Headline: "Blade 2" soundtrack merges electronica, hip-hop
Author: Jennifer Mosconi
&nbsp;
When you've already combined hip-hop with hard rock in a movie soundtrack ("Judgment Night") and hard rock with electronica ("Spawn"), there's only one avenue left. Happy Walters, head of immortal records, works his usual magic with the soundtrack to Blade 2, this time blending hip-hop with electronica. Wesley Snipes' character moves between the worlds of humans and vampires in the movie; the soundtrack straddles a similar line between clever inspiration and commercial gimmick.

I couldn't listen to this album straight through the first time I heard it. I was more curious about what Mystikal and Moby or Ice Cube and Paul Oakenfold would sound like together than whether the song was actually worth listening to. The soundtrack kicks off with the film's theme, a collaboration between composer Marco Beltrami ("Scream") and electronic producer and former Black Grape member Danny Saber. It's the only collaboration that doesn't faithfully fit the formula, instead blending electronic music with orchestral. That track, along with the Red Man and Gorillaz track "Gorillaz on My Mind," works well, but doesn't sound all that different from the average music fare. The other tracks, like the one that features  the pairing of Bubba Sparxx with Crystal Method, are worth a listen just for the weird value.

It's intriguing to hear how different hip-hop artists work with their electronic peers. Trina may call herself the "baddest bitch" but her track "Gangsta Queens" (with Groove Armada) is out-rapped, out-classed, and outdone by Eve and Fatboy Slim on "Cowboy." Oakenfold and Ice Cube work brilliantly together, while Mystikal and Moby are, at best, brilliantly mediocre.

The highlight of this album is the chance to enjoy BT once  again in his natural habitat. 

After collaborating on "Pop" with Nsync, I was terrified that BT would never make it out of the abyss of teenybopper music. Luckily for me and the rest of his fans, he's more than redeemed himself with the strongest track on Blade 2, "Tao of the Machine" with The Roots. 

Other strong tracks include the already mentioned "Gorillaz on My Mind," rumored to be the first release from the album, and "Cowboy" which has the potential to become a top 40 hit. 

The downside between the hip-hop and electronica blend is that the heavy rap vocals can drown out the more subtle elements of the electronica genre. Blade 2 succeeds despite that, providing an interesting diversion that is certainly worth a listen, and has got enough bite to keep you coming back.

Headline: "Resident Evil" drags horror flicks through soil
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Let's be quick and to the point: "Resident Evil" is a bad movie. It is everything you expect from an action movie based on a video game about zombies. You've got a cast of mediocre actors, gory death sequences, a paper-thin plot and, of course, flesh-munching proto-dead people. "Resident Evil" is also review proof. If you love bad B-movie zombie flicks, you'll love seeing this because it's exactly the same thing, but with a much bigger budget. If you hate bad B-movie zombie flicks, you already know better than to waste your time on this dreck.

The plot, if you must know, is something about some major company that designs biomedical warfare viruses in an underground laboratory called The Hive. Someone cracks open a vial of unspecified evil stuff, it infects everyone and the lab's supercomputer, the Red Queen, seals the place off to prevent contamination. Enter a bunch of stupid marine-esque commandos to unseal the place and die painful deaths. Among the commandos is Milla Jovovich, who has amnesia because of some gas she inhaled, so she goes around looking surprised about everything and kicking ass. There's also Michelle Rodriguez as a Hispanic hard-ass with guns and sass. Well, it's either sass or a penchant to say stupid stuff; I think it's the latter, but I suspect the writer intended the former.

What makes "Resident Evil" so bad is the fact that all of its "good" frights, the ones that could make you jump out of your seat, are fake-outs. And there are more of those than any other kind of frights. It's like a cliché formula driven to extremes: Set up about two minutes of ambient noise while a character looks around scared, then the moment they figure it's nothing, some jackass quickly puts his hand on the character's shoulder with a surge of trumpets and violins, scaring the character and the audience until they realize: "Oh hey, it's just that guy." After the third one of these in a row, you lose all respect for the film.

What makes "Resident Evil" so bad is the fact that the zombie is possibly the dullest evil creature in cinema history. Oh sure, the concept is intriguing: The dead coming back to life as decomposing corpses who eat human flesh. But who decided that zombies have to be so sluggish about it? They dawdle and moan with their hands extended in front of them. I've seen babies do that. Are babies scary creatures?

What makes "Resident Evil" so bad is the fact that it contains some of the worst "high-tech" effects ever. The zombie makeup consists of dousing the actors with liberal amounts of green-tinted talcum powder and asking them to drool some blue apple sauce. 

The zombie dogs look like greyhounds pissed off because someone spilled Ragu all over them. And the big, evil creature at the end, some sort of zombie hybrid DNA thing with a long tongue (please, don't ask), is possibly the cheesiest use of computer-generated imaging that I've ever seen. "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius" had more convincing CGI. Heck, so did the Playstation game in which this movie is based.

Even worse, you cannot possibly feel sympathetic towards the  characters without absolutely any personality. Let's forget that half of the characters in the film are never given a name we can remember (and this includes the people in the starring roles). 

What makes "Resident Evil" so bad is the fact that its director, Paul Anderson, takes the movie way too seriously. Part of the fun of zombie movies was the cheese factor, not the storyline and action.
Last and not least: What makes "Resident Evil" so bad is the fact that Hollywood is already planning a sequel, something the ending of this movie clearly indicates. If I have to see "Resident Evil II," I think I'll become a brain-dead zombie.

Headline: "Benjamins" mixes action, comedy
Author: Otmara Soberanes
&nbsp;
Any movie that has a title like "All About the Benjamins" is likely to attract a lot of audiences. When it comes to money, people always want to know the way to go about making more of it. "All About The Benjamins," directed by Kevin Bray and written by Ice Cube and Ronald Lang, teams up Mike Epps and Ice Cube to bring action and comedy together and give a new twist to the typical "good guy vs bad guy" movie. 

The movie takes place in Miami where Bucum Jackson (Ice Cube) finds himself in the middle of a shooting as he trails Reggie Wright, (Mike Epps,) a crook who skipped bail. 

Bucum's character is very determined to do his job and get paid from the beginning but instead ends up in frustrating situations that give him a bad reputation and keep him from opening his own office. 

But the shooting ends up being Bucum's golden opportunity as it turns out to be a drop off of diamonds worth four million dollars.
 
Meanwhile Reggie ends up in the van where the crooks took the diamonds after he hid there for protection. After finally escaping Reggie realizes that he left his wallet in the van along with a winning lotto ticket inside. Hilarity (and franctic action) ensue.

Gina, Reggie's wife, (Eva Mendes), becomes an important character to this movie. They couldn't have picked a better character than the one of Gina to compliment Reggie's unique and funny personality. 

Gina is a sexy but simple Latina who lives her life praying to her many saints in the hopes that one day she may win the lottery. Her hyper personality carries a touch of humor that grows on you. 

She, naturally, comes along with her husband in the search for the lotto ticket as well. Although Bucum is the hard-core type, strong enough to solve the case on his own, he ends up teaming up with Reggie.
 
The movie combines humor with Mike Epps and action with Ice Cube in a way that finds you laughing at Reggie's constant funny circumstances that blend with Bucum's serious personality. The plot of the movie is not the most unique one, but Epps definitely makes it worth our while by spicing things up. 

If you are in the mood for a hilarious, fast-plotted movie, go see this: It will fill your mind with all you need to know about the Benjamins.

Headline: "Project" tracks aftermath of crime
Author: Jennifer Mosconi
&nbsp;
Selected as the Opening Night Premiere at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, "The Laramie Project" is an HBO film that recreates the efforts of the New York-based Tectonic Theater Project to express the impact of Matthew Shepard's death on the townspeople of Laramie, and in a greater sense, the world.

Adapted from the acclaimed play of the same name, the film features an all-star cast including Steve Buscemi, Camryn Manheim, Christina Ricci, Joshua Jackson, Janeane Garofalo and many others. The script is written by Moisés Kaufman, the author of the original play, and is cohesive, entertaining, and thought provoking.

"The Laramie Project" represents two years and over 200 interviews with the townspeople of Laramie, who lived through the Matthew Shepard case, Matthew Shepard was a gay college student at the University of Wyoming. He met two men at a bar on October 6th, 1998, and left with them. 

Eighteen hours later, a cyclist found Shepard unconscious, beaten until he was barely recognizable and tied to a fence. He never regained consciousness and died five days later. The two men convicted of the crime were aged 20 and 21 and were residents of the small town. While the story is set into motion by the horrible acts perpetrated upon Matthew Shepard, his image is seen nowhere in the film. The focus of the film is the people of the town. We meet them, gain glimpses into their lives and watch them struggle to comprehend how such a crime could happen where they live.

What keeps this film riveting is its accurate portrayal of opinion. The words are based on the townspeople's own words, which run the gamut from sheer disgust at the cruelty of the murderers' actions, to those who believe the blame for the crime should be split evenly between Shepard and his attackers. The cinematography is brilliant, and the juxtaposition of the Laramie townspeople with clips of news from around the world illustrate the effect that the crime had on everyone. 

The arraignment and trials of the two defendants are shown, along with scenes from Shepard's life. Some of the most shocking scenes take place at the funeral. Seeing anti-gay protesters carrying signs saying "Matthew Shepard is burning in hell" on the same day that he is being buried is disturbing, especially when you take into account that this is a true story. 

I watched "The Laramie Project" twice and like it as much as I do perhaps because it hits home. My best friend is gay, and knowing that something like that could happen to him terrifies me. As college students, the majority of you know someone who happens to be a homosexual. This film might touch you. 

I don't wish to give too much of the film away, you really have to see it for yourself to understand its impact.

It isn't without its shortcomings; few films ever are. The famous cast can be distracting at points, whoever did the score should go back to compiling "Dawson's Creek" soundtracks, and since "The Laramie Project" is only 94 minutes long, it doesn't  tell the whole story. In defense of Moisés Kaufman, he deals with too much information to make everything perfectly correct; he does, however, capture the essence of the town in the aftermath of Shepard's death.

Subheadline: Por: Mary Aviles

&nbsp;
Había hecho caso omiso a las señales. O lo que era peor las había querido ignorar por alguna razón inconsciente, pero desde hace rato los gustos y colores ochentosos amenazan con volver y yo quiero evadirme de la realidad.

Primero fue ese aviso sobre That´s 80´s show, pero pensé que era otra de las ideas hollywoodenses de lo que debe ser el reciclaje. Después vi a un chico no mayor de 16 años con el cabello al estilo del último de los mohicanos y pintado de verde fosforescente, completaba su look con un atuendo de cuero, botas altas y remaches plateados.

"No es posible &#8211;pensé, la última vez que vi a un punk corría el año 87 en Londres". 

Luego, al salir de la universidad, una noche de estas me encontré a un grupo de jovencitos que intentaban girar el cuerpo sobre sus cabezas. 
Me voltee a mirarlos otra vez. Y aunque la música era algo diferente los pasos eran de breakdance.

Ya no tenía más dudas, los ochenta estaban aquí.

Recordé entonces los intensos ensayos, en los que mi hermano y yo intentamos dar vueltas sobre la cabeza, con el temor de perder una vértebra.

No creo que exista una generación que se arrepienta más de la vestimenta de juventud que aquellos que vivimos los ochenta. Y es que hoy vestidos de discreto minimalismo no nos queda otra que condenar esa década excesiva de colores y formas, y tratar de desaparecer las fotos en las que salimos con cruces a lo Madonna.

En esos años, yo, vestida con una camisa abierta sobre un solo hombro, como la de Jennifer Beals en Flashdance, y un pantalón pegado, de las caderas a los tobillos, increpaba a mi madre sobre su osadía al usar plataformas y pantalones con bota campana. Me parecía lo más horrible del mundo. Juré que nunca me vestiría así por más que la moda me lo dictara. Años después buscaba con ansiedad en los cajones de mi madre algún accesorio auténticamente setentoso.  

Hoy veo las revistas de moda y no se que me inspira el diseñador Alexander McQueen, no se ni amarlo u odiarlo. Amarlo porque me trae maravillosos recuerdos u odiarlo porque me hace sentir vieja. 

Hasta E. T. regresó después de 20 años.

Veo el dorado por todas partes. Pero definitivamente es un deja vu. Las bandanas, las bacterias y los colores brillantes de Cindy Lauper, los botines Converse, las cadenas y los alfileres hard core, los estampados escoceses.

Miro mi closet y predominan los colores neutros, gris, blanco, negro, azul marino. Uno que otro estampado y pocos colores brillantes. A veces me parece monótono, pero a la vez prefiero que siga así antes de verlo lleno de fucsias, aguamarina y azul eléctrico.

No se si a los chicos que bailaban breakdance en la Universidad les diga algo los nombres de Laura Branigan, Nina Hagen, Boy George y Culture Club, Modern Talking o Duran Duran. O si estén dispuestos a vestirse como Prince en Purple Rain o como Don Jhonson en Miami Vice. De seguro que sí.

Lo que soy yo resistiré, seguiré siendo minimalista y aunque esa época fue buena y me pone nostálgica, juro que nunca más me pondré hombreras.

&nbsp;
En Miami la diversidad cultural es de todo tipo y en todos los sentidos. La lista de latinoamericanos que viven la engrosan cubanos, venezolanos, argentinos, colombianos, puertorriqueños y mexicanos, entre otros, componen la mayoría de la comunidad "mayamense". 

Y es gracias a este coctel de nacionalidades que nuestra lengua salpicada de humor, diversión y a veces hasta de sabiduría criolla, alegra y le da color a la vida. 

El español de Miami se mezcla como en una especie de concierto, en el que cada acento y expresión idiomática hace del lenguaje una combinación de sonidos musicales. El sabor caribeño lo interpretan los cubanos con su "vaya", los puertorriqueños con su "ay bendito" y los dominicanos con su "oh, pero bueno". 

Los suramericanos también aportan a este concierto de palabras y modismos:los argentinos contribuyen con alguna que otra "boludés", mientras que los "berracos" colombianos y los "chamos" venezolanos no se quedan atrás en el uso de sus jergas locales.

Para los latinos en Miami no hay una forma de hablar mejor que otra. En esta ciudad todo se vale y no es raro escuchar en un mismo grupo de amigos o "panas" decir cosas como: "Vamos a rumbear a South Beach que el reventón es full bacano" o "Güey, vamos a parisear a la playa que esta súper chévere". 

No importa si esta mezcla de expresiones idiomáticas es correcta o incorrecta, porque entre nosotros los latinos nos entendemos de una forma u otra. Como dijo el lingüista José Antonio Pascual en una entrevista hecha por la revista española El Castellano, "queda claro que compartir una lengua significa compartir una cultura, lo que tiene que ver con nuestra manera de vivir y de sentir esa piel social".

Seguramente para los estudiosos del idioma este nuevo español está muy lejos de aquel que se originó en Castilla en el siglo XI. ¿A dónde irá a parar el castellano entre los 40 millones de hispanos y entre los muchos sajones que lo hablan? Qué importa, dejémosle esa tarea a los académicos de la lengua. Mientras tanto, sigamos comunicándonos.

Headline: Perfil: Rosa Necolardes, una vida de superación
Subheadline: Por Frances Alvarado
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Tal vez fue determinante la muerte de su familia para que ella misma supiera la lucha que le esperaba. Rosa amaba la vida y sentía respeto por la muerte. Un buen día aparecieron dos miembros del gobierno cubano. Los dos hombres pertenecían al Comité de la Revolución y se llevaron a  su padre sin explicación alguna.   

Y es que el Sr. Necolardes se desempeñó como representante de Fulgencio Batista, quien lo consideró su mano derecha en todos los asuntos del gobierno.

En busca de iniciar una nueva vida Rosa se mudó con su hermano a  La Habana.  Natural de la ciudad de Manzanillo, localizada en la parte oriental de la isla de Cuba, nunca había visitado la capital. Rosa terminó de estudiar ciencias secretariales y comenzó a trabajar en un bufete de abogados. 

En el 1969, su novio y un primo lejano salieron rumbo a España. Al encontrarse sola y vigilada por el gobierno, decidió solicitar permiso para salir del país. En una semana llegó el telegrama explicando los requisitos para obtener la visa. Entre otras formalidades, tenía que trabajar seis meses en el campo. 

La enviaron a Güines, un pueblo cerca de Pinar del Río. El viaje se hacía en unas guaguas lentas y no pasaban a tiempo. Algunos camioneros se ofrecían a llevarla, pero al montarse en el camión la acosaban y le hacían propuestas sexuales. Su trabajo consistía en sembrar 4,500 cebollas diarias y por la noche sentir el frío. "La residencia era una carpa de color marrón. El material era de saco o yute. Todos dormían  en literas. La gente se orinaba por el frío. En la mañana se podía observar el hielo en las plantas".  

Luego de cuatro meses la trasladaron a La Habana, a trabajar en una floristería al lado del Cementerio Colón. Allí preparaba coronas para los muertos. Pasó más de medio año y al solicitar la salida se encontró con una necgación. Ella salió protestando. "Estoy cansada, aburrida, quiero acabarme de ir". El jefe del departamento escuchó sus reproches y por indisciplinada la enviaron a trabajar a una granja. 

Finalmente llegó la hora de irse. "Era el año 1971 y mi novio me envió el pasaje. Atrás dejaba el recuerdo de mi familia y de una vida llena de retos".

Hoy, algunos estudiantes del Departamento de Geología de FIU, donde ella trabaja como secretaria, la describen como un personaje.  Para Fabián Duque, colombiano y estudiante de doctorado, Rosa mantiene su sentido del humor. "Siempre sonríe y se preocupa por nosotros, los estudiantes".  Juana Montanés una cubana-americana y estudiante de geología dice que "lo que hace a Rosa diferente, es que ella no le echa la culpa a Fidel de todo lo que le ha ocurrido en la vida, ni se pasa lamentándose, ni cree que Estados Unidos pueda resolver todos los problemas de Cuba".

En el cenit de la madurez, Rosa recuerda todo lo ocurrido en Cuba como un momento que le tocaba vivir.

Headline: Postal: Turquía, mezcla amigable de dos continentes
Subheadline: Por Tanya Lerner
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Ogla Sungutay y Baris Evran estudian en FIU, el primero Física y el segundo Finanzas, ambos tienen en común a Turquía, su país de origen. Para Ogla "es un lugar único y extraordinario, pues es como un puente que conecta las culturas oriental y occidental". 

De hecho, Estambul está parte en Europa y parte en Asia. Dos puentes conectan la ciudad con cada uno de estos continentes. Esta aparente dicotomía hace que Turquía sea una mezcla de las culturas europea y oriental. Para Ogla, su país hace parte del Medio Oriente más que de Europa, sin embargo, aclara que "este punto es objeto de mucha controversia". Otros turcos, cuenta Baris, se identifican más con el continente europeo.

Es precisamente esta mezcla de culturas lo que hace que algunos extranjeros no comprendan con facilidad la realidad de este país. Ciertas personas creen que por tener 99% de población de origen musulmán, Turquía es un país islámico. Sin embargo, explica Ogla, Turquía es enteramente secular, libre de inclinación religiosa, como lo indica su Carta Magna. La secularización, de origen europeo, se adoptó en 1923, cuando se formó la República de Turquía. Inclusive ha ido más lejos que en algunos países de Europa: las mujeres, por ejemplo, obtuvieron el derecho al voto en 1930, catorce años antes que Francia.  

De igual forma ha incidido en ciertas costumbres, como la vestimenta, la cual tiene más influencia occidental que oriental. Ogla y Baris señalan que la regla general es que las personas utilicen atuendos occidentales, y que sólo una minoría se incline por el ropaje tradicional de los musulmanes. 

En cuanto a las tradiciones europeas, en Turquía se utiliza el alfabeto latino y no el árabe. El lenguaje oficial es el turco y con frecuencia, los nombres de las personas tienen algún significado en este idioma. Ogla significa "niño", mientras que el nombre de Baris significa "paz".


Música

Otras tradiciones son más cercanas a las del continente asiático. La música folklórica, por ejemplo, tiene ritmos más orientales que occidentales, en parte por los instrumentos que se utiliza, como la Darbuka (instrumento de percusión).  A pesar de esto, en Turquía también se escucha música pop y rock, como se conoce en occidente. Uno de los intérpretes turcos más conocidos de éste género es Tarkan, quien se escucha con frecuencia en las calles de South Beach.


Cocina

La cocina en Turquía, es donde se aprecia con mayor facilidad la diversidad cultural del país. Se encuentran desde ensaladas de vegetales parecidas a las del Medio Oriente, hasta la típica comida mediterránea. Ogla cuenta que la mayoría de los platos tienen verduras y aceite de oliva: "éste es de muy buena calidad, y en ocasiones inclusive mejor que el aceite de oliva italiano". Como dato curioso, Ogla añade que el yogurt es un producto alimenticio originario de su país.

Gente

Este panorama general de las costumbres de Turquía, se complementa con la amabilidad de su gente. Baris hace énfasis en que los turcos se caracterizan por ser amigables: "si por ejemplo necesito cualquier tipo de ayuda en Turquía, se que puedo ir a una casa y que voy a recibir su colaboración. La gente es muy, muy amigable".

Baris y Ogla son tan sólo dos de los aproximadamente 40 estudiantes de origen turco que hacen parte de la comunidad de FIU. La amabilidad y cordialidad de ambos hace que provoque tomar un viaje expreso para conocer la verdadera Turquía: una mezcla amigable de dos continentes.

Headline: Megacon 2002 offers refuge for comic fans
Author: Lily Percy
&nbsp;
Until I watched "Mallrats" and entered the "Askew-niverse" that is the intricate domain of Kevin Smith and his films, my knowledge of comics was limited to Archie and that beloved Hispanic character Condorito. I had no idea that there was a world out there where comic books were taken seriously and seen as something more than just funny drawings with static captions that read: "Look out!" or things of that nature. I never thought of comics as being deep or moving pieces of literature. Hell, until I discovered Kevin Smith I never even thought about comics at all. But like I said before, that all changed with "Mallrats."

Fast-forward a couple of years since the "Mallrats" days, on through films such as "Chasing Amy," "Dogma" and "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back," and my love for Kevin Smith and comics has only grown. In between films, Smith realized a life-long dream by dipping his own ink into the comic book world with such best-sellers as "Daredevil," the "Jay and Silent Bob" and "Clerks" features as well as "Chasing Dogma," and his current critically acclaimed run on "Green Arrow." He has somehow managed to intertwine both worlds. I am sure that all who attended the recent Megacon in Orlando had this in mind when they forked over their $15 and made the trek to see the convention's guest of honor, Dr. Kevin Smith. 

For those of you that have not yet had the pleasure of attending a Comic Book convention and want to know what to expect from one, just watch the first 15 minutes of "Chasing Amy." It is about as close to that as anything else – you will see some strange characters at a comic book convention, including storm troopers, Jedi knights, Pokemon enthusiasts, Lara Croft and a tracer or two. 

When I arrived at the Orange County Convention Center where the Megacon was to be held, I immediately made a bee-line for the comic book floor where all the booths were set up and where the autograph line would be. The fact that there was "a line" didn't really phase me since it was, after all, Kevin Smith that we were talking about, but as soon as I saw just how long the "line" was I knew that I had no chance in hell of getting anything autographed. Rather than sulk, I decided to get a good seat for the panel, which would start two hours later. This quick thinking paid off and we were able to grab the third row facing the podium.

 About 600 people were squeezed in, and everyone was buzzing with anticipation. Five minutes later, after a funny and endearing introduction from Kevin's friend and comic book illustrator Jim Mahfood, Smith sauntered in with that adorable smile and blue sweater that we've all come to identify him with. He started by saying how great it was for him to be there, how thankful he was to us the fans and that the entire two-hour session would pretty much consist of us asking him questions and his answers to said questions. 

He was more than gracious in this respect; there was more than one dumb question asked, and yet each time he responded with honesty, wit and kindness. He is a great speaker, and you get the feeling that he could speak in length about any issue and you would be interested. He is also hysterically funny. I often felt like I was watching a stand-up comedian because Smith's stories and answers were just so damn hilarious. 

One such story that left everyone in the room rolling on the floor laughing was when he told us about the time that he picketed his own "Dogma." He had found out that a protest was to be held in reference to the film in his hometown and decided to join what he expected to be an angry mob but in reality was nothing more than a few senior citizens with cardboard signs. He ended up on the evening news protesting his own movie.

It isn't hard to see why Smith's films are so intelligent, witty and hilarious. When the two-hour session ended, it was obvious that no one wanted to leave the room. While my dream of personally meeting Kevin Smith was never realized and while I never did manage to get any of my "goods" autographed by the great one, the Megacon will always be one of the highlights of my-so-called life. 

Listening and watching Kevin Smith speak that day I realized something that had never occurred to me before: He is essentially the same person regardless of the situation or circumstance whether it is as a guest on Jay Leno or some other talk show, in an interview or in person. That is something that is damn near impossible in the land of celebrities – their job is basically to mold their personalities to what that particular audience or arena requires – and yet I honestly think that even at the Oscars Kevin Smith would still be that same adorable blue-sweater wearing guy. 

Lo and behold, Mr. Smith has taught me yet another life lesson at Megacon, one well worth the $15 dollars and 200 hundred miles.

Headline: Atrapado y sin seguro
Subheadline: Tanya Lerner
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Si cree que hizo un buen negocio al haber comprado la opción más barata para asegurar su carro, mejor revise con cuidado su contrato porque puede estar equivocado. Este &#8220;ahorro&#8221; le puede salir caro.

Algunos agentes de seguros de carro en Miami ofrecen una prima más baja que la de sus competidores, al incluir descuentos que no aplican al carro asegurado ni a su conductor. De este modo, el agente &#8220;atrapa&#8221; al cliente, al vender el seguro y cobrar su comisión por venta. Sin embargo, el asegurado resulta perjudicado sin saberlo, al tener que pagar más tarde un reajuste en la prima de su seguro, equivalente al valor de los descuentos que le fueron ofrecidos erróneamente.

Frances Alvarado y su novio Daniel Laó compraron la póliza de seguros para su carro con The Gainsco Companies sin imaginar que una semana más tarde recibirían una notificación de la compañía, en la que se les informaba que debían cancelar una prima adicional: &#8220;dimos un &#8216;down payment&#8217; de $287 en efectivo, y supuestamente el pago cada mes quedaría en $121.25. Cuando llegó el segundo pago nos pedían $211.57, lo que significa que quedamos a deber como 400 y pico dólares más&#8221;.  

Cuando Frances y Daniel llamaron a The Gainsco Companies les explicaron que los descuentos que había incluido la agencia no aplicaban a su vehículo. 

Según la guía para el consumidor sobre el Seguro de Automóvil del Departamento de Seguros de la Florida, si el agente cotiza una prima incorrecta, la compañía de seguros debe enmendar ese error. Si el cliente ha pagado en exceso, la compañía le enviará un cheque de reembolso. Si, por el contrario,  no pagó lo suficiente, la compañía le enviará una cuenta y le ofrecerá las siguientes opciones: pagar la prima adicional para la fecha indicada por la compañía si se quiere mantener la cobertura, o cancelar la póliza y obtener un reembolso de la prima. Si el cliente no toma ninguna decisión, la compañía tiene derecho a cancelar la póliza. 
 
Si se solicita la cancelación de la póliza y el reembolso correspondiente, Jorge Castellano, Especialista de Seguro del Departamento de Seguros del Estado de la Florida, señala que el valor del reembolso podría resultar mucho más bajo que el que se esperaría, toda vez que la compañía de seguros deduce del reembolso algunos costos. Según Castellano, haciendo un cálculo aproximado y no preciso, pues depende de cada compañía de seguros, si se da una cuota inicial de $200, el cliente podría recibir tan sólo $30 de reembolso, aún cuando el carro hubiera estado asegurado por pocas semanas.

Cómo operan

Como parte de la investigación se llenó una solicitud en el website www.insweb.com para obtener cotizaciones de los agentes de seguros afiliados. Al día siguiente, se recibió una llamada de un agente de Allstate que ofreció una prima inferior a otros.   

Se nos explicó rápidamente la cobertura de la póliza, sin mencionar que había descuentos que no coincidían con los datos llenados en la solicitud enviada por Internet, y que por esa razón, la prima del seguro salía $70 más barata a través de este agente de seguros.

Luego de revisar la copia de la cotización se le manifestó al agente que no correspondía a la realidad, y ésta indicó: &#8220;no te preocupes porque eso yo siempre lo hago; yo trato de poner todos los descuentos y nunca ha habido problema. Un señor al que le hice un seguro hace poco tuvo un accidente en la Calle 8 yendo a Naples y mató una persona; él tenía 20.000 de lesiones personales y la compañía se los ha pagado. Nunca nos han llamado, que si fue dueño de casa. Entonces, ¿me entiendes que eso cuando va a un reclamo no lo van a chequear?&#8221;.  

Al consultar la práctica de este agente de seguros con Delia Izquierdo, una de sus colegas de Allstate, ella comentó que &#8220;esa no es una forma correcta de trabajar; uno tiene que darle a la persona lo que en realidad tiene&#8221;. Para Delia  Izquierdo, su colega acude a métodos fraudulentos &#8220;para hacer la venta; para estar más competitivo&#8221;.

Otra modalidad que utilizan algunos funcionarios de las agencias al vender los seguros de carro, es incluir en la póliza los descuentos que corresponden, pero cobrándole al cliente una prima mayor, haciendo de cuenta que no aplicaban los descuentos. De esta manera, el agente de seguros no sólo gana con la comisión por la venta del seguro, sino que además se queda con la diferencia del valor de la prima cobrada de más a su cliente.

A dónde acudir 

Jorge Castellano, del Departamento de Seguros del Estado de la Florida, señala que en estos casos, donde el agente de seguros actúa de manera irregular, el cliente afectado en el condado Miami-Dade debe acudir a la División de Servicios para Consumidores de ese Departamento (401 NW y 2 Avenida Oficina N-307) y llenar un formulario explicando las circunstancias del caso, junto con la documentación apropiada, que puede consistir en cartas, recibos, facturas, contratos y anuncios. También puede llamar a la línea de servicio al consumidor al (305) 377-5235 y enviar el formulario de petición de ayuda por correo. El formulario puede obtenerse en el website www.doi.state.fl.us. 

También se puede hacer una reclamación ante la compañía de seguros directamente. En el caso de la póliza de seguros de Allstate se llamó directamente a la compañía y se denunció al agente. Allstate indicó que seguirá un procedimiento interno para determinar si el agente incumplió la reglamentación de la compañía, y en tal caso, considerará la posibilidad de retirarle la licencia.   

El procedimiento ante el Departamento de Seguros del Estado de la Florida puede llegar inclusive más lejos que cancelarle la licencia a un agente de seguros. Si la División de Servicios para Consumidores encuentra que hay méritos para iniciar una investigación más profunda, remite el caso al Buró de Investigaciones de Agentes y Agencias del Departamento. Patsy Bartola, funcionaria de este buró, explicó que la investigación de ellos se basa en determinar si existe &#8220;evidencia suficiente y clara para presentar una acción administrativa&#8221;. En caso de ser contundente la evidencia, el encargado de continuar la investigación será la División Criminal de Fraude. Si el caso prospera, el agente de seguros fraudulento podría terminar en la cárcel.
Sin embargo, el agente de seguros no es el único que podría terminar en la cárcel. De acuerdo con las leyes del Estado de la Florida, "cualquier persona que con conocimiento y con la intención de dañar, defraudar, o engañar a cualquier asegurador presente una declaración de reclamo o una solicitud conteniendo cualquier información falsa, incompleta o engañosa, es culpable de un crimen de tercer grado&#8221;. Esta advertencia se encuentra impresa en los formularios de todas las compañías de seguros de carro.
De manera que la próxima vez que compre el seguro de su carro, asegúrese de que la información que aparece en su solicitud es correcta. De lo contrario, recuerde que en vez de estar ahorrando unos cuantos dólares, podría acabar pagando mucho más, o inclusive, quedar atrapado sin seguro.

Headline: Snappy "Showtime" renews buddy formula
Author: Amanda Healy
&nbsp;
It's funny. Read all the professional reviews on "Showtime," and every single one is nothing but scathing criticism. However, go to any forum in which the public can voice its opinion and you'll read nothing but praise for this film. Indeed, it seems in this case that the experts are wrong. How shocking. 

"Showtime" is all laughs. There is nothing sappy or overdone about this movie. The basic skeleton of the story is anything but new. It is your typical odd couple flick, a formula seen too many times. Regardless, Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro manage to make it all seem fresh and entertaining. The one-liners never stop and there is actually a bit of mystery and an elaborate structure to the plot as well. 

"Showtime" is composed of two parallel and intertwining storylines. One is a lighter motif: the two lead actors' struggle to get along as their friendship develops. The other is a more serious theme as a criminal mastermind attempts to have his way within the city. The law races to solve this crime as DeNiro and Murphy fight to overcome their differences. 

Perhaps the main reason that this movie is not stale is that basically every actor involved is making fun of his or her off-camera personality. This is where the film's humor primarily lies. DeNiro plays an uptight cop, Mitch Preston, who is all about business and getting the job done. During the film, Preston is constantly being pressured to lighten up and he resists, succeeding only in appearing more and more silly as he occasionally attempts to make the best of an unwanted situation. There really is nothing more hilarious than seeing a notoriously tough and sophisticated personality like DeNiro  making defunct pottery – with a passion. Murphy plays Trey Sellars, Preston's absolute antithesis in every way possible. 

Sellars is a star-struck fool, seeking only the fame in crime-solving and he is constantly being made to look like an idiot by Preston's quick rebuttals. One thing this film really does is contradict and play off of stereotypes; in fact, this is where the plotline's filler comes from, and works very well for the humor. 

One of the funniest scenes is near the end when the movie's protagonists finally face off with the Latino antagonist, played smashingly well by Pedro Damian. He has such a  thick accent that, during a moment that should have been nothing but suspense, DeNiro and Murphy are forced to continuously ask the man to repeat himself for clarification. Damian does a wonderful job of slurring the words into unintelligible jargon. This moment is so rich with humor that it is further used at the end, during the outtakes. 

Murphy adds his own touch to the joke by poking fun at himself, asking the line to be repeated in "Ebonics." The laughs never stop coming, not even after the movie is over. The stereotypes exploited are not just cultural, though. No, the flair comes from dealing with contemporary issues as well; in this case, it is the engulfing trend of "Real TV" that is not safe from ridicule. 

The film cunningly injects both hilariously obvious and then more catchy, subtle jokes into the plot. This is the only true recipe for a successful comedy. Some jokes must be harder to notice so that they hit the audience from a different angle. 

One such instance in "Showtime" is executed by Rene Russo, who plays a story-hungry TV executive. In order to make DeNiro's character more appealing to the TV audience, she gives him a retired drug-finding cop dog, named Powder. This gag is further underscored as Powder sniffs at some sand, getting the white substance all over its nose.

For those of you out there in Movie-land who long for the classic, old-fashioned, comedic-action style of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the "Lethal Weapon" movies, there is hope yet. People are still trying to capture that magic that has spawned so many enjoyable continuations. While it is true that there is nothing long-lasting about these films, they are nonetheless golden. Yes friends, this is the stuff that sequels are made of.

Headline: Kylie heats up charts
Author: Alfred Soto/ Editorial Advisor
&nbsp;
Pop creates and populates a world of false memories. Listening to it instills a certain submission. Pop doesn't question social conventions (that's the job of great rock, from the Sex Pistols to PJ Harvey): it affirms them. We all remember to what song we slow-danced at prom and how glorious that moment felt, but we choose to forget the petty humiliations and pain our lovers inspired – at least not while the song is playing. A great Madonna song will walk all over you in gold-plated heels, and it's all good.

Kylie Minogue's Fever wants nothing more (or less) than to simulate ideal enjoyment. Coming in at an airtight (by which I mean airless) 53 minutes, Fever is almost guaranteed to chase Creed and Nickelback fans screaming from the room. It's about time something did. 

Minogue, a superstar of unimaginable proportions everywhere else in the civilized world, remains best known in the States for her yuppie robo-disco remake of "The Locomotion" back in 1988. She has survived grunge, Britpop, electronica and an ill-advised dabbling with rock. Kylie's a cockroach encased in gauze and glitter lipstick, Margaret Thatcher's greatest swindle on the British public – a slinky synecdoche for Tory dominance. As "Can't Get You Out of My Head" has already proven, she's back to retake the American colonies. 

Minogue's most rabid admirers (American critics, now that they're bored with the Strokes, have jumped on the locomotion) suggest she's "grown up" and is "stretching herself" on Fever. But, I mean, really – can you stretch Teflon? To call this album glossy is like saying Elton John wears ugly toupees. Fever never pretends to be anything but an obscenely expensive chartbound package. 

So does it work? Well, duh, yeah. Since Minogue's voice is so thin that it makes Janet Jackson's sound like Janis Joplin, her (many) producers layer the tracks with enough sonic detail to suggest a real human being somewhere in the mix ("suggest" is the key word). So you note with pleasure the title track's synth-bass squiggles, the Chic-style guitar bounce of future Top Ten "Love At First Sight" and how "Fragile" floats on a trancey groove just buoyant enough to affirm truth in advertising.
Great pop music always hints; it never asserts. If Minogue is only a couple of steps up the evolutionary ladder from Britney, at least she's smarter. When on "Give It To Me" she exhorts her lover to "go down" because she needs "a shot of love," she's not a girl and not quite a woman, an android who knows little girls will tee-hee over clumsy oral sex metaphors. Each song on the album is an embossed mirror, reflecting and holding Minogue's blankness for three minutes before the image shimmers away.

In the end, Fever evokes a great listening experience rather than actually being one. Even inflatable dolls get dirty once in a while, so I hope Kylie dares to make her music a little, how shall we say, vulgar next time around. Cop a feel from Pink and Aaliyah – singers unafraid of grit under their fingernails. 

Like most pop, Fever sounds artificial and off-putting, but believe me, it's infinitely preferable to the "sincere" emotions bands like Staind manufacture just as lucratively. Better false memories than bad ones, and in the pop world, both last about as long as it takes to flip the dial.

Headline: Everything you need and don't need to know about the NCAA's
Subheadline: Commentary on women's basketball
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
After spending five days in State College, PA for the first two rounds of the women's basketball NCAA Tournament, I decided to put together a list of superlatives (some important and some not).

Quotes of the tournament

There were some good ones for this category and two of them go to head coach Cindy Russo. 

During Saturday's press conference, Russo was continuously asked about her team's role as the underdog on Penn State's home court.  She finally responded with "Of course, we don't want to be here with their fans. Of course, we have a hard job. Of course, we know we're the underdogs.

After the following day's loss to Penn State, Russo was again asked about the effect that the home court would have on her team.  "Were you here yesterday," Russo asked the reporter.

Finally, after falling to Penn State on Sunday, Cormisha Cotton put Lady Lion Kelly Mazzante, who coninutally deflated FIU rallies, in perspective.
"She was shooting from everywhere. Everytime we tried to come back, she put a dagger in our heart."

Stupid questions of the tournament

A television reporter asked Gergana Slavtcheva two consecutive questions that fit into this category.

First, the reporter asked Slavtcheva how she liked Pennsylvania. This would be a good question for a tourist, but considering Slavtcheva only saw the hotel, the Bryce Jordan Center and the Ruby Tuesday's restaurant.

"The hotel is nice," Slavtcheva answered.

The next question was, "Would you be interested in playing 
professionally."

You think?

Worst value for your dollar

A 20 oz. soda from the vending machines in FIU's Marriot hotel cost $1.50. That's even more than the FIU price. 

Runs of the tournament

Each of the two games were decided, in large part, due to a run.
Penn State opened up an early 32-15 lead over the Golden Panthers with a 21-7 run. 

FIU took control of its first round game with Creighton early in the second half when Slavtcheva and Mandy Shafer combined to score 16 of the team's first 20 points after halftime.

Shots of the tournament

Mazzante's biggest dagger to  FIU's heart came eight minutes when FIU pulled within seven following 10 straight Golden Panther points. On the next trip down the floor, Mazzante hit a corner three-pointer in front of the FIU bench as the shot clock expired.

Shafer provided her own big three-pointer when FIU defeated Creighton. 

Midway through the second half, Shafer connected on a three that tied the game at 49. It was the first tie or lead for the Golden Panthers since late in the first half.

Contradiction of the tournament

The Penn State media guide boasts about the new Study Lounge that is located inside the team's locker room. 

It then goes on to say that the Study Lounge is equipped with a big screen television, leather furniture, stereo system and soda dispenser.

Sounds like a lot of studying gets done in that room. Must happen in between television shows.

Odd population fact

State College, PA has a population of 39, 571. The Penn State enrollment is 34,887.

Weirdest feeling of the tournament

Sitting in the press box as the final seconds ticked off the season, thinking about how long it has been since I covered a women's basketball loss.

Headline: Second half surge leads FIU over Creighton in 1st round
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
It took awhile, but once Gergana Slavtcheva and Mandy Shafer got going last Friday, FIU's women's basketball team took off into the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

The No. 5 seed Golden Panthers (27-5) defeated No. 12 Creighton (24-7) 73-58 thanks to a combined 26 second half points from Slavtcheva and Shafer, who had only three points each in the first.

FIU lost to host Penn State in the second round.

"We just said to each other that we weren't going to lose this game," Shafer said.

After going into halftime trailing 32-28, FIU outscored Creighton 45-26 in the final 30 minutes to move on to the second round of the NCAA Tournament's Mideast region in State College, PA.

It was the seventh time this season that the Golden Panthers trailed at 
halftime and the team is 4-3 in those games.

"I just kept reiterating the game plan," head coach Cindy Russo said. "I just kept reiterating the game plan and telling them 'If you don't do it – you're not going to be successful."

That message was well received by Russo's players.

"The games that we lost [this season] were because we didn't stick with the game plan," Slavtcheva said. 

FIU took advantage of the Blue Jays' second half game plan. Unlike earlier in the game, Creighton began to collapse on Cheryl Moody inside.

"The thing that frustrated me the most early was that we talked so much about how [Creighton} was going to focus on blocking off Cheryl Moody," Russo said. "It took them a little longer to do that. That was the key to the whole game."

Slavtcheva and Shafer both had a team-high 16 points. Slavtcheva added nine rebounds.

The pair scored 16 of the first 20 Golden Panther points following halftime, including a Shafer three-pointer that tied the game at 49-49 with 10:37 left in the game and provided FIU with the lift that it needed to finish off a victory.

"I had a little opening and hit the shot," Shafer said.

Moody, who scored 14 points, grabbed 12 rebounds and had five steals, used two free throws to tie the game again, less than a minute later and FIU never looked back as the Golden Panthers finished off the Blue Jays with a 22-7 run.

The Golden Panthers, who were forced into 18 turnovers in the first 30 minutes, limited themselves to one turnover for the final 10 minutes.

Cormisha Cotton had a double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds.

Defensively, FIU held the nation's sixth best three-point shooting team and wide-open offense to 10 of 40 shooting from behind the arc and 26 
percent from the field.

"[Creighton] spreads out like it's a golf course out there," Russo said.  "It seemed like they were shooting from half court."

"I think we did a really nice job defensively. They did a nice job keeping us off the boards in the first half."

That changed in the second half when FIU, who entered the game fifth in the country in rebounding margin, continued the season long trend – this time by a 53-35 margin. FIU is also 23-1 when its opponent scores less than 69 points.

Both teams had their share of foul trouble. 

Creighton's leading scorer, Christy Neneman picked up two early fouls by the 18:31 mark. 

When she returned at 10:04 of the first half, Neneman sparked an 18-9 Blue Jay run.

FIU's starting point guard, Deniz Boz spent much of the second half on the bench with four fouls. 

In her absence, Anita Heller ran the offense. 

Heller finished with four points and four assists.

Headline: Football opens spring practice
Subheadline: Strock focuses on toughness
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With a little more than  five months before its inaugural game,  FIU opened spring practice Monday with a focus on strength and speed.

Head coach Don Strock expects the three weeks of practice to be a test of both physical and mental toughness.

"In the next three weeks, we're looking to get bigger and stronger," Strock said.  "We need to get more physical than we are right now.  We'll be working on our speed, quickness, bulk, the whole nine yards."

"The offensive line was a little soft during the fall practices," Strock added.  "It needs to get tougher and stronger in order to get better."

Strock was pleased with the work ethic of some players who worked out on their own and have put on 15 to 20 pounds.

The strength of the team right now lies on the defensive side with the linebackers and the secondary. 

"The secondary and the linebackers are very good right now, but we still need to settle on some positions: linemen, receivers and others," Strock explained.

The players will be wearing shorts and helmets for the first few practices this week, which culminate on Friday with a scrimmage

"We're going to get a good look at some of these transfers," Strock said.  "We're very optimistic with these guys right now."

"We'll be working on our play action plays and the running game. With the exception of some new counter plays that we've put in, it'll be the same X & O's as before."

The quarterback situation will remain unchanged until  Jamie Burke arrives.  

"We like both David Tabor and Joe Fleming a lot, but we haven't made any decisions yet on that position," Strock said.

Burke will arive at FIU in time for summe school and to compete for the job.

Headline: Baseball goes 8-1 over spring break; opens Sun Belt play
Author: Alex Braswell, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In both teams' first Sun Belt Conference series of the season, FIU (23-5, 2-1 Sun Belt) took the last two games against New Mexico State (19-9, 1-2 SBC)  in Las Cruces, NM.

FIU is tied in second place in conference standings with Arkansas Little-Rock and Louisiana-Lafayette, whom the Golden Panthers play at home this upcoming weekend. 

FIU 12, NMS 10 

In the rubber match of the first conference series for both teams, FIU defeated New Mexico State 12-10. 

FIU starting pitcher Derek Decarlo, now 5-0, pitched six innings and had eight earned runs, striking out two. Relief pitcher Michael Mendez picked up his second save of the season.

The Aggies cut FIU's lead by two in the bottom of the sixth. FIU got some breathing room in the seventh by scoring two runs for a 12-8 lead.  

NMS 14, FIU 12

 In the first conference game and out-of-state roadtrip of the season, FIU lost to New Mexico State (19-7, 1-0 SBC) as the Aggies rallied from three back in the bottom of the ninth. 

SBC player of the week Kurt Wilkinson hit the game-winning two-RBI single off FIU relief pitcher Mathew Crandall (1-1). 

Hector Nuñez and Brad Eldred quickly put FIU ahead in the first off back-to-back homeruns. Eldred's was the first of three in the game, tying the school record in one game. 

Eldred blasted a 345 foot homerun over the left field fence to give FIU a 7-1 lead in the second inning.

Pitcher Arthur Santos went 4.1 innings allowing nine earned runs on seven hits for the no-decision. 

FIU 33, NMS 11 

In what resembled a football score, FIU won a one-sided slugfest 33-11. 

The Golden Panthers' 34 hits shattered their previous record of 28 set in 1981. 

FIU also tied for most runs in a game and most homeruns in an inning, with four in the second inning. 

Down 4-0 coming into the top of the second inning, Daniel Bustamante, Skip Adams and Dennis Diaz hit back-to-back-to-back homeruns in four collective pitches for their third, second and first homeruns of the season, respectively. 

FIU 16, Kansas State 10
 
Head coach Danny Price became the 35th NCAA coach to win his 900th game of his career as FIU defeated Kansas State (9-7) for the second time this season, 16-10. 

"Really, I didn't know that,"  Price said of his feat. 

"I do know [that] through the years, we have been surrounded by good coaches and good players and when you surround yourself with good people, good things happen. It's just a milestone along the way that I'm appreciated of everyone who's been a part of it."

Up 4-1 in the bottom of the third, FIU put up five runs to increase their lead 9-1. 

DeCarlo pitched 4.1 innings, allowing four earned runs on 10 hits and six strikeouts. 

"Yeah, you got to learn how to deal with adversity," DeCarlo said. "I just couldn't get ahead in the count."

FIU added its last run of the game in the eighth inning off a Diaz bunt single. He stole second, his fifth steal of the game, which tied the school record set in 1994.

FIU 7, Rider 1

FIU  defeated Rider (2-4) 7-1 as pitcher Luis Gazitua (3-0) set a career high by striking out 10, allowing one run on four hits. 

"I knew I had a lot of strikeouts, but I didn't know how many I had," Gazitua said. "I felt pretty good and I was able to get ahead on the count a lot." 

Up 2-1 in the bottom of the fourth, catcher Michael New injured his left  ankle as he slid feet first into third base. New suffered an oblique fibula fracture. He had surgery four days later; a metal plate was put in his left ankle with six-eight screws. 

FIU poured on five runs in the bottom of the fifth.

FIU 4, Ball State 3 

With a swing from his big 34- ounce bat, Eldred hit a two-run homer over the scoreboard in the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs to leapfrog FIU past Ball State (4-6) 4-3. 

"Going in the bottom half of the [9th] inning, I knew we had to get one guy on [base] for me to have a chance," Eldred said. "There is no better feeling."

Relief pitcher Derek Taylor (2-0) picked up the win as he pitched two scoreless innings. 

FIU 7, Miami (Ohio) 2 

FIU collected its seventh consecutive win defeating Miami (Ohio) 7-2. 

Carlos Sanchez started his first game, pitching 7 1/3 innings allowing only two runs on eight hits. 

FIU scored five runs in the first inning.  The Red Hawks chipped away at 

FIU's lead in the fifth inning as Andi Scheiddt hit an RBI single. Diaz added an insurance run for the Golden Panthers in the eight-inning for the 7-2 lead. 

FIU 9, Iona 4 

FIU defeated Iona 9-4 (6-4) last Monday night. Pitcher Luis Gazitua improved to 2-0 in the season.

Headline: Nealer 3 outs from no-hitter in softball split with No. 23 Minnesota
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Amanda Nealer lost a no-hitter in the seventh inning on a solo homerun, but pitched a complete game to propel FIU (27-19) to a 3-1 win over the No. 23 Minnesota Golden Gophers and earn a split of Wednesday's doubleheader at University Park.  

Minnesota's Piper Marten threw her own complete game in the opener of the twin bill, shutting out FIU, 4-0.

FIU 3, Minnesota 1

Not superstitious.  Not knowing and not paying attention.  Amanda Nealer took a no-hitter into the seventh inning of a 3-1 win in game two of the doubleheader.  

When she took the mound in the top of the seventh, she remembered 
what her coach said about the first batter she would face that inning.

 "Coach said, 'don't worry about the first batter, she's an easy out,'" Nealer laughingly said.

That first batter, Shelly Nichols, who had a solo home run in game one, sent the first pitch she saw from Nealer over the right-center field fence for a solo home run to ruin the FIU left-hander's no-hit bid.  

"I pitched normal.  [Nichols] just hit it well, but the no-hitter doesn't matter," Nealer said.  "We just needed to win the second game."

The superstitious coaching staff didn't say a word about the possible no-hitter.

"Earlier in the year, Amanda had a no-hitter going and one of the coaches said to me 'Amanda's got a no-hitter,'" head coach Kim Gywdir said.  "On the very next pitch, base hit! There goes the no-hitter.  But this time no one said a word."

Catcher Kristen Perry didn't start thinking about a no-hitter until the sixth 
inning, but she's unlike the coaching staff.

"She was on.  Everything she was throwing had good movement," Perry said.  "I didn't tell her anything about a no-hitter, but I'm not superstitious."

This is the third time this year Nealer has taken a no-hitter into either the final two innings.

She previously held UC Santa Barbara hitless into the 7th inning and had goose eggs in Florida's hit column into the 6th inning back in February.

The Golden Gophers did try to gain some momentum after the homer with a walk, but centerfielder Lesley Gillen snuffed out the rally.  Gillen, looking more like an Olympic diver, stretched out head first to snare a sinking liner in short center field.  

"I normally play deep, because I have better skills going forward on the ball," Gillen said.  "But I just had to make the catch, because we needed the win."

FIU scored all three of its runs on Minnesota errors.  

Jennifer Owens' stolen base and hustle got FIU off to a 1-0 lead in the 2nd inning.  Owens, who leads the team with 25 RBI, used her legs this time to score from 2nd base on a pass ball after Perry had struck out.

"It's the type of team we have, a lot of team speed and not a lot of power," Coach Gywdir said.  "We have to scratch and claw our way for runs."

The Golden Panthers capped off their scoring in the sixth inning.  After Perry doubled and Lindsay Tippings singled, Stephanie Wolter hit a grounder that had eyes and legs and got through shortstop Erin Wallace to allow Perry and Tippings to score the second and third runs for FIU.  

"I knew after the first game that our team would pick it up," Nealer said.  "And it's my job to pitch well and get us going again." 

Minnesota 4, FIU 0

Piper Marten's right arm carried Minnesota to a 4-0 win over FIU in the first game of the two-game set.  Marten surrendered three singles in blanking FIU, 4-0.

FIU 1, No. 14 Iowa 0

Kristen Perry singled in the lone run as FIU beat No. 14 Iowa, 1-0, on the last day of the FAU Parent's Weekend in Boca Raton.

Nealer, Leah Barnes and Kendra Laminack all combined for a five-hit shutout of the Hawkeyes.

Headline: Tennis defeats No. 9 Tennessee, Seton Hall
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While the FIU tennis team has been climbing the proverbial tennis mountain the past few years, the No. 9 Tennessee Volunteers have been atop it. 

But it was FIU who used a comeback effort to earn a 4-3 win over Tennessee.

Led by the gritty play of Mei Ly and Maria Montoya, FIU rallied from a 3-2 deficit to win its seventh straight match, sixth this year versus a ranked opponent.

After losing the doubles point, FIU rallied with singles wins by Cristina Campana and Marina Raic.

Tennessee regained the momentum in the match, 3-2, when the No. 1 singles player Vilmarie Casteuvi defeated FIU's Anneliese Rose, 6-3, 6-3.

The match came down to Mei Ly and Maria Montoya. Ly has been the hottest player on the team of late.  She's won 7 straight singles matches and is 12-4 on the year.

Ly, who played with a pulled muscle, was down one set and 5-2 in the second set, Ly won 11 straight games to turn her match around and finish off Kim Gates 6-7, 7-5, 6-0.

"After winning those 11 straight games, I just wanted to keep the momentum going," Ly said.  "I was really nervous out there, but I kept pushing to do the best I could."

After Ly tied the match at 3-3, the question remaining in the match was: 'Why Maria?'    

Montoya was given the nickname, 'Why Maria?' by Coach Bernstein when she arrived at FIU speaking hardly any English.   Montoya would always ask 'why?' about everything the Coach would speak of. 

Why Maria?  Because she can come through in the clutch. 

Montoya kept her composure, withstood her opponent's distractions and pulled out her match to seal Tennessee's fate.

Ignoring the constant complaints by UT's Agnes Wiski on ine calls, Montoya kept her cool and won 6-4, 5-7, 7-5.

"I wasn't sure of the situation [hers being the deciding match].  I just noticed a lot of cheering and screaming," Montoya said.  "As the time passed, I realized my match might count for something."

"After I won my match, I asked the other girls 'Did we win?'," Montoya said.  "When they said yes, I was so happy.  I've never been so excited before in my life."
Later in the week, FIU shut out Seton Hall, 7-0.

Headline: Gay adoption ban punishes children
Author: Helena Poleo
&nbsp;
No one can say their family is perfect and few people can say their families are even normal.  Nobody comes from a picture perfect home, with the white picket fence, mother wearing an apron, dad in his office attire, brown dog in the yard and 2.5 kids in the living room. Most of us have experienced fighting parents, possibly broken homes and hard economic times.  Our families aren't perfect, yet most of us are lucky: we have a family. As complicated as they might be, our parents or guardians worry about us and watch over us, trying to give us love as best they can.

But not everyone is this lucky.  Some children are raised in orphanages because their parents, for one reason or another, are not able to raise them themselves.  These kids grow up never knowing what a family is like, what it means to get Christmas gifts especially selected for them, or what it means to be tucked in at night.  These kids would give anything to be adopted. They would not question their new parents' sexuality.  They would simply be grateful for having their undivided attention and love, to feel wanted.  

Ask anyone who grew up in an orphanage and they'll tell you how they prayed every night to be adopted, no matter what their new parents were like.  The sad truth is that there are many more children without homes than parents willing to give them homes.

Florida is the only state with laws forbidding gay and lesbian adoptions.  However, gay couples are allowed to become foster parents.  Why the contradiction?  Apparently, this means that they're good enough to be foster parents, but not to become full-fledged parents.That is why lifting the ban on adoptions by gay couples in Florida is so important. 

 What it comes down to is that there are millions of children who need parents and the state is telling them they can't have them.  The state is telling the kids that they can't have a home, that they can't be loved, and that they must spend the rest of their lives in an orphanage.

It is very clear that the state must have the wrong idea of what the gay population really looks like.  State officials must think that all gays do is party in South Beach.  

I'm sure a lot of them do, right next to many more straight South Floridians.  Just like straight couples, the gay couples that apply for adoption are nothing like the partiers that officials have in mind.  Most couples, gay or straight, that apply for adoption feel that they are ready to be parents.  They are in a committed relationship, make a decent living and feel stable enough to bring a child into their lives.  

Adopting a child isn't like getting pregnant.  It isn't a random act caused by a moment of heated passion.  From what I gather from speaking to couples who have adopted, adoption is a long, hard road marked bybureaucracy, soul-searching and money-spending.  

When a couple decides to undertake such a difficult journey, it is because they are willing to love the child and raise it with the love and care it deserves. It is unfair to punish children who need homes because of the stereotypes legislators believe about gay couples.  

Truth be told, if a gay couple wants a child badly enough, they will find some way of getting it.  But that will not help the kids in the orphanages at all.  They'll still be there night after night, praying for someone to adopt them, to love them.  

Meanwhile, perfectly good parents will be turned away for no other reason than that they love someone the state officials don't agree with.  In the end, the children are the ones being punished.

Headline: Bush Administration crosses line between church and state
Author: Jason Andreasen
&nbsp;
As has often been the case, the Republican party's conservative views and the influence of the religious right, has cast a dark shadow over the policy choices the party has chosen to endorse. One needs look no further than the White House for the latest shining example. 

On Feb. 26, President Bush announced a new welfare plan that would expand on the 1996 reform pushed by President Clinton. Bush's proposal would appropriate $19 billion to the welfare budget. 

Regardless of one's views of welfare, or even the amount of money that the president has proposed to ask for, it is the usage of these funds that should cause all of us to be up in arms. 

Bush made his announcement, not from the White House or the steps of the Capitol, but not inappropriately, in St. Luke's Catholic Church. 

I say that this was not inappropriate because of the fact that the welfare plan that Bush proposed was chock full of religious propaganda. This is the same man who ran his campaign as a "uniter," not a "divider."

Bush's welfare plan calls for $300 million worth of spending on programs, administered by faith-based organizations, promoting marriage between low-income couples. This is a strategy aimed as much towards promoting a religious agenda as it is towards helping the disadvantaged. 

Simply think of the ramifications: increased number of marriages on the basis of economics, not love or emotional commitment. Doesn't that seem to run counter to the goals of such policies? And you think the divorce rates in this country are high now? 

Bush attempts to justify his plan by citing the fact that children of homes with two parents are less likely to become involved with drugs and/or crime, thus the federal government should advocate marriage. It is this kind of faulty logic, or lack of any at all, that has made Bush the butt of countless a late-night joke. 

Simply citing this fact does not necessarily show that the drug usage or criminal behavior was actually caused by the absence of a parent. It seems that it might have been due to a number of things, like, hmm, poverty! However Bush apparently feels that causality is unimportant, and thus, we should not use that $300 million for more effective programs. Not convinced that this is further evidence of the Bush administration's continued attempts at diminishing the separation of church and state? 

Bush's plan also calls for an additional $135 million to be spent on programs encouraging abstinence among young people. Why not sexual education? Why abstinence? Because the Republican Party feels that it is their duty to impose "good Christian values" on the people of America, whether they like it or not. 

Some would say that if you do not agree with these programs, simply do not participate in them. These would most likely be the same people who agree with religious right leaders such as Jerry Falwell that the Sept. 11 tragedy was caused by gays and diminished family values. 

However, the truth of the matter is that we are participating. The proposal calls for taxpayer's dollars to be spent on these programs, dollars that all Americans have contributed to the national budget. They have contributed via taxes, regardless of their faith. 

I find it appalling and offensive that the Bush administration would propose to use the taxpayer's dollars in such a manner, with such an obvious and overwhelming political and religious agenda. I do not mean to belittle the importance that faith and even religion can play in a person's life. For that, perhaps they should be applauded. However, the federal government should not fund religious practice and beliefs. The Founding Fathers would roll over in their graves if they knew that ol' "Dubya" was working this hard to do away with the separation of church and state. 

With every religion-laden policy the Bush administration offers up, we seem to be one step closer to an established religion. This of course will become even a more frightening reality when it comes time for Bush to nominate a Supreme Court justice. People came to America to escape the very society that Bush is bringing us closer to.

As wartime presidents have in the past, Bush is experiencing an extremely high approval rating. As has also been the case in the past, the involvement of the United States in a war tends to overshadow domestic happenings. 

If we weren't in a war, the policies that the Bush administration is trying to pass would not be as unnoticed as they are. I'm sure that the administration is not ignorant of this truth.

How dare the White House take it upon themselves to attempt to impose religious values on the American people. It is not the place of the government to preach or to make poor people adhere to Christian values. 

They should not be offering to pay the underprivileged in this country, with federal government money, to follow the teachings of Christianity. Such policies fly in the face of what America was intended to be. 

Then again, I could be wrong. In which case, perhaps those of us who actually believe in the First Amendment should find another Plymouth Rock and start this whole thing over again.

Headline: Rape remains serious issue
Subheadline: Columnist relates personal experience with rape, shame
Author: Virginia C. Cornett
&nbsp;
I've never considered myself a feminist though I am a strong, independent woman who sees grave injustices and double-standards pervading our society even in the 21st century.  But a true feminist? No. 

Today, however, I'm rethinking this all.  And today, I am truly afraid for the world.  At a website for an organization called "Take Back the Campus," I found this bit of  "information:"

"Myth:  One in four women in college has been the victim of rape or attempted rape.

Fact:  This mother of all factoids is based on a fallacious feminist study commissioned by Ms. magazine. 

Seventy-three percent of the young women counted as rape victims were not aware they had been raped.  43 percent of them were dating their 'attacker' again."

The information from Take Back the Campus comes directly from their website – the words have not been paraphrased or manipulated by me or this newspaper. 

Can any rational human read this paragraph and not be curious about these statements, or at least by the conclusions drawn.  

The statement that 73 percent of the young women included in the study were not aware they had been raped is possibly, even, probably true.  

But the writer, in attempting to dispel this "myth," implies then that a) the women weren't really raped, just labelled as rape victims by those evil men-hating feminists, b) that since the women didn't even know they were raped, it doesn't affect them, and c) that 73 percent of the population surveyed should not have been included in the original reporting of the study.   

There are many women who were, in fact, raped, but who choose to protect themselves emotionally by either suppressing the memory or by choosing to call it something other than rape. 

A woman may convince herself that she actually wanted to have sex with her attacker or that she did something to make him think having sex with her would be okay, but that doesn't mean it never happened.

 What's my source, you ask?  You want some fancy statistics or professional references to back up my claims?  My fancy statistics and references come from a source that can't get any more valid.  They come from me--a woman who was actually raped and who ignored it as a crime, or even that it actually occurred, until 10 years after the fact.  

A woman who endured years of hospitalization, psychotherapy, and drug treatments just to realize that she was not at fault and that, yes, this was a crime that was affecting her life. I did exactly what that Take Back the Campus myth-expeller extraordinaire said I was 73 percent likely to do. 

I suppressed it, ignored it, let it fester until it broke open like an old wound.

And why did I do that?  Why do such a large number of women respond the same way when they have been victimized?  

Because people like those at Take Back the Campus make us feel like we are somehow mistaken about whether a crime has been committed against us or not.  Contrary to popular belief, a great majority of rapes do not occur by a nameless attacker leaps out from the bushes.  

Rape victims usually know their attacker, and that is probably why it is so easy to justify.  It's easy to go to the cops and say "some savage looking guy in a ski mask attacked me as I was walking home" if you can't put a name or a personality or a history to the attacker.  

But some guy you meet at a party who tells you how beautiful you are and that he's waited his whole life to be with someone like you, who then takes you to his room and forces/coerces you into having sex with him, that's different.  

Maybe my skirt was a little too short and my shirt cut too low.  Maybe I didn't say "no" forcefully enough.  Maybe he was just so enraptured by me he just couldn't help himself.  

And then the researcher has the audacity to say that 43 percent of women "attacked" were dating their "attacker" again (Note the quotation marks around the word attacker. This suggests that the word "attacker" is misused by those evil man-hating feminists).  

So those women who are "beaten" by their husbands who continue to live with them and be "beaten" by them do not have real bruises and scars and broken bones because they remain with the "abuser" out of fear or shame?  

And, according to the findings, the abuser is not really an abuser anyway; the women actually wanted to be beaten and it is the authorities who have wrongfully classified it as abuse.  This is just senseless, frightening anti-women idea.  

And again, unfortunately, I have my own proof.  I saw my rapist around campus quite often.  

I spoke to him whenever I saw him and never mentioned or even alluded to the crime that he had committed against me.  

Does this make a rape any less a crime? Does that make me any less a victim?  Does that mean that I didn't feel my body tremble with shame and fear when I saw him in the student center or that I didn't walk with my eyes cast downward, avoiding looking him in the eyes?  

Does that mean that 10 years later, when I became anorexic and suffered indescribable mental torture and woke up in cardiac intensive care after a nearly fatal intentional overdose mixed with alcohol, that I had been any less victimized as a young college freshman away from home for the first time?

There are people out there intent on keeping women from feeling like whole, valid human beings.  Just because I am intelligent enough to undertsand the concept of rape, does not make me a man-hater. 

Who I do hate is those people who ignore the crime of rape and the anguish that rape victims endure.  

Men need to know that rape is "sexual intercourse with a woman by a man without her consent and chiefly by force" and date rape is "rape committed by someone known to the victim."  

You know when a woman doesn't want you to have sex with her, and her being too drunk to stop you is not an excuse.

Women, if you have been sexually assaulted and haven't yet dealt with your abuse, please seek attention from a professional. 

You can visit the Victim Advocacy Center at 348-1215 (GC 195A). For emergency assistance, call 911. 

Whatever you choose to do, just remember, rape is a crime and you do not have to feel guilt or shame for reporting it.

Headline: American television hits all-time low
Author: Myriam Marquez
&nbsp;
Two trailer-trash girls duke it out on national television. We should laugh it off as just another example of American frivolity in a culture of excess. Fat and supposedly happy Americans don't take themselves too seriously. Even after the horror of Sept. 11, everything's seemingly back to "normal."

Except I'm not. The banality of what passes for normalcy in our society continues to astound even this child of pop culture and former addict of round-the-clock television.

As a youngster, I learned rudimentary English, thanks to Lucy and Ricky and Ethel and that cheapskate husband of hers, Fred. I learned valuable economics lessons – particularly the cost of chi-chi things that were prohibitively expensive for my family – by watching "The Price is Right." 

Comedy shows, game shows, even soap operas helped lighten the mental load of a latchkey kid of the duck-and-cover nuclear '60s. I was not alone. American kids were glued to their television after school – little spuds in the making of couch-potato heaven.

They still are, but today's shows seek out the lowest uncommon denominator in our society. This hasn't happened overnight. It has taken decades to spiral uncontrollably downward, and every time I think there's no other place to go but up, another pathetic show or two or three drags us down. 

Last week's new low in television viewing may have caught my attention because I just had returned from traveling to a country where two government-run channels are the Cuban people's only choices. Given dozens of choices here at any given hour, what do Americans settle for?

Celebrities with little box-office flair (a Backstreet Boy among them) letting bugs, worms and snakes crawl over them in NBC's "Fear Factor." 

On TNN's "Fame for 15" we were treated to short biographies of tangential no-names like Donato Dalryrmple, the fisher guy who plucked Elian Gonzalez from the sea and then held tight till the bitter end, and Divine Brown, the Los Angeles streetwalker who latched on to Brit star Hugh Grant for her 15 minutes and then some.

But the absolute talk of the airwaves was a match that didn't take but a couple of minutes, if that much, between two scandal-mongering bad girls on the Fox Network's "Celebrity Boxing" show. Tonya Harding, infamous for plotting to smash skating rival Nancy Kerrigan's kneecap before the 1994 Olympics, relentlessly pounded Paula "I'm A Good Girl" Jones, whose sexual-harassment lawsuit against Bill Clinton led to political investigations that uncovered an intern named Monica  Lewinsky. 

Of course, Jones only wanted her good name cleared. And Clinton the scum bucket should have apologized and spared us all the humiliation of two-plus years' coverage into such boxer wars. Why care? Clinton's a has-been. And after posing in tight jeans and for a nude magazine spread, plus getting a new nose, Paula's good name can't be murkier. But isn't that precisely why people tune in to watch such spectacles? 

Paula always could say she was being a good sport. For Thursday's match, Paula stepped in for another bad girl, "Long Island Lolita" Amy Fisher, who probably could have creamed Tonya had the parole board allowed Amy to rumble. But alas, Amy had to pretend to be nice by parole-board decree and poor Paula, who looked like a squawking hormone-pumped hen running from the athlete Tonya in the ring, had to do her "nice" thing just one more time.

There were other has-beens bopping one another in the ring: Todd Bridges (the troubled druggie kid Willis of "Different Strokes") iced forgotten rapper Vanilla Ice. "The Partridge Family's" Danny Bonaduce bopped Barry Williams of "The Brady Bunch.''

It was all meant in good fun, to provoke a laugh or two. In another time perhaps I would have shared a few giggles with the family and friends, rolled my eyes about the latest tacky turn in Americana and that would have been that. Hard to imagine it would get any sillier, but it will. History has taught us that. Rome burned. The New York World Trade Center towers crumbled. And television's still for cheap thrills.

Headline: In Our View: SGA Campaign week needs more student involvement
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As the spring semester reaches its finish line, students will once again be able to slide their FIU ID cards and fill out ballot boxes to select their student leaders for the next academic year. The candidates are familiar, as are some of the issues: visibility, school spirit and improved student services. One could guess that the sometimes repetitive nature of these elections are a turnoff to those students who only come to FIU to take classes and are not involved in clubs or other activities.

They're probably right. But the fault doesn't lie solely on the candidates running for office, or the students who actually do get involved in these elections, the fact is simple. You can't complain if you don't participate. Those students that bemoan the actions of student government should take a quick peek in the mirror and analyze their role in this. Voting isn't a chore, but a privilege we have that allows us to have a greater say in how this university is run. If the majority of students continue to skip out on that chance, they have no right to complain about seeing the same people in office or about the way events are run or created. It's not surprising that candidates cater more to larger organizations instead of sitting out in the sun handing out fliers to students on their way to class. The big groups vote, because they're interested in having a say.

If more students took that idea to heart, things could be very different. It's very easy to sit back and complain about the way things are, but it's much harder to take a step toward changing how things could be. All students, even those who only visit the university for brief moments every week, need to realize how vital their one vote is. 

Which is not to say SGA has done a poor job, or is deserving of an influx of new people. They've made the best of the poor hand they've been dealt and put in a solid effort toward bringing more people to the polls. The responsibility lies with the students. Be critical of the candidates. Make your voice heard. Ask questions. And most importantly, vote on April 2-3.

Subheadline: Fifth seed women's basketball falls to Penn State at NCAA Tournament
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
The ride, the season and the streak are over now thanks to the nation's leading scorer, Kelly Mazzante and the Penn State Lady Lions 96-79 win on Sunday night in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

In front of an electrified crowd of 6968 at the Bryce Jordan Center in State College, PA, Mazzante's 32 points and the Golden Panther's worst defensive showing of the year was enough to end FIU's 13 game wining streak and send the No. 24 ranked team home.

FIU advanced to this game by defeating Creighton two days earlier.
Penn State took control of the game early, using a 21-7 run to open up a 32-15 lead with 9:34 left in the first half.

FIU (27-6) made runs throughout the remainder of the game and shrunk the deficit to single digits on two different occasions.

"We played disciplined basketball. We didn't get down when they came back on us," Penn State head coach Rene Portland said.

Two Gergana Slavtcheva free throws with 6:03 left in the first half brought FIU within eight points and made Slavtcheva the third all-time leading scorer in the program's history. Slavtcheva passed assistant coach Andrea Nagy.

Eight minutes after halftime, FIU cut a 17 point Penn State lead to seven when Heller converted a steal into a fast break lay-up and Cormisha Cotton followed with a lay-up on FIU's next possession.

On the next trip down the floor, Mazzante hit a three pointer with the shot clock expiring to increase the Penn State lead to 71-61 and end a 10-0 FIU run.

Heller was the catalyst for the Golden Panther runs, scoring 16 points with three steals.

FIU would not get any closer thanks to Mazzante and the host Lady Lions (23-11) closed out the game on a 28-20 run.

Two Mazzante three-pointers damaged the Golden Panthers' hopes. Penn State would later increase its lead to a game-high 21 points when Tanisha Wright put back a rebound for two of her 26 points.

"[Mazzante] was shooting from everywhere," Golden Panther center Cormisha Cotton said. "Every time we tried to come back, she put a dagger in our heart."

Mazzante converted six of 11 three-pointers.

"She really is in a world of her own sometimes," Portland said. "And I just kind of leave her alone."

Cotton was a bright spot for FIU, scoring 20 points and grabbing six rebounds.

Seniors Slavtcheva and Cheryl Moody finished their FIU careers with 28 combined points. Karen Roxborough also finished her collegiate career.

"This is not a time of the year that any coach likes to have to say goodbye to seniors," FIU head coach Cindy Russo said. "We have just wonderful memories of this team. We've had an exciting, wonderful year."

Penn State shot 56 percent from the field and 53 percent from three-point range.

"Most of the time, we were four players playing good defense and one girl broke down," Russo said. "Four players were playing good defense and one wasn't doing her job. That was tonight for us."

The loss was only the second when FIU scores over 70 points. The Golden Panthers are 23-2 when scoring over 70.

FIU ends the season as Sun Belt Conference Champions and reached the round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament. Before losing to Penn State, the Golden Panthers had won 17 of 18 games.

"This was definitely not the FIU team that won the Sun Belt Conference," Russo said.

Moody's 14-point night made her the 14th FIU player to reach 1,000 points. 

Mandy Shafer recorded nine rebounds to go with her eight points and Silvia Mesa scored seven.

Penn State's Jess Strom finished with 14 assists, placing her eighth in NCAA Tournament history.

Headline: Students run for SGC positions
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Candidates running for student government's open seats kick off their campaign this week. Campaigning events will run through April 1.

Students will be allowed to vote on April 2 and 3 and the results will be announced April 4 at 12 p.m. in the Graham Center Pit. Although according to the Student Government Council's Election Code, only three polling sites are required, four will be provided. 

The polls will be located in the Graham Center Pit, the Green Library, the housing breeze way and the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences, located just north of UP on Flagler St. and SW 107th Ave. Polls will open at 9 a.m. and will close at 7 p.m.

During last year's election, the fitness center, next to the Golden Panther Arena and the Charles Perry Building were used as polling sites.

"The voter turn out at the fitness center was really low," Elections Commissioner Malik Wilkes said. 

On March 27, a candidate debate will be held in the GC Pit at 12 p.m. 
"Lower division candidates, at large candidates and then it will be the actual debate between the tickets," Wilkes said. "Dr. John Stack will ask questions and then students will get to ask questions."

During a mandatory meeting for all the candidates running for office held just before spring break, Wilkes let the candidates know about some of the rules and regulations they will have to abide by during campaign week.

According to the 2002 Supplemental Elections Guidelines, failure to attend mandatory scheduled candidates' meetings, exceeding legal amounts of contribution on expense statements and attempting to qualify for candidacy under an assumed name are just some of the reasons candidates may be disqualified.

For lesser violations, students may be fined from $10-$35.  Lesser penalties of $10 include posting on painted surfaces, glass or doors or cafeteria umbrellas. Posting items on university grounds or roads carries a $15 fine and campaigning before campaign week is a $35 fine.
Presidential, vice presidential and representative candidates are limited in the number of easel signs and banners they can use during the campaigns. 

Presidential candidates can use two banners, students running for vice president can use one banner and students running for representative positions can use only one banner. They can use three easel signs each.
This year, students will not be allowed to use "A-signs" during the elections.

"Last year there was a problem and I feel we've come up with ways of replacing them," Wilkes said. 

"Pole signs" will be allowed.

"If a pole sign is stolen, it's not reusable," he said.

Headline: Maidique speaks at BBC
Author: By Lissette Asencio / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU President Modesto Maidique discussed budget cuts and the construction of a new marine sciences building at a Town Hall Meeting at the Biscayne Bay Campus' Wolfe University Center auditorium March 14.

Maidique spoke on the significance of the processes taken to establish a marine sciences building at BBC, as well as the initiative FIU is taking in reviewing the undergraduate curriculum. 

The reason for this new interest is Maidique's interest in "making FIU a top, public, urban university."

Site selection for the marine sciences building has already been taken care of and plans of building the actual structure are currently underway, Maidique said.

Regarding the budget, Maidique said there was a cut of about $12 million after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and that it had been said that another budget cut could occur the following year.

 "We will not, this year, get out of the hole that we were thrust into last 
year."  Maidique said, "That hole is not going to get deeper."

Also, the undergraduate curriculum usually receives review normally every 10 years, Maidique said. Yet, he said FIU is reviewing the curriculum more often. The reason for this action is "to understand the undergraduate curriculum's strengths and weaknesses."

Maidique also said a public hearing will take place on April 23 to see the changes that occurred due to the revision.  He said a new recreation center and expanded cafeteria were two things in the process of being built.

Several students questioned the president about different issues. One particular student asked him what he saw for FIU in the next 10 years.  The president responded that he did not look that far ahead at this point in time, yet he would like to see several things become a reality such as a research center for marine biology, an another dorm building.

Headline: South Asian students start new fraternity
Author: Robert Valencia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Florida International University has grown rapidly during the last decade, and thanks to this achievement, some organizations and fraternities have been created as well. Beta Kappa Gamma is a new fraternity at FIU.

Beta Kappa Gamma was founded primarily in the University of Austin, Texas on May 6, 1999.  This fraternity was created for Indian men who are interested in Greek affairs.  Since then, Beta Kappa Gamma has extended to different universities, including FIU.

"Beta Kappa Gamma is a fraternity that is mostly concerned with community services," BGK President Anis Patel said.

In fact, BKG has performed community service with organizations such as the American Lung Association and the Austin Capital Area Food Bank in Austin, Texas.

The purpose of this fraternity is to foster discipline, academic excellence, and integrity in each member; also, to unite Indian men while also impacting their community.

 "BKG has a big brother/big sister relationship with Alpha Kappa Delta Phi, an Asian interest sorority. Thanks to this alliance, they have brought the Asian community together," Patel said, highlighting some organizations that work along with BKG.

One of the biggest projects of BKG is Brother Kollecting Gifts, a week-long toy drive that have benefited the Austin Children's Shelter.  This event has risen over $2,500 in funds for toys.

BKG has also worked along with the National Children's Leukemia Foundation and Operation World Hunger, which rose over a $1,000 in funds to sponsor fifty children.

BKG is a non-profit organization geared towards helping the community. BKG primary philanthropy is raising awareness and providing assistance to disabled, neglected children.

Social and culture events are also significant for BKG. Events such as the ISA Fall Talent Show and the Festival of India encourage Indian students to participate in South Asian cultural dances. The Spring Gala and Bi-Annual Charity Party recognize the achievements BKG have reached and also, to bid farewell to graduating members. 

Samya is a professional program that created a network of Indian organizations, which provides easy access to alumni contacts at top firms and professionals from member organizations.

One important point of BKG is brotherhood.

"Brotherhood is the reason why students around the country have decided to join fraternities. Brotherhood is what gives a house personality; it's what gives a student security and encouragement after leaving home. Brotherhood is something that grows with age," Austin, Texas BK member Shaheed Momin said.

Patel describes Brotherhood as "the conjunction of trust, integrity, and responsibility in the highest regard; building a family atmosphere that makes every single member feel at home."

Some of the brotherhood activities in this organization are poker night,  a camping trip, and sporting activities.

Beta Kappa Gamma has an extensive constitution that stipulates every single rule with the intention of carrying on its principles.

For example, in order to become an active founder, it is necessary to maintain a minimum GPA of 2.5 upon signing the constitution. Members are also eligible to vote on all general BKG issues.

Beta Kappa Gamma would be the first Indian fraternity at FIU. 

"BKG wants to learn from the experiences minority fraternities have had, such as Lambda Theta Phi, Phi Beta Sigma and Phi Gamma Delta," Patel said. "We also feel the necessity of including a fraternity for South Asian, specifically men from India, since FIU is the best place for BKG to reach Indian community."

Patel also emphasizes that "this fraternity recognizes the ethnic diversity in the university, and the effort FIU makes to carry on a comfortable atmosphere for students of different cultural backgrounds.

"Without doubt, this is the best opportunity for Indian students to join this fraternity, so they can reach a new perspective in their careers and let other FIU students the importance of Indian culture," Patel said.

As a result of BKG's creation, FIU will have more ethnic diversity with more opportunities to serve the community.

Although BKG was created for the Indian community, it also serves students from all parts of the world and from different and diverse countries such as Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Dominican Republic.

Headline: Children's center gets federal grant
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Last October, FIU's Children's Creative Learning Center, a certified on-campus preschool for children from the ages of 2 1/2 to 6 years old, received the CCAMPIS (Child Care Access Means Parents in School) grant from the United States Department of Education. 

The grant, which is awarded to child care facilities for four years at a time, is specifically set aside by the government for child care facilities operating on or otherwise affiliated with college campuses. 

"I am excited to have been awarded the CCAMPIs grant because it offers the opportunity to enrich our program and open our doors," said Nancy Ponn, director of the Center. 

The preschool, which has been a part of the FIU family for over 25 years, applied for the grant for the first time last year. The grant "allows us to offer a discounted rate," Ponn said. 

The grant will increase the number of low-income students served, defined as people who attend FIU for at least nine credit hours a semester and qualify for the Pell grant, to 43 percent.

For example, whereas the regular monthly-subsidized rate for a new student is $328, students eligible for this award now only have to pay $164. Also, these students would be exempt from the registration and supply fees, $100 and $70 respectively.   

 "The grant will help the Center in multiple other ways as well," said Janice Lopez, assistant director of the Center.

For example, a sixth classroom will be constructed, the staff will now receive better training from certified professionals, and study areas for parents will become a reality. Also, the Resource and Enrichment Center can now offer more services thanks to the increase in number of the children, parent and staff lending library, the new classroom outreach provision and the new study area for parents.  

 "[The grant] helps the center by equipping our enrichment resource center and lending library. Also, now we can hire people to come in and do workshops," said Ponn. In reference to the portion which covers the costs of equipment and supplies, Pane said that they can now purchase new computers and programs. 

The center currently serves 60 families, not all of which consist of FIU students and their children. Staff, faculty and anyone who lives in the vicinity of the school is encouraged to join.

Apparently, people have been paying attention. Today, over 100 children remain on the school's waiting list. According to Pain, some were placed there even before their birth; the program is that unique. One of the reasons may be the Center's technique.

 "Our philosophy," Ponn said, "is very much geared to the children's self esteem and confidence. Every activity they do here is based on enhancing these aspects of their personality. That's done by means of helping them identify and express themselves."

One of the Center's annual activities is known as International Week. During this week, the parents of the Center transform the classrooms into different countries. The children figuratively travel around the world by visiting a different country (classroom). While there, they sample a national snack, song, dance, story, etc., prepared by the parents. The week is culminated by an International Feast held on Friday, when all of the families, both children and parents, sample foods from the various countries on display in a buffet-style dinner. 

"Each family will prepare a tasty treat from their country for all to enjoy," said Ponn. This year, 75 parents and 65 children were expected. 
Students' parents play an integral role in their children's life at school. Through its various subcommittees and activities, the Parent Support Committee is an essential part of the Center.

For example, through these subcommittees, family socials, workshops and field trips occur throughout the school year, as do a fall, winter, spring and international festival. 

All of these activities, as well as the instruction and attendance by the students, are expected to be significantly improved because of this grant.

Headline: Question Time: It's not funny unless you're drunk
Author: By HANS and JACKIE
&nbsp;
Q: Why do people say "when pigs fly"? I don't find that too unlikely. People should say "when elephants fly;" they're much heavier and less flighty.
Elephantitis

H: Piggies are a lot rosier and cuter than elephants; they're huggable and hoggable (if you can appreciate a pun); they are the cherubs of the animal kingdom. No wonder people long to see them fly. Winged elephants would be a menace to society.
J: Elephantitis, it must be awful to cope with such a disease and have no sayings about your fellow elephant men.  You'll just have to work hard to coin your own catchy phrase.

Q: What is the meaning of meaning? Why are we so obsessed with trying to find the meaning of life?
Samantha K.
H: I must admit I too was once on a quest to find "The Meaning of Life." I went to like three different Blockbuster stores, but "The Meaning of Life" was checked out and I had to settle for "Life of Brian." Whatever, I don't like Monty Python that much anyway.
J:  Because we are restless human beings who never seem to be content with our own lives. But if you find "the meaning of life," please forward it to me.

Q: When I go to parties, they tend to become insane orgies. What can I do to avoid this in the future? Should I just embrace the mayhem?
The Guru

H: Wear a nun outfit. This will deter the more degenerate characters in these parties and bring them to sobriety. Unless they're into nuns, in which case, good luck getting the stains out of the habit. 
 J:  Why not turn yourself into the Master of Ceremonies and give out prizes to the most hung guys and the most buoyant girls.  Then have a "Temptation Island" style orgy where the guys get to choose the girls they want and vice versa.  The losers get to go home to their mommies.  Eventually, "The Guru" will be a household name.   

Q: I joined a Buffy the Vampire Slayer message board and got into a heated discussion with Willow_and_Tara4Eva about who the next "Big Scooby Death" is going to be. I say Anya. She says Spike. What do you think?
Xander Van Rook 

H: I say Joss Whedon of auto-erotic asphyxiation.
J: Buffy is not on my priorty list, so if I had to pick and choose, I'd say Spike. Buffy can use a new man that really knows how to use his stake.

Headline: Arroyo hopeful that he will remain with Nuggets
Author: Marisabel Muñoz / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
For the first time since finishing his college career at FIU in 2001, former Golden Panther guard Carlos Arroyo returned to Miami as a professional basketball player and played in front of family and friends.

Arroyo played 24 minutes for the Denver Nuggets in a 101-76 loss to the Miami Heat at the American Airlines Arena on March 16. The Nuggets (21-48) are in the process of playing out the team's season.

Arroyo found out prior to the game he would be signed to a second 10-day contract, which makes it likely that the Nuggets will retain his services for the remainder of the season, although his contract expired on Wednesday.

"I'm very excited to get it," Arroyo said of the new contract. "Things are going real well for me right now. I've got to keep playing hard, not lose my focus and continue to run the team."

Nugget head coach Mike Evans, has been impressed by Arroyo's recent play.

"I hope he will be a part of our team in the future," Evans said. "He's going to be a nice little player down the road."

Arroyo will see more minutes this week. Teammate guard Tim Hardaway was ejected the day before in Orlando and was suspended for two games and fined $10,000 for throwing a television onto the court. That same night, Arroyo felt he convinced the Nuggets about keeping him.

"I [was] definitely happy with my performance, even more since it was against a real good team like the Magic. But I [was] more happy with the work I did in the first half [and before Hardaway was thrown out]," Arroyo said.

Arroyo had a total of 11 points, four rebounds and five assists in 27 minutes versus the Magic. He played 11 of those minutes alongside Hardaway.

Against the Heat, the Nuggets trailed the entire game. Arroyo, who replaced Voshon Leonard with 2:44 remaining in the first quarter, was in charge of creating more of an effective offense for the rest of the game.

The only player to score in the first 10 minutes of the game was Clabert Cheaney with six. It was not until Arroyo was subbed in that other Nuggets got to the basket. Among them was two setup plays to forward Juwan Howard.

"When he first came in, he fit in really good. I was pretty impressed for such a young guy making that transition," Howard said of Arroyo. "I admire him for it."

"He needs to play more and be in the right situation. The Toronto situation taught him a lot. He is confident. He is special."

The first four possessions with Arroyo on the court resulted in baskets, which cut the Heat's lead to 21-16. That would be the closest the Nuggets would get on the night. The Puerto Rico native was credited with just one assist on the stat sheet.

Arroyo returned to the NBA after one month in Spain, where he played for Tau Ceramica. He had previously played with the Toronto Raptors, who signed him as an undrafted rookie at the start of this season. The Raptors released Arroyo just before guaranteeing his contract.

Should Arroyo remain with Denver, he would become the second Golden Panther to stay on with an NBA team off two 10-day contracts. Raja Bell signed with the Philadelphia 76ers last season. 

Notes: Arroyo got his first start in the NBA March 18, when the Nuggets hosted the Detroit Pistons. Arroyo played 25 minutes, scoring six points and assisting eight, his NBA-career high.
