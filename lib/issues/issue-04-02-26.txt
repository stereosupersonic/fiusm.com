Headline: Staff struts its stuff
Subheadline: Talent Show brings out artistic side of faculty
Author: Cynthia M. Cortina/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
So you think you know your professors? Think again. FIU's faculty and staff, along with members of some school organizations, performed live in the first annual Faculty/Staff Talent Show in support of Dance Marathon 2004 this Monday.

  The variety show and auction is just one of the many productions taking place this year in order to promote Dance Marathon. This is a charity event affiliated with Miami Children's Hospital that raises money, through the Children's Miracle Network, for children in need of medical assistance. It is organized by FIU Campus Life, under the supervision of Manny Rosa, the assistant director.

  Hosted by Vice Presidents Patricia Telles-Irvin and Paul Gallagher, a series of nine acts and three commercials. 

  Performers ranged from singers and guitar players to belly dancers and models in a mini-fashion show. 

  James Webb, from the Physics Department and Walter Conklin, the IT Project Manager, both played guitar and sang original pieces that were comedic in nature and country and blues in style. Conklin's lively act, which won him second place, followed a solemn rendition of Sarah MacLachlan's "Angel" by Mai Lyn Calangelo from the Broward-Pines Center, which intensified the contrast among the routines.

  The belly dancers were Martha Castillo from University Technology Services and Concepcion Tuma from Career Services. Tuma was third runner up, and shocked the crowd by appearing with a full-lit chandelier on her head, while maintaining her balance and grace throughout her enthralling five-minute session of hip shaking and body swaying.

  A mini-fashion show exposing the "do's and don'ts" of proper business attire carried through with The Villiage People's "YMCA" song playing in the background.

  Charlie Andrews, director of Campus Life for Orientation and Commuter Services, graced the stage wearing a tight blazer and sandals with socks.

  He was a "don't."

  Others, like husband and wife Manny and Emily Menendez were "do's" as their blue shirts and dark suits complemented each other in an ideal combination of a flattering style and proper dress for the occasion.

  The Business Services divas, Kristia Greem, LeJeune March, and Tangela Wright sang an uplifting song with a positive message in its chorus, "in the morning, you'll be all right."

  Korrin Stanek of Housing and Residential Life serenaded the audience with her glorious voice and chic presence as she sang "Aria" a cappella. Her face transformed with each emotion, which contributed to evoking a strong sense of sentiment and passion within the audience. 

  She won first place in the contest.

  Judging, according to judge Christine Denton, was based on originality and dedication. 

  "We were looking for something that stood out and nothing that just anybody could do," she said. "Judging was based on how long it took to piece the performance, creativity, difficulty, and how the audience reacted to it."

  Justin Low, another member from Housing and Residential Life wrapped up the show with his humorous version of "I'll Be There." 

  His skit included on-the-spot costume changes and instant gender role switches that filled the room with laughter.

 The commercials were presented by Alumni Services, UTS, and Phi Mu.

  Alumni Services used the game show Jeopardy as its theme for a mock short question and answer mock session about FIU history. 

  UTS's commercial aimed at stressing the importance of password protection and created a parallel between this and underwear, claiming that both should not be shared and should be changed often, among other suggestions. 

  Phi Mu sang a cappella to the Toys R' Us theme song in order to spread awareness about charity.

  Campus Lifes Rosa said his vision for the future was to have an all-day event where lunch and dinner would be served and the Faculty/Staff Talent show would draw the night to a close. About $500 were raised during this event.

  Perhaps the most memorable moment of the night, was when the Miami Children's Hospital video was shown. 

  It exposed a young girl's miraculous story as she was close to death after being born prematurely and weighing a mere two pounds. A trained staff and advanced technology were able to save her life. 

  The Children's Miracle Network works with Dance Marathon in an effort to raise money for these funds. It is a nonprofit agency which started in 1983 as a small telethon in a television studio and today has raised more than $2.2 billion. Miami Children's Hospital has helped 180,000 patients through the charity and is still continuing to provide aid to those who need it.

  Dance Marathon raises $2 million annually for Penn State's Four Diamonds Fund, another charity. 

  At FIU, Dance Marathon has been active since 1997 and this will be the seventh year since its commencement.

  Since then, it has raised $200,000. This year the event will take place on April 3 and 4. Maria Garcia, Dance Marathon Director, claims that a series of events have been taking place since the past summer toward the cause of the effort, and that the Dance Marathon is a "culmination of everything."

   Participants include performers, moralers, volunteers, security guards, members of subcommittees and anyone can still apply up to the date of the event. Applications are available in Campus Life GC 340, in the Volunteer Action Center office.

Headline: Georgia scholarship program may fall victim to its own success
Author: Dahleen Glanton/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
ATLANTA - In the last decade, states have held up Georgia's HOPE scholarship as a model for funding education through the lottery. Now that its public colleges and universities are nearly bursting at the seams with more than 250,000 students, lawmakers fear the program could become a victim of its own success.

Though the Georgia Lottery is facing a record year with $1.33 billion in ticket sales during the last six months of 2003, $376 million of which will go to HOPE. Lawmakers are struggling to streamline the scholarship because of concerns that the program could run out of money within the decade.

One of the most heated battles in the Georgia General Assembly this year has been over preserving the HOPE scholarship, which has provided more than $2.5 billion to pay tuition and purchase books for some 750,000 students since the Georgia Lottery began operating in 1993.

For more than two decades, states have been using legalized gambling to help fill shrinking coffers. At least 41 states have lotteries that fund everything from senior citizen centers to prisons. 

But it has been the promise of better public education that has caught the interest of most voters. Still, when money for other programs dries up, lawmakers have been known to dip into education reserves.

While about two dozen states, including Illinois, New York, Michigan and Missouri, devote 100 percent of their proceeds to education, Georgia was among the first to include legislation that forbids lottery proceeds from going anywhere but to specific pre-kindergarten and post-secondary programs.

In Illinois, all lottery profits are required to go to the state's Common School Fund, which provided $540 million last year for K-12 public schools, or 3 percent of all government education funding. 

However, several states, including Illinois, have seen a drop in education funds in the last decade as lottery proceeds have declined.

"Supporters have been able to sell the lottery to voters with the idea that they will raise money and give students more opportunity for education. But you are gambling on education with gambling dollars, and that doesn't work," said Rodney Stanley, an assistant professor at the Institute of Government at Tennessee State University. 

"In Georgia, the requirements are so watered down that you end up giving scholarships to a lot of people who don't need them. But they're not increasing classroom size or increasing the number of instructors. The result is overcrowding."

HOPE, Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally offers full tuition to a state public college or university, as well as mandatory fees and an allowance for books, to high school students with a B average or higher.

While new lotteries under way in South Carolina and Tennessee, modeled after Georgia's, are expected to hurt lottery sales along Georgia's borders with those states, funding for HOPE has skyrocketed. 

That is largely because more students are becoming eligible for the scholarship, officials said.

While the HOPE scholarship has given more Georgians an opportunity to go to college, it has been a double-edged sword, according to educators. 

Crowding has become such as issue that many of the state's public colleges have had to raise admission standards, turn away students or place them on waiting lists, and move up application deadlines in an effort to relieve overcrowding.

The University of Georgia, the state's flagship university, plans to admit fewer freshmen this year and place others on a waiting list until May, a month after when students are normally notified of admission. 

Georgia State University, where freshman enrollment has soared in the last decade, moved its application deadline up by three months and raised its minimum SAT scores and GPA requirements.

On one side, Republicans, led by Gov. Sonny Perdue, want to toughen the requirements for obtaining and retaining the scholarships and also cut $125 million in payments for books and fees provided by the scholarship.

"We have a situation where lottery revenues are increasing but the rate of enrollment is getting to the point it could outpace revenue and bankrupt the program," said Perdue spokeswoman Loretta Lepore. 

"If there is no reform to HOPE, the program will run out of money in 2006 with a $141 million deficit."

Democrats, led by Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor, agree with tightening requirements but oppose the cuts. Taylor has proposed that scholarship recipients maintain a 3.0 grade point average and that their grades be evaluated more often, which could kick recipients off the scholarship quicker. 

"Instead of taking an ax to the program, I hope people will take a conservative approach and preserve it," he said. 

"If we begin cutting benefits, like books and fees, what is next? This kind of approach is like a tax increase on students or their parents."

Headline: College enrollment on the rise
Author: Maryaane Heorge/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Students enrolled in college hit a record high of 15 million last fall, and that number is expected to increase 10 percent in the next decade, according to a national study released Wednesday. 

But in Michigan, a struggling economy may be causing some students to rethink their college plans, say officials at Michigan State University and the University of Michigan. 

Across the country, applications have been increasing for the last four years at the nearly 600 colleges that were surveyed for the study by the National Association of College Admission Counseling, based in Alexandria, Va.

Preliminary data at U-M show applications for this fall are down 18 percent overall and down 23 percent among minorities. 

At MSU, applications to date are down 15 percent for both groups. A U.S. Supreme Court decision in June striking down U-M's point-based system that gave minorities a boost may be partly responsible for the lower numbers, school officials say. 

U-M has changed its application to require multiple essays, teacher recommendations and other data, making it more work for students. 

At MSU, students are now encouraged to write an essay. 

It will become mandatory in the fall of 2005. MSU is also becoming more competitive, discouraging some students from applying, said MSU admissions director Pam Horne. 

But an unemployment rate in Michigan of 7.2 percent, compared with 5.7 percent nationally, and a fear of layoffs may also be factors. 

"There is a lot of concern about cost," Horne said. "Tuition went up about 10 percent last fall at MSU, and the economy has not bounced back in Michigan like the rest of the nation. 

More students and families are considering community colleges for the first two years and then transferring to MSU." 

Parents who invested their college savings in the stock market are also not seeing the growth they expected, she said. 

Tuition, room and board at MSU for the 2003-04 academic year for in-state undergraduate students is about $11,000. 

At U-M, where in-state undergraduate tuition, room and board is about $14,600, admissions director Ted Spencer said he is hearing stories from parents who are nervous about committing to send their children to U-M because of the soft economy. 

"We are hearing parents talking about sending their students to a less-expensive school and seeing how things work out economically," Spencer said. "Even people with white-collar jobs are feeling threatened. There is anxiety out there in the marketplace." 

At Wayne State University, where many students commute to campus and can live at home, applications for the fall are up 30 percent overall and 47 percent for minorities, according to Jack Kay, WSU associate provost for assessment and retention.

The opening of two residence halls and stepped-up recruiting programs at area high schools and in the Latino community have helped boost the numbers, according to Kay.

Headline: Board of Trustees discusses medical school proposal
Author: Vanessa Gomez
&nbsp;
FIU's Board of Trustees disclosed advancements in the medical school proposal in a town hall meeting Feb. 20, where they also discussed building placement and funding.

The proposal was originally agreed upon by the university's Board of Trustees in November 2003. Since, the board has further researched and detailed the medical school initiative.

One of the main issues addressed at the meeting was funding.

The medical school will require approximately $30 million for operational costs and another $30 million for facilities in its first year, according to Tom Breslin, FIU's vice president for research. An extra $90 million is estimated for additional facilities beyond the initial stages.

Facilities will mostly be funded with Public Education Capital Outlay dollars, as well as money from private grants, which the state will match. 

Medical school faculty will be compensated from the state's Education and General funds. These are funds appropriated by the State Legislature to carry out and support the university's primary mission: education, research, and public service.

FIU will also receive financial help from the state annually. The University of Miami currently receives $15 million a year to fund its medical program. FIU is expecting its state medical funding to at least match that of UM's.

According to Breslin, FIU is not looking to diminish UM's state funding. On the contrary, "FIU wants a win/win for UM and FIU," Breslin said.

Building plans and locations are also being considered. 

The main medical building is tentatively scheduled for construction on the empty lot in the corner of Southwest 107 Avenue and Tamiami Trail.

As stated in the proposal, FIU's medical school seeks to ultimately increase the number of minority physicians serving South Florida, in order to make the number of physicians more proportional to the multi-ethnic community. 

The medical school will also provide an affordable and accessible medical education, to use in partnership with local hospitals and clinics.

Clayton Solomon, University Park Student Government Council president and Board of Governor's student member, believes that the addition of a medical school would bring FIU to a different level. 

"Just like a law school, or a football team, a medical school will bring prestige to FIU," said Solomon.

The medical school is part of FIU's more comprehensive Health and Medical Education Initiative. According to the original proposal the initiative will integrate, several educational programs already being offered at the university as well as stimulate bio-medical research to address the South Florida's healthcare needs. 

"The medical school will be complimenting other programs with an already strong base," said Breslin, referring to the existing biomedical engineering, chemistry, and nursing programs, among others. Currently, there are four conventional medical schools in Florida: University of Miami, University of Florida, University of South Florida, and Florida State University. 

The proposed FIU program will be the only public education MD program in South Florida and the fifth conventional medical degree program in the State. 

Breslin is confident an medical school will be the right move. "[FIU] has the wealth and talent to proceed with a medical school," he said.

FIU's medical school initiative still needs to be revised and approved by the Florida Board of Governors before the university can act.

Headline: "Gay" Marriage Is Not A Civil Rights Issue
Subheadline:  
Author: thedrdrew@netzero.com
&nbsp;
Today's biggest oxymoron: "Gay" marriage---and the largest attack on morality and most notable attack on the Constitution to date. Marriage is a clearly defined institution and legal status that has been around since before the founding of this nation. Whether or not you agree with homosexuality, there can be no mistake that this is an attack on the already vulnerable and weakened institution known for thousands of years as "marriage." First of all, calling it "gay" marriage is an automatic acknowlegement that marriage itself is defined as between a man and a woman. Otherwise it would be called "heterosexual" or "normal" marriage. This gives a small minority of people the power to subvert the will of the people. The majority of Americans recognize marriage for what it is and for its true purpose: to raise a family. Most Americans disagree with homosexuality but have no problem with its existence. Allowing gay marriage is forcing the majority to accept something they do not agree with. It is equivalent to a group of atheists forcing the word "G-d" out of public institutions because they are offended by that word.

And, lets face it, gay marriage is not a civil rights issue. A small minority of people want to make it a civil rights issue--but it is not. It is changing the definition of a word for a small number of people who cannot accept their own limitations.

Marriage is between a man and a woman--and that is the way it is.

Subheadline: 3rd-ranked Miami Hurricanes to visit University Park in cross-county showdown next
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Feb.21 - FIU 11, FAMU 5The Golden Panthers headed to Tallahassee looking for revenge, and got what they wanted in an 11-5 win over Florida A&M on Feb. 21."Since we started off rough with FAMU in the beginning of our season, we tried to look at this series as a fresh start," said freshman catcher Cody Jacobs.Junior Derek DeCarlo (1-2) made his first start of the 2004 season, pitching five innings and striking out five. DeCarlo had been working out of the bullpen since injuring his hip last season."Starting is so different then closing," said DeCarlo, "It felt real good out there."Denny Hernandez relieved DeCarlo and pitched three innings. He allowed only one hit and struck out two batters.  Junior Leo Calderon hit the mound in the ninth and threw an impressive scoreless inning to secure the FIU win.Despite an early Rattler lead, FIU fought back and turned the game around. Trailing 3-0 in the fourth inning, freshman Cody Jacobs hit a two-run homer to cut the FAMU lead to one. Jacobs battled to a 3-2 count and fouled off three consecutive pitches before connecting on the long ball."I was just really trying to get a hit," said Jacobs.FIU trailed 5-2 entering the ninth, but the Golden Panthers took advantage of numerous FAMU errors and put nine runs on the board.Jacobs, who had two RBI and scored three runs, replaced a sick Adrian Casanova in the starting lineup and didn't find out until just before game time."I wasn't even supposed to play the first game," said Jacobs, "I just tried my best."  Dennis Diaz and P.J. Lehmann combined forces, getting two hits each, to go along with eight other FIU batters who recorded hits.Feb. 21 - FIU 13, FAMU 0 (7 Innings)Hitting the field for their second game of the day in a doubleheader, the Golden Panthers once again "paid back" the Rattlers with a no-hitter and a 13-0 blowout victory. "I think we made a lot of progress as a team in this game," DeCarlo said.The Golden Panthers were utterly on top of their game Saturday afternoon. Eight of the team's nine starters recorded a hit, along with Luis Rivera, who was three for five and had two runs. Designated hitter Mario Suarez went two for three and had two RBI and scored three runs.Mark Worrell (1-3) and Frank Gonzalez combined for a no-hitter through seven innings, where the game was called.FIU scored three runs in the first, sixth and seventh innings.He also stole six bases, while Dennis Diaz swiped a season-high three bags.Feb. 22 - FIU 6, FAMU 3FIU completed its series sweep against the Rattlers on Sunday, winning 6-3 and improving its record to 4-7.  The Golden Panthers came back into the limelight and won four straight games from FAMU, who seized the first two games of a three-game series in Miami earlier this month.  "I think we started to realize that we needed to end our losing streak," said DeCarlo.Starter Andrew Edwards pitched four innings, striking out six and allowed only four hits and three FAMU runs. Golden Panther reliever Danny Hernandez (1-0) got the win for FIU, pitching 3.1 innings and holding the Rattlers to only three hits.FIU took a 2-0 lead in the second, after Mario Suarez hit a double and later scored off Cody Jacob's single up the middle. Jacobs was able to reach third on a wild pitch and then headed to home plate on Eric Otero's grounder to second.Jacobs improved his average to .417 for the weekend. He also went five for 12 producing five runs and two doubles."I am very excited because I was just trying to get in some playing time," said Jacobs.FAMU's Stanley Gnat hit a solo homer in the second, cutting the FIU lead to 2-1. In the fifth, the Rattlers took the lead, 3-2, on a Chris Lee RBI single. FIU tied up the game on pinch hitter Yahmed Yema's sacrifice fly, which scored Jacobs, making the score 3-3. Diaz stepped up to the plate in the seventh and regained the lead for the Golden Panthers. He walked, then stole second and third only to score on a Rattler throwing error by second baseman Nick Parker, making the score 4-3. FIU added two more in the eighth, capped by a Yema RBI triple, to preserve the win.The Golden Panthers next host the University of Miami on Feb. 26. FIU has not beaten the Hurricanes since a 9-7 victory at University Park on May 2, 2002.Miami won the last meeting, 6-4, on April 16, 2003 at University Park.

Headline: Sun Belt blues finally over
Subheadline: Men's basketball picks up first conference win since 2003 season
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After 15 straight conference losses, FIU finally picked up its first Sun Belt victory of the season, and its first home conference win in over two years. The Golden Panthers defeated New Orleans, 63-58, Saturday night at the Golden Panther Arena.FIU took the lead 54-53 after a Carlos Morban jumper with 1:21 remaining in the game. New Orleans guard Johnell Smith then missed a jumper that would have given the Privateers the lead with just under a minute to go, but was fouled. He hit one of two shots, tying the game at 54.FIU had a chance to tie, but Morban missed a jumper as regulation ended, sending the Golden Panthers to overtime for the first time since a loss to North Texas on Jan. 5, 2003With 3:06 to go in OT, Smith hit a three-point basket, giving the Privateers a 58-55 lead, but that was the last time UNO would score. Raphael daSilva got fouled on the following play, drawing FIU to within one point at 58-57 with two minutes to go. Belco Bamba followed with a steal at half court and passed it down court to Morban for a layup. Guard Marcus Robinson and Warren Gale scored the final four points for FIU.It was a much needed victory for head coach Donnie Marsh whose job might be in jeopardy after this season."I told the guys this game was about heart. It wasn't about the X's and O's or all that other stuff, cause these kids have been through a lot this past week - on things that have been said about them and us. But they earned this one and they know now what exactly it takes for a win," said Marsh.The Golden Panthers trailed the entire second half until Morban hit a three-point basket with 6:22 left in regulation, which gave FIU a 46-45 lead.Marsh used a limited lineup through much of the second half and overtime, keeping starters Byron Burnett and Gabriel Lazo on the bench and giving Bamba and Gale extra playing time."We played seven guys down the stretch in the second half, in which three played the entire half and that's all about heart, commitment and dedication - something people questioned whether they had that or not," Marsh said.Both teams shot 10 for 23 (43.5 percent) in the first half. FIU led by as many as five points, but UNO capitalized on a series of FIU turnovers and overtook the lead 24-23 entering halftime.The game ultimately came down to free throws. Both teams made 10 field goals in the first half, 12 in the second half and two in overtime. The difference was that FIU made five of six free throws in overtime while UNO did not visit the stripe at all.Despite already being eliminated from postseason contention entering the game, finally getting a conference win was big for FIU."It was huge for us. We didn't want to go the whole year without winning one. This was big for our kids confidence-wise so they now know they can close out a league opponent, and a very good one," said Marsh of UNO who came into the game 14-11 and 8-4 in SBC play.FIU, who had lost 19 of its previous 23 games, finally was able to close out a tight game when it mattered most."We played together, we played hard and beat a good team. We had been playing well the past few games but today we wanted to win more than they did," said Lazo, who finished the game with five rebounds.Robinson, who played a team-high 42 minutes in the game, couldn't hide his excitement after the victory."The victory was huge! This is our first conference win and it was our biggest win of the season. The defense was our key to winning this game," Robinson said.And it seemed like the first time this season that there were faces of happiness in the locker room."Everything is going in the right direction now. Everyone was so happy from the coaches, my teammates and myself. Coach said how everyone played with heart and the confidence we had in ourselves," said Bamba, who is playing his final season here at FIU.DaSilva led the Golden Panthers with a career-high 21 points on 8 of 11 shooting, and Morban chipped in with 18 points."[DaSilva] plays with a great deal of energy even though sometimes he tends to get out of the stuff we want to do. But with him, you have to live with it a little bit - as long as it doesn't get away from our game plan. Tonight he stayed with it, and for the most part he played with so much energy that I think it helped the rest of the guys on the floor," Marsh said.DaSilva credited his motivation to his coach."I just wanted that for tonight's game. I told the guys we should get the victory for coach Marsh for everything he has been going through," daSilva said.After the game, Marsh gathered up his players and told them he noticed the extra effort."He told us we should be tired right now because when you give it all you got with heart, that's what happens and you come out with a W," added daSilva.UNO, ranked second in the Sun Belt Conference, was led by Bo McCalebb who finished with 21 points. UNO had its four-game winning streak snapped.FIU had not won a Sun Belt Conference game at home since defeating this same team on Jan. 26, 2002.  FIU had not defeated a SBC team since a Feb. 13, 2003, 56-46 win over South Alabama. With the win, FIU improved its record to 5-19 and 1-10 in the Sun Belt Conference.

Headline: Homosexuals should be given their earned, equal rights
Author: Miguel Quintero/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The problem:  Should gays and lesbians be allowed to marry and enjoy the same benefits as straight married men and women?I will hint at the answer by posing several questions. Are gay individuals less human than straight individuals? Are gay Americans less American than straight Americans?  Should minority parties deal with and learn to live by the rules and beliefs of majority parties?  Where is the line drawn? Where are Americans willing to compromise their freedom for equality over their freedom for order and tradition or their comfort levels?  In other words, what price are Americans willing to pay for the breach of their freedom on some other issue of similar circumstance - in largely, their freedom to choose?In studying American history. we learn individuals have the opportunity to learn about the pattern of policy delegation and deliberation regarding civil liberties and civil rights. They learn the pattern that brought forth the development of these rights - the sacrifices made, the lives lost, the education of the public. Individuals learn the relevance of civil liberties and civil rights and how these rights encompass the essences of "the pursuit of happiness," proclaimed inalienable rights by the founders of the Constitution of the United States. Civil liberties and civil rights are two incentive-based practices that make up most of what is all-American political ideology.  And it seems now that these rights do not apply to gay Americans - as they once did not apply to black Americans or to women in America.Homosexuals are a minority group.  One particularly beautiful aspect of American government is the protection of minority groups - the understanding that men and women are different and choose to live differently. This protection allows minority groups to live in their differences, an American value that has been respected in whole, until this day. The founding fathers did not largely promote majoritarian ideologies, but rather, pluralistic ideologies. So why then are minority groups like African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, American women, etc. given the right to pursue happiness with their differences and not homosexual Americans?Just like how the minority groups mentioned above struggled (some more than others) to educate the public and persuade policy makers to implement laws protecting their particular group, so have gay Americans.  It's time they are given the rights they're entitled to as human beings.It's apparent this issue of gay rights is being distorted by religious standpoints being presented as moral standpoints. The issue of minority rights is a moral issue based on freedom and justice, not a religious issue. As Americans educate themselves, they learn the importance as well as the incentives for the freedom of choice.There is a separation between church and state; gay rights must be recognized, debated, and delivered. It is unconstitutional to prevent and ignore these rights. If any individual restricts the rights of any other individual, then one day his rights will also be limited. It's justice, karma, god's will; whatever it's called - it's inevitable - individuals will be judged for their actions, or lack thereof.

Headline: Wales' answer to Pink Floyd? Not quite, says Super Furry Animals
Author: Chuck Myers/Knight Ridder Tribune News Service
&nbsp;
The progressive rock group Super Furry Animals isn't afraid to let the fur fly when making music on or off stage.

Formed in 1993, the five bandmates from Wales, Britain Gruff Rhys (guitar and vocals), Guto Pryce (bass), Cian Ciaran (keyboards), Huw Bunford (guitar), and Dafydd Leuan (drums) made their mark during the late 1990s with techno-powered rhythms with rock melodies.

While the band has stayed true to its desire to experiment musically, it has remained doggedly determined from the start not to allow its Welsh identity to get sucked into the vortex of prevailing trends.

"When we started, the Brit Pop thing was happening in Britain," Pryce said. "And it was all about where you were from and flying the flag. We were trying to push away from that. We listen to bands' music from all over the world."

The integration of varied musical styles and a dynamic live show has led some observers to draw comparisons between Super Furry Animals and Pink Floyd.

"It's funny, we get compared to Pink Floyd a lot," Pryce said. "And we honestly don't listen to Pink Floyd ... Maybe if we listen to Pink Floyd, it would get serious."

The band has never shied away from expressing heartfelt views through its music, even if they might run contrary to political or cultural correctness.

The Super Furry Animals have a knack for coming up with the unexpected. The group's latest effort, 2003's Phantom Power (Sony), combines somber lyrical hues with upbeat sonic potency.

Phantom Power is probably the most stripped down record, apart from Mwng, Pryce said. "In the past, we've layered and layered stuff maybe to hide things. But we still end up with a lot of layers, a lot of instrumentations. ... Certainly, it still doesn't mean we won't go off on tangents. So, we're weary of being like an imitation of a band. We chuck it all in, and change it all the time."	

Shortly before Iceland's Sigur Rs hit it big with its Icelandic-language based music, Super Furry Animals produced a mother-tongue album of its own in 2000, Mwng (pronounced "mung").

Pryce remembers that when the album came out, the group was uncertain how critics and the public would react to it.

"We were certainly surprised by how well it was received," Pryce recalls. "We were expecting a little bit of flack for it, especially in the [United Kingdom]."

Although proud of its Welsh heritage, Pryce said the band doesn't dwell on it. 

"We like to celebrate some things from where we come ... But we don't push everything Welsh. We used Howard Max who was a marijuana smuggler. He was like an anti-hero. And he was like a new kind of Welsh hero. And that's why we pushed him as opposed to the old Tom Jones sort of hero. So, we are proud of where we come."

Headline: Forum to provide insight about Cabaret
Author: Adriana Deben/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The production of "Cabaret" is coming soon to FIU, and in preparation, the theatre department will be hosting a forum March 1 at 8 p.m. on author Christopher Isherwood, whose book, "The Berlin Stories," served as the inspiration for the musical.

Professor Barbara Weitz, director of the Film Studies Certificate Program, will host the event and all students planning on attending Cabaret should not miss this forum. Weitz said students will "learn a little bit about history, a little bit about film, a little bit about theatre, and a whole lot about human nature and the ways of the world."

The forum will delve into issues such as social deviance by describing what life was like in Berlin during the 1930s. 

Students will gain insight into some of the most decadent Berlin night clubs and the various characters who attended them. The forum will include clips from two films made from "The Berlin Stories," as well as stills of the real Sally Bowles. There will also be readings from the original play adapted from Isherwood's book.

Weitz, who also teaches the course Literature and Film, believes that "Cabaret" is the ultimate adaptation. "The novel has intrigued several generations of readers, theatre and movie audiences. It offers skillfully drawn portraits of a group of characters caught up in a moment of history," Weitz said.

The forum will be interactive. Students are encouraged to participate and ask questions along the way. Student, Lina Roitman, 23, said "the idea that Cabaret is coming soon to FIU is amazing and the fact that I can attend a forum to gain some insight will be a great experience."

Student Angie Millis, 22, said "I think Cabaret relates in a big way to people from all generations. It will be fun to see how the issues that young people faced in Berlin during the 1930s are similar to issues we face today."

The forum will be held at FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus library, room 175. Admission is free and the event is open to the public.

Headline: Collegiate theatre career proves challenging for Zeller
Author: Heather Brummer/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Ah, the life of a theatre major: Publicity, recognition, work, work, more work, huh?

That's right. Being a theatre major is not an easy job. Theatre students do not attend their classes in between days at the spa and they don't demand extra space in which to park their Mercedes. 

"Excuse me, I'm a theatre major," is not a valid excuse for jumping the line at Publix, and the closest they get to autograph requests is the signature line on class registration forms. 

Contrary to popular belief, the life of a theatre major is not all fun and games. The work can be trying and the days long.

Just ask Carolyn Zeller, who is currently starring in this season's "Cabaret," which opens March 4 at University Park's Wertheim Performing Arts Center. Zeller portrays the show's female lead, Sally Bowles, a young woman who has run away from home to become a nightclub singer at the Kit Kat Club. The club's sizzling atmosphere serves as a contrast to the outside world, set in 1930s Berlin, where the Nazi party is gaining power. 

The show's master of ceremonies puts it best during his welcoming song: "Outside it is winter, but in here it is so hot that every night we have to battle to keep the girls from taking off all their clothing."

"Hot" is an adjective that Zeller can identify with these days; with just a few weeks until opening night, the heat is on the entire cast to put the finishing touches on the show.

This won't be easy for Zeller, who already carries a full schedule. Her week is filled by five classes, a lab, and nightly rehearsals, which average at least three hours each. And, as incredulous as it may sound, Zeller is not isolated in her lifestyle.

Most students in the theatre department balance full class schedules, work loads, and rehearsals when necessary. In fact, people are often surprised by just how much work it takes to major in theatre. This may be due in part to the common misconception that students take only acting classes to get their degree. However, nothing could be further from the truth. A quick glance at the curriculum will show any skeptics out there that, although the program may focus on performance, there are also history, literature, and technical classes to be taken. 

A typical play requires nightly rehearsals and for those who assume that not performing in a show will reduce the amount of time they have to put in, that's not the case. Those who are not cast are still required to participate in productions backstage, constructing the set or costumes, or working on a run crew. 

And there's no room for egoism in the theatre department: After a show's final performance, everyone, including actors, attends "strike," where the set is taken apart and recycled for future productions. 

The reality of a theatre major's lifestyle is usually concealed because audiences only see the glamorous finished product, which is supposed to look effortless. Only those who are in the program know the amount of work which is required for performances and every day life. 

That being said, most would agree that it's a necessary evil and the satisfaction felt makes up for the effort put in. Say what you want, but when it comes to the life of a theatre major, one phrase holds true: "Never a dull moment."
