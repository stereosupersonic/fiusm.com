Headline: University heightens campus security
Author: Tony Metzelar/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Bearing in mind the heightened state of homeland security, the Department of Public Safety encourages the university community to be extra alert on and off campus and notify the police of any suspicious activities. 

    "Be aware of your surroundings," said Lieutenant Al Ianiello.  "If you see anything suspicious, call the police department.  If you see a garbage can not where it should be, or a purse or box left somewhere without an owner, let us know and we'll immediately investigate it.  It's not always the obvious.  Don't put yourself in danger, stay at a safe distance and let us judge what's in it."

     According to the official website of the Department of Public Safety, the United States is at an orange threat level, which is declared by the government when there is a high risk of terrorist attacks. 

In response to the threat level, the University has also heightened its security measures, according to a memo sent out by President Modesto Maidique. 

The new security measures include increased public safety presence and patrols on campus, locking of building doors throughout campus where appropriate and enhancement of security overall.  

The decision to increase security came after a meeting of the Emergency Management Core Committee. The committee met to review procedures that would ensure the safety of students, faculty and staff in the event of an emergency on campus.

     Lieutenant Frank Tomassini of Biscayne Bay Campus Public Safety said that should there be an emergency on campus, Public Safety would use the fire alarm system to evacuate the building.

"An emergency could mean a fire, gas leak, bomb threat or anything that requires an immediate evacuation by the students," Tomassini said. "For this reason, there is a zero tolerance on evacuation upon the sound of the alarm." 

Zero tolerance means that everyone is to evacuate immediately, without hesitation and without questions, at the sound of the bell.

     "In terms of security, because of the current state of national security and war, Public Safety is being much more vigilant, careful and aware of anything that doesn't look proper," Tomassini said. "It's the nature of Law Enforcement to always be on an [elevated] threat level, anyway."

     He said that Public Safety trains every year for emergency situations, such as hurricanes or terrorist attacks, and they make sure that every policy and procedure is in place.  But this year that annual training was done ahead of schedule. 

If an emergency should occur on campus, the campus community would be notified through the web, the FIU help line (305-348-4357), email and voice mail.

     However, many students don't feel very worried that a dangerous incident could take place on campus.  

"I don't go around thinking about it," Lyanet Dela Cotera, a sophomore and student assistant at BBC Campus Life, said.  "I have to go on with my life.  I'm not terrified [about a terrorist attack on campus].  If I hear something [suspicious] was found from other people, I will report it, but it doesn't worry me too much."



"I am sure it is on the back of everyone's mind," Roxanne Lalla-Maharah, senior, finance and marketing, said.  "But people tend to get over things, [even if they are] as bad as 9/11, and after a while they just carry on with their everyday lives."

     Even in the FIU mail department, the tension and concern about anthrax or any other harmful substance in the mail is all but forgotten.  Nate Lockhart, who is a clerk at the BBC mailroom, said that there were two incidents of possible anthrax in the mail that frightened him.

Lockhart handles letters, and when powder appeared in two envelopes in the fall of 2001, he immediately called Public Safety.  He heard of people dying in the news from such contents in letters during that time, and for three months would not work without having gloves on.

But even Lockhart hasn't worn gloves or worried about what strange letters he would have to handle in a long time.

"There hasn't been anything peculiar found in the mail system for a good while," Lockhart said.

Paul Mullen, professor of political science at University Park, said that it is of great importance to be aware of unusual or unexpected behavior from individuals and to be alert for suspicious packages.  He also said it is important to remember that not all terrorist attacks are the same.

"As historians point out, 'people plan for the last war' [or the last terrorist attack in this case], and miss the upcoming event," Mullen said.  "It is natural to prepare for the same attack that was done to us before, however, the next attack may be completely different." 

 	In the memo, Maidique said FIU has not received or been alerted to any specific threat on any campus. He encourages students, faculty and staff to "go about their normal business, but report any suspicious behavior or circumstances to Public Safety immediately. 

The Department of Public Safety's website, which was created by the Environmental & Health Safety Department, explains which exits to take in case of mandatory evacuation in each of the campuses (UP, BBC, CEAS, Wolfsonian), Tomassini said.  He encourages everyone to go to the site, and says there are many other safety precautions on it that are important to know.  For example, wherever you are, be aware of your surroundings.  The very nature of terrorism suggests there may be little or no warning.

Headline: Professor's book read on radio show
Author: Geannina Munizaga/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The nationally syndicated radio program "The Radio Reader" is honoring Les Standiford, professor and director of the Creative Writing Department at FIU Biscayne Bay Campus, by featuring his latest literary work on-air through the month of March.

Standiford is excited to hear his work on the air, especially on a program such as "The Radio Reader," he said.

"I was thrilled [when I found out from my publisher]," Standiford said. "I'm honored to be placed among such great works that are [constantly] read on the program."

Host and narrator of "The Radio Reader," Dick Estell, known as the "consummate radio voice" to his listeners, will read the work, entitled "Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean," in its entirety from March 7 - April 1. The program, which is heard on 100 public radio stations throughout the nation, is heard in South Florida on WLRN-91.3 FM Monday through Friday, from 10 -10:30 a.m.  

Standiford's book was published last fall by Crown Publishers and is now in its fourth printing. It has been a Southeastern Booksellers Association bestseller and a Book Sense 76 Pick. The History Channel and Book Sense recently named the work one of the Top Ten History Picks for Spring 2003.

The professor said he is grateful for such an honor, and is thankful he has been successful as a writer.

"I never dreamed I would be able to make a living as a writer," Standiford said. "It's been the perfect life. I feel very fortunate." 

His book is a non-fiction account of the construction and demise of the 1904 Key West Railroad, which connected the island to the mainland, crossing 153 miles of open ocean. The railroad was all but destroyed by a hurricane three decades later, in 1935. 

According to Standiford, the idea for the book came when he realized that the story of Henry Flagler wasn't really well known outside of South Florida, or in it, for that matter. Flagler was an entrepreneur born in New York in the early 1800s who, in his lifetime, owned a salt grain mine, partnered up with Rockefeller to form Standard Oil, built hotels across Florida and constructed the railroad system for customers to access the hotels. Before Henry Flagler, Fort Lauderdale, Daytona, West Palm Beach and even Miami did not exist, Standiford said. 

"No one really knows who Flagler was - that he was a partner of John D. Rockefeller and a co-founder of Standard Oil," Standiford said.  "Flagler single-handedly created the state of Florida, as we know it."

Professor Standiford also admires Flagler's entrepreneurship and devotion to Florida. 

"He created the 'impossible railroad', it was like building a rocket ship to reach the moon," Standiford said. "[Flagler] did what people said was impossible."

The professor has early memories of interest in writing, even though he received a BA in psychology and attended law school before he began his graduate studies.

"I wanted to read novels, not look through psychological journals," said Standiford. "I talked my way into a creative writing class at Ohio State as a refuge...and was told teaching could be an option."

Standiford then went on to receive his masters and doctorate degrees in creative writing at the University of Utah.

The professor's newest work, a mystery novel titled "Havana Run," is set partly in Key West and partly in Cuba and will be published this May. The book is based on Standiford's personal travel to both locations, weaving the elements of mystery into his experiences.

Standiford believes "success in writing is 25 percent talent, 25 percent hard work, 25 percent persistence and 25 percent luck" and the best way to become a skillful writer is to read and write abundantly.

"I tell all my students that writing is a performing art, just like music or acting," Standiford said. "Many are called, but few are chosen."

Headline: Students, staff remember professor
Subheadline: Deceased professor to be honored at Communications Week
Author: Sarah Rodriguez/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
	"There is always that one professor who believes more in his students than they believe in themselves; that was Professor [Bill] Adams."
Lily Gomez, public relations major, class of 2002.

	Barbara Adams found a thick leather journal that had been given to Bill once as a gift; she asked him if he wanted to keep it.  Bill was a busy person, and didn't have much time to write out his plans in a book, he would simply set out and do them.  He told Barbara to sell it in the garage sale they were having.  In it, Bill's daughter-in-law--who thought she could make good use of the journal--found a page that Bill had filled out.  There was a question that read something like, "if you were struck by lightning today, how would you want to be remembered?"  Bill's closest friend read his answer on March 16 at Bill's private memorial service.  Bill had written: 
"That I was an enjoyable, fun and eclectic person to know.  That I was caring and considerate to others and that I was professional at what I did.  I'd want them to have approved of my ethical standards, and have them think I added something to the world I left, and that I would be missed."

	On March 13, FIU lost an admired and beloved professor, mentor, and friend.  William Carryl Adams, one of the nation's most respected public relations experts and an associate professor of public relations and advertising at FIU died of Coronary Heart Disease.  At 62, Adams is no longer with the many people who loved him, but has left behind a legacy that will not soon be forgotten.

	He is internationally known for his expertise in the public relations field.  He spent 25 years of his life holding managerial and directorial public relations positions for large corporations such as Standard Oil Company.  At Phillips Petroleum Company he was responsible for the creation of an award-winning program in which he and his colleagues spoke to communications students at over 100 college campuses worldwide.  

	He was a long-time active member of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) and lectured yearly in the Master of Public Relations program at the Universita Della Svizzera Italiano in Lugano, Switzerland.  He also did consulting for the Belize Tourism Council and wrote a column called "Ask the Professor," for Public Relations Tactics.
	
	The news of the professor's sudden death came as a painful surprise to his students and colleagues, many of whom found out days later because of the spring break. 

	"I was really shocked," said Sebastian Aroca '03, a communications major.  "He's one of the greatest teachers I've ever had."

	
	According to Barbara Adams, his wife of 35 years, he had undergone a series of physical health tests just before his death and the results had indicated that he was in perfect health.  In fact, the doctor had told Adams that "he had the heart of a young runner and could run forever."

	Adams died in their Plantation home after going out for a jog.  When Barbara asked him how the jog went, he replied happily, "it's absolutely spectacular, I could have run forever."

	Adams's family held a private ceremony in honor of him last Sunday.  He was a devoted father to three grown sons, Douglas, Erik and Kristofer   

Though mourning the death of her closest friend, Mrs. Adams's pain has been soothed by a joyous occasion--the birth of another grandson.  Collin William was born March 17, only a few days after Adams passed away.  

	"He was going to be [named] Collin Kristofer until Thursday," Mrs Adams said.

Mrs. Adams has two other grandchildren, Tyler and Kaitlyn. 
	
Adams has been recognized locally and nationally for his excellence as an educator.  In 2000, he was the recipient of FIU's Teaching Excellence Award and named Adviser of the Year by the FIU chapter of the Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA).  The same year the PRSA named him Outstanding Public Relations Educator, and he was voted one of the "Top Ten Public Relations Educators in the U.S.," by PR Week Magazine.

	According to the spring 2001 edition of FIU magazine, he began his teaching career because he believed it was essential for those with corporate experience to pass their knowledge on to persons new to the field.

	"I really wanted the psychic reward that comes with giving back," said Adams.  "Giving back what you've learned to do to those just entering the field is something that I feel more people in corporate and nonprofit life should be doing."

	Many of Adams's students saw him as more of a father figure than a professor.  To him, students weren't simply students, they were his children.  One of the first things that Barbara said about her husband was that Bill had three kids of his own and that he had another set of kids--his students.

	"He felt like and treated them [students] like he was their father," she said.  "He was so proud every time they would do great on a test, when they got out of school and came up with this wonderful idea for a job, or had a great interview."

	One student remembers the look of pride on Adams's face when he saw her at her commencement ceremony.  

	"My last memory of him is going down the line to greet my professors ... and being so excited to see him there," said Alicia M. Palma, who graduated a communications major in 2002.  "When I reached him, we hugged and he told me how proud he was.  That meant more than he could have imagined because I'd learned so much from his dedication not only to the profession but also to his students."

	Patricia Rose, professor and chair of the department of advertising and PR noted fondly the parental relationship that Bill had with his students.

	"Bill absolutely loved his students, they were his kids, and I mean with a K I D S," she said.  "His whole idea of being at the university was to teach, to interact with students, to mentor them.  


	Adams showed genuine concern for his students in and out of the classroom, keeping track of their progress and acting as a motivating force if he felt they weren't working to their capabilities.  According to many of his students, he was a very interactive and personal teacher who would approach anybody who missed class.  

	"Bill didn't think anybody in the world would want to miss his class," joked Pat Rose.  "He was sure if anybody missed his class, that person must be sick.  He would call them to find out why they weren't there."


	Adams always made certain to put forth his best efforts in order to create a motivating and stimulating learning environment for his students both inside and outside of the classroom.

	His willingness to aid his students in successfully pursuing their career goals was one of his most admired qualities.  He was always more than willing to lend a helping hand to those who needed it.
	
	"He helped me get an internship, critiqued my resume," said Christina Armand, a student of Adams and Vice President of the PRSSA.  "If I ever needed a recommendation, all I had to do was ask and he would have it for me the next day.  He was always helping with whatever you needed.  

After having worked for so long in the corporate world, he had developed a multitude of contacts, which he used to help his students achieve more.

	"One of the things they [students] admire most about him [is that] he always had deep contacts in the community," said Ahles.  "I'm talking big dollars for big projects.  He would always get the big CEO to come here for nothing and talk."

	Throughout his 13 years at FIU, Adams helped push forward important projects to aid in the development of the SJMC.  He secured $20,000 in funding for the PRSSA project, "A Student's Guide to Public Relations Education," which has been distributed at colleges and universities nationwide.  He also made numerous publicity efforts on behalf of the SJMC.

 	One of Adam's most helpful and remembered contributions to the students was his securing of over $350,000 in corporate grants to assist the PRSSA in creating Get Ready: Hurricane Preparedness Guide, which is now in its 10th year of publication.

	"[The guide] is a project that Bill conceptualized," noted Ahles.  "The remarkable thing is that he was able to perpetuate that funding year after year.  I remember getting a copy before I went to work for FIU.  It touched me even before I was a faculty member.

The most recent project Adams had undertaken for his students was Communications Week, a weeklong event that he began working on last November.  He helped line up for the event an impressive group of speakers including Marylin Laurie, former Senior Vice President of Communications at AT&T, Gail DeGeorge of the Sun-Sentinel, and Jane Bussey of the Miami Herald.

Communications week will kick off at 5:30 p.m. April 7 in the Wolfe University Center Ballroom with a keynote address by National CNN correspondent/investigative reporter, Brooks Jackson.

Sometime during that same week, a "Celebration of Life Service," is planned to honor Adams's memory.  Details have not yet been announced  

"Basically, Barbara [his wife] wants something that's upbeat and fun," said Pat Rose of the upcoming memorial service.  "Her comment was that Bill would not come in spirit to anything that is sad."

	One of Adams's marked characteristics was his sense of humor.  For those who knew him, being in his presence meant constantly having a smile on your face.  He was known for handing out "stress-busters," a.k.a Jolly Ranchers candies to his students and writing witty comments in the margins of their papers.

	Kate Caylor, Adams's secretary of three years called Adams a "bonafide gentleman" and cannot forget him frequently bringing donuts to the office and flowers to her at the beginning of each semester.
	She laughed when she remembered Adams calling her Thumbelina after she had broken her thumb.  
	Caylor also recalled when Adams encouraged her to participate in the "Turkey Trot" jogging race held yearly during Thanksgiving.
	
	"He was a jogger and I'm not.  I have bad knees and he encouraged me to get out there and run around the campus to get a free turkey," she said with laughter.  "He zoomed by me three or four times and I came in last, but he made sure that I got a turkey.  I'm limping along trying to hold onto my cast and he's waiting for me with a little finish line that he made with a towel, and I made it through.  He made life fun."

	For Pat Rose, a fond memory of Bill is him making her coffee every morning.

	"Bill was convinced that I could do nothing domestically," she laughed.  "So, he made my coffee everyday because he knew that I probably wouldn't make it myself."

	The contributions that Adams has made to the School of Journalism and Mass Communications and his students are countless.  Ahles noted that he brought an intangible asset to the school--wisdom.

	"He had been through life's ups and downs," said Ahles.  "He had a variety of jobs in corporate America.  When you have that kind of variety of experiences, it teaches you how to think and it teaches you how to make judgments when the facts aren't always clear.  I think Bill had a really good ability to do that.  When I was in meetings and I would see a group struggling, he always seemed to be a person to help us back on track."

	Adams's students hold dear to their hearts all that they have learned from him and will carry with them his memory and the knowledge he gave them wherever they go.

	"Everything I do is a reflection of what he taught me," said Armand.

	Nazly De La Rosa, president of the PRSSA agreed, "We're always going to be a reflection of what he taught."

	While those who knew Adams mourn his loss, many take comfort in knowing that he was a happy person who set out and accomplished all that he hoped to do--that he lived a life full of achievement and joy.

	"Yes, I'm very sad," said Mrs. Adams.  "but ... I know I'm gonna make it and I know that he's helped me become the person I am today.  My feeling is [that] Bill accomplished everything that he set out to accomplish.  Our kids are happy, everything was taken care of ... Bill Adams could have picked his last day there is not a single thing that he would have felt he didn't accomplish."

Caylor shared this belief that Adams' life was one well lived.  "I have peace in my heart that he did live life to the fullest" she said.  "And he touched so many lives, and he touched them gently and with humor and intelligence and enthusiasm and encouragement," she said.

	The loss of one of one of the most esteemed members of the FIU community has deeply saddened many.  Still, those who knew him are delighted to have known him and will remember him as more than a professor--they will remember him as a mentor and a motivating force.  

	"He was the perfect definition of a true leader," said De La Rosa proudly.  "He was a mentor and father to so many people.  He was a source of knowledge."

University Park candidates kick off campaign week at residence halls

Housing residents were introduced to some of the candidates running for student government office Monday night, capping the first day of the organization's campaigning week. 

By now, most candidates have already devised a strategy.

"Because I ran for rep. at large last year," said presidential candidate Jorge Rosario. "I know what to expect. We want to maintain a high level and plateau at the end [of campaign week]."

For Clayton Solomon and Ron Hollis, Rosario and running mate Ana Manrara's competition for president and vice president, being the first to make an impression on voters is the key to victory.

"Today was an opportunity to let people know we're here," Solomon said. "Everyone came out strong with the intent to get students first. If you're the first and last they see, they'll remember you."

Thinking back to his own campaign for vice president one year ago, Omar Castillo, the current vice president, said: "The way you start will define your campaign. It's good to start strong."

Candidates took their campaigning efforts past the familiar halls of the Graham Center and over to the Panther and Everglades halls Monday evening.

Panther Hall's conference room was half-full as about 40 students, many of them wearing the green T-shirts in support of the Rosario / Manrara ticket, came to hear the platforms of the 12 candidates who showed up.

Presidential and vice presidential candidates had three minutes to deliver their platforms. All others had two minutes.

"I came to basically get my face out," said Rosario, who promises to establish a scholarship for housing students. "I want [housing students] to know what I'm going to do for them."

Solomon and Hollis, who have both lived in housing, said they understand the students' problems. Having an ATM in the housing complex is feasible, Hollis said.

Candidate debates will be held at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday in the GC Pit. A debate at the Biscayne Bay Campus will be held at noon in Panther Square.  

Elections will be held April 1 and 2.

Headline: BBC presidential candidate committed to 'selfless service'
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Senior Alexander Lewy said he has always enjoyed serving his fellow man.  He was a boy scout until the age of 18, and he is currently the Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council vice president. Lewy is hoping he will get a chance to serve students in another capacity next year: as BBC-SGC president.

"I've always been someone who has been interested in serving people around me and doing community service-type events," Lewy said. "Selfless service has been something that I've been engaged in all my life." 

In his freshman year at FIU, Lewy founded the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. In his sophomore year, he was the BBC-SGC Campus Life board chair. Last year, he ran for BBC-SGC vice president unopposed.  

Some accomplishments during his term as vice president that he said he is proud of are the placement of hammocks at Bay Vista housing, a new second floor lounge outside the Wolfe University Center and the conversion of some faculty parking spaces into student spaces.

If Lewy is elected as president, there are several more things he wants to accomplish.

One of his short-term goals is giving students easier access to professor evaluations online.  

"One thing that students talk about all the time is how they don't know [the] teachers before they're jumping into the class," Lewy said. "We have the teacher evaluation sheets somewhat accessible, but they're a little bit too difficult [to access] for my tastes."

On the web registration class schedule, Lewy proposes linking the professor's name directly to his or her evaluation, so it would only be a click away for students. This can easily be accomplished by Fall 2003, he said.

Other issues on his platform include holding an ethics seminar for SGA, getting weekend food services for BBC, increasing the prestige of the Black Tie Affair and building more basketball courts.  Lewy suggested the new Bay Vista parking lots - which he said are being unused - as a possible location for additional basketball courts.

In addition, Lewy wants to establish a Student Academic Rights Advocacy group at BBC to help students who wish to claim academic grievances become informed of their rights within the university.  According to Lewy, students can be tried on hearsay and circumstantial evidence within the university, whereas neither of those would be acceptable forms of evidence in the county judicial system.

Another issue that is a high priority for Lewy is the phone system at Bay Vista. There are not enough lines, which makes it difficult for housing students to place calls, he said.

"They installed phone lines that aren't adequate," Lewy said. "I was in housing; I tried to place a phone call and I [couldn't].  I can't get an outside line because there aren't enough phone lines."

If he is elected, Lewy said this would be one of the first issues he would tackle.

"It needs to get resolved immediately," he said.

Check out next week's issue of The Beacon for Lewy's competition forBBC-SGC president, Rasheedah Muhammed.

Headline: Solomon ticket wants 24-hour study areas
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Juniors Clayton Solomon and Ronnie "Ron" Hollis are hoping to become the next dynamic duo in student government.  Solomon, who is running for University Park Student Government Council president, said he and his running mate Hollis form the perfect team.

	"I wanted to find someone who was going to complement what I didn't have," Solomon said. "Between the two of us we have every aspect of student life covered."

	Solomon, UP-SGC representative at-large, and Hollis, Student Programming Council president, have both been involved in the Student Government Administration and several other campus organizations.  

	Some of the positions Solomon has held are Pi Kappa Phi fraternity president, peer advisor, Dance Marathon moraler and SGA student union board chairman.  In his current position as rep at-large, Solomon serves on the Finance, Academic Affairs and Parking and Traffic committees. He has also participated in charity events, including the Journey of Hope and Gear Up Florida bike rides, which raised funds for people with disabilities.

	Hollis is an SGA standing council representative and Black Student Union member. He has also served as a Dance Marathon moraler, SPC films chairman and films vice chairman and has lived on campus for three years.

	As SPC president, Hollis said he expanded programming and increased student attendance at SPC events dramatically. One thing that he attributes to his success as SPC president is his willingness to listen to students.

	"Listening to students sometimes is the easiest way to serve them," he said.

Issues on Solomon and Hollis' platform include fighting excessive tuition increases, lobbying to save the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program, increasing support for FIU athletics on campus and in the community, and replacing the Social Security student ID system with student test numbers to protect students from the risk of identity theft.

"Identity theft is a growing concern across the nation as social security numbers are becoming more available to the general public," Solomon said. "We have a responsibility to protect our students from such risks."

	In addition, Solomon and Hollis want to provide more scholarships for international students, create a Judicial Rights Advisory Program to inform students of their rights in university judicial hearings and make the Graham Center and the first floor of the Green Library 24-hour study areas. Students looking for a quiet place to study at night often go to Dunkin' Donuts or other places off campus because campus facilities are closed, Solomon said.

	If elected as president, Solomon also plans to address the communication problem between UP-SGC and BBC-SGC by pushing for mandated monthly meetings between the councils. 

	While Solomon and Hollis admit that establishing a system that allows unlimited credit card use on campus is infeasible, they want to create what they see as the next best thing: a system that would allow students to use their credit cards to put money on their PantherCard ID.

	"By providing students with the opportunity to put money on their Panther ID card with their credit card, we are essentially enabling them to use their credit card for all on-campus purchases," Solomon said.

Headline: Business students hold food drive
Subheadline: Students collect more than a ton of food
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Students in Group 12 of the Weekend Bachelor of Business Administration program expected to help the community when they decided to hold a food drive as their class project.  What they didn't expect is to collect more than a ton of food and $1,460 for the Daily Bread Food Bank.

 "I was pleasantly surprised," Camila Puello, junior in the Weekend BBA program, said. "The class came through with flying colors."

Puello said she introduced the food drive idea to her "Business in Society" class after learning that one of the class requirements was to come up with a project that would benefit society. 

"We wanted to do something that really made a difference in our community," she said.

Although the class made flyers to advertise the March 15 drive, most of the donations came from the 42 students in the class, Puello said.

The Daily Bread Food Bank is grateful for their help.

"It comes at a very critical time," Keytia Amoedo, Daily Bread Food Bank director of food procurement, said. "The times are really tough right now.  The shelves are almost empty."

Amoedo attributes the current food shortages to the state of the economy.  Although donors get a tax break for their contributions, Amoedo said that is not a large enough incentive right now.

"Many donors would now rather sell the food for pennies on the dollar than wait until the end of the year to get a tax break," she said.

Amoedo was surprised that the class collected as much as it did.  An average food drive produces about 300 pounds of food, she said, which is less than 20 percent of what the class collected.

"Everybody really did a great job rallying friends and family and at their churches and jobs," Puello said.  

Donald Roomes, director of the Weekend BBA program, said the group exceeded his expectations.  

"They're a very motivated group," Roomes said. 

Apart from helping the needy, Roomes sees a larger purpose to the project, and said "social responsibility is a learning goal of the class."

 "We want to show that business has a moral imperative to respect and protect all stakeholders within the community," he said. "[This food drive] is a good example that there is still ethical and social responsibility in business."

Headline: Rosario ticket boasts expansive platform
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Junior Jorge Rosario, with the help of running-mate Ana Manrara, is looking to replace Jessica Morffi as University Park Student Government Council president next year.  Rosario, UP-SGC representative at large, and Manrara, UP-SGC clerk of council, hope their platform is expansive enough to win students over.

Their platform includes items that target housing, engineering, graduate and international students, and some that pertain to the general student body.

"What distinguishes us from other candidates in the past and now is that we are putting an emphasis on every student," Manrara, who is running for UP-SGC vice president, said.

Both Rosario and Manrara are involved at FIU. 

Rosario has had two years of experience in student government, serving as rep at-large this year and a staff writer/executive assistant last year. He has been on the finance, Ad Hoc engineering and Campus Life committees, and he is a peer advisor and student ambassador. Rosario is also a member of Sigma Alpha Mu.

Manrara, a junior, has been the Academic Affairs chair and is currently a student ambassador and a member of several honor societies.

If elected, Rosario said one of his top priorities as president will be to create more scholarships, especially for housing and international students.  

The scholarships would be financed by the UP-SGC presidential discretionary account, Rosario said.  The account can be spent at the sole discretion of the president and is currently worth about $13,000.  Some presidents have primarily used the account as a source of additional funds for organizations that have exhausted their budgets, Rosario said.

"In the past, presidents have kind of sat on that money and have kind of waited for students to come to them and [then they would] give it to them," Rosario said. "They've been more reactive. This year I want to be more proactive with it."

Rosario and Manrara also want to install an ATM in housing and contract a bus to transport housing students locally (similar to the Panther Prowler at the Biscayne Bay Campus).

In addition to creating another scholarship for international students, they also want to start a marketing campaign to make international students more aware of the issues that affect them.

For engineering students, they want to install an ATM at the engineering campus and invite more engineering companies to participate in career fairs. 

Increasing funding for graduate students and guaranteeing them a tax-exempt stipend are also on Rosario and Manrara's list of priorities.

They also have some issues on their platform that affect the general student body.  These include plans to continue lobbying for equitable funding for FIU, trying to secure a fixed fee rate with the company that processes credit card tuition payments and initiating an environmental action plan called Gracies Lake Clean-Up.

Headline: Webster wants to make BBC more 'student friendly'
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Sophomore Ruth Webster has been involved in student government since high school in Jamaica, where she served as treasurer and class president.  Now she is looking to tackle something bigger: the position of Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council vice president.

"I really want to make a difference at [the Biscayne Bay] campus," Webster said. "I really feel like this is my chance to really show FIU what I've got to give them."

Webster is currently the BBC-SGC director of Special Events, vice chair of Panther Power and   a peer advisor.

Improved customer service at FIU, more basketball courts at BBC, and the establishment of a student union board are some of the things Webster wants to accomplish if elected.  

She also wants to initiate Freshman Weekend, an event that would take place the weekend before the start of each semester.  This event would pair freshmen with upperclassmen to participate in "competitions, activities, team-building exercises and the repainting of paws on the road to campus," Webster said. The purpose of the event is to give incoming freshmen the opportunity to meet other students and get them involved at FIU, thus easing the transition from high school to college, she said.

Enhancing the appearance of the Academic One building with murals and other renovations is another of Webster's goals.

"What I want to do is really make Academic One more student friendly," she said.

Other issues in Webster's platform include investigating the water problem in Bay Vista housing, placing recycling bins around BBC and extending the hours of either the cafeteria or the Oasis to accommodate students who take classes at night.



Check out next week's issue of The Beacon for Webster's competition for BBC-SGC vice president, Hank Schramm.

Section: Opinion
Headline: In Our View: The Beacon recommends SGA candidates
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To coincide with the SGA elections, The Beacon releases a list of candidate recommendations. These recommendations are based on questionnaires the editorial board provided to each of the eligible candidates running for office on both university campuses. 

Presidential, vice presidential and representative at- large candidates who submitted questionnaires were then interviewed by the editorial board.

Candidates that did not submit a questionnaire were stricken from consideration.

University Park President and Vice President:

The Beacon recommends:

* Clayton Solomon and Ron Hollis

Other candidates: Jorge Rosario and Ana Manrara

These two tickets share many platform traits. Both tickets are quick to offer the "how" to their solutions, exemplifying the fiscal know-how that comes with serving on the SGA Finance Committee. Both tickets rallied against changes to Bright Futures scholarships and have an understanding of politics at the state level. Both tickets seek to expand scholarships for international students. 

The Solomon and Hollis ticket is stronger, however, in terms of experience and diversity. 

Solomon has served in SGA for three years, to Rosario's two. In addition, Solomon is also involved in the Florida Student Association as a liaison, and has been very active in philanthropic efforts. 

If the job of a vice president is to compliment the president, then Hollis is the consummate vice president. A three-year resident student, Hollis is naturally in touch with housing students, as well as the general student. As president of the Student Programming Council, Hollis has proven his ability to direct campus life while managing a large budget. 

The Solomon-Hollis ticket also offers innovative solutions for students at large: seeking to keep select areas of the Graham Center and Green Library open 24-hours for study, and paving the way for credit-card charging of PantherCards in order to allow credit purchases through PantherCard. The ticket also suggests replacing the use of Social Security numbers with a new student number to prevent identity theft, a growing concern.

The Rosario-Manrara ticket focuses on a litany of special interest students: 

They seek to install FIU Credit Union ATMs at FIU housing and at the engineering campus, plan to guarantee a tax-free stipend to graduate students, implement at UP a bus transport similar to BBC's Panther Prowler and initiate a clean-up of the Gracies pond.

Prior to this, Manrara, the vice presidential candidate, served only as an intern and later as SGC Clerk of Council, a mismatch against Hollis' lofty position and experience.

Biscayne Bay Campus President:

The Beacon recommends:

*Alexander Lewy

Other candidates: Rasheedah Muhammed, Admatha Israel

This recommendation comes with reservations. Lewy's platform appears weak. Among the issues he intends to address: investigating telephone malfunctions at BBC housing, making teacher evaluations easier to access, introducing "ethics workshops" for BBC SGC members, expanding the availability of basketball courts and food services on weekends. Not the kind of sweeping, wide-angle issues we expect from a presidential candidate. 

However, Lewy's experience is what gives him an advantage. As former BBC vice president, Lewy is already aware of the inner workings of SGA. He knows the names, the procedures and stands a better chance to hit the ground running than someone with more limited SGA experience.

Muhammed's SGA experience is limited to College of Health and Urban Affairs representative. While she seems more personable than Lewy, her platform is similarly weak: establishing a textbook trade website, expanding the availability of campus and inter-campus shuttles, adding lights to the soccer field and eliminating the $50 processing fee for housing students on financial aid who need to defer payment. All this begs the question: "how?" That is missing from Muhammed's agenda. 

Biscayne Bay Vice President:

The Beacon recommends:

* Hank Schramm

Other Candidates: Ruth Webster, Admatha Israel

Schramm's understanding of the issues and agenda are superior to either of the BBC presidential candidates, let alone any vice presidential candidate. Add to this his wealth of experience, and you have an obvious choice. At only 17 years of age, Schramm, the director of student lobbying for BBC SGC, has served for two years on the council, earned the honor of Representative of the Year and is the Florida Student Association chairman of governmental relations.

On his agenda: locking the rate increase of international student health insurance at 20 percent for the next three years, lobbying the federal government for funds to construct a building for the School of Journalism and Mass Communications, securing reduced fares for students on Miami-Dade county buses, restructuring the curriculum for First Year Experience classes to encourage involvement in campus life, increasing voter registration among students and developing ties with local hotels to increase internship opportunities for BBC's hospitality management students.

Webster, Schramm's competition, while experienced, has a more humble agenda: investigating the water problem at BBC housing, improving customer service and addressing the poor appearence of Academic One, as well as the introduction of a "Freshman Weekend," which would help freshman get a start on acclimating to FIU.

Webster's affable nature and sensitivity to student concerns leaves one feeling that she would have made a fine lower division representative, or perhaps even a representative at large, and is certainly a person that BBC SGC is better for having, but she is simply outmatched by Schramm.

Admatha Israel did not schedule an interview.

University Park Representative At Large (three elected):

The Beacon recommends: 

*The Beacon does not recommend any candidate

Other candidates: Nancy Cadavid, Leo DaSilva, Chrissie Fit, Malik Wilkes

The only two candidates who interviewd for the position, Cadavid and DaSilva, had neither the knowledge of the issues or SGA that were necessary in a position such as this. They also lacked SGA experience, having little or none. The other two candidates, Fit and Wilkes, did not schedule interviews.

Biscayne Bay Lower Division Representative:

The Beacon recommends:

*Micah Mintz

Other candidates: No other questionnaires were submitted.

Mintz seeks to establish a Kosher restaurant at BBC and to introduce incoming students to SGA at orientation.

Running unopposed:

Architecture Representative: Jennifer Fransen

Fransen seeks to bring more lectures and events to the architecture students, provide the university with information about the school and faciliate faculy and student interaction.

Engineering Representative: Marianne Espinoza

Espinoza Plans to continue the participation of the engineering ad-hoc committee and ensure the quality of teaching.

Graduate Student Representative (two elected): Aravinthan Arunachalam, Salman Azhar

Arunachalam plans to increase research funding, and conference funding. Also has plans to eliminate taxes on assistantships in conjunction with the National Association of Graduate and Professional Students, and increase awareness about graduate programs.

Azhar hopes to extend cafeteria hours, increase the availability of research books and journals at the library, increase the availability of graduate scholarships, and improve research facilities.

Housing Representative: Phillip L. Hamilton

Hamilton plans to organize walk-throughs with housing staff and administration, focus groups of concerned residents, as well as larger scale projects that reach outside of housing issues.

Lower Division Representative: Djenny Derane

As lower division representative, Derane hopes to create more jobs for lower division students through undergraduate research programs, reduce the failure rate of lower division classes, improve Freshman Experience curriculums, improve housing internet speeds, and promot FIU's reputation and school spirit.

The Beacon would like to thank those who took the time to submit questionnaires and schedule interviews and wish the best of luck to those candidates running for office.

It is worth noting, however, that partcipation was lacking. Too many cadidates did not bother to turn in their questionnaires.  

This simple service, provided by The Beacon, was a chance for students to get to know their future SGA representatives. In failing to submit a questionnaire, potential representatives have slighted their consitituents without yet having taken office.

In addition, many offices will be taken by candidates running unopposed.  This is a sad trend, and a disservice to voters. We can only hope that in the future, enough students will take the initiative and run for office, so that voters might be able to choose the candidate they feel will represent them best.  

SGA is our voice.  Only by participating can we make our voice heard.

Headline: Miami is a city full of dualities
Author: John Colagrande Jr. / Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Rather than pontificating world affairs, a brief meditation on the quality of life in Miami and Ft. Lauderdale is in order. 

What is it about South Florida?

If there is anything bad or embarrassing going on inside America, look for South Florida to be the odds on favorite to host the event. 

First, that little Elian Gonzalez fiasco kept Miami in the headlines for months. Then, the election controversy of 2000 that was centered in all three South Florida counties. 

Finally, we had the privilege to house Mohammed Atta and his band of Merry Terrorists, in Coral Springs of all places.

South Florida has been under the national telescope frequently over the last five years. 

Granted, Los Angeles was doing its best to keep up with Rodney King and O.J. Simpson, but, mind you, when Simpson got away with murder he moved out of Los Angeles to the only place in the world that would take him, Miami.

There has to be something in our water; incidentally, the city of Miami spends more than a million dollars a year cleaning the water of sacrificial remains put there by people practicing Santeria, so, actually, there is something in the water. 

Our geographic entity has to be one of the most bizarre places on the planet. 

There isn't an area in the world with more dualities. 

The weather's hot but the people are cold. 

The ocean is flat but our storms rage. 

The culture is rich but our schools are poor. 

Only in Miami can a pair of French sisters at the beach get run over and crushed to death by a cop in a jeep chasing robbers. 

Only on South Beach can bums and supermodels wait at the same crosswalk together. Dualities. 

Every nationality in the world is represented in South Florida. 

There's no telling what the future of America is going to look like but whatever it is it will resemble the multi-cultured face of Miami, that is a good thing. 

Every ethnicity in the world is represented here but there is little unity, little coagulation, among the cultures. 

The tossed salad metaphor is used to describe South Florida, a place with different ingredients that do not blend together like a melting pot. That is not a good thing. 

The public schools in South Florida are struggling as the budgets continue to get slashed with Tallahassee rewarding "good" schools and punishing poor ones. 

It's hard to become a "good" school in South Florida. 

Teachers find it hard instructing toward the FCAT exam that is cultural biased against students who don't speak English as a first language, it's a catch-22, not a good situation, yet at FIU, a state resident can get a top-notch education for a cheap tuition, good thing. 

Dualities.

The most beautiful women in the world call South Florida home, it's a great thing, but the fact that the STD rates in Miami, West Palm Beach and Ft. Lauderdale are all among the top 10 in American cities is no question: a bad thing. 

Dualities.

Dave Barry and Carl Hiassen write for the Miami Herald. Pat Riley coaches the Heat. Ricky Williams is a Dolphin. These are all good things. 

The cops in Broward County are jerks, Kendall has built an invisible force field around itself in a fit of isolationism, the Monkey Jungle is way out in Cutler Ridge, and you can't buy beer past 10 p.m. on South Beach. 

These are all bad things.

Ah, the dualities; like me writing for the school newspaper, good thing, but that picture next to my name, very bad, it looks like I eat Frosted Flakes and I'm afraid to admit it, like I'm a shadow, hey, Beacon, I'm Italian but I'm not that dark.

Headline: Nations must reconcile, continue to wage war on terrorism
Author: John C. Bersia / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Saddam Hussein achieved his greatest success just before the beginning of the U.S.-led invasion last week, even as he was committing what the White House termed his "last mistake."

Consider that the Iraq crisis diverted attention from other pressing issues such as the global war against terrorism; divided the world, particularly the West; heightened concerns about U.S. unilateralist impulses; rallied extremists to lash out against U.S. interests; caused turmoil among the NATO allies; disrupted the European Union; and handed Saddam a coveted center stage in the Arab world and in the broader Middle East. 

As Saddam recedes into history, the political dust he kicked up lingers. What to do? 

Part of the answer will come in the way nations that opposed immediate military action in Iraq respond to the war and its aftermath. Will they keep hurling invective at the Bush administration or recognize that global ranks must close at some point? 

Of course, they have the option to continue opposing the U.S-led military invasion. But the longer the international community waits to return to a consensus on Iraq and to establish common ground on other pressing issues, the less certain and secure the future world will be.

One argument for renewed cooperation stems from the unsavory nature of Saddam's regime. Many of the nations that vehemently opposed short-term military action against Iraq did so on the basis of principle or self-interest, not because they loved Saddam or his alleged weapons of mass destruction. 

Moreover, those same nations did not necessarily oppose a military solution in Iraq - especially if weapons of mass destruction had turned up and Saddam had refused to destroy them, suggesting their potential use. 

Whether holdouts simply acknowledge the new realities diplomatically or seek a more active role is not that important at present. The United States and its active allies in the war effort have more than enough capability to handle the situation in Iraq. 

At the war's end, however, countries that opt to linger at the sidelines would shirk their responsibility. Over the years, Iraq developed into a global problem. It requires a global solution. Thus, the burden of rebuilding and reforming Iraq falls as much to spectator nations as to those spearheading the intervention. 

Another part of the answer lies in how nations that opposed immediate military action in Iraq deal with the United States on other critical issues. Will they automatically bristle, assuming that Washington will try to bulldoze its way through upcoming debates? 

Just as important, will the Bush administration, encouraged by its anticipated success in Iraq, feel even less obligated to consult other countries in dealing with crises?

Either of those outcomes would exacerbate international friction just when the world's challenges demand greater cooperation. It's the kind of new world order we can live without.

The worst threat to civilization - terrorism with global ambitions and reach - will draw inspiration and new followers from the war. In light of that danger, nations should waste no more time tearing at each other's throats.

In addition, dealing with the Iraq crisis will not cure the Middle East of its ills, including the region's most urgent and dangerous worry: Arab-Israeli tensions, especially strife between Israelis and Palestinians. 

A few days before war started with Iraq, President Bush promised to pursue new peace initiatives and to provide details about achieving a Palestinian state by 2005. The United States, while properly playing a lead role in those endeavors, can't hope to succeed on its own.

Finally, it's conceivable that the post-Iraq war environment could buoy confidence and point toward an economic recovery, similar to what happened after the Gulf War of 1991. 

Those opportunities will remain elusive, though, if the United States and its critics fail to clear away the haze of acrimony that Saddam leaves as part of his nefarious legacy.

Headline: In the wake of war, U.S. alliances likely to shift
Author: Peter A. Brown / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Wars do more than kill people and redraw maps. They force nations, both spectators and participants, to re-examine their ambitions, interests and obligations. 

The Iraq war will do just that, not just for America, but the world. 

For the United States, it means reviewing treaty obligations and reassessing friendships. For Europeans, it's more serious. They have bet their future on a homogeneity that is coming apart at its seams.

The impending conflict spotlights significant fissures between the United States on one side, and France and Germany, which have dominated the European Union since its inception, on the other.

But it also showcases emerging friendships with one-time enemies. The Eastern European nations, which were on Moscow's payroll during the Cold War, are now on the U.S. side in this dispute.

This reassessment may be especially sticky in Europe, where it appears questionable that the continent really is on its way to becoming the "United States of Europe." 

With Great Britain, Spain and Italy and many of the former Easternbloc nations on one side vs. the French, Germans and Dutch on the other, don't look for happy days within the EU and Common Market. 

The Iraq war will be the catalyst for a reshaping of the global order that began after the Cold War. 

Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, every action was seen through a Cold War prism. The superpowers kept their less-powerful allies in line, and each side had its own alliances. In Europe, the good guys had the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the communists had the Warsaw Pact. 

The United Nations, whose structure reflected the world as it was in 1945 (it gave France a veto on the Security Council) was also split along those lines. For that reason, it rarely intervened in superpower disputes.

For the United States, the post-Iraq reassessment will likely mean more than just a re-evaluation of the U.S. role in, and relationship with, the United Nations; it will mean a review of its alphabet alliances.

It could, as some have suggested, lead to American efforts to change the structure of the United Nations, how it does its business, or perhaps a lessening of the U.S. commitment to the world body. 

It's worth remembering that the League of Nations became irrelevant precisely because the United States never participated. Any further reduction in the U.S. commitment to the United Nations will threaten that body's 21st-century relevancy.

After all, it is hard to fathom why the United States should have to lobby small, insignificant nations such as Cameroon or Angola, as was required for U.N. support on Iraq, to pursue America's national interests.

Still remaining is the formal reshuffling of past alliances to account for the relationships that have emerged from the dispute over how and when to deal with Saddam Hussein. 

President Bush should encourage that reshuffling.

The United States will grow closer, and perhaps formalize, relationships with some nations. And it should come as no surprise that we have the functional equivalents of separations with others. 

As World War II ended U.S. isolation in world affairs and marked its emergence as the planet's unquestioned power, albeit one pitted against the Soviet bloc, the Iraq war will force many countries to rethink how they relate to each other.

Let's not be sentimental about it. Times change, and people with them. The same is true of nations.

Headline: Baseball wins seven of eight games
Author: By Steve Perhla/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers reeled off seven wins in eight games over the past two weeks, to improve to 22-7 on the season.

March 10- FIU 7, Seton Hall 0

Andrew Edwards, Manuel Monreal, and Derek DeCarlo combined to throw nine shut out innings, while allowing only three hits, as the Golden Panthers blanked the Seton Hall Pirates 7-0 at University Park.

Catcher Michael New (2-for-4, one RBI) and shortstop Luis Rivera (2-for-4, two runs) provided the bulk of the offensive damage for FIU during a three-run fourth inning that saw the Golden Panthers jump out to a 5-0 lead.

Monreal (2-1) earned the win for FIU, allowing only one hit in 4.1 innings of scoreless relief, while striking out six.

March 12- FIU 22,
Chicago State 7

Sophomore second baseman Dennis Diaz went 5-for-6 with three runs scored, three RBI, four doubles and a stolen base as FIU destroyed Chicago State 22-7 at University Park. 

Luis Rivera (2-for-2, three RBI), Yahmed Yema (2-for-3, four RBI) and James Bacon (2-for-5, five RBI) also contributed heavily to the Golden Panther offensive outburst.

Senior Derek Taylor (3-0) earned the win for the FIU, who used six different pitchers to combine for 14 strikeouts in the game.

Freshman Edgar Ramirez was brilliant in relief, closing out the final two innings with five strikeouts. 

March 15- FIU 2, Rider 0

The Golden Panthers, led by junior pitcher Josh Banks, shut out Rider 2-0 at University Park. 

Banks (4-1), went the distance for FIU, pitching nine innings, giving up no runs on six hits, while striking out 10 to earn his first complete game of the season.

Senior third baseman Skip Adams manufactured both Golden Panther runs, going 1-for-2 with two RBI.

Luis Rivera and Mike Lopez chipped in as well, combining for three hits and two runs for FIU.

March 16- Kansas State 17, FIU 5

The pitching and defense were just as sloppy as the weather conditions, as the Golden Panthers committed four errors and allowed 17 hits in a sloppy 17-5 loss to the Wildcats at home, after a two hour rain delay to begin the game.

Manuel Monreal (2-2) got hit hard in the loss, giving up 11 hits and eight runs in only three innings.

Derek Taylor and Frank Gonzalez also struggled in relief of Monreal, combining to allow eight hits and eight runs in four innings.

Center fielder Ricardo Nanita led the Golden Panthers offense, going 2-for-4 with two RBI as the lone bright spot for FIU.

March 17- FIU 6,
Stony Brook 3

Sophomore ace Derek DeCarlo improved his career record to 14-0 as FIU defeated Stony Brook 6-3 on a wet St. Patrick's Day night at University Park. 

James Bacon who went 1-for-3, with a homerun, and Skip Adams (2-for-3, two RBI) combined to lead the Golden Panther offense. 
Senior Andrew Edwards started the game and pitched two scoreless innings before being replaced by DeCarlo.

With the 14 consecutive wins, DeCarlo (3-0) surpassed Willy Collazo as the Golden Panthers all-time leader for consecutive victories. 

March 18- FIU 12,
Rutgers 10

James Bacon went 4-for-5 with two RBI as the Golden Panthers outslugged the Scarlet Knights 12-10 at University Park.

Dennis Diaz (3-for-5, three runs), and Ricardo Nanita (2-for-5, two RBI) also played well for FIU, who recorded 14 hits in the contest.

Left fielder Fernando Alvarez also chipped in with a two-run homer in the third inning.

Sophomore Luis Gazitua (1-0) earned the win for FIU, giving up only one run in four innings, while striking out six.

March 21- FIU 7, 
Arkansas-Little Rock 6

FIU began Sun-Belt Conference play with a 7-6 win over Arkansas-Little Rock in Little Rock.

Junior Josh Banks led FIU, striking out a career high 12 batters.

Banks (5-1) pitched eight solid innings, allowing only two runs on four hits, while increasing his team leading strikeout total to 68 on the season.

March 22- FIU 10, 
Arkansas Little-Rock 7

Derek DeCarlo won again for FIU, earning his 15th straight victory as a Golden Panther, as FIU held off another late rally by the Trojans, winning 10-7 on the road. 

The Golden Panther offense was led by Luis Rivera (4-for-5, two RBI), Skip Adams (2-for-4, two runs, RBI), and Adam Summerell (2-for-5, two RBI).

Junior Fernando Alvarez also contributed for FIU, hitting his second homerun in three nights.

DeCarlo (4-0) pitched seven innings while striking out eight. 
Derek Taylor closed out the final two innings, preserving the win for DeCarlo.

Headline: Strock: speed, strength to bolster team's performance
Author: By Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Numbers in FIU's weight room have been off the charts and head coach Don Strock is positive that the increased speed and strength will reflect on his team's performance when spring practice begins Wednesday afternoon. 

Strock and his staff have seen players' numbers in the bench press and squat exercises more than triple since the programs inception in the fall of 2001, while forty percent of the Golden Panthers improved their times in the 40-yard dash.

"A lot of guys have been very impressive in their individual workouts and now we have to see how it correlates on the field," Strock said. "But we have to be better because of it."

How these off-season workouts correlate to the offensive line, a unit that suffered last year with injuries and fundamental problems in their maturation process, is the number one priority when camp begins. 

Cohesiveness will be sought, as the offensive linemen will be able to work with each other as well as the same coach from a year ago, Steve Smith. Last year's unit is in tact and will be anchored by the slimmer of Victor Cernius, who has trimmed down and improved greatly in his 40 time from 5.44 to 5.09 seconds.      

"Vic has improved tremendously in all four of our tests and he's gone from 317 to 285 pounds," said Strock, who moved Cernius from tackle to center last season. "Last year his weight really started slowing down his reactions." 

In addition to Cernius, the offensive line should receive some assistance from Patrick Mullen, a 6-foot-8-inch, 300 plus pounder that was highly sought after coming out of Palm Beach Gardens' Dwyer High School. Mullen, who Strock says never had a coach in high school to teach him technique, is out at Community Stadium on the weekends working on his footwork and technique that he learned at FIU. 

As for the opposite side of the trenches, the coaching staff is hoping that Ronny Silva (320) and Pedro Farias (310), two redshirts from a year ago, will give them size up front. However, they are trying to fit in to a line that will serve as the façade to a new look defensive unit that the Golden Panthers hope to field come August. "We definitely want to tinker some with the thirty-four [3-4] defense," said Strock. "We would like to run this defense as much as possible in the spring to see if our guys know where to go in different situations."

However, Strock is mainly looking for his recruits to be the ones that emerge and fill voids when they report this summer, especially Antwan Barnes (LB), Alexander Bostic (LB), and Samuel Smith (TE). 

"I don't know that anything is wide-open right now," said Strock, who feels competition is a good thing to have among college athletes. "We are looking for guys to be able to come in and play, more like 1A and 1B type situations."

No position holds more uncertainty than that of running back, which boasts three returning backs, who all saw considerable amounts of playing time because of nagging injuries to the others. Also involved in the mix are Diamos Demerritt and Dravien Jones, who were redshirted because of injury and are able to participate this spring with limited contact. Throw in Miami Gulliver's Marcus Jones this summer and newly hired running backs coach Tony Nathan will have an abundance of talent to work with. 

"There are a lot of different guys that can do a lot of different things," said Strock. "If everyone stays healthy this can be a real strength for us."

FIU's coaching staff should be watching closely as this is the Golden Panthers' first step en route to a considerably tough schedule. FIU will face Division I-A schools such as Troy State and Louisiana-Lafayette, as well as I-AA powers Maine, Bethune-Cookman and Georgia Southern. Also slated to play FIU is Carson Newman; a team that played for the Division II championship last season. 

"McNeese State has also called us," said Strock, who has planned to play South Florida, Youngstown State, and Connecticut in 2004. "We want to go to Division 1-A, we cannot move backwards."

&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers fell in the first round of the National Invitational Tournament to in-state rival Florida State on Thursday night in Tallahassee, Fla, 77-51. 

The defeat ended the careers of seniors Cormisha Cotton, Anita Heller, Silvia Mesa and Mandy Shafer.

The 2002-03 campaign for FIU ended with an overall record of 19-11. FIU received the invitation to the tournament after being eliminated by South Alabama in the quarterfinals of the Sun Belt Conference Tournament March 9 by a score of 74-57.

The Seminoles (17-12) were led by Tasheika Morris who scored a game-high 26 points, which was also the margin of victory for FSU. 
The 26-point defeat was  second only to a 106-58 defeat to then No. 1 Duke as the worst of the year for FIU. 

The Golden Panthers trailed most of the contest before cutting  the lead to 39-37 on a layup by Dace Cinite with 12:58 remaining in the game. Then FSU pieced together a 16-2 run to pull away from FIU.

The Seminoles maintained control on the boards holding a 47-36 advantage in rebounds which was also the largest deficit in that category for the Golden Panthers this season.  

Morris put up 17 points in the first half on 7-for-10 shooting from the field. FSU had eleven players score in the game.

FIU was led by Ivelina Vrancheva's 14 points. Cotton added 13 points despite being in foul trouble for much of the game.

"I thought Cormisha did a nice job in the first half," said FIU head coach Cindy Russo said. "She got a little timid in the second half and that hurt us."

Cotton, averaged 11.7 points per outing, good for second best on the squad. She also led the team with 49 blocked shots and 269 total rebounds on the year.

Heller completed her final season with an average of 8.5 points and and 1.8 rebounds per game. 

Mesa, labeled the tallest women's basketball player in Division I-A at 6 feet 8 inches, averaged 5.3 points and 2.6 rebounds. Her 27 blocks was second only to Cotton in that category.

Shafer became the 16th Golden Panther to reach the 1,000 point mark after FIU's 96-44 win over Arkansas-Little Rock on March 1. She led the team with 15.7 points per game and also had more steals (53) than any other player.

The Womens program benefited greatly from the leadership of the four seniors as the team went 46-17 the past two seasons and won the conference tournament in 2002.  FIU beat Creighton but lost to Penn State to end that season.

Headline: Crímenes de mujeres: la falta de evidencia

&nbsp;

Lo más representativo del expediente de más de 400 páginas contra Gustavo González Meza, alias la Foca, y Víctor Javier García Uribe, alias el Cerrillo, no es lo que está incluido en la acusación, sino lo que no está. A ellos se los acusó del asesinato de ocho mujeres jóvenes de Ciudad Juárez, México.

Sin embargo, faltan testimonios que se revelaron y rindieron ante la prensa y que no existen en la acusación formal y falta el automóvil donde mataron a las víctimas. Sólo un elemento vincula a los dos choferes con los asesinatos: su confesión. Las evidencias que las autoridades han presentado para demostrar la culpabilidad de los acusados desmienten la misma confesión y destruyen las propias hipótesis de la Procuraduría General de Justicia del Estado (PGJE) sobre la forma en que se realizaron los asesinatos.

En su confesión, la Foca y el Cerillo afirman que antes de matar a las mujeres tomaban cerveza y se drogaban con cocaína y mariguana. Dos testigos, los choferes de camiones urbanos Jesús García Moreno y Víctor Manuel Morales Lugo, dicen haber trabajado con los sospechosos, y aseguran que desde hace años los dos consumían cocaína y mariguana. 

Pero el mismo expediente incluye tres exámenes antidoping aplicados al Cerillo. El primero fue practicado el 16 de diciembre de 1999 por el médico Pedro Alvarado Cadillo, de la Dirección de Tránsito y Transporte de Gobierno del Estado, donde se estableció que García Uribe "no utiliza para su consumo mariguana, cocaína u otras sustancias prohibidas por la ley". El segundo fue practicado por la empresa Quest Diagnostics el 5 de diciembre del 2000, 47 días después del secuestro y asesinato de Verónica Martínez Hernández, y el tercero el 19 de diciembre del 2001, ya en prisión, y 51 días después de la muerte de Esmeralda Herrera Monrreal, por el químico Julio César del Hierro Ochoa. Los dos primeros exámenes se practicaron como parte de estudios aleatorios para detectar uso de drogas en choferes de transporte urbano.

Varios químicos particulares concuerdan en que el cuerpo tarda de seis meses a un año en eliminar los restos de estas drogas, lo que desmiente el argumento de que usaban drogas antes de cometer los asesinatos. 

"Si ellos la usaron (la droga), debió aparecer en el antidoping", afirma el químico Marco Arturo Acosta, quien realiza este tipo de análisis para un laboratorio privado. También se aplicaron antidopings a los dos acusados al momento de su detención, pero "los resultados no han sido dados a conocer porque salieron negativos", dice el abogado defensor, quien afirma que la autoridad ha ocultado los resultados porque serían un elemento contundente para demostrar que la confesión fue prefabricada.

La PGJE tampoco ha podido explicar las inconsistencias sobre el vehículo que se usó para matar a las mujeres. Una mujer identificada como Laura Güereca declaró haber visto en dos ocasiones a un hombre "muy guapo" en un auto azul viejo, "tipo Chevy Nova", cerca del lugar donde encontraron los cuerpos. Güereca afirmó que la primera vez el hombre sacó un gato hidráulico y "después algo" de la cajuela de su auto, mientras que la segunda vez, sólo lo vio abrir la cajuela. Ambos avistamientos fueron entre las ocho y nueve de la noche.

Güereca también afirmó que el "hombre muy guapo" vestía con corbata y de manera formal, era delgado y de tez blanca. Dos horas después Güereca amplió su declaración e indicó que el hombre se parecía mucho al que aparecía en tres fotografías polaroid del Cerillo, "sólo que cuando lo vi vestía más formal y además por lo limpio me pareció de tez más clara y sin bigote". El Cerillo es de tez morena oscura, en ese entonces tenía un prominente abdomen y ante el juez testificó que nunca se ha rasurado el bigote.

Si la declaración de Güereca es cierta, implicaría que el Cerillo se estacionó sobre la calle Ejército Nacional, una de las calles con más tráfico en la ciudad, y cargó los cuerpos al menos 150 metros para depositarlos en el canal de irrigación donde se encontraron.

Oscar Maynes, ex jefe de peritos de la PGJE en Ciudad Juárez, no duda en restarle crédito al testimonio de Güereca. 

"De estar abriendo la cajuela, a tirar ocho cuerpos hay una diferencia abismal. Aparte, si voy a tirar ocho cuerpos no los voy a andar cargando, me meto (al terreno) con el carro", dice Maynes. 

Güereca tampoco mencionó a la Foca en las dos ocasiones que dijo ver al Cerillo, a pesar de que los acusados declararon que entre los dos se deshacían de los cuerpos.

La misma testigo confundió las fechas. Primero aseguró que vio al hombre "entre dos y dos meses y medio", es decir, a finales de agosto o inicios de septiembre, pero momentos después dijo que "sería entre los días últimos de julio y primeros de agosto", es decir de tres a tres meses y medio antes.

Lo cierto es que entre los días que mencionó Güereca no se presentó ningún homicidio. Las fechas más próximas son el 25 de junio, cuando desapareció Mayra Juliana, y el 25 de septiembre, cuando secuestraron a Laura Berenice Ramos Monárrez, dos mujeres que ni siquiera están entre los ochos cuerpos. La única fecha que coincide es la del segundo avistamiento, ocurrido de tres a tres semanas y media antes del 9 de noviembre, la cual correspondería con la desaparición de Claudia Ivette González. Si Güereca vio al Cerillo depositar este cadáver en el terreno, el acusado tuvo que cargar un cuerpo de 56 kilos y 1.62 metros de alto por 174 metros desde la transitada calle.

Días después de su testimonio Güereca declaró a la prensa estar confundida por lo que vio. El abogado Dante Almaraz asegura que "Güereca se retractó y les pidió disculpas a las esposas" de los sospechosos.

Pero la misma confesión de los choferes parece estar preparada para ajustarse a las evidencias. En su declaración del 9 y 10 de noviembre, los choferes aseguran que mataron y violaron a las ocho jovencitas en un viejo auto azul. El viejo auto azul nunca apareció. 

Más inconsistencias

La tarde del 11 de noviembre, la Foca y el Cerillo cambiaron su declaración y afirmaron que habían mentido anteriormente y que el vehículo que realmente usaron para cometer los crímenes fue una camioneta tipo van Chevrolet, vieja, de color crema con franjas negras. 

Y a pesar de que originalmente el Cerillo confesó a las 10:30 p.m. del día 9 y la Foca a las 4 a.m. del día 10, este último reveló que tuvo acceso a la declaración de su compañero cuando dijo lo siguiente: "Yo dije que era un carro en el que violábamos a las muchachas pero lo dije porque me basé en lo que declaró el Cerillo y la verdad es que las violábamos en la camioneta".

La descripción de lo que vivieron las muchachas en la camioneta es brutal: eran golpeadas con los puños, bates de béisbol, abusadas sexualmente y estranguladas hasta morir.

Y a pesar de todo lo que sucedía en el vehículo según la confesión, el examen de luminol para detectar rastros de sangre en la camioneta resultó negativo, descartando que ahí se sucitaran hechos violentos.

Al mismo tiempo que se buscaban rastros de sangre, el sub agente del Ministerio Público Víctor Hugo Estrada Aragón y el perito en criminalística de campo Armando Rodríguez descubrieron 23 cabellos. Ninguno ha sido relacionado con las víctimas, a pesar de que el mismo procurador de entonces, Arturo González Rascón, afirmó que los asesinos "firmaban" sus crímenes cortando el cabello de sus víctimas.

Los cabellos simplemente no coincidían con las víctimas. "Eran de perro. Ahí era donde dormían los perros, pues la camioneta tenía 6 meses descompuesta", dice Sergio Dante Almaraz. Además, González Rascón arruinó la posibilidad de vincular futuros homicidios con el caso, pues divulgó en los medios la firma del asesino.

La declaración de que las mujeres eran asesinadas en la van también desmiente a Güereca. Ella vio un auto azul viejo. Los choferes "depositaron" los cuerpos en una van crema.

Además, señala Maynes, "la famosa van de los choferes no entra al terreno (donde encontraron los cuerpos), es una carcacha" y el lugar era de muy difícil acceso.

"En cualquier tribunal civilizado se requieren evidencias. Cosas que te ubican al menos alrededor de las víctimas y aquí no hay siquiera eso", dice Maynes. "La PGJE no puede poner a los choferes en el mismo lugar de las muchachas porque ni siquiera saben dónde estaban las muchachas. No hay nada de evidencia. Cero". 

Para Maynes, todas estas inconsistencias son suficientes para demostrar la inocencia de los choferes, pero asegura que la acusación sigue en pie porque los jueces trabajan bajo consigna de la PGJE y el gobierno del Estado. 

"Cuando tienes a los jueces bajo control, lo demás es irrelevante", dice Maynes sobre la falta de evidencia.

La fiscalía, desplazada

Las negligencias e irregularidades de la investigación de las ocho muertes comenzaron desde el mismo 6 de noviembre de 2001, cuando aparecieron los primeros tres cadáveres en un campo de algodón. Nunca se realizó una investigación seria, jamás se plantearon varias hipótesis. Desde el primer momento, el sospechoso fue el Cerillo y los agentes policiacos se abocaron a encontrarlo y sacarle la confesión.

Ese martes llegó a Ciudad Juárez un grupo de agentes de la PGJE procedente de la ciudad de Chihuahua y se hizo cargo del caso. Así se desplazó a la Fiscalía Especial para los Crímenes contra Mujeres, a la cual le correspondía hacerse cargo del caso y la cual a penas se había enfocado en la búsqueda de cuerpos y tratar de identificar a las víctimas. 

De hecho, ese 6 de noviembre, antes de que los peritos encontraran el total de los cuerpos, y mucho antes de que identificaran a las víctimas, el agente del Ministerio Público Jesús Manuel González Guerrero ya tenía un sospechoso: el Cerillo. Un oficio, fechado por González Guerrero ese día e incluido en el expediente, ordena reunir todas las declaraciones previas de Gaspar Ceballos, alias el Gaspy, en las que involucra al Cerillo en la violación y asesinato de una mujer, a pesar de que este fue exonerado en ese juicio.

"El domingo 11 estaba a las 9 de la mañana en la oficina y fue cuando notamos que había llegado todo el personal de Chihuahua y fue cuando presentaron a los choferes", dice Maynes. 

"Llevábamos investigaciones paralelas y llegó un momento en el que dijeron, bueno, ustedes se hacen a un lado y déjenos a nosotros", dice Zulema Bolívar García, en ese tiempo la fiscal especial para la investigación de homicidios de mujeres.

Bolívar asegura que la fiscalía sólo se centró en encargar los estudios periciales que les solicitaron y en preparar las muestras para los exámenes de ADN. 

"Lo que es la investigación y la consignación, ahí nosotros no intervenimos", dice Bolívar.

Ahora, ella afirma desconocer el estado del proceso contra los choferes o si hay evidencias suficientes para condenarlos. "Ni siqueira leí el expediente por dignidad, a mí me sacan de la investigación, por qué, no lo sé ni me interesa", dice.

"Tuvieron que traer a gente totalmente carente de escrúpulos para poder sacar este trabajo", afirma Maynes indignado. El ex jefe de peritos está convencido de que la participación de lo que él llama policías de la vieja escuela contribuyó a que el verdadero asesino esté libre. Insiste en que este tipo de agentes resuelven los crímenes sin conducir investigaciones científicas, sino recuerriendo a la tortura y la fabricación de pruebas y chivos expiatorios.

Tras la detención de los dos choferes, tres días después del descubrimiento de los cuerpos, los agentes de Chihuahua cerraron el caso y cancelaron todas las investigaciones, dice Maynes, lo que dejó muchas interrogantes en el aire. 

"Estábamos abocados desde el principio a identificar a las víctimas. Era lo primordial", explica. "¿Cómo se investiga un homicidio sin saber quién es la víctima?".  

Tanto la ex fiscal Bolívar como el actual coordinador de Ministerios Públicos de la fiscalía, Manuel Esparza Navarrete, coinciden en que la orden de desplazar a la fiscalía provino desde arriba, y aunque no especifican de dónde, sugieren que pudo ser el gobernador Patricio Martínez o el entonces procurador, Arturo González Rascón. 

"En un momento dado el señor gobernador o el señor procurador determinan que un asunto es de cierta relevancia... y en momento dado ellos pueden designar el personal que ellos consideren necesario, o el que ellos consideren que es pertinente maneje la investigación", dice Esparza.

Para Maynes, lejos de resolver los asesinatos, el actuar de las autoridades fue el siguiente: "Se necesita cerrar el caso, busquen ocho de los cuerpos y póngales dos personas que confiesen y un juez que sea parcial y ya".

"El domingo 11 estaba a las 9 de la mañana en la oficina y fue cuando notamos que había llegado todo el personal de Chihuahua y fue cuando presentaron a los choferes", dice Maynes. 

"Llevábamos investigaciones paralelas y llegó un momento en el que dijeron, bueno, ustedes se hacen a un lado y déjenos a nosotros", dice Zulema Bolívar García, en ese tiempo la fiscal especial para la investigación de homicidios de mujeres.

Bolívar asegura que la fiscalía sólo se centró en encargar los estudios periciales que les solicitaron y en preparar las muestras para los exámenes de ADN. 

"Lo que es la investigación y la consignación, ahí nosotros no intervenimos", dice Bolívar.

Ahora, ella afirma desconocer el estado del proceso contra los choferes o si hay evidencias suficientes para condenarlos. "Ni siqueira leí el expediente por dignidad, a mí me sacan de la investigación, por qué, no lo sé ni me interesa", dice.

"Tuvieron que traer a gente totalmente carente de escrúpulos para poder sacar este trabajo", afirma Maynes indignado. El ex jefe de peritos está convencido de que la participación de lo que él llama policías de la vieja escuela contribuyó a que el verdadero asesino esté libre. Insiste en que este tipo de agentes resuelven los crímenes sin conducir investigaciones científicas, sino recuerriendo a la tortura y la fabricación de pruebas y chivos expiatorios.

Tras la detención de los dos choferes, tres días después del descubrimiento de los cuerpos, los agentes de Chihuahua cerraron el caso y cancelaron todas las investigaciones, dice Maynes, lo que dejó muchas interrogantes en el aire. 

"Estábamos abocados desde el principio a identificar a las víctimas. Era lo primordial", explica. "¿Cómo se investiga un homicidio sin saber quién es la víctima?".  

Tanto la ex fiscal Bolívar como el actual coordinador de Ministerios Públicos de la fiscalía, Manuel Esparza Navarrete, coinciden en que la orden de desplazar a la fiscalía provino desde arriba, y aunque no especifican de dónde, sugieren que pudo ser el gobernador Patricio Martínez o el entonces procurador, Arturo González Rascón. 

"En un momento dado el señor gobernador o el señor procurador determinan que un asunto es de cierta relevancia... y en momento dado ellos pueden designar el personal que ellos consideren necesario, o el que ellos consideren que es pertinente maneje la investigación", dice Esparza.

Para Maynes, lejos de resolver los asesinatos, el actuar de las autoridades fue el siguiente: "Se necesita cerrar el caso, busquen ocho de los cuerpos y póngales dos personas que confiesen y un juez que sea parcial y ya".

Headline: Bajo una amenaza intangible
Subheadline: Patricia Movilla
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;

La preocupación general de la población por un potencial ataque con armas biológicas aumentó después de los golpes terroristas del 11 de septiembre de 2001, según el Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Los principales institutos y centros de estudios biológicos reciben constantes llamadas de personas que buscan información acerca del bioterrorismo, qué son las armas biológicas, cuál es su alcance y qué medidas pueden tomar para protegerse. 

La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), al igual que otros organismos internacionales y nacionales, participa en la investigación sobre las armas biológicas. La OMS las define como: "instrumentos utilizados intencionalmente para causar enfermedades o muertes por medio de la propagación de microorganismos o toxinas a través de alimentos, agua, insectos o en forma de aerosol".

Asimismo, la OMS destaca que los objetivos potenciales de estos ataques son los seres humanos, los cultivos de alimentos y el ganado. 

René Herrera, doctor en Biología e investigador de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida (FIU), comenta que un arma biológica puede ser un sin número de elementos, es decir, una cepa de bacteria, un tipo de virus o hasta hongos. El experto indica que cualquier componente que tenga una etapa de vida en el microbio en forma de esporas resistentes al ambiente se puede dispersar fácilmente y causar un daño incalculable. Es un arma intangible bastante difícil de percibir, ya que es materia microscópica que sólo se detecta al infectar al cuerpo humano. 

Herrera está convencido de que en los Estados Unidos puede haber un ataque bioterrorista. 

"Lamentablemente un país nunca estará lo suficientemente preparado como para enfrentar una crisis de esta magnitud", afirma. Herrera también considera que para evitar la catástrofe la única salida es contar con un servicio de inteligencia superior para tratar de predecir la amenaza. 

A su juicio, la Florida es uno de los estados más vulnerables en la detección de este tipo de problemas. La cantidad de inmigrantes y la integración de una comunidad bastante heterogénea complican la comprobación de la infiltración de grupos terroristas. Herrera dice que tratar con una población turista, prácticamente flotante, en donde existe desinformación y desinterés también afecta el trabajo de inteligencia. 

Otro dilema que posiblemente mucha gente desconozca, asegura Herrera, es que los virus utilizados como armas biológicas tienen un largo período de vida. El virus esta silente o durmiente esperando infectar a un individuo. 

"Una persona puede estar contagiada sin saberlo. Los síntomas son iguales a los de un catarro común y pueden ser confundidos con el malestar corporal, dolor de cabeza y cansancio, pero su evolución puede ser mortal", indica.    

Con respecto a la posibilidad de un contagio masivo, Herrera explica que el problema radica en el tipo de microbio que disemina la infección. Inicialmente, puede haber sólo una persona infectada, pero puede contagiar a miles y miles de individuos de una manera exponencial. Estas enfermedades de rápida diseminación requieren de sistemas de vigilancia inmediatos para impedir un brote epidémico.

Hay varios microorganismos considerados lo suficientemente peligrosos como para ameritar preparativos por parte de los sistemas de salud pública. Estas bacterias son: el Bacillus anthracis (el ántrax o carbunco bacteriano), la viruela, el Yersinia pestis (la peste) y los virus que provocan fiebre hemorrágica.

Igualmente, existen varios casos de armas biológicas de contaminación con carbunco o ántrax, los cuales, en su momento, trastornaron las operaciones normales de los servicios de salud pública. Herrera sostiene que el carbunco o ántrax es un microbio fácil de reproducir y muy económico. Considera que es uno de los más efectivos ya que es factible de distribuir a gran escala. 

	Un virus que se suponía erradicado desde hace más de 40 años es el de la viruela. Ante las alarmas de su posible uso, el Centro de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades, organismo perteneciente al Departamento de Salud, confirma que Estados Unidos tiene suficiente acopio de vacunas contra la viruela para aplicar a todos los que pudieran necesitarla en caso de emergencia. 

"El problema de la bacteria de la viruela es que aún no se ha perfeccionado la vacuna y por tanto no es recomendable utilizarla", dice Herrera.  

Se repite la historia

El uso de armas biológicas no es una nueva estrategia bélica. Su origen se remonta, según la historia universal, a la época clásica y durante la dominación romana. 

Los ejércitos tenían especialistas en envenenar las fuentes de agua potable de las que se abastecían las ciudades e, incluso, en algunas ocasiones llegaron a introducir enfermedades como cólera, peste o lepra para someter a la población. 

Este procedimiento militar volvió a emplearse durante los siglos XV al XVIII, en que los colonos europeos aniquilaron a poblaciones enteras de nativos de los otros continentes, de forma voluntaria e involuntaria, al introducir la sífilis, la gripe, la viruela o el tifus.

Tras el uso intensivo de las armas químicas durante la Primera Guerra Mundial, durante la Segunda también se hicieron algunos intentos de usar armas biológicas. Después de 30 años, en 1972 se firmó el Acuerdo Internacional sobre Armas Biológicas que prohibía el desarrollo, la fabricación y el almacenamiento de este tipo de armamento con fines bélicos. De esta forma, a principios de la década pasada parecía que la humanidad iba a verse libre de la posibilidad de un ataque biológico.

Acciones y medidas

Es poco lo que las personas pueden hacer con anticipación para protegerse ante un posible ataque bioterrorista. Los institutos médicos y las agencias de salud pública aún no han recibido la atención adecuada ni los recursos para enfrentar desastres como el bioterrorismo.  

Herrera sostiene que a la población le interesa saber cómo enfrentar una guerra biológica. Por lo tanto, es pertinente realizar foros, transmitir programas de televisión e impartir clases de preparación para tratar de calmar a la gente. 

El problema de que los síntomas sean tan parecidos al catarro es un arma de doble filo. Por un lado, puede pasar que una persona esté contagiada con carbunco y no lo sepa. Pero podría ocurrir lo contrario: que la persona padezca un simple resfriado y crea que es algo más grave. 

"Allí es donde entra la paranoia", concluye Herrera.

Headline: FIU represented in Poetry Anthology
Author: Claudia Ortega / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
I felt like an over-zealous ninth grader the day yearbooks are handed out, running around, trying to get all the "cool kids'" signatures.  I even found mutual understanding in Lisette Mendez, who, when I asked her for an autograph, signed next to her poem the quintessential yearbook note: "Have a great summer and see you in the fall."

The inaugural event of the FLA/BRA 2003 festival, held by Tigertail Productions on Tuesday night, had just finished and poets, poetry-lovers and passers-by roamed the Books &Books courtyard talking, laughing, giving and receiving autographs. 

Crowded into the small west wing of the store a few minutes before, 12 poets had read selections from the first (but definitely not the last!) book of South Florida poetry, "Tigertail, A South Florida Poetry Annual."

The book is a compilation of poetry from 20 different poets in the South Florida area. Although you may not think of FIU as a bastion of poetry, the importance and influence of FIU's creative program on the poetry scene can be noted in the back of the book, where FIU makes an appearance in the list of contributors six times:  four poets - Denise Duhamel, Jeffrey Knapp, Jay Snodgrass and Debra Woolley - are professors and two more - Elisa Albo and Hugo Rodriguez - are alumni.  

The editor chosen by Tigertail was Campbell McGrath, an assistant professor in the creative writing program at BBC. So, maybe it's not a coincidence that so many poets are in some way affiliated to FIU, but regardless of how they got in the book, they are each representative of South Florida's poetry scene. And, of course, it doesn't hurt FIU's image to have such a large representation in this anthology.

For those who might feel the selection is unfair, Tigertail Productions plans on publishing a new edition every year, with a rotating editor, so that, in the words of Mary Luft, the founder and director of Tigertail, "various points of view [are allowed] to surface; viewpoints that reflect facets of our community and Miami's cultural diversity."

McGrath, who has published five books of poetry and won numerous awards, in addition to receiving accolades from critics in publications like The New Yorker, admits that the selection is subjective and that it does not embody all of the "local poetic enterprise."  But in light of what Luft said, that's the beauty of this publication; since it will come out every year, the subjectivity of the editor might actually be a good thing.  

As far as the possible complaint that some of the poets aren't native Floridians, McGrath writes in his introduction, "But even as their poetry testifies to the complete individuality of experience, it also demonstrates the power of language to forge, from that diversity, a communal realm."  

A number of the poets are younger than might be expected; McGrath wanted to give them an opportunity and a forum from which to be heard.  His selection also brought a diverse experience to the stage; reading the poetry on paper is one thing, but to be able to hear the poets read their own work the way they envisioned it is another, and they all proved to have a unique voice.  

Of the 12 that read, no two poets sounded alike.  From Adrian Castro's sing-song reading of "To the Rhythm Family Que Es Olodum (Brazil)," to Jay Snodgrass' light-hearted "Prescriptions," which he read after running in late, and making everyone laugh, to Geoffrey Philp's solemn intonation of "everglades litany," each poet showcased their talent with originality.

"Projects don't start without a need," was Luft's opening statement that night; as one of the project directors added, the only other South Florida anthology before this one was the two issue "Palmetto Review," 18 years ago.  Happily, Tigertail has now started what will hopefully one day become a tradition, and with McGrath's help, FIU's poets are a major part of it.  Luft ended her opening speech with an unwavering, definitive remark: "South Florida is going to be known for poetry."

If you'd like a copy of the current anthology of South Florida poetry, you can go to Books and Books, or log on to Tigertail Production's website, www.tigertail.org, for more information on the book and the rest of the FLA/BRA festival events.  

So remember, next year, when the second edition comes out, you too can reenact your high school days chasing down the cool kids for signatures.

Headline: War themed Tears of the Sun released with perfect timing
Author: Joe Martel, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Quite often, people will mention that the real world is nothing like it is in the movies. I only wish that were true in this case, then I would sleep better knowing the savagery and brutality depicted in this movie was simply a work of twisted fiction. In "Tears of the Sun," director Antoine Fugua ("Training Day") shows us both the horrifying cruelty and the noble compassion of the human heart.

Nigeria, Africa: a nation in turmoil, a nation still plagued by constant tribal warfare. So many factions and religious groups at each others' throats are threatening the stability of the region. The current democratic government has just been overthrown by a ruthless military dictator. 

The newly deposed President and his entire family have been executed, leaving no heir to reclaim the throne. Ethnic cleansings are becoming more and more rampant: the Islamic rebels of the North butchering the Christians of the South. Stability as we know it has just collapsed.

Fresh from an assignment, Lt. A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) and his elite team of Navy SEALs are immediately ordered back into the field. Their new assignment: to retrieve Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci/"Brotherhood of the Wolf"), an American missionary doctor from a remote village deep in the Nigerian jungle. 

These guys are really good at making an entrance. I, for one, would never try sky-diving at night. When they arrive at their destination and confront Dr. Kendricks, they are suddenly faced with an interesting problem. She refuses to leave her patients behind. If they stay, they will be killed by the rebels. The only way she'll go voluntarily is if they come as well - all seventy of them. 

Waters is a good soldier who has never disobeyed orders and he is under strict of orders to retrieve the Doctor. So, naturally, they have a problem. He plays along at first leading them through the jungle to salvation, and nearly abandons them, but after witnessing the barbarism of their enemy, he starts to listen to the better angels of his nature. 

His team now has a new mission: to escort them safely to Cameroon. On the way, Waters finds out that hundreds of rebel soldiers are on their trail. This leads him to believe that these refugees are a bit more important than they appear to be.

With the current dilemma of America's decision to go to war, some might consider this film to be propaganda. Whether or not it is true, "Tears of the Sun" is an excellent film and well worth watching. This is a story that had to be told, regardless of political opinions. Unfortunately, there were a few problems that kept it from being Oscar material. 

The story seems to move too fast, especially at both the beginning and the end. It starts too quickly and it ends too quickly. I also found it very annoying to see them pat themselves on the back every time someone does something remotely decent. They don't even seem sincere when they do it. 

True, it may not be as well done as "Black Hawk Down" or "Band of Brothers," but "Tears of the Sun" is good enough to make you open your eyes to the real world.

Headline: 'Hurricane' chronicles Floridian author's humorous life
Author: Felicidad Garcia, Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Have you ever felt as if your life is just too insane to be real? As if you simply had to be providing endless hours of entertainment for viewers in an alternate dimension, like your very own Truman show? Bill Murphy did, and to create order in his chaotic world, he wrote a book about it. 

A comedic memoir, "The Hurricane of My Mother & Other Likely Stories," is a compilation of several journal entry-like chapters, summing up the most impacting people and moments in Murphy's life. 

From the family dog Sam to his mother Phyllis, Murphy weaves a mix of apologetic and revealing excerpts with which to span all aspects of the human condition.

Much of "The Hurricane of My Mother & Other Likely Stories" takes place in Florida, particularly in the Keys near Marathon where his family lives. Murphy currently resides in Hollywood, Fla. and works as an English teacher. 

One of my favorite parts of the book is the title story, "The Hurricane of My Mother," where Murphy describes his experience of Hurricane Andrew while he's in Ohio, taking care of his mother who had to evacuate her Fla. Keys home. 

During the storm, Phyllis, who suffers from short-term memory loss ("Are you Bill? You need a haircut. Did I tell you that already?") is continually under the impression that the storm is actually in Ohio, causing her to say things like: "When this storm is over you better get a haircut."                   

Of course, we can all relate to the feeling that we were given the downright strangest parental unit(s) in the universe as punishment for misdeeds in a past life, and luckily, Murphy let's us know we're not alone. 

That and other shorts make up the mostly humorous chapter "It's My Family and I'll Cry if I Want To."

Many of the stories run just like that one. Short, funny and usually very generous with regard to human flaws; a perfect example being "My Mother the Thief" - Murphy is always a gentleman. 

Still other stories leave you with an incomplete feeling as if you'd just watched a recent episode of a reality television show, inwardly saying "so, what?" 

As in the story "Sam," where Murphy tells the tale of his family dog, who often made himself the star magician in a long-term disappearing act. Sam would vacation just long enough so that everyone lost hope of ever finding him and would then suddenly reappear casually sunbathing on the driveway.

 The odd thing about this story is that it seemed to me to have launched off the perfect comedic platform of animals, magic and quirky family. 

Unfortunately, somewhere along the way Murphy's sentiment got to the better of his writing skills, and the story inevitably dragged (which is amazing considering it's only two pages long) and ended blandly. 

But as I said earlier, most entries are funny, and also, one of the best characteristics of this book is the fact that each story is usually no more than four pages long.

 In addition, the tales stand completely independent of each other; a point which caters to those who can't devote a continuous amount of attention and time to a novel but could use something to read while in a waiting room or another equally time-wasting situation. 

Murphy succeeds in pulling together different stories that all offer a light-hearted view of work, friends and family and that, thanks to their brevity, can be enjoyed on a minute- to-minute basis. 

Got a minute? You can spend it reading "A Day at the Beach" and quickly relate to the cumbersome feeling of dragging along what feels like your entire house across the sand on a hot day meant for fun and relaxation.

Murphy's writing may not be the most riveting, but it's worth skimming through at the very least. 

I don't know how else to explain "The Hurricane of My Mother & Other Likely Stories" except that it's like kind of like fruit punch. It's fruity and sweet, but this book could have used a little more punch.

Headline: 'Project Refuel' to raise donations for needy
Author: Nina Munizaga, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Dancers from across Miami-Dade county will unite for a humanitarian cause: to fight hunger. "Project Refuel: Dance for Food" will take place on Sunday, April 13 at 2 p.m. at the Roxy Performing Arts Center. All funds collected at the event will be donated to organizations that help the hungry.

"It's about righteousness, generosity and art," said Julie Colombino, a senior dancer at FIU and founder of the event. 

The idea for the concert, which was inspired by a photograph of a starving African child, is to educate, inform and motivate the community.

The benefit features well-known artists in the dance world including the Isadora Duncan Dance Ensemble and Momentum Dance Company, among others. From ballet to modern, tap to afro-modern, the project aims to provide education about starvation and use the power of movement to make a positive impact on society.

A reception will be held afterward, in which a live band will play, and food and drinks will be served. Admission is $10 plus two cans of food for students with ID and $15 plus two cans of food for all others.

In order to create an experience and not just a concert, the FIU Dance program's "building community through the arts" class, taught by associate professor of dance Leslie Neal, will set up an educational room for viewers. The room will be filled with facts, statistics and information on poverty and starvation in the United States and other countries worldwide. 

"We're setting up the room so people don't forget why they paid, and why we're all there," Colombino said. 

This "miracle project," according to Colombino, was made possible by generous donations not only from individuals, but also from organizations wanting to help the cause, such as FIU's Women's Studies Student Organization, Student Dance Organization and the Student Organization Committee.

"People have been overly generous, it's been completely overwhelming for me," Colombino said. 

With the arduous goal of restoring faith in the cynic, hope in the desperate and trust in the skeptic, "Project Refuel" aims to make more than just a buzz.

"Some of us still want to make a difference in the world, despite global conflicts," Colombino said. As a result, all food poundage will be given to the Daily Food Bank of Miami-Dade in order to feed the hungry and homeless in South Florida. All monetary proceeds will be donated to Father Philip H. Mbeta, of the Blantyre Archdiocese in Africa, to directly aid the starving people of Malawi, Africa. Money donated to the African Archdiocese will go toward building better technologies for African workers, particularly a steel water tank and a maiz mill for farm laborers.

"I didn't want to feed people for just one day," said Colombino. "That's a band-aid." 

The project has raised over $3,000 already, and hopes to raise more before the performance in April.

 "This is our chance as dancers to show our peace effort during tense times," Colombino said. "People do want to help. All I did was throw out an idea."

&nbsp;
"Así Yavé los dispersó sobre la superficie de la tierra y dejaron de construir la ciudad. Por eso se la llamó Babel, porque allí Yavé confundió el lenguaje de todos los habitantes y desde allí los dispersó".

Y fue así como comenzamos cada cual a hablar una jeringonza distinta, a pararnos sobre nuestros pies y comenzar a hacer camino. En ese camino cruzamos océanos, ríos, piedras hasta que, con el pasar de los siglos y gobiernos, terminamos por decreto de algún dios en Miami. 

Y es que donde comienza Miami termina Estados Unidos y el territorio se convierte en un popurrí de acentos, expresiones y gustos. El tiempo no ha quitado la confusión causada por Yavé, sino que seguimos mirándonos muchas veces con caras de asombro cuando nos comunicamos, incluso en el mismo idioma. 

Muchas veces es como si cada uno hablara un español distinto. Cada país tiene sus expresiones peculiares que otra cultura, igualmente hispana, no entiende. Algunas mentes recién llegadas a esta ciudad no comprenden qué quiere decir: "acere, que volá". Se miran la espalda buscando alas para salir volando cual Icaros modernos. Otras quedan impactadas ante un venezolano que exclama: "¡pero tú me estás mamando gallo!" La imagen mental de esta expresión resulta ofensiva para los amantes del gallito de Kellogg's.

A estas frases se pueden añadir otras. La lista sería infinita, cargada, claro está, de risas y malos entendidos. A veces el golpe cultural te puede resultar en una total odisea, sobre todo si quieres conseguir información en Little Haiti y no sabes ni pizca de creole. Pero, qué es la experiencia de vivir fuera de tu país sino una aventura llena de anécdotas graciosas y otras no tanto. 

La vida, dicen algunos, se vive mejor con una maleta. La de cada estudiante que pisa una universidad extranjera se llena de historias que contaremos a nuestros nietos en tardes aburridas. Muchos guardaremos un amigo incondicional, un amante pasajero, un chiste, alguna que otra enseñanza de profesor. Y por qué no una que otra palabra o frase del "Diccionario Universitario Post-FIU".

Headline: Comunidad de San Isidro sigue viva
Subheadline: Sandra Velasco
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;

Son las 11:30 a.m. en Pompano Beach, Florida. La iglesia católica de San Isidro se prepara para la misa en español del domingo. La unidad móvil de Verbo y Vida alista todo su equipo para la emisión en directo. Los últimos feligreses entran afanados buscando sillas. La misa dura aproximadamente una hora y 45 minutos. 

Dentro de la iglesia, el coro acompaña a la voz principal, un colombiano que anima a los fervorosos fieles a cantar con él y a estrechar las manos de los demás. Un hombre y varias jovencitas vestidos con túnicas blancas de satín ondean banderas verdes a lo largo de los corredores. La puerta principal se abre y entra el padre Alberto Cutié, seguido de una docena de monaguillos de ambos sexos que traen consigo los elementos de la liturgia. Las cuatro cámaras del canal siguen todos los detalles. "Grabando, cinco, cuatro, tres, dos..."

El padre Alberto, conocido por su columna en El Nuevo Herald, su desaparecido talk-show en Telemundo y su programa en Radio Paz, es ahora el sacerdote encargado de San Isidro. 

"Es temporal, el párroco de esta iglesia sigue siendo el padre Ricardo Castellanos. Yo soy el administrador y oficio las misas mientras se resuelve todo", afirma el religioso.

Lo que tiene que resolverse es el caso de las demandas pendientes del padre Castellanos ante la corte de Miami-Dade. 

Todo comenzó cuando la familia de Miguel Chinchilla, un monaguillo que trabajó en la iglesia Little Flower en Coral Gables entre 1974 y 1977, demandó penalmente el año pasado a los sacerdotes Ricardo Castellanos y Álvaro Guichard por abuso sexual. Seguidamente, José Albino Curráis, quien conoció a Castellanos y a Guichard en 1970, también demandó penalmente a los dos sacerdotes.

El año pasado, después de las demandas presentadas en la Arquidiócesis de Boston por delitos sexuales que implicaban a varios sacerdotes pederastas, la familia Chinchilla y José Curráis revivieron lo que creían enterrado. Alentados por un abogado especialista en este tipo de casos, decidieron demandar penalmente a los dos sacerdotes que presuntamente abusaron de Miguel y José.

Desafortunadamente para los devotos de la iglesia católica de San Isidro, la acusación se formuló contra su pastor, el sacerdote Ricardo Castellanos. La Arquidiócesis de Miami decidió retirar de sus funciones a los dos padres hasta que la corte dicte su veredicto. Castellanos adelantaba desde 1986 un proyecto de evangelización internacional denominado Verbo y Vida a través de los medios de comunicación, y, hasta el momento de la demanda, era el líder espiritual de millones de católicos seguidores de su palabra.

Para Cutié y la comunidad católica de San Isidro ha sido muy doloroso todo lo que ha pasado a raíz de la demanda. 

"Los padres Castellanos y Guichard son muy queridos en esta comunidad. La acusación es grave porque un sacerdote no es capaz de abusar de un niño, ningún ser humano saludable es capaz de hacerlo. Pero este tiempo es de búsqueda de la verdad, tenemos que escuchar los dos lados antes de juzgar", afirma Cutié.

Un caso complejo

Recientemente, el juez de circuito Ronald Friedman rechazó el argumento de la iglesia católica de que el estatuto de limitaciones había caducado años atrás. 

Por lo tanto, el caso de Chinchilla sigue vigente y será juzgado como cualquier otro de su misma naturaleza. 

"Se equivocan algunos periodistas al decir que la Iglesia encubre a los sacerdotes. Pero la Iglesia también tiene que creerle a un hombre que le ha dedicado su vida a Dios, que ha tenido una formación de años y que ha trabajado mucho tiempo levantando comunidades", asegura Cutié.

En 1993, los periodistas Elinor Burkett y Frank Bruni publicaron el libro A Gospel of Shame ("Un evangelio de verguenza"), el cual aborda el caso de Chinchilla y nombra a los sacerdotes Castellanos y Guichard en uno de sus capítulos. 

Cutié dice que en ese libro le hacen una acusación muy seria a Castellanos, que el que lo acusa está muerto y que ya lo estaba cuando se publicó el libro.

Según Cutié, Chinchilla fue a la iglesia antes de su muerte, y en un vídeo sale diciéndoles al arzobispo y a sus delegados que Castellanos no lo tocó. 

"No he visto la cinta, incluso, no sé quién la tiene. Pero creo que él (Chinchilla) levantó esa calumnia porque estaba viviendo un tiempo de crisis personal emocional. Dijo que acusó al padre pero que era falso. Los que están acusando al padre ahora son los familiares de la persona que dice que el padre no lo tocó", dice Cutié.

Del caso de Castellanos se ha dicho mucho, sobre todo por ser un personaje importante en la comunidad católica del sur de la Florida. Una de las pruebas a su favor es la existencia de un documento escrito por Miguel antes de morir. 

"En este caso en particular existe un affidavit (declaración jurada) firmado por el acusador, en donde dice que el padre Ricardo es inocente", dice Cutié.

Aún falta mucho para que concluya esta historia, en la que tantas personas y contradicciones están involucradas. Pero, mientras tanto, la iglesia de San Isidro se mantiene viva. Cada día son miles de católicos los que visitan sus instalaciones, asisten a sus eucaristías en inglés y en español, frecuentan sus grupos de oración y siguen sus seminarios. 

"Es increíble, la devoción y la fe siguen intactas. A todos nos ha afectado lo que le está pasando al padre Ricardo. Pero la gente lo quiere mucho y le está ayudando hasta económicamente para que pueda pagarse  su defensa. Yo conocí al padre desde los 15 años, lo vi trabajar con jóvenes, puedes preguntarles y te dirán que nunca los tocó", concluye Cutié.

¿Culpables o inocentes?

Alberto Ferreira trabaja voluntariamente en el ministerio de la eucaristía en San Isidro. Su hijo David es un monaguillo de 19 años que colabora en las misas de los fines de semana y trabajó junto a Castellanos durante mucho tiempo. 

"Conocemos al padre Ricardo desde hace 14 años y creemos ciegamente en su inocencia", dice Ferreira. David afirma lo mismo y asegura que el padre siempre tuvo un comportamiento intachable con él y con los demás muchachos.

Guichard y Castellanos tienen prohibido ejercer como sacerdotes, no pueden llevar sotana y no pueden hablar con nadie con respecto a las demandas. Al tratar de contactar a Castellanos por teléfono, correo electrónico o carta, responde una señora identificada como "Cristina". Ella insiste en que el padre no puede hablar con nadie y menos conceder entrevistas para periodistas. Afirma que ningún periodista católico debería escribir acerca del caso y que el padre Cutié no sabe nada y no debería conceder entrevistas.

La eucaristía en español del domingo ha terminado, los fieles se agolpan emocionados en el atrio de la iglesia para saludar a Cutié, quien pacientemente estrecha las manos de todos los que se le acercan. El ambiente es de alegría. Por unas horas la gente olvida las demandas que pesan en contra de uno de los líderes más respetados de la iglesia católica. Un caso que no se ha acabado de escribir y que, seguramente, cambiará la historia de la iglesia católica en el mundo.

La preocupación general de la población por un potencial ataque con armas biológicas aumentó después de los golpes terroristas del 11 de septiembre de 2001, según el Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Los principales institutos y centros de estudios biológicos reciben constantes llamadas de personas que buscan información acerca del bioterrorismo, qué son las armas biológicas, cuál es su alcance y qué medidas pueden tomar para protegerse. 

La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), al igual que otros organismos internacionales y nacionales, participa en la investigación sobre las armas biológicas. La OMS las define como: "instrumentos utilizados intencionalmente para causar enfermedades o muertes por medio de la propagación de microorganismos o toxinas a través de alimentos, agua, insectos o en forma de aerosol".

Asimismo, la OMS destaca que los objetivos potenciales de estos ataques son los seres humanos, los cultivos de alimentos y el ganado. 

René Herrera, doctor en Biología e investigador de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida (FIU), comenta que un arma biológica puede ser un sin número de elementos, es decir, una cepa de bacteria, un tipo de virus o hasta hongos. El experto indica que cualquier componente que tenga una etapa de vida en el microbio en forma de esporas resistentes al ambiente se puede dispersar fácilmente y causar un daño incalculable. Es un arma intangible bastante difícil de percibir, ya que es materia microscópica que sólo se detecta al infectar al cuerpo humano. 

Herrera está convencido de que en los Estados Unidos puede haber un ataque bioterrorista. 

"Lamentablemente un país nunca estará lo suficientemente preparado como para enfrentar una crisis de esta magnitud", afirma. Herrera también considera que para evitar la catástrofe la única salida es contar con un servicio de inteligencia superior para tratar de predecir la amenaza. 

A su juicio, la Florida es uno de los estados más vulnerables en la detección de este tipo de problemas. La cantidad de inmigrantes y la integración de una comunidad bastante heterogénea complican la comprobación de la infiltración de grupos terroristas. Herrera dice que tratar con una población turista, prácticamente flotante, en donde existe desinformación y desinterés también afecta el trabajo de inteligencia. 

Otro dilema que posiblemente mucha gente desconozca, asegura Herrera, es que los virus utilizados como armas biológicas tienen un largo período de vida. El virus esta silente o durmiente esperando infectar a un individuo. 

"Una persona puede estar contagiada sin saberlo. Los síntomas son iguales a los de un catarro común y pueden ser confundidos con el malestar corporal, dolor de cabeza y cansancio, pero su evolución puede ser mortal", indica.    

Con respecto a la posibilidad de un contagio masivo, Herrera explica que el problema radica en el tipo de microbio que disemina la infección. Inicialmente, puede haber sólo una persona infectada, pero puede contagiar a miles y miles de individuos de una manera exponencial. Estas enfermedades de rápida diseminación requieren de sistemas de vigilancia inmediatos para impedir un brote epidémico.

Hay varios microorganismos considerados lo suficientemente peligrosos como para ameritar preparativos por parte de los sistemas de salud pública. Estas bacterias son: el Bacillus anthracis (el ántrax o carbunco bacteriano), la viruela, el Yersinia pestis (la peste) y los virus que provocan fiebre hemorrágica.

Igualmente, existen varios casos de armas biológicas de contaminación con carbunco o ántrax, los cuales, en su momento, trastornaron las operaciones normales de los servicios de salud pública. Herrera sostiene que el carbunco o ántrax es un microbio fácil de reproducir y muy económico. Considera que es uno de los más efectivos ya que es factible de distribuir a gran escala. 

	Un virus que se suponía erradicado desde hace más de 40 años es el de la viruela. Ante las alarmas de su posible uso, el Centro de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades, organismo perteneciente al Departamento de Salud, confirma que Estados Unidos tiene suficiente acopio de vacunas contra la viruela para aplicar a todos los que pudieran necesitarla en caso de emergencia. 

"El problema de la bacteria de la viruela es que aún no se ha perfeccionado la vacuna y por tanto no es recomendable utilizarla", dice Herrera.  

Se repite la historia

El uso de armas biológicas no es una nueva estrategia bélica. Su origen se remonta, según la historia universal, a la época clásica y durante la dominación romana. 

Los ejércitos tenían especialistas en envenenar las fuentes de agua potable de las que se abastecían las ciudades e, incluso, en algunas ocasiones llegaron a introducir enfermedades como cólera, peste o lepra para someter a la población. 

Este procedimiento militar volvió a emplearse durante los siglos XV al XVIII, en que los colonos europeos aniquilaron a poblaciones enteras de nativos de los otros continentes, de forma voluntaria e involuntaria, al introducir la sífilis, la gripe, la viruela o el tifus.

Tras el uso intensivo de las armas químicas durante la Primera Guerra Mundial, durante la Segunda también se hicieron algunos intentos de usar armas biológicas. Después de 30 años, en 1972 se firmó el Acuerdo Internacional sobre Armas Biológicas que prohibía el desarrollo, la fabricación y el almacenamiento de este tipo de armamento con fines bélicos. De esta forma, a principios de la década pasada parecía que la humanidad iba a verse libre de la posibilidad de un ataque biológico.

Acciones y medidas

Es poco lo que las personas pueden hacer con anticipación para protegerse ante un posible ataque bioterrorista. Los institutos médicos y las agencias de salud pública aún no han recibido la atención adecuada ni los recursos para enfrentar desastres como el bioterrorismo.  

Herrera sostiene que a la población le interesa saber cómo enfrentar una guerra biológica. Por lo tanto, es pertinente realizar foros, transmitir programas de televisión e impartir clases de preparación para tratar de calmar a la gente. 

El problema de que los síntomas sean tan parecidos al catarro es un arma de doble filo. Por un lado, puede pasar que una persona esté contagiada con carbunco y no lo sepa. Pero podría ocurrir lo contrario: que la persona padezca un simple resfriado y crea que es algo más grave. 

"Allí es donde entra la paranoia", concluye Herrera.
