Headline: Inter-campus bus fare increased
Author: Erika Taveras/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU students dependent on the bus services going to and from University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus, will have to fork up an additional 25 cents per bus ticket beginning Oct. 13. 

     The $500,000 yearly contract the university had with the previous bus company, Coach U.S.A., expired in January.

  FIU could not renew the contract because Coach went out of business this summer, so it was time to hire a new company. 

BTM Charters offered to step in and cater to the needs of the university, which it has been doing since the July and will continue to do pending university approval of its bid. 

Administration officials don't see the rise in fare as a problem.  

"I don't think a quarter will make an impact," William R. Foster, director of the Parking and Traffic Department, said.  

Foster said that deep cuts in the university's budget left no choice but to raise bus prices, which currently stand at one dollar per ticket per ride.  

He does not believe that the number of students using the bus service will decrease as a result of the rise in price. 

He believes students will not stop using the bus because the buses provide a wonderful commodity for those students who do not want to be stuck in traffic and others who do not own cars to begin with. 

 He also emphasized that the previous price of one dollar per ride would only cover approximately 20 percent of the actual traveling costs, which in actuality would require three or four dollars more. 

Foster said that because the buses are a service provided by the university, the last thing FIU wants is to create a hindrance by charging more to students. 

Therefore, the other coverage costs are funded by the university. Thus, he does not see 25 cents as a major discrepancy.  But some students disagree.

 "Raising bus ticket [fares] is unfair, because most college students already have tight budgets; all this is doing is giving us an extra expense," said freshman and advertising major Maricel Ruiz.  

"For instance, I migrate on the shuttle bus everyday of the week and already have to pay $10 a week. Now I will soon be paying $12.50 weekly. I will have to sacrifice the money I spend on other things like food, in order to pay for bus rides," said Ruiz.  

Ruiz said that she might stock up on the $10 weekly tickets ahead of time, to save herself money in the long run. 

Other students fear that the raise in fare is only a preview for what is later to come. 

"Now it will be an additional 50 cents for a round trip, but how about later on?" said Bayardo Garcia, a junior and advertising major.  "I fear that the fare will continue rising and the situation is only going to get worse."

Approximately 190 students ride the bus between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday according to BTM driver Gonzalo Morales. 

Morales explained that every driver has to keep count of how many students ride the bus, in order to determine if a second bus is required at any given time of day.

 In addition, all bus drivers are required to submit a bill and a log with the student count to the purchasing department.  

BTM Charters is a new company to the Miami area that started in Orlando, Fla. five years ago. 

Presently, BTM is undergoing an approval period and the university is yet to sign a contract with the company. 

The process involved in hiring a bus company is a procedure involving bids. 

The university purchasing department is responsible for acquiring the bids that qualify, and later deciding which company will obtain the contract. 

 As of now, it is uncertain if BTM Charters will have a permanent contract with FIU.

Headline: Dominican-American Student Association invites all to join
Author: Yasmine Abellard/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
What do you get when you mix the merengue beats of the Dominican Republic with a dash of authentic Dominican food in a fiesta setting at FIU? You get the Third Annual Noche Dominicana sponsored by the Dominican-American Student Association. 

This year, Noche Dominicana takes place on Oct. 14 from 7 p.m. - 9 p.m. in the Graham Center forum at the University Park campus. 

This festivity is part of Hispanic Heritage, a two-week long fiesta celebrating various Hispanic countries, while seeking to educate the university community about the differences in culture.

"Noche Dominicana is our night within the Heritage week to stand out," said DASO member, Claudia Martinez. 

For those who know nothing of the Dominican culture, Martinez said, "We're preparing a dance for you, [and] some typical food so that you can taste a little bit of our culture." 

Martinez adds that visitors can expect anything from yucca, rice and beans, to traditional Dominican dishes such as habichuelas, sancocho, and morir so√±ando. 

There are also ways to find out about the hot vacation spots. Just in case you may want to visit Dominican Republic in the future, there will also be a venue providing tourism information.  

DASO, founded in 2000 by then-President Octavio Miguel Hueda, was established because, "He [Hueda] felt there were so many Dominicans here, and there was not a unity amongst them," said current President Gisett Taveras.

Taveras, who became a member in 2000, says that DASO has served as a support system for her.

"Sometimes, when you come to a new school, you don't know anybody," she said. "[But] if you're Dominican for example, and if you're in DASO, [then] you have a group of people you have common things with; it makes it easier."

Although the 3-year-old club, which has 60 club members, primarily targeted Dominican students, Taveras said, "We have plenty of students that are not Dominican, [or] they like Dominicans, or they have Dominican friends, or boyfriends or girlfriends, and they join." 

Don't be afraid if you have no Latin blood, or don't even speak Spanish. Taveras said everyone is welcome to join DOSA. 

"I always tell people join; we don't discriminate," she said with enthusiasm.

DASO started out as a community-based organization. 

They began showcasing art exhibits, donating books, and focusing mostly on charity work. 

There more recent events include food and clothes drive collected for victims of the earthquake that rocked the Dominican Republic on Sept. 22. 

Now, DASO is shifting its focus towards its students by providing them with various leadership workshops and aiding them in forming professional contacts within the community.

DASO also hopes to establish a film forum next semester, showing several movies that seek to not only to inform others of their culture. They also want to break stereotypes often thought of as the Dominican way of life. 

While DASO's goal is to promote awareness of the Dominican culture through educational and cultural activities, it definitely believes in disfrutando la vida, as Taveras exclaimed, "we all like to party!" For more information on how to join DASO, please contact Gisett Taveras at dasofiu@yahoo.com.

Headline: FIU rows in Indian Creek Regatta
Author: Francisco Zuniga/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's rowing club competed in the "Indian Creek Regatta," South Florida's biggest rowing competition of the year on Oct. 12.

"This big competition you see here, this is about the biggest one in South Florida," said Sid Mckay, coach of FIU's rowing team. 

The races were held at the Shane Water Sports Center in Miami Beach. The event began at eight in the morning and went on until noon. Coca Cola, The Miami Beach Rowing Club, Comfort Inn, and others sponsored the event. Aside from FIU, other schools participating were Barry University, U.M., U.F., and the University of Tampa. Independent boating clubs were also involved. 

The race was composed of fourteen events ranging from single to eight person boats. The teams were divided into women's, men's and mixed. Of the fourteen events, FIU participated in four: Women's 8, men's single, men's 8, and the mixed 8. Team member Henry Kupczyck won the silver metal for reaching second place in the Men's single.

"I thought I was going to win this year. I placed second and third the last three or four years," said Kupczyck, explaining that there was another competitor in his race who was faster.

 Kupczyck has been in the club for the last six years. He is captain of the men's team and assists Mckay in coaching and managing the club.

The women's 8 came in 7th place, men's 8 made 2nd place with a one minute difference against U.M., and the mixed 8 finished in 22 minutes. The winners of the competition receive medals and recognition. But the team members said they participate for the fun of it.

Training for this competition began at the beginning of the fall semester.

"They started rowing at the commencement of term. Most of them started rowing August or September," said Mckay.

FIU's rowing club has a regular training schedule that ranges from three to four days a week. 

"Our schedule is Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from four to six, and Saturday mornings," said Sarah Hammill, librarian at the BBC campus, faculty advisor, and member of the rowing club.

Hammill went on to explain that anyone can join the club. The only requirements are to know how to swim, and consistency in attending practice. The club hopes to one day ascend to a sport, and Mckay is looking to make the women's team varsity. 

Funding is also a concern for the members of the rowing club. They hope to receive more help from FIU administration.

"From what I understand it seems that the administration is sort of dragging their feet, and I think part is because we're at north campus," said club member, and junior Nick Duroch.

This race was the FIU rowing club's first event of the year. They will be competing again in December at the Regatta at Barth Club.

Headline: All bark, no bite; Bush falls flat on Cuba policy
Author: Andy Diaz/ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Last week, when President Bush gave his speech about Cuba at the White House Rose Garden on Oct. 10, the 135th anniversary of El Grito de Yara, the Cuban version of the Declaration of Independence, I had no expectation that the president would unveil a plan slightly different from the de facto American policy towards the island of the last 40 years.

 The president, in his best faux cold warrior, "tough on this, war on that" demeanor, promised to strengthen restrictions against Cuba to appease the restless factions within the Cuban exile community who had recently spoken publicly against Bush's lethargic stance on Fidel Castro and his lack of "tough on this, war on that" speeches aimed at the dictator.

Considering for a second that the embargo stance against Cuba has the remotest possibility of being successful at dethroning the most oppressive dictator our hemisphere has known - who has kept my people enslaved for over four decades - Bush's speech gave no reason for the Cuban community to be appeased. 

In essence, all Bush did was reiterate his supposed commitment to retrograde laws that were in one way or another passed because of his predecessor's unrelenting lust for political gain. 

The Cuban Democracy Act, popularly known as the Toricelli Bill, was forced upon George Bush's reluctant desk by Clinton's support of it on the campaign trail and several speeches about it in Miami cafeterias. The bill was sponsored by Democrat Congressman Robert Toricelli, who only four years before had visited the island and commented on it with an idiocy beyond belief: "living standards are not high, but the homeless, hunger and disease that is witnessed in much of Latin America does not appear evident," and godfathered by the head of the Cuban American National Foundation, Jorge Mas Canosa. 

Clinton's political erudition did not falter him four years later, during his re-election campaign, when months before the election he signed the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, or the Helms-Burton bill, which strengthened the embargo and made it impossible for any president to suspend it without an act of Congress. Clinton won the overwhelmingly Republican exile vote that election by 70 percent.

This assumes that the embargo, and any breakaway policy thereof, works, which 40 years have shown otherwise.

Castro always struck me as the worst extreme of the Quixotic figure. His regime is a complete failure so he is forced to make monsters out of windmills to blame his numerous shortcomings on. It is tragic that the embargo and the American government have given him the ideal windmills.

I spoke briefly to Ann Louise Bardach, author of the recent book "Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana," about six months right before her excellent book was about to come out in paperback - she dedicated my hardcover copy on Oct. 10 last year and included a reference to the date's aforementioned significance. 

As she sped off to a meeting with the members of the Cuban American National Foundation, she said in passing, "something's got to change because Castro is not going to die." There's an underlying truth in Bardach's statement.

While Castro may one day die - every sensible Cuban hopes it happens in the next 10 minutes - it might not happen within the next four years, which is what every American president has planned for, so that if Castro were to die during their term, Cuba's consequent change would be attributed to their "tough on this, war on that" policy towards the communist regime. 

It is essentially the argument made by Reagan supporters who ignorantly claim he brought the evil empire down single-handedly without ever stopping to consider that perhaps the Soviet system was intrinsically flawed and its people became fed up with oppression. 

Look at the Reaganistas' argument this way, the president stood in West Berlin and said, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!" and in Biblical fashion the wall immediately came tumbling down.

After 40 years of a failed embargo, the only remaining option is engagement. This isn't anything too radical. It's been tried before with some success. Henry Kissinger, who admittedly is one of the more nefarious characters American politics have every known, tried his successful Chinese model of engagement with Cuba during the Ford administration. 

It was taken one step further during the Carter administration, when talks brought Castro to landmark concessions: the release of over 3,500 political prisoners and a dozen American prisoners of the regime, and the grant of exit visas for Cubans to migrate to the United States to reunite with family members. 

This is chronicled succinctly in another recent book, "Secret Missions to Cuba: Fidel Castro, Bernardo Benes, and Cuban Miami" by the director of the University of Miami's Center for Latin American Studies, Robert M. Levine. 

All these achievements were reversed when 12 Cubans drove a bus through the gates of the Peruvian embassy in Havana seeking asylum, and Castro, threatened by political unrest within the island, unleashed the Mariel boatlift.

The present administration can learn a lot from the mistakes and the successes of the past but yet it refuses to. It has shown that it is willing to follow a safe political path based upon ideology instead of empirical research.

Headline: California recall a joke
Author: John Colagrande Jr./ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
This Arnold Schwarzenegger thing, it's bulls--t. For real. It's sickening, deplorable, unjust.

Governor Gray Davis won the general election less than a year ago. He won the election less than a year ago. Why is he out of office?  He didn't do anything. He did nothing wrong. 

Why did they impeach him?

A rich Republican from San Diego, Darrell Issa, he started the campaign to get enough signatures, two million, to hold a recall election. 

Issa, for one, is a criminal, and two, he paid people commision to get their signatures. These guys are sofa kings. Sofa king dirty.

Who do these Republicans think they are? They steal elections. They don't care that we live in a democracy where the leaders are elected by the people. If the Republican party doesn't get the results they want they'll just go ahead and steal the power. 

Why? Because they have the money.

How stupid are the citizens of California? There is nothing good about Schwarzenegger. People think he's straight 'cause he's a movie star. 

Get real. He represents big business and corporations, the man is bought and paid for.

He came in there and stole the election despite having no experience and really no clear-cut agenda of his own. He'll appoint some rich bigwig to do all the work. He won because he spent a load of money on a load of commercials before the election. 

Where did he get the money? 

There is a limit to how much cash a voter can contribute to a campaign. Schwarzenegger bypassed that law by seeking out millions of dollars of private "loans" from businessmen, the "loans" he said would be paid back once in office. 

What's the difference between a campaign contribution and a "loan" when you intend on paying back the loans with political favors? Arnold Schwarzenegger is another sofa king.

It really is illegal how the Republicans stole that election.

Because this fiasco happened in California, does it affect us? 

It affects us in that we need to see through the dirty games these people play. It's getting out of control.

The Democrats should get another two million votes for another recall and this time pit a celebrity against Schwarzenegger, like Tim Robbins or Warren Beatty. 

But the Democrats won't do it. They won't fight.

Headline: Golf carts' shortcuts ruin UP landscape
Author: Felicidad Garcia / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Since moving on campus, I have grown to have a greater appreciation and pride for FIU. This had led me to involuntarily take keen observation of the University Park campus, where I live, as if the grounds were the floors to my very own room.

Like socks strewn in the middle of my dorm, I notice litter and duck poo at FIU like never before. 

Now, I'm not going to lie, my room looks, well, "lived in," to say the least. But then again, I don't pay for anyone to come and clean up after me (not that I could if I wanted to.) 

I do however, pay for the maintenance and landscaping here at UP on some level, I'm sure. And something has come to my attention enough times to be worthy of my speaking up. For all the money spent on our beautiful landscape for watering, cutting grass, planting new trees and general maintenance, why is it then being destroyed? 

I'm talking about the golf carts.

I've noticed there are more this year than last year, and that's great, I guess - I personally don't know for what purpose, but I trust some one "up there" does. According to the Vehicle Services Department, there are approximately 115 golf carts on campus right now.  That's about 15 more now than this time last year I'm told, with at least three more to come. 

Understandably, all these golf carts operating at the same time must find it difficult to find road or sidewalk space to manuever on, but still, the grass should not be an option. 

It seems in order to get across the campus faster, I see the carts tearing through the grass and leaving muddy trenches in their wake.

The result is gross.

And I don't mean Green-Peace-hug-a-tree-and-don't-eat-meat gross, I mean watch-out-for-the-mosquito-ridden-swamp-holes gross. The tracks are deep, too - I'm talking six inches deep in some places - and it takes a long time for the grass to grow over them again and actually walking across there is impossible because when it rains it forms stinky mud pools for days.

Don't believe me? Think I'm exaggerating? 

Just take a look at the lawn behind the PC building on the way to the residence halls, or how about next to the English Language Institute, in front of the Health and Wellness Center? 

Seriously, too much money is spent on our greenery so we can buy more golf carts and rampage the lawns with them. 

I mean, com'on, there are roads; take the not-so-scenic route.

My name is Elayne Sanchez and I am a senior. My major is Public Relations and my phone number is 305-962-3545.
Ok here's the deal.
I am always excited to see what else is the Beacon going to come up with. I love reading the newspaper because since all of my classes are at BBC, it maintains me informed of what's going on all over FIU, which seems to be at UP, but that's another issue, right?
I was reading the front page headlines and came across,'DASO offers taste of Dominican culture'; being Dominican I was automatically flipping to page four to see what they have to say about my culture. To my amazement, I find words mispelled and that completely mean something else or don't mean a thing, at least to us Dominicans.
First of all, our music is not called meringue, it's MERENGUE and we don't drink monir sonando, we drink MORIR sonando.
I didn't even finish reading the article.
Don't get me wrong, I like the Beacon and I think pretty good articles are published on every issue, but I just had to get that out of my chest. It's my culture and mistakes like that bother me. I'm sure it would bother you if similar mistakes were made in an article about your culture.
I just think more careful editing has to be done. Being a regular Beacon reader I have found similar mistakes and even gramma errors,I guess when you take the grammar test so many times, it kind of sticks to you.

Thank you,

Headline: Greeks putting fans in seats at football games
Subheadline: FIU Athletics turning to  different organizations to draw fans in
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU Athletics is doing everything it can to put fans in the seats at FIU home football games this year.

They have given away free Papa John's pizzas, hosted tailgate parties and passed out flyers promoting the team all over campus. Now they have gone one step further.

This season the Athletic Department has designated a different FIU organization to promote each home football game with hopes of getting more students at the games. One of the most successful of these groups has been the Greek organization.

During the school's game against Carson-Newman, the Greeks were asked to put people in the seats, and according to Greek Programming Board President and Panther Rage Vice President Christine Denton, the move has been a major success.

"We have had an enormous change from last year. The only game any one really attended last year was the first one. After that I attended all of them and there were barely any students," Denton said. 

"Actually, these past few games, we have even received [praise] from [head football coach] Don Strock and [Athletic Director] Rick Mello, who have written letters to the Greeks telling us we have been amazing and have done a really great job. They said we actually have students coming out, and that they see a big change."

And the Greeks have been designing all types of new ways to improve from last year's poor attendance figures in "The Cage", everything from parties to dancing to free food.

"Last year...not many students went to the football games and nobody went after the first game, so after that we [have now] created more incentives [to get students to attend]," Denton said. 

"We pass out flyers for students to attend restaurants with discounted food, we have the "Lot 6" thing before every game with dancers and free food and DJ and all that kind of stuff," Denton added.

For the game against Carson-Newman, they held a party at Chevy's, where the fraternity or sorority that drew the most students to the restaurant would get to walk onto the football field before kickoff and promote their organization. In addition, FIU athletics has offered a giant trophy to the organization that can draw the most fans.

Pi Kappa Phi, Alpha Xi Delta and Phi Mu drew the largest student turnout and were given an opportunity to walk onto the field and represent themselves.

And because of all of the effort from groups like these, FIU Athletics is gaining the fan base it desperately needs to make the jump  from Division I-AA to Division I-A, a move that would require an average of 15,000 fans at each home game.

"Last year I went to all the home football games and the difference in attendance between last year and this year is not even close. We have so many more students coming out right now, because I think of all the incentives we are coming up with are definitely making a big impression on students and making them want to come out," Denton said.

Headline: Couch potato workout takes care of daily exercise requirement
Author: Devin Rose/Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
Trying to squeeze workouts into the daily routine can be an exercise in frustration. Who has time, what with studying, parties, all those episodes of "Friends" ...

Admit it, couch potatoes: You can usually find time for your favorite TV drama or sitcom, ballgame or talk show. And with the new TV season under way, there's plenty of must-see viewing. With that in mind, we have devised and tried a workout you can do in front of the tube - heck, you don't even have to leave the couch for most of the moves.

Walter Pukala, aquatic coordinator, boot camp fitness and cycling instructor and personal trainer at Galter LifeCenter in Chicago, gave us a major boost by suggesting and demonstrating moves.

"Any kind of exercise is better than nothing," said Pukala, who was pumped about the idea of a TV workout from the get-go. "Couch potatoes get into a lazy routine and decide it's easier to just lie around and say, 'I'll work out later.' Then 20, 30 years down the line, they have to fix what's wrong with them.

"Hopefully, by having them at least do something, they'll catch the bug and want to do more."

First things first. Below you'll find the workout Pukala helped us devise to accompany "Law & Order" or any of its variations. The show is on about a squillion times a week on various channels, offering plenty of chances to work out. Read the workout over, then try your own variation on "L&O," or, if murder and mayhem don't do it for you, find your own show. 

Before starting, grab some light hand weights; nothing fancy required. (We used water bottles and Appy, a friend's Yorkshire terrier.) Also, have drinking water and a towel nearby.

Ready? Not so fast. "You don't want to start working out after lying around watching six hours of TV," Pukala said. "You don't want to stretch cold muscles. So walk around a little bit, get the blood flowing."

Also, remember to work out with fluid motions, not jerky ones, Pukala said. Maintain good posture and don't lock your joints. Take the weights slow and easy and don't work to the point of fatigue (you'd be surprised how heavy a beer can gets if it's not steadily being emptied.) Now you're ready.

Fitness instructor Walter Pukala helped us put together a routine to accompany a favorite show, "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit." We've included segment and commercial times from the hourlong episode we used to sample our workout; with a little flexibility, you can adapt our workout to your favorite show. 

Also, just for thrills (as the bad guys would say,) we threw in additional moves: Whenever someone would "lawyer up" - or, for those of you who aren't crime-show devotees, refuse to talk to the cops without an attorney present - we would do a floor pushup; whenever Detective Munch (Richard Belzer) appeared, we'd do an abdominal crunch or two; if Detective "Fin" (rapper Ice-T) ever smiled, we would drink extra water.



SEGMENT ONE (3 Min.)



This segment sets up the whole show. Someone invariably stumbles upon a dead body, and you don't want to get distracted. So go for some easy stretching. 

Leg stretch: Lie on couch sideways with legs straight. Lift top leg, wrap arm around it and pull it toward you. Hold it for a few seconds, release, then repeat a few times. On last one, alternate flexing and pointing your toes. Switch sides. (Do every exercise the same number of times on each side.) 

Neck stretch: Sitting or standing, gently roll your neck clockwise, then counterclockwise a few times. Tilt head to left and gently pull toward shoulder with left hand. Repeat on right side.



COMMERCIALS (3 Min.)


Cardio: Run in place, do jumping jacks, run an errand. Oops ... we forgot the water bottles to use as weights. Ran to the fridge and grabbed them.



SEGMENT TWO (10 Min.)



Weighlifting with cans or bottles or dogs: Do reps light and slow, 15 reps or so. Try to lift evenly on both sides. Rest a few seconds between reps. Don't just swing weights around; make your muscles, not momentum, do the work. Do bicep curls, overhead tricep curls, overhead presses, forward or to-the-side straight-armed lifts. (You've seen these a bunch; you just haven't been finding time to do them.) Having only one terrier, who refused to let us do overhead lifts, we limited our dog lifts to a few forward straight-armed lifts. Water bottles work nicely when the dog quits on you.



COMMERCIALS (4 Min.)



Cardio: We tore downstairs and put clothes and quarters in the dryers, ran back up, lifted the dog for good measure and drank some water (rehydrate often).



SEGMENT THREE (7 Min.)



Resistance exercises: If you're alone, sit on the couch, wrap a towel around one foot and pull on the towel while pushing with your foot. Keep knee slightly bent. After 10 seconds, release; repeat. Do it a few times, then switch sides. (Pukala mentioned that some people can't handle resistance and will benefit simply from lifting the leg and holding it in the air for a few seconds.) If a fellow couch potato is beside you, sit face to face on the couch, bent legs in front of you a foot or so off the couch, and press your soles against each other's and push.



COMMERCIALS (2 Min.)



Cardio: We played tug-of-war with the dog and his chew toy, ran in circles, ran to the bathroom, stopped running long enough to use it, then ran back.



SEGMENT FOUR (8 Min.)



Pushups: Do them against the wall if you're so inclined. Keeping your back straight, shoulders back and knees bent slightly, stand about a foot away from the wall. Rest your palms on the wall, fingers spread. Bend elbows and move toward the wall, then push yourself away, in slow, fluid movements.

Ab curls: Lie on your back on the couch, knees bent and hands behind your head. Using abdomen muscles, curl forward slightly. Keep neck and body aligned so you're not just jerking upward. Concentrate on having your abs do the work. Do these for a bit, then lie on your side and curl upward sideways, using your oblique, or side abdomen, muscles. Switch sides. For more oblique work, lie on your back with hands behind your head and knees bent. Move right leg so right ankle rests on top of left knee. Curl up so left elbow and right knee touch. Switch sides.



COMMERCIALS (4 Min.)



Cardio:We ran to the corner White Hen for cigarettes. (Kidding; we bought water. Really.)



SEGMENT FIVE (6 Min.)



Squats: The trick here is to keep your balance. Standing straight with feet shoulder-length apart, squat slightly, as if you're about to sit in a chair. Keep your heels on the floor, and don't let your knees go farther forward than your toes (your legs should be at a right angle). Keep your shoulders square and your gut stable and look straight ahead. Hold for just a second, then gently stand back up. Do a handful, take a 30-second rest, then do some more. 

Lunges: With legs slightly spread, lift one leg, then place it down a few feet in front of the other.

Cool down while sitting: You've worked hard, so sit back, take slow, deep breaths and watch as the bad guy squirms.

You can lie facedown on the couch with arms and legs straight, then reach as far as you can with your fingers and toes. 

Or, do it standing: Bend knees slightly, round your back and bend forward, with arms dangling. Slowly uncurl, one vertebra at a time, until you're standing straight. 

As you're uncurling, start to lift arms, so that by the time you're standing they're overhead. Reach for the sky. Now that the bad girl is finished, so are you. (Getting a workout while watching TV ... that's so easy it's practically criminal.)

The Golden Panthers looked to avenge last season's two losses to defending Sun Belt Conference Champion Western Kentucky, but failed in their attempt as FIU lost 3-0 in straight sets on Oct. 10 at EA Diddle Arena in Bowling Green, Ky.

"I was a little disappointed we didn't play in a fourth set but they [Western Kentucky] came out strong and had a lot more power than us," said head coach Cookie Stevens, whose team lost 30-22, 30-23, and 30-25.

FIU's record now drops to 10-6 for the season and an even 2-2 in Sun Belt Conference play. 

With the victory, Western Kentucky (17-5) won for the 31st straight time at home.

However, being on the road wasn't the reason the Golden Panthers lost, according to team captain Besty Moreland.

"For me, I focus on the game and don't hear anything from the crowd. As for some of my teammates, it can be a little intimidating as the crowd is pumped up... but I don't think they [Western Kentucky] have anything we don't," said Moreland, who finished the game with 31 assists.

Senior Julie Doan finished the game with 11 kills to lead FIU. Jennifer Owens added nine kills and seven blocks.

Four players who finished the match with double figures led Western Kentucky. Caron Blotch led the Lady Toppers with 50 assists. 

Tracy May finished a match high with 12 digs to become the third player for WKU to top 1,500 digs for their career. 

Stevens gave credit to the Hilltoppers, who own a 4-1 record in Sun Belt Conference play.

"They deserve credit for coming out much stronger. We had nothing working for us and needed much more strong attacks," said Stevens.

Added Moreland: "We couldn't maintain our comfort."

&nbsp;
Oct. 10- South Alabama 4, FIU 0

Things keep getting worse for the FIU women's soccer team. 

The Golden Panthers had not scored a goal since Sept. 21 against UCF and were losers of four straight entering their game against South Alabama.

The scoreless trend continued as FIU fell 4-0 to the Jaguars on Oct. 10 at the FIU Soccer Complex, marking the team's fifth straight defeat.

Led by forward Tanya Allegretti, the Jaguars managed to score a goal in the fourth minute when Allegretti put in a header off a cross from teammate Heather Adamus.

Allegretti added another goal on a header assisted by a flip throw from midfielder Jennifer Beckwith. Already up 3-0, Allegretti capped the scoring by beating FIU goalkeeper Juliana Gomez along the end line in the 82nd minute.

FIU managed 15 shots, with Charissa Gingerich and Tamara Kochen leading the Golden Panthers with three shots each.

"People only see the outcome," says FIU coach Everton Edwards, refuting claims that the team is lacking in aggression. 

However, Edwards was more concerned with his players' need for practice after four players didn't practice during the week prior to the game.

But Edwards refused to blame the lack of practice as an explanation for the loss, stating that "there are no excuses."

 However, despite their disappointing 1-8 record, the coach still managed to find hope for his team. 

"We've been dealing with hard circumstances, but we're not putting our chances away." 

As a solution, he maintains that a boost in practice will ultimately give the FIU team an upper hand.

Oct. 12- UL-L 1, FIU 0

Despite outshooting the Rajin' Cajuns 9-5, FIU's streak of consecutive losses extended to a season high six games as the Golden Panthers fell to Louisiana-Lafayette 1-0 on Oct. 12 at the FIU Soccer Complex.

The team also failed to score a goal, marking the fourth straight game the Golden Panthers have been shut out.

The Cajuns lone goal came in the 28th minute when Lindsay Webb sent a free kick to Lauren Schwindt, who found space between the FIU defense and struck the ball past FIU goalkeeper Juliana Gomez.

FIU almost saw its scoreless streak vanish in the 14th minute of the game when Janet Ligouri's shot trickled past Louisiana-Lafayette goalkeeper Liza Preseault, but  her shot bounced off the left goalpost. 

FIU's Tamara Kochen suffered the same fate in the 37th minute when her shot ricocheted off the top crossbar.

Ligouri led the Golden Panthers (1-9) with three shots on goal. The Rajin' Cajuns improved to 5-7-1 with the conference victory.

FIU will look to get the scoring going this week against Bucknell on Oct. 14 at home.

Bucknell defeated South Alabama 3-2 on Oct. 12.

Author: Harry Coleman/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With a 4-2 victory over ninth-ranked Hartwick, FIU  extended its winning streak to four in a row.

Because it was a conference game, the victory was important for Coach Karl Kremser and his team.

"We want to win the conference because the winner receives an automatic berth into the NCAA Championship," said Kremser whose team is now 7-2-1.

The first half was a hard fought battle between the two top ten teams. 

Allen Handy put the 10th ranked Golden Panthers on the scoreboard first on a chip shot from six yards out, but the Hawks kept it close and tied the score on a goal by Omar Gordon.

Fernando Plentz assisted on a pass to John Pulido to put FIU up 2-1. 

With two minutes left in the first half, Greg Victor scored for the Hawks to send the game tied at two into the half.

Pulido scored his fourth goal of the year, and he considers the victory a key one for the team.

"This was our biggest game of the entire conference and year. I give to the team. First we want to win conference, then national championship," said Pulido.

Jared Rose broke the tie just five minutes into the second half on a corner kick to put FIU up 3-2. FIU never looked back. Mark Stephenson sealed the victory in the 58th minute on a direct free kick.

Kremser is satisfied with the play of his mid-fielders and ball controllers.

"The key to the victory was the control of possession we had in the game. The second half we had 15 to 20 minutes where we played very confident. I like our chances," said Kremser.

FIU shut down the Hawks in the second half on a strong performance by goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg who had five saves and finished the game with a total of six.

Pulido noticed the performance of Rosenberg during the game. "He [Rosenberg] is the most consistent player we have on this team. He had a good game and he is out best player," said Pulido.

But Rosenberg doesn't like to take all the credit.

"I came out prepared mentally but my defense and I have a great chemistry. I give them much credit in the victory. Everyone was running out there making plays for us and this shows we want to go far," said Rosenberg.

The four goals allowed by the Hawks, equaled the amount they have allowed all season in nine games.

With the victory, FIU is now 2-2 against nationally ranked opponents. For the first time this season, FIU is ranked in the top ten in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America Adidas poll. 

The Golden Panthers are also ranked No.10 by Soccer America and No.13 by SoccerTimes.com.

Headline: Lumberjacks cut down Golden Panther defense
Subheadline: FIU fails to keep up with SFA ground game
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coming into its regionally televised primetime game with Stephen F. Austin, FIU expected something different from their opponents on offense. The thought about the Lumberjacks passing offense lingered.

But when SFA starting quarterback Zeke Dixon went down with a wrist injury at the end of last week's 21-13 loss to Portland State, things changed. 

Backup Michael Williams led SFA's offense against FIU, executing option and draw plays, responsible for a large chunk of SFA's 337 rushing yards en route to their 35-13 win over FIU at Community Stadium before 5,299 observers.

"On defense I thought we weren't competitive enough," FIU coach Don Strock said. "We were shorthanded, but that is not an excuse. You line up with what you have.

"There were holes; but we were also playing with a tight end [Joseph Struyf] and a fullback [Adam Gorman] in the backfield. These were the cards we were dealt."

Struyf played fullback because of the depletion of the backs caused by suspension and injuries. Gorman, in turn, moved over to running back and gained 67 yards on 16 carries. Gorman proved to be more valuable catching passes out of the backfield on Thursday night - snaring 4 passes for 42 yards.

In addition to their inability to stop the run, FIU was hampered by penalties that seemed to come at the most inopportune times. 

With the defense on the field and SFA (3-3) facing a third-and-eight, the Golden Panthers were able to force Williams, a lefty, to the right sideline and eventually throw the ball away. But linebacker Lance Preston lodged himself at Williams and committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that gave the Lumberjacks a first down. Preston's miscue was followed by another personal foul penalty and SFA ended up amassing 30 yards on successive penalties - reaching the FIU 15 without even running a play.

SFA eventually scored on a one-yard run by running back Cliff Edwards, giving the Lumberjacks a 14-0 lead.The Lumberjacks led FIU 14-0 until Adam Moss' 35-yard field goal sailed through the west-end zone uprights with 9:26 to play in the first half.

Josh Padrick followed Moss' field goal with a touchdown drive of his own. The redshirt freshman quarterback hit receiver Chandler Williams on a 30-yard fade route into the back of the end zone to close SFA's lead to four at 14-10.

Williams, a Miami native, had seven receptions for 101 yards. The 6-0, 157 pound receiver has emerged the past two weeks as one of Padrick's favorite targets. Against Georgia Southern a week ago, Williams caught seven balls for 108 yards.

"On the touchdown I was looking at the safety and Chandler released outside and waved his hand because he saw the safety cheating to cover Harold [Leath]," Padrick said afterwards. "We have to work on little, mental things. Stuff happens and they have a real good offense.

"Coach told us what we had to do to keep our defense off the field. But its little things, we keep stressing it, but we are not doing it so well."

Other instances in which the Panthers were close to scoring were halted by crucial penalties. Moss's first of two field goals was a result of FIU's undisciplined nature that has haunted them all year long. After Padrick scrambled to the four-yard line on a draw play, FIU's offensive line committed a false start penalty that pushed the Golden Panthers back five yards after a first-down toss sweep by Gorman went nowhere.

An incompletion to receiver Cory McKinney brought up third-and-goal from the nine when an eight-yard reception by Leath was nullified by a holding penalty. Padrick threw an incompletion on third-and-goal from the 19 before Moss came in to attempt the field goal.

Cornerback Greg Moss had set up FIU after his 28-yard interception return.

"Offensively we had the ball for 72 plays, we go to the three and the five and don't get in [the end zone]," Strock said. "We have to be smart. I say this every week; we have to show more discipline.

"I know we are a young team, but we have to step up and make a play."

Despite closing SFA's lead to just four points, FIU allowed two quick scores to the Lumberjacks that put the game out reach by intermission. SFA led 28-10 with 0:42 left in the second half.

FIU was able to muster a quick four-play drive in order to set up Moss to attempt a 47-yard field goal. 

The sophomore kicker nailed the 47-yarder as time expired and set a new school record in the process. He eclipsed his previous high of 43 yards. FIU trailed 28-13 at the half.

The Lumberjacks scored once more in the third quarter to expand their lead to 35-13. "If anything could have gone wrong...it did," Strock added. "That's what happens when things are going bad."

Headline: Editorial: UP, BBC councils must cooperate on representation
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The University Park and Biscayne Bay student government councils find themselves in the midst of an imbroglio, thanks to a bill proposed by Clayton Solomon, UP-SGC president.

The bill would give UP an additional representative on the University Wide Council, giving them five against BBC's four.

The bill cited the inequity of representation in the current arrangement. Currently, each campus has four representatives on the council, though UP hosts nearly 20,000 more students.

But representation isn't really the core issue. The larger issue is funding. Presently BBC generates roughly 11 percent of SGA's $7 million budget, but receives some 29 percent of the funding, almost three times what they contribute. Solomon doesn't think that's fair, and wants to find another solution. Adding another UP representative to the University Wide Council, Solomon figured, would give UP the voting power to even up the funding.

But BBC believes such a bill would give UP "dictatorial" power over the council, and rightly so. With five representatives, UP would be guaranteed a majority vote, and BBC would be offered no protection from the will of UP, and though Solomon has insisted that it is not his intent to abuse on BBC, he cannot speak for future presidents.

Since then, various compromises have been made and rejected. As the process of compromise continues, the two sides have obtained petition signatures that would allow them to place their bills directly on the ballot for students to vote on, bypassing the council altogether. 

UP would seek to place their five to four council bill on the ballot, while BBC, seeking to maintain status quo, will place a five to five bill on the ballot. If historical precedent holds true, UP students should out-vote BBC students, ensuring that Solomon will get his way, right or wrong, and though BBC seeks to keep equal representation on the council, it is their unequal representation at the polls that may prove to be the undoing of BBC-SGC's efforts, further evidence of why it is so crucial that students vote.

But those bills and petitions, by all accounts, are last-ditch recourse. The sides continue to search for compromises, and this is fortunate. 

The two sides must succeed where previous SGA administrators have failed; they must communicate, all the time remembering that it is their duty to represent the best interest of all students at this university, and not just their respective campus.

Headline: SGA debates over representation, budget
Author: Lisbertha Eustache/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The student government councils of the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses were at odds recently regarding budget and representation issues.

In an Oct.10 meeting, both SGCs debated over a compromise to the bill proposed by UP-SGC president Clayton Solomon that would increase the number of UP representatives that reside on the University Wide Council and attend university-wide meetings to five. Currently, four students from each campus reside on the University Wide Council. 

In addition to difference in numbers of representatives, this proposal calls for a "simple majority" of individuals present to vote on an issue. 

Nicaise Parillon, BBC-SGC president, and Ruth-Allyson Webster, BBC-SGC vice president, did not agree to this proposal because they believe it would cause unequal representation of both campuses.

A total of four bills were drafted by both SGCs, each offering a different solution to the issue. All four bills were rejected and a fifth bill is set to be drafted by both councils together as a compromise on Oct.15.

In their response to UP's first proposal, BBC representatives wrote that "an uneven representation in favor of any particular campus, which would allow quorum and standing decisions without the consultation and compromise of both campuses, is unfair and unjust to the underrepresented."

Aside from the issue of unequal representation in meetings, both SGCs had a problem when it came to the amount of funding each would receive. According to Solomon, based on last year's figures, this year Biscayne Bay is projected to generate 11.36 percent of Activity and Service fees, which are charged to all students along with tuition. Yet recently, they were getting 29 percent from the university to fund programs and organizations in their campus.

"I don't know if that is fair [to University Park students] that so much of our money is going to activities and programs in the other campus," Solomon said.

Solomon insisted that the distribution of funds is the main issue, but BBC representatives say that their concern lies in misrepresentation.

Parillon stated at the meeting that she and the other BBC representatives "do not believe that 5/4 could be dictatorial...but 5/4 with simple majority would be."

Yet, Solomon says that he and the other representatives from the UP campus are not seeking unequal representation, much less dictatorship. A main reason behind their proposal is the number of students enrolled in both campuses. 

As of September of 2003, UP has 27,625 students whereas BBC has 7,879. To UP-SGC representatives, having 5 students from their campus and 4 from BBC is, per their proposal, an "...effective representation...at a ratio of 1:6,906 [UP]...and 1:1,969 [BBC]." 

Parillon stated that although BBC gets money, it is not directly from University Park. The money that her campus receives is from FIU as a whole, after organizations such as Graham Center, Wolfe University Center, and the Recreation Department are funded. The money that is left over is split between both campuses. 

Moreover, in the bills she sponsored, she said that while BBC recognizes that UP generates more funds and has more students, she wants to preserve the balanced composition of the council "to avoid any concentration of power and possible misrepresentation to any particular campus" and to allow BBC students "to have a voice in determining issues that affect the university."

In the four bills that were drafted by both SGCs, a variety of solutions were proposed. 

The first bill, aforementioned above, calls for a fifth UP representative and a majority vote and was sponsored by Solomon and Collette Papa, SGC-UP Speaker of the House. 

A second, drafted by Parillon and Webster, called for a separate committee to decide on budget issues, a 2/3 vote of total members present rather than a simple majority - meaning six people would be needed to agree on an issue - and would agree with UP adding a fifth person to represent them in meetings. 

A third bill was drafted by Papa that asked for the 5/4 representation, to hold on to the simple majority needed for voting instead of the 2/3, and for Biscayne Bay to receive at least 25 percent of funds from FIU. 

The University Wide Council, which oversees the activities of the SGCs, includes both campus presidents, vice presidents, Finance Committee chairpersons, the speaker of the house from UP and the Broward/Pines Center representative, under the guidance of BBC.

 In addition to that council, a University Wide Budget committee would be added in this third bill. This committee would meet once a year in April to handle budget issues. It would consist of the same members of the council along with the Speaker Pro-Tempore (vice chair of the Speaker of the House) from SGC-UP. BBC, on the other hand, would only have one, the representative from Broward that would be appointed by Parillon.  

BBC-SGC composed a fourth bill that asked for 5/5 representation, that is for UP and BBC to each have five individuals present at meetings. Instead of having one individual from BBC in the budget committee, as the third bill indicates, this proposal requested two. 

The University Park council did not agree to this fourth bill due to the fact that it would be very similar to the current situation, and in turn bring up the problem of inadequate representation.

With the many bills that were drafted, SGC representatives from both campuses had students from their respective campus sign petitions for their bills to go through. If 5 percent of the total student population signs a petitition, the amendment can be placed on a ballot for students to vote on in a special election, even if the University Wide Council does not agree on the bill.

Webster is worried about the voting situation on the University Wide Council that could result from the proposed bills.

"If UP gets one more representative, the problem is not us losing money. It is just that they may decide on things [that pertain to our campus] without [all of] us being present," Webster said.  

The fifth proposal combines ideas from the previous bills. For funding, Biscayne Bay would receive 2.25 multiplied by the percentage that they would generate from Activity and Service fees. UP would get the fifth representative. Both campuses will meet on Oct. 15 to draft this proposal together. Only then will it finally be known what both campuses agree on.

Jacqui Sosa, Cabinet Communications Relations/PR representative for UP, was one of the individuals who passed around the petitions. 

"I feel that what the new bill is going to be is exactly what we [FIU] needed," Sosa said.

Headline: Suspected dorm thief caught with incriminating evidence
Author: Ronald Licona/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The person responsible for recent thefts in the dorms has finally been apprehended, FIU Public Safety officers said. 

On Sept. 24 Sgt. Rick Torres arrested Marvin Hendricks on charges of loitering and prowling. 

Some suspicious behavior led to a brief chase when Hendricks (a former FIU student) tried to flee when he was confronted by the FIU PD. 

A search of his possessions at the time of his arrest yielded evidence that tied him to one of the many recent thefts that occurred in the FIU dorms.

Around July 30, a string of thefts began to occur in the University Park Apartments where people claim to have left their rooms for only a couple of minutes only to find some of their possessions missing upon their return. The stolen items included laptops, jewelry boxes, and an X-box. 

What was suspicious about these thefts was that there was never any sign of forced entry (breaking in), said Sgt. Shona McNeil of FIU Crime prevention says that the thefts usually occurred between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. Hendricks was followed by the FIU Police while he suspiciously wandered around apartments A-L around this time. 

Hendricks did have a previous criminal record (for burglary in 1999) and there was in fact a warrant out for his arrest.

Hendricks refuses to cooperate with the police and awaits his court date on Oct. 21st. 

He remains under police custody until then. 

Hendricks is suspected in nine cases of burglary from the FIU dorms.   

McNeil said that students have to be more careful about precautions and make a conscious effort to secure their belongings.

"People need to learn to lock their doors when they go out," McNeil said.

Princeton student hacks copyright protection program

A Princeton University student has found he can defeat a highly touted computer program to prevent music piracy with the stroke of a single key: "Shift."

In a paper posted on his web site on Oct.6, graduate student John Halderman, 22, said he got around restrictions built into the CD "Comin' From Where I'm From," by Anthony Hamilton, a soulful R&B artist. The CD, released by BMG's Arista Records last month, was heavily promoted as the first to use copy management technology.

Nathaniel Brown, a BMG spokesman, admitted the restrictions could be bypassed by a determined consumer. But he likened the software, made by SunnComm Technologies, to a "speed bump" that would deter ordinary consumers from casually making multiple illegal copies.

"It's not going to stop a hacker or someone who wants to mass copy," he said.

BMG, a Bertelsmann subsidiary, and other music companies have sought to discourage mass copying by taking 261 people to court last month for sharing songs without permission and have threatened other lawsuits.

Headline: Interpol lights up Miami with stellar show
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
The speed that New York City indie post-punkers, Interpol gained their fame with is down right frightening. While sifting through the sardine-packed Ice Palace Film Studios last Saturday, Oct. 11, I thought to myself: wasn't it only yesterday when these guys signed to indie heralds, Matador Records and rose to the top of college radio charts? I remember seeing the black-tie clad foursome on MTV a coupe months ago and wondering what the heck was going on. 

Some may call Interpol's success a fluke and the result of a throw back to Joy Division's '80s. The decade has made quite a comeback lately, most notably with clubs like Revolver and Pop-Life where hipsters gather to show off their coolest polka-dot skirts and other apparel resurrected straight from 1983.  

Bands like Interpol are also a good example of '80s revival, especially with singer, Paul Banks, who's low voice bellows memories of Ian Curtis. However, one can only make so many references to bands such as Joy Division, Interpol really does have something of their own to offer and this is what I realized fully at the concert.

After a warm welcome, and not to mention an excellent performance, by fellow New Yorkers, Elefant, the house lights flipped off and slowly re-dimmed to reveal an elegantly dressed Interpol. Opening softly with "Untitled," the mixture of pleasant music with beautifully bright back-lighting made for a gorgeous setting. 

Image was everything, as the light show was definitely one of my favorite aspects of Interpol's performance, acting to compliment the following songs with soft or flat oranges and reds. 

Musically speaking, the group was played a nicely orchestrated set of music. Throwing the crowd into dancing frenzies on songs such as "PDA,"  "Roland" and "Say Hello to the Angels,"(with guitar strumming that reminds me so much of The Smiths' "This Charming Man") the band easily turned the pace around with slower ballads such the "NYC" and "Stella was a diver and she was always down."

No matter the pace, the entire show was nothing less than a good time. Even if you don't happen to like or listen to Interpol all that much, you can at least appreciate their ability to get a crowd's feet moving. 

For true fans of Interpol the show was honestly an incredibly excellent performance. The only legitimate downside to the show, besides an annoying encounter with drunken crowd-members, was the lack of material they have to play. 

With only one full album and a few other small singles, it's hard to get a diverse set of music-it's basically most of Turn on the Bright Lights. Not that I have anything against this, but it would be nice to hear a mixture with other bodies of work. I can imagine that with such a quick rise to fame, it will take some time before Interpol has time to sit down and record a new album. After all, they've got to enjoy their newfound success.

The set was just lengthy enough, keeping it a little under an hour even with an encore. By the time they had finished I felt satisfied and had my fill of live Interpol for the evening. 

With that in mind, I elected out of the afterparty, going on down the street, and instead headed home with very pleased sensory organs.

My initial fear that perhaps this band would not be able to pull off a live show the way I hoped they would was conquered and proved wrong. 

Interpol is still a young band and has a long way to go before going down in the books like their inspirational icons, but they have opened up several avenues for future endeavors into true musical brilliance. I'm happy to say that for now, they're doing a fantastic job.

About a year ago, I stumbled on an interesting band with the most peculiar name. The enigmatic Q And Not U and their addicting music has since dominated my CD players and inspired me to branch out with my musical taste; I've been dying to write a story on these guys for a while.

The D.C. trio totes a unique sound and it's not easy trying to find a comparison.

Perhaps the best words would be from the band themselves. I recently spoke with Q And Not U drummer, John Davis. He shed some light on the mystery of the band and revealed to me that there really is no mystery at all. They're just three normal guys in a band, doing what they do best and enjoying every minute of it.

The band has been on tour, playing shows almost every night since mid September and will make their way to Miami at the I/O, on Oct. 14. 

Q And Not U also recently released two new singles as one short EP, their first recorded release since 2002's Different Damage.

Q: What's it like doing a tour where you play almost every night?

A: It can be very tiring, definitely. After a while you get into it, you sort of just keep going. Each tour has its phases. The first phase is acclimating to the road and getting used to playing every night. By the second or third week you zone out a bit and just get into it.

Q: Do you feel that so much playing and traveling affects your performance?

A: I don't think so, but I wouldn't be surprised. Some nights we're burned out. You get used to playing every night. Generally, it's not too much of a problem.

Q: What is it you love the most about touring?

A: Seeing the country and having that experience of seeing all parts [of the U.S.]. We make hundreds of friends; that's pretty cool. Everyone wants to travel and it's what we do all the time, pretty much for free.

Q: What's your least favorite aspect about touring? 

A; Kind of the obvious, you just miss being away from home or a girlfriend or stuff like that. Not too shocking. 

Q: Is there anything in particular that fans or show-goers do that make you angry?

A: No, nothing really that would incite anger. Really, any attention is appreciated.  Its weird sometimes, having people photograph you setting up but you get used to, it's not a bad thing. Sometimes the crowd can get rowdy, it doesn't happen that often but it's been happening more than usual.

Q: When can we expect the new record?

A: Next year, hopefully sometime late summer or early fall. Right now we have a lot of fragments. The last single we released should be an indicator of where we'll be.

Q: When making a new album, do you feel pressure to live up to the previous release?

A: No, definitely not. That's not even an issue. Anything we release, we'll feel is the best thing we've done yet. If it weren't, we wouldn't want to put it out. When you feel like that, then there is no pressure.

Q:What do you guys do when you're not touring or recording?

A: Not a ton, I do a lot of website designing and publicity for the band. That's like a job in itself. I also design websites for University of Maryland. I like to watch movies, read, buy and listen to records, hang out with my friends, play sports, basic stuff. I appreciate my time off.

Q: What are you guys listening to recently?

A: I brought the Simon and Garfunkle boxset with me on the road. Lately a lot of funk and R&B, African music, Jamaican music, calypso.  As far as new stuff, I love the bands we tour with, El Guapo, Black Eyes, Ted Leo, The French Kicks. Rufus Wainwright, The Walkmen. I listen mainly to older stuff, though.

Q: Where and how did you guys come up with the "Q And Not U sound?"

A: It was totally natural. Nothing to it, it's just kinda what happens when we make music. It's hard for people who make music to describe that process. You can't really remove yourself from it enough to say this is "how " or "why." 

Q: How does being in Q And Not U make you feel? Is it something you see yourself doing for a while? 

A: Yeah, I think so. We're doing the right thing, so yeah, we do love what we do. I'm sure we'll keep going.

Headline: Audio / Visual: David Bowie
Subheadline: Reality: Bowie breathes new life into Heathen personas
Author: Alfred Soto / Editorial Advisor
&nbsp;
Twenty-three years since his last acknowledged classic Scary Monsters, David Bowie has realized that, with his golden years of pilfering underground trends like a model shopping for shoes behind him, the surest means of releasing listenable albums is to plagiarize himself. And why not? The man has great taste.

Bowie has talked up Reality as "just" a collection of tunes - this is a guy, after all, who digs concept albums. But the Thin White Duke's been wrong before (listened to any Tin Machine albums lately?), and the last time he assembled a miscellany this consistent was 1979's Lodger, on which songs bursting with the backward guitars, cricket noises and violin solos inspired by the oblique strategies of collaborator Brian Eno adduced the fecundity of Bowie's imagination even at his most undisciplined. 

On last year's Heathen, Bowie took his role of Post-Millennial Sage way too seriously, loading the album with too many ballads which purred with a quiet menace but only demonstrated that Bowie's been reading the same Orwell books since the days of Diamond Dogs. There's a satisfying homemade air to Reality which sits well with the persona Bowie perhaps unwittingly constructed on Heathen: the Englishman in New York, quietly observing post-9/11 Manhattan over a caramel machiatto. 

Songs like "Days" and "Never Get Old" sound as if Bowie and producer Tony Visconti played every note themselves, and even if they didn't, Visconti's uncluttered mix belies the care with which synthesizers, rhythm guitars and crisp snares have been layered (Visconti's stellar job helming Reality and Heathen proves that no other producer intuits Bowie's processes with such accuracy). His covers of George Harrison and Jonathan Richman songs are the only duds; Bowie tries too hard to tart them up with ponderous keyboard swells and vocal histrionics. 

"New Killer Star" is a killer first single, chugging along on a crunchy guitar hook and a great "Ready, set, go!" chorus. The humility ("I never said I'm better") never curdles into sanctimony; Bowie sounds as confused as the rest of us at the prospect of being too smart and centered for a world in which these values are besides the point. I emphasize sounds, because with Bowie, the line between simulation and reality is as thin as his waistline. 

Which is why Reality's last song "Bring Back The Disco King" is so affecting: a piano lament that's all melodrama and swishy wrists, in which the old queen looks back at the wild parties of his youth and shudders with embarrassment and regret.

Headline: It's All In Your Head: Eve 6's latest fails to live up to previous releases
Author: Dan Conway, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The new Eve 6 album It's All In Your Head is their first studio effort in over three years. The band's appearance has changed quite a bit since their last album. They're a little shaggier, a little beefier, and they've got more tattoos but other than that they're the same band. 

I wish I could say the same for their music. The band's self-titled debut in 1998 was a phenomenal artistic achievement. This latest work is just not of the same caliber. It seems like the group is trying to find itself, exploring different styles, speeds and topics. 

But what they're searching for seems to be widespread acceptance, not musical credibility. Most of the songs on this album have topics ranging from recreational drug use to losing girlfriends. Some of the songs I found to be the worst, lyrically, were "Think Twice" and "At Least We're Dreaming." Ironically, "Think Twice" is the first single off the album. The song just wasn't fresh; the sound was stale and overdone. 

Not all the songs should   be without merit though. "Bring the Night On" has a hint of the style heard in their first album, principally in its lyric style and general feel. My favorite track is "Hey Montana," which uses a sound much like that of the late great music legend, Johnny Cash. 

But hey, if you're going to choose an inspiration, you can do a lot worse! 

"Friend of Mine" and "Not Gonna Be Alone Tonight" were also well done tracks with original lyrics and style. For the most part, however, the rest of the album was just a pathetic attempt to cash in on pop-rock's teenage audience of today's mainstream scene. 

It's All In Your Head lacks depth, originality, and is just too easily forgettable. Now don't count out the band based on this album's disappointment. 

If you haven't heard of this band or you're interested in a different sound, check out their earlier albums, especially their first. You'll be glad you did.

Headline: Audio / Visual: "Kill Bill, Vol. 1"
Subheadline: "Kill Bill": Tarantino gives cinema-violence impeccable style
Author: Chris Hewitt / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, you will not be surprised to learn that many characters from "Kill Bill: Vol. 1" don't survive for "Vol. 2."

Dozens of people die spurty deaths in "Kill Bill," a movie that breaks a lot of limbs, coffee tables and cinematic rules. 

After the not-bad "Jackie Brown," "Kill Bill" returns the writer-director to the level of playful inventiveness he hit in "Pulp Fiction," confirming that - in terms of screwing with the heads of moviegoers, using music to amp up the thrills and choreographing action so that it is both surprising and inevitably right - no one can touch him.

The movie feels almost like a Tarantino personal ad, written in the hope it will find the person who shares all his interests and can spot all his references. 

Although it's unlikely anyone other than the movie-mad Tarantino can spot everything, it's still fun to try: Uma Thurman (who is sensational) draws the same imaginary square-in-the-air that she drew in "Pulp Fiction." 

There's a giddy little moment in which an aerial shot seems to show us the exact layout of a room that's about to erupt in carnage, but when the camera angle shifts, we realize Tarantino was fooling us. And the name of Thurman's character is bleeped every time it's spoken, as if it's an expletive or a sensitive word in an FBI file.

Certainly, the file on the woman we know only as The Bride would be thick. She's a member of a team of hired killers, all of whom work for Bill, whose voice we hear but whose face is apparently being saved for "Vol. 2." Left for dead as the film opens, The Bride is determined to repair her mangled body. 

She is determined to get revenge. She is determined to kill Bill.

It's a simple story, but Tarantino embroiders by shifting back and forth in time to tell the tales of The Bride's fellow killers, played by Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah and Lucy Liu. 

Liu's story is the best, a powerful Japanese-style animated sequence that gets at the heart of what makes Tarantino so much fun to watch.

 It's as if the traditional forms of filmmaking can't keep up with his restless imagination.

The result is a movie that is a gift for action fans, especially since we know "Vol. 2" is coming in February. 

It's like eating the first peanut butter cup in a two-cup pack: It's satisfying on its own, but you can't wait to get to the second one.

Headline: Audio / Visual: "Intolerable Cruelty"
Subheadline: "Intolerable Cruelty": Actors' brilliant performance, surprising
Author: Michelle Roberts / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a world of liposuction, Botox, pre-nups and weddings that end before the honeymoon begins, love can conquer all ... in an underhanded, devilishly fun kind of way.

The witty masterpiece of acclaimed directing duo Joel and Ethan Coen (known for the film "Fargo"), "Intolerable Cruelty" is in a class all its own.  Words, I'm afraid, simply won't do the movie justice.  It is candy for the mind and eyes.  The film sets high standards right off the bat, with a cast jam-packed with some of Hollywood's most major players and Oscar winners, nonetheless.    

The union of George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones is like the merger of two powerful corporations - together they're on fire!  The chemistry between the two is hot enough to make even the viewers blush during kissing scenes, and is evident as soon as they're seen together.  There's nothing cruel about the combination.

George Clooney emerges very much as a classic leading man in this romantic comedy, playing Miles Massy, a narcissistic divorce attorney who never loses in a challenge. His life is turned upside-down when he meets Marylin (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a woman who always gets her mark. Both decide to take a chance on love, but not before they do unspeakably vicious things to one another.   

The madness of the opening scene sets the stage for the rest of the comedy that ensues throughout the movie.  The fast-paced scenes, intelligent dialogue and phenomenal editing keep the movie's momentum going non-stop.  

Anyone who decides to step out for a bathroom or popcorn break will undoubtedly miss a whole lot in a film where there are surprises around every corner.  Not to sound clich√©, but expect the unexpected.  

All of the actors turned out brilliant performances.  Perhaps George Clooney was the most surprising, as he showed such great depth, delivering all of the many complicated lines with perfection, juggling his character's suave but jittery persona, and staying neck-and-neck with the many accomplished actors on board.  As for Catherine Zeta-Jones, her presence and charisma onscreen command respect.  It's difficult to pinpoint which shines brighter:  her beauty or her talent.

Among the others that had smaller but distinguished roles in the film, Billy Bob Thornton, Geoffrey Rush and Cedric the Entertainer were quintessential in making "Intolerable Cruelty" as innovative and fresh as it is.  All actors were able to hold their own in the film, adding to its absolute quality.  The caliber of acting in the movie is so high, you'll forget you're watching fictional characters. "Intolerable Cruelty" redefines romantic comedies.  Sure it's romantic and funny, but it's also just so darn smart, daring, unique and well presented.  

It seems that everything George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones touch turns to gold.  With "Intolerable Cruelty" under their belts, it's safe to say that Oscar gold is easily within their reach.  It's just that good.

Headline: 'Picasso' questions time with comedy
Author: By Isis Iglesias
&nbsp;
On opening night of the FIU Theatre season, Einstein sits at the stage puffing on a pipe. He is sitting in a bar, the famous Lapin Agile of Montmartre on a night around 100 years ago.  The play is "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" and it features quasi-real characters based on actual people, in an imaginary trip to the moment when two 20th century geniuses meet. Actor, Steve Martin is the playwrite so you can expect everything from corny jokes to time travel. 

FIU Theatre's production of the play is a miracle in casting; each actor is physically suited to his role. It is the kind of chance detail that only adds to the enjoyment of the audience.  

A young bespectacled Einstein portrayed by Emilio Rivas, complete with a funny German accent, sits chatting about his work as a physicist and the release of his new book on the theory of relativity.  The sophisticated bar staff is not impressed. Freddy, the bar owner, quizzes him on mathematics as he does his accounting, and Germaine, the bartender, tells him his book is going to need some clever marketing if he expects it to sell.  

We get to know the other characters before the immense Picasso arrives; overshadowing all with his great talent and ego. Suzanne is smitten with Picasso, she waits at the bar clutching his unsigned drawing of her. Gaston is the consummate barfly, he sits observing it all getting up only to relieve his bladder, offstage.  

Enter the art dealer Sagot, marvelously played by Michael Anthony Nu√±ez, who acts with every muscle in his body. His sexy quips make the audience howl with laughter; with his haughty posture he turns every line into provocative statement. "I got a Matisse today," Sagot exclaims, "small but juicy...stick it up there, Freddy." The joke is in the delivery, which Nu√±ez nails perfectly as he does a full turn on the stage.

The award-winning script is delivered right on target by the talented cast directed by Rafael Oliveira, the actors do not miss any nuance in meaning, or any opportunity for filling the characters with energetic physicality. 

Picasso is himself, robust and cocky. His spirit is channeled well by Ricky Waugh, with a devilish gleam in his eye, his hands roam over the ladies while his mind feverishly explores the mysteries of creativity.  

Germaine played smartly by Minette Perez is the realist, a strong feminine character that is at the center of the Lapin Agile. She gets it all, even Picasso.  

Freddy, the most subdued of the characters is deadpanned accurately by Ramon Vuenes as he dries the bar glasses, strums the guitar and gives Sagot an art identification quiz.  There are also a couple of gender-bending walk-on characters that only add to the absurdity of the work.   

These passionate players muse over everything from the new century, the eternal battle of the sexes, the stars, science, and art to more raucous sex. 

Martin's jokes time travel; plundering the past and present to uncover universal truths. There is even one fabulous time-traveling character, that won't be mentioned here, so as not to ruin the surprise. 

The costumes by Heather Rae Miller are well chosen and add authenticity to the scenes from the paint splattered frock of Picasso to the tweed suited Einstein. The only thing that detracts from the performances is the stage itself, the space is a little too large; the characters at times seem lost in it, they stand a little too far from each other. 

The set of the Paris bar is well created but the style is too generic, like a Pottery Barn rendition of a caf√©. The Lapis Agile itself would have made an interesting character if it wasn't for its stylistic blandness; a few bohemian extras and some dirt would have added much to the ambience. 

Simone de Beauvoir once said "One is not born a genius, one becomes a genius." "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" shows that becoming; this character-driven play transports us to the meeting place of art and science. These characters are filled with an optimistic enthusiasm and want to leave their mark on the world. The energetic FIU theatre group captures this spirit well, with a production that is both professional and artistic.  

The play continues its run next weekend, Oct. 16 - 19th, at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center. Tickets are $6 for FIU Students and can purchased by phone at (305) 348-3789 or at the box office one hour prior to show time.
