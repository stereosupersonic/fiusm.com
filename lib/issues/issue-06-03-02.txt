Headline: FIU teams need alumni, student support
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Part two of a two-part interview

The Beacon sat down with Jerry Del Castillo, Spanish play-by-play voice for FIU sports on "La Cadena Azul," WRHC 1550 AM.

Del Castillo, who used to broadcast University of Miami sports, shares his thoughts on the current state of FIU sports and where they are headed. 

Q: In your opinion, what are the biggest problems facing FIU sports and what do you think are possible solutions?

They shouldn't try and be the University of Miami Jr. That doesn't help them at all and I am not saying that they are trying to do that, it is just something that they have to avoid. They have to be able to sell themselves to these kids in terms of being serious in the athletic department [and show] that they want this program to go. I think it is imperative for the students to support this. 

We are still in the crawling stages of this; we are not there. We need to get students to buy into this. I don't know if we have done a very good job at getting the alumni to come back to school. I think we give them a reason now with the on-campus stadium. I think the on-campus stadium is going to help. 

We need to do a better job as a university of getting the people back once. Once we get them back once, we have to do a better job in having them come back again. Let's just concentrate on football. You have to get the students to buy into it and the alumni. Playing UM is going to help. 

Q: The football program has, since its first year, always had a problem with attendance. What does it, in your opinion, need to do in order get folks excited and put people in the seats?

If I had an answer to that … I think the key to this is the students. In order to do this, you have to get the professors to buy into it. I don't know if they have. 

I don't attend FIU - my children do. It is a commuter school; it always has been, but you have 3,000 kids [who live on campus] there. How many kids live in the area? These are the same kids that are going to UM games. That's fine. It's not like UM is drawing incredible numbers. [UM] played Virginia this year, a top-25 team, and they basically drew 34,000 fans. 

It's not like [Hurricane fans] are knocking down the turnstiles - unless they are playing Florida State. I don't think FIU needs to draw 70,000 people. Once they build the stadium on campus, it will give the alumni a reason to come back. 

[Another reason for poor attendance is] not enough corporate involvement. As the stadium stands now, what corporations are going to get involved? Not just involved with donating money, that is not the answer, it is about getting people to come out. Having employees come out. Having a company day. Having the company bring out 100 people. Out of those 100 people, maybe 20 will continue to come in the future. That is what you need to do, you have to create better habits. 

One thing that FIU has to do, and we play a role in it, is marketing to the Hispanic community. The entertainment dollar is pretty much spent. You have to pick your battles. If you go to a Heat game you know what that will cost. Same with the Dolphins. It is still a bargain to go and see an FIU football game [and] FIU basketball. 

FIU basketball should be better supported by the students. Last time I checked, didn't the students get in for free? I understand that [FIU] plays in the Sun Belt [Conference] and that doesn't tickle any insides to see Arkansas State. These teams don't tickle anybody. 

I think FIU has such an advantage. It is a beautiful campus, people that go there and I have brought people to games. I buy tickets and get tickets and give tickets. 

People say, "I graduated from this place and it has changed." I ask them, "When did you graduate?" and they answer "1981." The next question [I ask] is, "how long has it been since you came back?" and they respond, "Not since 1981." 

That is the kind of thing that needs to change. The easiest way to get the alumni involved is through sports. I envision once they build that stadium, [they will be] selling out every week.

Headline: Men's team stumbles against conference leader
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the season winding down, the men's basketball team seems to have lost its footing. 

Facing the best team in the conference on the road, FIU (8-18, 4-9) dropped another decision away from Pharmed Arena, falling 80-65 at the hands of Western Kentucky (21-6, 12-2) Feb. 25 at E.A. Diddle Arena in Bowling Green, Ky. 

FIU played without senior captain and leading scorer Ivan Almonte, who was suspended following his war of words with head coach Sergio Rouco during the Feb. 21 loss to South Alabama.  

"We cut their lead to six but [WKU] forced a couple of turnovers that led to a couple of easy baskets in the last two minutes [of the first half]. That pretty much was the end of the game," Rouco said.

Johwen Villegas and Ismael N'Diaye tried to pick up the slack left behind by the absence of the No. 5 rebounder in the country, but with all five of the Hilltoppers starters scoring in double figures, FIU struggled. 

Villegas connected on 7-of-16 shots, including six 3-pointers, to lead the visitors with 21 points, 15 of which came in the first half, before the junior from Guaynab, Puerto Rico jammed his left thumb, restricting his second half output.

N'Diaye added nine points and a career-high 14 rebounds, but the Golden Panthers trailed from the start and never found their way to a lead. 

Western Kentucky, the team who coaches voted the best from day one in the Sun Belt East division, has made easy picking of the Sun Belt schedule this year and is a team that may receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament if they fail to win the Championship in Murfreesboro, Tenn. during the first week of March.

The Hilltoppers were led by guard Courtney Lee's 20 points and center Elgrace Wilborn who came just one block short of his first triple-double with 15 points, 15 rebounds and nine blocks. 

"We missed at least four lay-ups in the first half," Rouco said. "[Wilborn] really came to play tonight. He played a whale of a game and he was their enforcer underneath. He smelled blood when he didn't see Ivan on the floor and he said, 'I'm going to take it to these young bucks,' and he did. That's what great players do." 

FIU was able to maintain the pace the WKU set early on and trailed by only six with around two minutes remaining in the first half. The hosts then went on a 9-0 run to head into the locker room with a commanding 51-36 lead. 

The two teams tied the second half, scoring 29 points each, as the halftime difference proved to be the decider.

FIU dropped its regular season finale Feb. 27 to Middle Tennessee, 82-58. Almonte, who returned to the lineup, recorded a game-high 23 points and 13 rebounds. 

Rouco and his team will return to Murfreesboro, Tenn. for the Sun Belt Conference Tournament, where they will face New Orleans in a first round matchup March 3 at 2:30 p.m.

Headline: Senior shines in final home game
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It was a big night for the women's basketball team Feb. 27 at Pharmed Arena, but an even bigger night for senior point guard Faeza Bouderra, who was playing in her final home game. She was greeted before the game with a speech from head coach Cindy Russo and presented with flowers as hundreds of fans waving French flags looked on.  

Bouderra surely didn't disappoint those who honored her as she pulled out a career-high 22 points to go along with seven assists and two steals to help her team cruise past second place Middle Tennessee 73-57.

"I'm still trying to recover from it," Bouderra said. "I don't think I'll ever forget my senior night."

The women's basketball team ended their season against the top two teams in the Sun-Belt Conference and after a tough loss to Western Kentucky, was able to bounce back against the Blue Raiders and dominate them throughout the second half.

Thanks to two 3-pointers from Iva Ciglar, who had a big night off the bench with 10 points and five assists, the Golden Panthers went on a 10-2 run to take a commanding 53-36 lead.  

It was smooth sailing from then on and it opened the door for history to be made. With two minutes remaining and the shot clock winding down, Bouderra received a pass from Liene Bernsone as she pulled up from the free-throw line to give her a career high.  

Then, in her last play before being taken out to a standing ovation, Bouderra stole the ball and made a brilliant behind the back pass to Iva Ciglar for an easy lay-up. It was symbolic of the passing of the torch from one great point guard to another. Bouderra will leave after this season, but her spot will be in good hands as Ciglar has shown promise at the position this season.

Bouderra's eyes lit up after the back-to-back plays and the fans were as electric as the smile on her face.

"I was so excited," Bouderra said. "Everyone kept telling me to shoot and I didn't know why. Then, after I made that shot, I realized I had passed my career-high and I was really happy."

The Golden Panthers had to deal with a furious full-court press throughout the entire game, which caused 25 turnovers in their previous game against Western Kentucky, but this time they were not fazed.

They moved the ball efficiently and got out in transition where they outscored Middle Tennessee 13-0. But that was not as impressive as the defense they played, which held MTSU guard Chrissy Givens - a player that averages 22 points per game - to six points on 1-of-10 shooting.

"Defense was definitely the key to this game," Russo said. "When you hold a player the caliber of [Givens] to only six points, you've done a good job."

The Golden Panthers also shot the ball well, as they ended the night shooting 53 percent from the field - while holding the Raiders to just 33 percent shooting. 

Lasma Jekabsone contributed 20 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks for her 14th double-double of the year.

The win puts FIU at 16-11 and 9-5 versus Sun Belt Conference foes. After the conclusion of the regular season, Middle Tennessee and FIU finished second and third, respectively, in the conference as they get set for the conference tournament.

"From now on, no stats matter," Bouderra said. "At any given time any team can beat [you]. It takes a lot of heart and intelligence on the court to win [a Sun Belt Conference championship]."

The conference tournament will be held in Murfreesboro, Tenn., the home site of Middle Tennessee. The Golden Panthers will open up the tournament against New Orleans March 2 at 8:30 p.m. FIU beat New Orleans 87-51 in their first meeting this season.

Headline: Foreign companies running ports not an intelligent move
Author: Christopher Necuze / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
To some, this may come as a shock, to others this may be seen as treason. For a person who, most of the time, finds himself alone in supporting President George Bush and conservative ideals, it may seem odd that I am writing against him. 

Earlier this month, a plan was introduced to sell Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P & O), a company based in Britain which manages operations in 22 U.S. ports, to Dubai Ports World; DP World, for short - a company owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates.

The very idea of a foreign power in charge of operations to some of the largest ports in the country was, admittedly, foreign to me. For some reason, I was under the impression that the United States ran its own ports or the ports were in the control of the local government of their respective cities. 

Even so, upon learning that the foreign power in charge of our ports was our old pal Great Britain, I didn't give it a second thought. When the news broke that P & O was to be sold to DP World, the usual bickering by Democrats ensued. 

That said, I had a problem with this deal. Even though the UAE has been a valuable ally over the past few years, I was still not comfortable with the idea of a government which might still have ties to Islamic fascism taking over U.S. port operations. Trusting that the UAE will remain on our side in the War on Terror is not a chance I want to take.

Some of those who are regular supporters of the Bush administration and its policies, like Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and pundit Sean Hannity, have also found the news hard to swallow. This controversy has Republicans all over split. 

The president argues that to not allow this deal to go through would be undermining an essential ally, saying "What kind of signal does it send throughout the world if it's OK for a British company to manage the ports but not a company that has been secured - that has been cleared for security purposes from the Arab world?"

The worst part about this whole situation is that he is right; it sends a horrible message to our allies in the Middle East. I understand that my position may reek of mistrust for Middle Eastern government, but at this point in time I honestly could not trust any government with even the slightest ties to Islamic radicalism with the lives of its own citizens, let alone my life or the lives of my fellow Americans.

In its defense, DP World is allowing a more thorough review of the takeover deal by U.S. lawmakers in hopes to quell any opposition. Though I applaud the efforts of the top brass of DP World for trying to make peace with its harshest critics, this seems to be only a short-term solution to a problem that could have resounding consequences in the future.     

President Bush needs to take a step back and make sure he knows what he's doing. As much as I want to support the president, be it Bush or otherwise, this deal seems premature at best. Bush has opened himself up to criticisms in the only area where he has had a regular base of support: security. I agree with you most of the time, President Bush, but on this one, I whole-heartedly disagree.

Headline: Racism present in Olympic speedskating
Author: Julie Costa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Just in case you missed them, the 2006 Winter Olympic Games, held in Turin, Italy, rocked! I'm not usually a big sports fan but I really got into the spirit of competition this year, watching everything from figure skating, skiing, hockey and even curling. Yes, even curling.

It really doesn't bother me  that the Americans didn't win gold (or silver or bronze) in most of the events where they were held to be the favorites or that they didn't live up to the media hype about how good they were. I figure American athletes, and Americans in general, are too cocky for their own good, anyway.

The unfolding drama between speedskaters Chad Hedrick and Shani Davis was the one thing that kept me plastered to my television every night, checking out all the latest turn of events. I didn't really think very much about Hedrick and Davis' tense relationship until I watched for myself, the night when Davis won the gold medal in the men's 1000 meter.

Davis' teammate Joey Cheek- who won silver in the men's 1000 meter made sure to hug and congratulate him on his history-making gold medal. Hedrick, on the other hand, only made sure to congratulate Cheek. 

This reaction certainly didn't look to me like the actions of a gracious Olympic competitor. In fact, it made the rivalry between Davis and Hedrick, whether or not it was ever really there appear more serious.

Before all this I wasn't even aware that speedskating existed, and would have remained that way, had it not been for the young and absolutely gorgeous Apollo Anton Ohno. Thank you Olympic Committee in charge of those skin-tight body suits! However, it was not Ohno's heavenly physique that kept up my interest in the sport.

I was upset the night that Hedrick was obviously still bitter toward Davis for his decision not to race in the team pursuit earlier that week. Hedrick came across as very selfish. Who does he think he is that he doesn't have the decency to give Davis, his teammate, an obligatory smile and handshake for winning his best race? 

As I vented over Hedrick's poor attitude to my family, my mother brought up a very interesting point. 

"You shouldn't be too surprised, after all, he's probably the only black man in that entire sport," she said. 

I was genuinely flabbergasted by her response. Was she insinuating that the animosity between the two skaters was because of racism? No way! Right?

For the remainder of the week, I thought about my mother's comment and, after listening to interviews and reading articles about Davis' experience in the sport, began to realize that racism was definitely a key player in the situation. 

From my experiences with previous games, most Olympic athletes make gracious winners, but understand that losing is a part of competition and that the best athlete wins. It seems only fitting that an American competitor could be the only athlete who can't seem to come to terms with that concept. 

I'm not naive. I'm very much aware that racism still exists today in the United States. 

But, why didn't I identify that as discrimination when I witnessed it? Why did I insist that it was all a personal conflict and not a racist tendency in Hedrick's background; or even a racist tendency in the history of speedskating? Maybe it was because I wanted to think of the Olympics as an equal playing field - the one place where the goal is to treat all competitors as if anyone of them, at any time, could win the gold. And, maybe, there's nothing wrong with that picture.

After pondering the question a while and watching the rest of the speedskating soap opera unfold, I realized that Davis being only the second African American competitor in the history of the Winter Olympic Games has very little to do with potentially prejudiced teammates, but rather with what my Race Relations professor would call "secondary structural assimilation." In this particular case, that means how African Americans are represented in areas like jobs, education, politics and, as in this case, sports.

As I've learned in my Race Relations class, African Americans are not well represented in the job market because, if they were, the idea of a black CEO would not be surprising. If they were well represented in education, then the idea of a black person dropping out or quitting wouldn't be a stereotype - just something we shrug off as normal.

Davis is a perfect example of how blacks are poorly represented in sports. Sure, everyone is used to black football or basketball players but you rarely find them outside of certain sports. For example, ever heard of a black water polo star? Would you find a black figure skater unique due to their skin color? How about a black gymnast or ski jumper? 

The reason why you would find them unique is because many African Americans are not given the financial resources and social support systems they need to compete in sports dominated by whites in this country.

Reading the articles about Shani Davis' history, everything from his lack of support from friends in his neighborhood to his battles with other skaters wishing he would break his leg during competition, sadly reinforces that racism still exists and why we need to take a class that teaches us to be aware of discrimination in the United States of America - the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Subheadline: Students take part in festival, work with celebrity chefs
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Over 300 hospitality management students helped cap off the 30 events of the 2006 South Beach Wine and Food Festival this past weekend.

Held Feb. 23 - 26 and hosted by the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management and presented by Food and Wine magazine, the charity event hosted some of the world's greatest chefs and gave HTM students first hand experience in the culinary field.

"It's a great event for students [to] meet people and network," said David McCelvey, culinary director of Emeril Lagasee's restaurants.

The festival hosted 100 restaurants and 400 chefs including Food Network stars Bobby Flay, Rachael Ray, Paula Deen, Tyler Florence and Lagasee in the four-day event. 

A large percentage of the profits of the event go towards support for the educational programs and facilities at the HTM School.

According to HTM Dean Lee Dickson, the total amount of money collected this year is yet to be determined.

Dickson was glad that the festival brought tourism to the city and that HTM students were part of it.

"It is a world-class event that brings people to Miami," Dickson said. "Students interested get ample opportunities to work with professionals in the business."

Two years ago, the school earned $100,000 and made $50,000 last year. This year's financial report will be released later this month.

FIU students enjoyed taking part in the fifth annual festival in which they aided with food preparation and the marketing and management of participating restaurants.

"It's an organized chaos but a lot of fun for us," said graduate student Aaron Abramoff, a cooking assistant on the main stage to celebrity chefs. "Seeing students work with organizers and everything running smoothly is excellent."

The toughest task for students included the Grand Tasting Village, which hosted 200-booths and over 7,000 visitors on Feb. 25-26.

"I have blisters on my feet, I'm super tired and it's a lot of work but I'm happy to be part of it," said senior Maren Koncet, who was in charge of making sure there was Evian water in every tent.

The Grand Tasting tents offered visitors a chance to watch celebrity chefs cook up delicious foods on three stages as HTM students assisted.

Ted Allen, chef and part of the five some from Bravo's "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," enjoyed working with student Luis Menndizabal on stage.

"I've done 50 to 60 of these cooking demonstrations and [Menndizabal] has been the best by far," Allen, who is also a judge on Food Network show "Iron Chef," said. "I love that students get the experience here and show their passion for becoming chefs."

This was the third year senior Menndizabal took part in the festival. Last year, he was named The Miami Herald's Best Young Chef in a competition that included 12 students from different culinary schools in Florida.

"The experience you get is really priceless," Menndizabal said. "You can't value enough the people you meet and contacts you make."

Anyone interested in attending next year's festival must buy tickets early - the event sells out months in advance.

FIU:
Research Institute on Social and Economic Policy report on Miami-Dade County's housing proposal

The University's Research Institute on Social and Economic Policy issued a report Feb. 28 that said Miami-Dade County's housing proposal for middle-income families will not be efficient. 

According to the report, it will benefit upper-income households that do not need affordable housing. 

However, Barbara J. Jordan, Miami-Dade Commissioner said that FIU is basing their report on a version of the proposal which came out in November 2005 and that there is a final proposal on its way. 

Part of the proposal includes 20 percent of homes in an unincorporated area of Miami to be set-aside for families earning 65 percent to 140 percent. 

The problems that the report addressed is that developers shall build homes for those at the high end of the scale and the majority of people targeted will be left out because the median income in Miami-Dade county is varies widely.

College of Business Administration receives Grant

A $286,209 grant was awarded to the College of Business Administration from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). 

The award is intended to train Central American and Dominican business executives. 

It is also intended to develop the Small and Medium Enterprises Center of Excellence (SMECE) in the University. 

The center will have four weeks of web-based instruction and a three-day intensive workshop which will consist of classroom instruction by professors and site visits to Miami export and import companies. 

The University is expected to train 40 entrepreneurs who will learn strategies for accessing American markets as well as procedures for dealing with customs brokerages, port authorities and outlets.

Headline: Visas denied for political views, academic groups sue
Author:  Warren P. Strobel / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Three academic groups, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the Bush administration Jan. 25 to stop it from barring foreign scholars from the United States based on their political views.

The lawsuit seeks to overturn the government's use of the so-called "ideological exclusion" provision of the USA Patriot Act, which the Bush administration cited in revoking a visa for Tariq Ramadan, a prominent Islamic scholar, in August 2004. Ramadan has sought to reconcile the Islamic and Western worlds and was offered a teaching position at the University of Notre Dame. His case has become a symbol for concerns over restrictions on academic freedom.

"If the instance of Ramadan is any indication, we are concerned about scholars ... who may be prevented from coming to speak with us, to meet with us," said Barbara DeConcini, executive director of the Georgia-based American Academy of Religion, which invited him to speak at its annual conference in 2004.

The group, which calls itself the world's largest association of scholars of religion, rarely takes stands on public policy issues. "It was important for us to step up to the plate," DeConcini said.

Megan Gaffney, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, said she had no comment on the lawsuit.

It was filed by the ACLU on behalf of the religion group, the American Association of University Professors and the literary group PEN American Center. Many scholars are expressing concern that security restrictions invoked in the name of fighting terrorism have constricted academic debate on controversial issues.

Knight Ridder reported last month that the State Department has been using ideological litmus tests in a program that sends American experts overseas to represent the United States, weeding out critics of the Iraq war. The department denied it was doing so. In the last two years, the government also has barred 61 Cuban scholars who were to have attended a 2004 conference, and Dora Maria Tellez, a Nicaraguan scholar and former minister of health.

"The government has resurrected a practice that existed during the Cold War of excluding people because of their views and is manipulating immigration laws to do so," said Jameel Jaffer, an ACLU staff attorney.

The Bush administration has never fully explained its decision to revoke Ramadan's visa days before he was to come to the United States. Russ Knocke, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, said at the time that the decision was based on "public safety or national security interests."

A provision of the Patriot Act, amended last May, allows the government to exclude a foreigner who's found to "endorse or espouse terrorist activity or persuade others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization," according to the lawsuit. The suit seeks to invalidate that provision.

Ramadan's many defenders say that, although he's been highly critical of the Bush administration's foreign policy, he has condemned terrorism. Ramadan, a Swiss citizen, was invited by British Prime Minister Tony Blair last year to join a government task force on the sources of extremism in Britain.

Critics, including analyst Daniel Pipes, say Ramadan's been much more equivocal on the issue of terrorism. Pipes called Ramadan "Islamist royalty" in an article because his grandfather, Hassan Banna, founded the Muslim Brotherhood, the Middle East's oldest Islamist group. Ramadan reapplied for a U.S. visa but was told last month that it could take almost two years to get an answer, the suit says.

Headline: Readership program re-initiated
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This semester, the Student Government Association  decided to bring back the Collegiate Readership Program, a program designated to promote literacy and global awareness on campus through students' daily exposure to the news via publications like USA Today and The Miami Herald.

The Leadership Program was initiated two years ago during the 2003-2004 academic year when Clayton Solomon was SGA president.  It was a pilot program (an experimental program) that the student government was trying out on campus to see if students would make use of. However, after the year was over, the program wasn't renewed until this semester when current SGA President Alex Prado and other members of the SGA Board jointly agreed on bringing back the program for another semester, again as a pilot program. 

"The Readership Program was something that was only temporary," Prado said. "It's like a test. It was something Clayton did during his tenure as president and it's something I decided to bring back this semester."

SGA decided to start the program again in the Spring rather than the Fall because they didn't want to start the program in the middle of a semester.

"I started it at the beginning of the Spring 2006 semester because it was hard to get in contact with the companies and bargain a good deal," Prado said. "I wanted to start it at the beginning of a new term because I believe it is something students can go and pick up from the beginning of a semester rather than the middle of one," Prado said.

"The goal of The Collegiate Readership Program is to enhance the learning environment on campus, by exposing students to the news outside the campus, be it local news or national news," said Prado.

The Collegiate Readership Program was developed at Penn State University in 1997 under the leadership of Penn State President Graham Spanier. Spanier created the program as a way to make sure that his students were exposed to the world beyond the boundaries of the campus. The success of the program was very evident and it has now spread to nearly 400 campuses across the United States.

Currently, the program at FIU offers a combination of two newspapers: a national newspaper, USA Today, and a local newspaper, The Miami Herald. Papers are distributed on a daily basis and are delivered across various locations on campus including resident halls each weekday morning. Readership levels are tallied by picking up the leftover papers and seeing how many have been taken.

"It is something very collegiate," Prado said. "Most major universities have it and it's just good to have something like this so that students can get news of things that are happening outside the school or outside Miami."

Prado hopes that the new program will be successful this semester. He also hopes that the faculty will start incorporating it into their classes so that the program will be continued into the next academic year under the new administration.

At the Biscayne Bay Campus, SGA President Lemar Linton has a separate program in which they distribute The New York Times.

"We started the program on campus because a lot of professors are requiring newspapers for their courses," Linton said.

Headline: 2006 Food & Wine Festival
Subheadline: South Beach tasting experience proves valuable, delicious
Author: Michelle Santisteban
&nbsp;
There are many different forms of art in this world: painting, sculpting, even landscaping. However, there are many who tend to forget that cooking is an art form as well. It involves just as much technique, skill and ability. The 2006 Wine and Food Festival showed me that cooking is not to be taken lightly. 

With sand in between your toes and the sound of waves splashing in the background, where else can a person enjoy such a festival anywhere else other than South Beach? 

The beginning of the Grand Tasting Village on Feb. 25 introduced Food Network's Bobby Flay. The "Iron Chef" put on quite a show while explaining how to make a salad the way an art teacher explains how to paint - to focus on texture, avoid being one-dimensional and to use negative space wisely when serving the food on a plate.

Flay's humor was a nice surprise as well. With interaction with audience members and a surprise visit from corky chef Paula Deen, I almost forgot the serious and intense persona of Flay when starring on "Iron Chef America." 

When Flay wrapped up his show, guests began rushing to the tents where the food and drink were to be served. Finally, the gates opened and my taste buds began to get spoiled

From deliciously marinated fresh tuna to a chocolate cake that melted in my mouth, the food was elegant and savory. 

Some exceptional dishes came from restaurants such as Wynn Resort and Casino and Rancho Latino, serving a chicken satay and tres leches, respectively. Both dishes were so delightful that the $125 entrance fee would have paid off only in trying these treats. 

Besides entrées, there were cheeses of all kinds that tasted like they were meant for a king. Cheese and wine is always a fun way to go French for a day. 

The long walk from one tent to an other was exciting and kept me wondering what I would try next. However, even with all the anticipation, I could not help but pull away for a little while to go see chef Emeril Lagasse "bam" all his ingredients in the middle of the festival.

Lagasse's love for the Wine and Food Festival actually pulled him away from New Orleans during Mardi Gras week. He made his trip worthwhile when he put on a typical "Emeril" show - which always had the audience excited and laughing. 

The most scrumptious recipe he taught was lemon crepes. The thin pancakes dipped in a yummy lemon sauce had me salivating.

Once Lagasee finished, I went back to the tents to see what last items I forgot to taste. 

Once the 5 o'clock mark hit, the tents were sadly forced to start clean up and say goodbye to their over-enthusiastic and admiring crowd. 

However, even though the tents would be closing its gates, the shows continued. Rachel Ray drew a large crowd while she gave one of her infamous 30-minute recipes, while Ted Allen - who stars on Bravo's "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" - gave three simple recipes he enjoys such as salmon with roasted vegetables.

The Wine and Food Festival offered quite the experience. For anyone who loves to eat and try new things, the festival is like a dream. The succulent samples will forever stay with me and probably with everyone that attended. 

It's a festival that will have you wanting to return year after year.

Headline: Sushi, tempura worth long wait
Author:  Lalinda De La Fuente / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Japanese cuisine has become popular fare in the last decade with a plethora of restaurants in every nook, cranny and strip mall across the country. Miami is no exception.  With a bevy of Japanese restaurants around every corner, how does one weed out the bad and the ugly from the good and the tasty?

Lost in the glitz of Miami are countless Japanese restaurants with far too much frill, kitsch, stale rice and old seafood; as the market becomes saturated with Japanese fodder, its quality steadily declines. What used to be a sure fire and pleasurable meal has quickly turned into a culinary game of roulette. That's where the low-key, high quality Sushi Joe steps in. This well-known Doral restaurant offers some of the freshest and most authentic sushi and Japanese food.

This locale, which has a mere 10 tables, caters to the individual who wants quality Japanese food at prices that won't break the bank. Their lunch box specials - each running for fewer than $10 each between 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. - fill you up on everything from fresh sushi to tasty tempura and Japanese dumplings.

Joe's sushi is pleasing to the eye as well as the palette. The rice is always moist and the seafood is always fresh. I suggest the squid and the octopus, seafood I usually steer clear from at Japanese restaurants out of fear it will be chewier than a rubber band.  

If sushi is not your style, the extensive menu offers a variety of other traditional Japanese dishes. Their ebi-ten udon features thick wheat noodles with shrimp tempura served in a hot soup. If you prefer rice dishes, the katsu don offers a pork cutlet served with vegetables and egg over Japanese rice. Sushi Joe also has a variety of unique rolls. If you are willing to leave the tried and true California roll behind, the spider roll features fried crispy soft-shelled crab rolled with avocado, asparagus, scallions and crab salad.

A perk to Japanese dining is the opportunity to kick back with some hot sake or a Sapporo, a popular Japanese beer. The desserts are fairly basic but I do suggest the green tea ice cream, a delicious treat that has yet to be truly discovered by the American public.

The ambiance at Sushi Joe is fairly basic and uneventful so you will have to leave the experience to the food. The service at Sushi Joe is very friendly but many times slow when you dine at the peak hours of 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and at around 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. It's especially busy on weekdays at lunchtime when lunch-breakers descend upon the restaurant. Since the locale is small and under-staffed, waiting for your food and a table can, at times, be timely. Nevertheless, the smiling faces and no frills fare make it worth the wait.
