Headline: Maturity, sex, tolerance for alcohol among things learned at FIU dorms
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
I remember the first time I took a commuter friend of mine on a tour of the residence halls during my freshman year - showing her the various lounges, kitchen areas and rooms. Once the tour was finished, I was quite surprised to hear that the only question she had for me was a rather blunt and serious one: "So where does the sex happen?"

After two years of living on campus, this reaction has become a common one, primarily asked by students from FIU's large commuter population. Maybe this is due to the viewing of movies like  "Animal House," "Van Wilder," or "Road Trip" that depict a hormone-driven image of college dorm life ruled by orgies, drug revelries, alcohol binges and a series of irresponsible misadventures. Or maybe it could be because the image, however exaggerated Hollywood has made it, is partly true.

So far I've lived in only two of the four residence areas at University Park, Panther Hall and the UP Apartments. Though PH is now the official freshman-only building, it used to have quite a mix of students, both graduate and undergraduate, especially in the Honors College wing. It was in this particular residence hall (this is the title FIU has given to the dorms) that I encountered my first glimpses of the college life.

The first fact to learn is that there's always something happening in the residence halls. Whereas most of UP slips into a dull period of inactivity once the evening hours have set in, night-time ushers a flurry of noise and events within the buildings that shouldn't be missed, especially on the weekends. 

At these times the doors of rooms are always opened. The sounds of hip hop or salsa blasts through the halls as students dressed in their finest clothes await the late-night party and clubbing hours.

Sometimes, the parties are cautiously brought into the rooms, with students trying their best not to attract the attention of the resident assistants who monitor the hallways. This careful avoidance of the sole authority figures within the buildings has been turned into a game by some, seeing who can break the most rules without getting caught. 

As part of this game, I've seen a group of girls trying to hide a giant snapping turtle in their room (they wanted to keep the wild creature as a pet); guys carrying clinking liquor bottles in garbage bags, which they call trash, though they're suspiciously taking the bags into the room instead of out; students of both sexes bringing in "friends" past midnight through secret side entrances, telling the guest that this will be the exit they will quietly take in the morning; and other instances of silent misrule that have become the stuff of dorm legend.

This kind of subversion does not happen in every building, though. It is known by most resident students that each part of housing carries its own rules and even personality. In my opinion, it is the UP Apartments that have the best characteristics.

Many would refer the UPA as being the most peaceful of the residence halls, a title that could be a little misleading. Besides the fact that the apartments are set near a serene lake and contain some of the most scenic parts on campus, I take 'peaceful' to mean that there's little outside interference, giving students more independence than in the other residence halls, and thus, more opportunities to live life how they choose.

Here, parties are a more common occurrence, resulting in a higher percentage of brawls and police intervention than the other buildings. There are no secret entrances here because the apartments are spread out around a large area. 

However, because most of the students in UPA are usually older and have already experienced a large portion of the college life, the revelries there are mostly contained, the RA cat and mouse game replaced with a quiet understanding: They'll leave you to your business if you leave them to theirs.

The wild scents of on-campus living are those of cigarette smoke, urine-soaked staircases, midnight vomit, the humidity of balloon fights, unwashed sheets and decaying pizza boxes. I will miss it all once my college career is over and I'm forced to move out on my own. At no other time in a student's life will the phrase "seize the day" mean so much as it does now, and, as paradoxical as it may sound, it is through the excesses of those days that students experiencing parental independence for the first time learn moderation. 

There is no life like that of living on-campus, and I recommend it to all students, whether they move here from Alaska or live right across from the eighth street entrance.

Subheadline: Team deep at running back, special teams a concern 
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The football program has come a long way since its inauguration in 2002. Just three seasons gone by, the Golden Panthers will play Division I-A football against some of the top programs in the nation this season.

"This is where we wanted to head and I've always said to be the best, you've got to play the best," said head coach Don Strock. "This can only help us as far as recruiting and fan interest is concerned.  We're definitely headed in the right direction."

This season, FIU will play prestigious programs such as 2003 Big 12 champions Kansas State in the season opener on Sept. 3 and last year's Sun Belt Conference champions North Texas on Oct. 15.

The team will also play five home games, including a must-watch opener against Florida A & M and Sun-Belt Conference foes Western Kentucky and Middle-Tennessee. 

"I think this is a great schedule with a couple of highly regarded opponents at the top," Strock said.

Playing in the top division of NCAA football will get the football program more exposure than they have ever received.  

Three games are scheduled to appear on ESPN Regional and the November 12 road game at Louisiana-Lafayette available on Comcast.  

Associate Athletic Director Gregg Fort couldn't be more pleased with the opportunity.

"We appreciate the opportunity for additional TV exposure and the chance to showcase our football team and our university," Fort said. 

Under the bright lights of division one football, the FIU program must take it's game to a new level and Strock has the biggest task on his hands.

The Golden Panthers will return 18 starters and are coming off a 3-7 season where they were outscored 193-50. in the second half.

As training camp winds down and the season opener draws closer, the coaching staff is looking for depth in their roster and much-needed consistency in their play.

"Every excuse we've made in the past has been because of our inexperience or lack of maturity. We can't say that anymore," said senior center Victor Cernius. 

With all the guys hyped up about playing in a big stage and a new group of young talent mixed with cagey veterans, this football season proves to be an exciting one. Here's a breakdown of the team and what to expect.



QUARTERBACK



Junior Josh Padrick - coming off a season where he completed just over fifty percent of his passes, and threw 13 picks with 12 touchdowns - will start at quarterback once again.

Padrick will also get plenty of help off the bench.

He will be backed up by senior QB David Tabor - who threw for almost 200 yards in 28 attempts last season - and freshman Tommy Kendrick.

Inaugural season starting quarterback Jamie Burke has also returned to the team after tearing his ACL for the third time in 2003 and giving up football. He is currently making strides to make the final roster and hope to see some playing time once again.

"I came down to help coach but after a few days out there it hit me - the urge to play again," Burke said.

No matter how big his urge is, Strock guarantees no special treatment for the senior quarterback.

"Jamie is a great young man who has a firm knowledge of our system, but he's not going to just step in and have a position," Strock said. "He's going to have to work for everything he gets."



Half backs



Despite losing leading rusher and All Sun-Belt Conference selectee Rashod Smith, the Golden Panthers running game is not at all depleted.

Julias Reams, a redshirt freshman out of Coral Reef high school, is physically bigger than Smith and is said to be the perfect aspect for Strock's one-back philosophy.

Backing him up will be last year's leading-rusher-not-named-Smith, Ben West freshman A'mod Ned, who lead Broward with 1,635 yards and 25 touchdowns. Ned has made big strides by performing well during practice thus far and is vying for the backup role.

These players have a lot to make up after Smith rushed for 1100 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2004.  They may not equal his success, but they can hold their own.



 RECEIVERS



A big area of concern on offense is the wide-receiver position. Although they will return their leading receiver - senior Cory McKinney (58 catches for 675 yards and four touchdowns last season) - they lose Harold Leath, the second-leading receiver last season.

Filling the holes at the number two receiver will be senior Andre Rollins, who pulled in just four catches for sixty five yards last season. Also in the mix is  speedster Chandler Williams.

Rollins' play will be crucial this season as he will line up opposite Cory McKinney and try to loosen up coverage for the leading receiver. If he makes plays and gets open, it will expand the offense and give Padrick more options to throw to instead of having McKinney under double coverage all the time.

At tight end, leading the pack is junior Samuel Smith who stands at 6'3" and weighs 253 pounds. He led FIU tight ends last year with 42 catches for 110 yards and three touchdowns. He proved a big target down field for Padrick and Tabor.



OFFENSIVE LINE



The true test this season will be given to the offensive line. Big I-A schools have bigger and faster defensive lineman and our offensive line has a tough task ahead of them.

Lead by center Victor Cernius, the O-line has a lot of experience with four of their five starters being seniors. They know the offense well and should be experienced enough to do a respectable job, but these guys have a lot of work to do if they want to match up against the big boys of the NCAA.

SPECIAL TEAMS  



After being the leading kickoff returner last season,  Chandler Williams will look to do punt return duties as well.

Williams did a fine job last season as a kickoff returner, averaging nearly 22 yards per kick (he got only one opportunity as a punt returner).

The Golden Panthers will return Adam Moss at kicker. The senior missed four field goals from inside 30 yards last season and ended up hitting on just 68 percent of his opportunities.

The team will look for more consistency out of their veteran kicker.

Last year's punter Doug Jones is gone and Dustin Rivest has been recruited out of Tallahassee. Currently, he and Junior Chris Patullo are competing for the starting spot.



DEFENSE



The defense is a big area of concern coming into the season. Eight starters will return from last year's squad as they hope to rebound from a disappointing season.

Leading the defense will be All Sun-Belt Conference Preseason selection Nick Turnbull. Turnbull lead the Golden Panthers in interceptions with 5  - one of which was returned for touchdown - and was third on the team in tackles with 74.

On the bright side, FIU will return eight  of last year's top 10 tacklers, including second leading tackler and senior linebacker Lance Preston.

But don't be fooled: this defense has a lot to improve upon if they want to be competitive this season. They gave up nearly twice as many touchdowns on the ground than their opponents and recorded half as many interceptions. 

Giving up nearly 33 points a game simply will not cut it. The defense will need to step it up big if the teams expects to have success.  But a bad defense playing against tougher competition will not equal success.  This will be an area that will suffer throughout the course of the year.

FIU is deep at the linebacker position, a position that needs to lead the team in tackles. The last three seasons, a safety had led the team in tackles - something that needs to change.

Headline: Depth and experience provide formula for QB success
Author: Sergio Carmona
&nbsp;
One of the strongest compliments that could be given to the growth of the football program as it prepares for its fourth season, and first in Division 1-A, is the interest in learning that the quarterbacks have invested. 

The experience of junior starter Josh Padrick and senior backup David Tabor, as well as Jamie Burke's comeback, provide excellent experience and leadership to the freshmen and sophomores.

"[The underclassmen] listen to what Josh and David have to say," said offensive coordinator Greg Briner. "They all learn from one another and they're very good friends. And they share information."

This cohesive quarterback unit received a boost last year when Padrick demonstrated an encouraging sign of his maturity with a passing efficiency of 113.74 and an improved completion percentage of 56.7 - up from 49 percent in 2003. 

His improvements, and two seasons under his belt, provide the team with the confidence it needs for a successful season.

"I think anytime the quarterback plays well, the team plays well," said head coach Don Strock. "It's important [that Padrick] keeps progressing, you learn something new everyday, whether life or sport and football is no difference."

Padrick has also excelled brilliantly as a leader on the team, capable of grooming the younger players. 

"Padrick was great for me last year. I was pretty much looking up to him," said redshirt freshman Tavares Kendrick. "He taught me a couple of things that I didn't know and blitzes and coverages that I didn't know."

Being the starting quarterback as a junior places a high demand on Padrick to lead this team.

"Last year he was kind of a young guy," Tabor said. "Now that he's getting older and we have the young guys coming in to look up to him for leadership, he has to be a leader because he's a general of this team."

Padrick's fire and desire are key components to his success.

"As long as I've know him, he's one of the toughest guys I know and one of the most competitive that I know, " Tabor said. "He wouldn't give up on himself and most importantly, his teammates."

Padrick passed for 2,269 yards with 203 completions, 12 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions last season. 

He also threw extremely well during spring practices, where he implemented new techniques to improve his efficiency.

"Coach had us do a lot of drills," Padrick said. "Where we stride less with front legs to stand tall in the pocket and have a higher release to get ball over. [As well as] a lot of footwork, and drills to help inside the pocket and get out of there if we need it." 

Padrick's helpful spring would turn out to be a good factor if it carries on into the season.

"Spring helped a lot. Coach Strock and Coach Briner stressed reading defenses and knowing what you do at all times [so we can] make less mistakes," Padrick said.

Padrick is also excited to face the Division 1-A defenses.

"I expect to see a little more speed [and] more physical defenses because they're not the same," he said. 

Padrick's back up is the highly dependable Tabor, the first player to sign for FIU. Tabor's experience includes a comeback win coming off the bench against Youngstown State.

 With the Golden Panthers down, 16-3, Tabor came into the game and completed 15-of-22 passes for 174 yards and three touchdowns, leading his team to a 22-16 overtime win. 

Tabor's ability to advise Padrick has paid great dividends.

"Padrick needs help. He needs guidance. There are things he can't see because he's in the heat of the passion of the game. He needs another pair of eyes," Tabor said.

Tabor's experience with the playbook will also serve as a valuable asset in cultivating the young players, such as Kendrick and freshman Paul McCall, as he strongly encourages them to study it very hard. 

"It's complicated at first, but it's pretty vanilla once you learn it, grasp the main concepts and everything pretty much flows together," Tabor said.

The veteran leadership has been a blessing for red shirt freshman quarterback Tavares Kendrick, who sat out last year learning the offense.

"It was great. Last year was a learning experience. There were a lot of things I didn't know that I thought I knew. The certain things I didn't know, I applied to the things that I knew and it [worked out] for the best," Kendrick said.

Kendrick was ranked the number one quarterback for the state of Florida. Kendrick is expected to spend another year learning from the sideline and should be ready for action next season, where he could possibly challenge for the starting job. 

The veteran leadership of Padrick, Tabor and Burke, as well as Kendrick's willingness to learn, provide the blueprints to a successful season from the quarterback position.

Headline: Future of Golden Panther running game in good hands
Author: Joshua Rey / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There will be a sense of unfamiliarity in the air Sept. 3 when the football team steps onto Wagner Field to take on Kansas State.  

Facing a Big 12 opponent in front of 50,000 maniacal fans, the Golden Panthers will be without reliable running back Rashod Smith for the first time in school history. Smith, who graduated earlier this year, will not be lacing up.

Despite the bad news, a plethora of talented running backs have emerged. Surprisingly, it is a redshirt freshman, Julian Reams, who finds himself at the head of the class.  Despite a lack of game experience, Reams showed plenty of poise during a scrimmage this past Spring.  

"Take the rock," Smith told Reams from the sideline.  "It's your turn now."  

Reams obliged, carrying the ball 16 times for 102 yards and a touchdown, catching the eye of his teammates and head coach Don Strock.  

"Julian Reams, when given the opportunity, went from a guy who was kind of not sure what to do, to a guy who really makes few mistakes right now," Strock said.  "He's a guy who we're counting on heavily."

Reams brought his springtime momentum with him to summer practices, splitting the slightest of seams on the defensive line and breaking runs open on a regular basis.  Despite his success on the practice field, the soft-spoken Reams has remained humble, seeking advice from his experienced teammates.  

"What people have been telling me is that the first two series, the game speed is going to be way quicker," said Reams.  "But it slows down and you're gonna catch up with it."

Battling with Reams for the starting spot is a familiar face, sophomore Ben West. Reams and West competed against one another in a heated district rivalry when Reams played at Coral Reef High and West starred at Homestead High.  Now teammates, these running backs have set a common goal.  

"We're gonna have each other's back no matter what," Reams said.  "We want to be the new Ronnie [Brown] and Cadillac [Williams]."  

Emulating the tandem that wreaked havoc on opposing run defenses for Auburn University a season ago could fill FIU Stadium with some much-needed excitement.

West showed glimpses of greatness as a freshman in 2004, boasting a 6.2 yards/rush average as Rashod Smith's backup.  He values the time spent learning behind FIU's two-time Most Valuable Player.  

"By playing with guys like Rashod Smith and Adam Gorman, the upper class helped me out on certain plays, certain areas [and] certain people I had to block," West said.  

The dark horse in the running back race is true freshman A'mod Ned.  Ned may have the best chance of filling Rashod Smith's cleats, literally.  Both men stand 5'9" and weigh less than 200 pounds.  

But on the football field, Ned is his own man. In his final two seasons of high school football, Ned was the most elite back in Broward County. During that time, Ned rushed for over 3,000 yards and scored a mind-boggling 41 touchdowns.  Ned will get the chance to shine in 2005.

And who can forget Adam Gorman?  The senior leader of the backfield, Gorman has been a workhorse for FIU since day one.  He earned FIU Offensive Player of the Year honors in 2003 after rushing for 736 yards with eight touchdowns.  

Quite possibly the most versatile Golden Panther, Gorman can also be found on the special teams unit, hustling to the ball and making open field tackles.  His experience at the tailback and fullback positions makes him an integral part of the team.

"Both positions run the ball, both positions block and both positions catch, so it's basically all the same to me," Gorman said. "Whatever the coaches need me to do, I'm willing to do."  

Running backs coach Tony Nathan appreciates the example Gorman is setting for younger members of the FIU backfield.  

"Adam is our go-to guy when we need someone to know what to do and how we want to get things done," said Nathan.  "When things don't go well with somebody else, you know that you can put him at both spots.  He's a great asset to have."  

Expect to see number 44 lining up at fullback this season, making the switch to tailback in 3rd down situations, and sprinting down the sidelines on the kickoff and punt teams.  

Despite a difficult schedule, FIU's running backs have one thing in mind.  

"To win," Gorman said bluntly.  "We're 1-A now; we don't really count the I-AA schools, the Jacksonvilles and stuff like that. We've surpassed that level."  

"As long as we do our job one play at a time, everything else will come into play," Reams added.

With four dynamic running backs fighting for playing time behind a stellar offensive line, the future of FIU's ground game is very bright.  So FIU football fans sit back and relax.  

The ball is in good hands.

Game 1 Vs. Youngstown
FIU 22, YSU 16
Game recap: Thanks to a Don Strock-like performance from quarterback David Tabor and a record-setting night by tight end Sam Smith, FIU overcame a 13-3 3rd quarter deficit en route to a 22-16 overtime win over the Penguins. Tabor led the team to a fourth quarter comeback with an impressive 15-of-22, three touchdown relief effort, stepping in for Josh Padrick.
The triumph also marks the first FIU win over a scholarship opponent, first in overtime and first over a member of the Gateway Conference, having dropped previous contests to Western Kentucky and Indiana State.

Game 2 Vs. Lousiana-Lafayette
Ul 43, FIU 34
Game recap: The Ragin' Cajun spoiled FIU's home opener scoring nine points in the last 25 seconds of the fourth quarter en route to a 43-34 victory in front of 10,022 at FIU Stadium.
Missed opportunities hurt FIU throughout the game, something that frustrated head coach Don Strock.
"Obviously we didn't get it done. We had opportunities and we didn't take advantage of them," Strock said after the game.

Game 3 Vs. Stephen F. Austin
FIU 31, SFA 24
Game recap: The Golden Panthers traveled to Homer Bryce Stadium in hopes of picking up their second win of the season and first in school history against a ranked opponent - the team did just that as FIU was able to hold on and defeat Stephen F. Austin 31-24.

Headline: Linebacker Antwan Barnes loves running his mouth
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
If you're close enough to the sidelines, you might hear some players trash talking. If you look deep enough, you might notice it's one player in particular - No. 45.

The number belongs to third-year player Antwan Barnes. The 6'1'' linebacker has been a consistent player since his freshman year, when he started all 12 games for FIU. 

Out of Norland High School, Barnes was an all-state first-team linebacker and was listed among the Miami Herald's Top-20 players in Miami-Dade County.

Known for his blazing speed, Barnes will look to make an impact this season on a defense corps that looks to be the strength of the team.

Q: The football program is entering its fourth year and first with a full Division I-A schedule. What can fans expect of the team?

We have a mind set to win this year. We will also be facing a better competition of teams.

Q: How many wins will the team finish with this year?

I'm not going to say, I just want to win. This year we should have a winning season.

Q: People don't know how hard and long you guys practice. What's the most intense practice you guys have had under head coach Don Strock?

This whole camp, coaches have worked us even harder than last year. We've had more running and lifting. The hardest part is working on individuals, which are when all the linebackers do drills that include lots of footwork thinking and running.

Q: How does your body feel the day after a football game?

It's the worst feeling. It's like if you had just gone through a boxing match and your whole body feels beat up from head to toe.

Q: You're known for trash talking. Is there a lot of trash talking during the games?

I'm the biggest trash talker on the team. I get that a lot. That's just me, that's how I play the game. I know how to do it to and how far to take it. That's how I keep myself hyped the entire game.

Q: Many other universities recruited you out of high school, including teams such as Miami, Michigan State and LSU. Why did you choose to be a Golden Panther?

I wanted to go to a school that wanted me the most and the opportunity where I would play. FIU stayed with me the whole way. 

Q: Who's the best player on the team?

Not one player, but the entire defensive unit. We can step it up a lot this year. As far as individuals that are shining, I have to go with receiver Chandler Williams. You never know what to expect from him cause he's so quick and breaks move at the last second.

Q: Who are the best and worst dressed players on the team?

Worst - it has to be me 'cause during camp I don't care what I wear. The best is probably Julius Eppinger. In his closet, all he has is good clothes.

Q: If your house was on fire and you could only go back and get three material things - assuming your family is safe - what would you get?

My state championship ring from high school, a family photo album and my R&B CD's.

Q: Would you shed three years of your life for an NCAA title with FIU?

I definitely would. There's only one champion. It proves you're the best team in the country and your name goes in the record books.

Q: FIU is once again a team featured on NCAA Football 2006 for video game consoles. How does it feel to use yourself?

It feels cool. There are still some things they need to change but I love it. You don't need to create yourself nor a team anymore.

Headline: Wins, not effort, will make football season a success
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
The football season is set to begin, so here is what the football team faces.

The Golden Panthers are opening the season against Kansas State - a team that went to 11 straight bowl games between 1993 and 2003. 

The team will follow that  with a match up against Texas Tech,  a team that debuted No. 21 in the ESPN/Coaches Pre-Season Top 25 poll and are fresh off a 45-31 win over then fourth-ranked California in the 2004 Pacific Life Holiday Bowl.

The schedule also includes a full slate of Sun Belt Conference teams, including cross-town rival Florida Atlantic, which FIU is 0-3 against. The Golden Panthers finished 3-7 last season, only a slight improvement over the 2-10 mark of the previous year.

As you read this, you may ask yourself: What mess did the program get into? Are the Golden Panthers heading toward a disaster season?

Well, ladies and gentlemen, the answer is yes, but there still may be light at the end of the tunnel. It's hard to imagine the team will win more than a couple of games, but this does not mean the team will not be a good one to watch.

Despite their losing record and disappointing defeats, there is one thing that I have always admired about our football team - their effort. No matter how big, strong and experienced opponents have been in the past, FIU players have never been intimidated, and more importantly, they have never given up. However, wins will make the season, not their effort.

The team lost a few key players due to graduation, including 1,000-yard rusher Rashod Smith and reliable receiver Harold Leath. 

Another big loss the team will face is the absence of John Haritan, the team's leading tackler since its inaugural season. Haritan decided to end his college football career due to injuries.

In spite of all this, FIU still has some very good players and they should be able to compete in every game. The question will be whether or not they can keep up with opposing teams for more than four quarters.

The Golden Panthers did not win many games last season, but they were in many ball games all the way to the end. It's nice to see that they can keep up with good teams, but victories are what need to be delivered. 

No one remembers that the team was a field goal away from winning or that a miscommunication on offense cost the team  the game. All people remember are the wins and losses. This is the year the team must start winning if they want fans to attend games.

Head coach Don Strock's excuses in the past have always been that the team was too young and that inexperience played a role in the team's loss.FAU has delivered the past two seasons. They are only one year ahead of FIU, yet it almost feels like five. 

After four seasons of football and with its first ever-senior class, Strock will no longer be able to use these excuses. 

There are good players on the team and they must play well in order for the team to succeed. Quarterback Josh Padrick must improve his completion percentage and throw more touchdowns than interceptions. Cory McKinney and Samuel Smith must continue to be effective on the receiving end.

On defense, the linebacker corps of Antwan Barnes and Lance Preston should account for the majority of the team's tackles, not the teams secondary like they have done in the past.

With  last year's attendance nowhere near the 15,000 requirement, and having a much tougher schedule, FIU must start winning, and rather sooner than later. If victories do not happen early on in the season, fans will not attend the games and the season will be a disappointment.

Headline: FIU takes safety precautions by keeping track of sexual offenders on campus and providing students with information via website
Author: Editorial
&nbsp;
As the university continues to investigate whether campus police officer Frederick Currie sexually assaulted an 18-year-old woman off campus last July, one of several questions comes to mind: Does FIU keep track of how many convicted sexual offenders are employees or students on campus?

The Beacon asked the university to produce a list of registered sexual offenders that are working or enrolled in classes at FIU. In less than 24 hours, Captain Michael Wright responded to the request. 

Not only does FIU keep proper track of how many registered sexual offenders are on campus, but the list is made available to the general public via the FIU campus police website. 

Four men are listed as convicted sexual offenders. However, there is no way of knowing from the website which of the four are students and which are employees. 

The university should be praised for making this information readily available to the university population in a time where even 9-year-olds have been convicted for committing sex crimes in south Florida.

Other universities aren't so open with this information. In fact, the University of Miami site simply links visitors to the state's sexual offender website, which can give you more information on sexual offenders in your area, but not necessarily on campus.

This website should be checked on a regular basis. Apparently, it is legal for convicted sexual offenders to be employees or students at FIU. Students registered as sexual offenders and are applying to the university must go through the Judicial Services department for admission. 

Officials there evaluate the students before admitting them into the university.

It is clear that the university is taking serious precautions in having sexual offenders on campus. Those precautions should give FIU students and employees a greater sense of security on campus in regard to sexual predators.

Headline: Freshman conquers embarrasment and myths during summer
Author: Ashley Capo
&nbsp;
Walking into the Graham Center was not as easy as I first thought. 

Coming from high school, I expected this building to be smaller, but no, I was unpleasantly surprised. 

It was huge! The onl y thing running through my mind was, "I'm a freshman again, I now have to deal with  the annoying upperclassmen pestering me about some pool on the roof and the mean professors that hate freshman." My first impression was a lonely one. 

Who in this entire campus was going to help me get around? Am I too going to feel the wrath of sleeping through most of orientation? 

I calmly took a deep breath, and entered GC with nothing less than thousands of butterflies in my stomach leading me down the endless halls.

The first day of my very first semester as a freshman was exactly how I pictured it: completely horrifying. 

Not only did I go into the wrong building, but I sat in the class I was scheduled to go to at 12:30 p.m. and it was only 8 a.m. 

I don't think you understand me when I say, I sat in on almost 15 minutes of a class I wasn't even taking! 

Once I noticed that the teacher was not talking about math, I stood up, very noticeably, and ran out of the classroom to the Charles Perry Building where I was 20 minutes late to my first class. 

By the time I found the class, I was panting. I looked as if the university had let loose a pack of wild ostriches after me from the nature preserve on campus. 

You better believe the entire class took the time to watch me in my glory find a seat in the back of the room. That day was, by far, one of the most mortifying of my education.

The first couple of days were also really hard. None of my friends were enrolled in Summer B, I had just learned to drive my car so I didn't feel comfortable leaving campus, and I had three hours between classes to do absolutely nothing by myself. 

I was really uncomfortable in my own silence. I relaxed in the bookstore every day between my classes and sat in the giant comfy chairs with a Java chip frapuccino in one hand and a US Weekly in the other. 

After the first few days, I noticed that I was not the only regular to come to this very spot in the store. 

I started talking to other freshmen who wandered there for a place to go and I quickly made friends. 

My little hideaway became my entrance to the world of college life. 

Now I am six weeks more experienced with FIU's student culture, and, I must admit, it was not always easy. I learned the hard way that college is not high school, at all. No older students treated me like a freshman, and everyone was willing to help me out if I needed help finding a class or if I just needed to be social. 

For the first time since middle school, I took the time to study for tests and I wrote the best essays I've ever written in my ENC 1102 class. 

I also got to know the library better than any other building on campus. 

So if you're an anxious, ignorant freshman like I was, don't fret. 

You are not alone and there are people everywhere willing to help you. 

All of the students are here to learn, just like you, and we've all had the first time jitters. Luckily, it will soon pass, and when that happens, you'll see the fantastic opportunities that await you. 

Welcome class of 2009. Let's make these next four years the greatest years of our lives.

Headline: Decline in ACT scores continues nation-wide
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
According to a report by ACT Inc., hundreds of thousands of this year's college-bound high school graduates aren't prepared enough academically to succeed in college.

ACT Inc., a non-profit testing company, stated in its report that the average national composite scores of the ACT college entrance exam remained unchanged from last year. The score, 20.9 out of 36 possible points, did not change, despite a record number of test-takers.

The ACT test is administered in 50 states and accepted by most universities. Nearly 1.2 million students who graduated from high school this year took the test.

At FIU, the ACT requirement is a minimum score of 21, but according to admissions counselor Alayne Richardson, a student's transcripts and grade point average are important in the university's decision to accept a student. 

"We look at high school transcripts, a 3.0 GPA and either the ACT or SAT [score]," she said.

The report also states that scores in various subject areas suggest that many  college students are likely to need some remedial attention. 

Just over half (51 percent) had scores high enough to suggest they could succeed in college-level social science courses. But, about half of test-takers lack at least some reading-comprehension skills, suggesting they would struggle in courses such as history, sociology or literature

"Testing scores don't mean anything. I did not have the strongest ACT scores but my grades at FIU have always been good and stable," said junior Christine Guzman. "Those scores don't mean anything."

More students seem to agree.

"My score was not high enough to be accepted directly to the fall, so I came to the Summer semester first. As a freshman, I passed all my classes and earned good grades. A test score does not tell you the effort and dedication of a person," said sophomore Rebecca Casas.

Headline: President answers tough questions
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
The Beacon's Editor in Chief Harry Coleman sat down with President Modesto A. Maidique in his first full-length interview with The Beacon in over a year. This is the first of a three part series where Maidique discuses residential life, the medical school, FIU in China, FIU football, Biscayne Bay Campus, his hobbies and life when he was college student.

Q. In an article we published on new campus housing, Jim Wassenaar, director for the Office of Student Affairs, Auxiliaries, and Operations stated: "The objective of the president's plan is that 20 percent of the university's enrolled students live on-campus within the next 10 years." Currently, only 10 percent of students live on campus, most of them at UP. Why do you want this great push for an increase in residential students? How will it benefit the university? 

FIU wants to be able to cater both to the traditional students that would like the traditional college experience with dorm and a lot of activities on campus as well as to the commuter students who because of family and work consideration only have a limited amount of time. We are working hard to create an equivalent level of experience to those students that like the athletics, tailgating, parties, fraternities, dances on campus and social clubs. We feel that a critical mass somewhere in the order of several thousand students is the right number for us. The number will be in part guided by the demand. Right now our dorms are full and we feel that when we open the new dorms, those [too] will be full.

Q. In Nov., FIU administrators will travel to Jacksonville to meet with the Board of Governors and finally receive the answer they've been waiting for 10 years: Will FIU get the medical school. What will be the first step the university will take if the program is approved? 

If we get a green light, then we will be given the opportunity to work with the legislature. Hopefully the next people there will be from Miami. We'll have four years with two wonderful leading members from the Florida legislature who will be from Miami. But we need what you call the fishing license from the Board of Governors. We need to hire a dean that will lead us because we have consultants and in house expertise but we don't have a dean that will be the person that will build the school.

Q. If approved, which hospitals will the university partner with?

We are working with numerous hospitals but two key partners are the hospitals that already have undergraduate licenses - Mount Sinai and Miami Children's Hospital but [these two] are not enough to deal with the demand we will have for residence and opportunity for our students to practice so Mercy is an important part of the equation. There will probably be other hospitals involved also.

Q. What will happen to all the grants and loans that the university has accumulated for the project if the school is not approved?

The grants that we have received are for research. If we are turned down, we will go back and then if we are turned down again, we will go back. We were turned down for the Law School for 12 years and we kept going back.

Q. Football is entering its first year of a full Division I-A schedule. Fans are not going to the stadium and winning might take a few more years. What are the goals for this program after the program did not accomplish the 15,000-goal requirement last year?

I hope that this year we can merge the gap between 10,000 average and 15,000. I'm not looking for a 50 percent increase but I'm looking for 20, 25 percent increase.

Look for the second part of  The Beacon's interview with Maidique  in our next issue.

Headline: International students lack attention
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Many may not know that the 'I' in FIU stands for International, due to the efforts of Charles E. Perry, the university's first president, who envisioned a college so steeped in South Florida's cultural diversity that it would attract students from all over the world.

However, as the decades since Perry's presidency have passed, some are not pleased by the role given to international students within the university today.

"These students came all the way across the world to study here, but they are not given the attention they deserve," said Providence Okoye, chair of the Student Government Association's international students committee.

Okoye, a Nigerian citizen who has been living in the U.S. since joining FIU in 2003, argues that offices like the International Student and Scholar Services haven't been doing enough or to either facilitate the entrance of foreign students into the country or help them adapt once they are here.

"When you're new to a country, you should be able to adapt quickly; you should not be pushed from one place to another while not being given the answers to your problems," she said. "We're special students and we sometimes need more help than others, but we just don't receive it."

Ana Sippin, director of the ISSS, disagrees, stating that FIU's international student's policy, though not as prominent as it used to be, is still making room for improvements.

"Once a student is admitted, we help take care of their immigration process; we register them with the Student Exchange Visitor Information, which is mandatory; and we provide orientation sessions before classes start," Okoye said. "We do a very thorough job in dealing with all the paperwork aspects of incoming students."

The ISSS has also re-established the International Student Club as well as opening membership to Phi Beta Delta, a national honorary council for upper division or graduate students, faculty and staff interested in international education.

Still, Sippin notes that a lack of support for the international students program may be attributed to the drop of foreign enrollment seen by the school in the past semesters.

"Our numbers aren't as high as they've were three years ago, but that's been the situation in most universities throughout the country," Sippin said.

Although the enrollment numbers for the 2005/2006 school year will not be known for another two months, past data shows that there were a total of 2,891 international students representing 126 countries enrolled last year.

In 2003, there were 2,920 international students.

"There are various reasons for this drop, it can't be just pinned to one specific reason," Sippin said.

Among these, she mentioned the fear of international terrorism that spreads around the globe after the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and the changes in immigration regulations that occurred here after the incident.

"People from other countries are now afraid to come or send their kids here," she said.

Okoye, however, states that there may be other reasons beside the current global political problems.

"In the past, people said it was because of 9/11. But some years have passed since then, and there have to be other reasons why we aren't drawing so many students as before."

Both Okoye and Sippin agree that the continual increase in tuition could also be a factor.

This scholastic year, international students will pay the equivalent of out-of-state tuition for both the graduate and undergraduate levels. 

Students will also have to pay for a mandatory insurance charge, as well as books and other academic expenses, resulting in an estimated amount of  $32,254 for undergraduates.

"Our tuition for undergraduates is pretty normal right now, though graduate levels have gone up," Sippin said. "However, that can be expected from a metropolitan university like FIU where insurance charges are high, living expenses are high and everything is just pricier, like in other schools in Los Angeles or New York."

Despite these factors, Okoye has proposed that recruitment in other countries be set as a priority by the Office of Admissions, with current international students answering questions submitted by people from their own nation.

"Student involvement will help bring attention to FIU, even though we have all these factors working against us," she said.

Sippin agreed, stating that emphasizing Miami's diversity would appeal to more foreign students, thus boosting the prestige of the program within the university.

"One positive thing for international students coming to FIU is that this school is already international, even with students who are not, per se, international students, because people are here from all different countries. They may be residents or citizens, or maybe they're born here, but they come from other places," she said.

Okoye herself hopes that an increase in international student enrollment will bring awareness of their differences and needs to the rest of the school.

"Yes, things will probably be getting better soon. I have already seen some changes in the way things are done," she said. "A friend told me this will be the international student year, and I think it is true. People will finally notice that we contribute to the school as well, and that we are a part of what makes FIU the university that it is - diverse and international."

Headline: Housing overload; renovations expected
Author: Atheena Johnson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the news that on-campus housing at the University Park campus was fully occupied, the student resident population began to worry.

The housing office at UP stopped accepting applications for housing in early July, which over the following months created a 500 person waiting list that is still growing. 

James Wassenaar, executive director of student affairs, and housing coordinators had previously anticipated that this would happen, and planned to divert students to the Biscayne Bay Campus on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Several students were diverted to BBC in an effort to ensure on-campus housing. Sixty-five first-time freshman students and 20 transfer students were given the option of residing at Bay Vista. After accepting the offer, they were also given the opportunity to attend an orientation at BBC. 

"The purpose of the second orientation was to allow the students to get accustomed to the campus and finding their way around, along with rescheduling their classes at BBC," Wassenaar said. "We worked with registration so that all classes that freshmen need are also on the BBC. Special advising was available for those students so they can redo their schedule."

Due to the overflow of applications for housing at BBC, Bay Vista housing is near full capacity, at 93 percent occupancy. 

However, this is not unusual because Bay Vista has always had high occupancy in previous years, according to Wassenaar.

"It was just last year that Bay Vista took a dip in its residents," Wassenaar said.

During the past years there have been several plans to renovate the housing on BBC. 

The most recent landscaping  implemented was the planting of palm trees. Several palm trees were planted along the housing building and also throughout the outside patio area. 

Wassenaar also plans to add a patio and glider chairs in that area. 

"We want to improve the aesthetics of the campus. We want students to enjoy the area that they live in. Our desire is to get students to understand that we have a wonderful facility on BBC," he said.

  Ro-Ann Royer, BBC's Residential Life Coordinator, agreed.

"I think Bay Vista Housing is a wonderful and friendly community to live in. It gives BBC the opportunity to be more than a commuter campus," Royer said.

Tiffany Simmons transferred last year and has since been living on campus. She has taken notice of the changes taking place on BBC. 

"I think all of the renovations will benefit the residents, it helps students feel better when they come to their dorm and it looks nice, also we really need the software, a lot of residents use the computer lab so that will really help," Simmons said.

Concurrently, UP is expected to open the doors of a new housing facility called Lakeview at the start of the 2006 Fall semester. Lakeview is expected to house a total of 825 residents. 

Housing officials hope that it will address the current issue of on-campus housing availability. 

This is a relief to a large number of students because it will lessen the stress of worrying about getting a room on campus.

"The waiting period was kind of stressful because even though I had lived on campus before and I had priority, it wasn't a guarantee that I would get [in]," said Monique Tavares, a second-year resident.

One worry that student residents have is transportation, not only between both campuses, but also to nearby areas. 

Wassenaar mentions that there is the shuttle that travels between the two campuses and on top of that there is a transit bus that runs specially for housing students, which is available at BBC.

"We have a shuttle that can take students to the shopping malls and surrounding areas [and] we want to expand that service so we are conducting surveys to better find out what suits the majority of the students," Wassenaar said. "The plan is to increase the days that the shuttle runs from one day to two days of the week."

Housing officials are currently working with student services and residential life to prepare activities to ensure students will have a gratifying on-campus experience.

"We are very excited to welcome our students back for the Fall term. Housing and residential life has made many plans to make sure they have a successful year, both academically, and enjoying all of the campus amenities and programs," Wassenaar said.

Headline: Hottest BBC hangouts
Author: Bettina Lett / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Being new to the Biscayne Bay Campus means that finding things to do on your off time could be stressful, but fear not. Below are some ideas of different locations and hot spots to attend to spice up the night life or perk up the daytime.

The Movies 

The movie theaters around BBC are key for dates and student hangouts. The Aventura Mall's AMC theatres, located on the third level of the mall would be an excellent choice. It offers an automated box office and stadium seating with reclining seats. Student tickets are sold at $7 and adult tickets for $9. It's just 10 minutes north of BBC.

Another great place for movie-goers is Crown Theaters. Ticket prices for students are a bargain at $6.25 and the twilight show, which is the last matinee of the day is $5.50. 

"The Crown Movie Theater, in Miami Lakes by the Super Walmart, is an excellent choice for students," said junior, Malory Gaillard.

The Shopping

The Aventura Mall and the Ball Harbour Shops are the two best places for fashionistas and trendy students come together for an afternoon of shopping bliss.

The Aventura Mall is a big draw around the area backing up traffic down Biscayne Boulevard every day of the week. Popular name brand name shops such as Bloomingdales, Armani and the Gap, as well as familiar eateries like the Cheesecake Factory, Cinnabon and the delicious Haagen Dazs can be found on three different floors. 

For those interested in more refined shopping then they should consider Bal Harbour. The mall is considered the number one most productive shopping center in the U.S., based on average sales per square inch, beating even the Mall of Americas, in Bloomington, Minnesota.

The mall is located 15 minutes south of BBC. Visitors can enjoy quality shopping and star gazing as well because stars like Paris Hilton, Oscar de la Renta and Jamie Foxx have been spotted near by. 

"They are pretty nice shops that are more expensive than the normal shopping areas, but I go there all the time," said senior Romaine Layne. 

The Dining

After a long day of shopping, hunger starts to set in, and where better to grab a bite than Timo or Moroccan Nights. Timo, located in the heart of Sunny Isles and 20 minutes away from BBC, is owned by FIU's School of Hospitality alumni, Chef Tim Andriola and Rodrigo Martinez. 

After receiving rave reviews in South Florida's Sun-Sentinel, this Italian restaurant has become a popular dinner spot. 

"It would be the type of place to go for a special evening. The menu features an appealing blend of Italian and Mediterranean textures and accents brought out in delectable food," said junior Max Jodette. 

If you're not financially equipped for fine dining, then head over to Moroccan Nights. 

Moroccan Nights is about 15 minutes away and located in Surfside, just around the corner from the Bal Harbour shopping district. This restaurant offers wonderful and authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. 

Under the direction of a new owner, the restaurant offers stellar service and entertainment on the weekends beginning on Thursday. A bellydance showcase has awed patrons on Thursday nights with a show that features up and coming student dancers, plus premier teachers from the South Florida area. On the menu, patrons can find Moroccan culinary delights such as coucous and merguez, Moroccan pastries and mint tea. 

"I have never seen Middle Eastern dancers, but I would go because it would be the first time to view another culture," said senior Yina Mendoza.

The Pool Halls

Near BBC, pool halls are  smoke-filled places where people can either master their pool sharking techniques or lose with dignity.  Two places to check out are Beach Billiards and Broadway Billiards. 

Both establishments are two miles away from campus, and if  you're game for a great Blue Long Island ice tea and a good time, don't forget to drop by.

Headline: SGC offers answers during fair
Author: Jackie Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Got Questions? If so, the Student Government Council found a way to solve them. The Got Questions Fair, sponsored by SGC, serves as an opportunity for students to meet with, interact with and question advisors from each department, SGC members and administrators. 

"I used to work for the College of Business as a peer advisor and I found out a lot of students came in and couldn't get appointments. Obviously, this made them mad, so the whole idea was to have a fair where advisors would come out and speak to the students without them having to make an appointment," said Lemar Linton, SGC vice president. 

It took several thousand discouraged students and one bright idea to initiate the Got Questions Fair, which was launched this summer on June 29 and 30. 

Linton and several other students from SGC took part in organizing the fair: Franchine Daley (director of special events), Evelin Suarez (director of student services), and Vanessa Robinson (director of public relations). 

"This is the first step in soliciting student services, academics and student government with the goal of unifying for the students. These major programs, that should be working together, are now joining to make the FIU experience more enjoyable," said Robinson.

The Got Questions Fair will also help students with undeclared majors explore different departments. In addition to permitting students to ask questions that may not require an actual appointment. 

"The fair is a wonderful idea for students to get their questions answered. As students become more aware of this event it will evolve into something great for both students and faculty," said Liza Alexander, assistant director of student services at the School of Journalism and Mass Communications.

Advisors will be there from almost every academic department in BBC, including the College of Business, the School of Journalism and Mass Communications and the  School of Hospitality Management. 

Other departments involved in this event include Campus Life, Office of Disability Services, Career Services and many more. 

During the fair, Panther Card expansion surveys will be passed out, which will enable students to redeem goodies from vendors like Jamba Juice, Coldstone Creamery and Great Wraps. 

Students found it refreshing to see an event like this take place.

"Summer B was my first time in BBC and I came across the fair, which made me feel at ease to know that there are people to answer questions your first day of school," said Elizabeth Fernandez, a senior majoring in public administration. "I think it's great that the school is involved enough to try to keep the students informed." 

Approximately 350 students participated in the summer fair, determined from a count of surveys completed by students and conducted by the Student Government Association. 

The summer Got Questions Fair was a success; however, the next fair will have some changes. 

There will know be two parts to the fair. 

"The first day of school students are running around asking questions they need answered immediately, especially if they're freshmen," said Evelin Suarez,  of student services. "This is why we decided to have only student services in the first Got Questions Fair; students are too busy getting settled to worry about advising."

 The first fair will be held the first two days of the Fall semester; August 29 and 30, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., in Academic I. 

This will allow students to ask basic questions about tuition, financial aid, parking decals and so on. 

SGA will also be there to help students find their classes and guide them to the necessary buildings. 

The second Got Questions Fair will be held two weeks into the school year, so that students may direct questions to their academic departments before the drop period. 

Additionally, the second fair will be held Sept. 19 and 20; in Academic 1, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Brenda Benitez and her friend laughed uncontrollably during their freshman orientation at FIU. One of the peer advisors noticed this and asked why they were laughing. Benitez said she answered honestly, "I laughed because I was nervous and was trying to push [the nervousness] out of my mind." 

Later that day, she and her friend were sitting in the Fresh Food Company cafeteria when Benitez's friend said to her, "We could sit here all day and no one would care." Benitez said that thought excited them both, but it made her miss some of the high school teachers with whom she'd been close to. 

Benitez's mixture of apprehension and excitement is not unique. Making the transition from high school to college can be a scary experience. 

Many freshmen have to cope with the fact that they have gone from a sheltered nest in high school to a fend-for-yourself atmosphere. 

"It's scary not having everything spelled out for you, but in a way, it's very liberating," said incoming freshman Tracy Shimabuco. 

Reinier Hernandez said he was "20 percent nervous and 80 percent excited" about starting FIU this fall. 

"The nervousness mainly came from the fact that the atmosphere of the classes will be so casual and not so strict. On most levels, that seems fantastic, but some part of me enjoyed the structure of high school," Hernandez said. 

This conflict is obvious enough for professors to notice. Patrick Russell said that students in his first-year experience classes  always seem tense and nervous on the first day of fall classes. 

"They're self-conscious," Russell said. "FIU is daunting. They feel like starting over is difficult." 

Russell said he knows what his students fear the most. Every semester, he asks his students to tell him in an essay what their biggest fear about starting FIU is.  

"No one keeps track of you, some find that really difficult," Russell said. "They fear failure and disappointing their parents. They feel the pressure of being first-generation college students." 

Dawn Addy, another first year experience professor also claims to understand why incoming freshmen are afraid of the start of their college careers.

"College seems so big and sometimes it can be an unfriendly place," Addy said. "They come in here and they don't know what their rights are." 

Shimabuco agreed, "What I fear most is not finding my niche." 

Benitez said she feared not liking FIU and her college experience. 

"I've heard that these are the golden years; nothing compared to high school. [But] I'm afraid I'll [still] have a bad experience,"  Benitez said. 

That is precisely what the first year experience classes are designed to remedy. 

Addy called the class a "safety net, where you can learn about the services FIU offers and possibly even make some friends." Addy said she likes to break the ice each semester with a name game, in which each student has to find an adjective that begins with their first initial and also describes who they are. She wants her students to know that FIU is "not such a big, unfriendly place".  

Benitez is interested in finding out how difficult her classes are. She is also excited about joining clubs. 

"There's so many things I want to try," she said. 

Although he is nervous, Hernandez is looking forward to facing the challenge that is college. 

"I know my experience will be very unique. I expect that as far as classes go, I'll be challenged for once, and I'm excited and worried at the same time about whether I'll sink or swim, but I think I can handle it," said Hernandez.

Headline: Changes in Panthersoft receives mixed reviews
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A year after PantherSoft's activation, FIU's online administrative system, it remains liked by some within the FIU community and loathed by others, with few noting any significant changes. 

"From the student perspective, things have become much easier, of course, because the transactions are completed online," said Yogi Misir, associate director of University Technology Services Customer Relations and Communications. 

"We have a lot of students from out-of-state, and they're able to register for classes, they're able to, in some schools, get advising online, and they're able to pay for the courses online." 

Misir also noted that online transactions helped reduce the amount of time it took for transactions to be processed. 

"A lot of these transactions were completed by signing the piece of paper and forwarding it from department to department. Now all of that red tape has been cleaned out because most of those transactions flow seamlessly through an online environment," Misir said. 

However, reactions from students who have been using PantherSoft since it was first introduced have been mixed. 

"For me personally, I'd say it's gotten a lot easier," said junior Jose Maldonado. 

"Sometimes it works well but other times, the system freezes and it takes forever to pick classes," said junior Mikel Urbistondo. "The old system would never freeze."

 Many students who find PantherSoft easy to use have not noticed any significant changes. 

"I'd say it's still the same," said senior Amett Pino. "I didn't have any problems when I first started using it, and I'm not having any problems now." 

Reactions from incoming students who are using PantherSoft for the first time are generally positive.   

"It's easy to use, everything is obvious, everything is easy to navigate," said freshman Melissa Montero. 

Faculty and staff attitudes toward PantherSoft range from mixed to negative. 

"I'm just learning my way around it, how to navigate the different functions," said Harry Gould, assistant professor of international relations. "I've heard lots of horror stories, but I haven't encountered any [problems] myself." 

Other faculty declined to comment on record and requested that they not be identified. 

"I find PantherSoft cumbersome, time-consuming," said Maezel Brown, office manager of the English Department. 

Brown's complaints included being disconnected from PantherSoft after 30 seconds of inactivity, an inability to save her progress and mandatory training that must be completed in order for staff to be permitted to use PantherSoft for specific tasks.   

"We can't even buy supplies right now because we haven't been trained properly. We also can't hire our student assistants because we haven't had our training," Brown said.   

PantherSoft manages the academic and business processes at the university, according to student administration application manager Jose Peres. Professors use it to access their class rosters and submit their grades.   

FIU began searching for an administrative system after a mandate from the state of Florida requiring its universities to discontinue using the older Legacy systems, which allowed very little online application. Previously, students needed to register for classes in person, enduring long lines and limited hours. PantherSoft was set up in stages beginning in July 2003, eventually becoming available for student use in July 2004. 

"As we're moving forward, each term, we're adding more functionality," Peres said. "We're automating more of the manual process." 

The introduction of PantherSoft was not without its hassles. 

"One of the biggest challenges we faced when we went into production last year was the transition from social security numbers to PantherID," said Misir. An awareness campaign was launched to educate students about the new process and how to locate their PantherIDs. Misir stated that 60 to 70 percent of complaints that PantherSoft's help desk receives are password related. 

Misir also said that returning students who had to make a transition to the new system had some problems, while new students were guided through PantherSoft during the second day of their orientation. 

As of March 2005, FIU has spent $35,655,000 on PantherSoft, approximately $12 million of which was spent on consultants. The hardware cost $4.8 million and the software itself cost $3.5 million, with an additional $3.5 million toward software maintenance and $800,000 toward hardware maintenance. The operational cost of PantherSoft to date is 3 million. The rest goes toward salaries and human resources.

Future plans for improvements and additions to PantherSoft include online transcript requests, e-checks and wait-listing for students trying to enroll in classes that have reached full capacity, a feature targeted for the Spring 2006 semester.

Headline: Health Care Center presses for future pharmacy
Author: Eileen Naranjo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If you are a regular at the University Park campus, you might find it convenient to stop by the school pharmacy and have your prescription filled while you are in class. 

However, students who spend most of their time at the Biscayne Bay campus do not have that same luxury.

 The BBC Health Care Center has wanted to expand their facility to accommodate a pharmacy for several years now. 

"It has been brought to Brian Haynes' attention, and it is on his to-do list," said Elvira Velez, associate director of the health center, referring to the assistant vice president of student affairs. 

Unfortunately, due to lack of funds, this wish has not yet become a reality.

In order to add a pharmacy to the health center, the school would need to construct an additional building or add a wing to the current location of the Wellness Center. A pharmacy technician (whose salary ranges between $70,000 and $85,000 a year) would also have to be hired. FIU would have to obtain a license and stock the pharmacy with medication. 

The total estimated costs are  between $800,000 and 1 million. 	The benefits, however, would be an added convenience and lower costs of medication for students, faculty and staff, accoding to Velez.

"One of the most important benefits of having a pharmacy at the health center is financial. With a pharmacy, we can buy in bulk and dispense medications at usually a much lower cost, saving our students, faculty and staff money and still make a small profit for the university,"    said Richard Sands, pharmacy manager of the UP campus pharmacy.

For the past 10 years, the health center has contracted a company that pre-packs and pre-labels the medications it uses, according to Sands. 

Therefore, the medications it has at hand are select and limited. 

"It is not cost-effective for us to buy [medications] that are not usually necessary or out of the ordinary," Velez said.

 Going to the UP pharmacy does have its advantages. 

"If the health center at BBC were to sell medication, it would be more costly and take at least a week to receive, as opposed to the UP Pharmacy that can receive it in as little time as a day," Sands said.

The number of students who fill their prescriptions at the UP Pharmacy ranges between 40 to 60 per day during the summer, according to Sands, and approximately 100 per day in the fall.

Without the pharmacy in place, it would be impossible to fill prescriptions in a timely and cost-effective manner.

 "The number of students who are treated at the BBC Health Center is about 6,000 to 7,000 per year," Velez said. 

Students agree that having a pharmacy at BBC would alleviate stress.

"If a pharmacy would be created at BBC, that number would almost triple because students would be able to kill two birds with one stone. I know a lot of students, myself including, who benefit from the UP Pharmacy and I think it would be a great advantage to us if we had a pharmacy at BBC," said Carolina Perriera, a BBC regular majoring in journalism.

As part of a solution, the UP Pharmacy will soon offer a service that will allow students, faculty and staff at BBC to order their prescriptions through the mail. 

"Patients can fax their prescription over to the UP pharmacy and we will be able to send the prescriptions to their homes for a small fee," Sands said. "With greater funds in the future, we plan to expand the BBC Health Clinic facility and provide a limited pharmacy operation there based on demand." 

The UP Pharmacy will also offer a delivery service on campus that will allow patients to use their own insurance to purchase medication, just as they would at Walgreens or CVS.

For additional information, you may call the BBC Health Care Center at (305) 919-5620, Monday through Thursday, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and Fridays, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. or you may also contact the UP Pharmacy at (305) 348-2401, Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

Headline: Freshman 15 Follies
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Gaining 15 pounds over the time-span of one year doesn't sound like a big deal, but when that same gain is a common factor found in most collegiate sophomores, it is a big deal. 

Entering FIU, I weighed a measly 125 pounds and was considered one of the skinniest people in every room I entered. Now that I am a sophomore, I weigh 155 pounds and can barely fit in any of the same pants I wore in high school. The Freshman 15 has become the Freshman 30 for me and I cannot be more upset about it. I don't consider myself fat - if anything, it's a good thing I don't look sickly anymore - it's just painful to admit that I gained 30 pounds in one year.

In high school, I was very into working out and taking care of my body. I would monitor my intake of food, do 200 sit-ups daily and run for about an hour every night. Taking care of myself was my top priority. I must admit though, my schedule was a lot less stressful and I did have time exercise. I didn't have a job so my main goals were finishing up school and feeling good about myself.

Now not only do I have a steady job, but I also have to deal with the stress that come along with being a full-time student with wind ensemble rehearsals three times a week. With a schedule like this I just don't have time to work out.

I eat whatever is available and by available I mean the 24-hour McDonalds right around the corner from campus. I do occasionally have my health fits where I look in the mirror and scream "God, I'm fat," and run to the gym, use the treadmill for two hours and do crunches until I can't feel my insides, but that can't possibly be healthy, can it?

In order to stay fit while in college, one must learn to manage their time, and that's something I desperately need help with. I thought a trainer at the gym might help, but my  paycheck won't suffice for that. I tried fasting - not eating today and having a piece of toast tomorrow - but God knows that will kill me eventually. 

If you find yourself in the same boat I, bless your soul. Know that you are not alone: Almost every person in your academic year is suffering with a similar problem.

"I remember my freshman year. It was divided between ordering pizza and Chinese on the daily and by driving to the gym on the way to class. I was unhealthy, but I've coped with it now that I'm older," said junior Frank Velez, majoring in accounting. "I've adapted to a healthier lifestyle by means of just re-adjusting my schedule in order to fit time for the gym."

If you don't think you can handle gaining a minimum of 15 pounds your first year, maybe a visit to the Wellness Center would do you good.

Senior Health Educator Maria Rosales is available to aid any students with health questions.

"I know we, as college students, live in a society where we like to go out and eat a lot. The Wellness Center offers a consultation where they can tell you different places to go out and eat that have a healthier menu, along with tips for a variety of healthier daily meals," Rosales said.

According to Rosales, the majority of college students suffer from high cholesterol, and they don't even know it. Sometimes really skinny people have a high percentage of fat, meaning, if you're skinny, you might still be unhealthy. 

A dietitian is also on hand at the Wellness Center that can give you a more detailed plan for a healthier lifestyle. If you're interested, a tri-fit consultation can also be administered where your actual fitness level is tested and you can be given tips on how to work out different areas of your body.

Now, don't let all this talk about weight gain get you down. There still are some students who take time to pay attention to what they're eating and still have time to exercise. 

"I was scared of the freshman 15 when I started at FIU, but it hasn't really affected me yet. I have gained a couple of pounds but I'm assuming it's muscle gain. I still go to the gym three times a week and refuse to eat any fatty foods," said sophomore Megan Inkman. "There's no such thing as a Sophomore 15 though, right?"

Headline: Provocative plot made bearable by good acting chops
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Because of my work and class schedule, I don't have enough time to devote the same amount of television viewing hours I used to hold back in high school. However, in order to relax and keep my sanity, I try my best every semester to find at least one show I can faithfully follow, tuning in for at least one hour while tuning out the rest of the world.

This semester, my show of choice will be F/X's critically acclaimed drama, "Nip/Tuck."

Through a relatively new show, "Nip/Tuck" has managed to deal with some of the most controversial topics of our times, including abortion, sex-change operations, homosexuality, drug addiction and euthanasia. Unlike other television programs that may approach these issues through 'special' episodes or by briefly alluding to them, this particular series tackles the controversy with graphic details throughout the entire season.

The show, which is now entering its third season, centers on the careers and personal lives of two Miami plastic surgeons, Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Troy Christian (Julian McMahon).

Though McNamara and Christian have been friends since college, eventually collaborating to establish a joint practice, their secret lusts and competitions continually rise to form problems that would lead any man to the nut-house in real life.

Last season alone, the series ended with the shattering revelation that McNamara's troubled son Matt (John Hensley) was actually Christian's child, a secret Matt's mother Julia (Joely Richardson) had herself only recently found out. 

Added to the drama was Matt's seduction by transsexual life coach Eva (Famke Janssen) and Christian's struggle to keep the child of a former girlfriend who had told him was his son, though he really wasn't.

The show's acclaimed success lies primarily in this constant provision of drama and surprises, allowing each new episode to have at least one twist that will affect the rest of the series. 

Though these situations can sometimes seem too much like an unrealistic form of soap opera, the actor's superb acting and emotional depth make the viewer forget the unlikely plots and focus instead on the character's reactions to those events.

This year, "Nip/Tuck" promises to bring in more drama than ever as the old friends quickly become enemies, Matt questions his sexuality and a serial killer who has so far lurked behind the scenes claims a shocking victim.

Since the series is shown on cable, it tends to handle content matter more graphically than other shows. Nudity and curse words are a common spectacle, but nothing compares to the vivid plastic surgery demonstrated in every episode (hence the name of the show).

With its catch phrase, 'Tell me what you don't like about yourself,' the show manages to paint a fascinating portrait of humanity through characters who can easily alter other's appearances but can do nothing to change the sins and evil of their own natures.

The season premier of "Nip/Tuck" will be Sept. 20 on F/X.

Headline: Actors' Playhouse ends season with a dramatic "Bang"
Author: Ashley Capo / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
As a waiter brings the audience complimentary champagne and cheese whiz on Triskets, the show invites the audience into a luxurious Park Avenue penthouse suite in New York City. This interactive show, brought to light by the Actors' Playhouse in downtown Coral Gables, has brought back the lovable, "The Big Bang," from its critically-acclaimed 2003 season.

"The Big Bang" is not really a show, but an audition to potential producers (the audience), of two playwrights who write a twelve-hour musical on the evolution of the world in hopes that the show will turn into the most historically expensive show in the history of theatre. Although the "show" is said to have over a hundred different costumes and have televisions come from the ceiling when the 60s era comes around, the whole show is compressed into an hour and a half preview, with all the characters played by two men. 

The hilarity of the show is outstanding. The two men, played by original cast members and Actors' Playhouse veterans, Gary Marachek and Ken Clement, take the audience on a world history thrill ride that they will never forget. Using pretty much everything they can find in the penthouse, the playwrights play all the roles of your favorite historical characters: Adam and Eve, Attila the Hun, Napoleon and Josephine, Columbus and Queen Isabella and so much more. The fun never stops as they surf through time on gorgeous couches that furnish the penthouse the men are supposed to be house-sitting.

The set is furnished in true high-class style - in a variety of burgundy and gold colors. The set also serves as the props for the different characters. Most wardrobe changes occurs on stage, as the audience gawks at the amazing transformation of a mere drape into a Roman toga, or a lampshade into an Egyptian headdress. With "Gary's" brother's partner accompanying on piano, the two poor playwrights sing songs to tell the stories of all sorts of historical figures, usually wearing nothing but a pillow as a hat, some boxers and socks as gloves.

Gary Marachek is a former Duke University drama professor and has starred in plays including "Jekyll and Hyde," "My Fair Lady" and "La Cage Aux Folles." He originated the role of Gary. Marachek's facial expressions and astronomical singing abilities are only matched by his counterpart and sidekick, Ken Clement. Clement was also written in mind for the role of Ken. A veteran of the Actors' Playhouse, he has been in such productions as "House," "Garden," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and he played Dr. Watson in "Sherlock's Last Case".

Gary and Ken play the stereotypical Timon and Pumba roles, which never really get old, and do it with completely out of this world energy and pizzazz. On stage, neither of the two ever stop for a second as they are constantly running around, pulling down curtains, making fruit into wreaths and even using yarn bundles as Oriental wigs.

This show was fantastic. Any show with middle-aged men playing Pocahontas and Minihaha, as well as teaching everyone a thing or two about the history of the world, is a great piece of entertainment. The Actors' Playhouse, located in the heart of Miracle Mile in Coral Gables, has a real treasure awaiting audiences behind their forties-style box office entry way. "The Big Bang" will be playing until Sept 4, every Wednesday-Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Be sure to check it out before you have to wait another two years for this triumph to return.

Headline: Test taking proves difficult in college
Author: Sergio Carmona / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Those who completed at least half of a semester in FIU have learned a few things in college that weren't previously learned in high school. In contrast, there's more of a responsibility that you must put forth in college than in high school.

"College is more stressful than high school," said sophomore Melissa Quincosa, a broadcast journalism major. " In high school you were pampered by your teachers and in college you're on your own."

If you've taken college classes before, you're aware of some of the more grueling assignments, or maybe even lack thereof, since there are several classes where the grade is comprised by nothing but tests, putting a lot of emphasis on the success of passing the test.

"Not everyone is good at taking test, Quincosa said. "In college, I do the same [I did] as in high school, where I study really hard the night before. However, now I use study guides to highlight the books, which I didn't always do."

Those good old days of relying solely on homework assignments, as was the case in certain classes in high school, are long gone. Several classes in college rely solely on tests instead, with no homework assignments to raise your grade, making it more difficult to pass.

But is the class really easier with extra assignments included to the mix? What about those rigorous 1,500 word term papers, amounting to a whopping seven pages? It's not the length of the assignments that make it so stressful, but the high expectations that professors place upon you. Those papers that you received A's for in high school, amount to a C in college. The group assignments are also tough due to the flexibility of a college schedule and the conflicts students have with work.

However, sometimes that flexibility, as opposed to the more structured one, helps ease the stress. 

"College helps because it evolves around your schedule," Quincosa said. "I have time for school and work."

That flexibility has allowed you to structure your own schedule, choosing what time of day of the week you want to attend. Sometimes, that power can be abused because if you have a paper due in the afternoon, since you don't have to stay up the night before, the opportunity is there to work on it the morning it's due, thus causing you to procrastinate and work in haste.

"As long as I concentrate, it doesn't matter," said Sandra Garcia, a graduate student in chemistry.

Some professors don't even take attendance, giving you the choice of skipping as many classes as you want and not get in trouble like back in grade school.

The most important advice to incoming freshman is: have a keen interest in your major, as it will stimulate your pursuit in learning.

"I've definitely learned more in college," said Garcia. "In high school you don't have goals, but in college you know what you want to do."

Even if you're undecided, still have those goals in mind. Although you have more freedom with the flexible schedule, don't abuse it. Attend every class you can, even if the professor doesn't take attendance or if the class is tedious, as you would be better prepared for exams and those grueling term papers.

Headline: Starting your college career off right
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Page Designer
&nbsp;
Starting school means different things to different students. For some, it's a continuation of a rigorous course load taken during the summer. For others, it's a chance to find out if the third time taking Finite Math really is a charm. (Hint: It helps to buy the book).

For those of us with experience, this is just another semester. We've learned to cope with procrastination, hangovers and part-time jobs, usually while dodging hurricanes and becoming jaded in the process. But there is a select group of students whose beautiful and slightly tragic innocence wavers in the sun like an unpicked flower. These students are freshmen. Fall term is the lawn mower.

To those who made FIU their first choice, congratulations! You've joined an elite group of young people committed to learning and excellence. For those who made FIU their last choice, don't worry; there are plenty of ways to enjoy serving your sentence without the discomfort of a partial lobotomy. 

Here are some tips to get the most out of your first semester of the real world.



Major Mania



Rule of thumb: If you can't pronounce the name of the building that houses your potential major, then you don't need to be thinking about it yet. Take classes that appeal to you. College is about expanding your mind, so don't be afraid to explore what FIU has to offer. Watch out for the underwater basket-weaving class, it's harder than you think.



No classes before noon



It's been said many times, "I went to school at 7:30 a.m. every day. Logically, a 9 a.m. class wouldn't kill me." Wrong! It will. Unless you are one of the few morning people that exist (college makes you nocturnal), it is highly recommended that you stick to midday or afternoon classes.

 

Meal plans are for suckers



The taste of the food in the cafeteria is unreliable at best. The repackaging of food is also slightly unnerving. Tuesday's grouper fillet will turn into Wednesday's grouper gumbo and Thursday's grouper surprise. Now, I don't know what the shelf life is for grouper, but I do know that college students have better things to think about.

 

Have you met by best friend, drop date?



Above all other important academic dates, the drop date is paramount. Dropping classes isn't really admirable or always the best choice, but if you see that after three weeks of notes all you have written is "anthropology: the study of ants," it's nice to have that date handy.

 

Looking for answers: a lesson in futility



Finding help and advice at FIU can be as difficult as ... finding help and advice at FIU. Take matters into your own hands. It's important to be on top of your education path. From course loads to classroom locations, it's important to be self-reliant. If you're lost, look at a map. 

If anything, you can always look to your peers for help. Most of them will be more than happy to reluctantly stop, sigh, roll their eyes and point in a vague direction that leaves you more confused than where you started. Hey, we're all here to help.

 

Extra, Extra!



Sometimes the Fall term can seem like a good time to jump into some extra curricular activities. Be careful about overloading yourself while you have lots of time on your hands. Before you know it, you'll have six classes, student government meetings, rush week, tap dancing lessons and ninja sparring matches to attend. 



Marks of Intelligence



The first semester of college may seem overwhelming, but in a blink of an eye, it will be your third year of school and you'll be a pro. Clearly, you have somewhat of a head on your shoulders. You are reading The Beacon, aren't you?

Headline: "Misery" brings down the house
Author: Ashley Capo / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
From horror to thrill, comedy to pure suspension from your seat, GableStage's performance of "Misery" will keep you yearning for a pillow to hide your face in, and a couple of tissues to dry the tears of laughter - only this laughter isn't necessarily because the show is funny.

The show, based on the acclaimed novel by notorious horror guru Stephen King and adapted to stage by the incomparable Simon Moore, is about a talented, well-known romance novelist named Paul Sheldon, who gets into a horrific accident while traveling through a snowstorm. 

He wakes up in agonizing pain from his injuries in a foreign bed in the house of a nurse named Alice Wilkes, who claims to be his number one fan. At first, all seems well in the Wilkes's home as she nurses him slowly back to health, but all changes when she discovers that her favorite writer has killed off her favorite character, Misery, in his last book. She then attempts to keep him prisoner until he writes a new book that brings Misery back to life. 

GableStage's reputation for impeccable technical work is not undone in this piece. The sets alone were gorgeous, full of expression and intimate detail. The use of space is extremely meticulous and intimate - as most of the shows are. 

The lights, sound and color schemes of the Wilkes cottage are phenomenal. The audience could almost smell the old wood keeping this house together in the middle of a farm in Colorado. Unfortunately, a show is not all about sets, lights and pretty designs on light fixtures.

The woman who plays Alice Wilkes, Lisa Morgan, is a veteran at GableStage, starring in a few shows such as Nancy in  Frozen (in which she won a "Best Actress" award in 2004 at the  Curtain Up Awards) and Nurse Plimpton in the psychological thriller "Mindgame". This performance shows nothing less than enormous talent and immense concentration on her part. 

If you want to see the show for Kathy Bates, who played Annie Wilkes in the film version, think again. Morgan stands on her own in this character differing considerably from Bates's rendition of the insane farmer in the film version of "Misery." 

Although Bates was a lot more reserved in her version and used subtlety as her character trait, Morgan's energy throughout the entire show is completely opposite of someone who doesn't think she is crazy. From the moment she steps on stage to the moment she takes her bow, Morgan is on top, giving her all, making Alice Wilkes her own.

Paul Sheldon, played by Stephen G. Anthony, is a different story. His grasp on the character steered away from James Caan's character in the film version, which is a major plus, but his acting style is questionable. Although talented, and extremely well trained, studying in New York and even making a Broadway debut as the bass player in "Hank Williams: Lost Highway," this man cannot hold up the show on his own. He is his best whenever he shares a scene with Morgan, which was, thankfully, a good chunk of the show. Left alone, it feels like he has a lot to work up to, and he tries his best to fill in this empty space, but goes overboard a couple of times in the piece. It is obvious that he is a comedic actor, for his expressions and accents are very well done and entertaining. Therefore, it'd be nice to see him in a comedic play next time.

The effects were very well done, considering it is a thriller. All in all, a very interesting piece that deserves an audience. GableStage's talented director Joseph Adler does not let his audience down as he grasps the viewers with his vision of this very intricate piece and keeps audiences begging to know what happens next. 

So if you have nothing else to do and the movies are beginning to bore you with hideous attempts at making another "The Ring" success, check out  Misery at the GableStage in Coral Gables next to the Biltmore Hotel. It is playing Aug 6 - Sept. 4 on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.. Call and ask for student ticket prices.

College life can be a little stressful at times. 

Between classes and studying, students can feel overwhelmed. 

Where can students go on campus to get a little break from their hectic schedules? 

"Gracie's Grill is the perfect college hangout," said Sherise James, a sophomore, on the popular Graham Center hangout. 

They have a large projection TV, perfect for catching your favorite sporting event while sipping on a drink from a wide variety of specials. It's a great atmosphere for a party or just socializing with some friends.

In between her classes at FIU, Pamela Echeverria, who's soon to graduate with a degree in advertising stops in to Java City and grabs a quick cup of joe to perk herself up for the rest of the day. For the healthy eaters out there, you can get your fix at Smoothie Time, also in GC. 

They carry a variety of things like salads, pita's, smoothies, and protein shakes. The prices are very reasonable and the service is great. To burn some calories and work up a sweat, try learning some of the hottest salsa dance techniques at Salsa Kings, whom hold classes in GC.
