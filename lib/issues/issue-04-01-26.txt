Headline: Bush stance on marriage unconstitutional
Author: Andy Diaz / Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
I've always hated weddings. They are in many ways sadder than funerals. Funerals have an unquestionable inevitability to them - at least in the case of older people, who do tend to die more often - reaffirming with inescapable frequency the ultimate truth of humanity: it all ends! But it's this constancy that lessens the tragedy of the departure to the big nowhere. 

Weddings are different though. All the parties present are willing participants - with the obvious exclusion of the 12-gauge nuptials. The cliché sight is intrinsically mournful: two doe-eyed youngsters in the prime of their lives, staring into each other eyes, maybe they even wrote their own vows, tears run down their flushed cheeks, in front of an audience who can't help but ponder how long it's going to last. They answer this question that will not be uttered simply: "Until death do us part," Thus bracketing the remnant of their lives with two tragedies: marriage and death.

I'm exaggerating. I know some people in happy marriages. I just don't see that kind of happiness translating into my own life.

I rarely express my opinion on the matter, certainly not in this gloomy a fashion, and never to those on the cusp of marriage. But recently, the Bush Administration took yet another step in letting the Southern Baptists dictate the social policy of the country, so I feel I must speak out.

The Bush Administration alliance with the domestic mullahs has been pretty transparent from the President-to-be's speech at the Bob Jones Madrasa back in 2000, but the escalation reached an unbearable level of retrograde unconstitutionality at the State of the Union address last Tuesday.

After an initiative unveiled last week to spend $1.5 billion to coach poor people on how to make their marriages less dysfunctional and more "traditional" was apparently not enough to appease Tom DeLay's base of good ol' homophobes for the unacceptable infraction by Massachusetts's Supreme Court that ruled the state had no right to ban same-sex marriages, the president made it clear he would seek a constitutional amendment to define marriage if "activist judges" didn't stop their meddling.

Let's overlook the more pragmatic counterarguments to Bush's stance, like the irrelevant minutia that these "activist judges" aren't some rag-tag team of liberals with the monomaniacal purpose of undermining the conservative fabric of our society, but the Supreme Court of the state of Massachusetts, and according to Article IV of the United States Constitution, the other states of the union are required to give "full faith" to, among other things, "judicial proceedings of every other State." 

We will also skip the detail that a divisive president like Bush could never succeed in getting the support of two thirds of the Congress and three fourths of the states needed for a Constitutional amendment. You've got to wonder sometimes if Bush is aware of this. 

Most sinister about Bush's argument is its foundation on majority rule and the incorrect presumption that this makes the desired ban just. The fact that a majority of Americans oppose gay marriage does not make it right to outlaw it. 

Even if there were only two Americans of the same sex wanting to marry, it would still be an infringement upon their rights to prohibit it, no matter how many people supported it.

Somewhere in his speech, the president commented on the subject of democracy in the Middle East with these words: "I believe that God has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom. And even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades, it will rise." Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. And in the case of those gays and lesbians who seek to marry, it is your tyranny that is crushing their desire for freedom. Thankfully, it is bigger than you and the uninformed bigotry you represent, and it will definitely rise again.

Headline: Editorial: Panthersoft system overdue, new ID numbers safer
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The upcoming PantherSoft system will offer many laudable advantages over the existing Legacy administrative system, but there are still question marks about how the system will be implemented over the next few years.

The previous Legacy system, which relied heavily on paper work, snail mail, and separate computer systems that often didn't work together, was very out of step with similar ones in other higher learning institutions. The results were the legendary administrative foul-ups that have driven students to exasperation for years, giving several departments in our school a perhaps undeserved reputation for incompetence. 

Yogi Misir, associate director of Marketing and Customer Relations of University Technology Services, describes the appearance of the new web-integrated system as a sort of "My Yahoo" page, which will provide an easy-to-use one-stop portal to all the services that FIU has to offer.

Currently, Admissions is already on the new system, but as parts of the older Legacy system are phased out, other departments will be available through PantherSoft: Financial Aid by Feb.16, Student Financials, and Student Records by June 2004. 

But the biggest change PantherSoft will introduce will be the replacement of Social Security numbers as students' primary for of identification on campus. The old Socials will be replaced by seven-digit, proprietary Panther ID numbers. This is also an overdue feature.

While some students might be annoyed by having to memorize another new number, many will benefit from increased protection from identity theft, a problem on college campuses where Socials can be found openly displayed on stacks of Blue Books and homework assignments, and grade postings on bulletin boards (though policies forbid the posting of Socials on bulletin boards, it happens often enough). 

The shift away from using Socials for ID will spare the university from the liability of having those numbers so easily available.

As the system is brought online, kinks will arise, but this is probably inevitable in any system that requires a near complete readjustment. 

In the long run, students stand to benefit greatly from the Panthersoft system, and short-term incoveniences will be more than balanced by a faster running, more efficient, and safer system.

Headline: Dissidents Biscet, Payá suffer injustices in Cuba
Author: Neri Martinez / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Oscar Elias Biscet and Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas: Two exemplary activists arising from a civic movement that seeks a democratic Cuba with respect for human rights, They both share a common framework of values grounded in Christianity, non-violent struggle, and the power of speaking truth to power. Dr. Biscet is serving a 25-year prison sentence in a dark underground cell far from his home and Oswaldo has had his home assaulted and death threats painted onto the walls and door of his house. 

 A partial history of their actions speak for themselves:

In 1999, Biscet led dozens of members of the opposition and thousands of Cubans on a 40-day prayer fast. Biscet organized teach-ins on non-violent resistance, civil disobedience, and the writings and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. He succeeded in creating activists by educating them in the philosophy and practices of nonviolent resistance and leading them to challenge the regime, all of which terrified Fidel Castro.

Biscet was arrested Nov. 3, 1999 for displaying three upside down flags, an international sign of distress, at a news conference just as 20 foreign leaders gathered in Havana for the Ibero-American summit. Fidel Castro had him arrested to prevent him from leading a demonstration that Biscet organized to mark the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to protest the death penalty in Cuba. 

Upon his release on Oct. 31, 2002, he organized another press conference to denounce prison conditions and demanded that the International Red Cross be allowed access to Cuba's prisons (a right that the Americans have allowed to Al Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo but that Castro's regime denies to all Cuban prisoners.)

In 1988, Payá, an opposition leader, founded the Christian Liberation Movement (Movimiento Cristiano Liberación, "MCL"), which would serve as a basis to enact the ground-breaking Varela Project. By 1990, State Security had detained, interrogated and threatened Payá with prison if he continued his defiance.

In 1995, Payá became one of five organizers of the Cuban Council (Concilio Cubano). In 1999, Payá drafted the manifesto titled "All Together" ("Todos Unidos"). In March of 2001, "Todos Unidos" summoned dozens of opposition groups to collect the 10,000 signatures necessary to make the Varela Project a Bill of Law.

Towards the end of 2002, Payá won the European Union's Sakharov Award, the highest honor in Europe given to a human rights activist. After state security trashed his house the very next day, and under pressure from Cuba's largest trading partner, the European Union, he was granted an exit visa by the regime to receive his award and return to Cuba in early 2003.

In response to the recognition of Paya's efforts on March 18, 2003 the regime engages in a nationwide crackdown of human rights activists, dissidents, and opposition leaders. Over 40 of the 75 are activists who have worked on Project Varela. In October of 2003, Payá and members of Todos Unidos delivered over 14,000 signatures supporting the Varela Project.

Payá has shed light on the hypocrisy of the Cuban government by using actions of socialist legality to expose the lawlessness of a regime that does not even respect its own rules. There is a great possibility that he could still be imprisoned or suffer an "accident" but because he is now a public figure, it would further expose the regime's hypocrisy.  Other dissidents who are not public figures suffer the uncertainty of prison sentences.  

Both Payá and Biscet have been influenced by Gandhi and even more so by the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Payá, in his address to the European Parliament upon receiving the Sahkarov Award declared, "The first victory we can claim is that our hearts are free of hatred. Hence we say to those who persecute us and who try to dominate us: 'You are my brother. I do not hate you, but you are not going to dominate me by fear. I do not wish to impose my truth, nor do I wish you to impose yours on me. We are going to seek the truth together'."  

As Martin Luther King said: 

"If a nation is capable of finding amongst its ranks of people 5 percent willing to go voluntarily to prison for a cause they consider just, then no obstacle will stand in their way." 

The Free Cuba Foundation celebrate the example set by Oscar Elias Biscet and Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas because we share their principles: speaking the truth in order to empower defenders of human rights in challenging an unjust system using non-violent means. We invite you on Jan. 28, 2004, GL 100B at 8 p.m. to join us in remembering the values of the great teachers of non-violence: Jose Martí, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.

Jeb Bush slights students with budget cuts, tuition

To the Editor: 

When is enough enough? Haven't the Bushes and their Republican cronies done enough to break down America? Obviously, Jeb Bush doesn't think so. Jeb is taking a direct shot at college students in Florida, in essence telling us our votes and opinions won't matter come big brother's big election day in November.

Bush has proposed 2004-2005 budget that will increase tuition at the state's 11 public universities by 7.5 percent, piled on top of last year's 8.5 percent increase. I won't dispute the fact that higher education badly needed increased funding, so state universities rightously were given a 5.7 percent funding increase from last year. However, why the need to extract the money from student's already empty pockets?

Why the need to slash taxes that the rich pay on stocks and bonds? Is there truly a need for a $48 million week-long sales tax break on school supplies and clothes? Essentially, Bush is telling Floridians that making sure his wealthy friends are well taken care of is a much higher priority than making a college education reasonably affordable to students. 

God willing, Americans will dump President Bush come November, unfortunetly, we're stuck with Jeb a few more years. That means we, the college students of Florida, must make our positions heard. Bush will continually throw our interests to the curb unless he and all Florida Republicans know that we will remember their actions come time for re-election. Jeb has a "my way is the right way" attitude. He insults Floridians by blaming them for mandating better transportation and smaller classrooms and insisting they repeal.

As President of the FIU College Democrats, I call on all politically active students to call, write, or e-mail their representatives and let them know where you stand. The Florida Legislature must approve the budget before it becomes official. We can make a difference. We can have a hand in whether or not we will pay that extra 7.5 percent come Fall 2004. Our voices do matter. Let's use them to make a difference right now.

Columnist should have cited his sources

To the Editor: 

In response to John Colagrande Jr's Jan. 12 [column], "A 2004 voter's guide to Bush resume," I really find it hard to believe that any journalist at The Beacon (as left-wing as they are) would stoop as low as to write up what was printed in last week's edition.

You say in the second paragraph, that it doesn't matter who we vote for as long as we vote. 

Then you immediately follow it with the Bush "resume."  First you say just vote, and then you try to sway votes away from Bush. Which is it going to be?

Based on your article there is no source of information for the "Bush resume," and as a staff writer for The Beacon you should have known this. You found this piece on an website and failed to acknowledge which website it was. I have seen this on several anti-Bush websites, but you make it unclear if you took this from a legit source. Why would you not credit your source for this? Did you want the readers to believe that this is the real Bush resume?  

Anything on the internet could've been written by anyone (in this case, the "resume" was made by a woman named Kelly Kramer, which you failed to mention). As a former Beacon writer, one of the things we were told when writing articles is to make sure that all of our information actually had a source and could be verified. Using the defense "but this is only [a column]" doesn't cut it with me, because you only wrote two small paragraphs for this article. The rest was the cutting and pasting of something Kramer wrote to put on her website as a joke and as a stab at the President. 

Your [column] looks like nothing more than an extra attempt to get your name in the newspaper and go after the President. Apparently you've done it so much, you've run out of ideas and are resulting in using other people's writings. 

If anyone is interested in a real George W. Bush background glimpse, there are detailed biographies on http://www.whitehouse.gov, www.whitehouse.gov, or http://www.biography.com, www.biography.com. And no, I did not write those.

Headline: Sun Belt blues continue for men's basketball

&nbsp;
Jan. 17 - Denver 78, FIU 44

The FIU men's basketball team's woes continued with an embarrassing 78-44 loss to Denver on the road on Jan. 17.

"Denver just came out and played with a whole lot more heart and passion than we did," said a disappointed Marsh after the game. "We gave up too many uncontested shots and tonight's effort was just embarrassing and disappointing."

Just 1:15 into the game, Carlos Morban hit a three pointer for FIU to tie the score at three. This was the closest the Golden Panthers would ever be in the game. FIU did not score another basket until 3:56 were left to play in the half, making the score 37-6. 

FIU missed 13 straight field goals and committed 16 turnovers in the first half alone. The Golden Panthers entered halftime down 48-11 after shooting a dreadful 4-for-20.

On the other hand, Denver made 17 of 32 attempts, shooting over 53 percent from the field. The Pioneers also shot an even more astonishing 57 percent beyond the three point arch.

But the second half proved to be a different story for FIU. The Pioneers were outscored 33-30 behind Warren Gale's season high nine points. FIU shot 43 percent in the second half and Denver managed to shoot only 33 percent.

Morban led all players with 16 points. Marcus Robinson added 10 for FIU, but had only three assists.

Denver stretched their bench throughout the game, using 12 players, with 10 scoring and only one playing less than 10 minutes. Brett Starkey scored a team-high 11 points for Denver, which snapped a two-game losing streak.It was the largest margin of victory for the Pioneers since returning to Division I in 1998. By scoring only 11 points in the first half, the Golden Panthers set a new school record for fewest points in a half.

After the loss, Marsh questioned his team's competitiveness.

"It got to a point where I thought we had a group out there that stopped fighting. I can't think of another time in my career here where we've had guys just stop fighting, stop competing," Marsh said.

FIU center Belco Bamba, who collected five rebounds in 21 minutes, agreed with his head coach on the team's lackluster effort.

"It was just a lack of effort and focus from the team. It was not one single person. The whole team didn't play well. We did not compete and we need to get people ready and focused," Bamba said.

FIU fell to 3-12 overall and 0-3 in the Sun Belt.

Jan. 19 - North Texas 55, FIU 48

After a 34-point loss to Denver, the Golden Panthers were still looking for their first Sun Belt Conference victory against the North Texas, but fell short with a 55-48 loss to the Mean Green in Denton, TX.

North Texas opened up the game with a 12-2 run, but FIU did not let the game get away. After a three-point play by forward Byron Burnett, FIU closed the gap to within three at 15-12.

Belco Bamba received extra playing time in the first half and scored seven first half points as FIU's starting lineup of Marcus Robinson, Raphael daSilva and Burnett fell into foul trouble. At halftime, North Texas led by five, 30-25. FIU came out in the second half and applied early pressure on the defensive side. The Golden Panthers pulled to within one, 40-39, but North Texas pulled away on some key free throws late in the game.

Harry Lum led FIU with his third 20-plus point game of the season by scoring 21 points on 8-of-15 shooting. Robinson and Morban, two of FIU's top scorers, struggled offensively. They combined to go only 1-for-13 from the field for only six points. 

Bamba played well defensively for FIU and surprised fans with his offensive outburst from the free throw line. 

He converted on 7-of-8 free throws, an area the Golden Panthers have struggled in all year.

"My team [depends] on me and asks me to be the defensive voice for the team. [The defense] is the focus and when I play defense, I achieve my goals," Bamba said. Any way I can help my team win basketball games, you gotta take it. I was aggressive by going eight times to the free throw line."

Jerome Rogers led the Mean Green with 16 points and Leonard Hopkins added 13.

Both teams combined for a total of only 11 assists and combined for 25 turnovers. FIU, which lost its sixth straight game, held North Texas to 34 percent shooting for the game, but was held to 29 percent shooting by the Mean Green.

Despite the loss, Marsh was happy with the play of Gale, Bamba and Gabriel Lazo, who all played more minutes due to foul trouble. After the 34-point blowout to Denver where Marsh questioned the play of his team, he showed approval for his team's effort against the Mean Green.

"I can't take anything away from our team because they competed tonight. We came out and stayed with the game plan and put ourselves in a position to try to get it, but we just couldn't pull it off," said Marsh, whose team fell to 0-4 in Sun Belt Conference play and 3-13 overall.

FIU has now lost 11 of its past 12 games and faces a major hurdle if it hopes to win the conference.

Jan. 17 - FIU 59, Denver 54

Coming off a heart-breaking two-point loss to Arkansas State, the FIU women's basketball team rebounded with a hard-fought 59-54 victory over Denver at the Golden Panther Arena on Jan. 17. 

FIU trailed from the start and didn't take the lead until senior Ivelina Vrancheva hit a three pointer from downtown with 10:32 to go in the first half, putting the Lady Golden Panthers up 15-14. FIU held on to that lead for the rest of the first half and entered the intermission with a 31-28 lead. 

Junior Milena Tomova was a monster on the boards, leading the way for FIU with seven rebounds and added 11 points in the first half. 

"Milena really helped us out rebounding on offense and defense," Vrancheva said.

But FIU cooled down when the second half got underway, as the Pioneers went on an 8-0 run to start the third quarter. 

The Lady Golden Panthers trailed 36-31 at that point and didn't regain the lead again until Vrancheva hit two free throws with 10:13 remaining in the game, giving FIU a 45-44 advantage. 

With four minutes remaining in the game Tasha Jones hit a jumper, giving the Pioneers a 49-48 lead, but FIU fought back and regained control with a rebound by Vrancheva and a layup by Tomova, giving FIU a 52-49 lead. 

From there, the Lady Panthers finished off the Pioneers with a 5-0 run. Senior Jello Moore hit two late free-throws to seal the game for FIU. 

Tomova ended the night with her third straight double-double with a game-high 18 points and 13 rebounds. 

Vrancheva finished the night with 13 points and a game-high eight assists. She is now ranked 13th in the nation in assists and leads the Sun Belt Conference. 

Freshman Eva Makela also chipped in for FIU, scoring 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting off the bench.

"Eva stepped up and was playing really good," Vrancheva said. "She helped us a lot."

Three Denver players finished in double-figures, led by Jones' 14 points, five assists and a game-high three steals.

FIU improved to 8-8 on the season and 2-1 in conference play with the win.

Jan. 19 - North Texas 55, FIU 53

FIU failed to win consecutive conference games and saw its three-game home winning streak snapped with a tough 55-53 loss to North Texas at the Golden Panther Arena on Jan. 19.

From the opening tip-off, senior point guard Ivelina Vrancheva struggled to get anything going offensively. 

North Texas' Erika Bobo's defense helped force Vrancheva into 10 turnovers in the game. However, despite Bobo's smothering defense, Vrancheva managed to shoot 3-of-4 from the free-throw line and dished out three assists during the first half. 

Junior Milena Tomova was spectacular for FIU in the first half, scoring six points on a perfect 3-of-3 from the field and blocked six shots. 

Two early three pointers by sophomore Allison Bustamante highlighted a 10-2 run, helping FIU to jump out to a 14-8 lead. 

A three-point play by junior Faeza Bouderra gave the Golden Panthers their largest lead of the night, 18-10. 

But the Mean Green answered back, going on an 11-4 run to close out the half and tied the game 27-27 entering halftime.

A layup by Tomova and a jumper by Asha Neal gave the Golden Panthers a 39-35 lead with 13:15 remaining, but things went downhill for FIU from there. 

The Mean Green went on a 9-0 run, capped by two three pointers from Kelsie Edwards, giving North Texas a 44-39 lead.

North Texas would not trail again, holding FIU scoreless for almost six of the final 10 minutes and forcing seven key turnovers.

However, the Lady Panthers still had a chance after Bustamante converted on two free throws with just over a minute remaining, cutting the North Texas lead to 55-51. 

A steal by Moore and a foul by Bobo gave FIU a chance to make a spectacular comeback with only 44 seconds left in the game. 

Deniz Boz hit both free throws to bring FIU within two points at 55-53. 

However, a turnover with seven seconds left by Vrancheva prevented the Golden Panthers from getting off a good shot as the team missed an opportunity to tie the game as time expired.

"They [North Texas] were putting pressure on everybody and no one was open," Vrancheva said. "It was hard for me to pass because they were pressuring me too."

Bobo had 10 points, three assists and four rebounds and Jill Medlock ended the night with 12 points and five steals for North Texas.

Tomova and Vrancheva each finished with 13 points and six rebounds to lead FIU. It was Vrancheva's 10 turnovers, including the one with seven seconds remaining that proved to be costly for FIU.

"We don't play as a team on offense and defense," Vrancheva said. "We have to focus."

Head coach Cindy Russo was very upset with her team, telling The Miami Herald after the game that her team was "embarrassing".

"She [Russo] was frustrated because we don't play together," Vrancheva said. "We weren't concentrating to win that game."

With the loss, the Lady Golden Panthers fell a game under .500 (8-9) and fell to 2-2 in Sun Belt Conference play.

&nbsp;
The FIU track and field team, led by senior Linda Louissaint, got off to a great start in its opening meet of the season at the Florida Intercollegiate Invitational in Gainesville, FL. 

Louissaint, who was named the Sun Belt Conference Performer of the Week for her efforts, finished in the top three of all three events she competed in. 

Her results were the best in the Sun Belt Conference in those events so far this season. Louissaint finished runner-up in the high jump (5-7.25) and triple jump (39-9.75), and place third in the long jump (18-11.75).

Also leading FIU was junior Kevin Timothee, who was one of two Golden Panthers to set a school record on the afternoon. 

His fourth place finish of 6.32 seconds in the 55-meter dash broke the previous record of 6.42 seconds by Brian Jones in 2001.

Senior Ranada Daniels set a new school record in the 55-meter hurdles with a fifth place finish of 8.28 seconds. Senior Marieva Bastien finished in 8.52 seconds, which was a personal best. Sophomore Yandiel Muniz finished second in the high jump with a height of 6-8, tying his own school record and personal-best mark. Head coach Steve Rubin and his Golden Panthers have a week off before returning to competition at the Gator Invitational on Jan. 31.

Dear editor:

2 things, please read the article in this link that talks about the price of college textbooks. It is so good, that you should publish it.

http://calpirg.org/CA.asp?id2=11987&id3=CA&

I think you should not issue two-editions per week due to the amount of paper that would be trown away and the stress your staff will incur due to working twice and finding enough information on campus.

On the other hand, I congratulate the Beacon for the task of letting other students know what's up in FIU.

Conducting MORE individual surveys to specific students (hispanics, freshman, etc) around campus would let the entire FIU community be aware of its ethnic and opinion diversity. My favorite parts of the paper are the surveys, front page, and sports.

I am the president of FIU Soccer Club and the Venezuelan Student Association.

sincerely,

According to Colleen Crouch, the marketing and events coordinator for the college of business, the foods, the entertainment and music were all intended to celebrate FIU's diversity. 

The Bizfest featured hula dancers, Polynesian fire eaters and Greek gladiator jousting. A 13'x9' map of the world allowed students to point out their country of origin while savoring international foods.

A climbing wall, appropriately named Mt. Fuji, was the focal point in the area behind the Ryder business building, where the festival was staged.
The event was sponsored by Joyce Elam, the executive dean for the College of Business.

There were approximately three hundred students in attendance, which according to Crouch categorizes the event as a success.

Headline: Comedy show highlights positive values
Author: By Sheaon Reid/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Each semester, the Biscayne Bay Student Programming Council holds a comedy show. This semester's show took place on Jan. 22 in the Wolfe University Center Ballroom. 

 Spring Laugh Bash featured Buzz Sutherland, a five-time Comedian-of-the-Year award recipient. Sutherland has also made appearances on HBO, MTV, Comedy Central and A&E.
 
Co-headlining were comedians Red Bone and  Dexter Angry, who have also appeared on BET Comic View.
 
 "I feel the comedy show was a definite success because of the turn out," said Zoila Rivera, Campus Life assistant. The ballroom was nearly full to capacity. Approximately 650 students turned out.
 
Pedro Sanon, a sophomore majoring in chemistry said, "I enjoyed the comedy show. It was fabulous. After attending last year's comedy show, I was hyped about seeing this year's."

Rivera not only measures the show's success based on the audience's turn out but also on the audience's reactions to white comedians. 

"The students are prone to seeing black performers, yet they responded nonetheless," said Rivera. "It was good to see that the students were able to experience something different and move away from the stereotype."

Though comedians practice their skill for many years, the task of stand up comedy is not an easy one, especially when performed in front of college students. 

Sutherland, who has been doing comedy for college students for approximately 10 years says, "There is a difference when doing stand up comedy for college students. It is a lot harder, because college students come with the mind set 'you better make me laugh' making them a harder crowd to please as oppose to people who come to clubs to have a good time."

Despite the difficulties, there are upsides to stand up comedy.

 "You will have everyone's attention and between the comedy you can slip in messages such as no drinking and driving, something I try to incorporate into my routines," said Sutherland.

Headline: Valuing Diversity Project to increase cultural awareness
Author: By Adriana Pereira/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In hopes of spreading cultural awareness and improving cross-cultural communication, the office of Multicultural Programs and Services and the Multicultural Awareness Club  are launching a Valuing Diversity Project at the University Park campus.  

Florida International University is known for its diversity.  Not only does its student population reflect this diversity but so does its location.

Positioned in the center of Miami and with students from all over the world, the university's first buildings were named in different languages to signify the school's uniqueness.  

Although the presence of this diversity is strongly felt in the classroom and around campus, some believe that students tend to stick together with those whom they share an ethnic or racial background with.

The purpose of the Valuing Diversity Project is to acknowledge and discuss cultural and racial issues. 

The project aims to understand the value of cultural diversity in our multicultural  community. In addition, the project's goal is to also stress the uniqueness of the individual apart from their ethnic origin.

 The project will consist of four monthly meetings bringing together a group of representatives from Florida International University's various cultural or social organizations. 

The two-hour session will consist of a facilitator; an icebreaker; two themed topics designed to focus on common diversity issues amongst racial and ethnic groups and a series of questions designed to engage dialogue amongst participants to better understand the individual. 

The first meetings are scheduled for Feb. 10 and 24 and March 9 and 30 from 12:30 to 2 p.m. in GC 305, students are invited to attend and in engage in sessions composed of common diversity topics and guest speakers.

Yasmine Abellard, a senior majoring in International Relations who transferred to FIU in the fall, took the idea from a forum she attended in West Palm Beach.  She then used  MPAS as her venue to get the project started on campus.

"I don't wish for everyone to hold hands and sing a song, but I want students to see that despite our differences we can still respect each other," says Abellard, who is a Haitian native.

Elena Cruz, coordinator of MPAS and advisor for several cultural specific groups on campus including , the Dominican American Students Organization , and Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority, is overseeing the project with Abellard and will serve as its facilitator.  
 
Both Abellard and Cruz are hoping to breakdown the stereotypes and provide a cross-cultural understanding for students.  The project will commence this semester.

Abellard, who has attended three different colleges and universities before her arrival at FIU, explains that she was looking forward to finding a cultural playground.  When she arrived, however, she did not find what she expected.

"There is no interaction among ethnic groups here," says Abellard.  "A lack of communication is what leads the way to generalization."

Danielle Dubetz, a resident of the University Park Towers, recalls that on Martin Luther King Day a commemoration took place at the residence hall.  "I looked in and saw about 40 people, but only a few were white," says Dubetz, originally from Virginia.  

This took her by surprise because although this historic event affected the Black community primarily, it is an event that shaped the history of this country.  

Back home, she was used to only seeing people of white or black decent, and it was not until she arrived at Miami that she was exposed to various ethnicities; however, she has noticed that people tend to socialize with people of similar backgrounds.  

"Instead of just saying that we're multicultural and we can live together, we should make an effort and use it to our advantage," says Dubetz.  	 
Cruz says that many students may be interested in certain cultures but do not know how to approach them.

Aarti Maharaj, President and founding member of Delta Phi Omega Sorority, a Southeast Asian group, and treasurer of the Indian Student Association says, "We have our own culture in my house."   

In her home, there is a blend of the Indian and Carribean cultures and the Hindu and Catholic religions. Her great, great grandparents were from India. Her parents are both from Trinidad but her dad is Hindu and her mom is Catholic.

"Personally, I like a melting pot," says Maharaj, a Trinidad native.  
The project will kick off with disunity as its first topic.  Abellard and Cruz are hoping to first target those students involved in cultural organizations and Greek organizations with a cultural emphasis, but they look forward to drawing all students.  

"It's always a good idea to get everybody together," says Shane Howard, a junior from the Biscayne Bay campus.  This is one of the goals the project hopes to accomplish.

Maharaj says that stereotyping is everywhere but if people would actually learn about other cultures many problems could be avoided.  "The more we learn about each other and our cultures the better," she says.   

 Targeting the challenges that exist among ethnically diverse students is another one of the project objectives.

Neil Reisner, an editor at the Daily Business Review and the Florida Lawyer and instructor at the university says, "It is important because there is very little chance we are all ever going to be the same and there is very little chance that we are all going to agree. It's critical, therefore, that we acknowledge that we are different."   

FIU is like no other college in the United States.  According to the FIU student database, about 53 percent of students are Hispanic and within that number the various flavors of Central and South America are immense. Black students make up about 14 percent of the population while Asians count for almost 4 percent and Indians for 2 percent.  
In comparison to all minority groups together, Anglos stay behind at only 21 percent of the student population.  

According to the project proposal, the Valuing Diversity Project hopes that its participants will recognize the importance of cross-cultural communication in helping to bridge cultural gaps. 

Cruz says, "We are setting the pace for what the rest of the U.S. will look like in the future in regards to universities."

Headline: Panther ID to replace Social Security number
Author: By Brenda Adrianzen/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As the change from the current administrative Legacy system to the new PantherSoft System nears, the main concern for students, staff, and the PantherSoft staff is the new Panther ID. 

The Panther IDs, which will replace the current use of the Social Security number, are set to be generated in February. The seven-digit ID numbers will be sent to all students through their FIU e-mail account. Yogi Misir, Associate Director of Marketing and Customer Relations for University Technology Services feels that this will be the biggest hurdle. "One of the biggest urgencies in Fall 2004 [is that] the Panther ID will be disseminated," Misir said. 

The goal of the $40 million PantherSoft system is to provide a one-stop entry for students to get all their information. Misir describes the system as a type of "My Yahoo" page, from where students can access everything they need. The system will communicate with students primarily through their FIU e-mail addresses. 

E-mails have already been sent to students notifying them that the IDs are on their way and advising them keep their FIU e-mail accounts current. Since not all students use their FIU e-mail accounts on a regular basis, the PantherSoft staff has already begun to organize a comprehensive Panther ID awareness kit. 

According to Misir part of the awareness effort includes making presentations to students, staff, residence hall advisers, and the Student Government Association, as well as printing flyers, in the hopes of quickly disseminating information about the system on both campuses.

"Hopefully, there will be no way students will miss [the advertising]," Misir said. 

According to Misir, approximately 30 percent of FIU students are not familiar with their e-mail account, so Misir and Nermarí Faría, Marketing Assistant, have come up with a creative marketing campaign.
The PantherSoft system will not completely replace the current Legacy system. Misir explained that the two systems will work parallel to each other.

 As each new phase becomes active in the PantherSoft system, the old Legacy system will gradually fall back. 

By the end of Summer 2004, all administrative systems will be available on the PantherSoft system.

The Panther IDs will be automatically generated by the system and will stay with the student even after graduation. 

 This means that if a student needs any kind of documentation after graduation, the Panther ID will be used to obtain the information. 
Although students will not be able to change the ID, they will be prompted to change the temporary password assigned to them for a new six-digit password, which must include at least one number. 
 Also, for security purposes, students will be asked to change their passwords every 90 days.

 "There is a huge responsibility on the students now to use the FIU e-mail account," Misir said. 

The system will be cued to send notices about financial aid, registration, and other university services. Snail mail will not completely disappear, but will be dramatically reduced. 

The system is also equipped with a self-service tool known as a "To Do List." This tool is a checklist for students. It reminds them of everything they have to take care of, be it registering or clearing holds. 

"This will be a cultural change for the university," Misir said. Many students are glad they will no longer have to use their Social Security numbers. 

"I think it's good, using your Social Security number is a concern. I don't know if the change is going to be a smooth one," Winsett Roye, a senior and MIS major, said. 

Misir and Faría are confident that all students will be able to use the system. It is user-friendly and students need no training. 

 Although students will have to use two separate IDs (Social Security number and Panther ID) for a period of three to four months, figuring out which one to use is easy. 

 For all services for the Fall 2004 semester and after students should use their Panther ID. Otherwise, students should use their Social Security number.

Admissions is already available on the new system. By Feb. 16, Financial Aid will be available and students will be able to apply for financial aid through PantherSoft. 

Finally, by June 2004, Student Financials (the Bursar's Office) and Student Records will become available. Students will then be able to pay for tuition and fees online with a credit card or an e-check.

Headline: International films return to MDC
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
One of the most respected cultural events of the year in Miami is back again for its 21st year. The 2004 Miami International Film Festival, with ten days of celluloid excellence, will begin on Jan. 30 and run through Feb 8. Besides offering a well-rounded batch of American films, the MIFF has been known for its choice selection of international films, screening the best in world cinema with works from countries all over Europe, Asia, South America, and more.

 Last Fall, FIU parted as lead sponsor for the festival due to budget cuts and other such circumstances. Fortunately, Miami Dade College, which manages several other similar cultural events much as the Miami International Book Fair, resumed responsibility of the festival and is promising an even better program than last year's. 

Nicole Guillemet, once co-director of the acclaimed Sundance Film Festival, was hired as festival director by FIU in 2003 and has returned again to run the festival for MDC. Guillemet, who's leadership restructured the festival to include competitions for Documentary and Dramatic Feature Films, has mapped out a festival that rivals previous years' festivals. Guillemet has also added a larger selection of films and documentaries and more screening venues. 

Over 60 films will be screened during the ten-day festival, beginning with the opening night film, "Bon Voyage," a French romantic comedy starring Gerard Depardieu and directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau ("Cyrano de Bergerac"). Additionally, a wide selection of Iberoamerican Films from Spain, Portugal, and Latin America has been scheduled for screening. Films such as "The Galíndez File," starring Harvey Keitel, from Spain and "Nicotina," starring Diego Luna, from Mexico.

"Iberoamerican cinema has a gift for storytelling, visual drama and artistic imagination that have kept it constantly at the forefront of world cinema," said Guillemet in a recent press release. "We are excited about this year's selection, which showcases the work of so many talented filmmakers."

Other highlights include the closing night screening of "Dogville" a new film from Denmark's Lars von Trier who directed 2000's "Dancer In The Dark" which starred singer Björk. "Dogville," which stars Nicole Kidman and James Caan, has already received praise in 2003 at festivals including the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in the Czech Republic. Von Trier was awarded Best Director for "Dogville" at the 2003 European Film Awards.

The screening venues this year include two new locations. In addition to the usual theaters at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts, Regal South Beach Cinemas, and Sunrise Cinemas International, the Cosford Cinema at the University of Miami and the Tower Theater in Little Havana have been added.

For more details, a schedule, and theater locations, visit www.miamifilmfestival.com. Tickets may be purchased at the website as well as calling 1-877-888-MIFF.

Headline: Hungry for nostalgia? '80s games released for today's players
Author: Ryan Huschka / Knight Ridder Newspaper
&nbsp;
The `80s were a simpler time: Gaming was free from virtual carjackings, bloody violence and fancy-schmancy analog joysticks.

And while the decade brought us big-hair bands, parachute pants, Cabbage Patch Kids and the Super Bowl Shuffle, it also birthed many of today's gaming stars.

Now, game publishers are opening up their vaults to let gamers who were born in the 1980s or -gasp!- the 1990s learn where their favorite video game characters came from.

Nintendo, one of the kings of 1980s gaming, recently launched a promotion giving away "The Legend of Zelda: The Collector's Edition," a disc containing the first two games in this acclaimed series that debuted on the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES, in 1987.

By registering purchased games on Nintendo's Web site (www.nintendo.com), subscribing to Nintendo Power magazine or by buying specially-marked GameCube bundles, you can experience 8-bit adventure-gaming heaven. Two strong Nintendo 64 "Zelda" entries - "The Ocarina of Time" and "Majora's Mask" - round out the disc.

Not enough nostalgia for you? Then you'll have to, like, totally check these games out, too:

The three classic NES "Ninja Gaiden" games are stealthily tucked away in the upcoming Xbox "Ninja Gaiden" title.

Mega Man lovers will get a chance to relive the little blue dude's exploits in the "Mega Man Anniversary Collection" for console systems and "Mega Man Mania" for Game Boy Advance.

Nearly every big-name `80s game company is pouring its two-decades-old coin-op and console winners into collections for modern-day gamers, such as "Midway Arcade Treasures" and "Intellivision Lives."

Three big-name cartoon/toy lines from the `80s have found new life on game consoles: "Robotech," "The Transformers" and "Masters of the Universe" will take a shot at video game glory. Can "Thundercats" and "G.I. Joe" be far behind?

The crazy bigwigs at Nintendo have thumbed their noses at gamers' desires to play over the Internet. Instead, they've pumped mucho effort into dreaming up creative ways to connect a Game Boy Advance with a GameCube.

Though I often curse them for spurning the online realm, I can't resist their latest crossover concoction, an ingenious spin on an all-time classic called "Pac-Man vs."

Here's how it works: It's a four-player battle. After your Game Boy is connected to the Cube (via a $7 cable), one player steps into the role of our yellow dot-gobbling star, and the other three play the part of the ghosts. Pac-Man tries to eat dots and the ghosts; ghosts try to eat Pac-Man. Nab Pac-Man, and it's your turn to be Pac-Man.

The catch here is that the Pac-Man player can see the whole board - courtesy of the Game Boy. 

The ghosts, playing on the TV screen, only see tiny sections of the map, making the hunt for Pac-Man much more tension-filled and entertaining.

What makes this one-trick wonder so fierce is that anyone who's ever played a "Pac-Man" game is already an expert at the controls, so there is no learning curve to picking up and competitively playing this party title.

Even better, the game is only $20 and comes with "Pac-Man World 2."

Headline: "The Butterfly Effect:" Kutcher responsible for film's failure
Author: Chris Hewitt / Knight Ridder Newspaper
&nbsp;
It's tough to swallow the premise of "The Butterfly Effect," in which a super-intelligent guy, played by Ashton Kutcher, finds a way to alter the past. Come on. Ashton Kutcher, intelligent?

Kutcher is one reason "Butterfly" fails. He's adept at light comedy but shows no aptitude for the more serious role of a disturbed man who keeps traveling into the past to change significant events and returns each time with new, more troubling facial hair. As if to erase our memory of "Dude, Where's My Car?" and "That `70s Show," Kutcher spends the whole movie with the same, serious facial expression and delivers his lines in an affectless monotone.

If Kutcher didn't try tackling new things, he might soon be asking, "Dude, where's my career?," so give him credit. Same goes for director/screenwriters J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress, but their efforts also come up short. Gruber and Bress, who wrote the excellent "Final Destination 2," want to say something about the lingering pain of childhood trauma, but they don't have any fresh insights into that pain. So, they pour on new forms of exploitive violence, as if making the movie more unpleasant is the same as making it more meaningful. Bashings with two-by-fours, dogs burned alive, kiddie porn - Gruber and Bress up the nastiness ante without connecting any of it to their central idea, and the result is a slasher flick that thinks it's art.

There is a kernel of a good idea here. Each time Kutcher goes back to alter his past, his tiny changes create a ripple effect that alters the lives of others. I like that "It's Not a Wonderful Life" notion, but Gruber and Bress don't do anything with it, and the script offers so many reversals of fortune for each character that they all feel random and meaningless. Why should we worry if Kutcher's girlfriend becomes a crack whore after one trip back in time, when we know he'll fix her life the next time out?

The result is a movie that says the exact opposite of what it thinks it's saying: Life's tragedies aren't important because everything can be fixed.

Headline: Fickle festival plagued with controversial past
Author: C. Joel Marino / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Beginning Jan. 30, the greatest movie stars will be coming to our front door!

Well, maybe not exactly. Though many might not consider it as prestigious an event as Sundance or Cannes, the Miami International Film Festival (now entering its twentieth year) has steadily made a name for itself among the world's elite, particularly for one strong reason: due to it being held in a city renowned as "The Gateway to the Americas" and "The Crossroads of the World", the festival now attracts the widest selection of foreign talent in the film industry.

First organized in 1984 by a group of local fine-art film exhibitors (now banded together under the Film Society of Miami), the week-long festivity was conceived in an effort to bring over-sea art to a public distrustful of anything beyond Hollywood. Though two other festivals had been attempted in the late 70's, the Film Society's endeavor proved to be the only enduring one, growing both in sponsorship and popularity - throughout the years, the festival saw the American debuts of such artists as Pedro Almodovar and Antonio Banderas, among others. This, however, would not be the biggest news in the festival's history.

In late 1999, FIU President Modesto Maidique publicly announced that the university would be taking full control of the annual exhibition, primarily to "focus a new spotlight on FIU and enhance a planned academic program in film studies." 

Along with an extended list of screened movies, the 2000 event (referred to as the 17th FIU Film Festival) saw the opening of the Bailey's Club festival, a Latin Jazz extravaganza inspired by Cuban born Nat Chediak, one of the cinema gala's founders and then events director. 

In two years, the film celebration grew tremendously, taking in more movies than it had done in previous seasons. This did not necessarily guarantee the success of the event. Chediak resigned his post in 2002 due to differences in management ideas. 

Internet journalist David Poland was hired in his stead, and though many innovations were introduced (such as expanding the site of the event from its original location at Downtown's Gusman Theater to parts of South Beach), the affair did not end well - many complaints were filed, attendance dived as prices soared, and Poland was promptly released; Nicole Guillemet, the successful former director of Sundance, was hired as his replacement.

FIU again made news when, much to the surprise of the media, its leaders declared in Aug. of last year that they would no longer be taking charge of the festival because of great pressure put on by "the economic slow-down." Instead, this year's responsibilities went to Miami Dade College as negotiated by the school's President, Eduardo Padron. Due to the hastiness of the agreements and still disputed economic problems, many thought that sponsors would not be found in time to carry out the ordeal. This was not the case - the event will go on as scheduled, supervised by Guillemet and carrying as much foreign flavor as past seasons.

And so, one hopes, will be the case next year and the year after that and all following years - for despite its controversy, Miami Film Festival's winding history has become as much a part of this city as the event itself.

                                               THE HARVEST OF SOULS

Let the peace of Christ rule in your heart. The day has come whereby we are now accepting and allowing the lives of unborn children to be abandoned and sold in the marketplace for the so-called good of mankind. It is with great regret and remorse as I reviewed the truth about the abortion issue, which is now an industry whereby, millions of unborn children are forgotten about and traded on the open market and millions of dollars are made on the exchange.
   The unpleasant truth is the industry is subsidized by the United States Government and backed by some of America's wealthiest men and family foundations. The funding is through donations which exceeded $200 million dollars last year from charitable foundations owned by certain billionaires and the American taxpayers who paid over $254 million dollars last year. One of the industry leaders recorded a gross income of $766.6 million dollars. The secondary income from this industry is from the medical equipment utilized for such procedures, which again is owned by the wealthiest in the world. It is very sad to say that for many years the industry has been selling these body parts to research laboratories, which receive United States taxpayer funding through research and development grants. The horrible body parts selling aspect is manipulated through the process via a contract between a transport company and the abortion clinic. The transport company then brokers the unborn children to private contractors who then sell them to Universities, pharmaceutical and Medical researchers. The marketplace for the unborn children is more accurately called transplant technology, invitrogen (vetro fertilization) and cloning. The unborn Childs body parts are priced from $75. - $1,000. Based upon a 1999 wholesale price list. It was recently discovered that the some aborted fetus has been born alive whereby the exchange has been made with living babies. The truth is, some have been killed after the abortion as well as some being sold deliberately for the soul purpose of experimenting and testing.
   The ongoing activities in the abortion clinic have established that 80% of women are underage minors and repeat sexual abuse victims. The employees are trained in coaching the women and giving them instructions on what to lie about not talk about in order to get through the abortion. The victim is in most cases an underage distressed minor who is exploited and it would seem there would be some child exploitation law that would govern this situation. The lying and forging of documents submitted for federal funding would seem to break some sort of Federal Racketeering law regarding organized crime activity. The underage victims and the men involved go unreported to the police departments as sexual crimes. The licensing activity of the body parts brokers and contractors may be breaking Federal laws when they cross over some state boundary lines.
   In addition, the present abortion clinics are operating with no federal regulations governing and no federal inspections being conducted. There are no requirements for an abortion clinic to employ nurses. The abortion clinics in America conduct the most active surgical medical operation and are the least regulated and receives the greatest amount of federal and private funding. It was the fear of the Lord that the midwives had thousands of years ago, who are those that fear the Lord today.
