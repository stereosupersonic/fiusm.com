Headline: Panel discusses improvements to campus safety: Phones expected in classrooms by next school year
Author: Catherine Kaiman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Ashley Clayton was driving to Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the morning of April 16, when she heard an announcement from a loudspeaker.

"Please go inside, lock your windows, lock your doors and stay away from the windows."

Having never heard anything like this before, Clayton thought perhaps there was a bad weather report. But when police cars started speeding past her she knew something was terribly wrong.

"It was like I was watching a story, but it was happening right down the street," said Clayton, a Virginia Tech alumna, who was on her way to the admissions office where she had been working for two years when Seung Hui Cho opened fire, wounding 17 and killing 32 students and faculty members. 

Now a graduate assistant at FlU's Career Services, Clayton shared her experience at the University dialogue on campus safety held at the Biscayne Bay Campus Nov. 1. 

"Having a strong, supportive community is priceless," Clayton said. "The [Virginia Tech] community really pulled through in crisis and showed me the importance of community and that we can all make a difference." t

The dialogue panel consisted of six individuals in the FIU community who brought different aspects to the discussion. Among these were Public Safety Police Chief Bill King and Philip Lazarus, a professor in the College of Education.

The panelists answered questions posed by Rosa Jones, vice president of Student Affairs and audience members. 

The idea to hold a dialogue was based on the findings of the Virginia Tech Report and the Florida Gubernatorial Safety Task Force. 

Both reports suggested universities and colleges should examine their emergency notification systems, staffing and training and psychological and counseling services.

Having been part of the Florida Gubernatorial Safety Task Force, King feels FIU's notification process is in good shape. 

"I feel that our emergency management group is prepared and we do have a siren system on both campuses," King said.  

Future enhancements for notification include telephones being placed in classrooms to report emergencies or be alerted of a problem on campus. 

"Through a recent initiative from [Information Technology], by the first of [2008], we hope to have 700 new phones implemented in classrooms throughout the University and there is a plan to have phones installed in all classrooms," King said. 

FIU uses InformaCast, a program that sends recorded  or live emergency messages through University phones and e-mails.

Student Government Association members have also suggested following the University of Florida's lead and using Mobile Campus, an interactive access program that sends students text messages in emergency situations.

Despite these ideas, there are no plans to install new emergency call boxes at University Park or BBC although King assured that SGA and Public Safety check the current ones every fall and spring.

"Call boxes are extremely costly to put in and maintain," King said. "Since there is a monthly charge through the service provider for each box and another charge if any of the boxes end up being damaged, then there is a fee to replace or repair the phone. My experience is that it is costly for the University." 

Lazarus believes awareness, communication and a timely response is what will keep FIU safe.

"In 8-out-of-10 instances of school violence, the perpetrator communicates intent of what they were going to do, but it never came to the attention of administrators,' Lazarus said. "Communicate as quickly as possible, share information and you can possibly prevent a lot of incidents."

Jones hoped that this forum raised an opportunity to raise questions about the many complex layers to campus safety.

"Part of our effort was to have multiple by-products of having a dialogue to let people know what to do and that [campus safety] is an ongoing process," said Jones. "I hope that we have a level of comfort, but also a level of discomfort, so we know to keep the process going."

Headline: F.I.U. WILD N OUT: Wildlife lives on campus, pays no housing fees
Author: Nicolle Garber / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
It's a sunny Wednesday morning and the Lakeview Hall ducks are feasting on a breakfast of soggy ice cream cones and pizza crusts.  A group of fuzzy yellow ducklings waddle after their mother and another white-feathered duck bathes in a newly formed puddle near the sidewalk.  

These ducks and other animals can be seen throughout the University Park campus having claimed their territory within FIU, but how many animals does the campus really host?

Philip Stoddard, a biological studies professor who specializes in animal research, is very familiar with the wildlife at FIU.

"We have roughly 130 native bird species on campus, about six species of turtle, two species of native frogs, lots of fish and insects and a few mammals - gray fox, raccoon, opossum," Stoddard said. "Native snakes and lizards have not fared so well. The native vegetation helps all wildlife.  The ponds need more of it."

In Lake North behind the Green Library and also in the "kissing pond" south of the Ryder Business building is where turtles reside. Arguably the greatest tourist attraction on FIU, curious students can be seen hovering over the bridge by the business building during the day, gazing at dozens of turtles sun bathe and float to the surface. 

Veronica Fernandez-Barquin, a freshman majoring in marine biology, finds the turtles "adorable."

"I'm actually trying to kidnap one to take home," she said. 

At first, the ripples in the murky pond reminded Fernandez-Barquin of Jaws, but soon she realized it was just the turtles swimming about in their quest for sustenance. 

"If you stick your hand out, they come over thinking you'll give them food," she said.

All natives to Florida, the most commonly seen turtles are the Peninsula Cooter, the Florida Red-Bellied Turtle, the Florida Chicken turtle and the Florida Soft Shell Turtle.  

The Cooter turtles frequently sunbathe in groups and have yellow lines across their faces with a dark carapace, most likely covered with algae. 

 The Red-Bellied turtles have a red coloration on their carapaces and a reddish orange center on their plastron (the bottom of their shell).  

The Soft Shell turtle is easily recognizable with its elongated, straw-like snout and very long neck. The Florida Chicken turtles have long necks and yellow striped legs and faces.  

 Some students have wondered why there appear to be dozens of turtles in the ponds. 

Every day after class, Lily Companioni passes by Lake North and is greeted by droves of turtles; Companioni, a sophomore, has a theory as to why there are so many.  

"I think some students who had pet turtles just didn't want them and decided that the lake would be a proper home," she said.

As for the birds, the most common species seen around campus are the Muscovy ducks.  Red skin around the eyes and bill distinguish them from other species. They have taken over the lakes near the Lakeview residence halls, most likely because students tend to feed them. This poses a problem as their numbers are growing rapidly -30 so far plus a fresh batch of ducklings- and they can produce approximately one-third a pound of manure a day.  

The Great Blue Heron, a familiar face in South Florida, can also be seen stalking through the campus ponds and lakes. Their varying blue feathers, elongated beaks and predator stealth make them a perfect creature to stalk fish and invertebrates.  

Fernandez-Barquin enjoys watching the Great Blue Heron as much she likes the turtles.

"If you come early in the morning, you get to see the Blue Heron feed for 10 minutes or so - it's quite graceful."

A less visible wildlife haven hidden within the campus is the South Florida Ecosystem Preserve, where 203 species frequent yearly. Located next to the FIU Panther Stadium, the preserve has been nursed by students and faculty for more than 30 years. 

Exotic and indigenous species share the preserve, and with its 45 species of butterflies recorded, the preserve rivals Butterfly World - but not the turtles of Lake North and the "kissing pond."

Headline: Club emphasizes nutrition, starts mentorship program
Author: Elsa Reinoso / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Students looking to further their knowledge of health can turn to the Student Dietetic Association, a branch of the American Dietetic Association that welcomes students majoring in all fields of study. 

According to SDA President Gisela Tovar, members are able to work in the community and teach others about nutrition. 

"We all have a passion for nutrition and we like to share that with others in the community," Tovar said.

According to Tovar, the SDA hosts and participates in health fairs at FIU, elementary schools and churches in the community and has won awards for their community service. The organization has also done a diabetes dinner as well as a diabetes walk to raise money for research about the disease. 

"We won the Outstanding Service Award by [FIU's Student Organizations Council] last year, making us the first non-community service based club [to receive] the award," Tovar said, "We have made [our department] very proud of us."

Deana Lawrence, SDA vice president, became a member of the organization because she is not from Miami and needed to get more connected to the students and faculty in the program, the community and her chosen profession.

According to Lawrence, SDA meetings are comforting because they are a way to unwind, learn from and relate with others facing the same issues -a change of pace from the hectic schedules of college life.

"I think that more people should slow down and take advantage of its physical, psychological and spiritual therapeutic effects," Lawrence said.

Tovar added that the association represents the future in health and that it is essential to teach others about learning how to make the proper food choices. She also said that SDA works with several schools with donation drives.

"Last year, we hosted [donation drives] of clothing and toiletries for Camillus House and this year we will be hosting a canned food drive for other local homeless shelters," Tovar said.

Federica Pierre, a transfer student from Miami-Dade College studying to become a dietician, said that she is looking forward to become a member.

"I am very excited that I will link with people that share [interests] with me," Pierre said.

Pierre said that one of her friends is already a member and seeing her participating in the club's events motivated her to attend the next meeting.

"My friend is always involved in all the activities," she said. "I want to participate in the elementary school program that SDA has."

SDA is currently starting a mentorship program with the Miami Dietetic Association, where students will be able to sign up and be partnered with a dietician from MDA as a mentor to learn more about the fields of dietetics and nutrition.

"I truly believe that healthy food can have a positive influence on bringing people together," Lawrence said.

Headline: Middle Eastern cuisine catches attention of students
Author: Rocio Blanco Garcia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Almazar, across the street from University Park's 16th street entrance, has brought a taste of Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine close to campus. The restaurant's bright colors are inviting: the chairs are made out of wood; the tables are red, orange and yellow and the walls have shelves filled with Middle Eastern canned products sold to the public but not used in the restaurant's cooking.  

Iyad Georges, of Syrian nationality and one of the owners of the restaurant, explaines how he has brought to the community a bit of his own culture.

 "We don't use canned food; everything is fresh and olive oil is present in all our dishes," Georges said.

The restaurant has been open for a year and has gained the recognition of The Miami Herald and The New Times for the best Baklava -  a rich Middle Eastern cake made of thin layers of flaky pastry filled with nuts and honey and considered the star of the Almazar menu. 

"We hope next year we will win the prize for the best food," Georges said. 

Aside from Baklava, Almazar's menu has fried kibbeh, a dish of minced meat with bulgur and spices with many variants, and falafels, a fried ball or patty made from spiced fava beans and chickpeas, served with tahini sauce.  The shawarma, a Middle Eastern sandwich usually composed of shaved lamb, goat or chicken, is also part of the menu.  

The restaurant, operated by two Syrian brothers, represents a break from the common fast food restaurants nearby ­- the ingredients are all natural.

 "This gem across FIU is great. The food is well prepared and tastes great," said Giancarlo Bianchi on the Miami New Times Best Of Web site.  

Georges said that the restaurant is not visited by a specific group of people but by people of all nationalities.

"People love it here - it's a clean place where they all feel comfortable and move the tables and chairs around to accommodate all their friends," Georges said.

Senior Angel Wong remembers the first time he visited Almazar.  

"I was looking for something different to eat; I had never tried Middle Eastern food," Wong said. "I walked in not being too sure of whether I would like the food or not.  Now I eat here at least once a week."  

The food isn't, however, the only thing that keeps customers coming back. The price of each entree is below $10. 

"This place is always neat and the food is always served really fast.  I must say the price isn't bad either," Wong said.  

The restaurant, open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday to Saturday, has become the favorite place for some students to review for exams while enjoying the taste of Greek and Middle Eastern food.

 "I come here all the time," said Claudia Sanchez, FIU student.  "I love all the dishes but my favorite is the beef kabbab. I always order the same thing. The first time I came alone and then I made my boyfriend come with me.  Now we come every week, even when we have to study."

Almazar is not a chain; it is the only restaurant the brothers own.  

Situated strategically in front of a multiethnic University and close to several fast food restaurants, Almazar has made students such as Wong, move away from the pre-cooked, frozen food that many low-price menu chains offer.

 "Sometimes I wish there was another one of [these restaurants] close to my house," Wong said. "I have sometimes traveled an hour from Homestead just to bring my girlfriend or my friends to taste their food. Maybe I should sometime bring my parents, too."

Headline: Review: Guitar Hero III:Legends of Rock (Game)
Author: Eddie Zeng / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Almost a year has passed since Guitar Hero II was released on the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox 360 version was released months later with some extras.  Now, it is time to strap on your five button plastic guitars once again with a fresh batch of new songs: Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock will have you strumming like there's no tomorrow. 

Guitar Hero III is a full blown sequel that features not only new songs, but new venues, a few new characters and a revamped interface.

There is a total of 71 songs in the game, which incorporate different styles of the Rock genre. However, Developer Neversoft has done a fantastic job in obtaining the master tracks for the game by featuring 51 original songs into the game; players can now play along to the original versions of Metalica's "One" or Guns N' Roses' "Welcome to the Jungle." Never again will you have to tear your ears out to terrible covers. 

What's changed in terms of game play mechanics is the Hammer-on and Pull-off system, which is essential to playing the game. It seems the timing on performing the technique has been loosened, making it even easier to perform. The interface has also been revamped to see the notes more clearly.

Multiplayer has been redone slightly with the additions of Battle Mode, Online Mode and Co-op Career Mode. Depending on the system, players can connect online against players from across the nation and post their high scores through the official Guitar Hero website.  Battle Mode is where two players compete in the same song and each player has to force the other player to lose by using a variety of powerups obtained while playing through a song; this mode will appear as you play through Career mode, battling against famous guitarists such as Slash and Tom Morello.

	With all the new songs and features, the difficulty has be taken to the next level. On harder settings, playing the songs can go from fun (Rolling Stones's "Paint It Black") to brutal (Dragonforce's "Through the Fire and Flames").

For those who can't decide on which version to buy -since the game is released on Playstation 2 & 3, Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360 and PC/Mac- players need not worry because all versions have the same songs. All console versions will come with new wireless guitars modeled after the Gibson Les Paul, while Playstation 2 owners will have the Kramer Pacer. Despite the new toys, you can always use your guitars from older versions of the game to rock, seeing as how Guitar Hero makes its debut for both Playstation 3 and the Wii with this game.

Ultimately, Neversoft's attempt in continuing the Guitar Hero series is actually a successful one. With all of the new songs and multiplayer modes, you can keep on playing for days until the next big music game hits the stores.

Headline: Review: The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass (Game)
Subheadline: Link's newest quest lacks visual appeal
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst News Director
&nbsp;
Every once in a while, legends are born in the world of video games. Earlier this month, The Legend of Zelda series gave birth to one of its greatest prodigies ever: The Phantom Hourglass.

Unlike many games available for the Nintendo DS, PH makes full use of every feature the game system has to offer, something no other DS game can boast about doing. 

Because of this, playing the game in public may not be such a good idea. 

There are several puzzles in the game that require you to shout loudly at the DS or blow onto the system for extended periods of time. 

Despite the embarrassment factor, the full use of the DS features is amazing. The uses of the DS are also much more innovative that ever before, including some points in the game where you must close the DS lid to continue the game.

Longtime fans of the series might find it difficult to adapt to the DS style of control. For the first time ever, all actions are conducted though the use of the DS stylus.

The normal, tight control players have had in previous games is gone. 

Thankfully, game designers made this new interface style easy to master so, after a few hours of playing, you will find controlling the main character much easier.

Once you do master the game controls, find a friend or log onto Nintendo's WIFI Internet and play against other players in one of the most addictive multiplayer games ever. 

The mini-game is essentially "capture the flag meets tag" with players alternating turns. If you're "it," you control monsters trying to tag your opponent who is trying to move enough gems to his or her field to gain points. Once you tag the opponent, its your turn to try and gain some points.  

Though addicting, the game was surprisingly a real letdown as far as graphics are concerned -a first for any Zelda game. 

PH is a direct sequel to The Wind Waker, a Zelda game released for the Nintendo Gamecube. The game tries to mimic the cell shading animation style of the Gamecube game but fails. 

The game itself does not look bad, but the Zelda games have been put at a higher standard than other Nintendo games. In this very rare case, PH did not meet the expectations set by its predecessors. 

Despite the letdown in visuals, the musical score for the game is riddled with references to past games and also manages to move the excellent, though slightly unoriginal "out to save the princess" storyline along. It's been the main plot of almost every Zelda game, but it's also become part of the series' charm. 

Overall, The Phantom Hourglass is a must for any Zelda fan. It would be nice to say it's the greatest of any of the Zelda handheld games but, due to dissappointing graphics, it simply can't own that title. Currently, though, it is the best DS game available.

Headline: Student Government: SGC-UP moves  forward with Athletics proposal
Subheadline: Partnership to cost students $90K in activities fees
Author: Nicole Acosta & Eddith Sevilla / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Although there has been no formal approval for a $90,000 Athletics partnership with Student Government Council at University Park, plans are still underway to proceed with it despite the SGC at the Biscayne Bay Campus' decision not to participate, according to Arthur "AJ" Meyer, SGC-UP vice president.

The Athletics partnership proposal will be paid off in $30,000 intervals over the next three years.

In a letter addressed to SGC-UP members Sept. 25, the SGC-BBC executive board said they did not want to participate in the purchase of an SGA skybox. 

Their reasoning for not wanting to participate in the first proposal included that only 120 students per year would benefit from its use compared to the more than 30,000 students who pay Activities and Services fees through their tuition. 

Other reasons were that students already pay Athletic fees and should not have to pay again to use the Athletics' facilities.

Meyer presented the second proposal, the Athletics partnership proposal, to SGC-UP during their council meeting Oct. 31.

SGC-BBC will not be involved in the second proposal, which will be voted on in two weeks, because they chose not to be a part of the first proposal and as a result, the new proposal will be an SGC-UP endeavor, Meyer said.

According to Katiana Saintable, SGC-BBC president, Cassandra Andrade, SGC-UP vice president, and Comptroller Jonathan Doozan, they still had not received a copy for the second proposal as of Nov. 2. 

Although in past years SGC-UP has asked to reevaluate SGA's structure, the idea was not brought up until after SGC-BBC submitted its letter declining to participate in the skybox's purchase.

"I'm thinking [it's possible] that they had this idea beforehand and maybe, with the skybox, they said 'Okay, maybe we need to get moving on [the reevaluation],' I don't know that there's a direct correlation, obviously, but it seems to make logical sense," said Jonathan Doozan, SGC-BBC comptroller.

Meyer said because SGC-BBC declined to be involved in the first proposal, it was not necessarily one of the reasons why they decided to reevaluate SGA.

"You can say that in a perfect world, in a perfect student government, yeah, it would be great to have every initiative that goes on at BBC and every initiative that goes on UP to be one University initiative and that may have some affect on the structure of the way we are right now. So yes, it may have an affect on the structure, but it was not one of the reasons why we are looking at the structure," Meyer said.

Meyer said a committee, headed by Kenny Gelok, SGC-UP chief of staff, is being formed and talks about reevaluation have begun.

Marbely Hernandez, SGC-UP president, said that an outside consultant who specializes in assessing SGA's nation-wide, would be contracted to assist in the process.

"This is not an attack on anyone. We're not saying anyone is doing a bad job. We think SGC-BBC is doing a great job," Hernandez said.

Meyer said he was the initiator of the skybox proposal, which he collaborated on with Jose Velasco, executive director of Athletic Association.

"From the original proposal, [SGC-BBC] didn't want to be a part of this and I asked them to share their opinion about what they would like to see out of it and, unfortunately, I did not get a response. I got an email stating the reasons why they didn't want to be a part of it. So this is an SGC-UP initiative so there are things that come out of separate councils and that's what I want people to know that we are not doing it only for us," Meyer said who proposed the initiative Sept. 13 during an executive board meeting.

According to the second proposal, the partnership would give SGA the opportunity to use the FIU Football Stadium, the baseball stadium, Pharmed Arena, the Donor's club and a skybox. SGC-UP's reasoning for the partnership includes the opportunity for students to network with athletic donors and sponsors, the opportunity to pay for the partnership contract at a lock-in price and to increase the prominency of FIU's SGA, according to Meyer.

"We want to incorporate the use of the skybox because we think it would be pretty cool to have a skybox and it really brings up the prestige of the student body," Meyer said. 

Meyer used to work in the marketing department for FIU Athletics, but he did not see his idea for an athletic partnership proposal as a conflict of interest.

"If I was currently working for Athletics, it may have been, and I wouldn't be proposing this because I do feel that would be a conflict of interest. It may be a conflict of too much love for different entities of the University's or the University in general," Meyer said. 

Velasco declined to comment.

Headline: Club breaks the gender barrier: Society of Women Engineers provides student support
Author: Luis Valdez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Engineering is a profession dominated by the male half of the population, but the Society of Women Engineers, a national organization with over 16,000 members, is setting out to change that statistic.

"Since the beginning of time, men have always been seen as the strongest and the smartest while women were viewed as being very fragile," said Marilen Costarelli president of FIU's chapter of SWE. "To be doing [a job held mostly by men], which only a short time ago women started studying engineering, is still something difficult to overcome. Ninety percent [of engineers] are men while only 10 percent are female." 

The club offers various opportunities and benefits for its members, such as help with developing r&eacute;sum&eacute;'s and posting them on the clubs database for prospective employers.

"I have a much better chance to get a job," said Erin Silva. "This society helps you on your path by giving you all the things you need to get ahead and to become a leader."

Members will also enjoy networking opportunities with people from some of the top engineering firms. Numerous internships and scholarships of up to $100,000 are also available to members.

Despite the club's name, it is not gender biased and is open to female students as well as male students such as Dronix Suarez. 

"I joined because my sister was the former FIU SWE president and my mom is a civil engineer." Suarez said. "I have great respect for women. The SWE were very open to the idea of me joining and I enjoy almost all the same benefits as the other members." 

SWE experienced several months of inactivity due to most of its officers graduating. But Costarelli and Brenda Solis, SWE vice president, decided to start the club up again so that female engineers could continue to receive the support they needed.  "As a woman, I feel like I have to prove myself in the field of engineering," Solis said. "I feel that this organization is giving me the leadership skills and the motivation as far as opening doors for me as a woman to continue to pursue my goals." 

During the last weekend of October, Costarelli and Solis attended the annual national women engineering convention in Nashville, Tenn. 

The convention specialized in workshops on developing skills, grants, resources, leadership and education in the field of engineering with emphasis on outreach to female high school and college level students and teaching them to be leaders. 

The event was sponsored by various organizations such as the United States Army Corp of Engineers, a federal agency made primarily of civilians and some military personal whose mission is to provide public service in the field of engineering.

During the convention's career fair, professionals helped attendees develop their r&eacute;sum&eacute;'s as well as provide spot interviews with various employers. 

"Many of the high school graduates don't know what the field requires and they think that you have to be excellent in math and science and that's not really true," Solis said. "You can hate math and science but love your work."

The SWE does not have a strict set of requirements in order to join other than filling out an application and having a strong interest in becoming an engineer. Meetings are held monthly with times and location to be announced.

Headline: Tri-Sigma chapter celebrates 16 years at University
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU chapter of the Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority will be celebrating its 16th anniversary Nov. 8 the University Park campus. The event will also serve as a fundraiser for the Robbie Page Memorial.

"What better way to celebrate our anniversary than by doing something with our philanthropy?" said vice president Sheska Ocasio.

In 1954, the Robbie Page Memorial was adopted by the fourth national president of Sigma Sigma Sigma, Mary Hastings Holloway Page. Motivated to aid the research projects for polio, she established the memorial after the death of her son Robbie who died from the disease. After the discovery of the Salk vaccine, which helps prevent children from getting polio, the philanthropy now focuses on recreational therapy for children.

Ocasio believes that helping children through recreational therapy is one of the best ways to do it. 

"Laughter is the best medicine because medicine always has a side effect and laughter only makes you and others happy," Ocasio said.  

The charity event will be a backwards beauty pageant where men will be given the opportunity to cross dress as women, or as famous Tri-Sigma members of the past, and show their skill on the catwalk.

According to Ocasio, the idea came from their advisor who shared this concept with the chapter officers since she knew about another Tri-Sigma chapter that has successfully done the event before.

Members of the sorority have been tabling in the Graham Center since Oct. 29, recruiting male students to participate in the event. They will be tabling until Nov. 9, selling tickets to the event for $5.

The pageant will consist of male students in an attempt of portraying their female counterparts while demonstrating enthusiasm toward RPM. 

The event will start with a brief introduction of the contestants following a catwalk, costume, talent portion and a girl-talk interview. 

The highlight of the event will be the contestants dressing up in their costume.

"From Care Bears to Carrie Underwood who is a Tri-Sigma sister are some of the ideas contestants can consider," said Shiham Colegial president of Sigma Sigma Sigma. 

Sorority sister Celinda Miranda, said that the Care Bears were co-created by Linda Denham, another Tri-Sigma sister, who worked for a toy company thus making it a good choice to use for a costume. 

 American Airlines is sponsoring the event, providing the organization with one roundtrip ticket to anywhere in the United States or the Caribbean to the winner of the pageant.

"[They hope the winner is] someone who is creative, just having fun and [who] can represent our organization," Ocasio said.

Andrea Malave, philanthropy chair of Sigma Sigma Sigma is the overall director for the Sigma Backwards Pageant.

 "We hope to raise at least $2,000 for our philanthropy and we plan on receiving coloring books as well as donations to take to North Carolina for our Alternative Break Site trip happening in the Spring of 2008," Colegial said.

Colegial said that the importance of raising money for the philanthropy is for the sisters to go to North Carolina to volunteer at the Chapel Hill Hospital where they will be working in the play therapy room with the children. 

The event will take place this Thursday at 7 p.m. in the middle ballroom of the GC Ballrooms. Tickets are on sale for $5 for early entrance and $7 at the door.

For more information, e-mail andrea.malave@fiu.edu. Proceeds will go to the Robbie Page Memorial philanthropy.

Headline: Student receives honorary degree
Author: Maria Chercoles / News Director
&nbsp;
FIU graduate Kristina Marie Panagos died in her Prembroke Pines home Oct. 25 after struggling with a brain tumor since the age of 10. 

Panagos, 23, had completed her fourth year at FIU in 2005, when she had to leave due to her condition, but was missing credits and did not meet the requirements for an honorary degree.

"I was told she could only get it if she passed away. That was not going to make a difference to her or to me," said her mother, Lourdes Panagos.

However, Panagos was determined to receive her degree before dying.

Following petitions from two faculty members, the Board of Trustees and the Faculty Senate finally voted to change the criterion for honorary degrees to allow terminally-ill students like Panagos receive a diploma.

A graduation ceremony was held Aug. 18, where Panagos received a Bachelor's of Science diploma in biology. 

"It meant a lot to her, now she is leaving a legacy at FIU because other students like her will be able to receive a degree," Lourdes Panagos said. 

Panagos' brain tumor was first diagnosed when she was 10, but her symptoms ameliorated after an operation and did not return until 2005.

Pamela Ledward, one of Panagos' best friends, was taking Physics II with her at that time, the last class Panagos took at FIU.

"I remember she left the last exam thinking she didn't do well, not because she didn't study but because she couldn't hold her pen right," Ledward said. "I told her she had to go to the doctor and get checked but she didn't want to, she wanted to finish her degree."

After leaving FIU, her family tried different treatments and traveled to New York last summer after hearing that Panagos' condition could be treated there. 

However, doctors in New York determined her tumor was too advanced. 

Upon returning, she was told she would only live six more weeks; she lived three more months. 

"She was a trooper, she was never the person who would say 'why me,'" said her sister, Danielle Panagos, 22. 

Despite her condition, Panagos got to live her dream last December: to visit Australia.

"I asked: 'if you could go anywhere in the world, where do you go?' So I cashed in my retirement and said: 'I'm going to give her her dream,"' Lourdes Panagos said. 

Panagos traveled with her sister and mother to Australia and visited the Great Barrier Reef, Blue Mountains and Steve Irwin's zoo.

"She was very passionate about animals," Lourdes Panagos said. "She didn't like going to pet shops because she felt it was her obligation to bring them home."

Besides animals, Panagos was also a fan of the Marlins, and would go to their games with her friend Patty Tapanes.

When her condition confined her to her home, her friends used to visit her to watch movies together.

"She knew she was going to die but she really just wanted to enjoy life, even though she was the one with the condition she made sure everyone around her was comfortable," Ledward said.

Panagos was cremated and her ashes will remain with the Panagos family. 

Besides her sister and mother, Panagos is survived by her older brother Thomas, 25, her father Thomas Panagos and a grandmother.

Headline: BUFFET TO GO: Cost for take-out food too much for too little
Author: Veronica Trueba / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
At The Fresh Food Company there are two set food prices: $6.49 for breakfast and $8 for lunch and dinner; including takeout. While these prices are reasonable considering the quality of food and the unlimited supply of the buffet, they are overrated when it comes to choosing takeout, an option excluded from the 'all-you-can-eat' catchphrase. 

Aramark, the company in charge of Panther Dining Services, has been working with FIU since 1995, and in 2005 renewed its partnership with a 10 year contract. 

Despite the number of years Aramark has been working with FIU and the approximately 2,300 daily costumers it gets, Aramark Resident District Manager Jonathan Garcia, believes Aramark does not profit at FIU. 

"Aramark doesn't make a penny, it actually loses money in FIU." 

The reason for this is that established commissions for FIU are actually greater than the overall revenue. 

According to Garcia the contract Aramark has with FIU consists of a compromise that FIU is going to make a certain amount of money at all times. 

Therefore, no matter what the final profit is, Aramark is obliged to give the University an already established income. 

 This means that if revenues are not high enough, "all money goes to FIU,"  Garcia said.

Aramark's losses were clearly delineated in one of the Financial Stability charts of Panther Dining provided by Garcia. 

The chart displays the amount of money lost on a yearly basis by the company. Since the year 2002 to present, the total amount of money Aramark has lost sums up to approximately $2.98 million.  

It is surprising how even after Aramark has spent great amounts of money without getting any direct gain, the company still plans to work with FIU far into the future. 

The hope of investors is that as time goes by, they'll get closer to a break-even point and then to the production of significant earnings. 

But even if Aramark gets nothing, some students feel that food in The Fresh Food Company is still relatively expensive. 

"I live at the apartments now and I haven't gone once to The Fresh Food Company because I cannot afford to pay $8 for lunch," said sophomore Tania Santiago. "That's $40 per week. [That's] a lot for an international student."

Then again, not all students feel this way. Freshman Kevin Garcia is a regular customer of The Fresh Food Company and does feel that he's getting his money worth when eating at this place. 

"I eat at the buffet every Thursday with my friends and for the amount of food you can eat, and the variety they provide, the price is reasonable," Garcia said.

The real drama starts, however, when it comes to takeout. 

When you order this service at The Fresh Food Company you can get as much food as you can fit into a medium size takeout container and a choice of a drink.  

This sounds fair considering that you're able to get a good portion of food and an overall decent lunch. But the problem is that you're paying the price of a buffet and since you're not there to take full advantage of the variety of food and or refills, then the extra money you're paying goes completely to waste. 

Some students interviewed actually said that if the price for takeout was to be lower, like $5 to $6 for lunch, they would consider ordering takeout on a regular basis, as opposed to buying at cheaper and more affordable places. 

When asked about the idea that some students believed the price for takeout should be lower, Jonathan Garcia replied, "It's absurd." 

He disagrees and argues that the takeout service allows you to get a respectable portion of a main course plus a drink and perhaps a choice of fruit, which in his mind, sums up perfectly to a $7 to $8 worth of lunch.

Some students seem to think otherwise. 

"I do think it is unfair that people who can't stay and refill their plates have to pay the same prices," said sophomore Laura Flores. 

The fact that the buffet is priced the way it is is backed up by the fact that people can serve themselves as many times as they wish but if they aren't able to do that [with takeout], then there should definitely be a more reasonable price."

Headline: Editorial: SGC-UP proposal a costly abuse of power
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
- This is the first of a two-part series of editorials on the proposed partnership between SGC-UP and Athletics. Part two will run on Nov. 8. -



The Student Government Council at University Park wants to move on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky - and they want students to pay for it. 

In mid-September, SGC-UP proposed renting a skybox in the new football stadium for $120,000; a sum to be paid over the course of four years. 

Shortly after it was proposed, the SGC at the Biscayne Bay Campus balked - and rightfully so. As SGC- BBC council stated in a statement released Sept. 25, "At a time when budget cuts are taking place across the entire state, it does not seem wise to prioritize an expensive purchase like the skybox when other expenditures have a greater need and [would] serve the students' interests in a greater capacity."

It appears that the skybox has the potential of becoming mostly a perk for Student Government Association members instead of, "a service to FIU students." 

After the initial proposal was rejected due to the staunch opposition of SGC-BBC, SGC-UP revived the proposal, this time with a lower price tag of $90,000 paid over three years. The new proposal is careful to highlight exactly how students will benefit but still fails to make the case for such an expenditure being in the best interest of students as a whole.

SGC-UP insists that the 'new' proposal will in fact help students as it not only includes the use of a skybox but also includes three yearly uses of facilities like the University Park Stadium, FIU Football Stadium and the Pharmed Arena for student events. 

According to SGC-UP's logic, this clause alone would benefit 78,000 students as it is the total capacity of all of these facilities multiplied by the number of times they are used. For example: the Pharmed Arena seats 5,000 people. Since we, the students, would have the 'privilege' of using our own arena three times a year for events, 15,000 students would supposedly benefit from this proposal. 

This is an example of 'creative accounting' at its worst. Just because a venue has the capacity to hold thousands of students it does not mean thousands will actually attend. In fact, to say that 78,000 students would benefit is laughable. That's more than twice as many people as there are actually attending this University.  

And as the SGC-BBC astutely pointed out, students are already paying for the construction of a football stadium - and athletics in general. The athletic fee was already raised last year to support construction of the new stadium.  SGA is funded by the Activities and Services fee, which is a fee students pay in addition to the Athletic fee. 

Why should students have to pay again to use these facilities? How much more money does Athletics need?

Moreover, it appears that the use of the skybox will be restricted primarily to members of SGA. 

According to their own proposal, the number one reason they are pushing for this 'partnership' with Athletics is that it will put them "at the forefront of other university SGAs." 

They go on to say that it would "increase the prestige of the FIU SGA." What the SGC-UP executive board fails to realize is that the way to put themselves at the forefront of university SGAs is to do a good job serving the students - all of them, not just those they can fit in a box.

Headline: Commentary: Season in review
Subheadline: Two-game series a microcosm of team's entire losing season
Author: Ryan Abber / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As the women' soccer season closes, it is natural and necessary to take stock of this season and realize what has been learned.

More importantly, what needs to be worked on and perfected for the next go around in September.

Instead of undergoing the time-consuming and tedious task of analyzing each and every game (all 19 of them), one can realize the highs and lows of this season based on the performances of this past two-game series (Not to be lazy or anything. Believe me it's worth it).

The first game of the series against Arkansas State was a meeting of the two statistically worst teams in the Sun Belt Conference. Both teams averaged a combined 1.84 goals a game, 1.57 assists, and were a combined 1-16-3. 

Neither team has won since Sept. 23 which was the 2-1 victory against Stetson University for the Golden Panthers and a 3-2 win over Central Arkansas University for the Indians. 

Factoring in all of these elements and some precipitation, this game really wasn't supposed to be exciting at all.

I am sure that many felt the same way (the game had the third-lowest home game attendance this season). 

Once the game started though, all the fans in attendance were pleasantly forced to get rid of their prior judgments because while they were imagining 90 minutes of futility, the reality was setting in that there was a very competitive game going on in front of them. 

Looking back I can see why this game was the thriller that it was. 

While I was looking at the averages for both teams I didn't pay attention to the fact that FIU opponents average two goals a game, and Arkansas State University opponents average three goals a game. 

Knowing this, it wasn't surprising that the final score was 3-2 in favor of FIU.

Though the game played out exactly on paper, it had nothing to do with the good passing and the three goals scored by FIU. 

That was a total team effort capped off with two great finishing plays by freshman forward Claudia Cardenas and one from fellow freshman Cassandra Sorzano. 

Arkansas State was able to score only two goals because of the coordination of the defenders and mid fielders.

This game showed the talent, focus and skill that has shown itself from time to time this season, the same focus that would have come in handy during the Golden Panthers' four-game conference losing streak.

The Sunday game against the University of Arkansas-Little Rock was looking very good as Miriam Mercado scored her first goal of the season but as the game progressed, the long season and short roster came back to haunt the Golden Panthers as it has many times before and they fell short 2-1.

It is obvious that 2007 campaign for the Golden Panthers has been far from perfect, and there is always room for improvement. 

But despite the hardship, there are some bright spots to enjoy. 

One of the bright spots  is the underclassmen, especially the freshmen of this team. 

At this point, the freshmen have contributed eight of the fifteen goals scored by FIU this season, and 4 of the 15 assists.  

Cardenas is going to be the centerpiece of the team for the next few years. 

She possesses the ability to not only draw defenders, but she is the best finisher and ball handler on the team. 

An impressive feat considering this was her first year as a Golden Panther.

The only question is whether she will be able to lead the team and if now that she will be a sophomore, if the pressure of improving will affect her play.

While adjusting to life as Division I soccer players, this group of freshmen have shown that they can shine given the opportunity. 

As time goes on they will not only be able to shine in the chances given to them on the field.

However, they will be ready and willing to create their own chances and also create havoc for any opponent FIU will face in the future. 

The season concluded with the team losing more than ten games and winning less than five, and it has been a hard  to watch.

But first year head coach Thomas Chestnutt and fans still have young talent to watch develop before their eyes next season.

Headline: Commentary: Switching to Division I caused  football team's ordeals
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The FIU football program this past year has lived through a domino effect of miscues and humiliation.

At first glance, the bench-clearing fight could be tagged as the first domino to fall.

However, after a police report stated four football players disrupted a class by suggesting a female biology lab assistant looked better with her lab coat off, the first domino cannot be the brawl.

The transition from Division II to Division I is the one event that has led to the detrimental change in culture within the football program. 

A mentality of superiority that has permeated throughout the program despite never winning one game as a Division I school.

With every controversy that the football team is involved in, they resemble the University of Miami more and more but without winning. UM student-athletes have been involved in a plethora of violations over the years.

Former athletic director Rick Mello prematurely pushed for FIU to move up to the Division I level, and as of this moment, the decision could not look anymore hurried and unplanned. The first game of the 2007 season should've sent warning signs to all fans as FIU was crushed 59-0 by Penn State.

The transition to Division I is the root of most of the problems the football program is facing today. 

The team was winning some games and improving against lower tier teams during their time in Division II. 

Switching to Division I placed FIU against opponents out of their league. So out of their league, that they are not even learning anything. 

Instead they are being embarrassed versus programs that have existed before FIU was built.

Another problem the transition brought was the concerted effort by the Athletic Department to make football their number one priority. The goal is to give the university prestige, but unfortunately, investing so many resources into the football program has given the team the idea that they have already made it onto a big stage.

When the football team was first created, they were a humble group just happy to be playing college football at all. 

Now they have new stadium being built, and they are playing against ranked teams; therefore, it is reasonable for some players to have a more arrogant mind-set.

If the players are constantly being told how important they are to FIU's future, and how they can launch FIU up to a new stratosphere, then they are going to think too highly of themselves.

In order to change that mentality, the Athletic Department will need to bring some players back to reality by enforcing the laws that were suppose to end the trend of "bad boy" student-athletes that several top universities have dealt with.

When athletic director Pete Garcia succeeded former AD Rick Mello, Garcia arrived with a no-nonsense agenda. He proved it by investigating the University's history of abiding NCAA bylaws as soon as he was hired.

Therefore, the four players will most likely be reprimanded harshly.

If the Athletic Department wants to continue to prove to faculty and students that they are committed to recruiting student-athletes dedicated to academics, then they will have to somehow make an example out of the four players.

Although the players wrote letters of apology to the lab assistant, they shouldn't be getting themselves into any type of predicament where they could be suspected of committing such an act. 

The four players and their teammates must understand that their actions do not only affect their own reputations, but if just  few of them violate a law or embarrass themselves, then the whole football program suffers.

Since the football program is an entity representing FIU, the whole university suffers.

Headline: Bonds to deny Hall of Fame induction if ball has asterisk
Author: Mike Fitzpatrick / Ap Wire
&nbsp;
BarryBonds would boycott Cooperstown if the Hall of Fame displays his record-breaking home run ball with an asterisk. That includes skipping his potential induction ceremony.

"I won't go. I won't be part of it,'' Bonds said in an interview with MSNBC that aired Thursday night. "You can call me, but I won't be there."

The ball Bonds hit for home run No. 756 this season will be branded with an asterisk and sent to the Hall. Fashion designer Marc Ecko bought the ball in an online auction and set up a Web site for fans to vote on its fate. In late September, he announced fans voted to send the ball to Cooperstown with an asterisk.

Of course, the asterisk suggests Bonds' record is tainted by alleged steroid use. The slugger has denied knowingly using performance-enhancing drugs. Fans brought signs with asterisks to ballparks this season as he neared Hank Aaron's career home run mark.

Bonds has called Ecko "an idiot."

"I don't think you can put an asterisk in the game of baseball, and I don't think that the Hall of Fame can accept an asterisk,'' Bonds said. 	

''You cannot give people the freedom, the right to alter history. You can't do it. There's no such thing as an asterisk in baseball.''

Hall of Fame vice president Jeff Idelson declined to comment Thursday night.

Hall president Dale Petroskey has said accepting the ball doesn't mean the museum endorses the viewpoint that Bonds used illegal substances. He said the museum would be ''delighted'' to have the ball.

"It's a historic piece of baseball history," Petroskey said in September.

So, if the Hall goes through with the asterisk display?

"I will never be in the Hall of Fame. Never," Bonds said. "BarryBonds will not be there.

"That's my emotions now. That's how I feel now. When I decide to retire five years from now, we'll see where they are at that moment," he added. "We'll see where they are at that time, and maybe I'll reconsider. But it's their position and where their position will be will be the determination of what my decision will be at that time."

Giants general manager Brian Sabean reiterated Thursday that the team won't bring back Bonds next season. The seven-time NL MVP, who has spent 15 of his 22 major league seasons in San Francisco, was asked whether he will retire as a Giant.

"Yeah, it's my house. No matter what that's my house, no one's going to take that away, no one ever," Bonds answered. "No one's going to take the love of that city of me away, ever."

Bonds, who has 762 homers, broke Aaron's record with a shot into the right-center seats off Washington Nationals pitcher Mike Bacsik at San Francisco on Aug. 7.

Matt Murphy, a 21-year-old student and construction supervisor from New York, emerged from a scuffle holding the ball. He said he decided to sell it because he couldn't afford to pay the taxes required to keep it.

Bonds told MSNBC he hoped to reach 764 homers because he was born in July 1964. He said he's been working out and still is considering whether to play next season.

"I may hit two home runs so I can go home. I just think that I have a lot of game left. I think that I can help a team with a championship," Bonds said. "I'm a hell of a part-time player, too."

Bonds said he won't talk to George Mitchell's staff looking into steroids use in baseball while he is under investigation in the BALCO case. A grand jury has been investigating whether Bonds committed perjury when he testified he never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs.

"I know it ends in January, so a couple more months. But I haven't been keeping up with it. Not at all," Bonds said. "I have nothing to hide. I have said that before and I will say it now and I will look you in the face. I have nothing to hide, nothing. So look all you want to."

Headline: Last second field goal downs Golden Panthers
Author: Jose Martinez / Asst. Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Determined to snap their 20 game losing streak, FIU (0-9) ventured into Arkansas for a second straight game, to take on Sun Belt Conference rivals Arkansas State (4-5) who found themselves in a vulnerable position, missing their quarterback, sophomore Corey Leonard due to unspecified reasons.
Leonard appeared before the game, in uniform, but was eventually replaced by second stringer Travis Hewitt, who has seen little action this season after losing playing time to Leonard.

In spite of this, the Arkansas State Indians seized their fourth win, by breaking the 24-24 tie that lasted into the final five seconds of the game. A 32-yard field goal by kicker Josh Arauco defeated the Golden Panthers. The win was made possible by strong performances from Hewitt, cornerback Darren Toney, and running back Reggie Arnold. 
Hewitt completed 19 of his 30 attempted passes, finished the game with 174 passing yards and rushed for 24 yards on 15 carries. Toney led the charge defensively, racking up seven tackles and 161 yards in returns. The offense was spurred by Arnold, who totaled 120 rushing yards on 20 carries, and single-handedly led a fourth quarter Indians rally with two touchdowns.

Quarterback Wayne Younger commented on the game saying, "this was a team effort, we're going to go all four quarters playing as a team.... we're going to lose as a team and win as a team, and that's all I can say."

In spite of the loss, the Golden Panthers saw standout performances from safety Lionell Singleton, quarterback Wayne Younger, and running back A'mod Ned. The offense executed well enough to have FIU leading Arkansas State 9-3 at halftime. 
This marked the first time throughout the season that FIU led a game at the half. Singleton's 188 yards in returns, which included an 80-yard touchdown scoring punt return in the second quarter. The defensive unit, which faltered in the fourth quarter by allowing Arnold's two touchdowns and Toney's 60-yard kickoff return, played one of its strongest games of the season.
