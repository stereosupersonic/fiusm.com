Headline: America's past time is still a favorite
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Who wrote this script? Sure, the Boston Red Sox were favored coming into the American League Championship Series to finally beat the Yankees, dispel the infamous curse, and make a World Series appearance for the first time since 1986. 

But after being dominated by Pedro's pin-striped daddies in three straight games, even the most optimistic Beaneaters considered burying themselves in the Big Dig.

Things like this aren't supposed to happen. Maybe we should be expecting this sort of thing, considering who won the last three World Series Championships.

I think I'm finally starting to figure this out. We have to throw logic and probability to the wind and learn to expect the most ridiculously implausible outcomes out of the Major League baseball playoffs. 

How else could you explain the long-shot Florida Marlins beating the Yanks in game six, in the Bronx, on a complete game shutout by a short-rested Josh Beckett in '03? Or the '02 World Series in which Anaheim found itself down three games to two against Barry Bonds' Giants?

The Cinderella Angels overcame a 5-0 deficit in game six to force a game seven. John Lackey became the first rookie pitcher in 93 years to win a World Series game seven and pull that off. 

How about the four-year-old Diamondbacks winning it all in '01? The D'backs lost three straight games in Arizona before the Big Unit dominated the Yanks to force what turned into one of the best deciding games in World Series history.

Talk about a story-book finish. Co-MVPs Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson started and closed the game respectively.

The Red Sox are simply continuing a trend that has brought baseball back to near National Football League status: wildly dramatic post-season play, preferably involving the demise of the Evil Empire.

Yet, this moment in baseball history is somewhat different from those big wins of the past three years. 

This championship series  managed to completely overshadow the National League Conference Series in which baseball's best team may reside, possesses that 'where were you' quality that survives generational boundaries. 

This will be the thing they talk about in Boston for as long as the Bobby Thompson home run survived in New York. Old men with nasal accents will tell their grand kids how the Sox were just an inning away from being swept by the Yankees in 2004. 

They'll recall how Hall-of-Famer Mariano Rivera, the most dependable big-game closer of the era, was three outs away from handing Boston its most embarrassing loss in Fenway history and blew it. 

The old men with their nostalgic grins will tell the story of Curt Schilling, who pitched a brilliant game six with a torn sheath in his Achilles tendon, wearing a special shoe, wrapped in tape, spotted with blood. The legend of Mr. October will be told and exaggerated. 

David Ortiz's walk-off homerun in game four and walk-off hit in game five will be cemented in their minds as though it happened days ago instead of years ago. 

They'll talk about how Johnny Damon, a caveman impersonating a ballplayer renamed the Sox "The Idiots", went on a 3-for-29 slump in the League Conference Series, then hit two home runs in game seven, one a grand slam to put the sox up 6-0.

That's the beauty of post-season baseball.  Every play has the potential to be the most important of a player's career. 

Three outs are a lifetime, nine innings an eternity. It takes just one swing of the bat to incite a rally. 

Everything can change with one bad pitch and the most humiliating sweep in post-season history can become the greatest come-from-behind story in all of sports. That is what has made people tune back into baseball.

Headline: Running comes naturally for Howard
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Golden Panthers Women's Cross Country team is streaking toward the Sun Belt Conference meet with only one thing on their minds: reaching the NCAA Regional meet. 

The outstanding performance of the team's lead runner, Amanda Howard, is one of the major reasons for the program's success. 

Having posted a personal record in her last meet at the Disney Classic, Howard is eyeing a top-ten finish in the conference, something her coach Steve Rubin stressed earlier this season.

The Beacon sat down with Howard and found out about preparations before a big race and the mental efforts needed to get through it. 

Q: When did you first start running and whom can be credited with getting you started? 

I started running in sixth grade. I ran the mile well in gym class, and my P.E teacher told me I should join the track team.

Q: Why did you decide to come and run at FIU? 

The experience to be in a culturally diverse atmosphere brought me to FIU.

Q: Who has been your biggest influence as a student athlete at FIU? 

Coach Salvat, he has always been encouraging to me [and has] stuck by me through tough times. [He has] always believed in me.

Q: Describe a typical day in the life of Amanda Howard.?

[I] wake up at 6:00 a.m., pick up my teammates, and depending on what day it is, practice could be a long run followed by weight training or a hard workout. [Workouts include] eight 800's with a mile and a half warm up and a mile and a half cool down. I always eat breakfast with some of my teammates after practice, usually in the cafeteria. [Then] I go to class throughout the day, sometimes study at night, and then go to bed. 

Q: Describe a typical race day?

I wake up and eat a banana or have a small breakfast depending on what time the race is. [Then we] get to the course about an hour-and-a-half before the race starts, try to relax, warm up and then we stretch about half an hour before the start.  When the gun goes off we try to get out quick so we don't get stuck behind people. 

[You] try to keep your mind strong and focused on the race; I try to think of all the training and sacrifices I have made to run a good race and, at the same time, keep my body relaxed. [You] give it all you got till the end, and when the race is over [you] try to get everyone together to cool down and talk about how they did and how they felt during the race. We always congratulate and support one another on the race.  

Q: What are the types of things that are running through your head before the gun is shot on race day? How about during the race as well as after? 

Before the race I try to stay calm and not even think about it. [I] forget where I am and think about something else ...lose myself for a couple of minutes. During the race all I think about is the hard work I put into every practice, waking up early every morning to make myself a better runner as well as all the times I had to go to bed earlier then I would have liked because I had to wake up for practice or weight lifting. 

I tell myself not to slow down because I know that my teammates are working just as hard as I am and feeling just as tired as I am; [you] keep pushing through for one another. After the race I replay it back in my head and try to make sure there were no times were I gave in.

Q: Having run last year, what are you doing differently at races as well as at practice this year? How have you benefited from these changes? 

I have been more confident in myself this year, and I think that has made the biggest difference, not expecting myself to be at a certain time or place.

Q: What are your personal expectations for the Sun Belt Conference meet? What about for the rest of the team?

I would like to place in the top ten, which is all conference. For the team, I think we are all going to run very well. Everyone is mentally strong and ready to show up and run. I think we will get first or second ... hopefully first.

Q: You still have two full years of eligibility left after this season, what do you hope to accomplish before the end of your career at FIU? 

I hope to win a team conference title and individual All-Conference one too. I look to break 18:00 for five kilometers as well.

Headline: Apartment complex loses its seclusion
Author: Jonathan Banke / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It has been over a month since school started, and little seems to have changed to the new entrance still under construction connecting the University Park Apartments to Campus Drive. 

On a warm Thursday afternoon, I sat at my desk in my apartment building and gazed off into the distance down Garden Drive to the west, into the sunset, waiting for our new intersection to open.

Traffic continually backed up, sometimes twenty or thirty cars deep on the primary loop around school. It seems the problem builds more everyday, with no relief in sight.

The first time I saw construction workers laying pavement, I was stunned. 

This is my fourth year in the apartments, and the construction of the new road insulted me. As large as our campus is, the UPA housing complex is the only building or area at University Park that is completely isolated. 

Residents, staff and visitors must briefly leave campus to enter our facility. With only one way in and one way out, most people seen around the apartments have a reason to be there. 

More relaxed  than other student housing areas, the atmosphere of our complex is calm and private. 

Ask many new commuter students where the University Park Apartments are located, and they are likely to respond, "We have an apartment complex on campus?" 

The serenity is priceless if you appreciate a little peace and quiet, especially during finals week. The  new construction is going to change everything. 	   At first I thought it was a  horrible decision to build a new entrance to my apartment complex, but it must have been the season of political flip-flop in full swing, because in the first week or two of the semester, something changed my mind. The more I thought about it, the more the new road grew on me. 

To drive simply to the Graham Center, for example, I would no longer have to go through two lights and a sometimes-nightmarish traffic circle. Suddenly, one quick left, and there it is. 

Access to the rest of campus will also be much easier thanks to our new roadway. 

I believe my fears of  Garden Drive becoming another Southwest 16th Street I believe are overexaggerated. 

Most commuters will continue to leave campus via Southwest 16th Street, Southwest 8th Street or the newly constructed drive just east of the Green Parking Garage. 

I am sure traffic will increase slightly, but nothing that will be too noticable to residents here at the University Park Apartments.   

This new accessibility will make commuting to and from practice and games much easier for our many athletes in the apartments.  It will also make things easier for students who want to cheer on our many sports teams. 

Last but not least, in an emergency, university police and other authorities may be able to save precious time arriving on scene.

The main question still left unanswered, however, is why hasn't the entrance been open to the public? 

Over the phone, university parking and traffic officials said  that they had no idea why the road was closed and did not even have an estimate far when it would be open. 

Perhaps, work days and opportunities to finish the entrance have been disappearing with the hurricane threats.

However, as a former road worker, a quick visual inspection shows no problems with the asphalt, road paint and traffic signs. 

Electrical work is to the  road's shoulder, away from the intersection.

"This work has nothing to do with the road. I'm not sure why this road is still closed,' said sophomore Cody Jacobs, a concerned UPA electrical worker and UPA citizen. 

And so, the question still remains: When will this intersection be opened? University Park Apartment front-desk workers did not have an answer and neither did an aide on patrol from Public Safety. 

With housing costs continuing to rise, students deserve explanation.

Headline: New program set to deter students' plagiarism
Author: Jamie Klapholz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The factors might be many: laziness, procrastination, lack of time or any emergency to spring up at the last minute. Whatever the case may be, some students resort to plagiarism as a last resort when that crucial paper is due, and in the past decade, the internet has made cheating as simple as the press of a button.

At FIU, university officials have decided to take action this semester to discourage students from turning in the work of others. For this reason, officials registered for Turnitin.com.

Turnitin.com, established in 1994, was one of the first websites of its kind to be created.

Its system is able to detect plagiarism by comparing student papers that professors submit to text found on the Internet.

This process takes thirty seconds and, when complete, the professor receives an "Originality Report," with all plagiarized passages highlighted.

Although the university is just trying Turnitin.com for a semester, approximately sixty teachers have signed up to use it.

"I have a little more assurance that my students are writing their own papers," said Barbara Weitz, an English professor, who recently began using the program in her own class.

Most faculty members would agree that the biggest perk about using Turnitin.com is that students will not attempt to cheat because they know the program' will catch them.

"We are looking at it to deter plagiarism," said Dr. Kenneth Johnson, assistant vice president of Academic Affairs.

However, plagiarism detection is just one of the many services that the Turnitin.com provides for professors. 

Peer Review allows students to evaluate each other's writing anonymously, while Grade Mark allows professors to grade assignments using the system. 

Grade Book, another program within the site, lets teachers manage grades and attendance.

With Digital Portfolio, students can track their academic progress over the length of their  entire college career.

With all of these services, Turnitin.com may soon become a part of the FIU academic community life.

So far, the program has proven to be more than helpful.

During the height of hurricane season in September, Johnson took advantage of the various programs to keep in touch with his students, even though classes were cancelled.

He was able to post assignments on the site and have discussions, so that when the university reopened, his students were not behind on their classwork.

If FIU officials decide to commit to the system, it is possible that teachers will begin using the program as soon as next semester.

However, the site's fees are somewhat expensive, and more university officials need to commit to it during the trial period before it can be used in the future.

"Although some of my students are frustrated with kinks in the system, once you get used to it, it really can work," Weitz said.

Headline: Events promote breast cancer awareness
Author: Katherine Beale / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This year, over 215,000 women will learn that they suffer from breast cancer, the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer among females.

As those numbers rise, many forget that the illness remains one of the most curable cancers, with only 18 deaths for every 100 women diagnosed this year.

In order to educate the community about this disease and its prevention, FIU has set up special events during the month of October, Breast Cancer Awareness month.

The health care centers at both University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses are offering free breast cancer screenings during October to help female students understand the necessity of an annual clinical breast exam.

 "Breast cancer is very curable if it's caught before it [has] spread," said Sara Baker, resident nurse of the University Health Center at BBC. "Breasts are easy to examine. You can't do this to your lung," she said, poking her ribcage.

According to research performed by the American Cancer Society, the earlier a tumor is caught, the greater a patient's chances of survival. In fact, the ACS estimates a 97% five-year survival rate for women with breast cancer caught before they spread to other areas of the body.

The health centers offer literature on breast self-examination, as well as free clinical breast exams, year-round.

Elvira Velez, associate director of the Health Care and Wellness Center at BBC, explained the reason why breast self-examinations are important. 

"Part of the strategy [is for] women to feel comfortable with their breasts," she said.

According to Velez, a woman will become familiar with the shape and texture of her breasts through monthly examinations, so she will be able to recognize any changes.

"If there's something unusual, come in and have it checked out," Velez said. 

Student leaders on campus are also doing their part to raise awareness of cancer issues.

Samantha Morgan,   hospitality management major and resident assistant at Bay Vista Housing, planned a program on breast and testicular cancer awareness, inviting staff from the BBC health center to give a presentation on early detection and prevention.

"So many lives have been touched by this disease," Morgan said. "Yet...the moment people hear about it, they go the other way." 

Junior Marlene Quincoces, a liberal studies major, currently serves as the FIU event mentor for "Relay for Life," an annual overnight walk-a-thon that raises funds for the ACS and its research.

"I have been a part of this amazing event for five years now, and my story is pretty simple," Quincoces said.  "I believe that everyone should live happily, free of pain and suffering. Unfortunately, there are so many people afflicted with this disease that are suffering, and this is one way we can help."

To aid early detection, the ACS recommends that all women over the age of 40 have a mammogram every one to two years and a yearly clinical exam.  

Mammography is not recommended for younger women, as their more fibrous breast tissue may yeild false positives. A lump found in a young woman's breast is usually examined by ultra-sound. All women, regardless of age, should perform a monthly breast self-examination and should encourage each other to do the same.

"Young women can be the biggest support systems for their moms and aunts... [they should] encourage them to get exams," Velez said.

Headline: Art cuts new image into jackolantern
Author: Beverly Fortune / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
LEXINGTON, Ky. - Pumpkins for pies. Pumpkins for plain old jack-o'-lanterns. We're all familiar with those. But Dr. Vu Nguyen takes one of those big orange orbs dotting the fields and turns it into an art form.

He carves portraits out of his pumpkins.

"Origami is my first love. I do more origami than anything else, but this is fun," said Nguyen, 39, a psychiatrist.

Nguyen (pronounced Win), a native of Vietnam whose family came to Louisville, Ky., in 1975, said he never carved pumpkins as a child. It was not part of Vietnamese culture. In Kentucky, he said, "maybe once my dad carved a pumpkin for us, with triangles for the eyes and nose."

Five years ago, Nguyen became interested in carving "just for the heck of it," he said. "I used a knife - it didn't work very well - to carve different faces like a cat's face and lots of designs."

His carvings became more elaborate, and Nguyen searched the Internet for new ideas; he found directions for doing photographic portraits.

Each pumpkin portrait takes about three hours from start to finish.

"Like with anything, the more you do it, the faster you get, and you begin to develop your techniques," he said.

The keys to success are choosing a large pumpkin and sturdy tools. Nguyen doesn't use pumpkin carving kits because the tools aren't big enough, strong enough or sharp enough. He buys tools designed for wood carving and making pottery. Instead of using a knife, he bought a scroll-saw blade from the hardware store and a small handle for it.

"Once you start cutting away the mid-tones, achieving different shades of gray, is when I have to use a lot of artistry," he said.

The Michelangelo of the pumpkin patch will start the week before Halloween, carving one or two every night, he said. Some will be portraits, and others will be what Nguyen calls extreme pumpkins: boldly carved, with a pyrotechnic aspect as flames shoot out the top.

All will be used as decorations for the Halloween party he and his sister, Trang, are giving Halloween weekend.

STEP-BY-STEP

To demonstrate how to do a pumpkin portrait, Vu Nguyen carved a likeness of his sister, Trang, a graphic designer in the Lexington Herald-Leader advertising creative services department.

We've also included tips from a Web site, www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joystuff/macolanternshowto.html.

-The tools: You'll need a scroll-saw blade and handle, small paring knife, scoop, wood carving tools, face-paint crayon and projector.

-The pumpkin: Start with a large pumpkin. If the pumpkin is too small, you'll go crazy trying to carve the intricate details.

-The guts: Cut a generous-size lid that extends part-way down the back of the pumpkin. Remove seeds and insides. Wash the pumpkin inside and out with dishwasher soap and water. Dry.Using a scraper, scrape away part of the inside to thin out the rind so light will shine through.

-The photo: Select a photograph with a clean background and sharp black-and-white contrasts.

"If you don't have a good picture to start with, your pumpkin won't turn out good," Nguyen said.

He used Photoshop software to remove the color from the picture and to boost the contrast between black and white tones. Leave gray tones because that is what will distinguish the portrait from the usual jack-o'-lantern carvings.

-The transfer: With a small tracer projector bought at a crafts store, Nguyen projected the photo onto the side of the pumpkin. He then traced the features, including the nose and mouth, with face-paint crayon. 

He also outlined areas on the nose, cheeks and forehead that were white tones.

-The cuts: With an X-acto knife, cut around the crayon tracings. Next, cut out the white highlights on the nose, cheeks and forehead. Keep the photograph close by to refer to.

-The shave: Before shaving away rind from the gray areas to create different tones, Nguyen put a white Christmas light inside the pumpkin to shine through the rind. The light helps when you shave away layers of pumpkin pulp, creating a three-dimensional affect.

-Wash and rinse: When finished, put the pumpkin in the sink, and wash away the remaining crayon lines with soap and a sponge.

-The secret to aging: Rub Vaseline to seal the surface and hold in moisture. WD-40 also works.

Headline: Skindred mix reggae and metal
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Page Designer
&nbsp;
Who would have thought the day would come when reggae and heavy metal would join together to become a mix of clashing, inharmonic noise? Well, that day is here, and it has come to us in the form of a Ukrainian band called Skindred. It's Beanie Man, meets Slipknot, meets Godsmack, meets The Clash, meets vomit.

Somehow the band managed to make the U.S. New Artist Top 10, but, since then, radio stations aren't really playing their new single, "Nobody." In my opinion, they are just another band to add to the list of others that achieved the U.S crossover, but they probably won't last long enough to mark their territory.

I must admit, the idea of combining hip-hop, reggae, dancehall and heavy metal is very imaginative, and, to some extent, creative, but who honestly is going to listen to it? 

Music listeners interested in heavy metal probably hate reggae, and vice versa, causing a never-ending chain of half-fulfilled listeners not very ecstatic to press the next button on their cd players, and pushed more towards the off.

Skindred's songs have been available over the Internet since about 2001 and recently became available in the U.S. on their debut album, Babylon. The album showcases a variety of different sounding songs, each with its own musical genre. 

The first couple of songs feature the reggae-sounding lead vocalist rapping a tongue twister of words that really doesn't make much sense under a microscope, including such clichélyrics as, "My sound we come to take over, MC you better look over your shoulder, yeah you know were on, oh well now... and," All I want to do is make the people rock, but then I heard the words, I never trusted you lot, and why don't you go back to Africa."

Just because the lyrics and over all musical quality of the band doesn't seem to impress even Britney Spears fans, drummer Dirty Arya seems to know what he is  doing. 

If you actually analyze the type of approach he is taking, you will note that he is trying his best to keep an actual musical and rhythmic style and sense. 

If you would like to take a glance at Skindred's video of "Nobody" and  see all this for yourself, you can try tuning to MTV2 some time late at night and wait for it to come on.

Headline: Award-winning poet brings words to life at BBC
Author: John Rubio / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Writers on the Bay brings poet Tony Hoagland to Florida International University. His works include "Sweet Ruin" (1992), which was chosen by Donald Justice for the 1992 Brittingham Prize in Poetry and won the Zacharis Award from Emerson College and "Donkey Gospel" (1998), winner of the James Laughlin Award. His latest collection is "What Narcissism Means to Me" (Graywolf Press, 2003). 

According to The New York Times Book Review, "'What Narcissism Means to Me'"has the appeal of a mean-but-funny friend, a smart aleck you can't dismiss." Hoagland's poems and critical writings have appeared in such publications as "Ploughshares," "Agni," "Threepenny Review," "Gettysburg Review," "American Poetry Review," "Harvard Review," and the 1991 Pushcart Prize anthology.

The award-winning poet will bring his words to life Thursday Oct. 28th at FIU's Biscayne Bay campus, AC1264. The poetry reading will begin at 8p.m.

"Dickhead," "Leaving Yourself Behind," "Fred Had Watched a Lot of Kung Fu Episodes," "Suicide Song," and "Hate Hotel," are some of Tony Hoagland's vivid poem titles.  Enticing the reader with eye-grabbing words is just the beginning of what Mr. Hoagland does. Using wit and humor, this wordsmith captures his readers' attention with insightful and creative poems.  At the turn of every page there is the anticipation of what else is in store. Whether its laughter, sadness or wonder, his poems are honest and direct, at times analyzing life and everyone's involvement in it.  

"We ourselves were fighting the Time Wars:we could feel it speeding up, rapidly escaping,like the hiss from a leaky balloon.We were trying to plug it, to slow it down, to decelerate,but none of us was having much success" 

- "The Time Wars."

Hoagland's poetic collections also possess blunt truth and touch upon a vast spectrum of issues like racism, capitalism, homosexuality and human emotion. Instead of preaching, he shares his own experiences, gives the reader a glimpse into his life and delves into unanswered questions.

"No longer do I live by the law of me,

No longer having the excuse of youth or craziness,

And dying you know shows a serious ingratitude"  

- "Suicide Song."
