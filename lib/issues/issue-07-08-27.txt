Headline: Environmental initiatives led by task force
Author: Samir Ahmed / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Modesto Maidique, the University's president, first committed to making FIU more environmentally friendly, Damian Fernandez, the University's vice provost, was busy merging a coastal environmental theme with the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Fernandez's initiative resulted in a task force that crafted a preliminary report recommending a three-phase process. The process would involve hiring faculty, adding physical setting improvements and including interdisciplinary courses in journalism, hospitality management and marine sciences, among others, over a long-term period. 

Though some of the interdisciplinary courses are already being taught at BBC, they may work toward a thematic concentration of courses or a certificate.

According to Fernandez, some of the possible courses would be cruise management within the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management and an environmental reporting class within the School of Journalism and Mass Communication.  

Some task force members, such as Peter Craumer, associate professor in the Department of International Relations, see the recommendations as unique to BBC as well as to the nation. 

"The existence of both Hospitality [and] Tourism Management and [SJMC] on this campus, together with Marine Sciences and the proposed new resources in social sciences and humanities, is a combination rare in this country in a coastal campus, if not unique," Craumer said. 

The recommendations also include the hiring of an environmental coordinator who would manage an array of matters from outreach services for elementary and high school students to teaching and research support.

Because the report was a mere "thinking exercise," no decisions have been made to approve any of the proposed recommendations, according to Fernandez. "This has been an internal document for us to think about. Clearly all this is on hold given that the University is in a budget crisis," he said.

The Board of Governors of Florida has asked the state universities to prepare for a budget cut that can range from 4 to 10 percent of their overall budget. Despite this, Fernandez wants BBC faculty and administrators to 'go out and secure funding' from corporations, foundations and private individuals. 

"As entrepreneurs we need to raise our own funding in areas that we are competitive in," he said. 

According to Fernandez, BBC's small size is ideal for creating interdisciplinary courses. 

"This is almost a liberal arts college setting with professional schools so those connections are easier to crop given the scale of the campus and the number of programs here," Fernandez said. "We have scarcity of resource so we have to find creative ways of making these disciplines work together to maximize the availability of interesting programs for our students."

 Michael Heithaus, assistant professor of Biological Sciences, has been involved with the task force since its creation in January, and he is optimistic on the future of the recommendations at BBC.

"Hopefully we can have situations such as discussing literature involving the sea while you're close to it at the bay, instead of in a classroom, which would actually get people motivated to come up here," Heithaus said.

Headline: Faculty Spotlight: Bert Delgado ~ Professor of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication
Author: Ever Cruz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Bert Delgado is proud to say he speaks in a direct and commanding tone in the classroom.

"I drive students crazy so they can excel," said Delgado, a television production professor within the School of Journalism and Mass Communication. "This is a demanding industry and they have to learn how the industry operates."

So when Delgado was asked to be a talent judge on  Mission: Reportar, a reality show on Galavision, a Spanish cable station, he was proud to introduce himself to the contestants as el m&aacute;s terrible or "the most terrible."

"Don't be surprised if I tell you this is no good," Delgado warned the contestants on the show that aired during the summer.

Nonetheless, Delgado claims that during the course of the show he was lenient when judging the contestants, who were competing for a chance to land a job as a television news reporter.

"I was less severe with them than with my students. As a matter of fact they expected me to be Simon Cowell but purposely I did the opposite. I preferred the other judges to be more critical to the contestants," he said.

The students who worked on the "Footprints" documentary under Delgado's instruction, such as Romy Santana, an FIU alumna, have also said he is a very straightforward teacher.

"It was either be humiliated or be proud of your work. It was a challenge for us," Santana said. "I felt we accomplished more than what we expected. At the same time I felt we deserved it. We worked hard on it."

This documentary, put together by senior broadcast journalism students last Fall as their final project, was about the Skunk Ape, a Bigfoot-like creature that is believed to reside in the Everglades. 

It won Best Student Film Documentary award at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival.

"I was happy for them because it gives them exposure. It lets them be seen," Delgado said.

Delgado supervised production of the documentary and offered suggestions on what to do differently.

"I hope each group of students [in my classes] makes something that excels. Sometimes productions will take a life of its own and in this case, this was one of them," Delgado said.

Santana said that without Delgado's input, the documentary would not have been the same. As a result, she was proud of her work.

"We knew it was good, we put in a lot of effort and we knew it was a good quality film, but yeah, it was a surprise to win an award especially since competition was really high," she said.

Claudia Echevarria, an FIU alumna, also worked on the documentary. From her experience on "Footprints," she learned that she is the only one that can limit herself. 

Delgado's toughness contributed to the success of the documentary, she said.

"Bert is amazing, he projects a totally different guy than he really is," she said. "He plays the tough teacher but he's really sweet and he always supported us."

Delgado was born in La Havana, Cuba in 1940. He studied in Rome, Italy where he specialized in film and television. 

After graduating, he settled in New York where he was chief of operations of WNEW-TV Channel 5, the principal channel of Metromedia.  

He arrived in Miami in the early 1970s where he began his teaching career at Miami-Dade College. 

He came to FIU in 1986 after being convinced by some staff. He also wanted to move to another plateau in his career.

"I thought it was a challenge and some people from FIU wanted me to go teach there," he said.  

Delgado teaches all aspects of television production from directing to writing within SJMC.

Over the years, Delgado has received various awards. From FIU, he has received the Award of Excellence in Teaching, The Award of Excellence for Lifetime Achievement and others. 

He's also been awarded  the Key to the City of Miami by the state of Florida for his public service in television, which includes producing, directing, and editing programs aimed at child safety.

Delgado also takes pride in keeping in touch with his former students as well as helping them acquire jobs. He said that he does this to ensure that the relationship with his students lasts beyond the end of the semester.

Delgado retired from FIU in February, but he's been rehired and is returning in the Fall. 

"I like doing this. I think I can guide people into television," he said.

I'm teaching something that changes so much, I have to keep myself updated in order to teach these students."

Efforts under way to rename School of Journalism and Mass Communication:

Jane Daugherty, a journalism professor, along with a group of professors within the School of Journalism and Mass Communication have started a fund-raiser to have the school renamed in honor of Gene Miller.

Miller, who died June 2005, was a two-time Pulitzer Prize Award winner and a Miami Herald reporter and editor for 48 years.

 According to Daugherty, Miller was known for his hard-hitting, fact-filled reporting and clearly written news stories. 

It would cost $5 million to obtain naming rights. Daugherty has already received help from Caroline Heck Miller, a former Miami Herald reporter and Miller's widow. 

Other FIU faculty and Miami Herald staff also are involved in this initiative, but students can help as well. 

The campaign is accepting donations from both individuals and foundations. 

According to Daugherty, an honorary fund-raising campaign committee will be announced in a week or two. 

For more information, contact Daugherty at Jane.Daugherty@fiu.edu. 

 

Freshman Luau to be hosted at BBC:
The BBC Vice Provost's office, Student Affairs, Campus Life and the Wolfe University Center are hosting a freshman luau on Aug. 30 at Panther Square in the WUC.

The luau will take place from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and is a part of Welcome Week, a series of events to welcome back returning students and introduce new students to the University.

A live band will be playing throughout the event. There also will be free Hawaiian-style food and giveaways. 

Incoming freshmen will be welcomed to FIU by either Damian Fernandez, the University's vice provost, or Cathy Akens, the assistant vice president of Student Affairs.

Headline: BARGAIN BOOKS: Web sites save time, money for budget-conscious students
Author: Danielle King / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the beginning of the Fall semester underway, it's time for students to get acquainted with their classes and find out what books they need to buy. While many students are braving the long lines at the campus bookstore, others are turning to online resources for better prices on expensive texts. 

The following web sites are some places to visit to find cheaper books and timely delivery on otherwise pricey class materials.



Directtextbook.com:
Directtextbook.com uses a search engine that checks for books by areas such as subject, author and International Standard Book Number. Users can view a book's description and compare the book's price on several web sites such as Barnes and Noble's and Amazon.com, letting students find the most affordable price among popular online sellers.

For students such as Ada Hernandez, a senior at Florida Atlantic University, the site is a provider of reasonably-priced textbooks, which she finds useful because she has paid several hundred dollars for only one book. 

"The prices of books are ridiculous," she said. "It's hard enough to pay tuition, but then you have to buy books for these classes where one book alone can set you back $300. My book for biological basis of behavior was $320, and I still had other classes to buy books for."


Half.com:
Half.com is a web site that's a branch of ebay.com. It provides the option of both buying and selling books online and features new and used textbooks. Before you can use the site, you need to register for an account. If you have an ebay account, however, you can use it as your Half.com account, too. 

Unlike ebay.com, there is no listing fee for sellers and the listing lasts until the item is sold, so the chances of finding books are relatively high. 





Bigwords.com:
This is a newer web site where the savings are higher with the more books purchased. The web site prides itself on saving an "average of $45  a textbook." You can also search for digital texts and even international books.

The site also checks for different coupons and promotions that can be used toward the final price, saving the buyer even more money.

According to Tia Walker, a sophomore at FIU, it's inconvenient searching for books in a crowded bookstore, so sites such as bigwords.com allow her to buy books without leaving her home.

"Using online sources makes book shopping easier and more convenient," Walker said. You use the search engine to find the textbooks that you are looking for and then use a credit card to purchase the books.  It's then delivered to your house in days."



Textbooks.com:
This web site stocks thousands of textbooks and offers free shipping on books costing $25 or more. The shipping time ranges from two to seven business days; however, this free shipping is a limited-time offer.  

Also, textbooks.com offers 'guaranteed buyback' on certain texts, meaning that the books can be sold back for at least 50 percent of the original price once students are done for the semester.

Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man.
-David Bowie, "Changes"



It has been four years since I walked into my first dormroom, unloading boxes as my parents cried and bemoaned the departure of their eldest son.

My college life had started. Water balloon fights across abandoned playgrounds; midnight rides through the Everglades; joining study groups that never really got around to studying - the adventures piled on that first year.

Now I'm beginning what I hope will be my last semester here. I've signed up for classes, bought some of the books and gone through the preparation rituals that precede every term, but already I feel as though this year will be a little less adventurous.

The reason? I've joined the professional workforce.

Though I had a steady job at the school paper, I never really considered it work. The hours were tailored to my class schedule, my colleagues were all my age and I could be at the office as long as I wanted, which left plenty of time to fit youthful escapades into my loose schedule.

But during this past summer, it seems I somehow stumbled into adulthood.

I now work at a major daily newspaper where I sit in a cubicle from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. writing a variety of stories. I drive the 40 minutes it takes to get home when I'm done, eat a microwave dinner, check my e-mail to see what I'll be expected to do the next day, then fall asleep at around 10 p.m.

I do enjoy my work very much, but the schedule I've crafted to make sure I do the best job possible has made me realize something: my life has changed.

Sometimes changes are gradual and we don't realize things have shifted until after the fact, such as aging or when acquaintances become friends. But other times, life changes so quickly that the effect can be daunting.

I've been chronicling different views on life in this column for the last two semesters, noting how ordinary people, philosophers, writers and even myself perceive the meaning of our existence and our role in the world.

But it took a small cubicle to remind me that the way we see life often depends on our circumstances at that moment.

The world seemed like a large, unexplored frontier as I stood in the dorm doorway four years ago. Now it seems like an orderly, predictable path where I measure happiness on how punctual I can be to my next meeting.

But how will it seem after I graduate, or if I decide to start a family, or even tomorrow?

Life continues to flow like a roaring tide, and I will keep walking around its shores, searching for the answers.

Headline: Neurosonic: Terrorist accusations mark band's tour
Author: Scott Fishman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After initial success with his former band Out of Your Mouth, Jason Darr feels he finally came into his own creatively as frontman for the band Neurosonic. 

The group is currently on tour as part of the Family Values Tour.

"We definitely wanted to be on one of the big tours of the summer," said Darr, who jumped at the opportunity of performing on the tour when the idea was brought to him while working shows with the band Army of Anyone. 

Performing on such a big tour is a dream come true for Darr, who is a huge fan of Korn frontman Jonathan Davis. 

The up-and-coming singer, songwriter, guitarist and producer even had the chance to play a few games of Texas Hold'em poker at a number of tour stops with Davis.  

"I remember looking at my cards and putting them on the table to look up and realizing I'm playing cards with one of my idols," said Darr. "He won the first night. I knocked him the second night, but one of the musicians in his band took the whole pot. I haven't won yet."

Playing cards is a favorite activity to pass the time for the Canadian, and the artwork on Neurosonic's debut album Drama Queen is proof of that - it features a rather demonic queen card.

"When I was younger, I used to play poker with my family," said Darr. "For birthday parties, while most kids played Monopoly, we played poker."

Much like the card games he plays, Darr took a chance signing with the growing Bodog music label after leaving Sony BMG Canada. 

He said that since the signing and the album's release last year, the record company has supported Neurosonic in every way possible. 

The group has been enjoying its biggest exposure yet with a slot on the Family Values Tour. 

"It's always surprising to us because we are just so excited to be there, so it's even more exciting to see people excited to see us," said Darr. "We always have the philosophy that we are going to kick the crap out of every audience who dares get in front of us."

His group received added exposure last year when he was suspected of terrorist activities because of his pedal board case and other equipment being deemed suspicious and seized by transportation security administration. 

Darr also taped Neurosonic's set list to the board, which consisted of most of the songs on Drama Queen; The list was suspected of being encoded with terrorist language. 

It even went as far as Homeland Security in Chicago phoning him with allegations of suspicious activity and notifying him that bomb-sniffing dogs were going through his gear. 

He has since received his equipment back in one piece. 

"It's funny we get a lot of people ask us about it," said Darr, who posted a number of entries about the ordeal on the band's blog. "I couldn't believe the reaction we got. I'm still hearing about it. It's one of those things we laugh at now, but it was such a hassle." 

With the incident behind him, Darr can focus on his work. 

After recently rocking the Sound Advice Amphitheatre during a Family Values Tour stop in West Palm Beach, the group reacquainted itself with its dedicated South Florida fans and made new ones. 

"Neurosonic is the headbutt after the handshake," said Darr. "The live show is crushing and undeniable. It's the Beatles meets Nine Inch Nails. I guarantee anyone who sees this show is going to end up with their heads in their hands."

After finishing the final dates of the summer tour, the group is scheduled to head off for a number of international dates in the fall.

Headline: Trivium: Group strives for American fanbase
Author: Scott Fishman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Thousands of rockers braved torrential rain to hear the band Trivium at the Family Values Tour when it made a stop at the outdoor Sound Advice Amphitheatre in West Palm Beach earlier this month.  

The group performed on the tour's main stage along with headlining bands Korn and Evanescence. For Trivium drummer Travis Smith, 25, the weather provided a unique accompaniment to their head-banging set list, which ironically included the song "Rain." 

The showers were a welcome change to scorching temperatures Smith was becoming accustomed to on previous dates. 

"We're just a couple of guys on summer vacation going city to city," said Smith, born in Bainbridge, GA and now based in Orlando. "We just hang out together under tents, sitting in chairs, drinking tons of beer." 

Trivium formed in 2000 and is made up of Matt Heafy, Corey Beaulieu, Paolo Gregoletto and Smith. They have traveled the world playing alongside the likes of Metallica and Iron Maiden. 

"It's pretty much like banging your dream girl," said Smith, who's known for his fast footwork onstage. "Then, having your dream girl right there at your disposal that you can do anything you want with."

Smith grew up knowing this was the type of life he wanted. His father, also a musician, gave him his first drum kit at the age of five. He has been playing ever since. 

"On a Saturday, he and I would be jamming, setting up the kit in the living room," said Smith. "I think that's where it all came from. I then started finding my own bands and it took off from there."

Now in the ever-evolving Trivium, Smith said the group has established itself in countries such as the United Kingdom. However, he believes the challenge is building a broader fanbase state-side. Doing high-profile shows like the one in West Palm Beach is bringing the band one step closer. 

"It's more of a mainstream crowd because we're still an underground band," said Smith. "So sometimes we [have] to realize that Europe is a different story. There are a lot of people who haven't heard of us. Then we go to Europe and we're used to them freaking out. There are a lot of new faces and new ears that are taking time to listen."

Trivium will continue its road schedule with dates in Australia, Amsterdam and England in support of the 2006 release The Crusade. The group also plans on heading back in the studio to work on a next album.

Headline: Review: M.I.A. - Kala (Music)
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If M.I.A.'s goal with Kala is to surround her listeners with sound, then she should feel accomplished. The album, much like her 2005 release Arular, is strangely addictive - a great mix of Bollywood-inspired sounds, fast beats and even faster words.  

Like the roadrunner mentioned in its lyrics, the first track "Bamboo Banga" is reminiscent of a car chase, except M.I.A. is the driver and you're just along for the ride. 

"XR2" has been available via MySpace for quite some time, but the album version is a remixed track with more fast-paced, electronic-styled sounds than the original, surprisingly enough. 

Timothy Z. Mosley, better known as Timbaland, makes an appearance on the track "Come Around" - proving everything that the man touches turns into gold. He has worked with the likes of LL Cool J, Nelly Furtado, Justin Timberlake and Madonna's upcoming album, so a collaboration between him and M.I.A. is rather unexpected, but the duet doesn't disappoint. The track sounds like it could be a club favorite.

In Arular, M.I.A. uses different interludes and even a hidden track to ensure songs flow correctly. 

This tactic proved effective because for the most part, the album can be heard with no pauses between songs. In Kala, however, songs seem to have no specific sequence whatsoever. Though still effective in its own way, the latter seems to just be a collection of songs rather than a storyteller.

A big difference in this album compared to its predecessor is that M.I.A actually sings in some songs and doesn't just spit her fast lyrics and dumbfounding beats all the time. The Sri-Lankan "songstress" has had minimal voice training and it showed when she performed the 70's disco-style "Jimmy" at Lollapalooza this summer. 

The song, which features several high-pitched squeals and lines in a higher range than M.I.A is accustomed to, was apparently too much to handle live and left audiences with hurt ears and dropped jaws. You can watch all the action for yourself on Youtube. 

For M.I.A. to attempt a singing voice in her sophomore album shows evolution as an artist, but the better songs are without a doubt the ones that make you listen a little closer to what she's saying. 

In "Jimmy," a song about an American journalist M.I.A. fell in love with, she sings: "When you go Rwanda Congo, take me on ya genocide tour, take me on a truck to Darfur, take me where you would go. You told me that your busy, your loving makes me crazy, I know that you hear me, start acting like you want me." 

It's comforting to know that amidst songs about prostitutes, warlords and poverty, M.I.A. is still able to write a song about heartache.

The Japanese release of Kala features three bonus tracks "Far Far," "What I Got" and "Big Branch" that will be available through iTunes soon, according to M.I.A. fan websites. 

Kala, without a doubt, proves that M.I.A is not a one hit wonder and highlights her music-making abilities.  

However, if she can't hack it live, then maybe she should sing some of those songs an octave lower and spare the crowds.

Headline: Editorial: Shuttle adjusts to new schedule
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Right on time for the new school year, the Department of Parking and Transportaton had a change of heart and decided to change the Golden Panther Express shuttle schedule to more closely match the new M-W-F class schedule. 

The schedule didn't change by much. Buses will still leave from each campus roughly every hour and a half. The difference, however small, is that a second back-up shuttle will be leaving 20 minutes after the first bus leaves.  

This means that students who have to take an early shuttle to make it on time to a class could cut their waiting time by as much as 20 minutes. It also means someone who misses the first bus can still take the backup shuttle - much better than waiting for the next bus an hour and a half later. 

And if a bus breaks down on its way to another campus, there's a backup shuttle only minutes away that can take stuck students quickly to their classes.

It's a marginal improvement, at best, but it's still something. 

The real importance of the shuttle schedule change is in the message it sends to students. It shows Parking and Transportation is becoming more willing to take students' best interests to heart, even if it gives administrators a logistical headache. 

The reason Parking and Transportation couldn't make more dramatic changes in the bus schedule is simple: it costs too much. Adding two new shuttles to FIU's fleet so that buses could depart every 30 minutes would have raised the shuttles service's operating costs by a whopping $200,000 - an unacceptable sum for a public university already forced to cut costs during a lean budget year.

That said, FIU has always claimed that the two separate campuses make one university. If it at all believes in that claim, it ought to invest in uniting the two distant campuses. 

But any change in the shuttle schedule, however nominal, marks a change in attitude on behalf of Parking and Transportation. Its director, Bill Foster, was initially intent on sticking with the old shuttle schedule, no matter how inconvenient it was to students dealing with a new M-W-F class arrangement. 

Now, Parking and Transportation is even putting together a survey to find out why students use the shuttle service. It's even raffling a $50 shuttle ticket to encourage students to take the survey. 

That willingness to hear students out is refreshing, and one important step in unifying BBC and UP into one campus.

Headline: Editorial: Debates should be open to students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
An inspection visit from non-profit organization Leadership Florida earlier this month could put Florida International University in a spotlight role  in the national political arena. 

The visit placed FIU among a handful of Florida public universities in the running to host a set of primary presidential debates in January.

The debates would be televised statewide and take place over two evenings - one for the Republican candidates, another for the Democrats.

It would mean honor, prestige and visibility for FIU if it's chosen to host the debates. 

And regardless which one of the public institutions is chosen, it will mean a definite score for civic discourse.

Whether the FIU, the University of Florida, the University of Central Florida or Miami-Dade College end up hosting the event, hosting Florida's primary presidential debates at a public institution rather than the private University of Miami is a big improvement. 

Say Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association, which is co-organizing the event, do pick FIU to host the debates, thought. 

Beyond boosting their school's name in the public eye, it's not clear how much the debates would concretely benefit FIU students.

Ideally, having a political event of national importance take place on campus would present an occasion for students to get a face-to-face, live and in person civics lesson. 

That is, if they actually get to see the debates. 

But even at this early stage of planning, it looks like few students will be given access to watch the debates in person. 

Stephen Sauls, FIU's vice president for presidential relations, says it's up to the campaigns, not FIU, to determine the seating arrangements in the 700-seat Wertheim Performing Arts Center where the debates would be held.

If FIU is picked to host the debates, university authorities ought to demand that students get to watch. The event must benefit FIU students, concretely and not just nominally.

Headline: COMMUTING CONUNDRUM: Treats and trials of commuting to FIU
Subheadline: In Favor of Dorms
Author: Jose Martinez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
While the stresses and strains of Miami traffic, along with the ungodly heat experienced on a daily basis pose quite the hurdle for many FIU commuters, in the end, the benefits may outweigh the costs for some.

It may seem for many individuals that the ultimate convenience is merely waking up from a comatose slumber and walking over to class, not a care in the world, wandering the campus in pajamas, eagerly anticipating the next opportunity to catch some Z's. 

This is hardly an accurate depiction of the true intricacies of living on-campus. The continual comings and goings of complete strangers into and out of your living space, the ever-increasing mess piling up in your cell-like bedroom, the financial burden placed on already lurching shoulders, are among the more mundane, yet thoroughly disheartening aspects of dorm life that make traveling to school all the more convenient. 

The reality of having to live in complete autonomy, while adaptive for some, who are eager to transition into what they perceive to be "adulthood" may be a frightening circumstance for many.

 Commuting to FIU affords one with the luxuries of not having to abandon one's family for most of the year, and fosters a comforting peace of mind that familial solidarity and support is still possible.

Living with several other people with distinct personalities will almost certainly create some degree of conflict. How would you like to be paired with a roommate who has a penchant for watching pornography between the hours of 3 and 4 a.m., or a stoner who smokes at least four or five times a day? Not a very refreshing thought, is it? 

Perhaps the most rewarding aspect of commuting and choosing to live with your parents is the amount of money you save to use for things other than housing costs, tuition, a meal plan, and books. It is comforting to know that you have money left over from financial aid to treat yourself to things that would otherwise be inaccessible were you to live on campus. Rather than depriving myself of ammenities that would make life more enjoyable,  I would rather forgo the headaches that accompany living on-campus.

&nbsp;
Imagine not having to slog through Miami traffic to get to campus. You wake up and you are already here. Food venues on campus, saving you a lot of precious early-morning time. 

You can wake up a moment before class starts: life is good.

For roughly 88 percent of Florida International University's 38,000-plus students, this picture is a fantasy.

I would love to live in campus housing, were it not for the very high price tag that comes with it. A studio in University Park Towers costs $3,772.00. A 4-bedroom single in Lakeview costs $4,288, or about $1,000 a month. It would be cheaper to just rent your own 2-bedroom apartment close to campus to share with a roommate. 

Twelve percent of all FIU undergraduates - about 4,508 of them - can afford to live in housing. The other 33,057 of us have to commute here.	

As a commuter to FIU I sleep less, feel more exhausted, have less time, and endure Miami traffic everyday - the list goes on and on.

As a commuter you must wake up between one and two hours earlier. If you do not wake up early, you risk being stuck in Miami traffic - anywhere from 40 minutes to several hours, depending on where you live. 

Then wake up early and scarf down breakfast, or else forgo the meal and fall asleep in class.You then have to take everything that you will need that day with you and lots of cash if you want to afford the high-priced food sold on-campus.

On your way to campus you will encounter gridlock traffic, only to arrive to deal with FIU's shoddy parking system. Put simply, you have a higher chance of being mauled by a wild polar bear in the middle of the Graham Center than finding decent parking at FIU.

The only benefit of commuting is it's cheap - living at home, you can save yourself an estimated $8,000 on housing alone. 

But for me to live on campus, I would have to take out an $8,000 loan each year and eventually have to pay it back with a high interest rate. 

It's sad to say, but given those conditions, I guess I'd rather drive.

Headline: Review: The Flaming Lips - U.F.O's At the Zoo (DVD)
Author: Chris Towers / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the release of U.F.O.'s At The Zoo: The Legendary Concert In Oklahoma City, The Flaming Lips shows bands such as  The Arcade Fire, Radiohead, Tool and many others that they are in fact the greatest live band. 

Others who might feel they have a claim for the title might have to watch the DVD to get some pointers.     

The band creates an atmosphere at every show; balloons, confetti and people in costumes make the band's shows feel more like a gigantic party with thousands of your closest friends than a rock concert.

But the biggest part of it has to be that The Flaming Lips understand fans better than any other band.

Throughout a 20 plus year career, The Flaming Lips have written songs about Spongebob Squarepants, karate fighting robots and plastic, dash-mounted Jesus figurines, and yet despite these seemingly unrelated (and frankly, silly) topics, there has always been a basic idea common to the band's songs.

    And that common thread, that thing that The Flaming Lips understand better than any band I've ever seen live is that life is tough. Life is depressing, crappy and it rarely turns out the way we hope. And yet, despite this, you have to celebrate the simple, joyous fact that you are alive. 

    This has been a basic idea in many Flaming Lips songs and it becomes obvious during live performances that, above all, a goal is to ensure that each person in the audience has the best possible time, and at least for a little while, forgets his or her problems and just has a good time.

    The Flaming Lips have now put one of its most famous shows out on DVD. 

Filmed during a triumphant return to their hometown after a four year absence, The Flaming Lips played to a crowd of thousands of adoring fans, many of whom showed up hours before the performance in full costume to get into the mood of the show.

  Descending from a UFO hanging above the stage, The Flaming Lips wowed the crowd with a passionate performance spanning more than two hours and covering five albums worth of material, from 1993's Transmissions From The Satellite Heart to 2006's At War With The Mystics. 

    The DVD features the full performance as well as interviews with fans and band members. 

The concert is shot in high quality video, giving you the closest possible experience short of being there yourself. 

And, while it's impossible to fully recreate the overall feeling of any live show. this DVD does a good job of showing just what it is that makes the Lips' live shows so special.

Headline: CHANGING TIMES: Shuttle times adapt to new class schedule
Author: Elvis Ramirez / BBC Life Editor
&nbsp;
The inter-campus shuttle schedule has been changed to coincide with the new three-day schedule.

Students will no longer have to worry about taking the shuttle and having to wait at either campus for more than an hour before class, as would happen if the old shuttle schedule was left intact. 

Bill Foster, the director of Parking and Transportation, presented four different shuttle schedule options to the Classroom Utilization Implementation Committee on Aug. 11, responsible for the Monday-Wednesday-Friday class schedule change. 

American Coach, the current shuttle service for the Golden Panther Express, prepared the schedule options for the committee.

These recommendations included leaving the bus schedule unchanged; having a bus leave every 45 minutes with no backup shuttle; having a backup leave 20 minutes after the first bus and adding two buses, with a bus leaving every 30 minutes and again leaving no backup.

According to Foster, each shuttle has a maximum capacity of 55 passengers. This poses a problem if there is no backup shuttle because there are more than 55 passengers who use the service at any given time. Because of this, the committee recommended having the backup bus leave 20 minutes after the first. 

"It still leaves at the time that they've memorized, the first [shuttle] and then the next one would leave after it at a 15 or 20-minute interval. That would help minimize the wait," Foster said.

The University will not incur any additional cost with this option, he said.

The committee decided that the option of adding shuttles would be too expensive, although it would resolve all schedule conflicts, said Corinne Webb, vice president of Enrollment Services and chairperson of the CUIC. 

If the committee had recommended adding two  shuttles with a shuttle running every 30 minutes, the cost of operating the service would have increased from the current  $700,000 to $910,000. 

The 30-minute option would have increased the shuttle ticket prices by the next school year, Foster said.

While Foster was unavailable to comment on why the shuttle schedule was changed without student input, he did address the issue in a July 23 interview with The Beacon.

"Again, this is brand new so we are going to see how it works, if there are any changes we can make, we'll do it, but we have to make sure the changes help everyone, not just a small group of students."

At the committee meeting, Foster said he had received complaints about the previous shuttle schedule from five students.

"It's just five people that have contacted me about the schedule," Foster said, "I guess you need to put it into perspective, but you still have five kids who are not going to class the way they want to go to class."

The Department of Parking and Transportation plans to survey students who use the shuttle during the Fall term. 

Terry Whitherell, associate vice president of the Department of External Relations, is working with Foster's department to develop the survey.

Students will receive the survey as they board the shuttle in order to find out their reasons for using the service in September.

A $50 bus pass will be raffled off to a student as an incentive for students to complete the survey. 

 Some committee members expressed worry during the meeting about students not taking classes at BBC due to the previous shuttle schedule. 

"I think that students are going to make some choices based upon convenience. 

"If students perceive that the [shuttle] schedule doesn't allow them to take classes on both campuses, if that's their desire, then, yes, of course, it is a concern," said Cathy Akens, assistant vice-president of Student Affairs and a committee member.

 "A lot of students may not even realize there is a conflict until they start being late to class everyday or being super early," said Katiana "Kathy" Saintable, Student Government Council president at BBC and a guest at the meeting.

The vice provost's office posted the new shuttle schedule on the Biscayne Bay Campus Web site, bbc.fiu.edu.

Headline: Maidique answers tough questions
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
The Beacon met with FIU President Modesto A. Maidique to talk about the state-wide university budget cuts and other recent University developments.



Q: How is FIU dealing with the budget cuts that were recommended by the Florida Board of Governors?
A: We're going to try and minimize the impact on students because we are going to try to not touch those activates which are core. The core mission of the University is to teach students and make available the courses and faculty we need to do that. Anything that is not part of the fundamental mission is second. 
Q: Do you think these cuts are going to affect your "FIU At 50" plan?
A: No, because we are going to try and manage through these cuts by becoming very selective as to what we do without changing the core, which is to improve the undergraduate experience, improve our graduation rates and continue to expand our research base. We think we can do it without touching those three pieces.


Q: Are these cuts going to make it harder for prospective students to get accepted into FIU?
A: It will affect the people who want to come to FIU more than it will affect FIU's mission. It will really affect FIU's mission in terms of the access piece. We're turning away students with a 3.4 GPA and a 1100 SAT score, which are excellent students. We just can not continue accepting students … If we can not get the students that we have funded and are carrying 700 unfunded students and 1,000 students funded at 60 percent at what they should be funded, how far can go without lowering the quality of education?



Q: Do you  think that the legislature doesn't understand what public universities are going through? And do you think more power should be granted to the Florida Board of Governors?
A: More than the fault of the legislature, it is the fault of the cycle of the economy because housing and construction are down, the receipts of the State of Florida are down a billion and a half, and that billion and a half translates into a 4 1?2 percent cut and it looks very likely that that is going to happen. I believe there is good chance that we will get some relief at the next legislative session. 



Q: Is there any specific reason why the University of Florida, Florida State University and University of South Florida were allowed to increase tuition? 
A: Politics



Q: Does politics get in the way of providing better education?
A: Whenever legislatures get involved in establishing academic policies, very positive things can happen or not so positive things can happen. The Board of Governors is authorized by the constitution to make those decisions and we, as [University] presidents, have the responsibility to implement those policies.



Q: Can you talk about the recent announcement of a $5 million anonymous donation to the School of Medicine?
A: The donor requested anonymity until they make the decision, which is coming up shortly. They will decide by August and we should be able to announce it by September. All the documents including all the details with nothing redacted will be available to you. What the donor wants to do is what any donor would like to do: they want to announce when they are ready to announce. That's assuming they agree. We're ready to accept. Are they ready to give? We'll know in a couple of weeks



Q: Is this common practice?
A: It's a common practice that a donor does not want his or her name in the press until they are ready to make a commitment. Sometimes we get to the eighth inning and it doesn't work out, so the donor doesn't want to be embarrassed.

Q: Are there any new developments regarding the online books lawsuit?
A: We have sought what is called summary judgment, which means: dismiss it. This is not serious. It's still tied up in court basically.

Q: A while ago you said you wanted 20 percent of full-time students to be living on campus. Where are we out now?
A: We're at about half of that. Our full-time enrollment is a little over 20,000, so 30 percent of 20,000 would be 6,000 full time students on campus. We now have 3,000 students living on campus. 

Q: Any plans to build more dorms on campus?
A: We have a massive plan to build dorms between the football stadium and the performing arts center and make a little city similar to Miami Lakes over there, dorms lining the parking on one side and dorms lining us, with a little open mall in between the two sides of the dorms.

Q: Is FIU considering expanding south into Tamiami Park?
A: I think expanding south is a non-starter. Tamiami Park is one of the few parks that are available around here and it has a tremendously supportive constituency. At one point we thought about it, looked at it and it didn't make sense. We are having talks with the Youth Fair - which is not part of the park - about a possible deal there.


Q: Can you make any bold predictions about this year's football season?
A: I predict that we will win a game, which, if we do, will make us definitely better than last year. Last year we went 0-12 so if we go 1-11, we're definitely better than last year. I also predict that we are going to be in a lot of games where people expect us to be out of.

Q: Do you think with new leadership the football team will be able to turnaround last years 0-12 season?
A: I think we have an extraordinary head coach. Both he and athletic director [Pete Garcia] have put together a formidable coaching staff. The head training was the head trainer for the Orlando Magic. Prior to that, he trained Olympians and other professional teams. He is an extraordinary man, I personally train with him.


Q: I heard that you are pretty strong yourself. 
A: My maximum benching is 225 and 600 pounds leg press.


Q: Is there something you could share that students might not know about you?
A: I used to be a pretty good ping-pong player. I've been in championships and I've won at [the Massachusetts Institute of Technology]. My ping-pong team, out of about 100, ranked second. I did not play the lead; I played the number two position. I also used to teach people dance when I was in college and won a few trophies in dancing competitions.


Q. What type of dance did you teach?
A.  Latin dance, particularly merengue.

Headline: Downloading music not free for all
Author: Susana Rodriguez / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Downloading the latest hit might sound insignificant to some students, but it may come with a big price.  

In April 2007, the Recording Industry Association of America sent 433 pre-lawsuit letters to universities: 16 were served to FIU students. 

"It is technically and actually theft if you take a song and don't pay for it," said Katie McGee, assistant director for the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution. "When you download illegally, you're violating use of property rights that companies like the RIAA own."	

FIU's network Acceptable Usage Policy states "any receipt, retransmission or destruction of software or data must observe copyright laws, license restrictions and University policies." 

"Before users get on to the network, they have to agree to this," said John Cabarga, marketing coordinator for University Technology Services, in reference to FIU's Automatic Internet Protocol Registration System. "It's not just students; faculty and staff have to agree to it, too. Even if you call the UTS Support Center, you have to agree to the policy before you sign in to the network."

Cheryl Granto, IT security officer for FIU, Division of IT, said connection to the new wireless network was also granted by accepting the policy. She added FIU's not reporting network download activities: the RIAA is the one watching pirate file sharing sites. 

"They're joining the peer-to-peer groups and watching the traffic - they've hired a company to monitor file sharing," said Granto, "Their techniques are being questioned and the RIAA hasn't disclosed all of them." 

McGee said companies that own the file's property rights sent the school detailed information about the violations: the computers' Internet Protocol address, software used, download time, even duration. 

"We're warm and fuzzy compared to the criminal record that will follow these students for the rest of their lives," McGee said. "I don't think they realize this has long term adverse effects: you apply to grad school, they'll run a background check, and guess what? There's that record that shows you downloaded illegally. It may not prevent you form getting a job but it will give employers pause."

In response to the increase in misuse cases this past spring semester, the SCCR, UTS, and the Student Government Association are presenting alternatives to illegal downloading.

A solution may be Ruckus Network, a free file sharing subscription service that allows college students free, unlimited music downloads to their computer paid for through advertisements. 

UP-SGC President Marbely Hernandez said of Ruckus, "It's sort of like Napster meets Facebook. You're allowed to see what songs your friends have downloaded and download songs they have."

Currently FIU's legal services are reviewing the contract between the University and Ruckus. Hernandez said barring any setbacks posed by legal services, it should be approved.

"One of the concerns of the University is they don't want students downloading anything that has spyware or ad-ware," Hernandez said. "It's a cool entertainment tool, but we want to make students aware of [illegal downloading.] This gives them an alternative solution they can use."

Music mobility, however, is not free.

"Out of the box we offer free unlimited music to your computer. If you want to transfer music to your mp3 or music player, the only legal way Ruckus offers it is to purchase the song," Cheely said. "Once you graduate, you can convert to alumni accounts or pay for the music to keep it." 

Students can also pay a monthly $4 subscription fee to transfer their full Ruckus libraries to mp3 players. 

A list of service compatible players is available at playsforsure.com. Cheely said iPod is incompatible because Apple won't allow integration with their system although Ruckus is working toward a future solution.

The University will also launch the Computer Misuse Campaign starting this September to educate students about illegal downloading.  

"It's not really fair to hold students responsible when they don't know the expectations and consequences," said McGee, "I think it's important to get this across to students because they say they're not hurting anyone but they are: they're hurting themselves."

Chief Information Officer Min Yao would not comment on the subject and referred The Beacon to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. Calls to the CFO office were directed to Media Relations. Media Relations was not able to respond by publication deadline.

Headline: More laptops, study space on SGC's to-do list
Author: Vanessa Alvarez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This is the first of a running series titled "Meet SGA." Read an analysis of SGA's budget in next Monday's issue.


It's finals week and the library is packed and there is nowhere to sit.  To wait for a laptop would take a day and renting a study room is completely out of the question. 

Yet there's no time to waste.  Sounds familiar? 

This is one of the issues the new Student Government Association administration plans to address.   

As one of its goals for the new school year, SGA has taken an initiative to increase the study space available for students.

One way in which it plans to do it is by offering students the no-cost option of renting classrooms at the Graham Center through SGA's website.  

This is SGA's goal number six of 12 University Park goals the new administration put together during the early summer months. 

Five University-wide goals were also compiled and resulted after hours of brainstorming at cabinet meetings and group retreats.  

"If I could sum up this [upcoming] year in one word, it would be change.  My biggest goal is to see many people running next year and wanting to get involved in student government," said UP SGC President Marbely Hernandez. 

Following the aftermath of Virginia Tech, much emphasis was placed on safety. As a result, another UP-SGA goal named Mobile Campus will offer students and campus organizations the ability to stay informed and communicate with one another through text messaging in case of an emergency. 

Once Mobile Campus is implemented sometime next Spring, all student organizations will have free access to it, allowing them to communicate and stay informed, whether on or off campus.  

Another UP-SGA goal, which the administration aims to accomplish or at least build a stepping-stone for future administrations to achieve, is the enhancement of an online advising program. 

According to Hernandez, the program, which will be incorporated into the MyFIU Web site, will break down the number of credits students must take each semester, making it easier for students to also track their progress towards graduation.

"We want to accomplish each and every one of the goals or at least build the foundation for future administrations to do so.  We felt a lot of things needed change, specifically with last year's goals," said SGA Vice President Arthur "AJ" Meyer.

Contrary to last year's ambitious list of more than 25 SGA goals, which were not entirely achieved, SGA was very careful this year with the amount of goals it set for its agenda, keeping in mind the importance of being realistic. 

Jose Toscano, assistant director for campus life, said the administration has focused on coming up with goals that were not only essential but also attainable. 

"I made sure that I spoke to Marbely and AJ to encourage them to set realistic goals …I believe that I'm working with a phenomenal team of leaders," Toscano said.  

In fact, of the 12 UP goals, three have already been fulfilled and one is currently in the works.  

By this Fall semester, students can expect a plethora of laptops and laptop locks to be available in Green Library. 

The locks, SGA hopes, will help fight laptop theft on school property.  

Furthermore, as a student safety initiative, SGA will also offer students with the PantherTram shuttle service beginning this Fall; a service that will also prove beneficial for alleviating traffic and parking jams across campus.  

As one of five University-wide goals, SGA at UP primarily hopes to increase the bi-campus communication between itself and the Biscayne Bay campus. 

According to Hernandez, this year will witness a major increase in bi-campus events.  

"What people tend to forget is that we're not two different universities, we're one," Hernandez said. 

Besides the mentioned goals, SGA hopes that students will also chose to use the customer service comment boxes that will be placed all over campus, specifically made available in the administrative offices where students tend to have the most concerns.

But chiefly, the new administration seems focused on leaving its footprint for future administrations and in FIU student government involvement. 

"[Running for President], I felt was not only an opportunity for myself, but also with my experience in student government, it was a chance to create change for SGA," Hernandez said.

Headline: FIU among possible hosts for presidential debate
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Politically savvy FIU students may be pleasantly surprised to know that a set of presidential debates may be held right on campus this January. 

Leadership Florida, a non-profit organization that brings public awareness to the conditions and challenges of Florida, and the Florida Press Association, are organizing the two statewide-televised debates in the Sunshine State, one night each for the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. 

NBC also became involved by becoming the network sponsor of the debates.

"There seems to be a desire to have the debates in Miami," said Stephen Sauls, University vice president of government relations.

Sauls attributed the desire of wanting the debates held in Miami due to the large Hispanic and  black voter blocks, in addition to Miami being an exciting city. After being approached with the possibility of hosting the debates, FIU agreed to be considered. 

The first step was a site visit by Leadership Florida earlier this month.  According to Terry Witherell, associate vice president of external relations, the inspections went well.

"Any question they raised we had an answer or solution to," Witherell said.  

The main debates would be held in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, which can hold roughly 700 attendants, while the media would be stationed in the Graham Center. 

If held at FIU, the debates would have limited access for students. However, at the current time, it is unknown how many students would be able to actually watch the debates in person. According to Sauls, seating for the debates would be at the discretion of the campaigns. 

Anthony Rionda, the lectures coordinator for the University Park Student Government Association says that SGA will fight for as many student seats as possible if the debates are going to be held on campus.

Witherell stated that student seating is still being negotiated. 

"We have good experience hosting dignitaries," Sauls said.

After the University hosting Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and the Dalai Lama, Sauls hopes that will put FIU over other venues being considered for the debates such as the University of Florida, University of Central Florida and Miami-Dade College. 

"There is no negative you could get out of it," said FIU College Republicans' President Juan Carlos  "Juanky" Robaina. "It would be great to have all the candidates in one place."

Besides the possibility of the presidential debates being held on campus, SGA has passed a resolution to invite individual presidential candidates to FIU, Rionda said. 

"We're sending identical proposals to all the candidates," he said.

Rionda also commented that SGA would be taking a party neutral stance when it comes to the candidates. Candidates will not be allowed to attack their opponents and their discussions would be limited to their own lives and experiences. 

It is still unknown whether or not any candidates will make any kind of appearance on campus, but the administration is hopeful of the prospect. 

According to Rionda, SGA will also be hosting a voter registration drive during the Fall semester before the December primaries.

Headline: UTS fights hackers with network upgrade
Author: Andrew Leins / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Starting this fall, when viruses attack,  FIU is going to fight back with a new series of computer programs. 

Following concerns about serious network security breaching, which in the past required investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FIU is undertaking two major projects to help protect the computers of faculty, staff, and students. 

According to Min Yao, vice president and chief information officer of FIU's Division of Information Technology, FIU's e-mail system receives over one million messages every day--two-thirds of these e-mails turn out to be junk mail and, many times, viruses disguised as it. 

The Cisco Clean Access Project will affect those using the University wireless network, who will now have to login by entering their FIU e-mail, username and password. 

The software will then check that the computer is up-to-date with the latest anti-virus software and operating system patches. If the computer is in need of updates, users will be directed to a default page containing links where they can download what they need. 

 Some may be concerned about having to purchase new software, especially if their anti-virus is out of date.

 "I think this is a good concept, but does this mean that we are going to have to buy new software? We shouldn't have to pay any more money for something that we've already paid for," said senior Daniel Duarte. 

Fortunately for students like Duarte, all needed upgrades will be available free of charge, such as Windows Defender, which protects computers from spy ware, and other anti-virus software. 

The University Technology Services also offers other software at discounted prices, such as McAfee anti-virus for only $10.

"We are not trying to impede the students but these measures are for everyone's protection," said John Cabarga, marketing coordinator for UTS.

As part of the Cisco Clean Access project, there is also an initiative to place wireless access points in every classroom throughout the University and in key open areas at University Park, the Biscayne Bay Campus, Pines Center and housing areas. Access points have already been installed in Lakeview, Everglades Hall, and Panther Hall. 

Funded by the University Strategic Initiative Fund, a grant from the Office of the Provost, and a contribution from Residential Life, Cisco Clean Access will cost $680,000. 

 The Active Directory project, the second security project undertaken by the University, will update University computers with the latest anti-virus patches, provide for encryption of data and data recovery, and check the strength of passwords used to login to the University computers - which will have to be eight characters long and contain at least two digits.

All faculty and staff desktop computers will be migrated into the directory, which, according to Cheryl Granto, officer of the IT Security Office, will be a first for Florida universities.

"This is a giant undertaking and it has been overdue for some time," Granto said.

Already in use for several years in the computer labs, Active Directory will provide even more protection features for faculty and staff. 

Computers will lock up after 10 minutes of sitting idle and passwords will expire after 90 days. 

Microsoft provides the software for Active Directory through FIU's licensing agreements with the company, and the project is expected to be completed by December. The total cost of the project is $260,000, which will cover hardware, software, and a total of 480 labor hours. Funding will come from the University Strategic Initiative Fund, the Division of Business and Finance and UTS.

 "I think this is great for the University in that it will create a secure working environment for everyone," Yao said.

Headline: Commentary: Quarterback, team identity main
Author: Luca Messina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With so many question marks surrounding the FIU football team following its complete overhaul, realistic FIU students should expect moderate improvements at best in 2007. 

As the season opener is roughly two weeks away, the team heads to Happy Valley (Penn State University for those of you who don't know) with so many uncertainties that it's almost impossible to forecast a successful campaign. 

For starters, the Golden Panthers are coming off a winless 2006 season that was not only embarrassing but emotionally draining. Last season went way beyond mere losing as the negative hoopla surrounding the on-field fight with the University of Miami football team created a miniature three- ring circus. 

When all was said and done, the Golden Panthers left 2006 without a coach, without a win and most importantly, without an identity.

Enter new head coach, Mario Cristobal, the Miami native was hired in December of last year to not only steer the ship in the right direction, but also to install a critical element that is a necessity in the wonderful world of organized sports, a sense of identity. If he is able to establish this quality, then the Golden Panthers will have certainly created a starting point.

The next key idea on which the team's success hinges is the quarterback position. As of right now, Cristobal has yet to officially reveal his offensive general, but all signs are pointing toward spunky upstart redshirt sophomore Wayne Younger. 

Even though fellow sophomore Paul McCall has in-game experience, Younger has impressed not only in the spring game, but in training camp as well-leaving many to believe that Cristobal will indeed throw a wildcard out there from the get go.

If Younger can adapt well to the spread offense and the rest of Cristobal's schemes, FIU will possess something missing from last year: offensive output. 

One would think that a winless campaign would produce a softer schedule the following year, but the polar opposite occurred in 2007. FIU opens the season with four straight games against Division 1-A powerhouses. 

After the opening game against Penn State, the Golden Panthers challenge Maryland, UM and Kansas, which are all tough opponents. After those contests, the schedule begins to soften and involve in-conference opponents, which FIU played competitively against last year. 

Putting the first four games aside, if the team can play their Sun-Belt Conference games with toughness, fans can expect minor improvement but anything beyond that is certainly wishful thinking. 

At the end of the day, a tougher schedule should provide substantial experience and exposure for a team that in its second year of Division 1-A ball. 

Patience is the key quality that the fans should possess in order to keep his or her sanity. Regardless of the teams 2007 record, it is evident that both athletic director Pete Garcia and coach Cristobal are committed to winning. 

2006 was certainly not memorable, and the only way to flush out that negativity is a step in the right direction in 2007. With that being said, fans should expect minor improvements at best and can only hope that the basic necessities for success are at least established. 

If not, as the clichéd saying goes, "there's always next year."

&nbsp;
Game 1: Aug 31 at Middle Tennessee St. Blue Raiders L (6 - 7) 

Giving a glimpse of things to come, the Golden Panthers' defense held strong for much of the game. Future Baltimore Ravens 3rd round draft choice, linebacker Antwaan Barnes, led the team with 4 sacks as the Raiders scored just one touchdown, but the offense failed to provide support, scoring just one touchdown and eventually losing the game due to a missed PAT by K Chris Patullo.

Game 2: Sep 09 at South Florida Bulls L (20 - 21) 

Despite holding a 20-7 lead at the half, Patullo missed another PAT and senior Julian Reams fumbled the ball with 3 minutes left in the game. Bulls senior quarterback Matt Grothe took advantage, tossing the game-winning 29-yard touchdown with 2:33 left in the game. 

Game 3: Sep 16 Bowling Green Falcons L (28 - 33) 

In the first home game of the season, the Panthers looked to overcome their heartbreaking losses in the first 2 games and give the hometown crowd something to cheer about.

Unfortunately, the usually steady defense surrendered 23 points in the first half, and the game ended on quarterback Josh Padrick's intercepted Hail Mary as time expired. 

Game 4: Sep 23 @ Maryland Terrapins L (10 - 14) 

Taking on the heavily favored Terrapins, the Panthers defense again valiantly fought a battle the offense could not win as the Golden Panthers lost another game on an interception in the end zone as time expired. 

Game 5: Sep 30 Arkansas State Indians L (6 - 31) 

Despite the defense allowing just 2 scores in the first half, the offense failed to score any points, and by the time they did put points on the board, the deficit was already an insurmountable 21 points.

Game 6: Oct 07 @ North Texas Mean Green L (22 - 25) 

This was a game where neither team seemed to want to grab victory. The Golden Panthers eventually lost in the 7th overtime, tying an NCAA record for longest game. On the way to seven overtimes, the teams missed eight field goals combined.

Game 7: Oct 14 @ Miami (Fla) Hurricanes L (0 - 35) 

Looking to make a statement against their cross-town rivals, the Golden Panthers came out of the gates fighting and clawing against the Hurricanes, both figuratively, and then in the 3rd quarter, literally. The teams engaged in an ugly scuffle involving most players from both teams.

Up to the time of the fight, the defense, however, had managed to hold the Hurricane's high powered offense to only 14 points, and just a single touchdown in the first half.

Game 8: Oct 28 @ Alabama Crimson Tide L (3 - 38) 

Missing nine starters and 18 players total following ejections from the previous game's fight, the Golden Panthers managed to stay in the game against the heavily favored Crimson Tide, trailing only 10-3 at halftime. However, the loss of almost a third of the roster was too much, and they ended up allowing 38 unanswered points.

Game 9: Nov 11 Louisiana-Monroe Indians L (0 - 35) 

Following a 38-3 drubbing in the previous week, the Golden Panthers showed another listless performance on both sides of the ball, suffering their first ever home shutout against their conference rivals, the Indians. 

Game 10: Nov 18 Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns L (7 - 17) 

Looking to salvage a lost season by winning their homecoming game, the Golden Panthers took an early seven point lead on Padrick's 1-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter. However, the offense failed to do much else in the game, and the Cajuns scored 17 unanswered points to hand FIU its 10th loss of the season.

Game 11: Nov 25 @ Florida Atlantic Golden Owls L (0 - 31) 

Coming off their 1st ever victory in the Shula Bowl vs. the rival Owls in 2005, the Panthers turned in their 4th straight disappointing performance failing to reach the end zone or convert a field goal while. The Golden Panthers allowed the Owls to move the ball at will as they racked up 361 yards and four touchdowns.

Game 12:  Dec 02 Troy State Trojans L(13 - 26) 

In the final game of the season and the final game of Coach Don Strock's Golden Panther career, the offense struggled again, gaining only 245 total yards allowing the Trojans to move on the a conference title and a bowl bid.

Headline: New coach sets out to change direction of program
Author: Chris Cabral / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A former collegiate offensive lineman imposes his presence during the FIU spring football practices. He walks on the sidelines and demonstrates practice maneuvers. This man who hopes to make his presence felt is FIU football new head coach, Mario Cristobal. 

He has taken the helm of the FIU football program and would be body slamming opponents if he had another occupation.

"I'd be a professional wrestler. I never got a shot at Andre the Giant and I think if I had my druthers, I'd go to Madison Square Garden and you know, take him for the world heavy weight title," said Cristobal.

His energy during practices coupled by his physical stature command his team's respect. Following a winless 2006 season and a nationally televised brawl with UM, the FIU football program felt it needed a change in leadership.

"The timing is right. This place is exactly where I need to be," Cristobal said.

Cristobal has seen teams rise from bitter defeats and periods of failure and vault to the top of college football. He began his coaching career at UM in 1998 when he was 28-years old; at a time when the school had just suffered it's worst record in 19 years and was still enduring the loss of several scholarships. 

He was part of a coaching staff that helped that program rebound and re-establish itself as one the nations top programs. He went on to become an assistant coach at Rutgers, at a time when the school's football team was not considered successful.

 "At Rutgers you'd pick up a paper and it'd say 'Rutgers shouldn't be playing football' or 'how could they lose so poorly?' Cristobal recalls. Today, Rutgers ranks No. 16 in the preseason AP poll and finished ranked No. 16 in the BCS standings last year.

So it's no surprise that athletic director, Pete Garcia, entrusted the ailing football program to Cristobal. He has gone from being an aspiring NFL player to being the head coach of a Division 1-A school in the span of only nine years. For the first time in his life, at the age of 37, he is the leader of a football team at any level.

"While the young coach may have less than a decade of coaching experience, he is still older than head coach Greg Schiano was when he took over the Rutgers program, and he too had only nine years of experience coaching in the college ranks. Therefore, he would not be the first head coach under 40 to turn a struggling program around. 

In fact, as Cristobal is eager to make clear, youth has its advantages. Unlike older coaches, Cristobal still possesses the physical skills to actually get on the field and show his players what he wants them to do

"I'm young enough to still demonstrate drills out here on the football field," he said. 

Cristobal is very different from many loud, authoritarian coaches, gridiron tyrants who make up for their diminutive stature by being loud and mean. 

Alex Mirabal, FIU tight ends coach and former high school teammate of Cristobal says the Coach prefers to be "demanding, not demeaning...he treats his players like men and expects them to act like men."

Cristobal is careful to harness his energy carefully, and tries to refrain from yelling at players just for the sake of being feared. 

"You'll notice their always a lot of energy out here, and it's all geared toward teaching and development there is a big difference between just being noise, and being intense and being a teacher and helping guys develop."

Cristobal has another mission as the new head coach. "I think that more than anything else, as a coach you change lives. You affect people. It's the only organized sport that allows you to really affect people in terms of discipline in terms of helping them become better players, better brothers, better husbands, better teammates, better members of society and the community." 

His view of the position of head coach is colored by his own past. When asked which coaches have influenced him, he rattles off some of the big name coaches he has worked with, Greg Schiano of Rutgers. Butch Davis of UM he then lingers on and mentions a less heralded name. 

"Dennis Lovell, my high school coach. Let me tell you what, that guy is a guy that changed my life completely. He coached at my school. My parents were always so busy working just trying to make ends meet, and my coach he's the one that changed my life. So, I'm forever in debt to him." 

Cristobal believes he can change the lives of his players and the team's misfortunes-dramatically. 

"We are going to build something special in time and the only variable I repeat, is time, this will be a championship program."

Headline: GOLDEN PANTHER 2007 STRATEGY GUIDE: OFFENSE
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The key to this season will be keeping composure from both the players and coaching staff as they march through the first six games of the schedule. Should the Panthers get through those games relatively unscathed, the team has a realistic chance to compete for the conference and carry momentum through to the next season, where nearly every starting position on the field will be returning.

With that said, here is an outlook on what to expect from each position on the field.



Quarterback:
Questions have swirled around over who will solidify the quarterback position since the beginning of training camp.

Sophomore Paul McCall is the lone contender with a taste of action, having gone 7-of-18 in limited appearances against Alabama, Miami, Middle Tennessee, FAU and Troy. An intelligent player with a decent arm, his experience with the team may factor into a decision, although coach Cristobal has repeatedly stressed it will be the performance of the players on the field this year that determines the starter.

The competition is close with two capable freshmen, Colt Anderson and Darold Hughes, both proven leaders having taken their team to the state championships at their respective high schools.

Much intrigue and excitement, however, comes in the form of red-shirt freshmen Wayne Younger, having come off a breakout performance in last year's spring game and who many consider to be the front runner for the job along with Anderson. Demonstrating the athletic ability to create plays not only with his arm but his feet as well, it may be exactly what the team needs in their new spread offense while the offensive line finds its cohesion as the season progresses. 





Running Backs: 
What may have been an area of potential at the beginning of last year has manifested itself with the growing experience and maturity of the dual threat that is juniors Julian Reams and A'mod Ned. 

Ned will be looking for performances like that of last years game against Bowling Green that gave him 225 yards and an 80-yard touchdown run. 

The pair of backs will play a large role in the success of the new pass oriented offense, seeing as to how they must convince the competition to respect the run. "You have to run the ball to pass the ball," said offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach James Coley. "It's as simple as that."

Relief will come from sophomores Daunte Owens and James Jones, while the way will be paved by John Ellis, who also carried for an efficient 5.3 yards per carry last year.

"We will be looking for a four-headed monster," said coach Cristobal. "There are decisions to be made, but it's a good problem to have."

With the inexperienced quarterbacks, the rest of the backfield may have to carry much of the load of the offense to keep the Golden Panthers in contention.





Offensive Line/Tight Ends:
The offensive line will be combining youth with experience and making a number of changes as they look to become one as a unit. Tackle Andy Leavine will assume his normal position at left tackle, but former center Xavier Shannon will be seeing extended reps at right tackle as freshman Brad Serini will look to cement himself as the snapper. Leavine will be joined on the left side by Alex Szima, a sophomore guard weighing in at a bulky 320 pounds. Manning the right guard will be Joe Alajajian, who has made quite an impression at camp, while veteran Dustin Gibson will also being seeing multiple spots along the line.

Tight end is a source of excitement for the team, as junior Moses Hinton returns froma broken foot injury and many are anxious to see whether he lives up to the potential he demonstrated his first year. Hinton is a huge target and solid receiver, which should give the team a go-to option that may not have been there in past years.





Wide Receivers:
While there are no standout receivers, the position runs deep and provides a variety of options for the quarterback. Although a lack of size from experienced players may hurt the offense, the team will need the game-breaking ability of speedster sophomores Ashlyn Parker and Jeremy Dickens.

Red shirt sophomore Lloyd Moss and Greg Ellison may be able to fill the need for a possession receiver, although they may be greeted with a quick seasoning from the Nittany Lions.

Making noise at camp is Torrelt Solomon, a blazer who is becoming a top option for all the quarterbacks and will be likely to see starting time if the team continues the experiment of Parker and Dickens in the secondary.

&nbsp;
The key to this season will be keeping composure from both the players and coaching staff as they march through the first six games of the schedule. Should the Panthers get through those games relatively unscathed, the team has a realistic chance to compete for the conference and carry momentum through to the next season, where nearly every starting position on the field will be returning.

With that said, here is an outlook on what to expect from each position on the field.



Defensive Line:
The defensive line was the muscle of the team last year and, along with the secondary, is the brightest spot for this squad. The front four are both talented and deep with returning starters Jarvis Penerton, Roland Clarke and Reginald Jones anchoring the line of scrimmage along with junior Jonathan Betancourt.

Jones has locked down a position at one end while Penerton will be rotating between tackle and guard with sophomore Artis Warthen also in the mix.

Keep an eye on young Curtis Bryant out of South Miami, originally intent on North Carolina State before committing to FIU.

All in all, the defensive line should and in all likelihood will live up to the expectations set last year, all while having to possibly carry a young linebacking corps behind them.



Linebackers:
Aside from quarterback, the linebacker spot is the biggest question mark on the field after losing three critical components last year thanks to eligibility. That doesn't mean the upside isn't there with returning sophomore Scott Bryant looking to create havoc for both the running and passing game in the backfield with his speed. 

Tyler Clawson looks to compete with Mannie Wellington, who is coming off an injury, for the middle linebacker spot. Another quick player, he will need to quickly fill in the holes left by last year's Keyonvis Bouie. Ryan Martinez looks to start opposite of Scott Bryant, although we may see more time out of 225 pound sophomore Michael Dominguez in an effort to add size to the position.



Secondary:
Lionell Singleton, despite nursing an injury for most of camp, follows the mold of Adam "Pac-man" Jones (at least with his performance on the field and not off it) and a certain corner out of FSU with the last name Sanders. Quite a company to keep, but coach Phillip Galliano sees the parallels.

"Not only could [Singleton] play at Rutgers, but any where in the country as well." 

The team will certainly need his game-breaking abilities, but he will have help from one of the deepest units on the team. Junior Robert Mitchell brings polish and experience to the other side of the field, and will certainly see a lot of action his opposite of Singleton. 

Senior Cory Fleming patrols at free safety, while Brandon Ellison will man at the strong safety position. 



Special Teams:
The special teams' antics are infamous, from missed extra points to a certain brawl. The kicking situation is particularly an issue, as neither Dustin Rivest nor John Paul Fraites has demonstrated the skills or composure necessary for the position. 

Even head coach Cristobal admits he has no time frame for announcing the starter, but the team could be on the losing end of some games should they not find an adequate performer.

Singleton remains the marquee return man, while Jeremy Dickens has game-changing abilities of his own. 

Towards the end of the season, the Panthers will be in some close matches and it will fall on the special teams' shoulders to be the difference.

Even if the team loses all their games this season, this year can't be any worse than last.

Headline: SORORITY VS. STUDY: At orientation, Greek life trumps higher learning
Author: Ana Paola Capaldo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Walking through the initiation of the Honors College freshman orientation, I could group my fellow Honors College students into two categories: the cynical ones, weary of having made the choice of attending their "safety" school and those fresh-faced, excited out-of-towners.

As we were herded into the ballroom by clusters of enthusiastic and borderline fervent "Panther guides," I looked forward to a myriad of presentations, lectures, and all sorts of educationally enriching, albeit monotonous, activities that would show me just what FIU was really about. All in all, I expected a well-rounded depiction of FIU as a whole.

I was a slightly uncharacteristic high school student. While everyone was wrapped up in prom and who would win the rigged homecoming queen elections, I had hardly looked up from my books long enough to notice. 

And so, I chose the Honors College for its emphasis on exceptional academia and high standards. I figured it would encompass all of the great things about a regular school, but with more access to the specialized learning and higher standards.

Given this, I was put off by a big chunk of this orientation, which insisted on promoting, and almost proselytizing, us potential neophytes into joining their respective Greek organizations. Everyone, from fellow students to members of different councils - even professors - seemed bent on dragging us into their "non-exclusive" frats. 

These supporters of organized "brotherhoods" ranged from those promoting the event, like members of SGA, and other council members. Even some professors infiltrated the groups of followers. 

All in all, the awe among incoming freshman was apparent; here were the epitome of college perfection, frat brothers and sorority sisters, practically pleading for us to join their cause.

Up to now, I didn't know FIU was such a breeding ground for these groups - at least not any more than any other university. But almost a third of the day's activities were spent on this ever-present and somewhat glamorized aspect of college life. 

In stark contrast, the topic of honors societies, philanthropic groups and other academic organizations were mentioned, fleetingly, at best.

After a "Freshman Experience" like that, any student new to FIU could very well feel that much of campus life revolves around Greek life. 

But after much inquiry, I came to find other things to enrich my stay here at FIU. Only through searching around in GC hallways did I notice The Beacon's office and decided to come in for an application. I found a few flyers for a production by a theater production group called "Distinguished Monkey" lying around on the floor, in stark contrast to the "rush" banners plastered on every wall.  

This was the FIU I was looking for, a forum for the arts, free expression, and a competitive institution of higher learning. Only, no one really bothered to talk about this at orientation, or even around campus.

It's not to say that these Greek organizations are not thoroughly enriching and often conducive to very great qualities in the members they recruit and foster, as their platforms insist, but is there not more to college life? 

Which leaves me with the following questions: 

What reputation is our school trying to make for itself? 

What are the real priorities of a university? 

To me, the answer may just be academic integrity, honor, progressive and positive change, and philanthropic endeavors. And somewhere in there, of course, are and will continue to be, student societies.

Headline: Letter to the Editor #1: Registration frustrates senior
Author: Dorian Perez / Senior / International Relations
&nbsp;
I am outraged at the layers of bureaucracy and inefficiency at FIU. 

I am a senior who is three credits shy of graduating. I could not get into my one course this fall 2007 because they have let freshmen and others below me fill up the one class I need to finish my degree. 

Why do seniors not have priority at this school? 

I have done the usual FIU dance, which anyone familiar with the bureaucracy at FIU knows: call and e-mail professors, get passed off to a faceless voice at the registrar's office, visit the school and assorted offices and keep getting passed off to the tune of "I'm sorry, I can't do anything about it," rinse and repeat. No one takes responsibility! 

President Truman had a sign on his desk that read "The buck stops here." Apparently, no one at FIU believes in this. 

I am writing this letter to blast the head of registration (whoever it is, you can't even get a link to this person online) and anyone else involved with the setup of this tragedy called FIU bureaucracy. 

I want to get out of school, I want to graduate and FIU is not helping me! 

Why not take care of the ones who have toiled here at this school for so long? Take care of me, so that later on down the road I can come back and take care of FIU with financial contributions. 

Apparently FIU is too shortsighted for this. 

Give seniors priority in the registration process!

Headline: Letter to the Editor #2: Coke kills
Author: Pablo Avendano / Senior / Political Science
&nbsp;
The July 16 letter to the editor, "Coca-Cola not responsible for conduct in Colombia," which takes spin directly from a Coca-Cola website design to counter the claims of the "professional activists," is riddled with lies, half-truths and distortions which Coca-Cola seems all too comfortable repeating incessantly - perhaps with the hopes that if they tell these lies often enough they may just hoodwink us all. 

For starters, everyone who has worked on this campaign on our campus, and on campuses around the globe that have fought to kick Coke out of their schools, have been students and members of the community, not like Ciarlante asserts with such a low blow, "professional activists." It's interesting that Coca-Cola states to be so concerned with dispelling the facts about their criminal behavior, but refused to participate in a public forum to be held at FIU last spring. The magical 31 percent of Coca-Cola workers that are unionized is an often-repeated fabrication. They refused to say how many workers they actually have - including those working in their subsidiaries and that are subcontracted - which Coke often conveniently excludes from their figures- and what union they belong to. The judicial process in Colombia is in shambles, but of course, that doesn't stop Coke from citing a ruling coming from such a discredited institution. The lawsuit in the United States was dismissed because of lack of jurisdiction and not the content of the claim, and there are some serious doubts as to Judge Martinez's impartiality when he has some substantive connections to Coca-Cola. 

If Coca-Cola were serious about addressing our concerns and allegations, they would have submitted to an independent, third-party investigation years ago. Unless they have something to hide.

Headline: Editorial: Beacon's goals for university
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Over the past school year, Florida International University has seen big changes: Classes switched to a M-W-F schedule and the College of Law got its accreditation. A $20 million donor showed up and vanished; an anonymous $5 million donor was found. Some  of these events have changed FIU for the better, some have changed it for the worse.

A new school year starts this week and with it will come a new set of changes. So that FIU comes one step closer to becoming a better school over the couse of this new school year, these are some of things The Beacon staff would like to see happen:

1. New, bigger donations for the School of Medicine. And hopefully, they'll come with a name attached.

So FIU President Modesto A. Maidique blew it last year when he lost a $20 million donation - plus another $20 million in matching state funds - when he quarrelled with donor and then-Board of Trustees member Herbert Wertheim, prompting him to withdraw his donation which he had already agreed to.

And he did half-redeem himself by bagging a smaller, $5 million donation from an anonymous donor.

In the end, though, the School of Medicine is still $30 million short of what it had before the Maidique-Wertheim dispute.

Maidique has always been quick to say that raising funds is one of his strongest skills as University president. To live up to that  claim, he needs to find donor willing to buy naming rights for the School of Medicine, and pronto.

2. "Bracing for hard financial times" better not mean suffering academic standards. Already, Maidique said in a July 13 press release that a shortage of funding in a lean Florida budget year means FIU may need to turn away qualified students.

And administration officials are busy cutting the far off the University's budget for the year.

Let's hope academic standards don't get cut along with the fat. Trimming the budget should  not mean reduced course offerings, crowded classrooms, underpaid faculty or understaffed student services. There's other places to cut, namely:

3. Poke a hole in bloated administrative salaries, starting with Maidique himself. Earlier this year, Florida Atlantic University President Frank Brogan announced his first step in responding to this year's budget shorfall would be by giving  his annual raise back to his university. 

True leadership is by example, and it's time Maidique got the message. Taking a pay cut would be a great way to start slicing away at FIU's disproportionately large administrative salaries.

Need proof that University's administrators are overpaid? According to an April 2007 study by FIU's Research Institute on Social and Economic Policy, money for administrative salaries increased by over 20 percent between 2002 and 2006. During the same period of time, the money it devotes to faculty salaries dropped by 10 percent and tuition increased about 30 percent. 

Under this formula, administrator win while students and faculty lose big time. That's unacceptable, lean budget year or not.

4. A winning strategy for FIU's football team:

First, win a game or two. Second, avoid embarrassing media spectacles by picking fights with other teams. Last, graduate more players to avoid losing NCAA scholarship.

Is that too much to ask of a team that's getting a new stadium?
