Headline: BBC construction near completion after two years
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Construction at the Biscayne Bay Campus has been in the works for about two years. 

When construction is finished, it will offer more space and comfort with new eating facilities as well as a recreation center, new classrooms and a marine biology building.

"There are two parts that are underway in WUC," said Gregory Olson, senior director of  Student Affairs. "One is site work that involves all the underground sewer lines and border lines around the university. We are also in the process of digging test piles under the foundation, which takes about 28 days to cure, and then begin erecting the building."

Olson looks forward to the opening of the new buildings tentatively set to open February 2007.

Students are anticipating the changes as well. 

"The new gym will definitely be a really nice improvement to have, especially for those of us that live on campus, because the current gym is so small and often overly crowded," said freshman Shirin Madzhidova. 

Vice-Provost Raul Moncarz said it would be a matter of time before creating a meal plan for BBC students with the Fresh Food company, which is available to students at University Park. 

"It's mostly a question of numbers," Moncarz said. "But if housing continues to fill up and enrollment rises, a student meal plan is definitely something we are considering for the future."

Complaints from students about classroom sizes are also something the administration will address in the near future when the cafeteria is moved from its current location. 

The current cafeteria would be replaced by larger classrooms that would provide a more spacious and comfortable environment for students to learn, according to James Wassenaar, executive director of student affairs operations and auxiliary services who oversees construction projects that involves student services.

"Work is progressing, the food court will provide needed food service capabilities and a better environment overall as well as a water front view on the east side of the building," Wassenaar said. "It will also be more easily accessed for students and faculty coming from Academic I or [Academic] II."  

ium is a project to be honored in a ceremony at the end of this month though complications in construction has still pushed back the date.

The marine biology program has 70 percent of its faculty for the fall and is looking to hire more as the semester begins. It will be known as Academic III, hopefully announcing the future of an Academic 4 Moncarz said.

Currently, the WUC and marine biology construction will be costing the school approximately $13 million dollars in funds, according to Moncarz

Most of the funds for these budgets are proposed as projects and then approved by the state legislature.

There are, however, other constructions being funded by private and open sources sympathetic to the cause.

The School of Hospitality and Management also plans to extend its dining room through private funds, said Moncarz. The school has also recently acquired a new electronic room, which was donated in part by the Marriott, a hotel chain.

Headline: Students concerned with religion
Author: Jennifer Martinez / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
WASHINGTON - A majority of U.S. college students say religion is important in their lives and that they're concerned about the country's moral direction, a finding that could influence the way they vote in upcoming elections, according to a Harvard University Institute of Politics poll that was released Tuesday.

In a telephone survey of 1,200 American college students, 7 out of 10 said religion was somewhat or very important in their lives, and 1 in 4 said they'd become more spiritual since entering college.

Fifty-four percent said they were concerned about the moral direction of the country.

Students who were surveyed said abortion policy, stem cell research and gay marriage provoked questions of morality. 

In a finding that surprised the institute, 50 percent said the U.S. government's response to Hurricane Katrina raised questions of morality.

Sixty-two percent of students who identified themselves as Republicans said religion was losing its influence on American society, while 54 percent of Democrats said it was increasing its influence. 

Most agreed, however, that a candidate's religion wouldn't affect how they voted.

Jeanne Shaheen, the director of the Institute of Politics, said in a statement that the findings showed that "religion and morality are critical to how students think about politics and form opinions on political issues."

"Students have gone from the `me' generation, Generation X, to the `we' generation," Shaheen said. 

The poll results make it hard to define college students as liberal or conservative, based on the traditional definitions of those political views, the institute found. 

While 44 percent of the student population could be considered traditional liberals and 16 percent traditional conservatives, 25 percent could be considered religious centrists and 13 percent fall into the secular centrist category. 

American college students could play a major role in upcoming elections. Eighteen- to 24-year-olds cast 11.6 million votes in the 2004 presidential election, 3 million more than in 2000, according to the institute.

"We do care, we are involved and we do vote," said Caitlin Monahan, 20, a Harvard government major who helped formulate the poll questions and collect data for the survey. 

The institute also found that:

College students' opinions about potential 2008 presidential candidates Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., and John McCain, R-Ariz., are split. Forty percent said they'd vote for Clinton, and another 40 percent favored McCain. 

The remaining 20 percent said they were unsure which candidate they liked best.

Only one-third approved of the job President Bush was doing, while 59 percent disapproved. 

Eight percent were unsure.

59 percent said they thought the country was on the "wrong track," 30 percent said it was on the right track and 12 percent said they didn't know.

Seventy-two percent said the United Nations, not the U.S., should lead in international crises and resolve conflicts. 

Sixty-six percent said the U.S. should deploy troops in cases of genocide or ethnic cleansing.

Sixty percent said the U.S. should begin to withdraw troops from Iraq.

Headline: University on alert after sexual predator escapes
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
Carlos Garay, a 34-year-old, was arrested on sexual battery and burglary warrants on April 13, but managed to drive off in the police car in which he was being held, handcuffed and armed. 

According to University Public Safety Lieutenant Frank J. Tomassini, Garay was placed in the back of a police car, when he managed to climb over the front seat and drive handcuffed, while the police officer stepped out of the car.

The car lacked the cage that separates the front and back seats of the police car. In the car was a handgun, a stun gun and handcuffs. 

Garay was thought to be in the west Miami-Dade area, which led the police to secure University Park with police and helicopters circling the campus.

"There is no positive indication he came on campus but we don't know," Tomassini said.

Tomassini wants students to be aware of how dangerous Garay is and warns students to be careful.

"Be very cautious. We are shorthanded," Tomassini said. "We are very limited and would love to have an officer in the dorms but can't."

This case falls under Miami-Dade police department jurisdiction but Public Safety and Sweetwater police helped search and secure the west Miami-Dade area. 

This also caused of the State of Student Address to be postponed until April 19 in the Graham Center Pit at noon.

"The State of the Student Address was postponed because [Garay] was on the loose and we were advised to keep doors closed," said Alex Prado, Student Government Association president.

Garay is accused of two rapes (connected by DNA matches) that occurred between September and December 2005. 

According to The Miami Herald, investigators think that Garay is responsible for break-ins and sexual assaults in the Hammocks and Midwest districts.

Police said the suspect entered unlocked doors and windows between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., fondling women or masturbating while they slept, reported the Miami Herald. 

As of early April 14 Garay was still on the loose.

Headline: Student media leaders elected
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
In a unanimous decision, the University Media Board elected C. Joel Marino as The Beacon's new editor in chief and rehired WRGP general manager Brenann Forsythe April 13.

Marino was chosen over Leoncio Alvarez while Forsythe ran unopposed.

The Media Board, consists of School of Journalism and Mass Communication Dean Lillian Kopenhaver and faculty members of SJMC as well as other South Florida professionals with experience in media and media law. 

Marino will replace Harry Coleman, who has been editor in chief since April 2005. There is a possibility Coleman will remain editor through August.

"Since I'm going to be working in an internship during the summer I won't be around for the paper's production Summer B, Marino said. "However, I will try my best to remain involved with the paper as best as I can from Ft. Myers, which is where I will be working." 

Marino has worked at The Beacon since 2003.

"The Media Board hired a passionate journalist in Mr. Marino. He will continue an upward spiral that The Beacon is currently in," said Robert Jaross, director of student media.

Forsythe has worked at the radio station for almost two years.

"I am really excited that the Media Board chose me again for a second term," Forsythe said. "My first order of business is to continue working toward getting our translator for University Park on air."

Jaross agreed.

"Brennan is committed to turning WRGP into a medium rather than a place to spin music. I look forward to being able to tune into WRGP and hear Mr. Forsythe and his staff on the airwaves next year."

Headline: South Dakota lawmakers toying with victims' rights
Author: Jamie Blanco / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A 15 year-old girl sits in a hospital bed in South Dakota. 

She's been molested by her uncle for years, then finally was beaten and raped. She lies listless in her hospital bed feeling dirty, used and hurt. She's not in bed because of the beating that happened weeks before. She's lying there because doctors say she's pregnant with her tormentor's child. 

 The reasons to keep the child are few. The risk of disease and complications in the baby and the young mother are great. Her youth and feeling of resentment would prevent her from being able to care for a child, and to go through with the pregnancy with her rapists child would leave her psychologically scarred for life. She fears ridicule and being labeled a tramp for attacks over which she had no control. She wants to return to school and be a normal kid. 

 It is early in the pregnancy and she wants an abortion. 

But starting July 1 in her state, the doctor will walk into the room, look the young girl in the eye and tell her she no longer has the right to make that choice. 

 She'll be told that the lawmakers of South Dakota, proudly upholding certain morals, strive to save lives. Not her life, of course, but the one inside her uterus, which is now protected property of the state. That is, until it's born, in which case these same lawmakers haven't proposed any plans to offer aid to the girl or her unwanted child. 

And if lawmakers get their way, girls like this won't be able to go to any other state to have an abortion either. 

South Dakota has passed the most sweeping, restrictive bans on abortion in the nation, for the singular purpose of challenging Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court case that defined reproductive rights and declared that no state shall place "an un-due burden" on a woman seeking an abortion. 

When it comes to challenging the constitutionality of a law, South Dakota has the right idea, hoping to make it to the Supreme Court. I understand it's a democratic process. But to go so far as to deny the procedure even to the victims of rape and incest is callous and wrong. 

At some point this stops being a fight for life and becomes a game of ego. 

Republican Representative Roger W. Hunt is delighted that the "special circumstances" were also banned, he told The Washington Post in February, because they could have "diluted the bill and it's impact on the national scene." 

Oh yes, I think it's making an impact. It's sending a negative message to women across the nation that they are less valued citizens. 

So what if these girls are first victimized by a brutal attacker, and then by the state. So what if the law would eliminate a woman's rights as an individual during pregnancy. So what if forcing a woman to go through with an unwanted pregnancy increases all sorts of risks on mother and child, including post-partum depression, child neglect, child abuse and even death. 

Forcing every unwanted birth would flood an already overwhelmed Child Services system, with more and more children falling through the cracks. 

Imagine forcing thousands of children to be born to unfit or unwilling parents daily. 

Ironically many pro-life advocates don't support the social programs necessary to deal with the influx of unwanted children into the child services system or to help families struggling with finances. 

I think these lawmakers are the ones not thinking about the consequences of their actions. 

If politcians really want to save what lives they can, they need smarter solutions. Put an end to partial birth and late term abortions, offer counselors for adoptive services at abortion clinics so all the options are well represented, set a cut off time, invest in preventative safe sex education; all are reasonable measures. 

To strip a woman of her rights over her own body, is not reasonable. 

As an individual I despise the idea of abortion. It's something I would never do, but that's my choice over my body! 

I have no right to make that choice for any other person, and neither does anyone else.

Headline: Moussaoui should not receive the death penalty
Author: Christopher Necuze / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
If I were ever to put myself in the position of one of the jury members in the case against Zacarias Moussaoui, a Sept. 11 conspirator, the only thing going through my mind in the deliberation room would be how to cause this man as much pain as possible. 

When asked by prosecutor Rob Spencer about Sept. 11, Moussaoui swiftly responded "No regret, no remorse. I just wish it had happened on the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th and 17 …"

"You wake up every day to destroy the United States, don't you?" asked Spencer.

"To the best of my ability." answered an increasingly smug and resolute Moussaoui.

When asked whether or not he wants to stay alive to kill Americans, he responded "anytime, anywhere."

During his trial, Moussaoui detailed his hatred for the United States. He also ridiculed survivor's of the attacks, calling them pathetic  and saying that he was disgusted by the fact that they had not died.

"So you would be happy to see 9/11 again?" Spencer asked.

"Everyday," Moussaoui responded.  

This is a man who, although he denies it, wants to die by the hand of the United States. I believe it is his mission to get a home, albeit a temporary one, on death row - but the only reason he wants it is to achieve martyrdom. 

If what Moussaoui wants to do is die, then let him rot in solitary confinement for the rest of his life as the shamed and failed terrorist he is.

As jurors sat transfixed by the voice recorder data from Flight 93 - in which a group of Muslim extremists were thwarted in their attempts to hijack a plane by the passengers onboard - all Moussaoui could manage to do was smile, giggle and sit slumped in his courtroom chair, apathetic to the often wrenching recordings and various testimonies from some of the victims' families.

This man's life is unimportant to me. I care as much about his life as I do about the life of Osama Bin Laden or any other member of the Al Qaeda terrorist network. 

I am more worried about the message his death would send to the world. I don't want it to seem like the United States is merely acting out of pure vengeance and hatred. 

If we kill this man, he will have accomplished his mission; his place in history as a martyr will be consolidated. 

Killing him would only secure in the minds of our enemies that the United States is as evil as they say and that their war, or jihad as they so lovingly call it, is justified. 

The United States has been granted the opportunity to make a huge statement. I am not concerned the well-being of this man, as he has admitted to being involved in the Sept. 11 plot and said that he would do it again if given the opportunity. 

Jurors in this case need to seriously consider what their sentence recommendation to the judge means, not just for Moussaoui, but for the United States itself, because the decision is about so much more than life and death. 

Moussaoui needs to be punished for his actions, but whatever the punishment may be, it should not glorify his image in the least. Killing this man would make him a martyr in the eyes of his associates and deify him as the man who willingly died at the hands of the superpower.

To kill him would be to catapult a man with nothing but hatred in his heart to stardom; something which the United States simply cannot do. 

Lock him up and throw away the key. Let him suffer like the vile waste of life that he is.

Subheadline: Locals must be more involved with immigration issues
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Six workers at a seafood restaurant in Houston were fired last week after leaving their jobs to attend a pro-immigration march, according to a South Florida Sun-Sentinel report.

Twenty-one immigrant meat cutters in Detroit also lost their jobs after attending a similar rally, while closer to home, students at a Tampa high school were suspended for skipping class in order to protest at a nearby demonstration.

Even though organizers of the mass rallies sweeping the nation have discouraged participants from leaving work or school to attend the marches, these are just a few examples of the zeal felt by the immigrant community following the Senate's failure to reach a compromise on a bill that would legalize a majority of illegal immigrants.

Despite the outcry taking place around the country, we find it surprising that many within Miami's immigrant community (whether here legally or otherwise) have not show as much passion for this issue as seen in other cities. 

Yes, there have been a few marches, and yes, public debates and media coverage of the bill's overall national effects have been heightened, but there hasn't been as much interest in the debate as would have been expected from such a predominantly immigrant metropolis.

Perhaps the Cuban and Haitian majorities feel that this is an issue to be tackled solely by the Mexican-American population. Yet Miami has a high population of people from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Colombia and Argentina.

Though a bill enforcing border security by making felons of those who enter the U.S. through unauthorized means passed by the House in December was originally targeted at the thousands who yearly cross the Mexican border, the bill's vague language would eventually make it possible to label all unauthorized immigrants as felons.

We believe that it is unfair for people to demand the instant rights many legal immigrants work for years to attain. However, we support those demonstrators who are protesting the criminal label that will be placed on the nation's current 11 million immigrants, most of whom are here living as low workers.

We urge students of immigrant backgrounds and those interested in immigrant rights to find a way to get involved in this debate. 

Though measures as strong as those mentioned above need not be taken, joining a peaceful rally on the weekend or writing letters to representatives would equally serve in spotlighting a situation that will eventually affect our city's economy, government, culture and way of life.

Headline: Freshman golfer talks success, Harry Potter
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Freshman sensation Susan Nam has made serious noise on the golf course this season. Nam hails from Seoul, Korea, a country that she said started featuring golf only six years ago.

It wasn't Korea that gave Nam her passion for the sport, however.

Coming over to the Western Hemisphere at 12 years-old so that her sister could play the piano, Nam was influenced by her uncle - a professional golf instructor - and from then on, her love for golf grew.

With her family's sudden move to Canada, Nam settled in Edmonton where she became a huge success on the golf course. 

By winning 14 of 25 junior events in 2004 and shooting an average of 75.6 per round, Nam became the third-ranked golfer in the Canadian Junior Girls Order of Merit and first in her province of Alberta.

That caught the eye of a FIU David Pezzino, golf head coach, as he brought her down to Miami.

In just her first year of collegiate competition, this freshman prodigy has amassed some great success. 

This past Fall semester she was the top finisher in three out of four tournaments and averaged a team score of 76.27 - good enough for eighth in the Sun Belt Conference.  

Her successes earned her SBC Golfer of the Month for February and attention from The Beacon, who caught up with Nam to find out more about the person underneath the talented amateur.  

Q: Growing up in Korea, what is one character trait your parents always instilled in you?

They always told me that I could do whatever I want in life and to make sure I enjoy it, but to always take responsibility for my actions. I make my choices, but I'm responsible for the decisions I make and I have to stand by them and deal with it.

Q: Who's one person you would love to play 18 holes with and where?

I would have to say Tiger Woods. He'd probably beat me pretty bad too. I guess if you're playing Tiger Woods it doesn't matter where you play, so I really don't care.

Q: Who is your biggest role model and why?

Annika Sorenstam has been a big influence in me just because she's a woman and she's been so successful. Surprisingly, she's had a lot of influence back home in Korea in making the game of golf spread.

Q: Your major is undecided right now, so what do you think you'd be doing with your life if you weren't playing golf?

I think I would be a doctor. I've always had a passion for medicine.

Q: What are some of your hobbies?

I love to read. Especially Harry Potter [books]; I am the biggest Harry Potter freak. I've read them all!

Q: How about television shows or movies?

I don't have time to watch TV ever. With school and all my classes and playing golf and reading Harry Potter, there's never anytime for TV.

Q: It is common knowledge that golfers are a very superstitious bunch, what are some superstitions you have when you play?

I never play with a ball numbered four. In Korea, the number four means death so I stay away from it at all times.

Q: What possessed you to come all the way down to Florida to attend school when you were living so much further North in Canada?

The cold weather did. I love tropical weather and I just couldn't stand living in Canada anymore. Everyday it was freezing!

Q: You were also recruited by Texas A&M, so why did you choose FIU instead?

Because of [head coach] Pezzino. He called me up and seemed very interested and I heard he is a great teacher so I knew it was a great opportunity for me.

Q: Finish this sentence: Most people would be surprised to know I …

Have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I can kick your butt!

Headline: Gooden's arrest another example of his troubled path
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The recent arrest of former rookie phenom Dwight Gooden reminded me of a line from one of my favorite movies, "A Bronx Tale."

"The saddest thing in life is wasted talent."

I wonder if the movie's screenplay writers were fans of the New York Mets, embittered by the former fireballer's rocky career decline in the midst of injuries and, more famously, drug problems.

Gooden, who was sentenced to one year in prison April 3 for violating his parole, almost literally blew people away during his rookie season in 1984. At only 19 years of age, he took the mound with enough skill and composure to intimidate even the most hardened veteran - his 97 MPH fastball and knee-buckling curveball might have helped also.

He carried over his Rookie of the Year success to the 1985 season, when his league-leading 24-4 record, 1.53 ERA and 268 strikeouts, making him the youngest recipient of the Cy Young Award.

If that wasn't enough of a testament to his meteoric rise to success in the big leagues, in 1986 he helped lead the Mets to a World Series title.

At this point, Gooden was on top of the world and already being discussed as one of the best pitchers of all time. 

I don't blame people for thinking that. After his outstanding first three seasons, it was a foregone conclusion that he would continue his dominance.

Then, even before Gooden, his teammates and Mets' fans got the taste of the World Series title out of their mouths, the shooting star was showing signs of dimming.

Prior to the 1987 season, Gooden tested positive for cocaine and rehab made him sit out the first two months of the season. 

From that point on, and thanks to injuries, his numbers - still above average - took a steady decline until 1992, when he became just another pitcher.

After testing positive twice for cocaine in 1994, suspending him for the entire 1995 season, it was official; the shooting star had burned out. 

He played until 2000 - even winning a World Series with the New York Yankees - but every time Gooden took the mound, he became the catalyst for the discussion of "what if?" - and still remains it to this day.

What if he had stayed on the right path? What if he had never taken cocaine? What if … ?

To this day, not only do people ask that, they also ask why.

Why did he take it? Why would he take it? Why didn't he stop taking it?

Maybe he got a little carried away in his World Series celebration with his teammates - the 1986 Mets were notoriously known for unabashed activity, especially cocaine use. Maybe the pressure of being considered one of the best pitchers of all time at the age of 20 was too much pressure to handle - he needed something to take the edge off.

It's easy to point the finger at Dwight and say he did it to himself, but addiction - especially with cocaine - is quite possibly the hardest thing for a human being to overcome. It happens to the best of us and Gooden is a perfect example.

I used to think it was his fault entirely. I mean, he was on pace to  possibly become the best pitcher of all time and not only did he mess up once, he messed up multiple times.

Addiction took over his desire for greatness.

As testament to that, Gooden not only turned himself in after using cocaine and violating his parole, he chose prison over extended parole. If Gooden had chosen extended parole, another positive test for cocaine would have landed him in jail for five years.

He knows what addiction has done to him and he knows what it could do to him.

Looking at the footage of Gooden being taken out of that courtroom in handcuffs was one of the final chapters of a life of wasted talent.

And that is truly a sad thing.

Headline: Capoeira class combines philosophy, agility, music
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"The first time you see someone engaging in it, you are captivated, amazed and at the same time curious to know what it is," said graduate student Cory Stewart, a linguistics major.

Stewart is referring to capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian martial art that was created and developed by African slaves in Brazil. He is one of the many students enrolled and actively involved in the University's capoeira class (PEM 1405). 

The art involves movement, music, as well as elements of practical philosophy.

"A person experiences the essence of capoeira by playing a physical game called jogo de capoeira [game of capoeira]," said Marcio Pizanelli, instructor of the capoeira program. "The game of capoeira involves strength, flexibility, and a lot of energy which is derived from the music of the Berimbau [a single string percussion bow-like Brazilian instrument]."

Capoeiristas usually gather in a circle and chant, clap and sing to the music provided by the musicians while the two people in the circle (the roda) play to the rhythm. The art is often considered a dance, a fight and a game all-in-one. 

"With capoeira, you are not only learning a martial art, but something that is part of the Brazilian culture," Pizanelli said. "The first time that students come in, they learn the ginga, the basic dance of capoeira - it's to setup the rhythm. After they learn the ginga and have coordination and balance, they learn how to do cartwheels, learn different kicks and moves we learn only in capoeira."

There are two main styles of capoeira - angola, which is characterized by slow movement and technique which is more in line with the customs and traditions of capoeira, and regional (pronounced 'heh-shon-al'), which was created in the 1920s in reaction to the street capoeira that emphasized the fighting aspects of the art. 

Regional is known for its fluid acrobatic play where strategy and coordination are key techniques. This is the type of capoeira that Pizanelli instructs.

Sophomore Linda Salgado, an accounting major, was introduced to capoeira by a friend who persuaded her to take the class along with him.

"I didn't know what it was. I thought it would be some type of martial art like karate or judo," Salgado said. "But when I came here, I realized that it was something completely different."

Stewart, who also attends capoeira classes outside the University, enrolled in Pizanelli's class to practice more and learn from a different instructor as well.

"There used to be times when I used to crunch up when people moved forward to attack me," he said. "What I learned most from capoeira is not to crunch up. I can now defend myself when the time calls for it."

Like Stewart, freshman Yasmin Blancas, a biochemistry major, agrees that capoeira taught her to defend herself in a proper way.

"I wanted to learn how to defend myself in an organized manner and not to fight like a crazy person," Blancas said. "I have learned things I never expected to be doing. The instructor is great, he's interesting, he makes the class fun and he doesn't make the students study things in a formulaic method." 

Pizanelli, who has taught the program at the University for more than a year, mentioned that anyone can take this class; no previous martial arts experience is needed. 

Students enrolled in the program are graded based on attendance, class participation, demonstrations, and a final exam in which they are quizzed on the history of capoeira as well as details of different kicks and other basic movements. 

At the end of the semester, students participate in a graduation ceremony called a batizado during which students receive a colored cord (a mark of a higher grade level). 

Graduates also receive nicknames, a capoeira tradition stemming from the 1960s when nicknames concealed the identities of practitioners of the then banned art. 

This semester's ceremony will take place at the Graham Center Pit April 22.

More information about the capoeira program can be found at www.capoeiraberimbau.com.

Nearly 3,000 people filled the Pharmed Arena to witness the mtvU Campus Invasion tour April 11. 

The concert, featuring headliner Motion City Soundtrack and opening acts Straylight Run and Hellogoodbye, lasted three hours and marked the tour's second appearance at the University in two years. 

Opening the show promptly at 7 p.m., Hellogoodbye went onstage dressed in costumes before starting its set. Ranging from fruits to animals, the band's costumes complemented its set's fun vibe. 

Hailing from Huntington Beach, Calif., the band's mix of upbeat pop and rock elements kept several fans in the crowd bouncing around and singing along. 

For an opening act, Hellogoodbye delivered an outstanding performance with ample stage presence and catchy tunes that set the tone for the rest of the performance. 

As lead singer and guitarist Forrest Kline crooned the lyrics, "My Bonnie lies over the ocean / My Bonnie lies over the sea," from the band's hit song "Bonnie Taylor Shakedown," it was difficult to hear his voice over the singing voices of the fans. 

The band finished their energetic half-hour set with fan-favorite "Shimmy Shimmy Quarter Turn" and left the stage to make room for Straylight Run.

Although Straylight Run performed a solid set, the crowd was not very welcoming to the band. Throughout the band's set, bottles and shoes were thrown at the group and caused singer and guitarist John Nolan to address the crowd's behavior. 

Playing songs from both their full-length self-titled debut and their extended play album, Straylight Run effectively mixed their set with slower-paced songs such as "Existentialism on Prom Night" as well as slightly more upbeat songs such as "Hands in the Sky." 

The band closed with the latter song, which made almost the entire crowd clap their hands to the beat and sing the chorus, "Big shot screaming put your hands in the sky." 

Despite the crowd's initial disrespect, the group's half-hour set of emo-rock provided a nice change of pace for the show before headliner Motion City Soundtrack performed. 

Motion City Soundtrack took the stage a few minutes after 9 p.m. and immediately caused people in the mosh pits to frantically dance in a way that appeared to cause injury. During the band's set, one attendee passed out and had to be taken out of the venue. 

Although MCS blazed through the better songs from both its records, its performance was somewhat lacking. 

As their set progressed, some songs started to blend together, making their one-hour set seem painfully longer. 

The band's set, however, was salvaged by a few highlights. Keyboardist Jesse Johnson, who appeared to be possessed, constantly danced and clapped around the stage as well as performing handstands and other random odd actions on stage.

 Also, more well-known songs such as the band's single "Everything is Alright" livened up an otherwise bland set. 

The concert was an overall fun experience, but certain details kept the show from really standing out. 

Aside from Motion City Soundtrack's somewhat bland set, the crowd was predominantly composed of middle-school and high-school aged kids, a surprising fact because the majority of tickets sold were bought by FIU students. 

"Most of the tickets sold were to FIU students, but a majority of the crowd that showed up were high-school kids. Their older siblings probably got them their tickets," said SPC Concerts Chair Jackie Gadea. 

Despite the scarce presence of FIU students, the concert was considered a success by SPC.

"We had over 2,700 [people] in attendance and MTV chose [University Park] as the featured campus on this tour. Looking back, [it] gave students something to do on a Tuesday night," Gadea said.
