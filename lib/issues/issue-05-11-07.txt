Headline: Golden Panther baseball releases schedule for 2006
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The baseball team, whose season was cut short in the quarterfinals of the Sun Belt Conference Tournament last season, released its schedule for the 2006 season Nov. 2.

The Golden Panthers will play 34 of their 58 games at home.

Head coach Danny Price, heading into his 27th year leading the team, has put together a tough schedule for his team, which includes games against teams with previous appearances in the College World Series. 

"Last season our out-of-conference schedule strength was in the top 18 percent," Price said. "This year, it's in the top percent."

Senior right-handed pitcher Frank Gonzalez believes this season's schedule is an improvement over last year's.

"[The schedule] is a lot better because we get a chance to test ourselves against top-10 teams,"  Gonzalez said.

The Golden Panthers will open up the season with arguably the toughest part of their schedule: A two-game home-and-away series against cross-town rivals Miami (Jan. 28-29) and a two-game home stand against Central Florida (Feb. 4-5).

The tough stretch continues with road series against Southern California (Feb. 10-12) ­- which has qualified for the NCAA Tournament 40 times and advanced to the College World Series 21 times - and Alabama (Feb. 24-26) - which has 16 appearances in the post season and advanced to the World Series five times.

"I'm looking forward to facing Southern California the most, because they're going to be top-five in the nation when we go to play them," Gonzalez said.

FIU will face Michigan State Mar. 7, which marks the first time since 2002 the Golden Panthers face off against a Big 10 opponent. 

The team will also face Rutgers, one of the top teams in the Big East, in a weekend series at home March 10-12. In their meeting last season, FIU took two games of an offensively charged three-game series, which featured a total of 49 runs scored. 

FIU will also play two games with local rival Florida Atlantic: Apr. 4 at FAU and Apr. 26 at home, for the last regular season game.

Sun Belt Conference play begins March 24-26 with a three-game road series against Arkansas State. FIU's first conference home series will be March 31-April 2 against New Orleans. 

The Golden Panthers will play an away series Apr. 14-16 with SBC newcomer Troy, who was the regular season champion of the Atlantic Sun Conference last season. 

Other conference home series will be against Louisiana-Lafayette, Middle Tennessee and Arkansas-Little Rock.

The 2006 Aeropostale Sun Belt Conference Tournament will be hosted by Western Kentucky in Bowling Green, Ky. May 24-27.

Headline: Women's soccer season ends with SBC tournament loss
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The women's soccer team entered the Nov. 2 match against No. 3 seed South Alabama with high hopes. However, the sixth seeded Golden Panthers were faced a harsh reality with a season-ending, 3-0 shutout loss in the quarterfinal round of the 2005 Aeropostale Sun Belt Conference Soccer Tournament. 

The Jaguars (11-4-1) were arguably the hottest team in the conference and were too much to handle for FIU (4-8-4).

USA scored early on as Tiffanie Stewart set up Tanya Allegretti for a goal in the 11th minute. 

In the 25th minute of the match,  the Jaguars' Second Team All-Conference midfielder Rebecca Kahn extended the lead, 2-0.

The nail in FIU's coffin came in the second half when First Team All-Conference midfielder Kelly Tarrant knocked in USA's third and final goal off an assist from Allegretti.

The Golden Panthers were outshot 12-11 in the loss, but had a 7-6 advantage in shots on goal. 

The loss marks the ninth time this season the women's soccer team has been shutout by an opponent. 

Senior forward Janet Liguori ended her successful career as a Golden Panther with three shots - two of which were on goal.

Liguori finished the season with a team-high four goals for a total of eight total points.

The loss also marks the final game for key seniors: captain Nastassia Rodriguez and forward Tamara Kochen

Kochen finished the season with three goals and a team-high three assists for a total of nine points, also a team high. Rodriguez had one goal for the season.

South Alabama goalkeeper Kelsie Langford recorded seven saves in her shutout win. 

FIU's junior goalkeeper Laura Snell started the game, made two saves and allowed two goals. 

In the second half,  Snell was replaced by sophomore Madeline Gannon, who allowed one goal and made one save.

Headline: After brush with death, Brazilian thrives in 2005
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's hard to imagine the FIU men's soccer team without senior midfielder Lucas Scudeler.

On the offensive side of the field, he leads the team in assists, guiding the ball to his teammates with the slightest of ease. And on the other side, he is a force in the box -  cutting off corner kicks to prevent shot attempts. 

With FIU's postseason hopes on the line, head coach Karl Kremser expects more of the same from Scudeler at the Conference USA tournament Nov. 9-13. 

 "Lucas has been a delight to have here," Kremser said. "He distributes the ball very well and has had a very good career for us."

A very good career that nearly ended before it started.

Scudeler was born in São Paulo, Brazil, home of many celebrated futbolistas.

"Your first gift in Brazil is a soccer ball," he said, "so even if you're not good, you play soccer."

Lucky for Lucas, he was good. 

The lefty won the Golden Foot award in 2001 and led his high school team,  Colegio Objetivo, to the Paulista Championship. Professional soccer was on the horizon. 

But on a night out with friends, life caught Scudeler by surprise.

"We went to a bar and I was coming back," he recalled, "and there was a stop bump on a road and I went to the side to move quicker. My tire exploded. I lost control and I fell in a river, like eight meters. I don't really know how I survived because the car was destroyed."

The same Lucas Scudeler who now scurries swiftly around the University Park soccer field lay shell-shocked in a hospital bed. He had torn the posterior cruciate ligament in his knee and endured aching pain in his thighs and lower back. 

"I had to be laying down for three weeks and I couldn't walk for one month and a half," Scudeler said.

Meanwhile in Miami, Jose "Kike" Ruiz - former FIU soccer star and countryman of Scudeler - recommended Scudeler to coach Kremser.

"Two weeks after that car accident, I started to talk to coach [Kremser] by e-mail," Scudeler said. "The doctor said he didn't know if I could play again. 

"I couldn't speak English and I went to a course and learned. After the course, I went to the gym, doing all the physical therapy and treatment."

Only two months following his brush with death, Scudeler joined the FIU men's soccer team in the Fall of 2002. 

He was surprised with what he saw on the field.

"I wasn't expecting that good of a level of soccer here," Scudeler said. "I was really impressed."

As Scudeler worked his way back to full health, his coaches helped him adjust to the differences of American soccer. 

"Talking to coach and talking to [assistant coach Munga Eketebi] I realized that my best qualities are passes," he said. "So all the time I go out there I always try to find the open man and create situations so we can score."

In each of the past three seasons, Scudeler has earned more assists and scored more goals than the year before. 

The 2002 Atlantic Soccer Conference Rookie of the Year added All-ASC honors in 2003 and 2004, as FIU wrapped up back-to-back-to-back ASC championship seasons. 

This year, FIU is in Conference USA and the competition is stronger. But so is Scudeler.

Scudeler has posted a career-high seven assists thus far in 2005, leading C-USA with 0.58 assists per game. He stands 14th in the nation in the same category.

At 5'6" and 150 pounds, Scudeler doesn't have the luxury of overpowering opponents. So he uses his brain.

On Sept. 18 against Xavier, forward Judah Hernandez was fouled driving the ball across midfield. As Xavier defenders cleared the area with their backs turned, Scudeler scooted in and dribbled the ball into the box before passing off to Carron Williams for the game-winning goal. 

Then, against Kentucky Sept. 30, he recognized that the Wildcats were bunching nine defenders around their goal. His signature passes would have been useless.

So what did Scudeler do?

He shot - 11 times - and scored the game-tying goal. For the entire 110 minutes, he never took a seat on the bench. But if he had sat, he still would have contributed.

"He's a very unselfish player," Kremser said. "Even when you take him out of the game he understands and cheers just as hard for his teammates."

After he hangs up his number 10 FIU jersey and earns his bachelor's degree in marketing, Scudeler is unsure if he'll play soccer again. 

It's a familiar feeling. He's not the least bit worried. 

He's confronted the biggest bump on the road of life and has lived to play another day.

"I really live the present," Scudeler said. "I don't worry about what I'm going to be in one year. I want to play in the next level. Let's just see what happens. Let life dictate it."

Headline: ALL DRESSED UP
Subheadline: Newly implemented dress code benefits NBA, players
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Setting a dress code for the NBA and its players is a good idea for two main reasons. It obviously sets a good image for the league, but more importantly, it serves as a crucial reality check for today's athlete and his or her place in the world.

In the age of seven-figure signing bonuses, million-dollar shoe deals and millions of adoring fans, athletes seem to lose track and forget that the rules of society still apply to them.

Despite the attention they receive and the media hoopla that surrounds them like a bad rash, playing in the NBA is still their job and a privilege they should feel lucky to have.

This couldn't have come at a better time. Less than a year ago, the league witnessed one of the nastiest incidents in the history of sports.  

Ron Artest ran into the stands that night in Detroit and sparked not only one of the biggest brawls in basketball, but the beginning of negative perceptions toward the NBA and its players.

Sure, a simple dress code cannot stop players from getting into fights and breaking the law, but it's a step in the right direction for a league that seems like it's beginning to head toward a collapse.

Besides, although I'm sure many of his "homeboys" back in Philly loved it, Rasheed Wallace showing up for games with a heavyweight title belt did not sit well with the heads of a billion-dollar league.

He's only one of the many, however, that would come to nationally televised games like most of us dress for school.  And many of these people - unsurprisingly - found the dress code to be a violation of their freedom.

"I think it's wrong. You shouldn't judge a person from what they wear," said Allen Iverson told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.

No A.I., you shouldn't judge people for what they wear. But, unfortunately, we do. This is a world of pessimistic, cynical people and those are the ones that sign your paychecks.

Where do you think most of the league's revenue will come from these next several years? It won't be from your "dawgs" back at home, watching you at Aunt Shirley's.  

It will be coming from different countries such as Europe, Africa, South America, China, Japan and Australia - where we've seen an influx of players come from.

For the past two years, the NBA has run camps in Africa, played exhibition games in China and spoken at several other countries in the hopes of globalizing their sport.

Once again, the league needed a change. And a right one at that.

Big ups go to NBA commissioner David Stern and his tough, take-no-prisoners attitude. Thanks to him, the league has not completely fallen apart.

While other commissioners (without mentioning any names, Bud Selig) take a back seat to their players, Stern has always been able to put his foot down in a league where so much tension and mixed personalities have been waiting to explode.

Those other weak authority figures are responsible for the modern athlete's convoluted perception of reality and their refusal to abide by the rules.

There's just a time and a place for everything and the workplace is not a time for expression; not when you're part of an industry as massive as the NBA.

The days of the role model being clean cut with no piercings or tattoos are almost long gone. 

Today's NBA provides color, flair and a lot of different characters. There's nothing wrong with that and it makes it all the more exciting.

But throwing on a suit is harmless to players, and very beneficial to the league.

Of course, some of us get the wrong idea with the dress code, and Artest has proven to mix up a few things here and there. He provides us with the most memorable quote of the offseason when he told the Indy Star: "I'm not really a suit guy, so I'm going to have some fun with it. I'll wear, like, purple shoes, yellow slacks, a burgundy shirt, cut-up tie and a lavender sport coat. I'm going to mix it up."

Headline: Let The Healing Begin
Subheadline: FIU took a beating during Hurricane Wilma but reconstruction efforts are underway
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
I've been living on campus for three years and have grown to consider University Park as my very large home.

Perhaps it is because of this sentiment that I felt a sort of shock after Hurricane Wilma struck, leaving the place that has become both my front and backyard in ruins.

This devastation comes at a bad time for the campus. I'd mentioned in an article published earlier this year that FIU's planned beautification efforts were something to be admired. 

The school has installed murals, new lamp posts and rest areas across various locations. Ruth Hamilton, director of the Graham Center, had stated that these improvements were meant to boost school spirit and help students gain an affinity for the university.

However, after both Katrina and Wilma blew through South Florida, many of these efforts were apparently laid to waste: Signs ripped from their posts, lamps strewn on the ground, construction debris blown across campus and other marks of the storms' paths.

Although cleanup crews worked quickly to clear the university grounds during the week the school remained closed, it can't be denied that the campus has changed, as though something beautiful and lively has been taken away from it.

Nothing struck me as much as the disappearance of the trees, many of them recently planted. Where once I used to walk under rustling branches or breeze-blown palm fronds, I was now left with sites that seemed empty and bare. The trees that had been a part of my personal garden were gone. My on-campus apartment never lost power, and yet I still felt as though my house had taken a pummelling by the storm.

The overall damage estimates for UP alone have not been announced yet, but I'm sure the numbers will be high. FEMA will help pay for some of these costs, though their aid will only be a percentage of the entire budget.

What remains to be seen is how administrators plan to renew or continue the beautification which began before the start of this hurricane season.

A simple plan would be to begin by fixing the most prominent areas, easily visible by visitors and new students. The rest plaza by GC had been welcomed as a great improvement, so replacing those tables would be a logical step. Sturdier trees should be replanted, especially around walkways, perhaps with wiring set around roots and trunks to ensure their stability.

The housing quad and apartments, which serve as living quarters for a large percentage of FIU students, should be the next focus of the cleanup process. No major damage occurred to the buildings themselves (in large part thanks to the hurricane windows installed during the Spring semester), so most of the work will probably be focused on the land around the residence halls. 

Many stumps remain to be uprooted, as well as wayward branches and palm trees that never fell but which still lost all their fronds, resulting in an ugly sight.

The Lakeview construction process, which has currently been stalled, retained no major damage, but it is possible that some of the debris may have been scattered around the quad. Extra care should be taken to assure that none of the debris causes harm, since the students use the field between buildings for such activities as soccer, frisbee and tag football games.

For now, it remains to be seen how long it will really take to mend the campus so altered by a few hours worth of wind. FIU has been struggling for many years to reach the prominence of other universities, improving upon itself as though it were a beauty queen candidate competing for a crown.

Though the hurricanes have proved to be encumbrances in the race to better the aesthetics of the campus, the university's continuing growth will undoubtedly catch up to the current needs, fixing with time any of the current blemishes.

Already toppled lunch tables have been lifted, damaged windows replaced and chipped walls painted over.

If anything, these storms proved that the university's biggest quality may not be its scenery and looks, but rather, its resilience.

Headline: Political independence a sham
Author: Andre Bisasor / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
I recently had several political discussions with a friend who happens to be a staunch conservative Republican, and another friend, a staunch liberal Democrat. Since I consider myself an "independent" voter, I found myself at times defending certain ideas held by Republicans when talking with the liberal friend, and defending certain ideas forwarded by Democrats when talking with the conservative friend. 

As an independent, I try to deal with issues on a case-by-case basis, and to judge the validity of an argument based on whether it makes sense or has flaws, without regard to which party is on which side of the argument. This, I believe, is part of what defines "intellectual honesty".  

In both cases, when I articulated the exact same viewpoints, I was tagged either as a liberal or a conservative, depending on who I was talking to. It was as if, ideologically speaking, there existed no such thing as an "independent" or a "centrist." 

Yet, my attempt was merely to be a bridge between both parties by challenging certain assumptions that both held about the other's position.  

Sometimes people have an exaggerated view of the other person's position when in fact there is more common ground present than realized; if only some of the hyperbole, jargon and incendiary language are stripped away. 

I thought my judicious "umpire-like" approach would be welcomed as a breath of fresh air. But what I found instead was something that seems to characterize modern-day American political discourse: An absence of intellectual honesty, restraint and civility. Stereotyping, emotional posturing, personal attacks, logical fallacies, self-contradictions and hypocrisy seem commonplace with little conscious effort to rectify them.

At the heart of this problem is what can be called "intellectual bias." But can we really expect people to recognize their own bias? 

This conundrum reflects a fundamental aspect of human nature, which is the fact that we all have bias, presuppositions and vested interests grounded by our life experiences, culture, upbringing, and socio-economic background etc. 

Of course, it goes without saying that any attempt to completely achieve objectivity or to eliminate bias will be an exercise in futility. Yet, bias by itself is not necessarily the problem. It is bias compounded by an unwillingness to face facts head on, so to speak, that creates an insurmountable problem. Developing a "truth-seeking" orientation is a helpful way to mitigate bias.

It is clear when you listen to media pundits such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter and other such popular self-proclaimed voices of the right wing, they are not interested in the truth. 

That is to say, they are clearly not interested in acknowledging that they could be wrong or in delineating an honest assessment of the pros and cons of their arguments. They are simply interested in forwarding an ideological agenda regardless of any contrary fact, evidence or logic, spinning half-truths, twisting facts and ultimately in actively deceiving the public in order to "win the argument". 

The same exact thing can be said about Al Franken, Bill Maher, James Carville and other such popular self-proclaimed voices of the left wing.  

There is a desperate need for a return to intellectual honesty in America today. This requires a humble acknowledgement of the "finitude of human certitude" and an acknowledgement of the "finitude of human perspective."

Another requirement is educating on the rules of logical reasoning and argumentation, especially fallacies. This will provide somewhat of an objective framework that can expose bias as well as establish a hedge against those who would try to deceive you and sell you an intellectual "bill of goods."

I myself remain cautiously optimistic that if more people embrace these principles, there just might be a chance for intellectual sanity to return to modern-day American public debate.

Subheadline: FIU's response to disaster abroad stronger than its response at home
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Hurricane Katrina drastically devastated the University of New Orleans and FIU was one of the first universities to aid during a time of need. A series of food, water and money drives were set up in order to aid UNO. While these were all gracious efforts that made FIU students and the Miami community proud, it is very disappointing to see that after Hurricane Wilma critically affected South Florida, FIU has done nothing to help victims in its own backyard.

Various organizations made posters showing the disasters in New Orleans and ways to help immediately following Katrina. A week after Wilma, no organization found ways to help sufferers in Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties. The only kind of help the university gave was an emergency blood drive which was no surprise considering that bloodmobiles can always be found on campus asking for student donors. While the devastation was not near that of New Orleans, people are still in need of help. 

There are still families without power, families whose houses were completely destroyed, not to mention citizens who may have suffered injuries through the course of the storm.

For Katrina victims, the university raised close to $18,000 and enough food and supplies to fill two trucks. 

Students living on campus were not spared. Numerous trees fell on cars and there were no generators to aid residence halls.

The damages Hurricane Wilma has caused to South Florida have shown on national news broadcasts for nearly two weeks now, and even though Americans pity Floridians for having to repeatedly stock up food, board windows and wait in long lines for gas, no relief efforts have been planned for us. The Miami community doesn't need pity - it needs help.

Headline: Flu shot available on campus
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
As the flu shot becomes available at limited places in South Florida, FIU students and faculty have nothing to worry about.

The vaccine will be offered at the Wellness Center for a discounted cost of $12 for students and $16 for faculty starting Nov. 7 at both University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus.

Maxim Healthcare Services, which offers flu-shot clinics at retail sites such as supermarkets and drug stores, has postponed giving shots citing Hurricane Wilma related problems and a national vaccine shortage. 

The company has canceled the year's remaining flu-shot clinics in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. This comes in the wake of the vaccine becoming highly unavailable last year as there was a shortage across the country. The only way for people to get the vaccine is through a private physician or county health departments.

"People without physicians will have a hard time getting [the vaccine]," said Wellness Center physician Adena Franklin. " [But] FIU is prepared to offer the vaccine. We do it every year."

Despite the vaccine being highly recommended for people 65 and older; residents of long-term care facilities; people under age 65 with chronic illnesses; babies age 6 to 23 months; pregnant women and health-care providers, students wishing to get the vaccine are encouraged.

"The recommendation has to do with your age and students aren't at the age of a health risk as older adults, but it is recommended," Franklin said. "Athletes who do large amounts of traveling are highly recommended."

At UP, the vaccine will be offered Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, it will be offered from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. At BBC, the vaccine will be offered by appointment only. Students and faculty must present their FIU identification to be eligible.

Headline: Dean appointed interim provost
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
University President Modesto A. Maidique announced on Nov. 4 that Ronald Berkman, executive dean of the College of Health and Urban Affairs, will become FIU's interim provost once Mark Rosenberg leaves in late November.

Rosenberg, who has held the position of provost and executive vice president since 1998, was confirmed as chancellor of the state university system on Oct. 26. Berkman is expected to make the full transition on Nov. 22, a day after Rosenberg's last.

"I feel very excited about this, about taking another big part in this university," Berkman said. "I think FIU is an amazing story considering what it has done in such a short time and I'm glad that I've been here long enough to take part in it."

Although neither Rosenberg or Maidique could be reached for comments, the president stated on a university-wide e-mail that "in his new role, Dr. Berkman will have major responsibility for advancing the university's scholarly initiatives" as well as continuing an on-going effort to merge various departments and schools. 

Berkman stated that though he hasn't had the job long enough to begin making any major decisions, he realizes some of the challenges facing him and is ready to confront them as soon as he can.

"There are a lot of challenges and obstacles ahead. I'm going to review all the issues taking place at the university and try to manage them as best as I can, though of course, a day on the job is not enough to get policies made," Berkman said.

Besides the university's need for outside sources of revenue (including federal research grants and private funding), Berkman feels another great issue at the moment is the approval of the medical school by the Florida Board of Governors, a struggle that has been taking place for almost a decade.

"We feel the need for a medical program to be of great importance," he said. "We are also working hand-in-hand with [the University of Central Florida] to inform the BOG that all data shows the state is in need of more medical schools. This is a big priority at the moment."

Another problem closer to home are the current contract negotiations being arranged between administrators and the faculty union.

Earlier in the year, clashes between the union, the Board of Trustees and administrators over labor contract agreements reached critical moments, with faculty members booing BOT members and leaving meetings en masse as protest.

"I want to try to bring this to a resolution as quickly as possible, though I'll admit, I still haven't been briefed on everything happening around this," he said. Dr. Rosenberg has done an incredible job as provost; everything he does has been a labor of love for him." He's a consummate professional and will do all he can to help facilitate this transition."

Berkman has had 15 years of academic administrative experience, 10 of which were held at FIU, where he is the university's longest serving dean.

He began his FIU career in 1996 as dean of the College of Public Affairs (a position also formerly held by Rosenberg) and was one of the leaders in charge of spear-heading the law school initiative. A search for a permanent provost will begin in the summer, an effort Maidique assures will be nation-wide.

Headline: Organizations unite for Katrina relief
Author: Nicole Acosta / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans  on Aug. 29, the University of New Orleans was devastated.

Almost immediately after the damages in New Orleans were assessed, Paulina Munoz, traffic manager from the Office of Public Relations, said FIU students, faculty and staff asked themselves, "What can we do to help these people?"

Since then, Munoz has become the head of the Katrina relief efforts, and the atrium in the Graham Center has become the headquarters. In charge of supplies collected for the relief efforts, Munoz said she has collected about everything from 156 gallons of water, to baby toys, to canned and non-perishable foods and even a few pet supplies. 

Over $17,679 has been raised, according to Anne Goodrich, who is in charge of monetary donations. There is still money coming in.

Goodrich also mentioned that Nov. 10, in the midst of FIU's Music Festival, there will be an All American Celebration. 

This is a concert  dedicated to military veterans. 

Tickets are $5 for students, $10 for faculty and staff and $17 for the public. 

All ticket proceeds go to the Katrina relief effort.

About $716, and some clothes and water were collected at the last FIU football game Oct. 1 against Florida A & M. 

However, collections and donations will continue to be accepted. Also, there are still some upcoming events, such as a comedy show and a concert. 

Christine Denton, vice president of Student Government, has been helping with planning and awareness for the drive. 

Denton said that different organizations asked "what to do for the Katrina relief."

"We have been trying to unify them all for a greater cause," Denton said.

Denton has also helped accommodate the students of UNO who were given sanctuary at FIU.

 Trisha Fonseca was in charge of collecting baby items for Alpha Xi Delta. She said they collected over 585 baby items before the football game against FAMU. 

"If Florida had nothing, we would feel grateful that someone was thinking about us. It's putting ourselves in their shoes," Fonseca said.

Baby items were collected for two weeks. Also, the sorority collected monetary donations during the football game, but they still don't know how much money was raised in total. 

Munoz and Denton both agreed it was important to help UNO specifically for several reasons. 

One reason, FIU, being a school that was devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, could relate to the devastation of New Orleans by Katrina.

"When Andrew hit Miami, we almost got wiped out," Munoz said. "A lot of universities and institutions helped us."

When Katrina hit, "We decided to do the same thing," Denton said. "Being a resident in an area affected by hurricanes, I know firsthand what it feels like to go through such a tragedy."

Another reason FIU decided to help out UNO is because they are "sister schools," said Munoz. 

Both UNO and FIU are in the Sunbelt Conference, a division under which teams compete throughout the year.

"We thought the community can put a face to UNO because, since we interact with them throughout the year, it's good to know you're helping out a friend," Munoz said.

For those who still want to continue helping out the relief efforts for Katrina, there is still work to be done.

Munoz and volunteers were supposed to leave for UNO's satellite campus Oct. 23 with the supplies that have been collected, however, due to Hurricane Wilma the departure has been postponed for a future date still pending. 

Help is needed packing up the supplies and loading them into the trucks that will head up to New Orleans. 

 If you wish to help out, Munoz can be reached at 305-348-2232.

Most believe FIU is divided between just the University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campuses. The Wolfsonian, FIU's premier museum located in the heart of Miami Beach, is also a major part of the FIU community.

Director of the Wolfsonian, Cathy Leff, believes the students of FIU should take advantage of what the museum has to offer.

"Some students use the Wolfsonian as a main research tool, but not enough [students]," Leff said.

The Wolfsonian is a great outlet for student research, and not many students know that. Along with the libraries on both campuses, students are able to visit the library available at the Wolfsonian on an appointment basis.

"The Wolfsonian library is comprised of nearly 47,000 rare books, periodicals and ephemeral items and includes more than 17,600 reference books," said Associate Librarian Frank Luca.

In order to honor the industrious research done by students who use the resources available at the museum, the Wolfsonian is currently sponsoring its first annual essay contest available to all students. Prizes include two scholarships: One for $500 and the other for $300.

"The concept of this annual essay contest is to honor and acknowledge  FIU student research based on the Wolfsonian," said Assistant Director for Planning and Special Initiatives Regina Bailey. 

Academic departments including art, economics, political science and architecture, teach classes at the Wolfsonian each semester. 

Some art students take installation art courses at the Wolfsonian and later present their work in exhibits around the Miami Design District, according to Leff.

The museum will be celebrating its 10 year anniversary this November. Over 100,000 artifacts - composed of fine art, graphic designs, political propaganda, furniture, rare books and even ephemeral materials including postcards and travel brochures can be found at the museum.

The amount of persuasive strength art and designs have are meant to be signified in the museums exhibits. Along with this, the definition of modernism and the history of social, political and technological changes that have improved society are explored as well.

The celebration, entitled "A Very Wolfsonian Weekend," will begin Nov. 11 and conclude Nov. 13 and is sponsored by JPMorgan. A variety of events are planned in which students, families and other Miami locals, are all invited to attend.

The fall exhibit "In Pursuit of Pleasure: Schultze & Weaver and the American Hotel," will open to viewers for the first time during the celebrations. The exhibit explores hotel culture during the 20th century, including the works of designers who designed such hotels as The Biltmore Hotel and The Breakers.

Even though some students take the research tools available at the Wolfsonian for granted, some, like senior Rebecca Dilorgan, know better.

"Students should take advantage of everything FIU has to offer, and the Wolfsonian is a great kept secret. I've used [the museum] countless times and always end up finding anything I need during my research process," Dilorgan said.

Headline: A Guide to Being Bored:
Subheadline: College absurdest explores the finer side of garbage
Author: Raquel Cool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you find yourself  constantly announcing how bored you are, you might want to ask yourself what you are doing wrong.

In this excerpt from a novel called "Small Gods," Teri Pratchett offers some perspective about facing the same things everyday: "One of [the brain's] functions is to make the miraculous seem ordinary, and turn the unusual into the usual. Part of the brain exists to stop this [from] happening. It is very efficient, and can make people experience boredom in the middle of marvels."

If our minds are unconsciously glazing over the familiar, what might we be missing out on? I find that one of the first steps to defeat routine is to seek out something where there seems to be nothing. Take trash, for example.

Not long ago, I was distracted by something in the driveway across the street. It was a glorious sight: The inviting gleam of sweetly abandoned garbage! Stacks of abandoned cardboard, just waiting to be assembled into a box fort in my backyard. I paced back and forth, bargaining the consequences of asking strangers for what is definitely their trash.

My congratulatory task was then to separate the usable boxes from the diaper-ridden and inexplicably soggy ones. 

If you're wondering, there are other sources of cardboard. Let's suppose that you are opposed to dumpster-diving for it - ask a local warehouse; they are probably happy to get rid of them. It is almost startling how willingly people will part with the contents of their garbage cans.

The next step required the help of a few friends, a box cutter, duct tape and an, otherwise uneventful, afternoon. We stroked imaginary goatees, pondering the possibilities.  

What was mildly silly soon turned into full-blown ridiculousness. A basic idea evolved into quirky little additions to the fort.  We'd announce the overwhelming need for secret doors, a drawbridge and a finger puppet theater.  We  invited friends over for tea with my miniature tea set. Strange looks followed. 

We mostly loafed around the floors of our cardboard living room, taking turns pretending to be dead and outlining our silhouettes with a black magic marker.

The finger puppet theatre consisted of tiny barn animals mimicking the works of playwrights or the ever-classic scenes of "Saved by the Bell". You've never seen "The Vagina Monologues", as recited by a finger puppet pig. 

We camped out, attempting to exchange ghost stories over a flashlight before realizing we knew none. It was the most fun I had in months and I didn't spend a dime. It's nice to think that none of it would have happened had I not noticed the trash in my neighbor's front lawn.

Headline: Diary of a Sorority Pledge
Author: Raynel Kinchen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Raynel Kinchen rushed earlier this semester. This is her story.

Many people asked me why I wanted to join a sorority, especially as a junior, when most girls join during freshman year. And I have many answers. While being at school for a couple of years, I got a chance to see where I truly belonged in the scheme of things, and I knew that I was ready to become involved in campus life. I also wanted a home away from home and a bond with others. I wanted to work towards a common goal with a group of people who understood and supported me. 

A sorority is an excellent way to accomplish all of these things. This past September, I underwent the process of sorority recruitment. 

Sept. 6: Orientation

I walked over to the Graham Center  ballrooms and stood in a line containing somewhere around 500 young women all seeking sisterhood. After we were seated, presidents and representatives for every National Panhellenic Conference sorority on campus gave inspiring speeches about finding a home in their particular sorority. After the speeches, I opened my pamphlet, which displayed the manner of dress that would be appropriate for the evenings that followed. 

Then I met my Rho Gamma group, which consisted of all of the young women with whom I went through recruitment. As I walked back to the dorms later on, I overheard a discussion of two ladies on what "everyone" claimed to be the "cool" sororities and what they planned on joining to get access to the hottest fraternity members. 

I hoped that by the time the recruitment experience had passed they would have changed their minds for the better and found a sorority that was "cool" for them. 

Sept. 7: Sorority 101 Night

I was very nervous. It was the evening in which I met actual sorority members from every group - a charming and sincere event. As my group walked into each room to visit a sorority chapter, members greeted us by chanting, singing and cheering. Several members asked simple questions. 

It was a great opportunity to not only let them learn about me, but for me to learn about the sisters in each organization. Every sorority has colors, mascots, etc. 

But there were other questions: Why did you choose this group? What do you like best about your sisterhood? This night was long, but it was a lot of fun. 

Sept. 8: Philanthropy NIght

I again visited all six chapters. They each had us make a craft, which they would later donate to children. While we worked, they explained their national and/or local philanthropies. 

It was sometimes hard to maintain decent conversation while making a sometimes very detailed craft, but I did the best I could. Some philanthropy presentations spoke to my heart very sincerely because I adore children, but all the philanthropies are worthy causes. On this day, the dues of the sorority were explained to me. All of them were affordable and in most rooms were included;  payment plans were discussed for those who might need it. Later, I ranked the sororities to my preferences.

Sept. 9: Semi-Formal Night

We were asked to dress accordingly and were treated to a deeper understanding of each sorority we visited through slide shows and interesting conversation. The highest number of chapters that any girl may visit is four. 

Some ladies had a full schedule, some did not. For those who didn't have a full schedule, there was a waiting room. While waiting, we discussed our favorite sororities and what we liked about them. I got up twice to visit chapters and at the end of the night I ranked all of the sororities again. 

Sept. 10: Preferential Night

I visited two different chapters, which is the maximum number possible - the process attempts to narrow down everyone's two best options. Dress was more formal than the night before. I witnessed two very emotional and intimate open rituals, showing what it might be like to be a part of both sororities. 

They involved candlelight, singing and speeches. I really enjoyed this evening and spent a great deal of time crying (I was very happy). When I went that evening to rank the chapters I visited I could not have felt more satisfied. Many girls expressed worry about possibly not getting their first choice, but we would not know until the next day. 

Sept. 11: BID DAY!

I went to GC and waited impatiently with my Rho Gamma group. 

One group at a time, we went upstairs and we each received an envelope with our names on it. I watched as the other girls ripped open theirs, some hugged and fell on the floor in excitement. 

I opened mine and happily discovered that I had received my top choice! 

I received my Bid Day shirt and waited to meet more new members. At 4 p.m. we lined up and headed to the GC Ballrooms, where the revealing took place. After revealing my t-shirt, which announced my choice, I was mobbed by sisters of the sorority. For what seemed like forever, I saw nothing but the arms of sisters. 

Then out of the noise, chants arose from the groups. Through my tears, I smiled for photographs. This was definitely a great day.

Headline: Sequel satisfies audience's blood lust
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
One word summarizes Saw II: gory. The sequel to last year's horror film Saw delivers fans of the original movie more bloodshed and more gruesome deaths. Although Saw II has a different director (Darren Lynn Bousman), serial killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) returns to indulge fans by tormenting victims with his sadistic games and deadly traps. 

The tone of the movie is set in its opening scene. A man wearing a spiked "death mask" fails to discover the key to remove it and meets a bloody end which will definitely have theatergoers cheering in their seats. Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is called in to investigate the man's death and subsequently discovers Jigsaw's whereabouts. 

Once Matthews finds Jigsaw, the focus of the movie shifts to eight individuals trapped inside a rundown house as part of Jigsaw's game. The house is filled with deadly traps that the characters have to face in order to escape.

Saw II's set design is impressive. The dim lighting and the dirty appearance of the house adds to the gloomy atmosphere of the film. Every room has its own distinct setup and the attention to detail is uncanny. The rooms give off an eerie vibe and foreshadow the characters' impending doom.

Furthermore, the movie's setting allows for some sickening and disturbing scenes. One particular trap involves digging through a pit of hypodermic needles to find a door key. Another trap forces a character to crawl into an oven to obtain a specific object. If moviegoers are looking for a violent fix, Saw II certainly gives viewers what they want. 

Although the movie provides fans with a creepy atmosphere and plenty of gore, Saw II downplays its characters. As the movie progresses, viewers learn more about the characters' backgrounds but the film fails to instill moviegoers with any sense of sympathy for them. As the people die off, there is no reason to really care. In fact, some of the characters are so annoying that their deaths are welcomed. In terms of character development, Saw II falls short. 

Nonetheless, the film features some strong acting. 

Tobin Bell does an excellent job as Jigsaw. His cold and calm demeanor fits the serial killer role effectively. Bell's tone of voice is creepy and his lack of emotion is intimidating. 

Also, Donnie Wahlberg delivers a solid performance as detective Eric Matthews. His ability to play the roles of both assertive cop and caring father is terrific. When Matthews discovers his son Daniel (Eric Knudsen) is one of the people trapped inside the house, Wahlberg's persuasive portrayal of a man with fatherly instincts effectively grabs at viewers' hearts. 

Unfortunately, the people trapped inside the rundown house disappoint with their lackluster acting. The only reason to even bother paying attention to them is to watch how Jigsaw plans on torturing and killing them with his creative yet gruesome traps.

In addition, Saw II does something exceptionally well: Plot twists, which are intricately laced. 

Some are shocking and others reveal characters' true motives. 

Although Saw had its share of plot twists, the film contained several plot holes. Saw II does not suffer from the same problem. Instead, the sequel adds clever plot lines without compromising the actual plot.  

Overall, Saw II is an improvement over its predecessor. 

While the original Saw was filled with glaring plot holes and laughable overacting, the sequel avoids the noticeable problems of its predecessor. 

Forgettable characters and some bad acting plague the film, but this movie was never intended to be an Academy Award winner. Instead, Saw II entertains fans with what they want - lots of blood and a high body count.
