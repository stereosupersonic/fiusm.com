Headline: Football enjoys week off, prepares for Western Kentucky
Author: Dan Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The football team took advantage of their week of rest to examine their goals and accomplishments thus far in the season.

"Everyone gets a C," Head coach Don Strock said. "One day your defense gives up 377 yards rushing and then 50 yards another day."

"It's just as if you were in school, you get an A here, but a D or an F and now you got a C."

It is no secret that the penalty situation is making Golden Panther fans, players, and coaches cringe at their every mention. FIU has accumulated 46 penalties for 392 yards already in its inaugural season.  

"The roughing penalties such as last Saturday, that's a referee's judgement call," Strock reiterated. 

Strock turned his attention to FIU's next opponent, No. 4 Western Kentucky.

"They are an excellent football team. They've beaten Youngstown State who has won four or five titles. We need to play teams like this to see where we are as a program. Next year we're playing the Georgia Southern's and the Troy State's," said Strock.

Talent Pool

A huge reason for FIU's success up until now is due to the fact that they have been able to lure great athletes to its novice program.

The Golden Panthers, without playing a game, had already stolen a quarterback  and free safety from Florida, and have received transfers form UConn, Ole Miss, and West Virginia. All of which are quality division I programs. 

Key Performers

Freshman quarterback Jamie Burke has not disappointed after being named the starter late this summer. He has completed 53 of 87 passes (61%) for 840 yards with 8 touchdowns against 3 interceptions.

Rashod Smith has picked up the slack for an ailing backfield as he has rushed for 376 yards while averaging 5.9 per carry.

Cory McKinney, a transfer from the UConn, leads all receivers with 379 yards. In addition to that stat, he boasts a 29.2 yard per catch average. Statistically, McKinney is listed among the top receivers in Division I-AA.
Safety Nick Turnbull leads all tacklers with 38 and 3 interceptions, including the first in the program's history.

Brandon Higdon is leading the squad with 4 sacks.

Headline: SGC hosts second annual 'Level 5' party
Author: Christina Kent/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Despite some startup glitches, over 1,000 students attended the second annual SGA-sponsored "Level 5" party held at University Park Friday night.

"We expect it to be a big hit because it's a party at the semi-beginning of the year," student government President Jessica Morffi, who is also the event's coordinator said earlier that evening. "And it's a chance to have fun with good people and good music," she added.

However, the music, which was supposed to begin at the party's scheduled opening time of 9 p.m., didn't begin until 10:45 p.m.

"It was a little problem," Campus Life and "Level 5" Chairperson Malik Wilkes said. "It was technical." The DJs were having difficulty with the generators. 

Free tickets were available to students with ID several weeks prior to the event, and an estimated 1,500 picked them up this year.

Due to rain earlier in the evening, some students were uncertain they would attend the event.

"I was worried about the rain, I mean [the party] is on the roof," said freshman James Brown, an intended business major.

Guests mingled on the wet pavement, waited for the music to begin, and chatted with friends. Off to one side of the garage floor there were about 10 chairs, also wet from the rain.

"I heard about the party on Power 96 and from other FIU students," said Computer Engineering and Music Education junior Guy Michele. "It's too early for me to dance right now, [and when I do] I want to grind."

Shortly after the music finally began, it was halted so SGA members could give out freebies to the dancing audience. Glow sticks, bouncy balls, shirts and beads were tossed into the crowd.

Many students seemed surprised there were no alcoholic beverages, but bottled water was available.

"Alcohol is against our rules. This is a 'dry campus'," said Wilkes.

However, the absence of alcohol didn't dampen most people's spirits.

"It's obvious you can have a good time without that stuff," said Morffi.

Assistant Director for Campus Life and Student Government Council Adviser,Vicky Owles said about 675 guests had been given wristbands by 11:30 p.m.

By 2 a.m., an estimated 1,100 people had attended the event.

The party's location has become a tradition.

"It's outside of the regular [venue]," said Morffi.

"It's just something to do and I thought it'd be cool," Catherine Michelena, a freshman and intended English major, said. "It's on the top floor â€“ and nothing beats the Miami skyline."

Headline: Fraternity holds first overnight tailgate party
Author: Adriana Oliva/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity held the first FIU over-night tailgate party for a football game last Saturday.

 "Last week we were at a party and we were all sitting around when I said, `Hey, let's have an over-night tailgate party,'" business major Josmanny Horta said. "It was a chain reaction, one guy said he'd bring the pork, then another said he'd bring the box to make the pork in, and so on and on."

The fraternity brothers began roasting the pig at 3 a.m. and it was not done until 11 a.m.

Students and faculty were eating, drinking and dancing to DJ Un Real and DJ Cabose who had been spinning since 8 a.m. for the tailgate party. 

"We are all here sweating and feeling the heat but it's a great thing," English major Kevin Cortino said.

Drinking did not start until 8 a.m. Purple ribbons were given to those over 21 to regulate drinking.

"We were suppose to have a countdown to 8 a.m., which was the time allotted to us to be able to drink, but unfortunately not enough people were here," Horta said. 

Sigma Alpha Mu supported everyone, even the band that marched by them on the way to the field. 

"We've got about three brothers in the band, so we like to show our support and respect," former Sammy President Greg Acevedo said.

Expect more over-night tailgate parties from the fraternity.

"We are for sure going to have one for homecoming, everyone's invited not just Sammy's," marketing major John Carbaga said.

"I think it's great what these guys are doing, we've been out here tailgating too, and I can tell that they have a lot of dedication and spirit for the FIU community," Utilities Department Program Assistant Lupe Noboa said.

Headline: Alumnae die in Georgia van wreck
Subheadline: Jaderblom was sole surviving FIU student
Author: Hatzel Vela
&nbsp;
FIU alumnae Sasja Odenyo and Theresa Wint were killed in a car accident that also injured current student Erika Jaderblom and 12 other passengers early Sunday evening in Georgia, university officials said.

Both deceased individuals graduated this past spring and were members of FIU's athletic department.

Odenyo, a 23-year-old record-setting forward, played on the women's soccer team for the 2000 and 2001 seasons. 

Wint was a student trainer.

Jaderblom, 25, a senior and former women's soccer defender, was transported to Tifton General Hospital in stable condition and was later released.

The group was returning to Ft. Lauderdale after playing at an Atlanta area tournament with the Florida Rockets of the Broward Women's Soccer League.

They were traveling southbound on Interstate 75 in a van and at 5:22 p.m,  were involved in a multi-vehicle accident near in Ashburn, Ga., State Patrol Communications Officer Jeff Grimley said.

"Two other vehicles were involved," Grimley told The Beacon. "The van overturned several times and several [individuals] were ejected."

The cause of the accident is still under investigation.

"All of the young women involved were wonderful people," FIU Women's Soccer Coach Everton Edwards said. "I'm dumbfounded and numb right now. This is a sad day indeed for women's soccer at FIU."

Odenyo earned a degree in International Relations last year and owns FIU's single season goals and points records holder. The Swedish native scored 25 goals and tallied 57 points in 2000, on her way to a spot on the All-Sun Belt Team. 

No funeral arrangements were made by press time.

Headline: FIU routs Georgetown
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Saturday afternoon's rare, 1:00pm start brought about a lackluster crowd of just over 6,000 fans to FIU Community Stadium. The Golden Panthers got off to a sluggish start before kicking into high gear halfway through the first quarter and putting away the visiting Georgetown Hoyas 27-2. 

"This was the team that lost to somebody [third ranked Lehigh] 69 to nothing, so its not a miracle that we won this football game," said coach Strock. "But we started off slow."

After winning the toss,  the Hoyas went three-and-out for the possession, and were forced to punt. However, FIU could not better the Hoyas' first drive as they too were forced to punt following their first three plays.  

Long snapper James Knapp, who had been suffering from a hand injury a few weeks back, sailed the football over punter Doug Jones' head as it rolled out of the back of FIU's end zone for a Georgetown safety.

Following the botched kick that proceeded the safety, Georgetown and FIU would exchange punts before the Hoyas would start to explore uncharted territory, moving into FIU's side of the field after a fake punt gave them new life on the drive.

The Hoyas' progress would soon be halted as John Sims, Georgetown's sophomore running back, would have the ball jarred loose by a fierce group of FIU defenders. Duante Foster, a defensive end who played in the absence of injured Chris Horne and suspended Payton Williams, recovered the fumble.

"We really stepped up from last week," said Nick CarreÃ±o, who had two tackles, one of which included a sack that went for an 8-yard loss. "We just tried to play crazy [butt] football and fly to the ball."

On the ensuing drive, when it seemed as if the Golden Panthers could not proceed because of a holding call that nullified a big gain on a pass to Harold Leath as well as an illegal procedure penalty, a dump-off on third-and- three proved crucial as Jerrid Lundstedt took it for a 5-yard gain. Thus enabling the drive to continue.  

FIU was able to put its first points on the board after a pass to fullback Adam Gorman went for 17 yards and the score. Gorman, who had not touched the ball up until this point all season, added a great individual effort by spinning and breaking a tackle after being stood up by a defender at the 1-yard line. The Golden Panthers' drive tacked  4:55 off the clock and after eleven plays went for 59 yards.

"It didn't look like it was going to be open," said Gorman. "I made a spinning move and all I saw was daylight. I wasn't going to be stopped."
The point-after-attempt would be blocked by the Hoyas, thus leaving FIU with a 6-2 lead at the end of the first quarter.

After forcing another punt, FIU struck quickly, putting together a four play, 73-yard drive in less than two minutes to make it 13-2. A drive that began with Rashod Smith, who was suffering from bruised ribs, gaining 40 yards ended with a 38-yard strike from Jamie Burke to Joseph Struyf.
FIU would not look back from this point, as they went on to score once more on a 28 yard run by Rashod Smith, before quarterback Jamie Burke left the game with a separated left (non-throwing) shoulder after diving for a first-down. Burke would be replaced by backup David Tabor on the drive and the Golden Panthers did not miss a beat. On Tabor's third play of the afternoon he would find Cory Mckinney, who led all receivers once again with 3 catches for 76 yards, for a 39-yard score that made it 27-2.

The score would remain the same throughout, thanks in large part to an FIU defense that was trying to notch its second straight shutout at home.  Free safety Nick Turnbull continued his strong play as he led all tacklers with seven, including one that went for a loss of five yards. Turnbull also made his presence felt on special teams when he sprung loose Lagrant Perry on a punt return that would help setup FIU's third score of the day.
"I think we did a lot better than last week, we were better prepared to play today," said Turnbull, who leads the team with 38 tackles and 3 interceptions. "There were still a lot of errors that we could correct this week with practice. We can cut down on some stupid mistakes."

"It's a growing process and we understand that, and it's still a win," said coach Strock, as he broke down the game afterwards.	

Next up for the Golden Panthers is  a bye week, which seems as if it cannot come at a better time, given the injury situation. After their idle week, FIU will travel to Bowling Green, Kentucky to face No. 4 ranked Western Kentucky on October 12.

Injury bug bites Golden Panthers

It's official. The injury bug has bitten. Among those that are expected to spend some extra time in the trainer's room this week are Cory McKinney (left ankle sprain), Victor Cernius (right knee), Terrance Allen (right elbow bruise) and Bill Grant (bruised rib). All are expected to be at practice this week.  

Jamie Burke suffered a separated left shoulder and left Saturday's game in the second quarter.  Burke's X-rays were negative, and he will be further examined via an MRI.  

Rashod Smith is nursing a sprained left ankle.  There is no time table for Burke or Smith's return.

Penalties, penalties, penaltiesâ€¦..

The Golden Panthers were penalized 13 times for 160 yards Saturday afternoon.  One key penalty to note: Brandon Higdon piling on the quarterback after he released the ball while scrambling to his right, negated what would have been a Kris Thomas 75-yard interception return for a touchdown after he knifed his way through would-be tacklers in a zig-zagging fashion that drew praise from Strock after the game: "One of the most athletic plays I've seen."

Jones key in FIU's win

Punter Doug Jones, who was almost the goat early in the season as he accounted for some of FIU's kicking woes, proved very helpful in the Golden Panthers' victory over Georgetown.  Jones pinned the Hoyas deep in their own territory numerous times. He had three punts inside the 20, all of which ended up inside the Hoyas' 10.  

Time off

Don Strock said after the game that he will give the team their customary Sunday off, followed by Monday as well.  

Tuesday will be a short day, which will include some film watching, weightlifting and conditioning. 

Wednesday will be a regular practice. FIU will next play Oct. 12 at No. 4 Western Kentucky. The matchup will be the toughtest test, thus far, for FIU this season. The Golden Panthers have three home games remaining for the year.

Headline: Volleyball drops first two conference matches
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers were defeated in their first two conference matchups for the 2002 season. The team traveled to Arkansas to play Arkansas State and University of  Arkansas-Little Rock. 

Both teams had losing records. The two losses bring FIU's record to a dismal 4-11 overall and keep the Golden Panthers winless in conference play at 0-2. 

Nirvana Kos returned to the court after being sidelined with an injury. Vanessa Gonzalez-Vinas did not play against Arkansas State.
 
Arkansas State 3, FIU 2

FIU, the defending Sun Belt Conference champion, dropped its sixth consecutive match, 3-1 (30-20, 30-23, 30-32, 30-26)  against Arkansas State in Jonesboro, AR.  

The contest was the first SBC game for both squads.  
Junior Adriana Fundora (Miami/Braddock) paced the Golden Panthers (4-10, 0-1 Sun Belt) with another double-double. Fundora recorded 11 kills and 16 digs in the losing effort.

Nirvana Kos appeared to be regaining her old form. The senior saw action for the first time in six games after an injury sidelined her earlier in the season. Kos recorded a game-high 17 kills and nine digs.

The Lady Indians (5-8, 1-0 Sun Belt) owned a big advantage in attack percentage, posting a  .207 to .129 line. 

Debra Amundson (Miami/Westminster Christian) tied her career-high with 15 digs.

bArkansas-Little Rock 3, FIU 0/b

Arkansas-Little Rock overcame an unfavorable beginning to defeat the Golden Panthers 27-30, 30-24, 30-19, 30-19 at the Trojan Fieldhouse Saturday night.

FIU (4-11, 0-2) took the first game, capitalizing on Trojan errors.
UALR was penalized three times for serving out of rotation. At one point, a 25-24 Trojan lead  was transformed into a 26-23 advantage for the Golden Panthers. FIU never relinquished that lead in the contest. 

Fundora closed out the game with two final points on kills for FIU. 
The Trojans (5-6, 1-0) fell behind 4-1 to begin the game. They took the lead at 18-17.  Thanks to a Rachel Plants kill, UALR opened up its largest lead at 30-24. 

UALR opened the game on an 8-1 run.  Five of the points during the run came on unforced attacking errors committed by the Golden Panthers.  FIU battled back to close the gap to 12-7. That was as close as FIU would get. The game ended 30-19 with UALR winning.

The Trojans never trailed in the final game. They immediately opened up a14-7 lead.  

Larisa Durmesivic ended the deciding game with a kill and an ace to put the score at 30-19.

FIU was led by Jennifer Owens with 13 kills and Adriana Fundora with 11 of her own.  

Amundson added a match-high 10 digs.

FIU next faces South Florida in Tampa on Tuesday in a non-conference contest. The Golden Panthers then return home to face South Alabama in their home conference opener.

Sun Belt Conference Inks Programming Deal With Nation's First 24-Hour All-College Sports Network

The Sun Belt Conference has announced that it has reached a multi-year programming agreement with the nation's first 24-hour all-college sports network, the National College Sports Network (NCSN).  

As part of the agreement, NCSN will have the rights to cover championships, tournaments, events and regular season games across a variety of men's and women's  sports of the Sun Belt conference's member schools.

Headline: La sonrisa de Enrique Cruz
Subheadline: Mari Rosa Marrero
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Como dicen por ahÃ­... &#8220;SonreÃ­r no cuesta nada&#8221;. AÃºn en las peores circunstancias de la vida muchas personas logran mantener su sonrisa y contagian con su alegrÃ­a a otros que se dejan amargar por las trivialidades de la vida.

Enrique Cruz &#8220;Quique&#8221; vive frente a la Plaza del Quinto Centenario en el viejo San Juan y a pesar de que su  casa no tiene cuartos, baÃ±o ni cocina, Ã©l disfruta cada maÃ±ana de tener enfrente al OcÃ©ano AtlÃ¡ntico  golpeando con sus olas las murallas del Castillo del Morro y que a la vez baÃ±a el fantÃ¡stico cementerio que durante dÃ©cadas ha fascinado a los turistas con su aire de misterio. AsÃ­ ve Quique el lugar que hace varios aÃ±os le ha servido de morada. 

Aunque tiene una casita en La Perla Quique prefiere dormir en la plaza porque para Ã©l su techo son  las ramas de  los Ã¡rboles que lo protegen  por el dÃ­a del sol y refrescan el  ambiente con suaves brisas. &#8220;Yo estoy tranquilo viviendo en la calle y ahora con el fresquito de navidad dormir aquÃ­... Ave MarÃ­a que rico&#8221;, dice Quique.

Sus vecinos son adictos a las drogas que con cajas abiertas, sÃ¡banas sucias y jeringuillas construyeron su pequeÃ±o espacio para tener un lugar donde nadie los moleste mientras se inyectan heroÃ­na con una  habilidad que sÃ³lo se obtiene con la prÃ¡ctica constante del acto.

Quique naciÃ³ en RÃ­o Piedras hijo Ãºnico de una familia de clase media. Su vida era la de un adolescente normal hasta que cayÃ³ en el mundo de las drogas.&#8220;Yo iba a la escuela, tenÃ­a mi carrito y un par de novias. Me encantaba el jangueo igual que a ustedes. VenÃ­a mucho pa' aquÃ­(las barras del viejo San Juan) a darme los palos con mis panas y de vez en cuando me daba mi &#8220;trancazo&#8221; pero siempre volvÃ­a con mi familia&#8221;.

La sonrisa casi permanente que tiene Quique en su rostro se borrÃ³ por unos segundos al mencionar a su familia pero despuÃ©s de un corto suspiro siguiÃ³ hablando mientras su sonrisa volvÃ­a a aparecer clara y sincera como habÃ­a estado desde la primera vez que lo vi.  

Contaba que cuando tenÃ­a quince aÃ±os decidiÃ³ irse a vivir con un amigo porque sus padres lo regaÃ±aban constantemente por llegar tarde a la casa y le prohibÃ­an que bebiera. Su tiempo libre lo pasaba con su amigo en algÃºn bar y poco a poco se fue alejando de su familia y envolviÃ©ndose en el alcohol y las drogas. Dejo la escuela, vendiÃ³ su carro y en poco tiempo se vio en la calle pidiendo dinero para poder pagar sus vicios.

 Sus padres nunca mÃ¡s quisieron saber de Ã©l y le dieron la espalda. &#8220;Uno piensa que jamÃ¡s le va a pasar a uno pero a mÃ­ me paso&#8221;, dijo Quique sin dejar que su sonrisa se volviera a escapar de su rostro. 

En el Viejo San Juan se concentra la mayor cantidad de personas sin hogar en Puerto Rico. Las calles albergan a personas que como Quique no tienen  trabajo, casa ni familia. Basta caminar por la calle San SebastiÃ¡n, pasear por la calle San Justo  o simplemente pasar por la calle Cristo para encontrar personas adictas, enfermas de SIDA o alcohÃ³licas pidiendo dinero para comer o comprar drogas.

 &#8220;ResuÃ©lveme mamita que no he comido na&#8217; en to&#8217; el dÃ­a&#8221;, decÃ­a un joven frente a la Plaza del Quinto centenario mientras agitaba una taza verde  haciendo sonar las monedas que ya habÃ­a recibido.

El pedir en las calles es para los deambulantes un estilo de vida, es su forma de ganarse la vida. Algunos piden dinero sÃ³lo por pedir, otros han desarrollado su arte creando flores, grillos, barcos y otros diseÃ±os en pencas de palmas para venderlas al precio mÃ¡s popular en las calles de San Juan &#8220;un pesito&#8221;.

&#8220;Yo le lavo el carro a la gente que se parquea por aquÃ­ ( el estacionamiento de Ballaja) y les velo el carro por cinco pesitos&#8221;, dijo Quique con la habitual sonrisa que ya formaba parte de su rostro. Aunque dejÃ³ las drogas, Quique sigue dependiendo del alcohol. No tiene trabajo, pero cuando puede lava algunos carritos por sÃ³lo algunos pesitos que le servirÃ¡n para comerse algo y darse &#8220;una friÃ­ta&#8221;. 

Ã‰l pide dinero en las calles pero regala toneladas de sonrisas y comentarios alegres. Su cara siempre tiene dibujada una sonrisa y a pesar de las adversidades de la vida ha sabido conservar la amabilidad y la alegrÃ­a de seguir viviendo. Son muy pocos los que se resisten a darle su pesito para que les vele el carro porque a pesar de todo como dicen por ahÃ­... &#8220; una sonrisa vale mas que mil palabras&#8221;.

&nbsp;
Hasta ahora no se ha confirmado el nÃºmero de cadÃ¡veres transportados de contrabando a la Universidad de Lynn, ubicada en el condado de Palm Beach, por Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n, localizado en distrito de Dade.  Pero lo que sÃ­ esta comprobado es que entre ellos estaba el cuerpo de Madelleine Post.

En los Ãºltimos cuatro aÃ±os Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n,  administrada por su dueÃ±o Joseph Damiano, acordÃ³ con la Universidad de Lynn que cada semana se le suministrarÃ­a los cadÃ¡veres necesarios para el curso de embalsamado que se dictaba en dicha escuela.  

El acuerdo se hizo verbalmente. La universidad pagaba $110 dÃ³lares por cuerpo y a cambio recibÃ­a el tipo de cadÃ¡ver que necesitaba. Al terminar las prÃ¡cticas, la escuela no tenÃ­a que guardar el cuerpo pues el mismo dÃ­a la compaÃ±Ã­a de transportaciÃ³n se encargaba de recoger el cadÃ¡ver  y  llevarlo  a cremar. 

El Ãºnico requisito era el tiempo. La universidad debÃ­a hacer la solicitud de cadÃ¡veres con un mÃ­nimo 72 horas de anticipaciÃ³n y asÃ­ dar tiempo a Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n de hallar el tipo de cuerpo solicitado.  "Necesitamos un cuerpo obeso, trae un caso de gangrena, uno de SIDA. Ellos (la universidad) me decÃ­an lo que querÃ­an y yo se los suministraba", declarÃ³ Damiano en la deposiciÃ³n a la corte, el 17 de Junio de 2002.

Obtener los cadÃ¡veres no era problema, Damiano llevaba 45 aÃ±os trabajando en la industria funeraria, de los cuales 25 habÃ­an sido trabajando para el condado de Miami Dade.  Era el dueÃ±o de los crematorios: Alpha & Omega Cremation, Cremation Emporium y Oakwood Cremation y All Care Funeral Home.  AdemÃ¡s llevaba aÃ±o y medio trabajando para la funeraria Levitt-Weinstein, a quienes les daba varios servicio entre ellos  lo de transportaciÃ³n.   

El servicio de transportaciÃ³n de Damiano era bien conocido dentro del gremio, especialmente por los bajos costos que ofrecÃ­a.  Lo que no se sabÃ­a era que el surtido de cadÃ¡veres a la Universidad de Lynn sucedÃ­a sin autorizaciÃ³n de los familiares del difunto y sin el conocimiento de la funeraria. "En efecto, los cuerpos que yo llevÃ© a la Universidad de Lynn entre 1998 y el 2001 provenÃ­an de casas funerarias",  seÃ±alÃ³ Damiano ante la corte.   

El negocio iba muy bien hasta que en Abril del 2002 se hizo pÃºblica la denuncia de Jeffrey Post contra la Universidad de Lynn y la funeraria  Levitt-Weinstein. Los cargos: haber participado y conspirado en la venta y embalsamado del cuerpo de su esposa Madelleine Post.

La vÃ­ctima

Madelleine Post fue diagnosticada de cÃ¡ncer en el colon el 12 de diciembre de 1999.  A los 11 meses de declarada la enfermedad  Post falleciÃ³ en su casa.  &#8220;DespuÃ©s de la cirugÃ­a que se le practicÃ³ en febrero,  los mÃ©dicos nos sugirieron que cuidÃ¡ramos de ella en casa.  El cÃ¡ncer estaba regado y ya no habÃ­a mucho por hacer&#8221;,  seÃ±alÃ³ su esposo,  Jeffrey Post.

A pesar de los malestares de la enfermedad fue Post quien consolÃ³ a su esposo e hijos de su inminente muerte.  Juntos, ella y su esposo,  decidieron cuales serÃ­an los arreglos funerarios que se debÃ­an hacer para que todo se llevara a cabo de una forma rÃ¡pida. &#8220;El padecimiento de Madelleine ya habÃ­a sido demasiado traumÃ¡tico. QuerÃ­amos que el funeral fuera lo menos triste posible&#8221;,  dijo el viudo. 

Los arreglos funerarios se hicieron el 6 de Noviembre, 20 dÃ­as antes de que Post falleciera,  a travÃ©s de la funeraria Levitt-Weinstein.  Todo se hizo segÃºn sus deseos.  Ser velada bajo la tradiciÃ³n judÃ­a y despuÃ©s cremada, como era su voluntad. 

En el contrato con Levitt-Weinstein, Jeffrey Post solicitÃ³ los servicios de manejo, mantenimiento y supervisiÃ³n del cuerpo de su esposa por los empleados de la funeraria.  TambiÃ©n solicitÃ³ la  transportaciÃ³n del cadÃ¡ver de su casa a Levitt-Weinstein, de la funeraria al crematorio y regreso de las cenizas a su casa.  En el documento Post hizo la especificaciÃ³n de que el embalsamado era rechazado por razones religiosas.  

El viudo pagÃ³ un total de $ 2,960 dÃ³lares,  de los cuales $250 fueron cargos de transportaciÃ³n y $200 por cremaciÃ³n.  

El contrato de Post no fue diferente al de otros clientes de Levitt-Weinstein.  Como norma de la funeraria no se especificÃ³ en el documento el tiempo para realizar la cremaciÃ³n.   Sin embargo a Post se le dijo que las cenizas de su esposa se le debÃ­an entregar a mÃ¡s tardar 48 horas despuÃ©s del funeral.  No obstante,  la familia recibiÃ³ los restos de Post 20 dÃ­as despuÃ©s del velorio. 

La demora en la entrega de las cenizas no fue lo que originÃ³ la demanda del viudo a la funeraria y universidad,  sino una carta que le fue enviada por Levitt&#8211;Weinstein en donde se le informaba que su esposa habÃ­a sido embalsamada antes de ser cremada. 

&#8220;Â¿CÃ³mo podÃ­a sospechar de algo malo?  Se acababa de morir mi esposa.  Yo estaba sumamente deprimido como para pensar que el cuerpo de mi esposa iba a ser profanado de esa manera&#8221; dijo el viudo. 

El itinerario

DespuÃ©s del 29 de noviembre, dÃ­a en que se realizÃ³ el velatorio de Post,  la funeraria estaba a cargo de transportar los restos de la vÃ­ctima al crematorio y luego regresar las cenizas al viudo.  

Al dÃ­a siguiente del sepelio,  Levitt- Weinstein llamÃ³ a Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n para que recogieran el cuerpo Post.  A partir de ahÃ­ el cadÃ¡ver tomarÃ­a otro rumbo.  

Primero fue llevado a refrigerar a Preferred Refrigeration Systems.  Mientras le tocaba su turno para ser cremado en el crematorio de Oakwood, el cuerpo de Post fue llevado a la Universidad de Lynn para ser disecado.   

Tal y como lo indica el reporte de embalsamado realizado por la Central de Cuerpos Embalsamados, Madelleine Post fue momificada el 7 de diciembre de 2000. 

Aparentemente, la autorizaciÃ³n para que la prÃ¡ctica se llevara a cabo no era algo que preocupara ni a la universidad ni a la compaÃ±Ã­a de transportaciÃ³n. &#8220;No es mi trabajo pedir a la casa funeraria los permisos de los familiares para llevar un cadÃ¡ver de un lugar a otro.  Mi trabajo es llevarlos&#8221;,  seÃ±alÃ³ Damiano ante la corte.

Ante las acusaciones la universidad alega que actuÃ³ creyendo que todo lo que se hacia era legal. &#8220;La universidad recibÃ­a los cuerpos con la convicciÃ³n de que Ã©stos eran cadÃ¡veres de indigentes legalmente autorizados para   embalsamar&#8221;,  declarÃ³ Carol Mandel, vocera de la Universidad de Lynn.  Y con esa suposiciÃ³n la universidad aceptÃ³ y embalsamÃ³ cerca de 55 cuerpos en un periodo de dos aÃ±os.  

Los acusados

La Universidad de Lynn abriÃ³ desde hace dos dÃ©cadas la escuela de ciencias funerarias,   ofreciendo un extenso programa de asignaturas entre las que se incluÃ­an: dos laboratorios de embalsamado, una clase de derecho y otra de Ã©tica.

SegÃºn el manual de la escuela, entre los propÃ³sitos del programa estaba conocer las normas Ã©ticas de conducta necesarias para trabajar en los servicios funerarios.  

Lynn era una de las tres universidades del estado de la Florida que ofrecÃ­a el programa funerario.  Contaba con 244 egresados y 35 estudiantes inscritos,  hasta que en Abril del 2002 tuvieron que suspender sus clases por tres demandas.  Los reclamos provenÃ­an de tres familias que alegaban el embalsamado ilegal de sus familiares. 

 Los casos de Madelleine Post,  Ruth Field y Thomas Marnin  fueron los detonantes para que el Departamento de Regulaciones de Negocios y Profesionales iniciara una investigaciÃ³n.  Y presentara cargos contra la universidad por negligencia, incompetencia y mala conducta. 

Entre las irregularidades encontradas estaba la reciente  adquisiciÃ³n de la licencia de embalsamado en Octubre del 2000.  Es decir, el plantel estuvo enseÃ±ado y practicando tÃ©cnicas de embalsamados durante los primeros siete aÃ±os sin contar con la acreditaciÃ³n del estado.     

Ahora la escuela se enfrenta ante la posibilidad de perder la acreditaciÃ³n obtenida por El Colegio Americano de EducaciÃ³n Funeraria, la licencia de embalsamado y una multa de $45,000 dÃ³lares por haber embalsamado ilegalmente los cadÃ¡veres de Post,  Field y Marnin.

Ante la polÃ©mica,  la universidad alega que siempre actuÃ³ con buena voluntad y que nunca fue su intenciÃ³n ir en contra de la ley. &#8220;Tanto las tres familias involucradas como la Universidad de Lynn han sido vÃ­ctimas de las acciones de un negocio que no actuÃ³ con buenas intenciones.  Nosotros confiamos en una compaÃ±Ã­a que estaba acreditada por la el estado de la Florida y que ademÃ¡s trabajaba para el condado de Dade&#8221;,  seÃ±alÃ³ el presidente de la Universidad de Lynn,  Donal Ross,  en declaraciones a la prensa,  el 11 de Abril de 2002.

Por otra parte, la corporaciÃ³n Lewit-Weinstein, originaria de Cincinati, Ohio,  mantiene en los condados de Dade, Broward y Palm Beach varias funerias.  Las cuales son conocidas como Levitt- Weinstein Memorial Chapel y Beth y David Memorial Gardens.  

Lane Hurwitz y Benjamin Reid abogados de Levitt-Weinstein en la Florida se niegan a hablar sobre la participaciÃ³n de la corporaciÃ³n en el trÃ¡fico de cuerpos. &#8220;Hasta que el proceso judicial no se termine preferimos no hacer ningÃºn comentario&#8221;, dijo Hurwitz a la reportera. 

El negocio

Durante 25 aÃ±os,  Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n proporcionÃ³ sus servicios a las morgues y los hospitales pÃºblicos de los condados de Dade y Broward, el Miami Dade Community Collage, algunas funerarias privadas en Palm Beach y recientemente, Levitt-Weinstein y la Universidad de Lynn.   

&#8220;Desde 1977 hasta Mayo de 2001 Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n se dedicaba solamente a transportar difuntos. TrabajÃ¡bamos para casi toda la industria funeraria del sur de la Florida&#8221;,  declarÃ³ Damiano ante el tribunal. 

Aunque Damiano afirmÃ³ ante la justicia que no recordaba las ganancias obtenÃ­das por sus servicios, dijo que las tarifas de transportaciÃ³n eran las mismas para todos los condados.  Lo Ãºnico que variaba era cuando el cadÃ¡ver se llevaba de una ciudad a otra,  cada viaje se cobraba por separado.  Y para cada funeraria habÃ­a una precio diferente. &#8220;En el caso de Levitt-Weinstein el costo variaba, ya que con una firma tan grande no podÃ­a tomar otras cuentas&#8221;, declarÃ³. 

Sin embargo, muchos de los negocios que existÃ­an entre Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n y sus clientes se hacÃ­an de forma verbal. &#8220; Con los Ãºnicos que tenÃ­a un contrato escrito  era con el condado de Dade.  Con los otros era un contrato de palabra, nada escrito, nada en papel&#8221;,  dijo Damiano

 En este negocio los beneficiados eran muchos y entre ellos el Condado de Dade.  A cambio de las concesiones  para operar en morgues, hospitales y universidades pÃºblicas del distrito, Damiano le hacia al condado precios y favores especiales.

Le ofreciÃ³ al condado realizar cremaciones por un costo de $75 dÃ³lares por cadÃ¡ver,  lo que reducÃ­a sus costos en $250 dÃ³lares por cremaciÃ³n.  La tarifa que Damiano ofrecÃ­a estaba $100 dÃ³lares por debajo del resto del mercado. Por lo tanto, Damiano obtuvo desde 1994 hasta 2002 todas las cremaciones de los indigentes del condado de Dade y mÃ¡s adelante las cremaciones de gran parte de compaÃ±Ã­as funerarias del sur de la Florida.

El otro de los beneficiarios era Levitt-Weinstein;  los precios que Damiano le ofrecÃ­a eran mÃ¡s bajos de lo que cualquier crematorio podÃ­a mantener.  Por lo tanto la funeraria contratÃ³ a Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n y Oakwood Crematorio para que se encargaran de llevar y cremar a todos sus cadÃ¡veres.  

Para un crematorio el costo de una incineraciÃ³n es de $300 dÃ³lares y Damiano les ofreciÃ³ el servicio por $150 cada cadÃ¡ver.  La tarifa era tan atractiva que Levitt-Weinstein sub-contratÃ³ los servicios de Damiano.  Y mientras tanto la funeraria le seguÃ­a cobrando a sus clientes $450 dÃ³lares por cargos de transportaciÃ³n e incineraciÃ³n. 

&#8220; Ellos lo hacÃ­an (las cremaciones) mÃ¡s barato de lo que nosotros lo podÃ­amos hacer. No sÃ© por quÃ© ni como pero a nosotros eso no nos importaba&#8221;,   declarÃ³ Davida Beeman, gerente de Levitt-Weinstein en la oficina principal, ante el abogado de Post David Charlip.

Y por Ãºltimo la Universidad de Lynn, quien pagaba $110 dÃ³lares a Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n por recibir  un cadaver semanal.  El cual ademÃ¡s no tenÃ­an que guardar porque ese mismo dÃ­a la compaÃ±Ã­a de transportaciÃ³n lo recogÃ­a.  SegÃºn Damiano, en cada ocasiÃ³n se solicitaban por lo menos dos cuerpos para embalsamar.  El precio incluÃ­a el transporte expreso de cada cuerpo. 

El barÃ³n de la muerte

Con sÃ³lo una licencia de conducir, Joseph Damiano, de 65 aÃ±os, logrÃ³ construir un imperio.  Se iniciÃ³ limpiando en las funerarias y asistiendo en la preparaciÃ³n de los cadÃ¡veres.  Sin mÃ¡s educaciÃ³n que la secundaria, Damiano iniciÃ³ su propia compaÃ±Ã­a de transportaciÃ³n en 1977. 

 Para finales de los aÃ±os 90, Servicio Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n era sÃ³lo una de las compaÃ±Ã­as que Damiano habÃ­a creado dentro de la industria funeraria.  Sus servicios eran bien conocidos tanto en el sector pÃºblico como en el privado.  

Pero sus ambiciones fueron mÃ¡s allÃ¡.  Al cabo de los aÃ±os abriÃ³ cuatro crematorios: Alpha & Omega Cremation, Cremation Emporium y Oakwood Cremation y All Care Funeral Home. Y un almacÃ©n para refrigerar cadÃ¡veres llamado Preferred Refrigeration Systems of Broward County.

Ayudado por su esposa Margaret,  Damiano se encargaba de la administraciÃ³n y manejo de Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n. Mientras que sus hijos Yolanda, de 27 aÃ±os, se encargaba de Emporium Cremation y Anthony, de 36, se encargaba de All Care Funeral Home. El resto era administrado por socios.

La mayorÃ­a de las propiedades estaban registradas bajo nombre de socios, quienes contaban con las licencias necesarias para manejar los locales.

Con el tiempo Damino se convirtiÃ³ en el barÃ³n de la muerte.  Manejaba casi todas los negocios de la industria funeraria del Sur de la Florida, hasta que a finales de los aÃ±os 90 comenzaron los problemas.

La caÃ­da del imperio

Las denuncias comenzaron por el mal trato que Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n le estaba dando a sus clientes. 

&#8220;Entre algunos de los delitos denunciados en contra de la  compaÃ±Ã­a estaban robo de joyas a los difuntos y maltrato a los cadÃ¡veres&#8221;,  seÃ±alÃ³ el abogado de Post, David Charlip en una entrevista con la reportera. 

El primero en presentar las quejas fue la ciudad de Palm Beach, en donde se alegaban que Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n llevaba los cadÃ¡veres sin el debido cuidado. &#8220;Ellos llevaban los cadÃ¡veres en una Van sin la menor protecciÃ³n. Ni si quiera los cubrÃ­a&#8221;,  afirmÃ³ uno de los trabajadores encargados de la escuela de embalsamado del Miami Dade Community College.  

Pero eso serÃ­a sÃ³lo el comienzo de la caÃ­da del imperio.  En 1998 Damiano se enfrentÃ³ a dos demandas millonarias: una de $33.5 millones de dÃ³lares por haber perdido los restos de una mujer. Y otra por $5.5 millones por maltrato a los restos de una niÃ±a de 5 meses. 

Las estafas de las que Damiano se valiÃ³ para construir su imperio continuaron apareciendo.

En febrero del 2001,  fueron encontrados cientos de cuerpos en descomposiciÃ³n en la ciudad de Georgia.  El crematorio era propiedad de Damiano.  Y en Abril del 2002 el barÃ³n de la muerte fue detenido nuevamente, pero esta vez por transportar y vender cadÃ¡veres a la Universidad de Lynn sin autorizaciÃ³n de los familiares.  

Las contradicciones

A pesar de todas las denuncias y cargos en contra de Damiano, Ã©ste sigue libre.  &#8220;Damiano se ha escapado de la ley porque la mayorÃ­a de sus negocios los abriÃ³ bajo nombres de familiares o socios&#8221;, explicÃ³ Charlip.

Hasta ahora,  hay quienes se preguntan si la libertad de Damiano estÃ¡ conectada con los muertos que votaron en las Ãºltimas elecciones del condado de Dade.  &#8220;Desde mi punto de vista la impunidad con la que Damiano opera estÃ¡ directamente relacionada con el misterio de los muertos que votaron en las elecciones pasadas&#8221;,  seÃ±alÃ³ Charlip.  Quien a pesar de no tener pruebas,  dijo que esta serÃ­a solo una de las razones para que el condado de Dade le diera a Damiano, por 23 aÃ±os consecutivos,   las consesiones de morgues, hopitales y universidades del condado. 

SegÃºn la policÃ­a del condado de Broward,  Damiano es uno de los hombres mÃ¡s buscados y mÃ¡s cuidados por la policÃ­a.  &#8220;Ã‰l le debe dinero a gente muy mala y peligrosa. Si el hombre todavÃ­a estÃ¡ vivo es porque tiene una suerte especial &#8221;, dijo uno de los oficiales del departamento de policÃ­a quien pidiÃ³ no ser identificado. 

Entre otra de las contradicciones estÃ¡ el pago de la Universidad de Lynn a Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n. SegÃºn una entrevista con Ralph Covert, director de la escuela de ciencias funerarias del Miami Dade Community Collage, W.L. Philbrick, todos los cadÃ¡veres que la escuela embalsama son donados por el condado.  &#8220;Nosotros recibimos los cuerpos  a travÃ©s del programa de indigentes del condado.  Estos cadÃ¡veres son de personas que no tienen familia o que los familiares no tienen suficiente dinero para enterrarlos o cremarlos y entonces los donan&#8221;, dijo el director.

Philbrick considera inusual que la Universidad de Lynn pagara por recibir cadÃ¡veres que usualmente son donados por el condado. 

El final del trayecto 

Mientras las familias que incineraron a sus parientes en: Levitt- Weinstein, Alpha & Omega Cremation, Cremation Emporium, Oakwood Cremation y All Care Funeral Home se preguntan si el trayecto de sus familiares despuÃ©s del velorio serÃ­a el mismo que el de Madelleine Post; el Departamento de Regulaciones de Negocios y Profesionales continua las investigaciones para establecer el nÃºmero exacto de vÃ­ctimas.  Y determinar la magnitud del negocio de la muerte entre funerarias, crematorios, hospitales y universidades. 

&#8220;Desde que iniciamos el negocio la universidad sabÃ­a que estaba recibiendo cadÃ¡veres de funerarias privadas y nosotros tenÃ­amos la autorizaciÃ³n de Ã©stas&#8221;,  declarÃ³ Damiano ante la corte.

Aunque Damiano no ha sido demando por Post, Ã©l fue el primero en testificar  ante la corte.   SegÃºn Ã©l,  tanto la Universidad de Lynn como Levitt-Weinstein estaban al tanto del trÃ¡fico de los cuerpos.  

Los contratos y las facturas, de cuatro aÃ±os de relaciÃ³n entre la Universidad de Lynn y Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n,  son los Ãºnicos documentos que garantizarÃ­an la honestidad de la universidad.  Pero las pruebas no existen porque como el mismo Damiano dijo ante su declaraciÃ³n en la corte todo fue un negocio de palabra.  

Para Levitt-Weinstein su amparo estÃ¡ en la autorizaciÃ³n para embalsamar el cadÃ¡ver de Post.  Y esta es un hecho que no existe. Aparentemente, Levitt-Weinstein dejarÃ¡ que el juicio pase para entonces tomar una decisiÃ³n y hacerla pÃºblica.  

Mientras se concluyen las investigaciones y termina el juicio de la demanda de Post,  la Universidad de Lynn cerrÃ³ el programa funerario;  los estudiantes estÃ¡n a la espera de que la situaciÃ³n se defina.  

Del imperio de Damiano ha quedado sÃ³lo Preferred Refrigeration System y las demandas ganadas por los crÃ­menes cometidos a travÃ©s de sus mÃºltiples negocios funerarios.  

En cuanto a los familiares de las presuntas vÃ­ctimas no todo estÃ¡ perdido,  porque la Central de Embalsamos de la Florida lleva el control de los cadÃ¡veres utilizados para esas prÃ¡cticas,  a travÃ©s  de un informe de embalsamado y cuerpos tratados que realiza semanalmente,  y por el cual Jeffrey Post conociÃ³ el trayecto del cadÃ¡ver de su esposa despuÃ©s de haberse quedado en manos de Levitt-Weinstein y Servicios Profesionales de TransportaciÃ³n.

Headline: Tarjetas telefÃ³nicas prepagadas: cuando lo barato sale caro.
Subheadline: Marcela Bacigalupo
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Eduardo HernÃ¡ndez entrÃ³ a la estaciÃ³n de servicio donde comprÃ³ hace unos minutos una tarjeta telefÃ³nica prepagada para llamar a su hija de 4 aÃ±os en Nicaragua. La tarjeta no funcionÃ³. GastÃ³ 10 dÃ³lares en ella y lo Ãºnico que escuchÃ³ fue una grabaciÃ³n que le anunciÃ³ que su tarjeta no tenÃ­a saldo.

Eduardo reclamÃ³ al empleado de la gasolinera. El empleado se limitÃ³ a decir que no habÃ­a reembolso por tarjetas de telÃ©fono. Desde el telÃ©fono pÃºblico Eduardo marcÃ³ el nÃºmero de servicio al cliente impreso en la tarjeta. Nadie respondiÃ³ la llamada.

Ante la necesidad de comunicarse con su hija, Eduardo comprÃ³ otra tarjeta, de otra marca y esta vez de 5 dÃ³lares. LogrÃ³ comunicarse con ella pero la llamada se cortÃ³ a los 4 minutos, a pesar de que le correspondÃ­an 70. Eduardo colgÃ³ y volviÃ³ a marcar. "Esto es como la loterÃ­a", dijo.

Como Eduardo, muchos inmigrantes hispanos hacen uso de las tarjetas telefÃ³nicas prepagadas para llamar larga distancia porque sus tarifas son mÃ¡s baratas que realizar una llamada desde un telÃ©fono fijo o un telÃ©fono pÃºblico. 

Estas tarjetas permiten pagar las llamadas por adelantado. El comprador recibe una cantidad especÃ­fica de minutos dependiendo del valor de la tarjeta. A medida que la usa se reducen los minutos hasta que se acaba el tiempo comprado. La cantidad de minutos va a depender de la ciudad a la que llame y de la tarifa de la tarjeta.

Se las puede encontrar en todas las estaciones de servicio y en las tiendas que tienen en su mayorÃ­a clientes hispanos. Las hay de 5, 10 y 20 dÃ³lares, especiales para llamar a determinados paÃ­ses o para llamar a todos los continentes del mundo, en espaÃ±ol e inglÃ©s y con diferentes tarifas.

Edgar, administrador de una estaciÃ³n de servicio en Coral Way dijo que las tarjetas no dejan de presentar problemas. "Los clientes vienen a quejarse aquÃ­ que la tarjeta no sirve, que se cortÃ³ la llamada, que le robaron tiempo o que el nÃºmero no funciona. Pero yo no puedo hacer nada. Cuando los clientes se quejan mucho de una tarjeta en especial, ya no la pido." 
 
RegulaciÃ³n y problemas

La AsociaciÃ³n Internacional de Tarjetas Prepagadas (International Telecard Association), indica que las primeras tarjetas que brindaron este servicio fueron introducidas al mercado europeo en 1976, pero a Estados Unidos reciÃ©n llegaron en 1993. 

En un principio fueron destinadas al mercado de inmigrantes, en su mayorÃ­a hispano. En la actualidad el mercado es mucho mayor por la ventaja de poder controlar anticipadamente la duraciÃ³n de la llamada y evitar los recibos a fin de mes con sorpresivas cuentas.

La ComisiÃ³n de Servicios PÃºblicos de Florida es la Agencia Federal encargada de regular los servicios de telecomunicaciones en el Ã¡mbito estatal. 

Richard Tudor, director de la Oficina de InformaciÃ³n PÃºblica de dicha agencia, dijo que hay dos tipos de reclamos en relaciÃ³n a estas tarjetas.  El primero es que las tarjetas no funcionan en absoluto y el otro es que el precio de la llamada es mayor al esperado. 

"En el primer caso, puede ser que la tarjeta tenga una fecha de expiraciÃ³n o que la compaÃ±Ã­a no este brindando mÃ¡s el servicio o que nunca lo haya brindado.&#8221; dijo Tudor. "En el segundo caso, generalmente la razÃ³n es que hay sobrecargos o un mÃ­nimo de minutos cobrados por cada llamada y el usuario no estÃ¡ al tanto de las condiciones de uso" concluyÃ³.

La ComisiÃ³n de Servicios PÃºblicos de Florida emitiÃ³ en 1998 el Reglamento que establece las obligaciones para las empresas prestadoras de servicios prepagados y derechos para sus consumidores.

El Reglamento ordena a las empresas  registrarse ante la ComisiÃ³n antes de iniciar actividades y cumplir con una serie de normas de informaciÃ³n de sus tarifas y cargos a cobrar en lugares visibles de la tarjeta y del establecimiento donde Ã©sta es ofrecida al pÃºblico. 

El reglamento tambiÃ©n exige que toda tarjeta tenga impresa un nÃºmero gratuito para atenciÃ³n de quejas y consultas de los clientes, el cual deberÃ¡ funcionar las 24 horas del dÃ­a. 

Reglamento desconocido

La empresa Blackstone, con sede en Miami, provee servicios telefÃ³nicos prepagados desde 1995 y distribuye mÃ¡s de 100 tarjetas en todo Estados Unidos.  Blackstone cumple con registrarse ante la ComisiÃ³n de Servicios PÃºblicos de Florida. Sus tarjetas y las que distribuyen tienen un nÃºmero gratuito de atenciÃ³n al consumidor y cumplen con indicar la fecha de expiraciÃ³n y demÃ¡s informaciÃ³n de importancia en inglÃ©s y en espaÃ±ol.

"No lo hacemos porque haya regulaciÃ³n que nos obligue a hacerlo, ya que no existe, sino por la polÃ­tica de la empresa  orientada a satisfacer a nuestro cliente", dijo Clare Morgan, directora de ComunicaciÃ³n Corporativa de Blackstone.

Morgan manifestÃ³ que a pesar de que la ComisiÃ³n de Servicios PÃºblicos de Florida es muy activa, estos servicios no tienen un monitoreo de alguna agencia, entidad o asociaciÃ³n "No hay reglas de control. Una compaÃ±Ã­a puede empezar maÃ±ana bajo un nombre, imprimir tarjetas, venderlas y quedarse con el dinero. Pueden declararse en bancarrota hoy,  volver a operar bajo otro nombre maÃ±ana  y realizar la misma prÃ¡ctica."  

Servicio al cliente

Juan Pablo Tramezzani, estudiante argentino de FIU, es un usuario frecuente de las tarjetas prepagadas. Luego de comparar las tarifas de diferentes  tarjetas, decidiÃ³ usar la tarjeta &#8220;Milonga&#8221;, porque le daba mÃ¡s minutos de comunicaciÃ³n por su dinero.  Una noche la tarjeta que reciÃ©n habÃ­a comparado no funcionÃ³. 

Inmediatamente se comunicÃ³ con el nÃºmero de servicio de atenciÃ³n al cliente, el cual tenÃ­a cÃ³digo de Ã¡rea 305. Le contestaron pero no podÃ­an ayudarlo: "Me dijo que no habÃ­a atenciÃ³n al cliente hasta al dÃ­a siguiente por la maÃ±ana. No me dio la gana de colgar el telÃ©fono y le dije que estarÃ­a ahÃ­ hasta que me atendieran. Me quedÃ© una hora en la lÃ­nea.&#8221; 

Otro problema  es la informaciÃ³n que puede conducir al consumidor a equivocarse. La informaciÃ³n sobre los cargos adicionales, cargos por conexiÃ³n y cargos por servicio se imprime en letras muy pequeÃ±as.  Revisando las tarjetas se puede encontrar cargos mensuales, bimensuales, semanales y de mantenimiento de cuenta que no indican claramente en  quÃ© circunstancias serÃ¡n aplicados.

Muchos problemas pero pocos reclamos 

La ComisiÃ³n de Servicios PÃºblicos de Florida resolviÃ³ 44 reclamos de los  58 recibidos en el aÃ±o 2001 sobre tarjetas telefÃ³nicas prepagadas. 

Igualmente informan que tienen registradas 220 compaÃ±Ã­as que estÃ¡n autorizadas para brindar servicios prepagados, pero no tienen conocimiento de cuÃ¡ntas de ellas estÃ¡n operando actualmente.

La AsociaciÃ³n Nacional de Agencias y Administraciones de ProtecciÃ³n al Consumidor (NACAA) y la FederaciÃ³n de Consumidores de AmÃ©rica (CFA) realizan anualmente una encuesta entre las agencias de protecciÃ³n al consumidor en todo Estados Unidos a fin de establecer cuÃ¡les fueron los temas mÃ¡s reclamados por los consumidores. 

En el informe sobre la encuesta del aÃ±o 2000 * destacan los casos mÃ¡s relevantes que se encontraron en las entidades encuestadas. En el rubro correspondiente a Servicios PÃºblicos la Ãºnica entidad mencionada con reclamos de consumidores sobre tarjetas telefÃ³nicas prepagadas, es la ComisiÃ³n de Servicios PÃºblicos de Florida que reportÃ³ 115 reclamos. 

El informe indica que cuando la ComisiÃ³n realizÃ³ las investigaciones correspondientes, encontrÃ³ 20 compaÃ±Ã­as que no estaban registradas. Muchos de los nombres de las empresas eran sÃ³lo iniciales, como por ejemplo: C.M.L. Inc., J.D.S. entre otras, haciendo mÃ¡s difÃ­cil aÃºn para la agencia poder identificarlas y penalizarlas.

Michael Linfield, abogado especialista en protecciÃ³n al consumidor dice que los reguladores no actÃºan tan rÃ¡pidamente como debieran: "Tan importante como la ley  misma es hacer que se cumpla".

"El hecho de que los clientes no se quejen no quiere decir que no exista un problema". dijo Linfield.  Debido a que el  grupo objetivo de estas empresas es el grupo de inmigrantes,  que no hablan bien el idioma o no conocen los procedimientos, es muy difÃ­cil para ellos realizar sus reclamos. "Las empresas asumen que los inmigrantes son una comunidad que puede ser estafada" concluyÃ³.

El consumidor tiene que actuar

Bertha Fifer, residente de Miami, usa las tarjetas desde que cancelÃ³ el servicio de larga distancia en el telÃ©fono de su casa hace un par de meses. "Si bien llamar con tarjeta es mÃ¡s barato, se quedan con uno a dos dÃ³lares, Â¡por cada llamada!, Multiplica eso por la cantidad de clientes!" 

Bertha se fija en la tarifa y los cargos que la tarjeta incluye antes de comprarla. Cuando llama, anota la hora de inicio y la hora en que termina. Luego vuelve a marcar la clave de su tarjeta para saber cuanto tiempo fue descontado y cuantos dÃ³lares le fueron cobrados. Si hay alguna irregularidad, inmediatamente se comunica con el servicio de atenciÃ³n del cliente.

"Ahora sÃ³lo compro dos marcas de tarjetas porque me parecen las mejores, muy pocas veces se equivocan, pero cuando eso pasa, llamo al numero 800 y me devuelven los minutos&#8221;. dijo Bertha.

Hay muchas opciones para reclamar. Primero se debe recurrir a la empresa a travÃ©s del nÃºmero de servicio o atenciÃ³n al cliente que debe estar impreso en la misma tarjeta. Algunas empresas le devuelven los minutos reclamados.

La AsociaciÃ³n Internacional de Comunicaciones Prepagadas (IPCA) es una entidad formada por las propias empresas y opera una lÃ­nea directa de mediaciÃ³n (1800-333-3513) a la que se puede llamar en caso de tener algÃºn reclamo o consulta. 

Si no es solucionado el reclamo el consumidor puede llamar a la ComisiÃ³n de Servicios PÃºblicos de la Florida (1800-342-3552), a la DivisiÃ³n de Asuntos al Consumidor del Condado de Miami-Dade (305-375-3677) o al Servicio de ProtecciÃ³n al Consumidor (1800-435-7352.). Todas estas entidades brindan asesorÃ­a en espaÃ±ol e inglÃ©s.

&nbsp;
Men's soccer hosted the Eighth Annual Umbro Classic last weekend. Three universities, FAU, WVU and Columbia, came to Miami to play in this tournament.  

FIU 2, No. 22 Col. 1

In the contest against Columbia on Friday night, the FIU men's soccer team showed it was something else. The Golden Panthers played the No. 22 team in the nation, and came out with a 2-1 victory in overtime. FIU has now improved their record to 3-4-0 after dropping its first four matches.

There was a larger crowd at this home match than at any other this season. The hot and humid weather had no effect on the FIU team's energy. In the first half, the Golden Panthers were in control. The only goal of the period was made in the 23rd minute marker by midfielder John Pulido. Off a cross by Allen Handy.

Pulido kicked the ball straight into the back of the net.

"I feel we started off extremely well. We had good possession  [of the ball] and dominated the first half," said coach Karl Kremser. 

The Ivy League school became a larger threat in the second- half. Sixty-one minutes into the match, the Lions of Columbia made their comeback. 

Tommy McMenemy madeColumbia's first and only goal from 23-yards out in the penalty box. An FIU foul allowed the forward to kick past goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg, and even the score. 

This tie brought the teams into overtime, which lasted only 3:41. Forward Oscar Gill scored a rebound off a save by the goalie. With an assist by Matias Asorey, Gill gave Columbia its first defeat, 2-1.    

FIU Goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg, who was awarded on September 23rd Goal Keeper of the Week, made six saves in this game against the Lions. Columbia's keeper Dean Arnaoutakis made six saves of his own as well.   
"I liked the team's effort and hard work. I am very happy with what they got accomplished," coach Kremser said. 

FIU weakened Columbia's record to 4-1-0.

Headline: Editor evaluates political stance
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Last week, my father said something that's nagged me since then: "Jorge, you're becoming more of a liberal than I ever thought you would be."

Understand, my political savvy is somewhere around "none." I'm one of those jerks that votes in elections, picking whomever sounds the coolest. I'm independent only because I didn't know if I should be Republican or Democrat and someone told me "well, independent is kind of like undecided."

So it came as a complete shock to many people, including myself, when I made a comment on President Bush's strike first plan. After reading a news article on the plan, I said, "Bush is becoming more of a dictator by the week."  

The room gave me funny stares, so I went on to explain how it wasn't the actual strike-first plan that bothered me so much as the machismo attitude that the entire administration was exhibiting. It rubbed me the wrong way how Bush, Dick Cheney and even Colin Powell were treating our military superiority like some sort of ego-trip, showing off missiles like a penis-waving contest. "We're bigger and better than you. Don't make us go over there."

My dad brushed off the remark with an "Okay." My mother did the same thing. I figured they just didn't want to get into the debate. 

A few days later, I was helping my father edit a letter one of the scouts in his Boy Scout troop had written to a state representative. 

The letter argued against taking out "under God," from the national anthem because separation of church and state was destroying the moral fiber of our nation. It essentially stated that "God" represented whatever beliefs you did or did not have. It made no sense.

"The last thing you want to do is try to point out the 'flaws' in the concept of 'separation of church and state,'" I told my dad when he asked me what I thought of the letter. 

All I meant was that it was a bad argument to say that the Constitution was wrong. I wasn't taking a stance on anything.

My dad simply took away the letter and made the comment I quoted at the beginning of my column. What I didn't mention before was his tone. 

It was disgust with my being political. Is there anything wrong with being political? I'm a guy with opinions. Granted, most of them tend to be evaluations of TV shows, movies and websites. This does not make my political views unimportant, though.

I suppose all my complaining is in vain. After I explained this exact same story to one of my closest friends, she sighed and told me "Jorge, don't talk political. It's not your thing." Fine. Consider this the last time I bring it up.

Headline: Bush favoritism of Israel skews Middle-Eastern policies
Author: Andy Diaz/Senior Columnist
&nbsp;
In my last column for The Beacon, I mentioned briefly President Bush's moral relativism when it comes to international policy. I didn't mention however (not because I forgot but because it merits a column of its own) the most prominent evidence of this: Mr. Bush's support of Israel and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 

While the president seems bent on a war with Iraq that now seems unavoidable, he has refused to take any kind of action to deter the Israeli prime minister from committing great injustices to the Palestinian people and hindering their quest for statehood, democracy and peace.

President Bush continues to criticize the countries that he has categorized as an axis of evil and supports sanctions against them, sometimes even war, as is the case with Iraq, yet he refuses to take any kind of decisive action against Israel. 

The Israelis' military occupation and disrespect for a people's sovereignty, their authorization of settlements on foreign land and their pinpointed assassinations of Palestinian leaders are three of a long list of violations of International Law and United Nations resolutions that have become quotidian to the Israeli government and have drawn no credible attention from Bush. 

The recent Israeli sieges of the Palestinian cities of Ramallah, Nablus in the West Bank and Gaza City in the Gaza Strip â€“ conducted at a time when Palestinian officials were in the middle of talks regarding statehood, the reformation of the Palestinian authority, and the democratic phasing out of Yasir Arafat â€“ are yet another example of Sharon's disregard for peace with a Palestinian state. The Israelis claim the purpose of the military invasion was retaliation for the suicide bombing, which took place two weeks ago, on a bus in Jerusalem that killed six Israelis. 

However, the Israeli military has failed to go after Hamas, the group that claimed responsibility for the bombing and instead focused on Arafat's compound in Ramallah, demolishing all but one of a dozen buildings. Sharon said the siege would continue until 20 suspected terrorists, supposedly sheltered in the compound, where turned over, but refused to disclose any of their names. The siege has since stopped due to pressure from the international community.

Obviously, this is an attempt by Sharon to further demoralize the Palestinians, who already live under constant military scrutiny, and undermine their attempts at statehood. The residents of Nablus, for example, have been under military house arrest since June 21 with the exception of several occasions in which they've been allowed outside their homes to stock up on food. The nature of the Israeli military is so oppressive that children are not even allowed to go to school. The Associated Press and The New York Times have reported several incidents in which Israeli soldiers have fired into the air in order to scatter children on their way to school. If this is not with the intention of propagating terror, I don't know what is.

Sharon continues to encourage settlements, offering tax breaks and lower interest rates to Israeli developers willing to build on Palestinian land. Last Wednesday, Israeli settlers inaugurated a new settlement near Nablus.

President Bush needs to do more than just passively speak out against Israel. If he was serious, which he is not, about his condemnation of Israel's military incursions into Palestine, then he would hit the Israelis where it hurts â€“ their pockets. 

Israel is our biggest recipient of aid. Since the Camp David Accords of 1978, the United States has furnished the Israelis with $3 billion in aid a year plus a lot more in military aid, amounting to an overall figure of about $70 billion. I believe the United States stands at a crossroads in its foreign policy attitudes. We have the opportunity, being the only superpower left, to influence the world positively by pointing out injustice and reprimanding those who oppress their own people or a foreign nation. 

But we have to do so uniformly. We cannot expect the respect and support of the world in our quest to oust repressive and violent regimes if we do not hold our allies to the same standards.

Headline: Female atheletes burdened by expectations of femininity
Author: Patricia Ireland/Knight-Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
By Patricia Ireland
Knight-Ridder Tribune

Despite Title IX, passed 30 years ago, women and girls in sports still find themselves subject to a highly contradictory social message: be athletic, but be feminine, too. Women must excel not only at their sport but also at their conventional social role.

Particularly in sports like basketball and tennis, where bodies are on up-close and sweaty display, female athletes who hone their muscles and competitiveness as well as their skills face being labeled mannish, lesbian, or both.

In fact, in a recent issue of Sports Illustrated an article on the WNBA highlights alleged attempts by officials to feminize its players and achieve what is described as the "hyper-heterosexualization" of the sport.

Despite the required tennis skirt and her propensity for tears at Wimbledon, Martina Navratalova's grunting, short hair, attacking style and muscular, veined arms made her the target of a whisper campaign that said, "Of course she's good, but she looks and plays like a man." The whispers became self-satisfied snorts of "I told you so" when Martina came out as a lesbian.

Wimbledon champions Venus and Serena Williams find unflattering comments lobbed at them about their height, obvious musculature, aggressiveness and unladylike noises. Last year Amelie Mauresmo, with her strapping build, forceful play and open lesbianism, was dismissed by Martina Hingis as "half a man."

The fear of transgressing traditional feminine norms has so contorted women's body building that several years ago the sport split into body building and "women's fitness," where points are deducted for too much muscle, too little make-up, clenched-fists and not high enough heeled shoes.

And, in the you-just-can't-win category: Anna Kournikova, an intelligent, sensitive and business-savy young woman has been dismissed as a "dumb blonde" pin-up in a way that Andre Agassi never experienced when he, too, had million-dollar endorsement contracts that were out of balance with his low tour ranking and lack of tournament trophies.

For women to continue moving forward, not only in sports but in other competitive fields as well, we must keep expanding the conventional, constricting view of what's feminine. Let's stop forcing women to do an awkward balancing act between excellence and gender stereotypes. Let's give women and girls the freedom to excel without looking over their shoulders wondering if a whispering campaign is gaining on them.

FIU Football: After Bethune-Cookman, it must've been nice to face a smaller team. You know the adage: "pick on someone your own size?" Screw it. We'd rather win.

Level 5: A rave free of drugs and alcohol. We didn't see anyone with Vics vapo-rub either. Yet a good time was had by all. Nice to know a party on campus won't be a snore.

Gunster, Yoakley & Stewart: Lawyers going out of their way to do good for our international students. It's nice to know that even the legal community cares.

Losers

Miami Dolphins: We should change your name to the Miami Flounders, because the way you guys played against Kansas City, it's a miracle we've done good at all.

Level 5: Not to nitpick, but did you have to choose the main garage to hold the event? You took up valuable spaces for something that could have taken place at the second garage.

&nbsp;
To the editor:

We took note of the article that appeared in your Sept. 24 opinion pages, "SGC Officials do not deserve free housing," as well as the "Winners and Losers" section, which identified the president and vice president of the Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council as "losers."  

While you are entitled to your opinion and we appreciate your suggestions, we disagree with the statements made, which negate the purpose of the Student Government Council (SGC).  Be assured that the officers of the Council are dedicated to doing our jobs as best as possible and our office is always open to hearing the concerns of the student body.

The Housing Bill is the epitome of what we stand for â€“ serving the student body more effectively.  Having one of the executive officers live on campus decreases travel time to and from the university and allows more time to serve the student population and promote community on campus and between campuses.  

Regardless of what the final decision is on this matter, we appreciate the active stance and interest generated by the student body on the issue.  What we also deem important is an understanding between the SGC and the student body.  We urge you to come by our office and attend our meetings to find out why this bill has been proposed.  We believe it is always better to be well-informed about an issue before taking a stand, though we appreciate that there are other views on this matter.

We are here to represent the student body, thus our classification as 'losers' ultimately suggests that our constituents and the entire student body have 'lost', when news and issues are unfairly reported to them.  Though "politicians" by nature of our positions, our interest in politics stems only from our dedication to improving the experience of the FIU student.  

Continuing to address issues of concern, we are currently working on:

â€¢ Reducing the public transportation rate, 

â€¢ Creating a Wolfe University Center student governance board,

â€¢ Lobbying statewide to keep Bright Futures alive and tuition manageable,

â€¢ Establishing syllabi continuity,

â€¢ Hosting information programs such as, forums with top level administrators and a scholarship fair, 

â€¢ Enacting an international student scholarship drive with a goal of  $20,000, and

â€¢ Analyzing customer service rendered from various departments.

For the 2002-2003 action plan visit our website at www.fiu.edu/~sga.

Your SGC continues to welcome your opinions and suggestions. In the words of Voltaire, "Although we disagree with what you say, we will defend to the death your right to say it."

Adrian Carter
BBC Student Body President

To the editor:

In the Sept. 24 edition, The Beacon ran an editorial critical of the concept of the student government president and vice president receiving free housing. As a former president of FIU's North Campus Student Government, I understand and support the effort of the SGC president and vice president.  

In answer to your question, what distinguishes the BBC president and vice president from countless other student leaders is that unlike almost all other campus leaders, the president and vice president of the SGC are bound â€“ by the language of the Constitution of the student government â€“ to execute a certain number of office hours every week.  

The SGC president is required to put in 20 hours a week, and the vice president 15 hours, although a typical week will encumber both officers to a far greater extent. In addition to this statutory requirement, it is also incumbent on these officers to attend a wide variety of meetings with fellow student leaders and with administrators, not just between the two main campuses, but all around and even outside of South Florida.  

Taken in conjunction with the requirement that these officers must maintain both a minimum number of enrolled credits and a minimum grade point average, this consumes enough time to guarantee that neither will be able to hold any job outside of the one to which they have been elected. 

When I was elected to the office President Carter now holds, I sought the same opportunity in which he and Mr. Lewy are now interested, and with exactly the same understanding of the fact that living on campus will enable them to better serve the interests of the students.  

Although I was unsuccessful in that endeavor, I chose to live in Bay Vista Hall anyway, and paid my own way.  This decision was to the benefit of the students whom I had been elected to serve for several reasons.

First, living on campus and having the same open door policy in my residence as I had in my office made me more accessible to students in general, particularly to fellow residents.  

Second, by living on campus, I was able to understand all of the hardships peculiar to this situation.  When, for example, a severed power cable caused a loss of electricity in housing for a day and a half, I shared the darkness with my peers and keenly understood their frustration with the difficulties thus encountered.  Like every other student, I had room inspections, noisy neighbors and raccoons hissing at me in the stairwells.

The president and vice president of the United States get free housing. This benefit is also provided to the presidents of most prestigious universities, a distinction which FIU itself has acquired only recently.  

By bringing these executives to live in a place that affords them better access to the focal points of their labors, by providing at the same time an appropriate venue for official functions, and by thus removing the concerns from such persons that normally accompany the search for appropriate housing, such provision greatly increases their ability to focus their time and energy exactly where it belongs: in service to the needs of their constituents.

Headline: Editorial: Miami's legal community offers sound advice to international students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
One of the most important concerns for many international students at FIU, before classes and work, is the attainment of the proper paperwork and visas required to attend class in the United States. There is no question that it can present a major problem for students struggling to navigate the complex, ever-changing  immigration laws. Thankfully, members of Miami's legal community offered their services to students at a recent workshop held in University Park's newly constructed Management and Advanced Research Center. 

The workshop, conducted by members the Gunster, Yoakley, and Stewart law firm, informed students of several new changes that have been made recently to U.S. immigration laws, which include new information requirements, deadlines, guidelines for changes of addresses and the different types of visas available.

Just going to class and dealing with typical student tasks is tough enough without the added headache of having to understand complicated legal matters that directly affect them in such a significant way. Having professionals aid students in this way is a valuable asset to our university, especially with its significant number of international students.  

It is also refreshing to see members of Miami's legal community offering their expertise to students who may not be able to afford legal advice otherwise. 

Since students very often have legal matters to contend with like these, but are also burdened by the cost of tuition, hopefully, we will continue to see pro bono work like this from time to time at FIU.  It would provide an undoubtedly valuable service for students, international or otherwise.

Headline: Students get tips on visas
Subheadline: Congress changes rules after 9/11
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Anabel Llerandi is your typical student. She goes to class, studies, goes home and takes care of her assignments. But unlike most FIU students, she can't get a job, and as a result, she can't help her parents pay for classes or even textbooks.

It's not for lack of interest or because nobody's hiring. Llerandi, an international student, can't work because her visa has not been reinstated. 

"If I stay here studying, it's okay," she said while waiting in line to talk to an attorney from the Gunster, Yoakley, and Stewart law firm at FIU's Management and Advanced Research Center building last Friday. "But if I go home, it's a problem."

It'll be a problem because Llerandi, a senior, won't be able to come back into the United States and finish her education.

Llerandi was one of just 40 FIU students who attended a workshop at the MARC building aimed at letting students know about changes the U.S. Congress has made to the country's student visa system and the type of visas they can apply for.

"The bulk of the changes deal with information sharing," Gunster and Yoakley attorney Daniel Marinberg said. "The INS is starting to scrutinize students more."

In order for international students to attend a college or university, that institution must participate in the government's new Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, Marinberg said.

"[A college or university] must give information on a student's course work and their graduation dates and any criminal act that prevents them from graduating," he said.

Congress also approved a clause stating that international students cannot enter the country and begin studying without having been approved for an "F" student visa.

"[Students can only get a] 'B' visa, which allows them to come into the country for 60 days before classes start, if they've been approved for an 'F' visa," Marinberg said.

Students should also get in the habit of advising the government when they change their address. They have 10 days to do so, Marinberg said.

"They are going to start enforcing it," he said. "[INS] indicate they're going to watch your address. Students at dorms might have to change their address every year."

Ellen Von Geyso, another attorney at Gunster and Yoakley, said the Social Security Administration is also changing the way they will assign Social Security Numbers to aliens by checking with the INS first.

Driver's licenses for international students will now expire when their visa expires. Licenses usually expire 10 years after they are issued, Von Geyso said.

The changes come in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Von Geyso said. Some of the terrorists who hijacked jetliners were in the country with student visas.

"After 9/11, three or four months later, one of the terrorists were given a student visa," she said.

Norma, a 24-year-old FIU alumna, came to the workshop to get help with her situation. She did not want to give The Beacon her last name.

"Right now I'm not working because I'm out of status," Norma, who has a degree in Management Information Systems, said. "I'm waiting on some paperwork with the INS."

To stay in the country and work, Norma would need a work visa, which is not easy to come by.

Employers must solicit the government for a visa for their employees.

"A lot of employers are not willing to sponsor," Norma said. "Since Sept. 11, the number of those willing to sponsor has shrunk."

Still, she remains hopeful she will get some help from her former employer.

"I used to work for FIU," Norma, a Nicaraguan native who is also a Brazilian resident, said. "My employer here is trying to sponsor me â€“ that's the paper I'm waiting for."

If Norma is trying to get an H1-B visa, one of the temporary work visas the State Department issues, sponsoring Norma will cost her employer at least $1,000 and the paper work will take about 60 â€“ 90 days to process, Von Geyso said. For premium processing, companies will pay an additional $1,000. The perk to that added cost is that processing the application will be completed in 15 days.

"Employers are more than happy to pay the $1,000," Marinberg said. "To a company, $1,000 is nothing. They'll pay for it for a good employee."

The money the government collects from processing the applications is put into a fund to train American workers, Von Geyso said.

For now, both Llerandi and Norma are waiting for responses from the government.

"It's been 10 months and I still haven't heard anything," Llerandi said. "It doesn't allow me to work on campus or anything."

Headline: Great acting makes for moving "Mile."
Author: Joseph Martel
&nbsp;
Losing a loved one is a tragic thing for anyone to go through, and when the loved one is your only child, it is a truly devastating experience. In all honesty, I find it hard to imagine anything worse. As morbid as it may sound, this is what makes "Moonlight Mile" so enjoyable. Director Brad Silberling ("City of Angels') gives us a very realistic look at a family dealing with their loss and how they manage to find comfort in each other. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie about tragedy that was this well done. It's also a heartwarming story about finding one's true love as well as finding one's true self. The best part is the acting: The cast is simply magnificent.

Although the exact date is not made aware to us, the story takes place somewhere in the early '70s in a small American town. It's the kind of place where everybody pretty much knows everybody else, so when a young woman is killed in a shooting at a local diner,  the whole town grieves. Oddly enough, the only two people that don't seem to be grieving, or at least pretending to grieve, are the girl's parents. At the reception, rather than feel devastated, the father, Ben Floss (Dustin Hoffman), appears nervous and the mother, Josephine "JoJo" Floss (Susan Sarandon), is more upset about the fact that everybody else is grieving for all the wrong reasons. 

The only one who seems really devastated is the young woman's fiancÃ©e, Joe Nast, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He's the new guy in town and tries very hard to cope with the loss of the woman he loved, but it's not easy, especially with her old girlfriends hitting on him. 

Although he doesn't feel right with it, he decides to follow the original game plan, which is to stay in town and go into the real estate business with Ben. He moves in with Ben and JoJo, but that just makes it harder for him because he's forced to listen to them bicker about everything. 

The worst of it all is the legal battle against his fiancÃ©e's murderer. Their lawyer (Holly Hunter) tells them his sentence may be too lenient because of a technicality and they have to work really hard if they want to get the justice they so rightly deserve, as if they haven't suffered enough. It doesn't look like Joe is able to get a grip on things, if his dreams are any indication. 

Then, just when things are as bad as they can get, he has a chance encounter with Bertie, who is the keeper of the local post office, the manager of Cal's Bar, and the sweetest tomboy you've ever laid eyes on. For obvious reasons, neither one wants to admit it, but there is an instant attraction between them. 

The last thing Joe wants to do is to disappoint the two people who were nice enough to take him in. However, the two can't fight their feelings for each other and they fall in love. This is where we learn the truth of Joe's relationship to the Floss' daughter and that it wasn't as perfect as people thought.

"Moonlight Mile" was inspired by the 1989 tragic death of Silberling's girlfriend, actress Rebecca Schaeffer, so I feel a little guilty pointing out the flaws. 

The film grabs your attention in the beginning and keeps it in middle, but you lose it towards the end. 

The climax isn't that climactic and when the story's done, you feel as if you're left hanging. Still, there's enough great acting and good dialog to keep you from walking out on the movie. 

Before it's finished, the dam breaks, and everyone who needs to cry, does.

Headline: "Alabama" praises rootsy values
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
"You can take the girl out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the girl."  Before you kill me for opening with this almost painful clichÃ©, let me just say I have my reasons. Reese Witherspoon's latest effort, "Sweet Home Alabama," is just that â€“ an embarrasment of a film that despite a talented cast could not be saved from its innate, bland predictability.  

Witherspoon plays the role of Melanie Carmichael, a small town girl from humble roots who leaves her family, friends, husband and past in her hometown of Pigeon Creek, Ala. and manages to make a name for herself as a rising fashion designer and socialite. 

On the outside, of course, Carmichael appears to have it all, including an almost too perfect fiancÃ©, Andrew (Patrick Dempsey), a wealthy, suave and sophisticated politician whose mother (Candice Bergen) just happens to be the mayor of New York City. Following a fairy tale marriage proposal by Andrew, Carmichael is finally forced to return home to demand a divorce from the country-fried husband Jack (Joshua Lucas) and the past she left behind.  

Like any other mediocre romantic comedy, the film has its moments and the cast does save it from being a complete disaster, but for the most part the movie fails to offer anything more than flat lines and painful Southern stereotypes. 

Although this isn't the first time in cinematic history that stereotypes have been used for laughs, "Sweet Home Alabama" pushes its luck shamelessly, giving us poorly developed characters one minute and then demanding we feel something for them in the end. We are simply not fooled.  

The film seems to take far too long to get to the predictable ending we all knew was coming and eats up the time with flat comedic attempts and more "Yankee" jokes than should be allowed by law. What we end up with is a film that seems more like the bastard step-child of an inbred union between "The Great Gatsby," "The Beverly Hillbillies" and Jerry Springer.  

But at least Jerry Springer doesn't put on any airs.  "Sweet Home Alabama" tries to present itself as a movie about valuing the essence rather than appearances, but you can't help but wonder if Carmichael would have valued Jack's inner worth over Andrew's suave appeal had Jack not eventually become a financial success. Unfortunately, thanks to the film's lack of substance, we don't really care either way.  

Director Andy Tennant seems determined to be crowned master of the forgettable comedy.  As evidence of this, consider some of his earlier work: "Fools Rush In" and the Olsen Twins feature "It Takes Two."  

If forgettable is his aim, then to his credit I must say I can't remember a single memorable line from "Sweet Home Alabama" that I didn't already hear in the trailer or that can't be more appropriately attributed to Lynyrd Skynyrd's jukebox classic of the same name. In a shameless attempt to draw from the mass appeal of the classic title song, it plays twice throughout the movie. 

Save yourself the time. Catch the trailer and sing a drunken rendition of "Sweet Home Alabama" at any karaoke bar. You'll have an evening of more substance than this film could ever provide.

&nbsp;
Jackie Chan brings yet another action-filled buddy comedy to the big screen, but this time his co-star is Jennifer Love Hewitt. "The Tuxedo" has a fairly original plot, but it's still the same kind of movie he's always been known for. The twist is that this time, Chan's superpowers derive from the clothes he wears. 

Chan plays a taxi cab driver known for his recklessness, who becomes a chauffeur for a rich man named Clark Devlin, who also happens to be a CIA agent. When Devlin is hospitalized after a car explosion, it's up to Chan to save the day. 

For a while he is able to convincingly play the fish-out-of-water character as he battles to save the world from being destroyed by contaminated water, all the while wearing his boss's tuxedo. This magical contraption provides the wearer with all sorts of logic-defying abilities.

Jennifer Love Hewitt plays Del Blaine, a first time agent who becomes Chan's reluctant partner. The film also boasts a cameo appearance from James Brown, in an unexpected dance scene in which Chan gets his groove on in the tuxedo. 

Unfortunately, there are also many sexist remarks in regard to Hewitt's character and far too many comments on her "nice rack."

 Other than that, the only unpleasant part of the film involves a few scenes with huge beetles. These insects are part of the plot for contaminating the world's water source.

After catching a glimpse of how the movie will play out, the plot seems painfully predictable. I hope I'm not spoiling much by saying that Jackie Chan saves the day and manages to keep himself and Hewitt from getting killed. Also, it should be pointed out that Chan is one of the few remaining actors in Hollywood who doesn't take himself seriously all the time, and can play the hero without getting the girl in the end. Instead, he and Hewitt go out for coffee. As usual with Jackie Chan's flicks, the bloopers are shown as the credits play out.

I would only recommend this movie if you enjoy Jackie Chan movies and if there's nothing else worth watching at the time. Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewitt make an odd pair, but they manage to bring action and comedy together as well as a believable relationship between two agents. 

This is definitely not one of Chan's better movies, but it's not one of the worst either.

Headline: Springsteen returns to glory days
Author: Heather Brummer

It's funny how the whole thing about being objective goes right out the window when you're reviewing the music of someone like Bruce Springsteen. One can try to look at the album from a distance, pointing out just the good and bad. One can try, but it doesn't work. It looks like the Boss is back. 

Though his Live in New York was released just months ago, Bruce Springsteen has already arranged a tour with the E Street Band, hoping to surpass the huge response to their previous tour in 1999. Entitled The Rising, this tour holds the same name as Springsteen and the E Street band's recent album, the first recording the group has released together since 1984's Born in the USA

Some 18 years after that first release, The Rising is a collection of 15 songs which were each heavily influenced by the September 11th attacks. And while most of us cringe at the thought of being reminded once more of the traumatic events our country has experienced this past year, The Rising does not play on this. This is not an album which just drones on in an attempt to force some sort of emotional reaction. 

No, The Rising is better described as one man's attempt at shedding some light on what happened and how it's affected us. Yes, there are lyrics that will bring you down, but somehow the entire album comes together in an upbeat, appropriate way. 

"Into the Fire" was the first song Springsteen wrote, just days after the attacks. It serves as a tribute to the brave emergency personnel who were at the scene when the World Trade Center collapsed. With a melody that sounds almost like something you would hear at a religious gathering, this song's lyrics are both a tribute and an affirmation. 

The best lines are: "May your strength give us strength/ May your faith give us faith/ May your hope give us hope/ May your love bring us love."

Many of the lyrics are sung from a first person point of view, usually someone involved in the incidents, be it a firefighter or other worker on hand that day. Equally surprising is that the overwhelming message from this album is to pay tribute, grieve and get back up, not to take revenge. 

In fact, only one song, "Empty Sky," touches upon vengeance, with the lines: "I want an eye for an eye/ I woke up this morning to the empty sky."

Hope is an element that plays throughout the majority of the songs. One song, "Further On Up The Road," comes to mind when it states: "On a sunny morning we'll rise, I know/and I'll meet you further on up the road."

Many of the tracks on this album have religious themes running through them. "Mary's Place" comes to mind, for obvious reasons, as does the title song, "The Rising." But even when we listen, in no way do we feel as if religion (or anything else) is being pushed upon us, as the elements seem to fit in appropriately.

Perhaps the only thing about the album that, at first glance, may not seem to fit in, is the song, "Let's Be Friends." The track has nothing to do with the style of the 14 others at hand, but the song is centered on a longing for someone who isn't there. Naturally, this does make sense after considering the feelings that New Yorkers must have experienced shortly after the attacks.

All in all, The Rising is a good album, performed by someone who changed a decade as we knew it. Bruce Springsteen was, and still is, The Boss\. Even now, 18 years and a few gray hairs later, Springsteen and the E Street band are giving a concert that has already sold out in several states. The Rising continues to rise and is making others do the same.

Headline: BBC exhibition examines spiritual side of nature
Author: Kimelsha Wright
&nbsp;
On Thursday, Sept. 19, local artist and recent Florida International University graduate Orlando Soza held his first public art exhibition at the Tessie Franzblau Gallery, which is located on the Biscayne Bay Campus. I entered the gallery not knowing what to expect. The pieces on display looked like photographs of the sky that were framed and hung on the wall, but they were not photographs, Soza captured the essence of the sky in his series of pastel works, entitled "Spirit."

On first glance,"Spirit" does not evoke immediate joy or sadness, but one cannot help but look deeper, beyond the sky portrayed on canvas. 

"The sky's massive clouds move in a constant regeneration, traveling through powerful rays of sunlight. They are simply a depiction of my experience and association of a static moment in the sky to create a mood interpreted as a metaphor for spirituality," Soza said about his work. "Awakening," "Rebirth," "Winter Sky," "Silence" and "Emotion" are titles for pieces in the series that he uses to express  his sense of spirituality. Soza captures the light, shadows and ambiance of the clouds in his artwork.

 Most of his work is done in neutral colors so as not to be dramatic. Soza experimented with acrylic paint but found they appeared too plastic; pastels looked softer, resembling the features of the sky.

Jeanie Belgrave, an FIU graduate of video art attending the exhibtion, said her first impression was "You relate to it somehow." She summarizes the artist's vision this way: "What you get is how you feel, not just what you see." All the paintings are different and non-repetitive even though the artist uses the same subject matter. 

Soza began his venture into art at the age of seven when trying to copy the biblical depictions in his mother's Bible. He is originally from Masaya, Nicaragua and moved to South Florida when he was 11-years-old. Soza received his AA in Art Education from Miami-Dade Community College. Then he received his BFA in Visual Arts with a minor in Art History from FIU in May 2002. He plans to continue his studies in art and pursue a master's degree in Visual Arts at NYU.

Soza's influences and inspiration came from Clive King, one of his professors and head of the Art Department at FIU. Soza credits King for helping him "get [lost] in his work and challenge tradition," instilling in him the principle of "less is more." Another inspiration is twentieth century Spanish artist Salvador Dali, whom he fashioned his earlier works after. 

Soza has faced little criticism, but recalls one faculty member comparing his work to Hallmark cards. The artist said he doesn't have a problem with criticism and accepts and welcomes any interpretations. He says that most people are afraid of rejection but eventually you develop a thick skin. 

Soza's collection is far more than could fit in the Franzblau Gallery and his individual pieces range in size. Soza will begin to prepare for other exhibitions throughout South Florida.

Headline: Paulina Rubio fails to cross over
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
After six albums, Paulina Rubio has recorded her first solid attempt at an English language CD; so at 31, Paulina Rubio Dosamantes is attempting to work her way to the top with Border Girl. Rubio has found her niche as a soloist in the States despite the language barrier.

Border Girl has a variety of sounds in the mix, from techno to rock to pop. Rubio herself is often compared to Shakira, mostly for being yet another good-looking Latin pop star. Maybe that's why she has reached stardom so quickly; there can be no other explanation. I'll be surprised if she survives on the pop charts for long. 

Have you turned on the radio lately and heard "Don't Say Goodbye?" Isn't that a great reason to quickly switch stations? Both the beat and the lyrics are almost intolerable: "Whenever your heart is beating with mine/ Wherever I go/I'll keep my memories of you inside." Aww, how sweet. All I could think as I was hearing this song was: "Is the CD almost over yet?" Unfortunately, it's only the first track. Fourteen more to go.

Then there are songs like "The One You Love," crammed with Spanish guitars that cash in on her Mexican roots. Ignoring the lyrics is the best thing you can do when listening to this track because the guitar actually does sound pretty decent. But then slow songs like "Casanova" just drag. You never really feel like listening to her sing: "You're the center of my obsession/Watching you dance in your leather pants." Here's a piece of advice, Paulina: don't admit to such embarrassing obsessions. I know you "love toâ€¦spread [your] music and [your] messages," but hold back on some of them. It does not make you look all that good. And leather pants? Are you dating Ricky Martin? For this song, the skip button on my CD player came in quite handy. 

Then I came across a song entitled "I'll Be Right Here (Sexual Lover)," which was probably the most painful in the entire album. Listening to the lyrics made me want to cringe, never mind the title. 

Read this: "Soon you'll see cause I'm gonna make you listen (go go go go go go go)/ Soon you'll see I'll show you what you been missin' (go go go go go go go)/ Yeah I'll be right here looking out for you/ And when you come back you're gonna want me too." First of all, can she say "go" one more time? Second, it's just a song, Paulina, relax. Her hormones seem to be in full force, straining all the fun out of the music. 

Supposedly, one of Rubio's favorites on this album is the R&B-styled tune that features a rap cameo from new hip-hop star Pretty Willie. "Stereo" is about hanging out with friends and going to parties, and just having a blast. Themes like these are much too familiar. 

How many times have artists used outside performers to add some substance to otherwise negligible trifles? Think of the late Aaliyah as well as Nelly Furtado who incorporated rappers like Timbaland into their music. 

Sadly enough, I finally could enjoy the CD when I could no longer understand the language. The last four tracks on this album are in Spanish (which I do not speak or understand). That way, I could simply listen to the musical rhythms and tolerate her voice without my finger gravitating towards the stop button. Perhaps Rubio should consider remaining on her side of the border.
