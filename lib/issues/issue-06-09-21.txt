Headline: Opponents capitalizing on mistakes
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
After its 33-27 loss to Bowling Green, seven points is basically the difference between the 0-3 FIU football team being, at the most, 3-0.

Seven points.

On the bright side, at least the difference in the Golden Panthers' home-opening loss to Bowling Green wasn't an extra point again. That would have stung harder.

You can call the game a true team effort considering FIU's offense, defense and special teams each contributed with a touchdown, but it was a wasted effort.

The defense, which wreaked havoc on the two games prior to this one, had no answer for Bowling Green's two-quarterback spread offense led by sophomore Anthony Turner. 

It seemed that every time FIU would chip away at the lead, the Falcons would answer back with a score.

You have to hand it to the Golden Panthers for not giving up, but anyone who has followed this team for the past couple of seasons know that this team has a problem taking over close games. 

In this season against Middle Tennessee, a late MTSU touchdown - coupled with Chris Patullo's missed extra point  -  was at fault for the loss.

In week two, against the University of South Florida, Julian Ream's fumble late in the game - coupled again with Patullo's missed extra point - was the main reason for the loss.

This loss - although it's not simple to pick one particular moment to blame - doesn't mean there has been a pattern in FIU's first three losses.

FIU's opponents have capitalized on FIU's mistakes. Sadly, the Golden Panthers couldn't do the same.

The aforementioned reasons for the losses against MTSU and USF show moments when FIU's opponent took advantage of an FIU mistake.

In the loss against Bowling Green, a sequence of consecutive events in the first half allowed BGSU to capitalize on FIU.

With a 7-6 lead - thanks in part to, coincidentally, a BGSU missed extra point - the Golden Panthers had a chance to take a lead and take momentum from the Falcons after intercepting a pass deep in BGSU territory. 

However, senior quarterback Josh Padrick threw a short pass that was immediately intercepted right back in the end zone for a touchback. BGSU drove 80 yards for a quick score and would score again off an FIU fumble on the ensuing kick off.

That sequence made the score 20-7 in favor of Bowling Green. Even though FIU would eventually get within two points, it was too much to overcome: an interception in the end zone, an inability to stop a long drive and a fumble that led to a touchdown.

You always have to look ahead to the next game - this time against Atlantic Coast Conference member Maryland, especially after a loss. 

But you have to wonder if the Golden Panthers, going up against arguably their most difficult opponent they have faced up to date, will commit critical mistakes that Maryland can capitalize on.

We'll find out Sept. 23 in College Park, Md.

Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Days after head coach Karl Kremser questioned their tenacity, the men's soccer team responded with a 2-0 victory over Central Connecticut State Sept. 17. 

Kremser criticized his players after a bitter defeat to No. 18 Illinois-Chicago two days prior, but FIU (3-3-2) rebounded, thanks to goals from senior forward David Hope and freshman defender Sina Ebrahimi. 

"Central Connecticut isn't on the level of some of the other teams we've faced, but I'll take the win because this is the fourth game we've played in eight days," Kremser said.

FIU showed no signs of fatigue, out-shooting CCSU (4-2-1) 17 to 14. 

The Golden Panthers struck first when Blue Devils goalkeeper Paul Armstrong lost control of a shot by defender Chris Handy. Hope quickly tapped in the loose ball to give FIU a 1-0 lead.

A 20-yard blast from Ebrahimi in the 71st minute made the score 2-0. Following a corner-kick build-up, Ebrahimi controlled a deflected ball and fired a curving shot that ricocheted off the right goalpost to secure a win.

Goalkeepers Shawn Crowe and Kyle Thomas combined to record FIU's third shut-out of the season. 

Kremser said that Thomas, who had four saves in the match, replaced Crowe at the half in order to gain experience.

"We wanted to get Kyle some game time in case something happened to Shawn," Kremser said. "He hasn't played in a while but he made two great back-to-back saves, was confident in goal and played quite well."

A yellow-card foul inside the penalty area was Thomas' lone blemish of the match, but he managed to save forward Alex Harrison's penalty kick and the follow-up shot by defender Peter Howe.

"I could read what the kick-taker was doing and knew he was going to pull it to the left," Thomas said. "I was happy that I made the save, but then I realized, 'Oh, man, I have to save it again.'"

FIU returns to the field Sept. 23 to face Wisconsin-Milwaukee.



UIC 1, FIU 0



After defender Mike Giffin received a red card in the 69th minute for kicking sophomore forward Levi Coleman, FIU seemed poised to upset No. 18 Illinois-Chicago Sept. 15.

But less than a minute later, Crowe committed a costly foul that led to a penalty kick goal and a 1-0 loss to UIC (6-0-2) at FIU Soccer Stadium.

As he dove to secure a loose ball inside the penalty area, Crowe bumped UIC midfielder Pavle Dundjer. 

Forward Tonci Skroce then converted the penalty kick with a powerful shot sent low and to the left.

Though the Flames played with only 10 men for the remainder of the match, the Golden Panthers couldn't equalize. 

"It didn't seem like we had the extra man; they were taking it to us," Kremser said. "I can't believe with a Top 20 team on our home field, we gave them a goal and didn't push up to answer."

FIU nearly equalized in the 71st minute, but a UIC defender blocked Coleman's header attempt directly in front of goal. The same happened to Hope's shot seconds later. 

The Golden Panthers took five other shots in the second half - none of which were on target. Attempts from Hope and junior midfielders Dadi Kristjánsson and Edgard Corrêa all went high or wide.

Even with a one-man disadvantage, UIC took two shots and frequently threatened to score. Kremser was visibly upset by the Flames' ability to attack.

"We didn't hustle and we didn't make them work," he said. "There was no fire, no intensity and no emotion. This is a game that we could have won, should have won and we didn't step up."

Headline: Careless mistakes overshadow potential on special teams
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers need to change the name of their special teams unit because their play has been anything but special.

Although special teams play has shown sparks of brilliance, many of those spectacular returns have been overshadowed by a slew of mistakes.

"We made too many mistakes," head Coach Don Strock said at the postgame press conference. "You make that many mistakes and you're not going to win."

Heading into the fourth game of the season against the Maryland Terrapins, FIU has missed two extra points, given up two punt returns for touchdowns, missed a field goal and fumbled a punt return that resulted in a touchdown.

"It's disappointing because we talked about these different areas. Making plays on special teams and we did on several instances. And then we gave them a freebee," Strock said.

One of the many freebies Strock was referring to came in the second quarter when senior wide receiver Chandler Williams fumbled a kickoff return when he was hit by Bowling Green junior linebacker Jacob Hardwick. Not only did they recover the fumble, but they returned it for a touchdown.

Williams didn't return another kick or punt until the fourth quarter and he didn't seem to learn his lesson when he returned to catch a punt return on FIU's final drive. Instead of allowing the punt to roll into the end zone, he attempted to field the punt at the 2-yard line and pull out at the last minute. BG defenders pounced on the ball after it appeared to have touched, but officials ruled BG illegally touched the ball. 

"It's the same thing I tell the team all the time, 'You take care of the little things and the big things will take care of themselves,' and right now, we're not fine tuning the little things as much as we should be and I'll take the responsibility for that," Strock said. "You can bet they'll be fine tuned this week."

Strock already made one change before the BG game by electing to start redshirt freshman kicker Dustin Rivest over senior Chris Patullo.

Strock said that both kickers were charted during practice before the game and the competition was fairly close. 

"We just felt it was time to give an opportunity Dustin and he made extra points.He hasn't made a field goal, though. Let's not get all giddy here."

But students and fans were giddy for the play of junior cornerback Lionell Singleton who had two interceptions and a 99-yard kick off return for a touchdown that tied the school record held by Gregg Moss who set it on Sept. 27, 2003 against Carson Newman. 

The kickoff return was the first score FIU has earned all season. Down 23-14 at half, Singleton's return opened the second half off player and cut the deficit to three.

Despite the impressive performance, Singleton said it didn't matter because the team still lost. 

And the rest of the team agrees with Singleton. Many players are getting tired of the losses and hope to end the skid this weekend in Maryland. 

Senior linebacker Keyonvis Bouie voiced his displeasure in losing to opponents he feels the Golden Panthers shouldn't be losing to. 

"Everybody knows it's us beating ourselves and not the other team," Bouie said.

Subheadline: Golden Panthers neglect numerous opportunities to take win
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers hoped to end a two-game skid when they opened their home schedule Sept. 16, but what they ended up with was another loss by less than a touchdown.  Their limiting factos?  Inexperience and a lack of depth.

FIU (0-3, 0-1) lost yet another heartbreaker, this time a 33-28 loss at the hands of visiting Bowling Green (2-1) at FIU Stadium as the Golden Panther defense was unable to make up for a faltering offense and was worn down for the second week in a row by facing a spread offense. 

Despite the revival of the running game, with sophomore A'mod Ned's 169 yards on 16 carries, poor decisions by senior quarterback Josh Padrick were the difference in FIU's five point loss. 

Padrick, 16-of-27 passing for 153 yards, was unable to find the end zone while throwing three devastating interceptions. 

"We made too many mistakes," said coach Don Strock following the loss at the postgame news conference. "You make that many mistakes and you're not going to win."

Despite giving up a season-high 33 points, the Golden Panther defense kept FIU in the game with plenty of chances to win. 

Senior strong safety Chris Smith ended the night with a game-high 12 solo tackles including three tackles for a loss. 

Linebacker Keyonvis Bouie added 11, while Antwan Barnes, sackless for the second game in a row, managed eight tackles. 

In spite of FIU's turnovers, their final two drives saw them with a chance to win the game. With 3:03 left to play, the Golden Panthers had a shot at putting their demons at bay.  

Following a three-yard loss, Padrick rolled out to his left as he faced severe pressure from the Falcon defense. With wide receiver Ashyln Parker open for close to a first down near the 35-yard line, Padrick fired into triple coverage as he attempted to find Chandler Williams. He was intercepted by Jerrett Sanderson at the FIU 41 on what seemed to be the Golden Panthers' last offensive attack of the game. 

The tired defense marched onto the field and forced a three-and-out and a punt from BGSU's Alonso Rojas. 

Following a confusing play that saw an illegal touching penalty called on the Falcons and the ball trickle off Williams' hands and into the end zone, the Golden Panthers started out from their own 20 yard line with 1:07 to play. 

The senior from Merritt Island completed four-of-six passes, driving Strock's men down to the Bowling Green 40 yard line.

With 11 seconds to play and needing a shot at the end zone, the senior once again fired into triple coverage as he overthrew Williams in the end zone. His pass was intercepted by Sanderson for the second time, thus ending the threat and consequently the game. 

"It's discouraging to lose a game like that," Strock said. "We had to stop them and we couldn't. We had to make plays and we couldn't protect and that's basically what the game's all about."

FIU's defense got off to a slow start as they seemed ill prepared to stop the spread offense.

Working with two quarterbacks, Bowling Green managed to roll down the field on their opening drive and score when sophomore Anthony Turner connected with backup quarterback and freshman Freddie Barnes for a three-yard touchdown. With reminders from FIU's last two losses, BGSU's freshman kicker Sean Ellis missed the extra-point giving the visitors a 6-0 lead. 

FIU bounced back two drives later taking the lead 7-6 as on the first play of the drive Ned took Padrick's handoff to the left and  quickly cut to the right and broke the Falcons defense for an 80-yard score. 

Following the kickoff, the Golden Panthers had a chance to take the game's momentum as defensive back Marshall McDuffie Jr. intercepted Turner on the very first play of the drive, giving FIU the ball back with a chance to score.

On the second play of the drive, Padrick looked for Williams in the corner of the end zone but the pass was under-thrown and intercepted by Falcons freshman Vincent Corner, ending the Golden Panthers' momentum, handing the game back to the visitors. 

"I tell the team all the time," Strock said. "You take care of the little things and the big things will take care of themselves and right now, we're not fine tuning the little things as much as we should be and I'll take the responsibility for that."

The Falcons took advantage and scored two quick touchdowns. Barnes found tight end Sean O'Dronbinak for a three-yard touchdown and on the ensuing kickoff Chandler Williams brought the ball out from five yards deep only to be hit at the 9-yard line. 

Sanderson scooped up the ball and walked into the end zone putting the away team up 20-7. 

Sophomore running back Julian Reams brought the lead down to six on a one-yard run that ended a 14-play 73-yard drive that spanned less than three minutes.

As time expired in the half, the Falcons had a 9-point lead heading into the locker room after kicker Sean Ellis connected from 38 yards to make it a 23-14 game. 

The Golden Panthers showed heart after the half, quickly bouncing back and cutting the lead to two, thanks to a 98-yard opening kickoff return by Lionell Singleton. 

Singleton was positive following the disappointing start to the season. 

"We've been in this thing working hard every week [day in] and day out coming up short every time, so it's like we're going through the same thing over and over," said Singleton. "We just need to get over that hump and come up with a victory."

With the score in Bowling Green's favor, 23-21, Barnes once again extended the lead on a 7-yard touchdown run four minutes into the fourth quarter as the game appeared to be out of the reach of the home side. 

Reams' second touchdown of the game with 9:02 left from six yards out showed that the Golden Panthers still had a fight left in them scoring quickly on a four-play, 69-yard drive, thanks in part to a 47-yard connection between Padrick and Ned. 

Ellis connected on his second field goal of the night with 3:03 remaining leaving the score as it would finish 33-24. 

The Golden Panthers will look for their first win of the season on the road Sept. 23 against Atlantic Coast Conference member Maryland at Byrd Stadium in College Park, Md.

Subheadline: SGA should obey its constitution
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In its September 16 issue, The Beacon reported that the University Park Student Government Association is recruiting members for two ad-hoc committees - the Student Health Advisory Committee and the Technology Committee - that technically do not exist. They also undermined a democratic vote and advanced the Campus Life chairperson to a cabinet position. Both incidents violated the SGA Constitution.

The function of a constitution is to delegate power to a government in a way consistent with certain established structures and procedures defined by a basic law. Sustaining a functional relationship between a government and those it serves depends on an adequate distribution of power and organization of responsibilities. 

When a government violates its constitution, it loses the capacity to exercise its power in service of the community. 

Fortunately, the SGA infractions reported by The Beacon were minor. The unlawful perpetuation of two ad-hoc committees is not the stuff that brings down governments. This time around, nobody was hurt.

However, the issue at stake is not the magnitude of SGA's violations, but rather that SGA acted unconstitutionally at all. 

Democratic government, by nature, contains bureaucracy. When an administration's activities obey its own laws, bureaucracy is simply a necessary feature of governmental activity. 

By organizing its committees in violation of its constitution, SGA runs the risk of entangling itself in a mess of bylaws, loopholes and exceptions. By sticking to its rules, SGA can avoid complications and ensure that its activities run smoothly.

Moreover, organization is the foundation for transparency. If SGA begins to re-arrange its committees at will, it will be at the cost of compromising its efficiency. The question today is, "Where did those committees come from?" If student government allows itself to become disorganized, the question tomorrow could very well become, "Where did that money go?"

Of the two violations, changing the Campus Life chairperson position to a cabinet position is the more ethically volatile. 

The SGA bylaws state in Section 5, Part B: "Committee chairpersons will be chosen through an application process and appointed by a simple majority vote of the entire SGA." 

Making the Campus Life leadership a cabinet position allowed SGA to circumvent the application process for the chair position. 

SGA President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon and SGA Vice-President Providence Okoye have not announced the reason for the change. Whatever their intentions, actions like this carry the danger of opening the door to favoritism, conflicts of interest and other ethical transgressions.

A position in student government is prestigious. In a university with more than 37,000 students, a place in student government is also a position of power. 

If the microcosm of FIU student government reflects the political macrocosm of the real world, SGA might do well to learn from the mistakes of the latter. Minor transgressions like these have ruined the careers of successful politicians.

If it wishes to maintain the respect and goodwill of the student body and successfully serve the FIU community, SGA must abide by its constitution and correct its mistakes, or else be held accountable for any past, present and future constitutional violations.

Subheadline: Consensus does exist on global warming threat
Author:  John H. Parker / Environmental Studies
&nbsp;
The recent article by Jessica Garcia-Iniguez, "Some Like It Cold," shows a lack of understanding of the science of climate change. Her claim that there was a consensus that "global cooling was the imminent climatic threat in the 1970s" is a myth. At that time, scientists were trying to determine the relative importance of cooling by aerosol emissions from burning coal and warming due to increased greenhouse gas emissions, but there was no scientific consensus. Advanced computer modeling and thousands of experiments have now convinced almost all climate-change scientists that the warming of the last 35 years is due predominantly to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases. These computer models incorporate aerosol cooling as well as changes in solar radiation in their models but show the earth warming by about 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. Many environmental scientists believe that global warming will be the most serious environmental problem of this century.

Headline: SOC point system burdens smaller and newer clubs
Author: Shawn M. Sprockett
&nbsp;
Repeat these words after me: All clubs are not created equal.

No, I don't mean that smokey dance floor where you're out 'til 4 a.m. getting drunk and abandoned by your friends.

I mean the student clubs here on campus. You know the ones that put on all those events you never attend? Or the ones that keep sending you reminders of meetings, when you can't remember how they got your contact information in the first place?

There are more than 37,000 students here at FIU. And of those 37,000 individuals, there are 126 student-run clubs. All of these clubs fall under FIU's very own Student Organizations Council. Impressed? You shouldn't be. The council's primary function is to provide clubs with limited funding if the clubs meet the demands of the infamous "point system."

What does the point system demand, you ask? Basically that clubs attend four general meetings; hold their own monthly meetings; record the events of those meetings; check their mailboxes every month; attend leadership seminars; complete five special projects; complete three community service projects; attend two athletic events; attend two fine art events and create a club table for the Club Fair each semester.

If the clubs survive, they are then awarded a measly $200 budget, which can only be spent at certain businesses that the school deems worthy.

Now, I think clubs should help support events on campus. I also think clubs should get money from their student government. 

But here's the problem: this point system applies the same to all members. The clubs that have been around for more than 35 years with more than 100 members are held to the same standard as young clubs that are just starting out. It's not fair to demand that a fledgling club of 10 meet the same standards as a club of 100. They don't have comparable resources, manpower or experience. So why are they being measured on the same scale?

More importantly, how do we fix it? With a better point system, of course. What SOC should do is build a system that categorizes the clubs into three classes. The largest and most popular clubs would belong to the first class and receive larger budgets and greater responsibility to help promote events on campus. The second class would be for medium-sized clubs and the third would be for new clubs that are still spending most of their time trying to get their ideas off the ground. The smaller clubs would have the smallest budget, but the fewest number of responsibilities, too, which would also allow them to focus on expanding.

Over the past year, several new clubs, including China Care and the Bolivarian Youth, have been struggling to pull in new members, accomplish their goals as a club, and maintain status in SOC. The clubs' struggles have been compounded by the lack of sympathy they have received from the overly demanding SOC. The clubs' aim to spread awareness about human rights issues that could potentially save lives, but their goals became hard to realize as they battled the many regulations of the point system. 

Among some of the clubs' conflicts was a failure to attend last semester's SOC Night. SOC Night is one of the many requirements for the point system and was chosen by the SOC President Larissa Lockett. What event was chosen as SOC night last semester? Lockett's very own music recital. What a coincidence! You're telling me that human rights groups couldn't get out their message because of an event which glorified the president's own musical ambitions?

Things need to start changing on campus. SOC needs to understand that clubs cannot survive under the current conditions that they face and that some clubs are truly working for good causes out there. If FIU is to keep any students involved on campus they will need to apply this simple phrase to the SOC: all clubs are not created equal.

Headline: Government neglects 9/11 heroes
Author: Roque Corona / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The tragedy of 9/11 was an event that demonstrated the heroism and courage of the American people.  On that day and the weeks following, we saw people from all around the nation come together and help in the recovery efforts at the World Trade Center site.  Now, more than five years after the attacks, these brave souls face serious repercussions from laboring in the toxic dust that filled the air in lower Manhattan.

The pulverized concrete that saturated the air for days after the attacks has gradually led to serious lung and cardiovascular disorders in many of the 9/11 responders.  "World Trade Center cough," as it has come to be known, now affects nearly 70 percent of the workers who responded to the attacks on the World Trade Center.

According to medical examinations conducted between July 2002 and April 2004, about 40,000 rescue and recovery workers - including construction workers, police officers, and firefighters - were exposed to pollutants in the dust that emerged from the collapsed buildings. And according to researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center, the people who had worked on cleanup and recovery had twice the rate of pulmonary abnormalities as the general population.

Mount Sinai's findings reported that of the responders who had been treated in the past year, 47 percent have had lower-respiratory disorders such as asthma and "World Trade Center cough;" 84 percent have had upper-respiratory illness such as sinusitis, laryngitis and vocal cord dysfunction; and 31 percent have had musculoskeletal problems.

Even more alarming, of the workers who showed no severe symptoms before 9/11, 61 percent developed respiratory problems while working at the recovery site, and almost 60 percent had new or worsened respiratory problems.

Unfortunately, government response has been inadequate and long overdue for the many stricken ill and those worried about becoming sick. Officials have stalled, arguing that connecting the smoke and dust to particular symptoms and diseases is difficult and requires extensive testing.  

Even if, by a slight chance, the various ailments that the thousands of 9/11 workers have only recently acquired turns out to be completely unrelated to the dust, the government should still fund the medical testing to determine such information.

While some rescue and recovery workers have been covered by their own health insurance, such coverage may become insufficient in the years to come.  

The federal government bears the undeniable responsibility of providing assistance for these people, especially considering the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2003 that White House officials pressured the agency to hastily assure the public that the air was safe to breathe a week after the World Trade Center collapse.

This deception of the public is reason alone for the federal government to provide financial assistance to the responders.  Unfortunately, there are still politicians who refuse to help.

Senate Republicans recently rejected an amendment proposed by Sen. Hillary Clinton to provide $2 billion in medical and mental health monitoring and treatment. The amendment would have granted $5,800 a year for five years for each person sickened from Ground Zero exposure.  

"Their country should answer their calls for help," Clinton said in the New York Daily News.  Other, more opportunistic politicians rushed to pose with the 9/11 workers in order to gain a few votes, but now deny assistance to them and even raise doubts about their health claims.

Luckily, people like Senator Clinton and Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City stand for the right ideals.  On Sept. 5, Mayor Bloomberg announced the establishment of the WTC Enivironmental Health Center, which would aim to provide assistance to the men and women who responded in the days following 9/11. In a press release, Bloomberg was quoted as saying, "We will never abandon those who gave heroically during those difficult days."

This is the sort of sentiment that all politicians should follow, for only they can grant the necessary medical funds to assist the thousands of workers who participated in the recovery efforts at the World Trade Center.  New York City cannot handle all the medical expenses on its own.  9/11 was a national crisis, and those who responded to the tragedy deserve national attention. The federal government must act now and respond to the calls of those who so bravely rushed to the smoldering remains of the fallen Twin Towers.

Subheadline: An FIU student relates her experience living in Israel during the conflict with Hezbollah
Author: Rina Lankry / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This summer, I went to Israel for five weeks through an on-campus Jewish organization called Collegiate Learning Exchange to study the Jewish religion in Jerusalem. 

Weeks after my arrival, the war between Israel and Lebanon started. Most people would have rushed to leave a country under fire, but instead I decided to extend my stay in Israel to four months. 

Even before the war began, I was well aware of the dangers of living in Israel. People warned me to not take buses or go to central areas that had restaurants and cafes, because these are common terrorist targets. 

Those warnings did not hold me back, though. 

I couldn't afford to take cabs everywhere and I couldn't stay in school all the time, so I took buses anyway. 

My favorite hang out in Jerusalem was Kikar Zion - the hub of activity for all young people. One of the things I started to notice were the signs on some of the shops and restaurants that commemorated the innocent victims of terrorist attacks in these spots. There were also security guards with their dogs at each of the bus stops to make sure no terrorists got on. 

When I walked the streets and saw so many young men and women in their soldier uniforms carrying huge guns around their shoulders as if they were backpacks, it seemed like life as usual. They had no choice but to fight and defend their people.

In the beginning of my stay in Jerusalem, seeing these things really frightened me. Over time, though, I got used to it, just like everyone else around me. 

North of Jerusalem was Safed. It lies among mountains, with quiet alleyways and an old city charm. It has many artists and a history of mystics who lived there. The city exudes an atmosphere of deep peacefulness and spirituality. 

Upon my return to Jerusalem, I decided I would return to Safed the following week. When I told my mom, she got very upset. "Are you crazy? Don't you watch the news over there?" she said. I was clueless.

Hezbollah had just fired katyusha rockets into Safed and other northern cities that week and people were wounded and beginning to evacuate their homes. I couldn't believe it. It was hard for me to imagine Safed under attack. The place that I felt was like heaven on earth was now a war zone. 

As the tension and rocket attacks continued, my family and friends back home became increasingly worried about me. My mom would call me everyday, frantic from seeing images of the conflict on CNN; she would update me on the news and make sure I was being safe. Every conversation would end with "When are you coming home?"

Flights to America were selling out. People desperate to return were stuck in Israel because there were no seats available.

I decided to stay where I was. I was feeling fine, just like everyone else around me. Jerusalem was calm and out of harm's reach. If I hadn't watched the news, I would have had no idea that there was a war going on. 

I later began an internship with an online news channel based in Jerusalem, which forced us to be in touch with the news everyday. Half the staff from the office was recruited to serve in Lebanon. 

As disturbing as it was, there was still a sense among everyone that this was a war that needed to be fought, because Israel had the right to defend itself.

Since I've been back at FIU, continuing my studies, I think of my summer in Israel and feel grateful to have had that experience. It helped me understand how people can live their lives normally, even under the constant shadow of terror. It made me realize that, since 9/11, America is not so different from Israel. 

The threat of terrorism is just as real here as it is in Israel. We can learn from the Israelis the power of human resilience - to experience fear, war, suffering and loss and still move forward in our lives.

&nbsp;
The Steven & Dorthea Green Critics Lecture Series welcomed culture critic and scholar Camille Paglia as its first speaker of the season Sept. 15.

The lecture, organized by the Patricia and Philip Frost Art Museum, also introduced the museum's newest exhibit, "A Room of One's Own: Terisita Fernández, Maria Elena González, Quisqueyá Henriquez and María Martínez-Cañas."

"We have an exhibit of four women artists that have really been pioneering in their field," said museum curator Elizabeth Cerejido. "So the programming that complements the lecture reflects that."

Dahlia Morgan, the museum's director emerita, elaborated.

"The staff thought [Paglia] would be a good choice [to give the lecture] and suggested her," she said. "Paglia is known as a feminist, and she is of the stature and fame of the [Green Lecture] Series, so she's on that top level as an intellectual and scholar, and she fits the theme of the exhibition."

The exhibit takes its title from Virginia Woolf's classic book, building upon its theme that to create art a woman needs both space and money. Each artist in the exhibit manipulated types of space in her own installation room through video, sculpture and other means.

Paglia created her lecture to address the idea of space and rooms throughout art history, from the prehistoric cave paintings of Lascaux to modernist sculptor Henry Moore. 

The talk, aided by impromptu slides, was punctuated with Paglia's humor.

"God Lord! It looks like a vampire movie," she said, as Piero della Francesca's "Madonna of Mercy" appeared on the screen. "Can't you ever escape the power of the Mother?"

The fifteenth century painting shows the mother of Jesus sheltering her followers in her wing-like mantle.

Though the lecture began in the Green Library Auditorium at 8 p.m. with standing room only, some left as the hour progressed. However, most of the audience stayed throughout, laughing with Paglia and paying close attention.

"[Paglia is] very intelligent," said junior Izlia Fernandez after the lecture. "She made history interesting by adding humor to it."

Junior Dixon Gutierrez agreed.

"I thought it was interesting in that every different thing [Paglia] spoke about you could see how it evolved as time went along," he said. "I didn't really know what to expect when I came here, but I'm glad I went."

Paglia - currently a professor of media studies and humanities at University of the Arts in Philadelphia - participated in a book signing after the lecture. The author took time joking and recounting anecdotes about her writing with each person in the line, seemingly unaware of the winding queue.

"This is a museum, and I support museums," she said at the signing. "There's this whole cultural heritage of art, and the museum is the citadel of it. I feel like I'm a crusader for the fine arts."

Headline: Law panel reviews Constitution's importance
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
Sophomore Madeline Garcia admitted to never being interested in politics until she started college. That's why she was interested in attending the Judicial Independence discussion forum.

"I wanted to be more informed in regards to the judicial process," Garcia said.

The Judicial Independence forum, organized by the FIU College of Law, was held Sept. 18 in the Graham Center Ballroom in celebration of Constitution Day.

Even though there were 100 seats available at the event, only about 20 were filled, mostly by law students.

The forum began with Leonard P. Strickman, Dean of the College of Law, welcoming everyone to the event and talking briefly about Constitution Day and its reason for being created by Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor. 

This was followed by a DVD presentation, "Conversation on the Constitution: Judicial Independence," which featured a discussion between high school students from California and Pennsylvania and Justices O'Connor, Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy. 

After the DVD, there was a discussion panel that featured College of Law professors Elizabeth Foley, Thomas Baker and Howard Wasserman, as well as the Honorable Adalberto Jordan, United States District Judge, Southern District of Florida. 

According to Strickman, the subject of this project, judicial independence, was proposed by O'Connor because "judiciary has been under assault by some members of Congress who want the courts to decide cases as Congress would wish them to."  

The DVD discussed the separation of powers among the three branches of government, why an independent judiciary is needed and how the Constitution safeguards the role of judges so they can safeguard the rights of minorities, as well as those who have unpopular views.

Jordan said that the term "judicial independence" was difficult to define, but said that it's basically "the ability of the judiciary to make decisions without undue pressure or influences from other branches." 

Jordan also mentioned that it was an important topic to discuss.

"The more the public gets involved and the more information we get out to the public, the better the citizenry can challenge it," he said.

Wasserman stressed clarifying this definition and understanding it.

 "We definitely have to come up with a mutual definition of what judicial independence is. The question is: how do we come up with an understanding of judicial independence?"

In the DVD, O'Connor pointed out that the job of the judiciary is "to carry out its duties in ways that are fair and impartial."

"If you go back and look at what the Constitution is trying to do is prevent the tyrannizing of the minority by the majority," she said in the film.

Kennedy went on to say that the Constitution works only with the participation of citizens.

"I don't care how exquisite it is on paper," he said. "The Constitution is not automatic. It runs because you believe in it, you understand it."

Wasserman said that the U.S. government was really just a "happy accident" due to the country's geographical isolation and the revolutionary ideals of the time.

"We were separated from the world. We were left to develop ourselves. We were given the chance to develop where other countries are not given that chance," he said.

Foley, on the other hand, expressed concern about today's government and what it has become.

"One of the reasons for the creation of the government was to prevent a British leviathan government with an unchecked parliamentary system," she said, referring to Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. "I think we've gotten to that point today."

Senior Adrian Bispham had hoped to learn more about the Constitution and judicial independence, as well as to hear new things on the topic that he hadn't heard before.

"I feel that I got that, as well as some great opinions from the panelists," he said. "It clarified a lot of points for me, like the actual day-to-day thought process of a judge. Sometimes it seems like just a formula, but in reality, like Jordan was saying, they just take the case that's in front of them and ... sometimes they're right, and sometimes they're wrong."

U.S. Government stepping up immigration process

Federal officials said they are committing to President Bush's goal of processing immigration applications faster, but that's mostly because they are no longer counting many stalled applications as part of the jam.

Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Homeland Security Department, Emilio Gonzalez reported Sept. 15 that as of July 31 there was a backlog of about 139,000 applications from immigrants seeking everything from legal residency to work permits.

However, the latest figure excludes nearly 1 million applications not completed because of circumstances the agency says are outside its control.

The agency said that if all applications were counted, the July 31 total would be 1.12 million, down from 3.8 million in January 2004.


WORLD:
AP Photographer accused of being security threat

The U.S. military in Iraq has had an Associated Press photographer in custody since April. 

The military is accusing him of being a security threat but has never filed charges against him or permitted a public hearing.

Military officials say Bilal Hussein, an Iraqi citizen, was being held for "imperative reasons of security" under United Nations resolutions. 

AP executives say the news cooperative's review of Hussein's work did not find any inappropriate contact with insurgents and any evidence against him should be brought to the Iraqi criminal justice system.

The 35 -year- old is a native of Fallujah and began work for the AP two years ago. He photographed events in Fallujah and Ramadi until he was detained earlier this year.

The Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision finding that Asahara was competent to face justice.

Asahara's defense team had argued he was mentally unstable and did not understand the proceedings against him.

Headline: College Democrats encourage political activism
Author: Martha Castillo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With elections just around the corner, exercising democracy is one of Mark Romero's main goals.

 As the president of the FIU College Democrats Club, he wants to increase political awareness. 

In an effort to get students interested in the political process, Romero and the FIU College Democrats promote the values of the Democratic Party.

Their main goal is to encourage students to get involved in political activities. 

"Despite the fact that we are trying to further the presence of the Democratic Party on our school, we've been trying to be as neutral as possible," Romero said. "So despite the fact that we're Democrats, our main goal is to simply increase political activism."

For Romero, recruiting members has been a challenge during the past year. Romero was even told by a political science professor that today's students aren't interested in democracy.

"I was told ,'Even political science majors at FIU are not interested in politics; most of them are just using it as a stepping-stone for Law School,'" Romero said. 

It's attitudes like these that create a weak Republican Party presence on campus, according to Romero. 

Unlike other universities, FIU does not have a College Republicans Club.

"I find this is a sad predicament and truly, it doesn't matter if students are Republicans or if they're Democrats," Romero said. "Political activism is extremely important." 

Another problem that the FIU College Democrats face is the amount of members they have each semester. 

The number of club members tends to increase in years of major elections and drop tremendously in years where there are no major elections.

 In an attempt to increase their numbers, the Democrats brought Democratic leader Howard Dean to speak on campus last February, according to Romero. Dean discussed U.S. foreign policy issues concerning Latin America. 

They also coordinated a recent debate for Florida gubernatorial Democrat candidate Jim Davis and a visit from Miami-Dade County Commissioner Katy Sorenson, according to Romero.

Next month, the Democrats are scheduled to bring CIA Analyst Ray McGovern to the University Park campus. He is scheduled to visit Oct. 8 at 12 p.m. where he is expected to discuss issues pertaining to the war in Iraq. 

Students will be able to participate in a debate concerning the war and engage a panel consisting of a group of students for and against the war.

 "There seems to be a vacuum of pro-American political activism here. The Republicans don't seem concerned enough to show that they care for matters at this school, so we are here to show that we are concerned about them," said Pedro Ross, the organization's secretary.

Ross said the FIU College Democrats would like students to understand how the country's political stance relates to the world, whether it involves issues concerning city planning and affordable housing to larger issues in the world such as global warming or human rights abuses.

"These are some of the typical issues that the Democratic Party normally espouses," Ross said.

The organization meets every Monday at 8 p.m. in the Graham Center, room 140, to talk politics and watch politically charged movies such as "City of God," "The Killing Fields" and "Good Bye, Lenin!"

"We try not to play things with a right winged or left winged orientation such as 'Fahrenheit 9/11'," Romero said. 

Distressed by the lack of political movement on campus, sophomore Maria Soledad Fernandez stated that she would like to see more political activities.

 "I see more associations recruiting students to join sororities than political campaigns encouraging student[s] to vote," Fernandez said.

As coordinator of special events and advisor for the FIU College Democrats, Jack Parker is concerned with the gubernatorial elections Nov. 7.

He says that the FIU College Democrats will be doing everything possible to get more students involved in voting.

The deadline to register for the Nov. 7 election is Oct. 10.

"To encourage students to vote this coming November, the FIU College Democrats will be conducting different types of political activities on campus this coming October," Parker said.

He added that some of the activities may include public speakers such as Jim Davis.

The FIU College Democrats are a member of the Student Organizations Council at FIU.

Students interested in the FIU College Democrats may contact College Democrats president Mark Romero at 954-559-1254 or at Mrome014@fiu.edu.

Headline: Research VP confronts many faculty concerns
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
George Walker, the new vice president for research and dean of the Graduate School, has been hard at work meeting with University officials and learning about the research needs of the University since Sept. 11, his first day on the job.

Walker, 65-years-old, is a renowned physicist who has served in a variety of roles, including professor, researcher, administrator and dean.

He has received a warm welcome from University administrators who see a great deal of promise in him.

Acting Provost and Executive Vice President Ronald Berkman recently said in a press release, "We're all looking forward to this new chapter in FIU history."

Among other goals, Walker is interested in creating undergraduate research opportunities, expanding on existing research projects, developing a research relationship with the new School of Medicine and improving the quality of the faculty and students that FIU attracts.

Walker credits his academic experiences-beginning at the undergraduate level-for his passion in research, and hopes that he can facilitate a similar experience for FIU students.

"When you know you're the first person to learn something, there's a high involvement in that, and you'll want to do it again," said Walker. "That's the kind of experience I want to make sure students here have."

Senior Tiffany Brannon agrees.

"Involvement in research has shaped my scholastic maturity, and it has allowed me to have a more well-rounded learning experience that extends beyond the classroom and text," Brannon said.

Undergraduate research opportunities are currently limited.

The Honors College Student Research and Artistic Initiative (SRAI) and the psychology department's Psychology Research Initiatives Mentorship Experience (PRIME) are two successful examples, but as Brannon points out, "there is opportunity and need for growth."

Professor Grenville Draper of the earth sciences department echoed an equal need for change.

Draper, who specializes in the geology of the northern Caribbean and is currently researching high-pressure rocks and tectonic mélange in Hispaniola, feels that FIU could provide more support to professors. 

"I feel that for a Ph. D. granting institution our expected teaching load is too high. There seems to be an attitude that our time is infinitely expandable… and some colleagues have even been discouraged from performing research because of the lack of support we get with grants," Draper said.

This results in an increasing number of professors handling accounting and other paperwork that the University mandates, instead of a support staff in order to ensure that grants are administered properly. 

Walker acknowledged the problem and said he is ready to tackle it, along with any other concerns.

"When I was a professor, I remember being suspicious of the administration … today my experience gives me a perspective. There are always many legitimate needs-there may not be enough parking, enough housing for students or high enough salaries-but it is difficult to get the kind of support needed for education, and ultimately what you need is balance," Walker said. "I think of my job as a steward and hope our efforts would be, as a community, to use our resources fairly." 

Another concern Draper voiced was that developing the new School of Medicine would draw resources away from other projects.

"Medicine both attracts and soaks up a lot of money. Many of the rest of us feel we'll get overlooked in this rush for the medical school. We might get shortchanged," Draper said.

Walker was also responsive to this fear.

"Any time there's a new child in the family, you rejoice in the new child and the other children start worrying." 

However, he believes other departments will eventually benefit as the School of Medicine garners greater prestige for the University, making it possible for other areas to compete even more for outside grants.

Professors and undergraduate students are not the only groups who want to see improvements.

Graduate students also have research concerns.

Graduate student Rui Duan, of the dietetics and nutrition department, has three friends who were once graduate assistants at FIU like himself but decided to transfer to other universities. 

"As far as I know, they felt that FIU couldn't support them with a good platform to do their dissertation research, and at the same time, their department assigned them a lot of teaching assistant work, even teaching as instructors in some undergraduate courses," said Duan. "I know at some universities like the University of Miami … the Ph. D. students don't need to be [teaching assistants]." 

In order to achieve the established objectives, Walker will have to consider the obstacles FIU's research goals currently face.

However, he is optimistic and welcomes input from the University community.

"At this stage, I'm not in this to build an empire, but to help out. I'm 'Grandpa Walker,' and I mean to get things right. If I don't, I just need people to be straightforward and steer me in the right direction," he said. "We must remember we are here for the students."

Headline: New Vice-Provost fills big shoes
Author: Cristela Guerra / BBC Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Professor Damian Fernandez of the Department of International Relations was chosen as the interim vice-provost for FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus on Sept. 19.   

Fernandez is replacing Raul Moncarz who served in the position for nine years and retired this summer. 

Acting Provost and Executive Vice President Provost Ronald Berkman formed a task force compiled of students, faculty members and deans who helped interview and choose the individual for the job.  

Fernandez headed up this task force with Rosa Jones, vice-president of Student Affairs and also has served as director of University Long Range Planning since 2005, overseeing various options for future University expansion and redevelopment.

Fernandez knows he has very large shoes to fill.

"I think [Moncarz] set the bar very high. I hope to be worthy of this opportunity," he said.

Although Berkman was not available for comment, he announced Fernandez's promotion through a University memo. 

In this memo, Berkman described the new position as "exciting and a challenge to revitalize FIU-Biscayne Bay [Campus]." 

Fernandez served as director of the Cuban Research Institute as well as a professor of international relations and is now enthusiastic about taking on a new role.

"I'm really excited about the challenge at BBC because there are so many opportunities to be creative with the programs," Fernandez said. "I cannot think of a better challenge because it allows for innovation with graduate and undergraduate interdisciplinary classes."

The task force discussed BBC reforms in a report reviewed over the summer.

Fernandez said he would follow the guidelines set in this report, which included "a vision for the campus within the parameters of 'one university' that would result in robust expansion."

Fernandez did mention that since housing at BBC was full this year, there was talk about eventually expanding housing facilities.

He also plans on bringing new classes as well as allowing deans to give their input for new programs.

"I'm a facilitator, but I hope ... we will be able to create a dynamic start to finish programs that would all be in [BBC]," Fernandez said.

Fernandez refers to start and finish programs since various departments have classes split between University Park and BBC, forcing many students to commute on a daily basis.

Fernandez cites various other goals for the campus.

Among these goals are to use eco-tourism to their advantage and to work on a global studies program with tracks that would eventually lead to connections with professional schools.

Although as Interim Vice-Provost, Fernandez admits he is to remain at the discretion of the provost, he hopes to be there at least a year to implement some of these ideas.

"We'll see after that amount of time when the provost and the president choose to begin a national search," he said.

Though many administrators have never worked directly with Fernandez, his credentials and experience speak for themselves.  

Fernandez came to FIU in 1988 with degrees from Princeton, the University of Miami and the University of Florida.

Many look forward to seeing continued advancement and improvement for BBC and believe Fernandez will benefit the campus as a whole.

"On this campus we need someone of authority. We do not need so much a figure head as we need leadership and authority in order for FIU to succeed," said Chris Brown, chairperson of the new School of Marine Biology.

Gregory Olsen, director of the Wolfe University Center, agreed. 

"We need leadership and Dr. Fernandez can give us that with his past experience. I am looking forward to working with him."

Other deans who have worked with Fernandez said they looked forward to seeing what he brings to the table.

"He'll bring a great deal of enthusiasm, and a lot of resources to the campus," said College of Arts and Sciences Associate Dean Joyce Peterson.

Peterson worked closely with Fernandez when he was a professor for the College of Arts and Sciences and then when he was chair of the Department of International Relations. 

"He'll work in developing academic resources as well as community relations," Petersom said.

In the legacy of Moncarz, Fernandez also emphasized the importance of community engagement with such a large outside population and classes offered for long-term residents of North Miami.

"Community engagement is a key to success. We want to interact our community with the North Miami community and continue communication with the elementary school as well as Biscayne Landings," Fernandez said.

Since both undergraduate and graduate students were represented as part of the task force with members of SGA and others, Fernandez looks forward to working on the "infrastructure" of campus life as well as additional courses and an overall strengthening of student services.

"This is a new area of possibility for BBC," he said. "I'll listen to what deans propose and embark on a path to re-energize commitment."

Headline: Comic books, trading cards can yield big bucks for collectors
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
Fads are like the weather: you never know what you are going to get from season to season. More often then not you end up with some kind of highly sought after doodad. These doodads sometimes manage to ensnare the attention and incomes of what seems like the whole world. But where are the doodads now? Did you sell them for a hefty mint, or are they gathering dust in the back of the closet?

 For many people growing up, the easiest things to collect were comic books. Comics, depending on the age and condition, can be worth a small fortune for a college student. Do an eBay search and you are sure to see many comics on sale for over $100.

For example, a copy of the first X-Men comic was sold for $405 when its original cost was 12 cents. You might find the first issue of Batman going for $8,600 -- with a few days left for bidding to go up. (The Buy-It-Now price was $13,500). Older comics tend to be valuable because their typical fate when they were originally printed was to either be thrown away or ravaged by their readers. Thus making the number of existing original copies in good condition very rare and valuable. 

"I used to collect comics. Mostly X-Men, but anything Marvel," said junior Rene Sanchez. "I passed them to my brother and my mother sold the rest at garage sales."

Comics can be very smart business if you know what your doing.

"I bought 800 Marvel shares of stock when I was 16 years old in high school," said Tate Ottati, owner of Tate's Comics at 4566 North University Drive in Lauderhill. "They started out at $16 a share, and I sold my 800 shares when they had reached about $40 a share."

In about two years time Ottati was able to make roughly $32,000 right out of high school. The funds helped him open his shop, Tate's Comics, which continues to expand and is one of the leading comic and collectables shop in South Florida.

Comics aren't the only things worth collecting. I mean, who can forget about baseball cards? While collecting them may have been really big in the 1950s, today cards from that era, and some from more recent times, are worth a mint. The 2001 Ultimate Collection, Ichiro Suzuki's card was going for $4,300 on eBay.

I must warn you though: Do not think that because baseball cards are worth so much that other trading cards will be. Take the infamous Pokemon trading card game. Just about everyone was taken in by them 10 years ago. Cards were going for hundreds of dollars.

"It was the thing to collect," said Senior Steven Hernandez. "I had the original set of Pokemon cards. I still have them actually."

Today, the Pokemon cards are barely worth the paper they were printed on. Guides say they are worth something, but when you look on eBay, most of them stay under a dollar in cost. Only the most rare ones are worth anything now. From my findings, those sell from $50 to $150 on eBay.

When you pay attention to the trading card craze, another card game has replaced Pokemon and it's called Yu-Gi-Oh.

In 2004 a special championship prize card was sold on eBay for over $25,000. At the time, there were only two "JC-EN001 Cyber-Stein" cards in existence. Which explains why the price went up so much on eBay. Yet a few months later the card was mass-produced, albeit with a different serial number.

The value of playable trading cards varies depending on how the popular the game is at the time. But most card games are fads, and when the fad ends, so does its value.

One fad also tends to replace the previous one in the world of collectables. Yu-Gi-Oh replaced Pokemon and Pokemon had replaced the cute and cuddly Beanie Babies.

"The first Beanie Baby I got was Bongo the Monkey," said freshman Tatiana Garcia. "By the time it was over with I had around 100 Beanie Babies."

"Glory the Bear was my most prized Beanie, but my favorite was the white dragon," said freshman Cristina Calderon.

For a while these miniature, stuffed animals were everywhere. The more collectable Bear Beanie Babies sold for hundreds of dollars. But they were hardly the first doll craze. Go back 25 years and you will see mothers spending the night in from of department stores waiting to buy a Cabbage Patch Doll.  

Collecting is a hobby for many when they are younger and have lots of their parent's disposable income. But knowing what will one day be worth a lot of money is anyone's guess.

"Collect what you like, it may be worth a fortune one day," said Ottati.

Headline: YouTube connects students via web videos
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
Founded in February of 2005, YouTube.com is an online database of thousands of original videos made by ordinary people worldwide. "YouTube is a way to get your videos to the people who matter to you," according to YouTube's slogan. 

Well at least that's what it used to be. Today it's more of a free online cable service.

"I stopped watching regular TV," said Junior Ian Quartin. "I can't afford cable, so I watch cable shows on YouTube.  Sometimes they pull stuff, which can be annoying."

For the most part, videos from the site are removed because they break a restriction. Videos are limited to 100MB in file size and 10 minutes in length unless you have been approved for a director account, according to the site. 

There are some days where you will be watching a hit cable show like the "Sopranos" in ten-minute intervals. Then the next they wont be available anymore. 

Unfortunately for those who can't afford cable, there is a thing out there called copyright law.

YouTube is essentially the same as any of the many file-sharing programs like Kazaa or Napster, which were shut down by the music industry for illegally distributing music. 

There are a few key differences between YouTube and file sharing programs, however. 

For starters, unless you are a very talented computer geek you cannot save the video files you watch on YouTube.com. The purpose is to be able to download the streaming video pretty fast	

Let's say you wanted to download a 30-minute episode of Super Squirrels. With a file sharing program like Bit Torrent it could take you anywhere from a half an hour to many weeks to completely download the episode. With YouTube, you can be watching the episode within seconds of clicking on what you wanted to watch, depending on your Internet connection. 

"I love it 'cause you can find almost anything," said freshman Armando Pita. 

When a copyrighted show is uploaded to YouTube it is a matter of luck of whether or not it will be removed. But for the most part older shows seem to be left alone while the more current ones are held under tighter scrutiny. 

TV shows and personal videos aren't the only thing you'll find on YouTube. There are numerous video captures of video games, music videos, documentaries and even a complete promotional video of "Why Scientology is For You." 

For the most part, however, it's the quick 15-second videos are why many log onto YouTube. Right now the "Panda Sneezes" video is getting thousands of hits. After your see the quick video, you'll understand why; it's laugh out loud funny.

Considering the immense popularity of the site, NBC announced on June 27 that it formed a strategic partnership with YouTube. 

Essentially NBC will give YouTube significant promotion on its various stations. 

In return YouTube gave NBC its own channel for it to screen upcoming shows, promos, and even the late night comedy shows like Saturday Night Live - a move which embraces the convergence unlike the music industry in the past.

On the other hand, there are still plenty of individuals who use YouTube as it was originally intended. 

"We post videos of us, like, eating in the car," said freshman Stephanie Alonso. 

Alonso, who has a private area on YouTube, often shares videos with her personal friends. YouTube has also made it easy for people to share YouTube videos on their own websites. You'll often find YouTube videos in the middle of MySpace pages and other personal websites.  

While the reasons for using YouTube vary, its use grown to form an internet mainstay. With a partner like NBC its chances of survival are also much higher than they would be alone.

Part of healthy human development is learning to keep life and its events in perspective, avoiding making mountains out of molehills. As rational beings, we are expected to remain calm and collected when facing a variety of life's ordeals. However, those suffering from anxiety disorders struggle to get over these hurdles.

Anxiety disorders are relevant to college students because, according to GotAnxiety.org, they often occur during a person's teens or twenties, and almost 7% of college students report having symptoms. Counting all age groups, more than 40 million men and women are diagnosed annually, with twice as many women affected as men.

"Anxiety is a normal feeling that we all experience at times in our lives, even for events we consider positive," said professor and counselor Dr. Raysa Richardson.

"Anxiety disorder" is a broad term that in fact covers several different conditions such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is perhaps the most familiar of these conditions, due in part to the popular TV show "Monk," a program that producer David Hoberman -- a board member of the Anxiety Disorders Association of America -- made in order to create awareness of the disorder. A typical day in the life of an OCD patient can literally be consumed by simple tasks, because of the patient's need to constantly perform certain actions.

Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) goes beyond the average feelings of social awkwardness or of not belonging. Those who struggle with it are paralyzed by fear of others opinions. They sense that those around them are constantly watching and judging their every move.

"It's a focus on perfection," Richardson said.

Unlike these other two disorders, General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is less specific; it can affect virtually any aspect of the person's life. According to the Anxiety Disorders Association of America, some physical symptoms of GAD are fatigue, restlessness, muscle tension, irritability, gastrointestinal discomfort and of course, consistent worry. If these symptoms occur most of the time for at least six months, obviously the line has been crossed beyond the average stress level common to us all.

Like many medical conditions, anxiety disorders are caused by a combination of nature and nurture -- genetics, brain chemistry and familial and social environments all play a role.

"One of the issues very central to anxiety is the need to control," Richardson said. "Life is such that we're not always in control and we're not always going to get a 100."

Part of the reason they are often misunderstood is that, as with clinical depression, many people fail to realize that it is a physical disorder and that the patient cannot simply choose to shake it by positive thinking or by "mind over matter" techniques.

Treatment often varies, since no two patients are identical, but the goal of many methods (such as Cognitive-Behavior Therapy) is to have the patients feel that they can exert control over their own thoughts and actions. Recovery might not be immediate, but the ADAA has a wealth of testimonials from those who have overcome their disorders and are now free to live their lives in peace.

"There are different types of anxiety, but the treatment would be to look into thought patterns and helping the person identify internal resources like recalling past experiences," said Richardson.

Students can take some control by getting help if they suspect they fit the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. By visiting www.adaa.org, they can search for a trustworthy therapist, find support groups or read advice on how to help a friend or family member struggling with the disorder. 

Aside from looking for anxiety resources online, the FIU Health and Wellness Center offers a variety of services to students who need help with the disorders. According to Richardson, specialists at the center teach students relaxation exercises and look at their nutrition, exercise regimen and time management to assess students' levels of anxiety and help with treatment.

"Each person has to find their optimal degree of performance," said Richardson. 

Students can stop by Counseling and Psychological Services in the Health and Wellness Center Mondays to Fridays from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., except Thursday when students can come in from 9 a.m. to noon. Anxiety and depression screenings are scheduled for Oct. 3 at Biscayne Bay Campus from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Panther Square and Oct. 4 at University Park in the Graham Gallery from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Headline: Annual writers' reading series begins this week
Author: Jessica Solis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For the past 21 years, the FIU Creative Writing Program has held the Writers on the Bay reading series at the Biscayne Bay Campus, which brings distinguished contemporary writers to the school for a year long series.

Founded in 1985 with the help of a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Writers on the Bay gives creative writing students and faculty the opportunity to meet, listen to and pick the brains of some of the best writers in the country today, according to John Dufresne, creative writing professor.

However, the event isn't just just authors reading to an audience. 

"Every reading is accompanied by a class seminar," said Les Standiford, director of the Creative Writing Program.

 Dufresne had the chance to pick the writers for this year's series.

"Faculty get to rotate and choose writers whose work they admire, writers who are also open to give and take with students," Dufresne said. 

"The variety is something really nice," said Denise Lanier, a Teaching Assistant in the program.

Writers ranging from poets to journalists have all taken part in this reading series that seeks to give people an up-close and personal look into contemporary literature. 

"You don't have to be a creative writing student to attend this event," said Marta Lee, the administrative assistant in the English department. The program has been nationally recognized in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. 

Past guests at the reading series have included Walter Mosely, best known for his crime fiction novels like Devil in a Blue Dress and Dennis Lehane, FIU alumnus and author of Mystic River, a best-seller that became an Academy Award winning film in 2003. 

The series begins Sept. 24 with readings by FIU alumni at Books and Books in Coral Gables and continues throughout the semester. 

On Nov. 2, a reading by best-selling author Lisa Tucker will take place at the Wolfe University Center Theater. Tucker's novels have been published in several different countries and her work has been featured in the Los Angeles Times, CBS Early Show and Seventeen magazine, among others. 

On Nov. 30, poet Ray Gonzalez will read from his most recent work, Consideration of the Guitar: New and Selected Poems. His writings, like the poems "Tiny Clay Doll with No Arms" and "Ears Full of Thorns," paint a picture of the colorful southwestern area where he grew up. 

Graduate student Jen Bartman is eager to finally hear the poet's work in person. 

"I'm looking forward to hearing Ray Gonzalez this year because his reading was cancelled last year due to the hurricane," Bartman said. 

For many creative writing students, listening to the authors read excerpts of their work is a learning experience. 

"This event gives you the opportunity to find out about their process of writing," Lanier said. "The whole idea is to expose students to writers from elsewhere, so not only are they exposed to other writers, but other ideas about writing."

For other students, it gives them a chance to interact with each other outside of the classroom, taking away much of the pressure and competitive atmosphere that comes with it. 

Writing students are also somewhat isolated at times, according to Bartman, so the opportunity to socialize, inform and share mutual interest in creative writing is welcomed.

"It's a good way for creative writing students to form a community," said Bartman. 

The series also gives those students a chance to interact with the faculty and meet with the authors personally. 

"These are social events as well, celebrations of writing not only in the program, but also in the community" Standiford said. 

The event is free to all FIU students and will continue into the spring semester with a new set of writers. 

For more information about the authors scheduled to read, call 305-919-5857 or visit http://w3.fiu.edu/crwriting/.
