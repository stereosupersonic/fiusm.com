Headline: Council reveals goals at 'Cirque du SGA' event

&nbsp;
The Biscayne Bay Campus' Student Government Council announced their goals for the year to students attending Cirque du SGA, an event where students enjoyed games and free food.

The event took place at the flag pole area outside of the Wolfe University Center on Sept. 12.

SGC-BBC made sure to get their objectives across to students not only by making announcements of the event, but also with poster-sized outlines of the council's goals and the Student Government Association's University-wide goals.

Interns and SGC-BBC representatives were available throughout the event to answer student questions and promote SGC-BBC.

FIU Mascot, Roary Rage, took center stage to dance and drew a crowd while the SGC-BBC representatives expressed their goals.

According to Katiana Saintable, SGC-BBC president, some of the council's goals for BBC are ensuring that student services are efficient, establishing relationships with the North Miami community and increasing voter turnout. 

"The Student Government Association is working toward establishing a better relationship with the community so that long term goals like traffic and opening 135th street can be easier to accomplish for future representatives," Saintable said.

Several students participated in a scavenger hunt that required finding out different facts about SGA to win prizes such as free dinners and apparel.

One way the council is making sure student services are efficient is by considering students' input on the cafeteria's menu.

According to Saintable, BBC students were previously surveyed on what foods they would like to see in the upcoming BBC cafeteria. But during the event, students could key in their opinions about the current cafeteria's menu into laptops for a student poll.

Dorothy Torrence, a Miami-Dade County poll worker, was available throughout the event to encourage voting registration, help students with voting card replacements and offer absentee ballots.

One of the council's main goals is addressing the academic needs and concerns of students at BBC, according to Leslie Valentin, SGC-BBC speaker of the house and hospitality management representative.

"We want to communicate more with the students and have more forums to get student issues heard," Valentin said. "Students need to know that we are here to represent them."

SGC-BBC is involved in the Florida Student Association, which lobbies with 10 other state institutions, to local, state and national levels of government presenting student issues such as the current budget cuts to FIU's School of Medicine.

The council is currently setting up a rally where students and members of the council will go to Tallahassee between Oct. 3 and 12 and lobby the issue of the medical school, according to Saintable.

"We are also putting forth effort to let students know about [the medical school] issue and encourage them to be active about it," she said.

SGC-BBC is starting a "going green" initiative. Their goal for environmental awareness is to implement energy-saving and recycling programs.

Miami-Dade County provided David Fonseca, SGC-BBC community relations and environmental affairs director, with water-efficient showerheads for Bay Vista Housing.

"Some have already been installed into individual bathrooms, we are working on having them installed into every bathroom of Bay Vista Housing," Saintable said. 

Despite the early afternoon heat, the event attracted many students such as senior Yvonne Romero.

"I think it's really cool for SGA to provide a free event for students because it's great to attend [the event] in between classes and it almost makes your forget about the heat," Romero said.

Headline: Lecture series to feature alum authors
Author: Jessica Se√±orin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Anyone with a passion for poetry and prose will have a chance to hear several authors read their work during the Writers on the Bay series. 

The annual series, which began in 1985, is free and open to the public.

The participating writers will visit creative writing classes on campus and interact with students. The lectures occur three times per semester, usually September through November, then in January, March and April.

"Writers on the Bay is for the benefit of FIU students and the Biscayne Bay community to hear contemporary writers read their own work. Writers who come to read meet informally with the audience to discuss [their] craft," said Denise Duhamel, English and creative writing professor.

The Fall series will begin by featuring graduates of FIU's Master of Fine Arts program and will later focus on the works of authors, Dean Young and Lee Martin.

The first of the series' three readings will take place at Books and Books, 265 Aragon Ave., in Coral Gables on Sept. 23 at 6 p.m.

The MFA Alumni Reading will also highlight the works of Preston L. Allen, Anthony Gagliano, Christine Kling and Jay Snodgrass, among others. Many of the writers earned their Master of Fine Arts degree from FIU's creative writing program.

Recent graduates of the program, such as Jill Drumm, will also take part in the event.

Drumm, a professor at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers and whose work has appeared in several national literary magazines and journals such as the TriQuarterly Review, hopes to connect with other writers at the event.

"It's all about community. Having moved away from South Florida, I'm mostly looking forward to seeing people I admire and miss working with," Drumm said. "But it's also an honor to join other alumni to share our work and to celebrate the accomplishments of FIU's writing community."

Dan Wakefield, fiction and memoir professor and lecturer, will read from the work of the late Ricky Smith who died last year. Before Smith's graduation, he was honored with a posthumous Master of Fine Arts degree. 

Wakefield was to be Smith's thesis advisor for his master's degree. 

"Ricky Smith was an outspoken, colorful student who made a lasting impression on the program. He completed a masterful memoir, Leaving Home and was hard at work on a second [memoir] when he died. No one who came in contact with him will ever forget him," Wakefield said.

The last two readings will feature Young and Martin. Young, who received numerous fellowships and won the first Colorado Poetry Prize for his book, Strike Anywhere (1995), will read his work on Oct. 25 at 8 p.m.

Martin, director of Ohio State University's Creative Writing Program and whose novel, The Bright Forever, was a finalist for the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, will read on Nov. 29 at 8 p.m.

Both readings will be at the Biscayne Bay Campus; the exact location on campus has not been confirmed.

Duhamel said that getting involved with the reading series leads to success because "[it] is a great way for young writers to learn from published ones."

Some professors say that the series provides a great opportunity for new and old writers. 

"I'm always excited when a writer I really love is coming to read, like when Dorianne Laux read a few years ago, but at the same time, there have been so many writers whose work I wasn't familiar with, but I was turned on to them through Writers on the Bay," said Kathy Curtin, adjunct creative writing professor. "I try to encourage my students who are really interested in writing to see as many readings as possible. I think it's important for them to see how a writer presents his or her work to an audience."

Duhamel also advises students to attend the readings.

"[Students should] come listen to writers read their work aloud. It's very important for student writers to have knowledge of their contemporaries," Duhamel said. "This will be a great line-up, full of lively poetry and fiction."

Headline: Heartbreakers: Statistics prove cheating levels on the rise
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Sometimes two can be better than one - except when it comes to relationships. 

Case in point: cheating. No, not cheating on tests or papers, but cheating on your significant other. Infidelity happens often among the college crowd, but the rates, reasons and modes can all differ.

So how prevalent is cheating? That's hard to tell, according to most sources. 

If someone lies to a significant other about romantic misdoings, why would that person tell the truth for a study? 

But there are some statistics available, and they can be surprising.

In a sample of 404 students, the study No Strings Attached: the Nature of Casual Sex in College Students by Catherine M. Grello, Deborah P. Welsh and Melinda S. Harper, found that 21-percent of students who admitted to participating in casual sex were in a relationship at the time.

Statistics for married couples show only slightly lower incidences of fooling around. According to the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, 15 percent of wives and 20 percent of husbands admit to extramarital affairs. 

Different ethnic groups were surveyed and Blacks have the highest rates of infidelity with 27 percent, while statistics for Whites and Hispanics are 15 percent.

According to Dr. Suzanna Rose, director of Women's Studies, the high rates of infidelity among Blacks is not a cultural defect. 

Rather, the high numbers are probably due to the fact that there are more women than men in the Black community, creating a skewed sex ratio. 

But the fact that married men have higher rates of fooling around is probably no accident.

"The cultural value is the double standard - that's across all cultures. It's more acceptable for men than for women [to cheat]," Rose said.

"I think [people cheat] because Americans are greedy and they want it all, and when it comes to guys, if [women] like more than one, they want them all," said Faaiza Basit, a recent FIU graduate.

The truth is that we cheat for different reasons - sometimes it's intentional, sometimes it's just a mistake, some even describe cheating in evolutionary terms.

If you've ever gotten frisky with someone after having a few beers, you may have experienced accidental cheating. Accidental cheating occurs when it is not characteristic of the person to be unfaithful and they just have a lapse of judgment - mistakes can happen, Rose said.

Then, there is romantic infidelity where the perpetrator is in a deep, committed relationship, but still messes around. Another group of cheaters is the philanderers - the repeat offenders who need to cheat in order to self affirm their power, attractiveness and self-worth.

We might even be able to blame Charles Darwin for our infidelity: evolutionary processes may be able to account for some of our sexual straying. According to Understanding Human Sexuality by Janet Shibley Hyde and John D. DeLamater, a man might cheat in order to produce more offspring to increase the chances of his genes being passed on to the next generation. In evolutionary terms, women may cheat to acquire extra goods for her children or to better her genetic line by mating with more successful males.   

Caught in the act:

Ahmad Irshad, junior, remembers what happened when he ran into his then-girlfriend, who he was having problems with, at a party with another girl on his arm.

"[My exgirlfriend] tripped out and came and threw a drink that completely missed us and went on someone else's face," Irshad said. "Somehow she slipped and tried to hit me and completely misses and hit a girl square on the face and just knocked her out. In the end, there was some girl crying on the floor. She got rocked pretty hard."

Don't let your partner pull a fast one on you, though. 

There is no comprehensive list of warning signs, most sources seem to agree that the following behaviors might point to trouble: sudden increase in time apart, decreased sexual interest, talking secretively on a phone and unexplained payments on bank statements. 

Knowing the signs is not enough to prevent cheating. Rather, according to Rose, partners should have a conversation about trust and to feel secure in yourself and your relationship.

"What it comes down to is not just how secure you are with your partner, but how secure you are with yourself," Rose said.

Headline: Capoeira: Brazilian martial arts-dance hybrid makes its way to FIU
Author: Jose Maya / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
They rock back and forth moving from side to side and in and out of the "roda," or circle, to the beat of instruments such as berimbaus, pandeiros and caxixis, while others surround them clapping and singing.	

They practice moves and maneuvers such as armada, negativa, macaco and au. 

They have been training at the same spot for close to a year.

"Capoeira became an obsession to me since I was kid. It has stuck to me since then," said Sean, better known to felllow Capoeiristas or players as "Descalzo," which translates in Spanish to barefoot, a name he has carried for more than a year.

He is part of a group of students who practices Capoeira Tuesday and Thursday afternoons by the water fountain outside of Primera Casa. 

Capoeira is a traditional Brazilian martial art dance game created by Africans who were brought to Brazil by the Portuguese in the 19th century. 

And although most of the students who practice with "Descalzo" are not Brazilian, they feel a connection to that country.

"It's a spiritual connection with an interaction and a dialogue. Once you start playing it becomes addictive," said Eric Pies, who has being coming to the "games," as they prefer to call the dances, for a couple of weeks. 

Pies also practices the style Capoeira Angola by Deuxieme Maison at night with six other students. Capoeira Angola is a derivation of Capoeira and originally from the state of Bahia in Brazil - it has more trapping and control to it. 

"It contains a different emphasis but it still looks beautiful," Pies said.

And this game is not only limited to men. 

"Girls are good Angolera ... there is a huge feminine side to it," said Riquet Caballero, who along with Sean, is one of the original students who started practicing Capoeira last Fall by the fountain; the two met in a Capoeira class.

Caballero has been practicing for two years and respects the dance as well as those who practice it. 

I still suck," he said when comparing himself to other Capoeiristas who live in Brazil and started playing the game when they were kids.

The group has no hierarchy and sees everyone the same regardless of race, gender or any factor. 

They are currently working to get it enrolled with the Student Organization Council for next year.

But even though they are not an official organization they've caught a lot of attention. 

"They play pretty well. They are challenging with good energy and without getting mad or upset," said Tommy Peeples, who works as assistant trainer in a mixed martial arts facility in South Miami; it was his first time attending the FIU Capoeiristas game.

Diversity reigns within this group as members come from different parts of the world, like Karol Kwiatkowski, who is known as "Monitor Polaco." 

"I started training Capoeira in Poland. Many of us were taken to practice in Warsaw by the leader of our group Nem," he said. 

Capoeira is not only a fight-like dance game to these students - it's a technique that offers a lot more. 

"There is a philosophy to it. The songs tell stories and I do the research to find out more. I'm still learning Portuguese," said "Descalzo."

Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., students can expect to catch these guys and girls swirling and shifting past each other to the beats of different instruments and beats as they gather in the traditional roda.

And although the Capoeira class that was offered last year was not offered this semester due to budget cuts given to all the University's martial arts classes, the group wants others to become involved and welcome all to join or watch.

For more on this interview and Capoeira music, tune in on Tuesday, September 18 to WRGP, Radiate FM, on 95.3 and 88.1 at 11 a.m. on FIU's News Talk.

Headline: Sugar Substitutes: Benefits, consequences uncertain
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When asked what she thought about artificial sweeteners, Sheila San Jose, sophomore, quickly responded, "it causes cancer - that's all I need to know."

According to www.cancer.gov, lab studies have shown that bladder cancer has been found in laboratory animals when cyclamate, a type of salt, is combined with saccharin, an artificial sweetener. 

But no sweeteners including the approved ones out in the market have provided concrete evidence linking cancer in people and the use of artificial sweeteners, products that are part of a multi-million dollar industry and found in an assortment of diet beverages and foods.

According to Professor Konstantinos Kavallieratos from the department of chemistry and biochemistry, all the studies done with relation to artificial sweeteners and losing weight has been done by the same company who sells the product, "so all these diets about artificial sweeteners are based on a fad, it's not really proven in any way," he said.

Kavallieratos mentioned that the Coca-Cola Company makes more money from diet coca-cola than from the non-diet product. 

This is because people who drink the diet beverage have the mentality that they are not consuming any calories. 

Therefore, instead of just drinking one, they drink two or three more as opposed to a person who drinks regular coke and might feel full with just one soda. 

This leads to the following question: what is better to use, regular sugar or artificial sugars?

Regular sugar is a natural nutrient extracted from sugar cane. Unlike sugar substitutes, it doesn't need to go to a laboratory and be made from chemicals; normal sugar gives the body energy and helps it function. 

Sweet n' Low, a commercially popular sugar substitutes was introduced in 1957. 

Sugar, however, can be traced back to 8,000 years ago, meaning that the long-term effects for sugar substitutes have not been studied by researchers as regular sugar has, which has been available for a much longer amount of time. 

Products that contain sugar substitutes are diet coke, light yogurt and juices, soft drinks, breath mints and some over-the-counter drugs. 

Most of these products contains aspartame, which is found in the artificial sweetener Equal, introduced in 1981. 

Aspartame is harmful to people who have phenylketonuria, a rare genetic disorder; people who suffer from this cannot metabolize one of the acids in aspartame and should not consume this product. 

Unlike normal sugar, artificial sweeteners help prevent tooth decay and if you are a diabetic or overweight, it is considered healthier to use. 

The most popular sugar substitutes are Sweet n' low, Equal and Splenda, which was introduced in 2000. Unlike Sweet n' Low and Equal, which are chemically made, Splenda comes from a sugar derivative, but it contains chlorine as one of its compounds. 

Even though it contains chlorine, Wellness Center nutritionist Lori Kupferman stated that it is among the safest sugar substitutes to use. 

Kupferman added that three to five percent of the population is addicted to sugar or carbohydrates. 

Rosalyn Delgado, vice president of the Music Saves Lives club, likes to use Splenda in her morning coffee but doesn't require it to get through the day,

"If I don't have it, I won't go crazy. I wont say, 'Oh, I need Splenda or I can't function,'" she said.  A teaspoon of regular sugar contains 15 calories. A teaspoon of Splenda contains two calories, but it's an empty nutrient. 

Even though Splenda advertises itself as a zero calorie product as shown on its web site, www.splendafoodservice.com, in fact it is not. 

The Food and Drug Association allows a product to advertise as having zero calories if the packet is under five calories. 

With regards to choosing which sugar to use, Kupferman said, "You want to be a good consumer and when something is a chemical and made in the lab, you want to have it in moderation. You don't want to use too much of it."

Headline: Review: Foo Fighters - Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace (Music)
Subheadline: Inconsistency mars new album
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With various studio album releases, the Foo Fighters have consistently remained near the top of the rock charts and maintained strong sales despite living in the shadows of Dave Grohl's legendary former band, Nirvana. This trend will likely continue with the release of Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, due out Sept. 25 on RCA records.

Echoes starts off with an extremely strong five-song run that manages to find a perfect balance between the aggressive, driving sound the Foo Fighters have been known for since the beginning, and the gentler, more melodic sound the band explored on the acoustic half of 2005's In Your Honor; all while still maintaining the band's signature arena-ready choruses and mixing some unexpected influences in.

The album begins with "The Pretender," a song that somehow manages to ape the melody from Sesame Street's "One of These Things Is Not Like The Other" and still sounds ready-made for fist-pumping performances.

Following "The Pretender" are a few more strong tracks: "Let It Die" and "Erase/Replace." Although neither song reinvents the Foo Fighters signature sound, there are elements that do show that if Grohl is not looking to reinvent the wheel, he might at least consider ways to make the wheel seem a bit more interesting. 

While "Let It Die" sounds like a Led Zeppelin acoustic, which isn't new territory for a rock band, the bridge of "Erase/Replace" does represent a new sound for the band with gentle three-part harmonies, a string section and heavily processed guitars replace the buzz saw guitars and screaming vocals that are usually found in Foo Fighters' songs. 

The following song, "Long Road To Ruin," is arguably the strongest on the album. While the previous songs represented a somewhat new approach to the Foo Fighters' formula, The song has a classic Foo Fighters chorus. 

There is a reason the band has been one of the most consistently popular rock groups for almost a decade now, and hooks such as the ones found on this song are a huge reason for the popularity. 

Unfortunately, the album is a bit too top heavy, and the second half ends up lagging behind the first; the front half is loaded with big hooks, while the back half has more acoustic ballads and even an instrumental acoustic base track featuring slap guitar virtuoso Kaki King.

This doesn't mean there are no good songs after track six, as "Statues" the album's tenth track shows. 

This is the first Foo Fighters song to use the piano as the main instrument, with nary a guitar in sight until the solo about two and a half minutes in. 

This is one of the few songs that truly represents a change in sound for the band, as it sounds more like something off of Paul McCartney's Ram than Nevermind.

Overall, despite slowing down a bit toward the end, the album is another solid, if not spectacular, entry into the Foo Fighters catalog, and while they aren't breaking any new ground for rock music, they are finding ways to reinvent a signature sound.

Headline: Review: Good Luck Chuck (Movie)
Subheadline: Cook can't save mediocre comedy
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Ample nudity and stuffed animal love-making mark comedian Dane Cook's latest film, Good Luck Chuck, which starts off strong with plenty of laughs but ultimately ends its lucky streak with numerous clich√©s and an all-too-predictable ending.

Cook plays Charles Logan, a dentist who was hexed when he was ten years old in a hilarious spin-the-bottle incident; the hex makes any woman who sleeps with him find her soul mate, leaving Logan lonely. Unsurprisingly, news of the curse spreads quickly and Logan soon finds that his patient list has increased exponentially.

While attending the wedding of a former flame, Logan literally bumps into Cam (Jessica Alba), an event that sets up the framework for the rest of the film, which consists of Logan trying to win over Alba's character, a borderline-obsessive penguin lover, without losing her to the curse. Predictability ensues but so do laughs, thanks to Cook's mastery of physical comedy and Alba's surprisingly effective performance.

Scheduled for release on Sept. 21 through Lions Gate Films, Good Luck Chuck's flimsy and rehashed premise stays afloat because of Cook's ability to evoke at least a chuckle from the audience. 

Most of the film's funny (and best) moments are driven by Cook's witty banter and animated reactions, some of which were improvised rather than scripted. Alba, whose character is among the clumsiest to appear on the big screen, provides both aesthetic and comedic relief for viewers, with dialogue that plays off and enhances Cook's already clever lines. 

Although the movie delivers slapstick humor, the humor soon grows old and expected. After seeing Alba walk into a pole or lock herself out of her car for the sixteenth time, even her good looks can't hide the screenplay's reliance on placing the characters in the same situation, just in a different setting.

The supporting characters are run-of-the-mill, too. Stu (Dan Fogler), Logan's good friend and neighboring reconstructive surgeon, is a blatant pervert, spewing out breast jokes as if they were oxygen. However, he does have a memorable scene akin to a pastry-loving incident in American Pie. The other major supporting character, Joe (Lonny Ross), Cam's brother, appears high as a kite in nearly all of his scenes, effectively portraying the simple role of a stoner sibling. 

Ultimately, Good Luck Chuck relies too heavily on the actors to push the story and laughs forward. Although such a formula works well in the beginning, the film falters near its end by rehashing its jokes and succumbing to predictability. 

The movie does have its memorable moments, though, but unfortunately those scenes are overshadowed by the repetitive nature of the inherently weak script, making the film only worthwhile for some early laughs and a few chuckles thereafter.

Headline: SGA funds panther pride with tickets
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Golden Panther pride took over FIU Sept. 13.

Students lined up as early as 7:30 a.m. outside the Student Government Association office in the Graham Center to receive one of the limited, free tickets given away for the FIU-University of Miami football game Sept. 15. 

Last year, the Athletic Department offered 10,000 free tickets to FIU students, but it didn't have the funds available to provide the tickets this year. 

Instead, this time, they were available for $47. 

Even though the announcement of the limited free tickets that would be available this year was only made on the night of Sept. 12 through the FIU Web site, word spread quickly.

The line outside SGA at the University Park campus reached the downstairs atrium by 9 a.m. 

The giveaway began at 9:01 a.m. and tickets were sold out by 12:40 p.m.

Public Safety was called for crowd control, but there were no serious issues, according to Jose Toscano, assistant director and advisor to SGA, 

"Every FIU student was very polite and cooperative," Toscano said. "Everyone was very collaborative." 

SGA, Panther Rage, the Resident and Housing Association and Campus Life pulled the money together to pay for the tickets, which cost a total of $7,500. 

Although the University doesn't usually provide free tickets for road games, SGA and Athletics felt it was important to offer students these tickets to help support Panther pride.

"First and foremost [we offered the tickets] to give the students of FIU the opportunity to support the team in 2007-2008. I think that [the tickets costing] $47, it would have affected the number of students able to see the game. 

"Having a couple thousand students there will create school spirit and I think that'll be evident at the game," Toscano said. 

Athletics also provided busing for the FIU-UM, just like it does for all home games.

Headline: FIU student among Miami-Dade officers shot
Author: David Fischer / AP Wire
&nbsp;
A massive 12-hour manhunt for a gunman who killed one police officer and injured three others Sept. 13 ended with the suspect shot dead during a gunbattle 30 miles away.

Among the three officers injured was  FIU student Jody Wright, who is still receiving intensive care at the Jackson Memorial Ryder Trauma Center after receiving a shot on her leg. 

Wright, 31, joined the police force a year and a half ago and was completing a degree in criminal justice at FIU.

In an interview with CBS Channel 4, Dennis Dalley, father of Wright, said his daughter's recuperation looks positive after undegoing several hours of surgery on her injured leg.  

"They've been able to save her leg at this point. We're confident she will be able to walk again, but it's going to be a long haul," Dalley told CBS 4. 

Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez identified the dead officer as Jose Somohano, 37, a married father of two. 

The other two officers were treated and released.

Alvarez said shooting suspect Shawn Sherwin Labeet, 25, was found shortly before midnight Thursday at a Pembroke Pines apartment complex, ending a search that led to traffic snarls, neighborhoods cordoned off and jangled nerves.

Labeet was armed when police closed in on him about 30 miles north of the original shooting scene, said Alvarez, who said the family of the dead officer was informed of Labeet's death.

"They asked us for one thing," Alvarez said. "They asked us to catch the subject. Well, I'm happy to report that shortly before midnight, we found the subject."

The officers had been conducting a burglary surveillance in southern Miami-Dade County when they stopped Labeet on Thursday morning because he was driving erratically, police spokeswoman Linda O'Brien said.

Without warning, he opened fire. It was not immediately clear if the officers returned fire.

Labeet, who may have been wearing a bulletproof vest, fled in his car, which was found abandoned 5 miles away, officials said. An AK-47 assault rifle was found inside, Alvarez said. It wasn't immediately known if it was the weapon used in the shooting.

Labeet's girlfriend was questioned, but she gave officers the name of another man, Alvarez said. 

That caused investigators to waste several hours looking for the other man before he came forward hundreds of miles away in Jacksonville after hearing that he was wanted. He was not involved in the case.

"I'm sure she'll be facing some charges," Alvarez said.

In the hours after the shootings, dozens of officers descended on suburban Miami, searching a wide swath of Miami-Dade and Broward counties. 

They could be seen drawing their guns as they briefly surrounded a house and then moved on. 

They also searched through a garbage truck as others scoured a grassy area on foot. A federal government helicopter buzzed overhead.

Several schools in the area were locked down during the search and warnings were issued.

FIU alerted its community about the suspect search  through an University-wide e-mail that also warned about traffic delays after parts of theTurnpike were briefly closed. 

After the last, fatal exchange of gunfire, at least a dozen residents stood in the heat, waiting to get back into their blocked off homes.

"It is absolutely as a result of an all-out law-enforcement effort to apprehend this individual and some very good investigative work that we were able to locate him and attempt to place him in custody," Miami-Dade Police Director Robert Parker said. "Unfortunately, it led to his death."

Headline: Graduate student works to open doors for gay students
Author: Chris Cabral / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and questioning issues are topics that are very personal to Nadia Williams.

"Back home [in the Bahamas], one of my really close friends struggled with gender issues and, because of where we lived and where we were from, she wasn't able to say anything or talk about it," Williams said. "Her mother died of AIDS. She was a lesbian. And being from the Bahamas and seeing the way people like that were treated ‚Ä¶ it made me want to do something to make a difference."

Because she watched her friend struggle with her sexuality, she decided to accept the LGBTQ graduate assistant position for the Multicultural Programs Services office early Fall 2007.

"Her personality is a good match. She's a good listener, she's very intelligent, and she has a great desire to work in her job capacity," said Jeffrey McNamee, associate director of MPAS.

Nationwide, 3.7 percent of college students identify themselves as LGBTQ while an additional 1.2 percent of students are unsure, according to the 2006 National College Health Assessment. 

According to Williams, the actual number of students who are LGBTQ may be higher since many probably keep their orientation secret. The MPAS office is a place on campus where students can feel accepted and embraced.

She supports making National Coming Out Day a more publicized event on campus, and making it a central part of her campaign to help boost awareness of LGBTQ issues and the "coming out" process as a whole.

"I want to raise visibility of this office. I also want to have more social programs to help LGBTQ students get to know each other. We also plan to work with other [LGBTQ] groups like Stonewall to know what [LGBTQ] students need from us," Williams said.

Though she now fights for and works to help LGBTQ students on campus, having grown up in the Bahamas, she says her home country is not nearly as tolerant.

"We [in the Bahamas] refer to ourselves as a 'Christian nation.'[Homosexuality] is not something people are open about," Williams said. "I think it's unfortunate that people still think that way."

The country has made headlines for the anti-gay bent of some if its citizens. Many Bahamians, in fact, greeted one recent gay cruise ship with protesters Williams said. In 2006, Bahamian censors even banned Brokeback Mountain, citing the film's "extreme homosexuality."

"It's a form of prejudice. And I don't think any form of prejudice should be accepted. I don't believe we should be prejudiced toward anyone for any reason," said Williams.

The MPAS staff looks forward to working with Williams in service of LGBTQ students, according to Robert Coatie, senior director of MPAS.

 "We want students with an interest in LGBTQ issues to use MPAS as a resource," said Allison McCombs, assistant director of the student affairs division of MPAS.

Above all, Williams wants to help all LGBTQ students.

"I have a love for people, regardless of what may seem to divide us, be it class race or sexual orientation. That's what's most important," Williams said.4

Headline: BBC holds African Conference
Author: Wilma Hernandez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
February is the national month for African-American history, but for those who don't want to wait until then may find the 10th annual AfriCANDO "Africa Can Do" Conference enjoyable, presented by the Foundation for Democracy in Africa and the African New World Studies Department at FIU, in collaboration with the Miami-Dade College North Campus. 

"As an Afro-optimistic, I believe all is not lost in Africa, if a number of things are done," said Bertin K. Kouadio, a professor of international relations of Sub-Saharan Africa.

Kouadio will present a paper on cultural pluralism and democracy, in which he will explain how ethno-regional differences have shaped the current civil war in Cote d' Ivore, a country in South Africa.  

AfriCANDO acknowledges the diversity of African cultures and advocates against the assumption that they restrict or prevent African development. Its overall theme this year will be "African Cultures and Development."

According to Akin Ogundiran, director of African New World Studies at the Biscayne Bay Campus, the conference is an opportunity to showcase the importance of Africa as a part of globalization by presenting all the resources available for investments in Africa.

"Some people think Africa's main obstacle for development is culture, but I don't," Ogundiran said. "When I became director a year ago, I felt there was a missing piece to the African puzzle. This conference will contribute to the puzzle by addressing African personality and dignity."

Other themed discussions will revolve around African values and economic growth, science and technology, African women and many other topics.  

"The United States has a great deal of respect and authority in Africa to facilitate investments, however, the United States needs to participate more to make it happen," Kouaidio said, "I strongly believe investing in Africa will be a great opportunity for the [United States]. It will gain a lot from this new partnership with Africa with a minimum of will and trust as this continent has long been seen as a place of chaos, decay and uncertainty."

According to Ogundiran, political stability is an important factor that attracts investors to a country, although Africa is perceived as a violent political space. He encourages students to attend the conference as he feels it will narrow the gap between classroom and real-world experience. 

"Today, business is the engine of growth in any society; therefore, we attempt to empower Africans to be better business partners while attracting young American entrepreneurs to establish new businesses in Africa," Ogundiran said.

Miami-Dade College Social Science Professor Joseph McNair has participated in seven of the 10 years that the conference has been held. He believes the conference is about building links between government, non-governmental organizations and the private business sectors between the United States and Africa.

"South Florida is the gateway to the Caribbean and to Africa, but there aren't any direct flights from Miami to Africa. Hopefully, this partnership will change that," McNair said.

The AfriCANDO conference will take place Sept. 19-22 at the Kovens Conference Center at BBC.

Attendance is not limited to students; anyone interested in Africa is welcomed to attend. For more information, contact the FIU African New World Studies Department at (305) 919-5521.

Headline: QUIT THE CUTS: Any increase must be justified
Author: Eric Feldman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Budget cuts throughout Florida are wreaking havoc on public services, including right here at FIU, which has capped enrollment and postponed opening its in-the-works medical school. As the effects of the cuts become more noticeable, it becomes evident that a tuition increase is necessary to maintain quality at Florida public universities.

Though Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed a 5 percent tuition increase for most state universities, he may still pass the increase. This would mean an additional $160 expense a year for typical undergraduates. 

This is not all that much money if it is required to keep FIU afloat, as long as the hike is really needed to operate the school and isn't yet another undue burden on already cash-strapped students.

But reviewing how the Florida State Legislature is spending its money this year suggests that a tuition hike could be avoided. It's worth asking whether budget cuts are being made in the right places. Both FIU and the University of Central Florida are facing postponement of their medical schools' opening and Florida Atlantic University may have to cut almost $40,000 from its budget. Meanwhile, Crist approved giving the private University of Miami $80 million to fund a genetics institute. UM already charges $33,000 a year in undergraduate tuition and fees, compared to FIU's $3,400. 

According to the Palm Beach Post, State Senator Evelyn Lynn justified giving UM the money because of the "history" UM has with the state - basically because it opened Florida's first medical school. 

First doesn't always mean best, however. FIU's recently-christened law school proves that young institutions can excel if given the opportunity. And it's simply wrong to give private businesses taxpayer money while neglecting public programs. FIU has already hired faculty members for the medical school and FAU has already put $2 million into taking over an oceanographic research facility which it may no longer be able to afford, but both of these may turn out to be a waste of money if the Legislature continues to put UM first.

In this spirit, we should be hesitant to relinquish our money without great scrutiny, lest we end up with increases being passed without question.

In the end, students may have to fork over a little more money every semester. And it will be worth it if more students are able to enroll in our school, if the College of Medicine is given the opportunity to open on time and if it lets our professors  actually afford to print out syllabi copies for their students. 

As we write out our tuition checks for heftier amounts, however, let's just hope that every step was taken to prevent tuition from rising: making the right decisions on which programs to support, re-examining the salaries of the highest paid executives on both the university and state level and eliminating bureaucratic waste.

Proponents of raising the tuition argue that Florida universities are already a bargain, cheaper than universities in other states.  Isn't that a reputation we should work to keep?

Headline: THE SOAPBOX...An Op-Ed Column: Financial aid office's service has improved
Author: Corinne Webb / Special to The Beacon
&nbsp;
I would like to offer the following response to the Sept. 13 article, "Financial Fiasco:  Financial Aid Falls Short."

Yes, as stated in the article, there were students who waited in line, one week prior to the start of classes, to speak to a financial aid counselor about the status of their application.

However, the overwhelming majority of students filed their FAFSA application promptly and received notification of their award well in advance of the start of the semester.  As a matter of fact, the Office of Financial Aid was able to disburse a total of $53.3 million to 16,076 students by Sept. 6, the first day for scholarship and grant disbursements.  

This $53.3 million represents a historic high in the disbursement of aid within the first eight days of the semester.  The following day, on Sept. 7, $12.0 million in refunds were released to more than 9,500 students.  Just two years earlier, Fall 2005, only $11.0 million in aid was disbursed to students within the same timeframe.  As measured by the amount of aid disbursed, it is clear that the Office of Financial Aid has made a significant and successful effort to expedite the disbursement and delivery of aid.   

This historic high was realized, in part, by an aggressive outreach campaign developed by the financial aid staff entitled, "Use your PIN, not your PEN." 

Through posters, e-mail messages, postcards and telephone calls, staff encouraged continuing students to submit their FAFSA application by the March 1 priority deadline.  More than 14,000 students responded representing a 32 percent increase in priority FAFSA filers over last year. As a result, these students were given priority packaging for the 2007-2008 school year.  

To enhance communications with students, the financial aid office also opened up "Live Chat" on their website, www.finaid.fiu.edu, to allow students direct connection with a counselor. This new communication channel provides students with a transcript of the exchange and offers them an opportunity to assess the counselor's performance.  

Approximately 90 percent of the students assessing counselors' performance rated the quality of their service and helpfulness between excellent and good.  This quality performance speaks well of the customer care and attention staff members endeavor to provide students.

The financial aid staff welcomes students' suggestions for improving the delivery of aid and ensuring the process for securing such aid is communicated effectively.  

With this in mind, Francisco Valines, director of Financial Aid, is hosting a special Open Forum Teleconference Sept. 25 at 10 a.m., to enable students to ask questions, share compliments, raise concerns and offer suggestions. 

The session will take place in the Green Library 100B at University Park and in the Wolfe University Center Theater at the Biscayne Bay Campus.   

We value your ideas and suggestions and look forward to seeing you at the Open Forum.

Headline: Ladies Strike First: Golden Panthers pick up first win, in come from behind fashion
Author: Chris Towers
&nbsp;
After falling behind in the early minutes of their game against the Binghamton University Bearcats (0-3-1), it looked as though the Golden Panthers (1-1-1) were going to extend their winless streak to three games.

However the Golden Panthers pulled together with a strong second-half surge that featured two goals and defeated the Bearcats 2-1 in their home opener Sept. 13 at University Park.

Despite controlling the ball for much of the opening minutes of the game and recording the first shot on the Bearcats' goal in the first minute of the game, the Golden Panthers would not strike first.

Binghamton senior midfielder Tricia Reed took control of the ball following a steal, which pushed the ball into FIU territory and took a shot from 30 yards out that arched towards the goal, bouncing off of the left goal post past senior goalkeeper Madeline Gannon. 

"I made a rookie mistake, but my team got me through it," Gannon said.

While the team had several chances in the first half, including three corner kicks in the first 15 minutes, it failed to take advantage of its opportunities.

Following their first two games, the Golden Panthers had 11 days off, which helped with recovery, but also may have led to the slow start in the game. 

"We played too panicky in the first half," said coach Thomas Chestnutt, who recorded his first victory at FIU.

However, the team's conditioning came into play heading into the second half, as the Bearcats seemed winded and used many more substitutions than the Golden Panthers. 

They out-shot the Bearcats in the second half and also pressured them into committing two yellow cards.

Finally, in the 66th minute, the Golden Panthers answered back. 

Off a through pass by junior midfielder Amy Jackson, junior midfielder Maria Gualdron streaked past two Bearcat defenders and beat the goalie one-on-one for her second goal of the season. 

"I think our speed helped us a lot in the second half," Gualdron said. "It helped us keep the pressure on the other team's defense."

The Bearcats nearly retook the lead shortly after as senior forward Danielle White bended a corner kick to senior midfielder Tricia Reed, who headed it towards the goal in the 68th minute. The ball hit the cross bar and the tie remained

 The Golden Panthers had numerous other scoring chances as they held an 8-6 advantage in corner kicks and out-shot the Bearcats 12-10. 

However, they failed to convert any of their corner kicks into goals, generally leaving the ball just out of the reach of teammates in front of the goal.

Nonetheless, the Golden Panthers took the lead in the 76th minute as Gualdron was again in the middle of the action.  She found sophomore midfielder Marina Pappas in the middle of the box, who shot the ball into the bottom, left corner of the goal, putting the Golden Panthers on top for good.

"There's always chaos in the box," Pappas said. "I had my head down and just took one touch and hit it in." 

Pappas recorded her second goal of the season, tying her with Gualdron for team lead. 

Gualdron scored one of the team's two goals in the overtime loss to Florida Gulf Coast and Pappas notched the team's only goal in the 1-1 tie against North Florida Aug. 31.

The Golden Panthers nearly scored again in the 80th minute, as White was given a yellow card following a hard tackle. 

The Golden Panthers could not find the net on the corner kick and would not find the net for the rest of the game.

They would still manage to hold on to the win thanks to the strong defensive play of junior defender Kia Rigsby and senior goalkeeper Jessica Vaccaro, who replaced Gannon at halftime and made one save.

The team gets another long break between games, as it doesn't play again until Sept. 21 against Murray State at University Park at 6 p.m.

Following the game, Chestnutt was simply relieved he got over the hump and picked up his first victory. 

"It feels good," he said. "The ladies worked hard. They deserve it. They definitely deserve it." 

Pappas mirrored her coaches' sentiments, explaining that the team had been performing better than their record indicated and that eventually they would catch up. 

"We've been playing well, even though we've been losing," she said. "We just needed to pick up that first win."

Headline: Fighting based sports gain popularity among athletes
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
People have been fascinated with watching fighters battle for centuries.

Evidence takes us all the way back to the Roman Empire when fights to the death were an occasional draw at the Roman Coliseum.

Due to the popularity of organizations like the Ultimate Fighting Championships and World Wrestling Entertainment (formerly known as the WWF), it is common to flip through television channels and catch a glimpse of a wrestling ring or cage with at least two people pounding and launching each other.

The popular franchises of UFC and WWE have even stretched their influence to FIU athletics.

FIU sophomore offensive tackle Andy Leavine is a cousin of former wrestling star Dan Spivey.

"He was a real big name back when he wrestled and someone to look up to in the family," said Leavine about his cousin.

Professional wrestling (WWE) has been one of the most popular forms of modern fighting over the last few decades. 

WWE consists of a cast of good characters and evil characters wearing costumes and portraying several personas.

Leavine sports shoulder length blond hair reminiscent of the WWE legend Hulk Hogan and says he one day hopes to follow in his cousin's footsteps.

Leavine would like to get started in wrestling by joining an amateur wrestling league in his hometown of Tampa. 

As far as training to become a professional wrestler goes, he wants to wait until he graduate with a degree in Sports Management. 

Spivey wrestled with the likes of Lex Luger, Bret "The Hitman" Hart, and spent some time as a member of a tag team with Mark Calaway, who would later gain fame as the Undertaker.

Growing up, Leavine was a big fan of three-time WWE world champion wrestler Mick Foley, also known as Mankind, Cactus Jack and Dude Love.

The WWE plans the outcome of its matches ahead of time and creates drama to keep fans tuning in week after week to see a type of never ending soap opera.

Recently the WWE had a storyline going for weeks that its owner and CEO Vince McMahon had unknowingly fathered a WWE wrestler. 

When the truth finally did come out and the "bastard son" was revealed, he turned out to be a 4 foot 5 little person wrestler dressed as a leprechaun and known as Hornswoggle. 

However, even with bizarre plot lines running rampant on WWE broadcasts, the wrestling can be pretty intense. 

Contrary to popular belief the occasional bloodshed seen in WWE matches is real.   

Unlike the staged WWE matches, UFC fighters use nearly every body part as a weapon. The UFC was created and started drawing fans in 1993. 

The brutal fights were then seen only on Pay-Per-View, home video and in-person. After the sport rose in popularity, some people began to complain about the violent nature of the UFC.

Soon a video of an UFC event found its way into the possession of Republican Senator John McCain who was outraged at what he saw and deemed it to be the equivalent of "Human Cockfighting." 

McCain started a campaign that led to "no-holds-barred" fighting being banned in 36 states.

After putting several rules in place to limit acts of extreme violence in the UFC such as biting, attacking a downed opponent and groin strikes, the UFC gained some legitimacy and became what it is today. UFC is currently very popular and has drawn millions of fans.

Most members of organizations like the UFC and WWE often have a background in the martial arts and sometimes football. 

Dwayne Johnson or "The Rock" entertained his fans for years by making an example out of "jabronis" and asking his fans if they smelled what he was cooking in the wrestling ring. 

Prior to becoming one of the most popular wrestlers in the business and an actor, he played defensive line for the University of Miami.

Fellow lineman Leavine is not the only fan of fighting sports on the FIU football team. 

Head football coach and former University of Miami offensive lineman Mario Cristobal played with Johnson on the 1991 National Championship team at UM, and is also a fan of the sport. 

He has been training in the martial arts for recreation since he was young and is a fan of the UFC. 

Cristobal even acknowledges that some forms of martial arts can be effective- and even legal- on the football field. 

"Guys who are real good at hand to hand combat have been very effective in teaching offensive and defensive linemen how to gain leverage and how to gain inside hand position on certain players," Cristobal said.

Fighting is a sport that has never lost its popularity, but has taken different forms throughout the years. 

Whether the fighters are wearing spandex, g-strings or grappling in a ring, fighting entertains people much like organized sports does.

Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Josh Banks and Willie Collazo, two former FIU pitchers, made their Major League Baseball debuts in September with the Toronto Blue Jays and New York Mets, respectively. 

The right-handed, Banks debuted against the New York Yankees Sept. 11 in the ninth inning. 

He recorded one scoreless inning of work, retiring Robinson Cano, Melky Cabrera and Johnny Damon in succession.

A second-round draft pick in the 2003 MLB draft, he was a First Team All-Sun Belt Conference pitcher, posting a 2.65 ERA in his senior year. 

"I wasn't surprised by Josh making the big leagues because he was drafted so high," former FIU baseball coach Danny Price said.

Banks recorded a 10-11 record with a 5.17 ERA in 29 starts during the 2006 Triple-A season. 

He struck out 126 batters and walked 28 over 170 2/3 innings. In four Spring Training outings, he posted a 1.50 ERA for the Blue Jays.

The left-handed Collazo's debut came on Sept. 2, against the Cincinnati Reds. He allowed two hits in 2/3 scoreless innings.He also contributed to the 2006 Puerto Rican World Baseball Classic team. 

Collazo was a 10th round draft pick of the Atlanta Braves in 2001. 

He attended FIU from 2000-2001 after transferring from Kirkwood Community College in Iowa.

"These two always wanted the ball," Price said. "They've been loyal to the program, and they've comeback to help out with the program."

Headline: Commentary: Mental and physical stamina  lead to improvement, win
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The second victorious FIU team this Fall finally revealed itself: women's soccer.	

Women's volleyball was the first Fall sport team to record a win this season, now women's soccer has succeeded in becoming the second. 

Sophomore midfielder Marina Papas' kick inside the box late in the second half sealed the Golden Panthers' victory.

However at the outset of the team's first home game, it looked as if the Golden Panthers would waste another manageable contest. 

All it took was five minutes for FIU to trail the Binghamton University Bearcats 1-0. 

Lady luck blessed the Bearcats with a 30-yard bomb that rendered goalkeeper Madeline Gannon defenseless. The fans in attendance received an early punch in the stomach.

The team's resilience, however, began to overcome the Bearcats' early strike throughout the first half. 

They continued to pressure the Bearcats with a stellar defensive effort. The Golden Panthers' defensive unit dictated the pace of the entire game.

Past games show that a slow, low-scoring game favors the Golden Panthers because they are able to wear down the opposing team. 

Despite their size disadvantage, the Golden Panthers' defenders were aggressively attacking the opposing team's offensive playmakers.

On the offensive side of the ball, junior forward Maria Gauldron was causing havoc for Bearcats defenders. Her speed had defenders chasing after her many times. On the other hand, her offensive charge was halted continuously. 

She also began to show signs of fatigue; at one pont, she had to place her hands on her knees and catch her breath.  

The one goal was the only offense either team could muster in the first half.

New coach Thomas Chestnutt's rigorous practices would affect the second half of play. Now that the defensive unit had regained control and the offense was exhausting the Bearcats defense, it was a game of endurance.

The team with the best stamina and conditioning would be the winner of the game. 

The second half resumed with a new goalkeeper, senior Jessica Vaccaro, but with the same energy. 

The first 15 minutes saw no clear advantage. 

Then, one pass shifted the momentum in favor of the home team. 

Junior midfielder Amy Jackson crossed a precise pass at the feet of Gauldron, who was breaking towards the goal with a defender on her back. 

As she controlled the ball, she accelerated towards the incoming goalie like a bull charging a matador's target. The goalie slid at Gauldron's feet, but it was too late. The ball was already on course for Gauldron's third career goal.

The celebration ensued with Gauldon pointing a number one at the crowd as it shook the stands.

Yet, the Bearcats showed their resilience by shooting a header off the crossbar. The near-goal completed the disintegration of the Bearcats' morale. 

Their heads low, coupled with low stamina, spelled the end of the game for the Bearcats.

Gauldron continued her night by passing the ball to Papas for the game-winning score. The 2-1 win is what the team needed to relax. 

The Golden Panthers can now stick to playing their style rather than letting opposing teams decide the pace of the game.

They won a game against a team they should've beat, but that doesn't detract from the comeback they made.

Chestnutt's first win at FIU was a direct result of his three-a-day practices and instruction.  He planned the long break before this break before the season commenced.

The offense will need to take advantage of their ball handling skills to produce more points. 

The team's speed, agility and stamina are the tools they will need to use to be successful this season.
