Headline: Freshman conquers embarrasment and myths during summer

&nbsp;
Walking into the Graham Center was not as easy as I first thought. 

Coming from high school, I expected this building to be smaller, but no, I was unpleasantly surprised. 

It was huge! The only thing running through my mind was, "I'm a freshman again, I now have to deal with  the annoying upperclassmen pestering me about some pool on the roof and the mean professors that hate freshman." My first impression was a lonely one. 

Who in this entire campus was going to help me get around? Am I too going to feel the wrath of sleeping through most of orientation? 

I calmly took a deep breath, and entered GC with nothing less than thousands of butterflies in my stomach leading me down the endless halls.

The first day of my very first semester as a freshman was exactly how I pictured it: completely horrifying. 

Not only did I go into the wrong building, but I sat in the class I was scheduled to go to at 12:30 p.m. and it was only 8 a.m. 

I don't think you understand me when I say, I sat in on almost 15 minutes of a class I wasn't even taking! 

Once I noticed that the teacher was not talking about math, I stood up, very noticeably, and ran out of the classroom to the Charles Perry Building where I was 20 minutes late to my first class. 

By the time I found the class, I was panting. I looked as if the university had let loose a pack of wild ostriches after me from the nature preserve on campus. 

You better believe the entire class took the time to watch me in my glory find a seat in the back of the room. That day was, by far, one of the most mortifying of my education.

The first couple of days were also really hard. None of my friends were enrolled in Summer B, I had just learned to drive my car so I didn't feel comfortable leaving campus, and I had three hours between classes to do absolutely nothing by myself. 

I was really uncomfortable in my own silence. I relaxed in the bookstore every day between my classes and sat in the giant comfy chairs with a Java chip frapuccino in one hand and a US Weekly in the other. 

After the first few days, I noticed that I was not the only regular to come to this very spot in the store. 

I started talking to other freshmen who wandered there for a place to go and I quickly made friends. 

My little hideaway became my entrance to the world of college life. 

Now I am six weeks more experienced with FIU's student culture, and, I must admit, it was not always easy. I learned the hard way that college is not high school, at all. No older students treated me like a freshman, and everyone was willing to help me out if I needed help finding a class or if I just needed to be social. 

For the first time since middle school, I took the time to study for tests and I wrote the best essays I've ever written in my ENC 1102 class. 

I also got to know the library better than any other building on campus. 

So if you're an anxious, ignorant freshman like I was, don't fret. 

You are not alone and there are people everywhere willing to help you. 

All of the students are here to learn, just like you, and we've all had the first time jitters. Luckily, it will soon pass, and when that happens, you'll see the fantastic opportunities that await you. 

Welcome class of 2009. Let's make these next four years the greatest years of our lives.

Headline: FIU takes safety precautions by keeping track of sexual offenders on campus and providing students with information via website
Author: Editorial
&nbsp;
As the university continues to investigate whether campus police officer Frederick Currie sexually assaulted an 18-year-old woman off campus last July, one of several questions comes to mind: Does FIU keep track of how many convicted sexual offenders are employees or students on campus?

The Beacon asked the university to produce a list of registered sexual offenders that are working or enrolled in classes at FIU. In less than 24 hours, Captain Michael Wright responded to the request. 

Not only does FIU keep proper track of how many registered sexual offenders are on campus, but the list is made available to the general public via the FIU campus police website. 

Four men are listed as convicted sexual offenders. However, there is no way of knowing from the website which of the four are students and which are employees. 

The university should be praised for making this information readily available to the university population in a time where even 9-year-olds have been convicted for committing sex crimes in south Florida.

Other universities aren't so open with this information. In fact, the University of Miami site simply links visitors to the state's sexual offender website, which can give you more information on sexual offenders in your area, but not necessarily on campus.

This website should be checked on a regular basis. Apparently, it is legal for convicted sexual offenders to be employees or students at FIU. Students registered as sexual offenders and are applying to the university must go through the Judicial Services department for admission. 

Officials there evaluate the students before admitting them into the university.

It is clear that the university is taking serious precautions in having sexual offenders on campus. Those precautions should give FIU students and employees a greater sense of security on campus in regard to sexual predators.

Headline: Importance of home life reiterated during summer break
Author: Cristela Guerra
&nbsp;
The ability to adapt is a trait that has always been a necessity for any living creature to survive in a new habitat. Most animals have a variety of environments that they feel comfortable and thrive in. They can live in the environment for years, but suddenly they wake up one day to find that the Ice Age has come and they are history.  

I'd like to think human beings are different: Actually, I'd like to think I am different. 

Yet, looking back on these last two school years. I've moved more times out of my own habitat than any Galapagos tortoise or otherwise stable mammal. Every time I left to move to another place, for any length of time, it has felt like I was leaving a part of myself behind, especially this past summer.  

I lived in housing for the first two years of my college experience.  First as a freshman in Honor's Place, second as a resident assistant in Panther Hall - a job that helped me grow immensely in the span of one year.

Living in housing for some might not be looked at as an ultimate way to claim your independency. You have to sign in guests, there are restrictions on what you can and cannot do to your room and more often than not, you are placed with people you barely know.  

But independence, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. The way I like to see it is that it's the first step into that scary place called the real world. In your transition to adulthood,  having a job is a pretty big step. 

In my case, having a position that had responsibilities such as heading up a hallway of 40 freshman, creating activities, being a resource to your residents and overall maintaining the peace in the name of all that's good and right, is pretty close to having a real job.

After living on campus 70 percent of the year, in other words, being "on duty" as an RA (which meant that I was basically on lock down in the residence building various weekends as part of the work) meant I was facing the numerous trials of adulthood, such as being able to afford my own toilet paper and toothpaste. 

Moving back home this summer was tough. At home, my privacy was gone. I couldn't leave whenever I wanted, probably because my parent's room is literally 10 feet away from mine. Nevertheless, a part of me knew that coming home for a bit and detaching from the real world was the best thing to do. 

It's easy to say you lose your freedom and aren't taken seriously by your parents, but it's also very obvious sometimes how much you have yet to learn ... even at the age of 20.

Leaving home took large amounts of work and effort, but I had tasted freedom and independence, and I wanted it back. The thing is that along with this independence comes more responsibility than I ever thought possible.  

Going home went from being a trial and thorn in my side to a final trip into my childhood. Things were not always perfect; in fact, the first few days back home were anything but.  

Yet going home gave me a new found respect for my family and has allowed me to see how great they are and how amazing all they've done for me is. 

Moving out of home and into housing has given me a new view on the importance of family life and has allowed me to really start to understand how strong of an influence my parents had on who I am today.  

It took maturity to realize their good intentions and it took a lot of love to change any behavioral pattern preventing my full adjustment into adulthood.

The only thing constant in this world is change and I look forward to continuing this crazy mess of growing up. Perhaps taking time to reflect on the past may help me grow in the future. 

Sometimes growing down maybe the best way to grow up.

Headline: New murals add to campus appeal
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
I was a little disappointed  when returning to FIU for Summer B classes after spending half the summer traveling around the country. From adventure to adventure, from story to story, I had spent the first months of the season living in a time of surprises - I didn't want to return to the routine of daily schedules and, worst of all, the mediocrity of our campus.

Now, before I'm attacked by administrators who constantly claim we have one of the most beautiful campuses in Florida, I'd like to state that, as a residential student, I have walked up and down every street and corner of University Park, thinking from time to time how  mediocre our campus seems.

For example, as modern as our budding residence halls are, they can't compare to the brick and ivy tradition of the University of Florida or the Moorish designs of the University of Tampa. In fact, there aren't many things we can compare with other established universities in the state.

However, my opinion on this subject began to change recently.

After my globe trotting was replaced by term papers and the dread of final exams, I once again took to walking around UP during times of boredom and was surprised to find certain changes taking place around the Graham Center area.

An interesting mural has been placed on the upper wall near the Atrium and Fresh Food Company entrance - a large depiction of our university's history and accomplishments done with photos, news clips, artwork and any sort of media representing the "roots and future of FIU," as stated by Ruth Hamilton, director of GC.

Once I looked up at that wall, I couldn't bring my gaze to the floor again. Painted over a background of bright reds and yellows, the mural is a stunning display of all that defines FIU.This includes athletics like football and basketball, specialized programs like the Latin American and Caribbean Center, media outlets such as The Beacon and Radiate FM and whatever else the school has tried to dabble in within the last 30 years.

"Students don't have any appreciation, any affinity to our institution," Hamilton said. "It was felt we needed to visually display the many accomplishments of the university to give our community a sense of awe for what we have done."

And awe is exactly what I felt looking up at that work, reading quotes from such famous guest speakers such as Bishop Desmond Tutu and poet Maya Angelou or while looking at the flags of countries surrounding the opposite wall.

Leaving GC, I noticed a resting area being developed near the fountain, complete with a miniature garden, a bench and a series of swinging tables. The place, like the mural, was beautiful. It seemed like the perfect area for students to take shade between classes, smoke, read a book or just talk with friends.

I started to slowly realize the minor improvements taking place on campus and how everything looked just a little better than it did before I had left a few months ago. Soon, a towering building will be given to the little-appreciated Frost Art Museum, bringing culture and beauty to our forgotten corner of Miami. Maybe more rest areas will be set up in the future and who knows what else can be done with underdeveloped areas like the nature preserve or the land around the Pharmed Arena.

We may not have Moorish, Gothic or any sort of traditional architecture for our buildings, the best looking Greek houses or the prettiest ponds, but at least we have time and at least we're trying.

"We've done so much in what little time we've had, as compared to universities that have been around for 300 years," Hamilton said. "Just look around and you'll see that we'll get there soon."

Headline: Maturity, sex, tolerance for alcohol among things learned at FIU dorms
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
I remember the first time I took a commuter friend of mine on a tour of the residence halls during my freshman year - showing her the various lounges, kitchen areas and rooms. Once the tour was finished, I was quite surprised to hear that the only question she had for me was a rather blunt and serious one: "So where does the sex happen?"

After two years of living on campus, this reaction has become a common one, primarily asked by students from FIU's large commuter population. Maybe this is due to the viewing of movies like  "Animal House," "Van Wilder," or "Road Trip" that depict a hormone-driven image of college dorm life ruled by orgies, drug revelries, alcohol binges and a series of irresponsible misadventures. Or maybe it could be because the image, however exaggerated Hollywood has made it, is partly true.

So far I've lived in only two of the four residence areas at University Park, Panther Hall and the UP Apartments. Though PH is now the official freshman-only building, it used to have quite a mix of students, both graduate and undergraduate, especially in the Honors College wing. It was in this particular residence hall (this is the title FIU has given to the dorms) that I encountered my first glimpses of the college life.

The first fact to learn is that there's always something happening in the residence halls. Whereas most of UP slips into a dull period of inactivity once the evening hours have set in, night-time ushers a flurry of noise and events within the buildings that shouldn't be missed, especially on the weekends. 

At these times the doors of rooms are always opened. The sounds of hip hop or salsa blasts through the halls as students dressed in their finest clothes await the late-night party and clubbing hours.

Sometimes, the parties are cautiously brought into the rooms, with students trying their best not to attract the attention of the resident assistants who monitor the hallways. This careful avoidance of the sole authority figures within the buildings has been turned into a game by some, seeing who can break the most rules without getting caught. 

As part of this game, I've seen a group of girls trying to hide a giant snapping turtle in their room (they wanted to keep the wild creature as a pet); guys carrying clinking liquor bottles in garbage bags, which they call trash, though they're suspiciously taking the bags into the room instead of out; students of both sexes bringing in "friends" past midnight through secret side entrances, telling the guest that this will be the exit they will quietly take in the morning; and other instances of silent misrule that have become the stuff of dorm legend.

This kind of subversion does not happen in every building, though. It is known by most resident students that each part of housing carries its own rules and even personality. In my opinion, it is the UP Apartments that have the best characteristics.

Many would refer the UPA as being the most peaceful of the residence halls, a title that could be a little misleading. Besides the fact that the apartments are set near a serene lake and contain some of the most scenic parts on campus, I take 'peaceful' to mean that there's little outside interference, giving students more independence than in the other residence halls, and thus, more opportunities to live life how they choose.

Here, parties are a more common occurrence, resulting in a higher percentage of brawls and police intervention than the other buildings. There are no secret entrances here because the apartments are spread out around a large area. 

However, because most of the students in UPA are usually older and have already experienced a large portion of the college life, the revelries there are mostly contained, the RA cat and mouse game replaced with a quiet understanding: They'll leave you to your business if you leave them to theirs.

The wild scents of on-campus living are those of cigarette smoke, urine-soaked staircases, midnight vomit, the humidity of balloon fights, unwashed sheets and decaying pizza boxes. I will miss it all once my college career is over and I'm forced to move out on my own. At no other time in a student's life will the phrase "seize the day" mean so much as it does now, and, as paradoxical as it may sound, it is through the excesses of those days that students experiencing parental independence for the first time learn moderation. 

There is no life like that of living on-campus, and I recommend it to all students, whether they move here from Alaska or live right across from the eighth street entrance.

Headline: Dolphins legend leaves impact on students
Author: Gabriel Medina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Dan Marino's time for glory is looming ever closer. The number of days until his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame has grown so small that it's possible to count on one hand. 

Whether you cheered for or against Marino during his career, one thing that the former Miami Dolphins quarterback has earned from everyone is respect. Students around FIU are acting that way. 

Freshman Raymond Medina is a die-hard Indianapolis Colts fan and makes it a habit to cheer for any team that the Dolphins have the opportunity to play against. 

Despite Medina's lack of love for the hometown team, he feels that Marino has earned the right to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. 

"He should be remembered for a lot of things," Medina said . "[That includes] his loyalty to the community, his loyalty to the Miami Dolphins and his strive for success."

Marino's career statistics are impressive but some people, even Dolphins fans, admit that they are afraid that Marino's accomplishments will be overlooked by the fact that he has never won a Super Bowl. 

One of those people is incoming freshman and Dolphins fan, Miguel Lorenzo.

"I think that people are going to overlook [Marino's] impressive statistics because of the fact that he doesn't have a Super Bowl ring," Lorenzo said. "It really is a shame."

Medina thinks differently,  though. 

"I don't think [he will be overlooked] just because [his statistics] are proof that he was one of the best. The problem was he never had a great supporting cast."

Because Marino had such an affect on the community and on the lives of South Floridians, each person also has their own Dan Marino memory.

"What I remember most about Dan Marino was when he used the fake spike play to beat the New York Jets," Lorenzo said. 

Dan Marino stunned the New York Jets in 1994 when he faked a spike and tossed a winning 8-yard touchdown to Mark Ingram with 22 seconds remaining.

Marino doesn't deny that he had two coaches during his Dolphins career; however, he has only praised one of them as a genius.

"Coach [Don] Shula put a lot of work into what he was doing over the years. Things changed, but he was an incredible influence on my career," Marino told The Palm Beach Post. "He's a guy I respect very much and I'm real excited he'll be there [at the induction ceremony]."

There has been no mention of an invitation for Jimmy Johnson, Marino's second coach, to the Hall of Fame ceremony though. 

In 1999, his last NFL season, Marino's completion percentage fell to a career-worst 55.3 percent. Johnson emphasized defense and the running game in hopes of taking the team back to the Super Bowl, but failed to take Miami over the top. 

Marino averaged 27 touchdowns and 15 interceptions per season with Shula, compared to 17 touchdowns and 13 interceptions with Johnson.

Although Marino has never attacked Johnson, Shula has wasted no time in criticizing him.

"He had only one head coach, really. Look at the numbers. They speak for themselves," Shula said in an interview with The Palm Beach Post.

Marino is to be inducted alongside quarterbacks Benny Friedman and Steve Young on Aug. 7.

Every football coach, player and fan has an opinion about how Marino should be remembered and of how he will be remembered. 

Although Marino may be seen differently in the future, one thing still holds certain: he will be remembered.

Headline: Hall of Fame induction well deserved for QB
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
March 13, 2000. That's the day the greatest quarterback to ever play the game of football retired.

That's the day the game of football lost someone special - not just for his talent - but also for his character and sportsmanship.

Of course as you all may know, I'm talking about Dan "The Man" Marino.

After a brilliant career en route to setting or tying 27 NFL records - most of which he still holds - Marino will get inducted in to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Aug. 7 in Canton, Ohio.

Marino's career numbers speak for themselves. Most touchdowns (420), most yards (61,361), most completions (4,967), most seasons with 3,000 or more yards passing (13) and most yards gained in a season (5,084). I can go on and on but I don't want to fill up the entire page with stats.

From the day Marino set foot on an NFL field, he tore up the competition. His Rookie of the Year award in 1983 was topped by his Most Valuable Player award the following year. He was the first rookie quarterback to ever start a Pro Bowl game.

Despite an outstanding sheet of career numbers, Marino also made the careers of other players better.

He turned players like Oronde Gadsden, Irving Fryar, Fred Barnett and O.J. McDuffie into well known receivers.

He created superstars out of Mark Clayton and Mark Duper. The most impressive thing about all this is that Marino never had a star running - or even a half a star running back for that matter.

Most people now a days are Dolphin fans because of Marino. When he retired, he left the bar so high that it has been hard for other quarterbacks to win the heart of Miami fans.

With Marino in the game, you knew the Dolphins always had a chance to win.

 In his 17-year career, Marino brought the Dolphins back from a fourth quarter deficit a total of 37 times. [His fierce competitive edge always poise for other teams.]

Off the field, Marino also earned MVP honors. He established the Dan Marino Foundation, which was created to benefit children's charities in South Florida. 

He created the Miami Children's Hospital/Dan Marino Center in Weston that opened in 1998 and offers comprehensive health care to children with chronic medical needs.

Despite his fame and popularity, he never forgot about the community. That's what makes Marino stand out from other pro athletes. 

I had the opportunity to meet Marino earlier this year at the Golden Panther Football Banquet; it gave me the chance to meet a modern day superhero.

Even after a brilliant career, Marino remains humble and honored that he was selected.

''There's no doubt it's a great honor, but there's no one who ever got to the Hall of Fame by themselves,'' Marino said at a news conference earlier this month. "Football is a team game. There are so many people involved in being part of your career and your life. So in some ways, this is a little uncomfortable."

I will never forget the way Marino played football and the way he carried himself. Here in Miami, we take for granted what we had. We should be thankful for having 17 great seasons of Dan Marino. Players like him in football, Michael Jordan in basketball and Lance Armstrong in cycling, don't come around often. 

Even though he never got the Super Bowl ring he always wanted and deserved, he's still done more for the game of football than any other quarterback. 

I'm grateful for the memories. Thank you Dan.

Headline: Pair of Golden Panthers picked for Sun Belt preseason honors
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Offensive lineman Victor Cerinus and cornerback Nick Turnbull were named to the 2005 All Sun Belt Conference Preseason Football Team, thus making them the first Golden Panthers to earn Division I-A honors.

The teams, which are selected by the conference's head coaches and selected media members, were announced at the Sun Belt Conference Media Day on July 25 in New Orleans.

Cerinus and Turnbull will both be fifth-year seniors as the FIU football program enters its second and final year of transition into Division I-A. 

Both players have also been previously mentioned among the best at their respective positions in the Sun Belt Conference and Division I-A, according to several national publications.

Cernius, from Tampa, Fla., has started every game of his three-year collegiate playing career and has been awarded FIU's Iron Man Award for the last two years. 

In the 2004 season, Cerinus allowed only nine quarterback sacks and was a vital part in the Golden Panthers' No. 42 nationally ranked total offense in I-AA, which averaged 382.8 yards per game. The offense was also ranked No. 54 in scoring, averaging 27.9 points per game. 

Turnbull, from Miramar, Fla., split time last season between free safety and cornerback and ranked third on the Golden Panthers with 71 tackles ­- 41 of which were solo tackles. 

In 2004, Turnbull led the team in interceptions for a third-straight year, with five. The defensive back has 14 interceptions for his career.

The football team opens their 2005 season Sept. 3 on the road against the 2003 Big 12 champions, Kansas State.

The team's first home game is scheduled for Oct. 1 against FAMU.

Energy conservation may be cool and all, but shouldn't  safety be a top priority, especially after we get nailed with tuition increases and fees up the wazoo?

Headline: Appropriateness of Teele's suicide photo called into question by public
Author: Editorial
&nbsp;
As journalists, our main goal is to provide our readers with the exact coverage needed on any newsworthy event -  whether that event is a presidential rally, a celebrity appearance or in the most recent case, a suicide. News must be covered, no matter the consequence.

On July 27, ex-commissioner Arthur E. Teele shot himself in the Miami Herald building in Downtown Miami. The following day, on its front page, The Miami Herald published an extensively graphic photo of Teele, lifeless on the ground with blood splattered all around his limp body. Feedback concerning the decision to publish such a graphic photo was mostly negative, but what most seem to forget is the simple fact that he shot himself in Herald premises. If Teele would have committed the action at any other location, Herald photographer Roman Lyskowski couldn't have possibly taken such an impactful picture. It's hard to fathom why anyone would want to kill himself in such a public place, unless, of course, he wanted to make the affair one that would strike the public with a weird concoction of horror and pity. When push comes to shove, Teele wanted to be seen as a tragic hero - one who was crucified and humiliated throughout the media, specifically in The Miami Herald. He was coaxed into committing a suicide due to his demising quality of life, after being indicted on 26 federal charges of fraud and money laundering. Teele wanted to be all over the news; otherwise he wouldn't have walked into a news building. No one should say that any photo taken after his suicide was in anyway crude. 

As sad as it may be, journalists are taught not to let emotions blur their perception and to do what is expected of them - report. Emotions are not an incorporated part of the journalistic process, and they never should be. In order to run a creditworthy newspaper, editors and writers know to have all facts, details and pictures needed to demonstrate the impact of a certain incident, whether the incident is of greater or minimal importance.

Maybe running the picture on the front page was a bit harsh and a more cautious choice would have been to run the picture somewhere on the inside of the paper, but what's done is done. The Herald should not have to apologize for their journalistic actions.

Headline: Temperature rises, students break a sweat
Author: Damian Grass / Asst. News Editor
&nbsp;
Over 100-degree temperatures are heating up cities across the country and FIU students are finding ways to keep cool during those hot summer days. 

In the past few weeks, while Las Vegas hit a record high of 117 degrees and Virginia 100 degrees, Miami was not far behind with sweltering temperatures in the low to mid 90s. 

"It's just horrible. When I come to school, I park my car in the building garage so that I can avoid the heat," said senior Teri Garcia.

For Chris Ceron and his buddies, who play basketball on an outdoor court on the University Park campus, a nearby water fountain keeps them hydrated between games. 

"It's both the heat and the humidity that makes playing ball real difficult," said Ceron, using his t-shirt to wipe sweat off his face.  

More than 50 people are reported dead so far from the nation-wide heat wave in the past few weeks. University officials have warned employees and students of the danger of this extreme heat. 

"Our main tips would be to exercise smart, recognize your limits and don't work out on an empty stomach," cautioned Rob Frye, director of Recreation Services. 

Dr. Tania Kahl, an FIU alumna and medical director for a health clinic in Coral Gables, warns that in this harsh weather, body temperatures rise just by being outside. 

"The higher your temperatures go, the body process breaks down and your body is unable to function," said Kahl. 

Exercising and working outdoors in this kind of weather only makes matters worse. 

If your temperature rises above 100.4 degrees, you could suffer from heat exhaustion, nausea, headaches or confusion. You are also at risk of heat stroke, seizures, heart failure or loss of consciousness. 

Students heading into the Student Fitness Center to workout can't avoid the printed reminders on display to stay hydrated and healthy during the scorching heat. 

A pamphlet, called "Fit Facts", from the American Council  on Exercise, argues that water is one of the most essential components of the human body, yet many people do not understand the importance of a well-hydrated body. 

"I used to hate drinking water," said senior Maggie Rodriguez. "But now, it's like my body craves it. That's why I go everywhere with my water, especially with this heat." 

As the search increases for the comfort of indoor air-conditioning or the safe shade of a tree, one would think that the campus pool would be the first choice for a place to cool off. Not so. 

"We haven't observed any unusual increase in pool use lately as this is the time of year when fewer students are on campus anyway," Frye said. "Plus, we've hosted a number of children's camps this summer so they have been our greatest users." 

Still midway into the summer season, with more record temperatures, attacking mosquitoes, humidity-increasing thunderstorm and even dust storms  covering Miami, it only leaves parents and students wondering if this hell on earth will ever come to an end. 

Eduardo Gonzalez, whose ten year-old daughter Veronica is attending FIU's volleyball and summer camp, is relieved  that most of his daughter's activities take place either in the Pharmed Arena or at the pool. 

"We are an active family. We like to be outdoors, but with the hot weather we've been having, I'm glad Veronica's summer activities weren't limited," Gonzalez said.

Headline: Miami reacts to Arthur Teele suicide
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
 Reactions to the events following the suicide of former Miami Commissioner Arthur E. Teele Jr., who shot himself in the lobby of The Miami Herald building on July 27, have been mixed since the news first made waves throughout the city. 

Many have protested the front-page photo in the July 28 issue of The Miami Herald which shows Teele's body lying in a pool of blood and surrounded by police officers. 

"I was dismayed and disappointed by the Herald's portrayal in the paper," said Bishop Victor T. Curry, a popular African-American pastor, on his radio show on WMBM-AM (1490), as reported by the Herald. 

In a quote by Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez, found in the photo's accompanying article, Teele is described as "egotistical" and "abrasive," a comment which has also drawn protests from members of Miami's black community. 

"I did vote for Carlos Alvarez and thought he'd be more mayoral regarding this tragedy,'' Curry said. 

Teele had recently been indicted with 26 charges of fraud and money laundering. A trial was set for September. 

Despite his tragic end, not everyone is willing to declare Teele a victim of his situation. 

"This has nothing to do with race and none of the charges he was facing had anything to do with being African-American," said Irby McKnight, a political activist from Overtown, in a report by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. "There are temptations in life and every place you go . . . but you have to be stronger."

Headline: Death inspires student's new book
Author: Alejandra Serna / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Caroline A.O. Thompson sat down to write the novel, "A Daughter's Love," she knew she wanted to share a story filled with turmoil and sorrow that would transform into a message of hope and love. 

Thompson's inspiration for her book derived from the unfortunate circumstances leading to her father's death and serves as a spiritual guide on how to deal with life and death. 

"[The book] has all the ingredients for a happy and successful life," Thompson said.

Thompson's faith in Christianity is expressed throughout her book. 

Stemming from her religious values, the book also places a lot of emphasis on the importance of family. 

"My book captures what life is about. It deals primarily with family relations," Thompson said.  

In addition to her father's situation, a lot of Thompson's writing focuses on family troubles she faced during the 1970s. 

This is when she first came to the United States and entered into an arranged marriage that proved tumultuous.

"God gave me the grace [and] a lot of people came to my aid," Thompson said. 

Thompson traveled from her homeland of Uyo County in the Republic of Nigeria to the United States, where she considers herself fortunate enough to study at the FIU Biscayne Bay Campus and is in the process of obtaining her master's degree from the guidance counseling program.

She was able to overcome her early ordeals and transitions to what she calls, "[the] milestone in my life," her college years.

Thompson received an associate degree from York Technical College and graduated cum laude from Spellman College of Atlanta. 

While in school, Thompson received several honorable awards and scholarships.

She also dabbled in the field of writing by working in numerous newspapers and newsletters.

With degrees in social work, she hoped to achieve her self-appointed goal of serving mankind and "uplifting people [by] giving them the guidance that some of them never got from home."

She began her social work after graduation, when she decided to return to her native Nigeria, where she served in the National Youth Service Corps, the equivalent to US Peace Corps.

Despite all the recognition, her proudest accomplishments are those that lie closest to her heart.  

The first of these is her family, particularly her two daughters.

It was Thompson's oldest daughter who encouraged her to begin writing in 1998. Thompson attributes her new book in large part to her daughters. 

They drove her work to completion by reassuring her of her talent and by reminding her of her love for writing, according to Thompson.

She admits to having an innate curiosity about books as a youth and says she would always find books to be inspirational. Not surprisingly, her favorite book is the Bible.

The Bible inspired her to become a Christian writer. However, it was her daughter's support that led her to this, her first project.

Thompson is now looking forward to distributing her book throughout Miami-Dade County schools and libraries. Her church, the Christ Apostolic Church, is also organizing a book launch.  

Thompson is scheduled to hold a book signing at the FIU bookstore this month. 

The event will be supported by the university's Office of the Vice Provost at BBC.

In the future, she hopes to have the opportunity of writing a textbook for use in guidance counseling courses so that she may continue to help others and combat domestic abuse, which she also faced in her marriage.

Headline: Mixed reactions to Nursing School move
Author: Atheena Johnson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Nursing students and faculty are expressing feelings of stress and inconvenience as a response to the School of Nursing relocation from the Biscayne Bay Campus to University Park.

"You go to one campus thinking that you're going to take all your classes there, but then you have to transfer to another campus," said Laura Dodd, a sophomore who has applied to the school.

 The School of Nursing is attempting to relieve this cry by providing a video-conferencing program at BBC.

"We have a special classroom downstairs. The faculty members can teach a group of students downstairs and at the same time, on the [BBC] campus, we have another classroom that receives the video," said Dr. Sue Phillips, director for administration and assistant professor.

The School of Nursing had been looking for the funding to accommodate students who are closer to BBC since the move took place. 

The North Dade Medical Foundation presented the School of Nursing with a $1.25 million endowment to assist with training of nurses on June 29.

Divina Grossman, dean of the School of Nursing, is well aware of the growing need for skilled nurses and is looking forward to watching the program grow.

"There were more than 200 qualified applicants over the past year alone, and hopefully the new funding will increase the amount of students admitted into the program each semester," Grossman said.

One million dollars will be allocated for students via scholarships and the remaining $250,000 will be invested into state-of-the-art facilities, according to a brief delivered by Chester H. Morris M.D., chairman of the North Dade Medical Foundation. 

"We want the labs to simulate actual nursing facilities so that when our students are presented with them, they know how to use them," Grossman said.

Representatives from FIU are searching for qualified students to participate in the nursing program.  

"The program begins recruiting as early as the 11th grade for the nursing program, and not only for students in the Miami-Dade area, but they focus on qualified students in Broward County also," said Paula Delpech, director of admissions and student services. 

With talk of a possible medical school at the university, there are questions regarding how the School of Nursing and the medical program would work together. 

"Nursing and medical directly interact. Studies show that if they don't work well, the patient lacks," Grossman said.

Grossman hopes that both the nursing and medical programs will work closely together, but makes clear that the endowment will solely go toward the students within the School of Nursing. 

Phillips insists that she is unsure in which direction the nursing program will go. 

But thanks to the endowment from NDMF, the School of Nursing will be able to present 20 full scholarships to its students. 

"We're not quite sure if it's affected enrollment. There were groups of students that were not real thrilled with [the move], and the faculty was concerned with traffic and parking," Phillips said. Students agree.

"It was convenient to move. But I think [the scholarships] are awesome. [Scholarships] will help us so we don't have to work part time so much," Dodd said.

Subheadline: One-on-one with Maria Celeste Arrarás
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
Anyone walking by the opened wooden door of the NBC6/Telemundo studio in Hialeah can catch a glimpse of the fiery red-head sitting behind her desk typing away at her keyboard, like a composer on a piano. 

María Celeste Arrarás, the Emmy-award winning journalist and anchor of Al Rojo Vivo con María Celeste, the eye-catching hour-long newscast that airs on Telemundo weekdays at 5 p.m., recently sat down with The Beacon to offer insight into life - a world filled with kids, interviews and a new book. 

Q: You wake up in the morning: What is the first thing you do to prepare for the show?

When I wake up in the morning I read about four or fives papers. I read the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, New York Post and Miami Herald. I have them all delivered to my house.

Q: What do you do to relax after a stressful day at work?

At the end of the day, I do something very silly. I tape one novela (a spanish soap opera), and I watch it because it helps me disconnect and at the same time it helps me keep in touch with what's going on in the business because I see all of the promos.

Q: What was the most impressive city you've traveled to?

When I went to Moscow, but it was still part of the Soviet Union because it was such a foreign system to what I was accustomed to and at the same time there were such beautiful people and people were so repressed, yet they were so nice when you got to know them.

Q: What kind of stories affect you the most? 

Usually the ones that have to do with common people because everybody thinks that when you interview someone famous it's really great, but many of them are really boring or introverted. They have an agenda, and they don't say what they think. And common people, they usually do say what they think.

Q: During your years as a journalist, in what ways has the industry changed?

I think that unfortunately, it's going more video-oriented because when you just concentrate on video, you lose content. It's more superficial in a sense, more for shock-purpose.

Q: Are you currently working on a new book?

I wrote a children's book with Scholastics [Publishing Company] that is going to be published in the autumn of 2006. 

Q: Can you reveal the title of your new book?

Not yet. The editor won't let me because it may change.

Q: What differences did you encounter between writing this book and "Selena's Secret"?

Oh, great! This is much less controversial, and you don't have to deal with all the red tape and all the lawyers and all of that.

Q: Students have to juggle a full load of courses, a job and a social life. How do you balance being an award-winning journalist and a mother to three young children?

Being very organized, writing down everything that I have to do. Right now having a Blackberry (an electronic organizer); that is like my Bible. 

Q: What are your fondest memories of college life? 

I was always into sports. I was a swimmer, was in the volleyball team and  did fencing. I did everything.

Q: Some college journalists admire Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer and yourself. Who did you look up to growing up?

I liked different interviewing skills on different people. I liked different ones for different reasons. I liked an Italian journalist named Oriana Fallaci, who is very controversial but writes very well. She tells it like it is. 

Q: Looking back now, what advice would you give to students who dream of getting a job that may be difficult to obtain?

To get your foot in the industry, even if it is cleaning the floors because it is through being inside that you have access to the people that can later get you the job. Once you're inside, you have an advantage over anybody on the outside. I've noticed that there's a lot of hiring from within, especially interns already in the industry. People are so busy that they don't have time to look for new people, so if they have a good intern they'll hire them and give them the chance.

Headline: Gigolo Rob Schneider gives advice, talks sex
Author: Giovani Benitez / In-Depth Editor
&nbsp;
Rob Schneider is back in the box office, and he's bringing Deuce Bigalow with him in the Aug. 12 release of "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo," a sequel to his 1999 film, "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo."

This time, Bigalow goes off to Europe to train at a gigolo training camp in England. What he discovers is shocking: A secret society of male gigolos. Apparently, someone is plotting to kill off some of the best male gigolos in Europe. 

During a telephone interview, The Beacon asked Schneider about his new film and the origin of his comedy. Needless to say, Schneider didn't take long to reveal little-known facts about a profession many label as taboo: a male gigolo.

Q: After seeing the trailer, your reactions in the film seem to be very natural. What do you attribute it to? Where do you think that comedic nature comes from?

I spent a lot of time as a kid watching Richard Pryor and Monty Python. I also loved Gene Wilder and the Mel Brooks movies. Those are the kind of movies that show that you can really get out there but still keep it real. Because there is no such thing as being too big, as long as you're playing it for real. Whenever you see a young couple, and they're fighting, you hear screaming, you never hear "those guys are way too big." They're going for something.

Q: Where do you come up with these ideas?

I sit around with some friends of mine. To do "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo," I sat around with my friends that write for "The Simpsons," and there were about 15 of us in the room and we just came up with stuff we'd like to see. 

Q: What were your goals for making this movie?

The rumor of me just having an excuse of going to Amsterdam for six months and hanging out in the coffee shops, smoking hash with Venezuelan hookers is extremely exaggerated. People kept talking to me about how much they liked the first Deuce Bigalow and were asking me for years to do the sequel. I thought it would be fun to show some other gigolos, like the crazy European gigolos, and what they do. 

Q: Would you say, in real-life, there are more Europeans gigolos than there are Americans?

I think so. I think the Europeans are willing to do crazier stuff for money. They'll do the Turkish snow cone. You won't get a guy in America to do the Turkish snow cone, whatever that is. These new sex acts, you don't know what they are exactly, but they sound pretty disgusting.

Q: What's the main difference between this film and the first?

It's a little harder than the first one. I've got to tell you, the audiences we've been showing it to were a bit shocked. You've got [a character named] Penis Nose and these gigolos who talk about having herpes. You have to take it to another level.

Q: Gigolo is a ladies man. Austin Powers is another ladies man. Who do you think would get the most play?

I think, if you compare [Bigalow] to Mike Myers with his shirt off, you know I'll get more play than him. But he has more gadgets than me.

Q: For someone that wants to get into the gigolo business, what would you suggest?

Start off with a good waxing. It's very important for a gigolo to be smooth. Also, go to the gym at least once a month. And learn to listen to a woman. It's not only about sex with a woman; they want someone to be there for them and to listen to them. 

Q: What about breaking into the comedy business?

It's almost impossible to do unless you write your own stuff. I would suggest seeing a movie that you like and taking the structure. What I would try to do is to take a dramatic film and turn it into a comedy with its structure.

Subheadline: Some Favorite Things
Author: Tara Wong / Sports Page Designer
&nbsp;
1. CHEERLEADING
What can I say? Cheerleading is my life. It's a part of who I am. It probably sounds crazy, but I'll never stop cheering - at least not any time soon.

2. PANDAS
Ever since I had to do a project on pandas in the second grade, they've become my favorite animals in the whole world.

3. "ANGEL"
If you ever need to find me during the week between the hours of 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 6 p.m., I'll be in front of my television. Sad, I know - but you have to admit, David Boreanaz is pretty hot.

4. GOLDFISH CRACKERS
    Whoever invented these bite-sized crackers should be given an award because they are the best snack in the whole world. When I can't find anything else to eat, which is most of the time, I grab a box of Goldfish and start munching away. The next thing you know, the box is empty. I just can't keep my hands off of them. "I love these fishies 'cause they're so delicious."

5. THE BEACH
 I love to go to the beach when I want to get away and relax. It's close to home, cheap and I can get a really nice tan.

Headline: Story of struggling rapper surprisingly sincere
Author: Andrew Kameka / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Dreams are to be cherished in "Hustle and Flow," but aren't supposed to be sparked by drugs, but DJay (Terrence Dashon Howard)  doesn't know that. He spends his days chain-smoking and slinging cheap weed and prostitutes throughout the sweaty streets of Memphis. His life shows no signs of improving until he crosses paths with a drug addict outside a seedy strip club. 

The junkie exchanges a Casio keyboard for a chance to get his next fix. In that moment, DJay  is motivated to enter the music industry with nothing more than talent and hope. He is an  ambitious pimp and seems to be a new-age anti-hero. 

In flea-market gear and a dingy Chevy Caprice, DJay is a complex of sleaze and confidence ready for rap stardom. He's convinced it will happen when he stumbles into an old friend named Key (Anthony Anderson). Now a recording engineer, Key agrees to help DJay make music alongside the out-of-place Shelby (DJ Qualls). 

In a room with boarded windows and walls covered with egg crates, the members of the trio create music that might improve their directionless lives. 

"Hustle & Flow" goes beyond simply relaying dreams. Writer/director Craig Brewer shows the Southern life of vicious sun, poverty and classic American cars better than anyone ever has. 

He establishes the fact that  in life, things can go well, but there is no guarantee that things will stay that way. Every time the film drifts into a possibly happy place, Brewer breaks the spell with acts of violence - much like the random, and sometimes painful, events everyone goes through in life.

Along with the rollercoaster of emotions strewn throughout the film, he also blends that harsh reality with clever humor. 

When DJay goes to Key's house to discuss music, two of his prostitutes tag along. Key's courteous wife Yevette (Elise Neal) entertains the ladies while the men talk in the kitchen. Yevette, who probably has a Jesus Fish on her car, nervously speaks to two women who commit acts in cars Jesus would never approve. Yevette's look of shock as the prostitutes discuss the sex trade is comically priceless.

A few minor problems exist in "Hustle & Flow," namely the rapid growth in DJay's skills. He unrealistically goes from struggling with writer's block to having the lyrical talent and flow emcees earn with years of practice. Such drastic changes don't happen overnight. 

Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, who plays Skinny Black, also scars the film with his overbearing acting ability. Portraying a famous rapper should be an easy sell for a real-life rap superstar, but Bridges' performance is forced and unnatural. The climactic scene he shares with the show-stealing Terrence Howard makes his faults even more obvious.

"Hustle & Flow" has its shortcomings, but it's an entertaining dramatic comedy. 

Though it rehashes Hollywood standards of sex, violence and an underdog trying to beat the odds, it delivers what films often lack - sincerity. This is a genuine slice of American culture that moviegoers rarely see. It may champion the value of dreams, but "Hustle & Flow" is a compelling reflection of reality.

Headline: "The Island" draws comparison to Orwell novel
Author: Nicole Acosta / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
While many directors are content to simply adapt novels, Michael Bay, the director of "The Island," added his own twist to this sci-fi thriller.

Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is a man who questions his sterilized environment. He eventually discovers that he and his fellow peers are not the survivors of an Earth-shattering catastrophe, but merely clones. He plans to escape the compound soon afterward.

If the viewer has ever read George Orwell's "1984," then he would immediately realize that Lincoln Six Echo has many striking similarities to the character of Winston Smith, who also yearns for more than just feeling total devotion to Big Brother. 

Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) is the Julia to Lincoln's Winston. The two explore new and wonderful possibilities together and they both search for an escape.

Sean Bean plays Merrick, the Big Brother in "The Island," presiding over all and punishing those who get in the way of his grand scheme. Both characters are ever vigilant and pretend to be caring father figures, when in reality they are far from that.

The obvious sampling from "1984" would have been forgivable if "The Island" hadn't been dragged on longer than it should have. 

Lincoln and Jordan had their own personal triumph over Big Brother by escaping - going back to save everyone else made these characters too righteous for anyone's liking. You want to see these two live happily ever after, not become saviors. 

On a minor note, the sterilized environment the clones were living in seemed too ridiculous to believe. Why was everyone wearing white track suits and Pumas? It looks like an advertisement for a Foot Locker commercial? And if the clones are supposed to live under serene conditions, why did Merrick allow them to have a happy hour of sorts?

You have to give "The Island" credit for trying to re-make a classic movie and novel, but next time, Mr. Bay, leave out the martyrdom and cheesy outfits.

&nbsp;
Many people believe there is a moral decline in America and are quick to blame the media.  People feel they have lost control and grasp desperately at almost any promise to reestablish it.  Unfortunately, it's the tolerance of non-violent misconduct in real life, not the media causing most of the moral decline in America's youth.

The tolerance of misconduct in America through the negotiation game is unwittingly teaching our children to break and bend the rules.  Our children are learning that they do not have to be accountable, that a deal can always be made.

This is why it is in FIU's best interest to keep investigating President Maidique and Professor Ebadian's alleged mismanagement, fraud, breach of contract and disregard for departmental rules and regulations. The State of Florida should hold all people accountable for misleading not only the government but the state employees as well.
