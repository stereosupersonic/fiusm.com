Headline: Men's soccer to join Conference USA
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team will have a new home in 2005-Conference USA.

The conferences' Board of Directors voted unanimously to invite FIU into the nine-member conference. 

The soccer team currently plays in the Atlantic Soccer Conference. Conference USA will be the third league affiliation for FIU, which first started playing in the Trans America Athletic Conference. 

All other FIU sports, including women's soccer, play in the Sun Belt Conference, but that's not the case for the men, because the SBC doesn't sponsor men's soccer.

Moving into Conference USA will give Coach Karl Kremser's team a more competitive schedule. They reached the NCAA tournament last season.

"We're thrilled that Conference USA would deem us worthy to be invited in, " said  Kremser. 

"If you look at the programs in that conference and those that are being invited in, it's a great honor and we're looking forward to it."

The men's soccer team was almost eliminated two years ago due to budget cuts but the university managed to keep the team.  

Athletic Director, Rick Mello, is excited  to play in a bigger soccer conference.

"We're very excited and pleased to be joining Conference USA in men's soccer," he said. "Conference USA is one of the most competitive men's soccer conferences in the country and provides competition that is regional in nature with other public research universities."

Conference USA will provide a hefty schedule for the team. Current members Memphis and University of Alabama at Birmingham are nationally ranked, and incoming member Southern Methodist University is currently third in the country.

"The intensity and caliber of our schedule is going to be greatly improved. It should be the top one or two conferences in the country. We are going to have to increase our intensity and our recruiting efforts," Kremser said.

Headline: Red Sox kiss eighty-six year old curse goodbye
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"This is our year." That term has been made famous by Red Sox fans at the start of every spring for the past 86 years. Finally, after generations of heartache, it was their year. And it could not have come in a better way.

This Red Sox season began with the highest expectations ever. Attribute those expectations to last season's American League Championship loss to the Yankees via an extra-inning homerun by Aaron Boone. Those expectations can also be attributed to the disaster off-season where the Red Sox whiffed on a deal for MVP Alex Rodriguez to have the Yankees pick him up.

The war with the Yankees was on. Boston picked up Yankee-killer Curt Schilling and proven closer Keith Foulke. The Red Sox felt they strengthened a team that almost beat the Yankees the previous season.

The season began with the Red Sox off to a hot start, beating the Yankees in seven out of the first nine games they played. As the season continued, however, the front office realized that their defense was not strong enough to go all the way. 

So the Red Sox did the unthinkable, they traded the most popular Red Sock since Ted Williams, Nomar Garciaparra. The Red Sox Nation criticized this move, but wunderkind 30-year-old General Manager Theo Epstein believed that their new additions would make the defense strong enough to win.

As the season went on, the Yankees eventually took the lead in the division, and Boston had to settle for the wild card spot to make the playoffs. In their first playoff series, the Red Sox showed they were a force to be reckoned with by sweeping the Anaheim Angels, the 2002 World Series Champions. They were ready for whatever came their way, especially the Yankees.

In the American League Championships, however, the Red Sox sputtered. Losing the first three games to the Yankees, Boston was on the brink of elimination. Things did not get any better as the team found it its best pitcher, Curt Schilling, with a dislocated tendon in his ankle. 

In game four, the Red Sox stood three outs away from being eliminated facing the best post-season closer in the history of baseball, Mariano Rivera. The team rallied back to tie the game sending it to extra innings. Then, they put the game away with a walk-off homerun by David "Papi" Ortiz. Red Sox had some dignity left, seeing as how they weren't going to be swept.

Then in game five, the Red Sox had some hope. After all, they had Pedro Martinez on the mound. They ended up being in a similar situation as the game before, facing elimination with Rivera on the mound again. 

But lo and behold, the Red Sox prevailed again with an extra-inning base hit by, none other than, Papi himself.

The Red Sox became the first team in the history of baseball to be down 3-0 in a series and force a game six. 

They had the injured Curt Schilling on the mound. Before the game he had his ankle sutured up and pumped up with painkillers causing blood to seep through his sock, visible for everyone to see.

We all know what happened next, they take game six and seven at New York and become the first team in the history of baseball to come back from a 3-0 deficit. 

They reach the World Series by beating the Yankees in the biggest choke in baseball history. New England would not have had it any other way.

Boston reached World Series and swept the St. Louis Cardinals, the team with the best record in baseball. The World Series was just an after-thought, though. The real story was all the years of misery down the toilet. Babe, Buckner, Bucky, and Boone will no longer be uttered in New England again.

Now, the Red Sox stand alone atop the baseball world as the 2004 World Series champions. 

Their celebration parade will have approximately five million people in attendance and it couldn't have come at a better time for the tormented region of New England. 

Sure their Patriots have won two out of the last three Super Bowls and are currently on a record 21-game winning streak, but the heart and soul of this region is exemplified by the Red Sox.

How long have Sox fans been waiting for this? The last time they won the World Series, women weren't even allowed to vote. They've seen 16 presidents take office, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, man land on the moon, the creation of the television, World War II, Vietnam, and most importantly, the Yankees winning 26 World Series titles. 

This victory was not only for the players but more so for the fans. Fans who were born Red Sox fans and died without seeing their team win. These are true diehard fans that have the best attendance in the Majors, selling out every game for the past few years. 

You can tell New England that they don't deserve it. But, they'll simply reply, "Why not us?" because whether you like it or not, "This is our year."

Headline: Red moon rising
Author: Cristian Marino / News Editor
&nbsp;
Standing by the Observation Pad behind the University Park's Chemistry and Physics building, a continuous line of students looked up at the sky, gazing through telescopes or waiting to do so. 

Over them, the clouds hid the moon, which over the course of the night changed from its usual white color to a light, red tone.

Witnessed the world over, the lunar eclipse of Oct. 27 drew students and members of the community to watch this special natural phenomenon through telescopes provided by the FIU Society of Physics Students.

"This turnout was fantastic," said Gregory Azarnia, a junior and president of the society. "I'm both surprised and very happy to see that so many people would take interest in this event." 

With several telescopes positioned around the platform, students got the opportunity to see the lunar eclipse up close, despite the clouds and city lights. Many brought blankets and food. Some took notepads for classes. Others simply arrived with a curiosity for something never seen before.

"It was a really good experience. I've never taken astronomy classes, but I was just really interested in knowing what the whole thing was about. A lot of my friends were talking about it," said Eric Erdvig, a freshman and anthropology major.

The physics department often holds several events and lectures throughout the year about astronomy, but there is currently no  astronomy department. Still, the few professors who do teach the course are happy with any interest the public shows in their field.

"This is an important event for everyone, not just science majors," said James Webb, one of only three astronomy professors at the university. "Its here that many students get their first views of Saturn, of the moon, of stars, of space, and that's something one always remembers."

Orlando Chirino, a member of the Southern Cross Astronomy Society, was also on hand to help students view the skies. An amateur astronomer's organization independent from FIU, Southern Cross uses university classrooms for meetings.

"Its important for students to study about the universe, and its important for this  university to help them with that study," Chirino said.

However, some complain that the university has not entirely helped  that quest.

"It bugs me that there isn't a better observatory we can use," Erdvig said. "A research university like this one should have that for its students."

Hearing of the complaints, Webb explained that the department once had an observatory, but it was closed because of fumes released by exhaust pipes from the chemistry labs. 

Astronomy classes met for some time on the grass outside the CP building until Provost Mark Rosenberg ordered the Observation Pad built, fearing that passing students might trip on the star-gazing equipment.

"This place is great, but we still have to deal with [extra] problems, especially since we have the construction in front of us," Webb said. The School of Nursing has been erected next to the platform and the lights from the new Red Parking Garage are, according to Webb and his students, a major obstacle to viewing a clear, night sky.

"We've been trying to get a new observatory for seven years, but we'll see what we can do for now. Any view of the sky we can get is still appreciated," Webb said.

Lunar eclipses occur when Earth's shadow stops sunlight from reflecting off the Moon. They can only occur during a full moon, and when it orbits the same plane of space as Earth's path around the Sun. Though four lunar eclipses have been seen within the last 18 months, there will not be another until 2007.

Subheadline: A message from the FIU College Democrats President
Author: James Valle / FIU College Democrats President
&nbsp;
Tomorrow is the day that will change all of our lives, Election Day 2004.  It's been a fun and rewarding experience for the College Democrats and me to promote John Kerry and educate the FIU community as to why he is the best candidate for president of the United States.  As college students, we have more riding on the line than any group of voters.

In the past four years, only 3 out of every 10 graduates have found work upon graduation. This is unacceptable and John Kerry has a better plan for us. He will eliminate tax credits for companies that ship jobs overseas and will provide a tax incentive for those that create good paying jobs here in America.  He will also eliminate tax cuts for those earning over $200,000 and keep tax cuts in place for the middle class.  

Kerry's plans to repeal the tax cut and the restructure government spending, will insure health coverage for 100 percent of children and 95 percent of adults. That is why he gives everyone the option of having the same health care that our elected officials get.

As for higher education, Kerry has a plan that gives all students the opportunity to get a college education. The Kerry administration will provide a fully refundable tax credit on $4000 of college tuition for anyone who dedicates two years of service to America, and it does not have to be military service. 

John Kerry will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror.  He will not take his eye of those who attacked us on 9/11.  

Coming from a man who voluntarily served his country in Vietnam when many ran from the call to fight, he has the bravery and experience to follow through with what he says. Kerry will work to repair relationships with our allies so that the war on terror can be properly fought on a global scale.

If you haven't already, take the time to vote for Senator Kerry.  Within hours we will have a new president-elect that will offer a change in direction for America to make us a much more prosperous, safer country.

Subheadline: A message from the FIU College Republicans President
Author: Juan F. D’Arce, Jr. / FIU College Republicans President
&nbsp;
Sometimes I wonder if people really understand what it feels like to live in a nation where democracy does not exist.  From experience I can tell you that this  is not easy.  This is why I value my right to vote and so should every U.S. citizen Our history is filled with displays of courage and heroism by men and women who gave their lives to assure that people in this nation could live free of fear, oppression, persecution, and in today's world: terrorism.

The presidential election of 2004 will be one of the most important elections in the new world of technology and international terror.  Issues like homeland security and the draft will play a major role in the votes of many.  For students, I think that this election may be the most crucial as they are the foundation for many things to come.

Homeland security is important, because, without it, people will revert to living in a state of disbelief and constant fear.  As we have learned, we have reached a sense of security by engaging the enemy head-on where they live and train.  This is not a popular policy as we are sending our military overseas to fight an enemy that is willing to hurt us all without remorse or hesitation.  Our military and intelligence community is basically utilizing a combination of containment and deterrence to keep us safe.  

They have managed to keep us terror-free within our borders since Sept. 11, 2001 and have managed to keep the terrorist running around in the other side of the world, creating a shield for us to enjoy.

Please remember to vote and to encourage your friends and family to do so.  We live in a great nation of dreams and realities.  It is a dream to think that we can fight terrorism within our borders. 

The reality is that we are better protected by fighting terror where terrorists live. With that said, please exercise your option to research the issues and the candidates.  Remember that the choices you make on November 2 will affect us all. Vote smart. Vote for President Bush.

Headline: Journalist criticizes elections, media
Author: Gretel Sarmiento / Contributing Writer
Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Dressed in a crisp suit, hair combed back and neat, prestigious journalist Carl Bernstein began his lecture Oct. 27 by stating his pleasure at being invited to FIU.

The SGA Lectures Committee, who wanted to focus on this year's presidential elections, invited Berstein as part of the annual Hearst Distinguished Lectures Series. 

Carl Bernstein, a former rock and music critic for the Washington Post, covered the Watergate scandal in 1972 with fellow journalist Robert Woodward. Their investigation of the connection between Nixon's administration and the break-in at the Democratic headquarters led to the president's eventual resignation.

Bernstein's bestselling books, "The Final Days" and "All the President's Men," narrate the experiences of the investigative team during the incident. The journalist won the 1973 Pulitzer Prize in reporting.

The Wolfe University Center Ballroom at Biscayne Bay was filled to capacity so much so that extra chairs were brought in to accomodate those standing.

Bernstein explained that the main question or concern in people's mind should not be if the next president is Republican or Democrat or Bush or Kerry, but if he has served the public.

He stated that the good of the public and overall truth during this presidency has to be a priority.

"I have never seen an administration like this one," Bernstein said. He added that the current presidency has tried to fool the people by feeding them lies and hiding facts.

According to Bernstein, many people are rightly concerned about the integrity of the upcoming presidential election. He called Florida's conduct during the last presidential election a national disgrace and said it is essential for our liberty that our election process be sacrosanct. 

Bernstein thinks the decline in political responsibility and the increasing abuses of the Constitution of the U.S. are parallel to the deterioration of good reporting, which he defined as the best obtainable version of the truth.

"This is the worst political campaign I've ever seen in terms of coverage," he said. 

Focusing his attacks on television, Bernstein says the media has lost sight of the idea of truth, which he said has now become disfigured, unreal and contaminated by celebrities and gossip. 

Berstein also added that the media's priority has become to entertain the public with opinions and judgments that have no basis and no context.

 "We are giving our readers what we think they want, what we calculate would sell," he said. "The media should present the truth first- only then can there be judgments and different opinions."

When an audience member asked about Michael Moore's 2004 "Fahrenheit 9/11," he  described it as a piece of political advocacy and propaganda imbued with good reporting that began to expose facts, objective or not. 

He urged the audience, as citizens of this nation, to demand "better and more," because that is precisely what he believes the population is not receiving. 

"This generation, which is so disconnected from the truth ... is willing to promote the acceptance of untruth in an embrace of the idiot culture," Bernstein said. He discusses this idea further in his article, "The Triumph of Idiot Culture."

Headline: Honors lecture to discuss stem cell controversy
Author: Cristela Guerra / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In hopes of addressing a major, current issue and to promote one of its latest programs, the Honors College will be hosting Dr. Paul Sanberg of the Universtiy of South Florida, one of the country's leading stem cell researchers. He will present his discourse, "Stem Cells For Brain Repair," as part of the Excellence Lecture Series. The event, co-sponsored by the College of Arts and Science, will be held Nov. 3 at University Park in GC 140.

Sanberg will address the idea of using stem cells to repair brain and spinal cord injuries that result in paralysis.

Sanberg has studied at York University in Toronto, the University of British Columbia  and  the Australian National University where he received a doctorate in neurological science. He currently works at Univerity of South Florida in the Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair.

"[The cells] form an amazing part of the body," said event organizer Lesley Northup, associate dean of the Honors College and associate professor of Religious Studies. "However, there is the question of where to get the stem cells. That is an important ethical question for many people."

Stem cells are normally found in all human beings. They are unique because in the embryonic stage, they can be turned into any of the 220 cells in the body, like heart cells and blood cells. Fertility clinics sometimes provide stem cells left over from in-vitro fertilization for research. The problem is that there is only a 10,000 or so nation-wide surplus of stem cells, and many believe this is not enough to continue advancing research.

"Until these issues are resolved and they stop being politicized or turned into campaign issues, they will not advance as a research," Northup said.

Sandberg's lecture will promote FIU's nascent medical school and the new premedical program held in cooperation with the University of South Florida and sponsored by the Honors College. It allows accepted premedical students to study at the USF School of Medicine in their senior year.

Yet, the Board of Governors is still considering the demand fora new South Florida medical school. 

"At this point we're still not sure," said Barbra Roller, advisor to premedical students. "However, if support is gained from the community, including local hospitals and doctors, as well as students willing to study in Miami, we will see."

Nevertheless, donors have begun to aid the cause. This summer FIU Board of Trustees member Nathan Wertheim donated a $10 million dollars to the school.

But FIU is not alone in its endeavor to attain a medical program - University of Central Florida and Florida Atlantic University also want Medical Schools.

 "We will have to do something to make us special if we wish to distinguish ourselves. The reasons are all there in terms of why Miami would be a good place to have [a medical school} , but in the end, it is up to whether they decide we need one," Roller said.

Headline: Dolphins snap men's soccer three game win streak
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers came to Jacksonville Oct. 26 riding on a three-game win-streak and looking for a fourth. Things did not go the team's way, as it was shutout 2-0. FIU's fifth leading scoring offense in the nation was put to sleep on the night. 

The Golden Panthers, who averaged 2.5 goals per game coming into the match, failed to score a goal for the third time this season. The loss drops FIU to 6-5-0 and improves Jacksonville's record to 8-6-1. The Dolphins went ahead in the 58th minute of the match, when sophomore Tommy Krizanovic found the back of the net from inside the box and recorded his 12th goal of the season, which is tops in the Atlantic-Sun Conference. Krizanovic's goal also proved to be his third game-winning score of the season. Jacksonville then added an insurance score during the 83rd minute on a loose ball that rolled away from FIU goalkeeper Shawn Crowe, which junior Brian Blackburn placed into the open net.

Although, the Golden Panthers out shot the Dolphins 15-12 during the game, they recorded only three shots on goal. Lucas Scudeler finished with one shot on goal and three shots total, FIU's lone-offensive highlight.

Jacksonville goalkeeper Greg Williams sealed the match with one save and recorded his second shutout of the season, while Crowe finished with four saves in a losing effort.

Headline: Quarter-life crisis leaves student wanting more from college, life
Author: Luis Nin / Illustrator
&nbsp;
This year, classes seem more difficult than ever before. Every week, I find myself either staying up late or waking up early to study. I'm buried up to my eyes in assignments, papers and exams. Behind every note I write and every fact I learn, there is this terrible feeling of emptiness. 

I keep wondering if the path I'm choosing to follow will even make me happy. I'm going through something most college students experience; I'm considering changing my major.

The classes I'm taking aren't fulfilling or enlightening. I never leave a class feeling like I accomplished something. They feel like the academic equivalent of jumping through hoops and over hurdles, just a bunch of pointless exercises in tediousness.

I'm majoring in biology, a  subject that I'm not passionate about in order to get a job that I'll probably hate. But, I want to make good money, and I don't want to let down my family, my friends, and myself. It feels like I'm going through some sort of quarter-life crisis. I guess that's something like a mid-life crisis, only earlier. It was never like this when I began college.

When I first enrolled at FIU, I felt like I could conquer the world, nothing could have stopped me. I would sit through soul-destroying, sleep-inducing classes like World Nutrition and actually take notes and pay attention. 

I felt passionate about science and math. I thought that the secrets of the universe were hidden inside of my physics textbook.

Slowly but surely, I became disillusioned. The classes started to seem trivial in the grand scheme of things. The lectures were boring and uninspiring. Like most of my classmates, I stopped attending my science classes and opted to study at home using my textbook and the course's online webpage, following along with the instructor. I began to lose faith in academia.

My fire for learning that was once there has burnt out, and I feel like a miserable failure. At this point, I'm beginning to doubt myself. Maybe nothing will make me happy. If mind-numbing classes could kill my passion for science, surely they could do the same for any other major I pursue.

It's a really tough decision that is going to cost me years of my life if I make the wrong choice. Most college students are at a crossroads in their lives, every one of them hesitant to step in any particular direction. 

It's terrible to think that choosing the wrong major and making the wrong decision can potentially ruin the rest of your life. It cripples you. But, allowing yourself to be crippled by fear and self-doubt is probably the worst decision a person can make. 

Sometimes you just need to say, "F*** it!", close your eyes, hold your breath and take the plunge. I'm going to change my major. 

If in five years you find me behind the cash register of your local McDonalds, at least I won't still be at FIU trying to make up my mind. And hell, I'll super-size your value meal for free.

Headline: Supernatural thriller horrifies audiences
Author: Heather Brummer / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind." At least that's what Sarah Michelle Gellar's character said in her latest film, "The Grudge." The film is an eerie tale of a young social worker (Gellar) who visits Japan as an exchange student and gets more than she bargained for when she covers for a nurse who didn't show up for work one day. 

The supernatural thriller is set in a creepy house with only Gellar and a catatonic woman (Grace Zabriskie) and revolves around a curse that kills people in cycles while becoming increasingly powerful. 

"The Grudge" follows a film trend - Japanese horror movie remakes. It began with, "The Ring" a successful adaptation of Japan's "Ringu," and it has continued to grow as audiences have embraced similar films. 

Takashi Shimizu, writer and director of "The Grudge," said that "Ringu" influenced him. He saw it as a film student and said it inspired him to make a horror movie completely different from anything he had seen before. 

He began with two short films that garnered him attention from people in high places. One of these was "Ju On," which screenwriter Stephen Succor would later translate into "The Grudge." 

Translating foreign films has been relatively successful, but what about this movie? There seems to be no straight and narrow here as it hits and misses. The film is composed of frightening scenes that catch the audience off guard at some points. Yet, it lacks the underlying terror we have come to expect in good horror movies. 

The best way to describe "The Grudge" is to compare it to a book of scary stories - each scene frightens you (some more than others), but the outcome is mediocre at best. 

"The Grudge" does contain some genuinely scary parts. There are many scenes when you'll jump because you're not sure if something just passed by or if you imagined the whole thing. 

After the movie, there are many things to be afraid of. Mirrors take on a new meaning. You'll want to stay as far as possible away from the bathtub and the entire second story of the house is off-limits. 

The long, dark hair of one of the ghosts seems to take on a life of its own. You don't have to see her face in order to flinch. And that head of hair shows up when you least expect it.  The cinematographic effects are psychologically thrilling and work well.

 Even after you discover the ending, something is missing. We understand what the curse is and how it happened, but still something is lacking. Furthermore, casting a film is an art and, although Buffy is one hell of a vampire slayer, it's difficult to see her as a terrified social worker.

Those who work at the Information Desk at the Biscayne Bay Campus' Wolfe University Center held what they hope will become an annual costume contest. 

The event, hosted by a French maid and a gangster straight out of Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" video, was sponsored by Bank of America. 

The event kicked off with a mummy competition, in which teams of two had to wrap each other in toilet paper before the music stopped. 

Winners received Blockbuster gift cards. FIU's Golden Star Dancers followed, to the tune of Michael Jackson's "Thriller." The five dancers dressed as zombies and later entered the costume contest.

About 50 students watched the competition. Only seven students competed in the contest besides Golden Star Dancers. The other contestants included a knight and a Navy captain.

The captain said she was competing to honor all her friends fighting over seas. 

"[The] turnout could have been better," said Steven James, one of the contests' hosts. "We needed people to come out."

The contestants modeled onstage amid the leftover toilet paper. After the contest, there was a Halloween question and answer session. 

Questions included: Where did Halloween originate? (Ireland) How many "witches" were killed in the Salem witch trials? (19) What is Wicca phobia? (Fear of witches)

The dancers won by audience applause. They shared a $50 gift certificate to the bookstore.

With the Miami Book Fair approaching, South Floridians will get the chance to go out, relax, tap their feet and snap their fingers at The Spoken Word Café. 

The Book Fair will be from Nov. 7-14. Beginning on Monday evening, The Spoken Word Café will be located in a tent in Wolfson Park on Miami Dade College's Wolfson Campus. Each weeknight at 6:30 p.m. and all day Saturday and Sunday beginning at 10:30 a.m., listeners may hear authors read thier work and listen to live music. 

Lissette Mendez, program coordinator at the Florida Center for the Literary Arts, is coordinating the event. She has enlisted downtown's Miami Transit Lounge to provide live music, which will follow the authors' readings in constant rotation. 

"I want listeners to come away from the Spoken Word Café with a bigger idea of story than when they came in. They will be inspired by the mix of work and the liveliness of writers at all stages of their careers, mixing it up, sharing the stage," Mendez said.

There will be quite a few writers from Florida International University on hand at the fair. Denise Duhamel, assistant professor of poetry will read from his poetry collaboration, "Oyl," about Popeye's love interest, written with friend Maureen Seaton. 

"My friend and collaborator, [Maureen], is a collector of all things Olive Oyl-she has book bags and combs and t-shirts, all with images of Olive Oyl," Duhamel says. 

It was because of Seaton that Duhamel became hooked on Olive Oyl and thus, they created their book. 

The event is free, and the Spoken Word Café should give you the chance to soak up great literature and music.
