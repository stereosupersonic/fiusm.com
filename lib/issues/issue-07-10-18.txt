Headline: Students learn to think clean and go green: Green resource fair promotes environmental consciousness
Author: Eddith Sevilla / BBC Managing Editor
&nbsp;
In an effort to help students be environmentally friendly, the Wolfe University Center Go Green Committee held a green resource fair on Oct. 16 at Biscayne Bay Campus' WUC.

"Every year the Wolfe University Center picks a theme and this year we picked 'Go Green,'" said Zach K. Trautenberg, IT/marketing specialist for WUC and chair of the WUC Go Green Committee. "[We have] more information available for students to make their lives more green and environmentally friendly."

Different vendors from the community and the University presented ways in which students can become more environmentally friendly.

"We're trying to get students to become aware of recycling, reusing and reducing waste. Mainly we're focusing on recycling," said Maria Marasigan, a graduate student and teacher's assistant of the Ecology of South Florida class being taught at BBC.

Marasigan and the students in her class are creating a proposal to present to the University's administration that would include the benefits of recycling, the costs to contract companies for recycling pick-ups and a map of high-traffic areas that could be key locations for recycling bins.

"We're trying to help [the administration] in their planning by providing them with information to help them meet their goals," Marasigan said.

Organizations such as Kopali Organic, Waste and Water management, Outdoors Adventure Klub, Urban Environment League Friends of the Everglades and Campus Ministry presented different environmentally friendly resources.

Kopali Organic offered organic foods, face creams and shampoos as alternatives to regular items, while Waste and Water management offered efficient ways to use tap water and tips on how to conserve water. The South Florida Commuter Services offered carpooling, transit services and the Emergency ride home Program, in which students who carpool, bike, or use transit are eligible for free taxi rides in the event of an emergency, as other transportation options.  

"It's all about getting students to think that being environmentally friendly can be fun and still have the same qualities as regular everyday products," Trautenberg said.

During the resource fair, the WUC Go Green committee announced the winners of the Go Green Student art contest, which kicked off Sept. 10.

Nickson Lubin, a freshman majoring in environmental studies, won second place for his drawing, which presented a polluted environment and a healthy habitat.

"I want the viewers to be able to understand that they need to make a wise decision knowing that they are the main source of the problem or the solution," Lubin said.

Lubin received a $30 gift certificate to the campus' cafeteria.

The first place winner, Freya Evangelista who was not present, will receive a $50 bookstore gift certificate.

Despite the green initiatives, there are students who are already going green.

"I just started recycling. Now at this place that I moved into, they give you the [option] of recycling rather than taking it somewhere else," said Jazmin Campos, a junior majoring in international business. "One person can't change the world, but what I do can affect my surroundings and that's what counts."

Headline: Vegetarians, others, find sanctuary at Garden of Eatin'
Author: Yezi Giraldo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
While there's no movement more proactive for our generation than health, it's over priced and sometimes tasteless food that keeps meat eating students stickin' to chicken…till now.  In the crevices of Miami sits a tiny unsung hero to vegetarian cuisine.

The Garden of Eatin' is a small restaurant and juice bar refreshingly different from your everyday vegetarian joint. 

Hidden amongst mom-and-pop shops on Martin Luther King Blvd., the island-like restaurant shines with the proudly hand-painted red, gold, and green colors of Africa with walls decorated with illustrations of Haile Slassie I of Ethiopia and his queen.

The 3-year-young eatery serves a range of animal-free, dairy-free, and even white sugar-free feasts, such as black-eyed pea soup and soy fish with spinach. 

The food is prepared from the restaurant's surrounding gardens filled with veggies and ingredients such as pumpkin and lemongrass. These items celebrate flavor without the need of animal products.

As for the juice bar, it consists of a few drinks that are homemade like the spicy ginger root drink or the sweet brown sugar lemonade.

The two biggest complaints I have heard amongst students attempting a vegetarian lifestyle is the cost and the usually unfilling, flavorless food options. The Garden of Eatin' is a restaurant where you can feed two people under seven dollars. 

The food is high in quality, quantity, and affordability. You just order that day's special: Small $5 dish or large $7 dish. The generous portions and prices set you up to try an assortment of rice and beans, pasta and tofu, soy fish, veggies, and the menu continues on, varying each day with the chef's taste buds.

People come to partake not only in the diverse dinning but to enjoy the entertainment as well.

Students may encounter a variety of occurrences, such as meeting the DJ as he mixes Island music, catch sight of a random pet chicken in the gardens, or chat with some friendly neighbors. Outdoors sits a small, wooden staged area where some of the many events are held throughout the week. 

Students come from Miami-Dade College to perform and watch local talent in a hot, cultural environment. For a minute you truly feel as if you've had a piece of …peace. 

Reggae music, home-cooked food, a more than affordable tab, entertainment, and laid-back people in a Caribbean influenced setting.

So if you're tired of those typical tasteless and overpriced health food spots, try this tropical twist on tofu. 

This small, modest restaurant has entertainment, culture, and flavor you don't often come across when eatin' meat free. The Garden of Eatin' promotes healthy living with a little seasoning and coconut milk.

Headline: Faiths Unite: Discussion on Religious Harmony Event
Author: Kassandra Elizee / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Despite being two men of different faiths, Catholic Bishop Justo Laguna from Argentina, and North Miami Beth Torah's Rabbi Mario Rojzman are friends. They discussed the evolution of their relationship in a book titled All Roads Lead to Jerusalem…and Also to Rome at the Biscayne Bay Campus' Mary Ann Wolfe Theatre on Oct. 9. 

"Ten years ago, the family members of those people killed in the terror attacks of the Jewish Federation Argentina in 1994 and the Israeli Embassy in Argentina in 1992 asked the Bishop to open his Cathedral for a mass, honoring the souls of the people who were murdered," Rabbi Rojzman said, regarding how he met Bishop Laguna.

According to Rojzman, upon receiving this request from the families, Laguna told them he didn't understand why he should do a catholic mass when they could have an inter-religious service, since the people who had passed away were not exclusively Catholic or Jewish, but both. Laguna then asked Rojzman to be the Rabbi for the special service, and thus began their friendship.

The bishop and the rabbi spoke of their views on inter-faith understanding during the free one-hour event that attracted almost a hundred students and residents from the community. An 8-minute multimedia presentation of the rabbi and the bishop showed images of where the two had been together and their journey.

 After collaborating on the special service in Argentina, Laguna asked Rojzman to come to Rome and visit the Vatican. Rabbi Rojzman answered "Only with a condition, if you join me first in Jerusalem, because everything started there." 

Six weeks later, the two friends were celebrating the 50th anniversary of Israel in Jerusalem, Rojzman said.

When asked what message he wanted to get through to people in his book, Rabbi Rojzman answered, "The main message is that every religious library has books that invite to hatred, to bigotry but also books to respect, to love, to tolerance and to understand that there is beauty in every religion."

The rabbi and bishop first traveled to Jerusalem in 1998, where they visited the Western Wall, also called the Wailing Wall, where Jews come to pray. The video that was screened followed them from there, to Rome, where they went to St. Peters Square, and met Pope John Paul II.

Their journey then continued to Villa Dolorosa, which is known as the path where Jesus walked on the way to crucifixion, and ended at the Holy Sepulcher, where, according to the Bible, Jesus was buried and then came back to life.

"The video was prepared through friendship and brotherhood," Bishop Laguna emphasized.

One of the main subjects discussed by the Priest and the Rabbi was the need and importance of dialogue between religions. 

"As a Catholic, I'm very enthusiastic for understanding [of other religions]. Without dialogue, peace is impossible," Laguna said.

He also spoke of his experience in Israel.

 "Seeing how many children died in the Holocaust, we have to maintain the memory so that it never happens again," Laguna said.

Bryan Villagran, a student majoring in Theatre Production, said he learned something from the event. 

"Probably the main thing I've learned was how there's actually people still committed, and they are more united, the three different religions [Islam, Judaism and Christianity]."

North Miami Beach residents Joe Dooley and his wife Esther were there to hear the Bishop and the Rabbi's discussion on religious harmony.

"Just in the newspaper yesterday [Miami Herald], I saw the announcement of this and I thought it would be quite interesting if we came over, and this was marvelous. My only regret is that more people don't know this." Dooley comments.

Leaha Widrowicz, program director for Hillel Second Generation, was satisfied with the outcome of event.

 "One of our goals with this is to connect with the FIU community. We want people to know that we're a Jewish organization, and we believe that faiths should unite. I am fully satisfied when faiths come together and learn about one another," Widrowicz said.

She further stated that FIU is one of the main schools that Hillel Second Generation works with. "FIU is where most of our students attend so we assumed that the best place to have it [the event] would be at the school where most of our students attend."

Headline: The Fetish Factor
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Lingerie may do the trick for some, but for others, sexy feet are what count in the bedroom. Call it kinky or weird, but the proper term is paraphilia, what psychologists call sexual fetishism. 


Fetishism defined:
Fetishism falls into the category of paraphilias, also known as sexual deviations or perversions. It's defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-IV Edition as sexual urges or behaviors associated with non-living objects that are necessary for arousal.

According to Marilyn Volker, adjunct professor of psychology, a fetish can take the form of an object, image, part of the body or activity. 

This object of fetishism then becomes necessary for someone to have sexual desire, orgasm or stay in a relationship. 

Sometimes, the person will masturbate while holding, smelling, rubbing or fantasizing about the object; other people will struggle with urges or desires but will not act on them. 

Paraphilias are far more common in men than in women, with the ratio being about 20 males to one female, though it is not understood why.



What's Your pleasure?



Anything is fair game to develop into a fetish.

 Fetishes with body parts are fairly common: hair, feet or legs. Some fetishes are particular to a culture or society, such as large breasts in North American cultures.

"Some people in different countries think we are weird - and if we were born or raised in those countries - I imagine we would be thinking the same thing for focusing so much on breasts," Volker said.

Other times fetishes can take the form of a sound or particular act - dirty talk or role playing perhaps, according to Volker.

 But the most common fetishes are object fetishes, with some more common ones including women's underwear, bras, stockings or shoes. 

According to www.discoverhealth.com, it is unknown how common fetishes are because paraphiliacs rarely get treatment for their disorder because it would mean giving up something immensely pleasurable.

According to Volker, some fetishes can be the result of specific relationships between a child and parent. 

Freudian examples would be a child with an abusive parent becoming a sadist or masochist, or a child who experienced invasive potty training developing a love for anal sex. 

Other instances that Volker says can lead to the development to fetishes are post traumatic rape victims needing rape fantasies to orgasm or veterans with post tramatic war experiences developing violent fetishes. 

Fetishism can also result from conditioning in adolescence if an object becomes associated with masturbation.

"Some just grow from play, [or] sexual games, where a certain toy or experience is interpreted sexually in the brain and needed for some part of sexual expression," Volker said.





When fetishism 

becomes a problem



Fetishism becomes a problem when a person cannot become aroused without the desired fetish.

"If it gets in the way of going to work, etc, it is good to go to someone who is not going to be judgmental but is going to be helpful in sorting out all the variables and then help reframe [the person's] fantasies [or] activities," Volker said.

Graduate student Rosa Ortiz believes fetishes could interfere with daily functions and relatonships.

"Maybe if it gets out of hand, then the partner will initiate getting help," Ortiz said.

According to Liane Dornheim, a psychologist at University Psychological Counseling Services, says fetishists usually only seek treatment when their partner cannot handle the obsession, or when the fetish gets the person into trouble with the law.

When fetishism reaches this level, treatment usually entails traditional psychoanalysis to determine where and how the fetish developed, behavior therapy to recondition the individual and even hypnosis. Treatment has been shown to be successful if it is long term and combines drug therapy with behavioral therapy.

 But if your fetish doesn't bother you or anyone else, there's no reason to be ashamed, said Juliette Mayi, a graduate student. 

"If it's something harmless then whatever, if you want to smell my feet,  - go for it," Mayi said.

Headline: Road rage tips for traffic turmoil
Author: Shannon Fallon / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If screaming obscenities at the 65-year-old lady driving a school bus is part of your daily routine, then you may be suffering from a condition that many other locals also experience: road rage, also known as interstate indignation, automotive anger or freeway fury.

"I could lay on the horn for hours when someone really pisses me off when I'm driving", said student Jay Morales, who admits to occasional bouts of aggressive driving. 

The American Automobile Association (AAA) defines aggressive driving as the practice of driving without regard for others' safety. Tailgating, honking and screaming obscenities out your window while waving "the finger" are just a few of the actions taken by those in the throes of road rage. 

Those suffering from road rage have helped contribute to an increase in traffic collisions, according to studies from the AAA.

According to the AAA, road rage can be caused by traffic congestion, long commutes to and from work and the daily stresses of living in today's society. 

People with road rage are likely to be under high levels of stress and pressure. According to FIU psychologist Liane Dornhiem, people who engage in actions of road rage "do not have good coping skills [when] their emotions turn to anger." Enraged drivers practice hostile aggressive thinking, looking for revenge which can lead to risky driving. 

Actions of impulsiveness and anxiety can be triggered from a number of stressful environments like home, school, the office, or merely just a bad day, which can lead to destructive driving. 

Raven Morales is a hard working junior. She attends a full load of classes throughout the week and spends much of her time either in the library or in her office.

"I can't be late in the mornings and if I am, there's hell to pay," she said. "So you can say I turn a little vicious on the road. If I know I'm going to be late, I do whatever it is I have to do in order to be on time. So if cutting someone off or tailgating in order to miss the red light will get me to school on time, then I'll do it." 

If you share in Morales' sentiments, follow some of these cognitive and relaxation techniques to calmly and safely arrive at your destination.

Get up. If your class starts at 9 a.m. and FIU is 30 minutes away from home, do not leave your home at 8:30 a.m; leave earlier to avoid the frustrations of traffic and being late. Laura Davis, a junior and resident of Coral Gables, lives by this rule.

"I have to leave extra early in the morning so I give myself time to get to school and to find parking without being annoyed," Davis said.

Dornhiem suggests that when feelings of anger begin to rise, people should take slow, deep breaths and count down from 20 or even 30 depending on how high the anger level is. Deep breathing helps relieve tension in the muscles while lowering your heart rate. 

Listen to music that is soothing. You don't have to listen to Kenny G, but any music that leaves you calm and happy can help you avoid descending into anger. Avoid the kind of music you listen to that gets your adrenaline pumping. 

Talk radio shows are popular for morning commutes that feature great discussions that are both entertaining and fun. 

Sarah Morgan, a sophomore, does not take traffic problems personally. She became infuriated when she was cut off by a white Mustang and chased after it. She now regrets her course of action. "I felt like an idiot when I went to give her the finger and realized it was my neighbor," she said.

Headline: Business club serves as arena for applying skills
Author: Elsa Reinoso / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Preparing members for life in the business world is the main goal for Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda.

Currently, FBLA-PBL is the largest non-profit national organization and includes more than 12,000 students and 1000 advisors in 500 campuses. At FIU, the organization has 17 active members and 37 potential members. 

The club seeks to promote networking among the business community as well as opportunities to improve one's skills such as public speaking.

Christina Rodriguez, FBLA-PBL secretary and a finance major, said that when she heard that FIU was going to have an FBLA chapter, she knew she wanted to become a part of it. 

"I was a part of FBLA throughout most of my high school career, it is truly a special club for me," she said. "When I was presented with the idea of being a part of FBLA at FIU, I instantly jumped onboard to become part of it."

According to FBLA-PBL President Abdel Perera, the organization is the collegiate level of the national organization and is often mistaken for a greek organization. 

"There is a big misconception that Phi Beta Lamba is a fraternity, it's not." Perera said.

For Lilian Dennis, executive vice president, the networking opportunity of meeting people from all over the world is what she likes the most about the organization. 

"We travel, develop business and social skills and get recognized if we win at conferences," Dennis said. "We also meet other students and share common experiences. There, we also get connections."

Each year, the state and national levels of FBLA-PBL choose a philanthropy theme to promote community services.

"This year we will work with the Susan G. Komen Fight for Breast Cancer Walk and American Veterans," Perera said.

Perera added that the organization expects to compete in early February at the organization's district levels in different competitions such as public speaking, business ethics, community service and international business. 

He also said that the members who place the first place at the district level will then compete at the state level against schools such as the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Miami.

"Students should look at this organization as an arena to implement what they have learned in the classroom and get rewarded for their educational endeavors," Perera said.

Dennis said that FBLA-PBL is especially important for students who are considering being business leaders in the future because every student needs a base in business for anything.

Students can become part of this organization as long as long as a 2.0 GPA is maintained and payment for the state and national dues of $30 is received. 

The organization believes that there are business standards in every field, so it does not limit membership based on one's major.

"I am a political science and international relations double major and I have been involved in this organization since my ninth grade of high school," Perera said. "The organization is open to every minor, major or certificate program. [It's open] to anyone."

The organization does not have an assigned office for potential members to visit, but membership is open to students at all campuses and officers can be contacted at www.fbla-pbl.org.

"Being in an institution geared by fraternities and sororities most of the time restrict the ability of most students at FIU to get involved," Perera said. "FBLA-PBL would allow those students who are left out to come out, support and represent FIU at the local, state and national level."

Aside from the GPA and dues requirements, potential members need to have a go-getter mentality and be ready for competition.

"[FBLA] has given me the opportunity to grow not only professionally, but socially as well," Dennis said.

Headline: WHAT LIES BENEATH: Center analyzes otherworldly specimens
Author: Hema Persaud / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Hundreds of students walk over the Primera Casa stairs every day not even imagining that a few feet below, scientists are using complex equipment to analyze a variety of samples.

A sign warns passers-by about radiation and a security buzzer marks the isolated entrance to PC 50, where the Florida Center for analytical Electronic Mycroscopy is located. 

Since 2001, this National Science Foundation-funded center has provided and supported academic as well as commercial research in microanalysis throughout Florida and throughout the nation.

In the past, FCAEM has done a variety of research including assisting in the research of the geology of a rock from Mars.

Barbara Maloney, the center's research engineer suport specialist, also recently  examined the fur of a dead dog's remains that traveled from Argentina.

"We were only partially successful in that we were not set up to do a thorough examination, but we were able to image some parts of a few specimens discovered in the fur," Maloney said.

Microanalysis is a form of experimentation performed at the center, a process where structures too small for the human eye to see are magnified and then analyzed through microscopes.

Gautam Sen, professor of earth sciences for the past 23 years, was the one who proposed the founding of the FCAEM to the NSF.

"The idea of FCAEM came from the goal of servicing and developing a facility for all of Florida," Sen said.

Besides being used for classes and research, FCAEM provides services to outside users who don't have the capacity or funding to set up a center on their own for microscopy.

A company or university can send their physical samples to FCAEM and specify the time they want to perform their research by selecting a time on the calendar on FCAEM's Web site. FCAEM will then set up the sample in the chambers of the instruments in the allotted time. The university or company can then access that sample on its own computers via the remote session.

Jeffrey Ryan, professor and assistant chair of the Department of Geology at the University of South Florida in Tampa is a frequent user of FCAEM. He was involved in FCAEM from its inception and has used it via its remote session to teach classes to his students at USF. He is currently teaching three of the classes through FCAEM: an introductory natural sciences course, a junior-level geology course on mineralogy and petrology and a senior-level laboratory.

"What FCAEM offers for me is ideal - instrumentation I can use in both my research and my courses that gives me high-quality data, but doesn't come hand-in-hand with the headaches of "owning" it yourself," Ryan said.

However, this comes with a price, which is determined by the type of industry - academic or commercial -, which machine is used and the time of the day it is to be used. Prices range from $20 an hour to a maximum of $1000 for 10 hours.

But the price is not an issue for the researchers who use these instruments.

"I'm happy to pay to help upkeep the FCAEM facility commensurate with my level of use. That's the way we all manage our analytical systems, really - we're all pretty open about other users, but we need to cover the [related] costs of their use," Ryan said.

FCAEM has two unique research instruments chosen by Sen and his colleague Thomas Beasley, engineer at FCAEM, after visiting manufacturers in both Paris and Tokyo and then settling on the Japanese brand JEOL.

One of these instruments is the electron probe micro-analyzer, known as EPMA microprobe. This machine identifies and provides very accurate chemical analysis of small objects placed in its chamber without either physically destroying or chemically altering them. It picks up elements from Boron to Uranium. EPMA is the only instrument of its class in Florida, according to Beasley.

The other instrument is the environmental scanning electron microscope, known as SEM, which provides magnification through two types of imaging: the secondary electron image (SEI) and the back- scatter electron image (BEI). It provides analysis for a wide range of materials ranging from soft tissues to hard rocks.

One of the features of these instruments is the ability to be remotely accessed by outside universities and companies via the Internet. Many universities, such as USF, University of Miami, University of Florida and the University of Rochester in Rochester , N.Y.have all used FCAEM for microscopy via a remote session.

"A unique quality about our system is that it is the only system in the whole nation that can provide service through a remote session," Sen said.

In August, following Maloney's persistence and negotiation, the center received two new instruments donated by Tronox Inc., a company in Savannah, Ga. These include a transmission electron microscope, or TEM, and another scanning electron microscope, known as SEM.

The TEM analyzes materials such as plant cells, tissues and human cells, providing detail and going down to a very fine structure on hard material samples.

The SEM, which is a high brightness gun, provides high quality pictures. However, because of the FCAEM's limited space in PC, the two recently acquired instruments are currently located in Viertes Haus, where they are in the process of being installed. However, FCAEM is currently looking to expand its area in PC 50 to accommodate them, Sen said.

FCAEM directors plan to allow high school students interested in sciences to have access to the center's research through the Internet. This, they hope, will expand their knowledge and interest in microscopy and maybe bring them to FIU.

"We would connect their lab computers via a remote session to FCAEM so they can see the samples under our microscopes," Beasley said. "Imagine a student being able to see this!"

Headline: Computer Science: Programing team not 'world's smartest'
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
The third time didn't prove to be a charm for FIU in this year's "battle of the brains"

FIU competed Oct. 13 for the third time in the 32nd annual Association for Computing Machinery International Collegiate Programming Contest with less than desirable results.

Sponsored by IBM, ACM-ICPC is a prestigious worldwide competition for aspiring computer programming students in which teams of students try to solve problems by creating computer programs. 

"It was a pretty tough contest and we definitely have work to do this year," said Kip Irvine, instructor of computer science and a coach for this year's ACM-ICPC.

Though the results have not yet been posted on the ACM-ICPC Web site due to a power failure during the competition, Irvine thinks FIU came in 38 place out of 54 teams. Last year, FIU took seventh and 17 places.

The poor standings didn't stem from a lack of effort - FIU students had been practicing for the competition since May 2006 under coaches Irvine and Hien Nguyen, Miami-Dade community college professor in the department of computer information systems, and doctorate student at FIU.

Rather, Irvine and Nguyen felt the judging was problematic this year because students were not told why or how their programs failed, making it difficult to fix the problems. 

Some of the team's problems could have also just been nerves, says Nguyen.

"Sometimes, you know how to do things and when it comes to the test, you forget. That's what happened to these kids," Nguyen said.

FIU's teams didn't get to take home the "world's smartest" trophy this year but a few students were granted internships and all of the students learned from the experience, Irvine said.

"At first I think they were kind of bummed out but I think, all in all, they recognize that they have learned a lot," Irvine said. 

Just because this year's competition is over doesn't mean there isn't work to be done. Nguyen wants to get back to work, recruiting and practicing to be better prepared for next year's competition.

Headline: STARVING STUDENTS: The high price of eating from our vending machines
Author: Veronica Trueba / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"Our reputation, quality prompt friendly service, commitment to excellence, and strong financial resources has enabled us to experience consistent growth in a highly competitive marketplace," claims DiLoreto & Sons Web site, the purveyor of our very familiar and lately, not that effective, vending machines.

But while our vending machine service is supposed to take pride in so called excellent service and commitment to the client, a lot of students at FIU seem to think otherwise. 

"I was on my way to class and I was starving. I didn't have time to go to the cafeteria so I thought I'd just catch something from one of the vending machines," said sophomore Tania Santiago, "But I put my money in hoping to get a bag of chips and I got absolutely nothing!" 

Problems like this seem to be very common at FIU these days. Students are in a hurry to get something to eat or to drink, they put in their money and after realizing they're not going to get what they purchased, they are left with the frustrating and uncomfortable feeling that they have been deliberately stolen from. 

Vending machines are an important part of several students' daily meal plan. According to FIU's Web site they can be found in "administrative buildings, student housing areas and recreational facilities." Moreover, the products on some of the machines can even be purchased with a Panther Card, which can be helpful to a lot of students. That is, if they actually work.

"I used to hang around the dorms a lot and at first, I always bought food from the vending machines," said sophomore Tony Gutierrez. "But then from time to time the machines would swallow my money and not give anything back, that's when I decided to start getting my food in a nearby Publix and not take any chances."

At the moment, the trouble with the vending machines is not entirely clear. 

After calling the Customer Service line of DiLoreto & Sons, one is informed that, "Machines taking in the money and not vending is the company's most common problem", according to costumer assistant Stacey Rodriguez. However, when she was asked what she thought the problem might be, she replied that she did not know and that a University representative would have to contact the company in order to have a technician look at the problem. 

But in the meantime, students have an alternative to just sitting around waiting for the machines to be repaired. According to another costumer assistant at DiLoreto hotline, Patt Thomas, "students or University representatives should call 1-800-432-0626 extension 268, in order to get their money back."

There are also refund banks on both FIU campuses. According to FIU regulations, "If you experience any problems with the vending machines or have any suggestions, please contact Business Services, DC 100, at (305) 348-2187, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m." 

According to Business Services representative Ingrid Trapp, "Whenever there are problems with the vending machines, each department lets us know and we instantly report the problem to the vending provider."  However, some students keep complaining that the vending machines continuously steal their money. 

Students like freshman Jamal Garcia complain after several exasperated attempts to get a soda he had just purchased from one of the FIU vending machines, "I cannot believe this is happening again, I have already had problems with these machines and I'm telling you, I'm not going to be buying stuff from them again." 

So, for now, FIU students who rely on vending machines for their daily meals, have limited alternatives, they can either wait and hope they get repaired; take a chance and hope and pray the machines will vend when they put in their money; or finally, having their money swallowed by the machine and then calling one of the refund lines, hoping and praying that they will return their money.

Headline: Bullies, mental instability to blame in school shooting
Author: Joseph Marhee / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
At the SuccessTech Academy in Cleveland, Ohio, parents are in an outrage because metal detector officers did not notify them that a suspended student, Asa H. Coon had indeed brought multiple firearms and other weapons into the one-time office building.

However, SuccessTech Academy did absolutely nothing to protect their students, especially Coon, from physical and psychological trauma; and whether or not the reciprocation was appropriate, they're paying the price for their ignorance.

According to multiple accounts, Coon was definitely bullied. It's always the parents of the bullies who try to paint a picture of an eccentric manic-depressive gunman with no motive for "killing their babies."  However true the allegations of mental illness are in this case, Coon certainly had a motive: he stood through years of physical and psychological anguish, the school wouldn't defend him so it was up to him to defend himself. 

 Coon, who went on a shooting spree systematically through each floor of the building and taking his own life at the end of the rampage, was described as 'gothic,' as vague descriptions were given by one unnamed classmate, "[He] Wore black…dog collar…wore this trench coat in any weather."  

One could imagine the white teen in a predominantly black school was "different enough as it was," but he  was further alienated by his stylistic choices.

In most school shooting cases, the shooter is often put through a cycle of physical harm and psychological trauma. 

Many accounts label Coon as a 'loner' (an assumption given to almost every school shooter since Columbine) only having one or two 'friends' at the most, one of which he confided in about the shooting. Had the friend been more intuitive, he would have spoken to a school counselor. But Coon's odd behavior was nothing new, and the entire incident could have been prevented. 		To start, while not at all condoning Coon's actions, the obvious mental instability present was more than enough to substantiate Coon's state of mind being called into question. Accordingly, the many teachers and school officials who had either heard Coon make these threats on countless occasions or had to break up confrontations between Coon and other students should have reported the pugilistic behavior trouble and reported it to the school counselor.

Another factor leading to Coon's predetermining 'snap' would be the fact that he was allowed back to SuccessTech after being removed from his mother's custody in 2006 to live in a Family Services shelter where he tried to commit suicide. 

His actions in school grew more troubling after, possibly because he needed to be institutionalized.

 Coon received psychological treatment in 2006 but was uncooperative. Committing him to an asylum would have been a more effective course of action.

Knowing all of this information about Coon, the school should have had the foresight to tell that Coon would reciprocate when he was suspended, not only because of his past violent behavior, but because several students Coon confided in told the principal what Coon had said.

But this wouldn't be the first instance of Coon being ignored by the apathetic school: He was constantly bullied and sought after to appear as though he was the cause of a problem, just to 'mess with' Coon.

"I ain't justifying nothing," a friend told CNN affiliate WOIO. "I ain't saying he did the right thing but I am saying he got pushed for a long time and asked them people to help, help, help, help, but nobody helped."

 A testimony like that, had Coon not taken his own life, would most definitely been used in Coon's trial, because however horrific, Coon acted in his own defense.

The parents of Coon's attackers need to realize their part in this-it's not just the 'loner' who needs to be locked up, sometimes it takes an equally unstable person to bully someone the way Coon was bullied. 

If Coon hadn't gone through beatings and taunting on a daily basis, would he have been driven to his breaking point? From a logical standpoint, probably not.

While Coon is by no stretch of the imagination a sane or stable person, he was a victim of circumstance: his psyche shattered by years of obvious trauma, his classmates shunned and pummeled him, and the one beacon of hope and protection, the SuccessTech Academy, wanted nothing to do with him. 

How is it that in schools of thousands, one eccentric student can be observed, but in a school of 240, the one with a staggering and visible mental illness goes unnoticed.

Headline: Entrepreneurial club helps job-hunting
Author: David A. Barrios / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Of the several reasons students' parents send their kids to college, one is the hope that their children will get a well-paying job after graduation. 

Although they're not parents, leaders of the new Up and Coming Entrepreneurial Leaders club want FIU students to be able to get a job, too.

"We want FIU's students to harness their resources and embrace their entrepreneurial spirit and, ultimately, we want UCEL to make a different between getting a job and not," Ayman Al-Abdullah, vice president and founder of UCEL said.

Still in the final phases of gaining approval by the Student Programming Council, Al-Abdullah made clear that this club isn't just another place to make new friends.

"We market ourselves as a highly exclusive society of entrepreneurs," Al-Abdullah said.

The club meets several times a semester in workshops that include discussions ranging from the current job market to how to properly write a resume. The club also plans to host several guest speakers each semester. 

Planned speakers for the premier event of the club, planned for Nov. 5, include Jill Little, director of Human Resources for Sony Ericsson and Jose Gonzalez, vice president of the Flagler Development Group. 

Hopeful future speakers include Sony Ericsson's CEO and the president of the Flagler Development Group.

"We have ties to many Fortune 500 companies through personal relationships of our own," UCEL President and Founder H. Anthony Concepcion explains. 

Conception also thinks there is a possibility that many other prestigious businessmen will visit with the club along with many prominent local entrepreneurs coming in the future.

At least one event will be opened to the general public each semester, according to Concepcion, with most of the other events held exclusively for UCEL members. Future events the club has in the works include a golf tournament with many of the aforementioned entrepreneurs participating, playing golf with aspiring business people and members of UCEL.

"It is a great opportunity for networking in the business world." Concepcion said.

Many of FIU's students are commuter students who only go to school and return home, says Al-Abdullah, who wants to change that.

The club's first event will be Student Government Association's "Marketing Yourself" forum co-sponsored by UCEL which will be held on Nov. 5 in the Graham Center, room 243. Though the club will only be co-sponsoring the event, UCEL is planning to take over sponsorship of all its future events.

"FIU is an up and coming school itself. UCEL is going to build the reputation of FIU. It'll open students' eyes to what's available in the business world," Al-Abdullah said.

For more information, contact Concepcion by phone at 305-342-1472, or email him at haconcepcion@gmail.com, or contact Al-Abdullah at 305-794-8579, or by email at a_abdullah24@yahoo.com.

Headline: Biologist studies algae effects
Author: Luis Valdez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Kathleen Rein, a chemistry and biology professor, has been working in the field of marine toxins for over six years. 

She discovered that the National Institute of Health Sciences was looking for a minority institution to pair with the University of Miami to conduct research in her field of expertise. 

So Rein submitted a written proposal for the advanced research cooperation in environmental health, or ARCH, grant and was awarded the grant in 2001 for $2.5 million by the NIEHS.

As a result, FIU worked with the University of Miami and their Freshwater Biomedical Sciences Center to conduct the NIEHS research. 

The progress of the research led other institutions to fund an additional $4 million.

"About six to eight institutions received the grant in 2001, we were the only one that was renewed," Rein said. "We were really successful in our program."

Due to the success of those initial research projects Rein was once again awarded the ARCH grant, this time double in size at $5 million. 

Rein said that the grant would be used to research two areas.

The first one being the study of naturally-occurring algae such as "red tide," a type of algal bloom commonly found in the Gulf of Mexico. 

For example, researchers will study how the human body processes the algae when exposed to it. 

Many people are exposed to potentially dangerous algae during recreation or through drinking water.

 Marine and fresh water algae will be the focus of the research. 

"In Florida especially, these organisms flourish in our subtropical climate. As our population grows, we will turn more to surface water, which can have many risky organisms," Rein said.

This area of research will be hosted in the Toxic Algae Culture Core located in Owa Ehan, room 316, which is a major repository and supplier for a large number of investigators and chemical companies of microorganism cultures, DNA and RNA, antibodies and various toxins. 	

The facility also provides a variety of services related to the research of marine toxins and access to a wide range of equipment and training.

The second area of research will be the analysis of trace metals such as mercury, which is made in industrial plants and introduced into the environment though pollution. 

"We study the fate, transport and toxicity of environmentally and biomedically important trace metals," said Yong Cai, associate professor for the chemistry department and one of the main researchers studying the trace metals. "

We also look at how these trace metals react with human cells."

The second core facility, Trace Metal Facility Core, located in the Chemistry and Physics building, room 373, is currently undergoing renovations. 

FIU and UM ARCH researchers will use the site and other collaborators to study the trace of metals in tenvironmental and biological systems.

The grant will also give students and faculty the chance to work at IBM International Research Labs and the supercomputing center in Barcelona, to create a Global Living Laboratory for Cyber-Infrastructure Application Enablement

The grant will also offer more opportunities to minority students at FIU.

A recent national survey by the Computing Research Association showed that only 158 students out of 12,500 were Hispanics, with 26 of those students attending FIU.





FIU scores high marks in Princeton Review

The FIU College of Business has made history, being included for the first time in the "The Best 290 Business Schools for 2008" by the Princeton Review.

The College of Business placed fourth in the review's Top 10 ranking for Greatest Opportunity for Minority Students.

FIU's College of Law held its own, being included for the second year in the Review's "Best 170 Law Schools."

The College of law ranked second and fourth, for the diversity of its faculty and for the best environment for minorities, respectively.

Rankings were decided over three years through surveys from students and faculty members.

Headline: Volley Ball: Rude Aawakening: Losing streak reaches four games as Golden Panthers fall at home
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After an 11-2 start, everybody in the Golden Panther camp looked forward to the season ending in championship glory. Just one week later, that vision has been distorted a bit and prominence seems further away than anyone imagined. 

With all eyes on them in Pharmed Arena, the women's volleyball team stumbled Oct. 12 and 13 in matches against the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers and the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders - the two teams FIU split the conference title with last season.

Engulfed in a four-game slide, All-American power hitter Yarimar Rosa is frustrated by inconsistency and anxious for her team to get back on the right track.

"I am really disappointed because we can get better," said Rosa. "We are still going up and down and up and down and I think we can do better. I don't know what is going on that has us still in the same path... We really want to stop this rally of losing so we will fight."

 

WK 3, FIU 1



The Hilltopper trio of Jenna Gideon, Brittany Bowen and junior All-American Megan Arabright was simply unstoppable en route to a 3-1 (30-26, 23-30, 30-26, 30-24) win on Oct. 12. 

After dropping the first set, the Golden Panthers responded by hitting at a match-best .400 clip in the second game, forcing nine Hilltopper attack errors in the process. 

Unfortunately, that success was short-lived. 

The Golden Panthers committed a dismal 18 service errors and their defense fell apart down the stretch when it mattered most. 

"Western played well, but we made so many unforced errors that we could not compete with such a good team," said Tomic. "We were not disciplined in what we were doing at all. I told the team that the team that makes the least unforced errors will win and that is exactly what happed."

Excluding the second set, where seniors Anita Szymanska and Mina Spasojevic combined for nine kills, Rosa was the only constant for the Golden Panthers. She opened the game notching seven kills and four digs. 

That passionate play continued until the very end as she compiled a match-best 21 kills and 12 digs. 

Sophomore Olga Vergun was the only other Golden Panther in double-figure kills with 17, while Spasojevic finished with eight in the loss. 

Gideon led a balanced attack for the Hill toppers with 15 kills as Arabright and Bowen pounded 13 each. 

After the game, Golden Panther coach Danijela Tomic gave Arabright and the Hill toppers credit. 

"Defensively we couldn't stop their middles," she said. "We knew that their middles were the go-to players and we prepared for that. They have an All-American on the other side, and it is a reason why she is All-American." 



MT 3, FIU 0



A date with Middle Tennessee Oct. 13 only added to a weekend of anguish for the Golden Panthers. The Blue Raiders looked every bit like the defending Sun Belt Conference champions as they cruised to an easy 3-0 (30-16, 30-24, 30-19) win. 

This time around, Rosa was the only Golden Panther in double-digit kills with 15. MTSU Freshman Izabela Kozon had a match high 16 kills, while All-American power hitter Ashley Adams complimented her with 14 kills in the win. 

Tomic said the same factor that led to her team's downfall over the weekend has been haunting them all season. 

"We have to find a way to play more consistent," she said. "That has been my concern since the beginning of the season, that we cannot keep the focus. As a coaching staff we have to figure out how to make them play more consistent throughout the match. I just want us to compete. We always teach compete to the last point. I never want us to give up. I want us to leave everything that we have on the court." 

The Golden Panthers will look to be more consistent and get back on the winning track this Oct. 19 against Arkansas State at Pharmed Arena.

Headline: Commentary: Men's soccer team turns around season at perfect time
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The men's soccer season is alive.

The once flatlining team has won its last two games following a ten-game winless drought.

After totaling six goals in its first ten games, the rejuvenated offense, led by junior Juan Guerra and freshman Steven Cabas, scored five goals in its last two wins.

Cabas scored two goals against Central Florida and Guerra notched two versus the University of Alabama Birmingham.

When the Golden Panthers were struggling, their first victory was becoming an unattainable dream. Now that the dream was realized, all other obstacles are easier to overcome.

They knocked down their first obstacle on the road against UAB, overcoming a 1-0 deficit with eight minutes left in regulations to force overtime and then win in the second overtime.

These last two victories improved the Golden Panthers' record to 2-8-2 on the season and, most importantly, their Conference-USA record to an even 2-2-0. The way FIU won those two games indicates the team is determined to salvage the season.

Down with eight minutes left, the Golden Panthers team that played during the first ten games would've never been able to tie the game. This new team was reluctant to return to its losing ways. 

The team then refused to make its first win a meaningless aberration. It wanted to make it a habit and use it as fuel for the rest of the season against the rest of its conference foes. 

The Golden Panthers also needed to win for their first year coach, Munga Eketebi. The pressure was mounting on his shoulders as the replacement for Karl Kremser, who led the program for over 20 years.

Eketebi is one of the most mild-mannered coaches I have ever seen. He doesn't scream at his players or make rough gestures during games. He just expects his players to do their job. But the first ten games of the season even had him on edge. He must have felt that his team lacked a sense of urgency.

If there was a moment in which the Golden Panthers were going to break through, it was going to be against UCF. They had just dropped their first two consecutive conference games against Marshall and South Carolina, respectively. UCF was a weak conference opponent who was also struggling, entering the game with a four-game losing streak. If FIU would've lost against another struggling conference team, it would've ended the season - not just in the standings, but in future as well. 

During a losing season, there is usually something positive to build on for next season. If FIU loses to UCF, then it probably loses the remainder of its games and lose all chances of playing in the Conference-USA Tournament.

The next obstacle for the Golden Panthers is playing against  No. 10 ranked Southern Methodist University, who has a 7-2-1 record - the strongest opponent FIU will face this season. Beating SMU will prove that the Golden Panthers have learned and progressed as a team this season.

Every contest from her on out is the most important game of the season for FIU. The team will depend on Guerra to provide offense and goalkeeper Kyle Thomas to deflect shots on goal for the rest of the season against the remaining conference opponents.

Competing well in the Conference-USA Tournament will erase the dying first half of the season and keep fans optimistic for next season.

Headline: Football Notebook: Team comes off bye week against potent running game
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The 0-6 football team will take on the University of Louisiana-Monroe Warhawks (1-5) Oct. 20 at Malone Stadium in Monroe, La. The Golden Panthers are coming off their first bye week of the season and will be looking to get their first win of the season.

In three home games at the Orange Bowl this season FIU has given up 83 points and scored 32. However, on the road, FIU has given up 161 points and only scored nine in its first three away games. The nine points FIU has managed to score have all been on special teams plays. 

FIU will be coming in off its first bye week this season, giving the team extra time to prepare for Louisiana-Monroe.

"Having the bye week we have an extra week to watch film, so number one we work on improving yourselves and certain techniques and whatnot," said coach Mario Cristobal. "But we also add or sprinkle their defense and offensive schemes in our practice, so we can start getting used to seeing those looks."

Louisiana-Monroe has one of the strongest running games in the college football, averaging over 200 yards per game on the ground. Leading the ground game is senior running back Calvin Dawson, who ranks 10th in the nation with 735 rushing yards this season. Despite a its record, Louisiana-Monroe is a tough team that will be hard to beat, mostly because of the amount of yards it can gain on the ground. 

Against Troy FIU had its best offensive output of the season scoring two touchdowns and a field goal for a total of 16 points. Quarterback Wayne Younger passed for a career-high 248 yards to go along with 35 yards rushing for 283 total yards. Even if FIU did lose to Troy, Younger finally seemed to prove himself as a starter and quited any talks of a quarterback controversy. To get a win against Louisiana-Monroe, FIU will need to stop the run and make sure to continue improving its offense, which finally seemed to click against Troy.

This game will be the first of three consecutive road games. After that, FIU will play its final three games of the season at the Orange Bowl, including what could be the final football game ever played at the historic season in the season finale against North Texas Dec. 2.

Headline: Unbeatens stand alone at top of rankings: Few undefeated teams remain in college football
Author: Andrew Bagnato / AP Wire
&nbsp;
Kansas, Hawaii, Arizona State.

Ohio State, Boston College, South Florida.

Sounds like the field at the Maui Invitational. They are, in reality, the remaining unbeatens in major college football. 

It's mid-October, and six of 119 teams have navigated their way to a perfect record in this stormiest of college football seasons. They're a combined 40-0.

But it's too early for any of those teams to book their flights to the National Championship game.

We expect perfection from the top-ranked Buckeyes, who have become a monotonous victory machine under Jim Tressel, notwithstanding their embarrassing loss to Florida in the Bowl Championship Series title game last January.

That's twice-beaten Florida this season, by the way.

But what do the six unbeatens have in common, aside from unbeaten records?

Time zones ... no.

Tradition ... no. South Florida moved to college football's top level in 2001.

Rankings ... no. They range from No. 1 (Ohio State) to No. 17 (Hawaii).

"They've all traveled different paths," Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese said this week from Connecticut, where he was making a campus visit.

Chalk their records up to a combination of talent, coaching, parity and forgiving schedules. Or maybe "forgiving" is too kind.

The NCAA ranks schedules in a variety of ways, but the most telling is based on a team's previous opponents. By that measure, South Florida's schedule ranks 12th.

Among the other unbeatens, the next-toughest schedule belongs to Ohio State at No. 72. Arizona State ranks 84th, Boston College 92nd, Kansas 100th.

Hawaii has played the easiest schedule so far, according to the NCAA, and the Warriors had to go into overtime to beat Louisiana Tech and San Jose State.

No. 2 South Florida can hang its hat on wins over Auburn (on the Plains) and West Virginia. The other five don't have a suitable-for-framing victory among them.

The Buckeyes may or may not win the national title. After whipping Youngstown State, Akron and Kent State, they're a lock for state honors.

But we shouldn't mock perfection. Salute these half-dozen teams for what they've achieved so far - bowl eligibility, or close to it.

Tressel knows how hard it is to go unbeaten across a season. His 2002 team went 14-0, surviving numerous scares on its way to the Fiesta Bowl, where it had still more scares before defeating Miami for the national title.

"It's extremely hard," Tressel said on the Oct. 16 Big Ten coaches teleconference. "It doesn't happen very often. Sometimes the ball bounces your way and sometimes it doesn't."

Sometimes the official calls pass interference in the end zone, and sometimes he doesn't. That one went the Buckeyes' way in the Fiesta.

"To go through with winning all your games obviously is the most difficult thing there is," Tressel said.

In this loony autumn, just winning is difficult. Every team in The Associated Press preseason Top 10 has lost. (Ohio State opened at No. 11).

So congratulations to the Buckeyes, Jayhawks, Sun Devils, Eagles, Bulls and Warriors. And take a good look at them now, because their ranks may thin in the next few weeks. Five of the unbeatens are about to face rugged road tests. 

Only Hawaii gets a hall pass - and the way Colt Brennan has been going lately, it might be intercepted.

South Florida visits Rutgers on Oct. 18.

On Oct. 20, Kansas plays at Colorado, where Oklahoma went down a few weeks ago. Boston College goes to Blacksburg to take on No. 11 Virginia Tech on Oct. 25. Ohio State visits Penn State on Oct. 27. 

And if that's not hard enough, the Buckeyes take on resurgent Michigan in Ann Arbor on Nov. 17. Arizona State plays at No. 7 Oregon on Nov. 3. One look at that list makes you wonder if anyone can go unbeaten.

What if South Florida and Boston College are the only survivors? They're already No. 2 and No. 3 in the BCS standings, so they won't need much help to move up.

The Eagles, remember, fled the Big East to join the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Big East then plucked the Bulls away from Conference USA.

Tranghese chuckled at the suggestion that they might meet in New Orleans.

"Wouldn't that be something?" he said. "There's a long way to go."

Men's Soccer

	

On the strength of Sophomore Juan Guerra's two goals, the men's soccer team (2-8-2, 2-2-0 Conference-USA) took its second straight victory of the season in a 2-1, double overtime thriller over conference rivals Alabama-Birmingham (5-6-1, 0-3-0) Oct. 13 in Birmingham, Ala.

The Blazers took the lead on a mental mistake by the Golden Panthers, who allowed a header off a throw-in slip past the goalie in the 30th minute for a 1-0 UAB lead. 

The Blazers would hold the lead for the next 52 minutes as neither team managed any real scoring threats despite recording four shots a piece.

Then, as time was running out, Guerra slipped past a defender and fired a shot into the bottom left corner of the goal to tie the game with eight minutes left in regulation. 

In overtime, the Golden Panthers out shot the Blazers 6-0 but the tie remained until the last minute of overtime when Guerra again took command of the ball and took a shot that deflected off of the opposing goalkeeper's hands and into the net for his second goal of the match.

Guerra's two goals tied him for most by a single player in a game this season. Guerra also scored two goals against Illinois-Chicago earlier this. Also, freshman forward Steven Jair Cabas scored two against the University of Central Florida. 

His performance earned him Conference-USA Offensive Player of the Week honors and the win moved the Golden Panthers into second place in the conference. 



Women's swimming



Beginning just it's fifth season of NCAA competition, the FIU swimming team took on its cross-town rivals, the University of Miami, Oct. 12 at Coral Gables Norman Whitten Student Union Pool.

Despite strong performances from returning leaders junior Sara Giovannoni, senior diver Lindsay Lowell and co-captain Meredith Tisch, the team dropped 9-of-12 events during the meet and fell to 0-1 on the season. 

The Golden Panthers' next meet will be on Oct. 20 at 11:00 am at Tamiami Park.
