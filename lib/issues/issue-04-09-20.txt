&nbsp;
FIU is down by six points with nine seconds to go against the University of Miami. The Hurricanes are ready to punt the ball to FIU with Greg Moss ready to set the return.

The punt is up, Moss dodges one defender, a second, passes the five yard line and dives into the end zone-FIU wins.

These are the type of things fans and players can do with EA Sports NCAA 2004, the best selling college football game in the country.

Golden Panther players Antwan Barnes and Moss are two of the biggest fans of the game.  Both enjoy playing it during their off time.

"It makes me laugh, I never imagined this," said Barnes on being able to use himself in the game.

For Moss, being in the game has always been a dream of his.

"I've always wanted to be in a video game since I was a kid," said Moss as he scored a touchdown on Barnes in the game. 

On this day, Barnes used the FAU owls to take on Smith who went with his heart and picked the blue and gold.

As Barnes drove the Owls towards a touchdown drive he shouted, "It aint gonna happen in the real game though," Barnes said of the Nov. 20 match up.

Moss a cornerback and kick return specialist uses the game to place himself in positions he does not play on the field.

"I have always wanted to play receiver, so I sometimes put myself at receiver in the game," said Moss. 

After grueling practices and long hours of studying for school, Barnes uses the game to get away from the daily stress.

"It's relaxing. I play all the time when we have nothing to do," said Barnes.

Since the players found out that FIU was in the game, the players rushed to get it.

"Since they [teammates] found out, everyone went out and got it. Sometimes we all get together and play it on the big screen," said Moss referring to the giant TV located in the Towers.

The players can now use themselves in the game without having to create one another. In the past, players would use the create a player method mode to play have their name on a jersey in the game.. 

"Without making yourself is even better," said Barnes, who has one of the highest ratings of any player on the FIU team. "It's all about fun with the video game."

The video game features the entire FIU roster including "The Cage", FIU's football stadium.

Headline: Football ready for Western Kentucky
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
After accomplishing the first victory on the road and first of this season, the Golden Panthers are ready to play its home opener against Western Kentucky this Saturday, Sept. 25.

FIU will face the team that defeated them 56-7 two years ago in the Golden Panthers' first season. 

Despite losing by 49 points, FIU is bringing a new team with a different attitude this year-not the rookies that played in 2002. 

"We are a lot older. That team two years ago is nowhere near where we are now. The improvement and age is there. We've got so much more talent and its going to be a new team," said safety John Haritan, who recorded 21 tackles last game against Youngstown.

Head Coach Don Strock will have his hands full on offense against a Western Kentucky defense that held down the Golden Panthers' offense to 72 yards of total offense including minus seven yards rushing. 

The Hilltoppers run a 3-4 defense that gave trouble to the offense.

"They run the 3-4, and we've played it before. We've been working on the 3-4, and we also worked on it during camp, because other teams use a bit of it too. It's a little bit of a different protection for us so we have had three or four days to work on it, and we'll be prepared," said Strock.

Despite the fact that backup quarterback David Tabor came off the bench last week to drive FIU to three touchdowns towards the victory, Josh Patrick will remain the starter. Patrick is ready to show fans and coaches what he is made of.

"I'm ready. Dave did a good job, but I just have to keep working harder and get better," said Patrick who had a solid year last season where he finished with 2,493 yards passing and 12 touchdowns.

Offensive players will have their hands full against the 3-4 defense. In 2002,  the offense had as many turnovers (five) as first downs (seven).

"A 3-4 defense is kind of tricky. They [opposing teams] have more reads, but we have been working on it at practice," said running back Rashod Smith.

Added Patrick, "It's a little bit different than the 4-3 because they have an extra linebacker that can shift around a lot and give us different looks." 

On defense, FIU players are expecting Western Kentucky to pound the ball on the ground the way they did two seasons ago. The Hilltoppers ran on FIU 65 times for 400 yards. To compare the rushing attempts to FIU, the Golden Panthers only ran 26 times, less than half of what Western Kentucky did.

Linebacker Antwan Barnes expects FIU to stop the Hilltoppers this time around.

"Two years ago against us, all they [WKU] did was run the ball. They think they will do it this year but we are going to try to bring the house to them," Barnes said.

Haritan knows that as a safety he won't get much action on the air and will need to watch out for the run more than other games.

"They are going to run, run, run and run some more. We are expecting a lot of options from them," Haritan said.

Cornerback James Knapp gives credit to Western Kentucky who is the defending NCAA Division I-AA National Champion.

"They are a hard running team who will run the ball hard very single time," said Knapp.

The game is scheduled to begin at 6p.m.  The first 3,000 fans attending will receive an FIU bucket hat. In addition to the hat, all fans will be treated to a free concert featuring Method Man, Redman and the All American Rejects.

Headline: Golden Panthers looking to equal last year's win total of two
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The come-from-behind overtime victory at Youngstown State got the road-win monkey off the Golden Panther's back. 

Next, the team looks to equal last year's win total against a tough Western Kentucky side in the belated Sept. 25 home opener. 

Thrown in for good measure (and to drive average attendance upward) is a free post-game concert featuring Method Man, Redman and the All-American Rejects.

The Hilltoppers visit FIU Stadium for the first time in just the second meeting between the two teams. The first did not fair well for the Golden Panthers. 

They left Bowling Green, KY with a hard 56-7 loss to the eventual national champs. Western Kentucky held the FIU offense to a negligible 65 total yards and the Golden Panthers' running game struggled to negative seven yards on that day.

The past, however, is just that. The bye week that the team had last week, gave Coach Don Strock some additional time to prepare his team for the upcoming match-up. 

Bye weeks mean extra time to game-plan and work on fundamentals, key ingredients to playing mistake-free football. Western Kentucky will serve as a progress report on how much has changed since the inaugural year, and will show, win or lose, what this team's made.

Offensive Improvement 

At first, it may sound odd to call for improvement out of an offense that put up 461 yards and three touchdowns in its season opener. 

Nevertheless, as impressive as the come-back win was, the Golden Panthers produced a mere three points before quarterback David Tabor came into the game for Josh Padrick, down 13-3 in the fourth quarter. 

FIU will find overcoming a fourth quarter deficit much more difficult against Western Kentucky, should it find itself in that position.

 The key will be making the Hilltoppers' defense respect the run so that the passing game can be effective. Rashod Smith fumbled twice in his return from injury, giving up great field position and eventually points on both instances. 

The running game doesn't have to be spectacular, but it must protect the football, and it needs to be successful enough to take pressure away from Padrick. 

Western Kentucky features four lettermen line-backers in its 3-4 defense, all with decent size and experience. 

The unit registered a combined 293 tackles last season, including 110 by senior inside linebacker Charles Thompson and 83 from outside linebacker Brandon Smith, who tallied 17 for loss yardage with  sacks. 

FIU will count on its passing game as its biggest weapon, but this means the offensive line will have to give Padrick at least as much time to throw the ball as he had against Youngstown State. Wide receivers Harold Leath, Cory McKinney, Chandler Williams and tight end Sam Smith all possess good hands and the ability to get open if Padrick has sufficient time to throw. 

Padrick will have to be more accurate than he was in the season opener. He struggled against YSU but should rebound if the run-game can take some pressure off his arm. 

WKU Test for Tiger Clark's Defense

The FIU defense played well in Youngstown, OH. They battled with a short field throughout most of the game and forced the Penguins to settle for field goals. 

Yet, run-stopping remains a concern. FIU gave up 173 yards on the ground while allowing Monquantae Gibson 5.5 yards per carry.  

This week they'll have to contain running back Lerron Moore, who averaged over a hundred yards per game last season en route to 1,490 yards for the season. 

The Golden Panthers will also need to take advantage of opportunities. 

The FIU defense dropped several interceptions in the previous game and those opportunities need to be converted into turn-overs against a team like Western Kentucky. 

This could be a big win for either team. FIU has a chance to prove that the program is progressing. 

The game will rest on the performance of the defense and the extent to which FIU is able to run the ball. The post-game concert shouldn't be half bad either.

Headline: Women win home opener
Author: Ana Sanchez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After starting the season with a losing record of one win and four losses on the road, the Golden Panthers bounced back and picked up a victory in the season home opener. 

FIU defeated the University of South Florida 2-1 this past Thursday Sept. 16 in front of over 150 fans at the Soccer Stadium. The game was a make up for the game cancelled that was set for Sept. 12.

Coach Everton Edwards was pleased with the efforts of the team during the first half where FIU scored its two goals. 

"First half we played pretty well. We jumped on top of them which showed character because we had not done that for a long time," said Edwards.

The Golden Panthers dominated the first half with defender Kristen Hurst knocking in the first goal of the game and the first goal of her college career at minute 5.34. The goal was special for Hurst who scored  unassisted.

"It was very important, because we really needed this win. We want to show everyone that we were here to win, and it sets a good tone for everyone else," commented Hurst on goal. 

Then she added, "Being a freshman it feels great. It added enthusiasm to the whole crowd. I feel that we are bringing women's soccer back."

Six minutes later Midfielder Janessa Taddei kicked in an unassisted goal to give FIU a 2-0 lead. The goal was the fifth of the season for Taddei.

During the second half Kristen Danielik scored USF's only goal of the game. 

Goalkeeper Madeline Gannon made five saves during the game. During the second half as the FIU defense was being pressured constantly, Edwards shouted for the FIU defenders to advance the ball. 

"The ball rarely left the FIU defensive side. We dogged the ball on the second half," said Edwards.

Gannon kept a close eye on the ball as the Bulls put pressure on the Golden Panthers.

"Focus on the ball," Gannon exclaimed she kept saying to herself throughout the game.

Despite the pressure, Gannon felt comfortable out in the field.

"It wasn't too bad, I didn't have to dive a whole lot, and the victory felt great. The win was good. It was a little dirty, but it's a win and we'll take it," Gannon said.

Despite being outplayed in the second half and unable to put the game away, Edwards was content with the victory of the Golden Panthers. 

"We wanted to make one more goal. If we would have made another goal we would have assured the win; however, we led them back into it. But you know what? I'll take it."

Subheadline: Lack of concern for student comfort irks many
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
I think we all have experienced a crowded class without air conditioning. 

As a Political Science student one would expect the room temperature to rise from a debate or a discussion, but certainly not from an AC failure.

Failures like accidents are unplanned, but a willing and conscious AC shut down after 5pm of PC244 and its surroundings is unacceptable!

I've heard, both from faculty and students alike, that there is a direct relation between complaining and addressing an issue here at FIU. 

In other words, the more one complains, the more it takes for a matter to be solved.

Is this also a willing and conscious administrative procedure or the workings of Smith's "invisible hand?" 

Whatever the case, may one suggest the Administration to try a Constitutional Law Powers Class (POS3603 at PC244 5 p.m.- 6:15 p.m.) at a room temperature of over 85 farehnheit.

You'll feel your brain burning and it certainly is not due to the mental but the physical strain.

Oh, now I get it. 

In an effort to maximize its resources, the Administration is combining both physical education and Constitutional Law at the same time - keep up the good work!

Headline: 'Soft' system proves weak, tired, but mostly hellish
Author: John Collagrande Jr. / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Panthersoft is soft. 

There, I said it. 

Panthersoft is soft.

This has been one of the strangest starts to a semester, with the hurricanes and all, but the new student information system FIU implemented only contributes to the bizarre beginning. 

Note: the term soft here is not to mean plush-like, overmature, pliable, smooth, comfortable, subdued, sentimental, lenient, or delicate. Soft means weak. It's slang. "Yo, that sh*t's soft." 

This is the new student information system at FIU: weak. 

Can I possibly be the only one who encountered problems with Panthersoft? 

Impossible. Almost every person I spoke to hit stress with the system.    	   

Whether problems with passwords or an inability to find the courses we offer-the Panthersoft system made the registration process hell. 

Why was it such a mission to find the classes offered? 

Try finding a literature course if you're an English major. You need to know a million prefixes: ENG, LIT, LIN, AML, ENL. 

The whole thing is ASS, BAC, KWA, RDS.  

Classes offered in the same major should be in the same place!

The biggest mistake FIU made was completely getting rid of the paper trail. 

Not having at least a schedule in booklet form probably cost our school more money in lost tuition than we saved in printing costs. 

Miami-Dade College mailed me a paper schedule of the classes they offer. It was so easy. I didn't even ask for it. I'm not enrolled there. And it sucks because I don't want to hate on FIU. 

Why don't we have a paper schedule available if it is so hard to find the course schedule?

And don't say it's just me, 'kay? I'm a graduate student with a 3.9 GPA-I might be dumb but I'm not stupid-I can only wonder what a freshman or transfer went through. 	    It was never this complicated to register.

There are some good things about Panthersoft, direct deposit for financial aid, the ability to pay fines and tuition online, but do we need a personal portfolio to store telephone numbers? 

Maybe Panthersoft just takes time getting used to. Or maybe it is not as good as it should be.

Some of the blame could fall on whoever sold us the student information system. 

There are companies, like Oracle, that sell universities SIS software (student information systems, i.e. sis.fiu.edu). 

It may appear we have the most modern system available, when in fact, companies, like Oracle, hold back technology so they can make more money in the future by selling us upgrades. That's how tech companies make their loot. 

Meanwhile, the students wake up in the morning with full classes and sore asses. 

My neighbor, a transferring junior from The University of Georgia, has to sit out the semester because he couldn't get his passwords together in time for registration. 

The new system didn't have his information stored. By the time it was in order all of his classes were filled. 

Again, I love FIU, our school represents in so many ways; I feel uncomfortable hating on our school, but the Panthersoft debacle makes me wonder if FIU really does stand for F*ck It Up.

Yeah, I said it. So what! I'm pissed.

I want to feel like my school's got my back. I want to feel the love. 

You want me to come out and support the football team? Well, take care of me and I'll take care of you. 

We'll see if it's easier to register for class next semester. 

How hard can it be to fix? Hopefully, not too hard; after all, the system is named Panthersoft.

Headline: Kerry accuses Bush of hiding facts
Author: James Kuhnhenn / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Sen. John Kerry accused President Bush on Thursday of misleading U.S. troops and the country about the war in Iraq and said Bush was "in a fantasy world of spin" while Iraq was consumed by chaos.

Speaking to the National Guard Convention only two days after Bush appeared before the group, Kerry cited a bleak assessment of Iraq by U.S. intelligence agencies as evidence that the president has withheld unfavorable information about the war.

"I believe he failed the fundamental test of leadership-he failed to tell you the truth," Kerry said, in what aides described as an effort to step up his criticism of Bush's policy in Iraq. "You deserve better. The commander in chief must level with the troops and the nation. I intend to do that, on the good days and the bad days."

The intelligence appraisal, written in July and first reported Thursday by The New York Times, paints a grim picture of Iraq and says the best scenario is for continued uncertainty in terms of governance and security. The report, known as a National Intelligence Estimate, says the worst case would be the outbreak of civil war.

Kerry's speech came amid growing wariness on Capitol Hill about the direction of the war in Iraq and after Pentagon concessions that major cities in Iraq are under the control of insurgent forces. It was delivered the same day that two Americans and a British citizen were kidnapped in Baghdad.

"I believe you deserve a president who isn't going to gild that truth or gild our national security with politics, who is not going to ignore his own intelligence ... who will give the American people the truth, not a fantasy world of spin, but a world where we challenge our brave men and women to be able to meet the test of our times," Kerry said.

Though the 30-minute speech was one of Kerry's toughest critiques of Bush's Iraq policy, the Massachusetts senator offered no new ideas about how he would stabilize Iraq. As he's said before, he argued that he'd be best equipped to seek assistance from foreign allies to reduce the burden on money and manpower that the war has placed on the United States.

For the second day in a row, Kerry spoke to a polite but hardly enthusiastic audience. The president, during his appearance, was interrupted 32 times by applause; Kerry 11 times. There was no applause during a 14-minute stretch devoted to criticism of Bush.

 On Wednesday, Kerry addressed an audience of largely conservative businessmen at the Detroit Economic Club.

Speaking in Minnesota, the president ridiculed Kerry, saying his challenger's views on Iraq are always changing.

"Now, during the course of this campaign, the fellow I'm running against has probably had about eight positions on Iraq," Bush said. "For the war, but wouldn't provide the funding; then he was the antiwar candidate; then he said, knowing everything we know today; then he said, well, we're spending too much money-that's after he said we weren't spending enough money."

Vice President Dick Cheney also accused Kerry of shifting his views on the war for political reasons.

"Senator Kerry said today he would always be straight with the American people on the good days and the bad days. In Senator Kerry's case, that means when the headlines are good he's for the war, and when his poll numbers are bad, he's against it," Cheney said in remarks prepared for delivery in Reno, Nev.

The back and forth came as some national polls showed the race tightening.

A Pew Research Center poll found the race to be in a statistical dead heat, but said Kerry had lost the confidence of some voters that he could win the election.

The poll found that opinions on the president's handling of Iraq had improved since early summer, but that 58 percent of voters said it still wasn't clear what Bush would do about Iraq.

On Capitol Hill, Republicans also were raising questions in committee hearings and in comments to reporters.

"The worst thing we can do is hold ourselves hostage to some grand illusion that we're winning," Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., told reporters. "Right now we're not winning, things are getting worse. Measure that by any measurement you want-more casualties, more deaths, oil pipeline sabotage-you pick the measurement standard and it's worse than where it was six months ago or 12 months ago. ... We may have to start looking at some shifts in policy, some more creative ways to do this."

&nbsp;
A mother, a worker, a friend-members of the Aramark Classic Fare Catering services at Biscayne Bay Campus didn't have to search too far to find the right words to describe Rhonda Mooney, catering supervisor for that campus' cafeteria for the last six months, who passed away on Sept. 9 of a double brain aneurysm.

On the night of Sept. 8, Mooney was rushed to Aventura Hospital after an unexpected attack left her weak and in pain.

According to Juan Merino, Aramark's BBC catering manager and longtime friend, Mooney first suffered a seizure waking up 15 minutes later and complaining of a splitting headache.

Once at the clinic, a CAT Scan revealed a severe cranial aneurysm. 

Nevertheless, before she could be transferred to Jacksonville Memorial Hospital's Neurology ICU, the 55-year-old suffered a second aneurysm. 

Emergency surgery was not able to save, her and she passed away the following morning at 9 a.m.

The abrupt death of their co-worker left the catering and BBC Food Court staff stunned, especially since Mooney had possessed no previous health problems.

Most of the employees at the BBC Food Court and Classic Fare Catering admit to having become good friends with her after working so closely together, all agreeing that her presence will be greatly missed.

"I worked with her, I spoke with her, and I danced with her. She was very vivacious," said Norma Joseph, supervisor of the Oasis food stand.

Many remember her for her strong work ethics.

"[She was] very conscientious, hard working. One of the best catering people I had working for me," said Paul Sparks, BBC Food Court Director.

Mooney was born in Chelsea, Oklahoma, but lived in Claremore, 31 miles northeast of Tulsa, before accepting the position of catering supervisor at BBC last April.

She is survived by her two sons, 22-year-old Tristan, engaged to be married in January, and 25-year-old Garrett, who will be leaving for Iraq in February with the United States Navy.

A funeral service was held in her memory at the Kovens Conference Center on Sept. 17.

Headline: CIA analyst's lecture critical of politicians
Author: Maria Fuentes / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, an outspoken critic of the "politicization" of U.S. intelligence in the Bush administration, will address "Intelligence and the War in Iraq" Monday, Sept. 20 at 3:30 p.m. in FIU's Graham Center. 



The lecture has been rescheduled from its original date of Sept. 13.



McGovern's 27-year career spanned seven administrations, from John F. Kennedy to George H. W. Bush. 



In the mid-1980s, McGovern conducted one-on-one daily briefings with the vice president, and the secretaries of State and Defense. 



He retired in 1990 and last year co-founded Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, an organization of more than 35 former intelligence professionals. 



The group has published 11 memorandums accusing the Bush administration of improperly using intelligence to justify the war in Iraq.



In addition, McGovern has published at least 20 opinion editorials over the past year and has made numerous TV, radio and lecture appearances throughout the United States and Europe addressing what he considers a key concern: the corruption of intelligence efforts by politicians.



"There really should be a yellow sign around the Langley Headquarters of CIA: 'Politicians may go no further.'" McGovern said recently. "If there is any key problem with intelligence over the past several years, it's politicization."



Last month, President Bush chose Republican U.S. Congressman Porter Goss as the next director of Central Intelligence, stirring up a heated debate. McGovern has been openly critical of the appointment calling it "the ultimate in politicization."



McGovern's lecture is sponsored by The Center for Transnational and Comparative Studies and the Florida Network for Global Studies. 



Dennis Jett, dean of the International Center at the University of Florida and co-director of FNGS, said that this lecture is, "an opportunity to hear an expert talk about his views of what the causes of these intelligence failures are and what reforms might correct these problems." 



Organizers say the lecture will address issues that are being widely discussed in the U.S. presidential election.



"Ray McGovern is known for having strong opinions," said Cristyn Casey, program coordinator for TCS. "The purpose of this lecture is to engage others in a dynamic dialogue regarding intelligence issues and the importance of these issues for the ongoing debates regarding national security." 



The lecture is open to the public and will take place at University Park's Graham Center in Room 150. For more information, call 305-348-6561.

Headline: Ivan floods and blows apart Gulf Coast
Author: Gary Fineout and Martin Merzer / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Twenty died and thousands begged for help. Countless buildings were crushed or damaged, many by a roaring swarm of tornadoes. 

The Gulf of Mexico swept away beachfront homes and invaded downtown Pensacola.

Hurricane Ivan slowly loosened its grip Thursday on the Gulf Coast, revealing a vista of sprawling destruction. The storm's core punched the coast in Alabama but delivered its worst blows to an already battered Florida.

Hundreds of homes in the Florida Panhandle were damaged by at least 12 tornadoes. Hundreds more were de-roofed by Ivan's powerful winds, and many others along the coast were swamped by its 10- to 16-foot storm surge, topped by thunderous waves.

Power was knocked out to 345,000 homes and businesses in eight Florida counties and more than 1 million in other states. Most people in Pensacola and the rest of hardest-hit Escambia County also were without water, telephones or even reliable sewer service.

"It's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life," said Escambia County Sheriff Ron McNesby. "It's not as bad as Andrew, but it's a bad hurricane."

Damage assessments were inhibited by the storm's slow retreat and blocked roads, but some insurance experts issued estimates of $3 billion to $10 billion.

A 30-foot section of a bridge along Interstate 10 in Florida crumbled and fell into Escambia Bay, delaying desperately needed aid. Said Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: "Sadly, I think there will be more loss of life."

He said 2,000 National Guard troops were en route to Pensacola, as were search and rescue teams.

"Help is on the way," Bush said.

Authorities said the storm killed at least 13 people in the Florida Panhandle, including four who died when a twister ripped into a mobile home park in Blountstown, 40 miles northeast of Panama City. The tornado lifted several trailers, driving them 40 yards across a field and smashing them into a stand of trees.

Florida authorities said six of the 13 died in or near Pensacola; at least two of them apparently drowned.Louisiana reported four hurricane-related deaths, Mississippi two and Georgia one.

Ivan's toll in the United States and the Caribbean stood at 90, and the storm's remnants cruised slowly over the Southeast, dropping as much as 20 inches of rain and arousing concern about deadly floods. Inland flooding is the largest cause of hurricane-related deaths.

"I hate to think about what's going to happen inland," said Max Mayfield, the director of the National Hurricane Center in West Miami-Dade County.

The situation in Alabama and farther west along the coast was considerably better than in Florida, but far from ideal.

A National Guard convoy of more than 50 trucks headed to Mobile, Ala., with water and gasoline. Downed pine trees blocked portions of I-65 between Montgomery and Mobile. Power was out through most of southern and central Alabama.

President Bush signed disaster declarations for Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, which opens the way for federal aid.

It was Florida's third hurricane in five weeks. Hurricane Charley struck Southwest Florida on Aug. 13, then Hurricane Frances struck the Atlantic Coast on Sept. 5. Together, they caused dozens of deaths and billions of dollars in damage.

Then came Ivan.

Forecasters said the hurricane's destructive eye ended its long, deadly voyage through the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall at 2:57 a.m. near Gulf Shores, Ala., as a major Category 3 storm with 130-mph wind.

That placed it 33 miles west of Pensacola and the rest of the Florida Panhandle, which took a terrible beating from the storm's most severe eastern quadrant.

In Pensacola and throughout Escambia County, police received hundreds of calls for help, mostly from people whose roofs had collapsed. All four hospitals in the county and five emergency shelters reported damage.

Authorities in and near Pensacola spent much of the day looking for more victims.

With a stretch of eastbound I-10 completely washed out and the westbound section damaged, relief convoys from Tallahassee had to navigate a debris-strewn 45-mile detour through the northern end of the county.

In Mobile, targeted by the hurricane's core, the worst of the storm arrived between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., sounding as though a jet plane hovered overhead. As the storm receded, Mobile residents reported many streets blocked by tree limbs and roofing material, but they said it appeared that the city had been spared the catastrophe they feared.

"We lost a few shingles, but everything else looks great," said David Dishon, 45, who lived in the coastal community of Coden, south of Mobile. 

"When I saw it jogging off to the east, I knew we were going to be on the good side of the storm."

Farther west in New Orleans, residents expressed even deeper relief.

About 38,000 customers were without power, but no major flooding was reported.

Headline: Resident Evil: Zombie plagues
Subheadline: Hollywood diseased by dry, formulaic action flick
Author: Auturo Sande / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Hollywood loves formulas. One of Hollywood's favorites formulas is the very-little-plot, violence-packed, heavy effects-laden action film. It gets presented to the audience, and we in turn decide whether to spend our money and our time watching it. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose. With "Resident Evil: Apocalypse," we all lose.

 The film is a by-the-numbers sequel to the successful "Resident Evil," which is based on the popular video game of the same name, where the objective is to fight hordes of the undead, created by the evil Umbrella Corporation. 

This time around the gates to The Hive, the underground facility below Raccoon City, and the place where the action took place in the first film, have been opened and a zombie plague has reached the city. 

As Raccoon City is sealed, a group of survivors try to make their way to safety. Along the way, they have to fight zombies, mutant dogs and the Umbrella's latest creation: an 8-foot indestructible creature known as the "Nemesis". They are joined by Alice (Milla Jovovich), who this time around is a cross between Robocop and the Terminator, thanks to the mutation that the Umbrella Corporation has given her without her consent. Her powers come in handy when dealing with all the zombies and other monstrosities the bad guys throw at her and her friends in order to test her brand new powers. This all leads to an unoriginal, strained climax and a flat ending that sets things up for more installments.

The film was helmed by first time director Alexander Witt, who served as second unit director in many films, mainly in charge of the stunt sequences. The problem with "Resident Evil: Apocalypset relies too much reliance on too many stunts while ignoring plot, character development and just plain logic. Worse, some of the stunts and action sequences are edited in a fast; chop-chop style, which makes it impossible to know just what is going on. Witt is working from a script by Paul W. Anderson who directed the first "Resident Evil." In the original, Anderson understood that suspense and terror needed to be key elements to these types of films, so he created a claustrophobic, horror-action film. Sadly, with the exception of the action, all those elements are missing in "Resident Evil: Apocalypse," along with wit, freshness and intelligence.

Headline: R.Kelly : The best of both worlds
Subheadline: Gospel-like music meets club scene on new album
Author: Earlyne Louis-Charles / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
R. Kelly, also known as the Pied Piper of R&B is one of the most controversial yet prolific and talented artists in the business. 

The Chicago native songwriter, producer and singer consistently takes part in some of the hottest projects in the urban entertainment business. 

Yet it seems as if he won't stop stepping (a dance craze that became popular in the South). 

With the release of his eighth album (and second two-disc album) "Happy People/U Saved Me," he is both stepping in the name of love and in the name of God.

 The "U Saved Me" album is mostly inspirational/gospel music that puts your spirit at ease with the peacefulness of prayer, while the "Happy People" album caters to the grown and sexy age group who love to step. It is better that he does it this way because catering to the young and sexy is what made him so controversial, but I promise I won't get into that. 

Though there is a line between the steppers music and sacred songs, this album is truly the "Best of Both Worlds" from the Pied Piper. 

Kelly has never been one to half step on any of his albums, and the soul man continues to shine in the limelight. 

Indeed, "this is music." As Kelly passionately says on the opening track of disc one, "Weatherman,"  "this is music designed to touch your soul and put your spirit at ease." 

Track number ten, "If I Could Make the World Dance" is so powerful. The track mentions how Marvin Gaye inspired him to write this song. 

He imagines making the world a better place through music. He pictures a land with no war, loving our brothers and respecting our sisters. 

He would like the people of the world to just give each other a chance so that they may love. There is nothing but magnificence in this song. 

On disc two, Kelly reaches out to the down and out, the young and old, the rich and poor, drug dealers, drunks and women in all aspects. The brilliance of  "U Saved Me" gives powerful scenarios, each with an inspirational message. 

Everyone has their view of the Pied Piper, but despite the negativity, Kelly manages to withstand the hate and make good music.

Headline: Precocious Miami designer shines at Fashion Week
Author: Kathryn Wexler / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
NEW YORK - He is Miami's favored couture son, a designer so precocious he was the youngest ever to battle the fashion giants at New York's Fashion Week when he first showed in 2002.

Last week marked Esteban Cortazar's third visit to the hallowed white tents in Bryant Park, where designers unveil their spring/summer 2005 collections, competing for the love of buyers, editors and celebrities.

Who could blame us for wanting 20-year-old Cortazar, who graduated from Miami's Design & Architecture High School this year, to trump them all?

And when Naomi Campbell, one of Cortazar's many celeb-friends, sashayed down the runway to "Let the Sunshine In," it was definitely a Fashion Week moment. In an unusual outburst, the crowd clapped wildly.

The problem with nabbing Naomi, however, is that she always makes a bigger impression than the clothes she wears. But if anyone happened to look down, she would have seen one of Cortazar's better pieces, a tight yellow suede and chiffon dress.

More yellow followed, in billowing blouses, a linen shirt dress and chiffon-tiered skirt. 

The yellow was warm and bold, but Cortazar sometimes paired it with ho-hum white shirts of the variety that spell, "Target," not "Barneys," leaving us to wonder: Esteban, what were you thinking?

Apparently, he wasn't thinking Miami, the adopted homeland of the Colombian-born prodigy.

"It's more about sunshine in general," said Cortazar, gracious and smiling despite the incessant demands of paparazzi clogging the dressing rooms backstage before the show. "Her walking in the sunshine, beautiful."

Sunny days, foaming surf, beautiful skies_we've heard it all before. But Cortazar is just out of his teens, and can be forgiven for sounding trite under pressure. 

Designers usually have a hard time effectively articulating inspiration for their collections, particularly when they're still learning. And Cortazar, as talented as he is, does have a way to go before his designs are memorable enough to emerge from the Fashion Week crush of clothes.

His handsome peach-toned numbers were some of his best, including a chiffon top with a sparkling, beaded knee-length skirt. And two floor-length gowns that hugged the body, bell-like at the hem with tulle, were head-turners as they bobbed down the runway.

He also played with a lovely floral motif in various accents, like red and blue, twisting them into skirts and dresses, one which crossed over the chest and dissolved into a fluttering blur at the knees, soft and girly.

And although Cortazar wasn't trying to evoke Miami, MAC chief makeup artist, Gordon Espinet, was. 

The models were made up to look sun-doused with wine-stained lips, he said.

"She has a tan, and she doesn't like to wear a lot of makeup," Espinet explained, dabbing brown goop onto a waif's pale face.

Naomi Campbell was listed in the program as being the grand finale, but for some reason, she didn't appear. Cortazar took his customary bow at the end, but not the typical brief hello of more seasoned designers. 

Instead, in a delightful display of enthusiasm, he walked the length of the runway, smiling at the dozens of well-wishers who gave him a standing ovation.

In an indigo button-down shirt, jeans and white flip-flops, Cortazar smiled broadly. 

He seemed to skip a little. And he waved with both hands.
