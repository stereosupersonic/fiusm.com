Subheadline: School of Medicine will benefit university
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
President Modesto A. Maidique gave his last arguments on the benefits of the medical school initiative in front of a skeptical Board of Governors on Nov. 17. 

The establishment of the medical school has been a controversial issue for the last decade, but many of the points raised by the president lead us to believe it is a positive addition to the university.

However, we disagree with one of the president's main points. In his speech, Maidique, focused heavily on the predicted national shortage of doctors, which he contends the school will help alleviate. This could have been more of a scare tactic being that other solutions may exist to solve this problem, specifically investing more funds to expand hospital residency programs. 

We believe the main benefits of the school will be the economic impact it will have on the South Florida community and overall reputation of the university. According to the president's proposal, it is projected to bring 11,249 jobs into the community and it will have an annual economic impact of $784 million.

Students might also be interested in knowing how the medical school initiative will affect their time at FIU even if they're not majoring in medicine. 

The fact of the matter is, especially for future students, that with a medical school at FIU, diplomas will mean a lot more and add prestige. 

Given by the large amount of donations ($67 million and counting) and the support of students (over 40 attended the meeting to show their support) the community is behind the effort.

Most of the nation's top universities have reached their status partly because of their success in attaining both a law school and a medical school. 

FIU has already seen such promising results in the law school, so there's no reason to believe it won't repeat the performance with a medical school. 

Some of the members of the faculty believe that the money being invested in the medical school should be used elsewhere such as programs already established in the university. What many should be aware of is that an unprecedented $67 million dollars have already been donated solely for the initiative. 

Since this money cannot be used if the school is not approved the opportunity to make use of the money should not be ignored.

A common complaint is that the university is attempting to accomplish too much at the same time (like trying to establish a medical program while maintaining a fledgling law school). Such steps must be taken in order to sustain the progress and growth of FIU. 

By sticking to these initiatives despite opposition we can assure that we are laying the foundation on which an important center of learning will be built.

Headline: Boondock's use of the n-word degrades everyone
Author: E.R. Shipp / New York Daily News
&nbsp;
I will never embrace the N-word.

That's why I have difficulty with the TV version of "The Boondocks" that just premiered on the Cartoon Network. As adapted from the in-your-face comic strip created by Aaron McGruder, the show uses the N-word quite vigorously. 

Maybe this is a generational thing. I'm old school. But, heck, old school means that I not only know how to speak English correctly but that I also know a bit about history. I have lived through times when white slingers of the N-word meant no endearment. 

I embrace another N-word for endearment and disparagement. It's "Negro." That was always a word that was a step up from the one that McGruder finds so comfortably trickling off his tongue. 

When I use the word Negro, you know where you stand with me by inflection and where my hands are on my hips.

I have often defended McGruder's comic strip, even when newspapers that carry it refuse to publish it because of its incendiary (they say) content - whether about Black Entertainment Television's lack of blackness or Whitney Houston's drug problems or the Bush administration post 9/11 or Condoleezza Rice's love life. The strip offers three facets of the angry black man, with two preteen boys, Huey and Riley, living with their grandfather in a mostly white suburb that is nothing like their former neighborhood in Chicago.

I'll keep an open mind about the television version. 

David Bianculli, the TV critic for the New York Daily News, is among those who liked its late-night debut. The show, as he sees it, "with all its knowingly controversial observations and language, is a sort of animated equivalent of 'All in the Family.' It'll make you think, and maybe even wince - but at the same time, it makes you smile."

Unless you're wincing so much because of that N-word. 

"I think it makes the show sincere," said McGruder in a recent online interview with Lee Bailey. "At a certain point, we all have to realize that sometimes we use bad language. And the N-word is used so commonly, by not only myself, but by a lot of people I know, that it feels fake to write around it and to avoid using it."

Back in the day, that is to say, when I was a college student in Georgia, I thought it rather cool to hear the radical group, The Last Poets, precursors to today's rappers, use music and the spoken word - even the N-word - to analyze, even sear, American society and values, and to pump up blacks with a sense of we-were-once-royalty-in-Africa. But I have evolved and have flushed that word from my historically sensitive brain.

McGruder claims that he has merely picked up the conversation begun in the days when the comedian and social critic Flip Wilson, in his own words, reserved the right to be a n-----. 

"This is a country that celebrates Richard Pryor as a genius," McGruder told The Associated Press, "and still we wonder if we should be using the word 'nigga' in entertainment. It's a conversation that hasn't gone anywhere in about 30 years."

Wilson is dead. Pryor is incapacitated, but when he was still vigorous and razor sharp, he renounced the use of the N-word after a life-changing pilgrimage to Africa.

Good luck with your TV show, Aaron, But if you remain true to your pledge to bombard us with the N-word, I don't think there is enough Botox in the world to keep me watching and wincing and still keeping it together. I'll tune out.

Call it my generational privilege.

Headline: New self-testing technology for HIV is no silver bullet
Author: Kai Wright / KRT Campus
&nbsp;
Soon, the Food and Drug Administration may approve a do-it-yourself HIV test, but that would be no great advance.

The test under review is the latest advancement in a technology that many who are working to stop HIV's spread hope will be their silver bullet. Such easy answers, however, are the stuff of myths in HIV.

Easier testing would offer advantages.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than a quarter of the one million Americans living with HIV have no idea they are infected, which makes them much more likely to unwittingly pass the virus on. 

As a result, the agency has worked tirelessly in recent years to spread its "Know Your Status" gospel: Get tested, the life you save might be your own.

The problem has been that getting tested can be a real pain. 

You have to trek down to a clinic or doctor's office, where you wait nervously to get poked repeatedly with needles while answering counselors' questions about your sex life and drug use, all to be told to return in a couple of weeks for the results. (The CDC estimates about a third of those who go through this each year never come back for the results.)

The agency was among the loudest cheerleaders when, in 2003, the FDA began approving "rapid testing" technology. With these tests, patients give just a small prick of blood or a swab of oral fluids and get results in as little as 20 minutes. 

Today, more and more doctors and clinics are using one of four rapid tests that have won approval.

CDC studies show that, over the long term, people who learn their status - whether positive or negative - are less likely to engage in "risky" behavior.

The over-the-counter test that the FDA's advisory panel is considering is one of those four, called OraQuick. 

If ultimately approved by the agency, would-be testers could drop into the nearest drugstore, pick one up and find out their status - no muss, no fuss. And, for the first time, there would be no requirement for a health-care provider to be present.

But having a health-care provider present is valuable. Learning you have an incurable, fatal illness is not akin to taking a home pregnancy test. 

To strip the testing process of all interaction with health-care providers may not only lessen its usefulness, it may do added harm.

As rapid-testing proponents have said, any new tool we can use to slow the spread of HIV is a welcomed one.

But we need to focus more attention on the things that fuel HIV's fire: Poverty, lack of health care, a prudish resistance to frankly discussing sexually transmitted diseases and wrongheaded policies on preventing infection from intravenous drug use.

Twenty-five years into the epidemic, we're still looking for quick fixes. Sadly, we're still not prepared to see HIV for what it is: A lasting problem that requires a prolonged, wide-ranging response.

Subheadline: Student disagrees with article on alcoholism
Author: Aioni Ortiz / Junion / International Relations/Public Relations
&nbsp;
I wholeheartedly agree that alcohol is not a necessity. However, I do not agree with your author's attempt at bringing this to light. Thanks to her redundancy on the matter, the article was handed about as a joke.

 Everyone read it and got his or her laughs. Yes, it did get a lot of people talking about it, but mostly they were discussing the hypocrisy so clearly exhibited by the author. She went on ad nauseum about how a good time could be had sober or with one or two drinks, then stated that even that wasn't safe and "some campus activities would never succeed without it." 

The absolute icing on the cake was the last paragraph that came completely out of left field and had no point whatsoever. 

But that's the whole problem; the article had no point, no argument, just opinions backed by more opinions. Maybe if some semblance of intelligence had been injected into this article it wouldn't have been the joke around GC yesterday. 

I'm an avid reader of The Beacon and I hate that drivel like this gets published.

Subheadline: Senior point guard takes on role as leader of Golden Panthers
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I guess you can say nothing fazes Faeza. Why? The senior guard has already adapted to an entirely different continent, learned to speak a different language and successfully replaced a solid player at point guard. Now, with leading-scorer Milena Tomova gone, there should be little doubt on Faeza Bouderra's ability to lead this team to the top.

"I know I'm the senior. I'm the captain and they're expecting a lot from me and I think the best way to do that is to just show that on the court and have the right attitude," Bouderra said.

But even for leaders as quiet as Bouderra, the climb from the bottom to the top is not a silent one. Their actions reverberate loudly through empty gymnasiums in the middle of suicide drills and depleted locker rooms after gut-wrenching losses.

"[Bouderra] is one of those girls that just gets a lot of respect from her players," said head coach Cindy Russo, "mainly because of her impeccable work ethic."

There's nothing more important for an emerging leader than respect from her teammates. Thanks to her outgoing personality and displayed poise for success, Bouderra has received much respect from her girls.

"Faeza is the captain of this team and we are really counting on her to step it up," said junior center Lasma Jekabsone.

And what a long road she traveled before those words became a reality. Just last season, Bouderra was in her third year at FIU and looking toward another season of backing starting point guard Deniz Boz.

Even though her dreams of starting were farfetched, her perception of the game and her will to succeed remain unchanged.

"All I want is to be someone you can look up to. I don't want to be a role model. I just want to be an example for my teammates," Bouderra said about her incomparable work ethic.

Due to a devastating injury to Boz, Bouderra finally got her shot and proved her worth all throughout the Sun Belt Conference in 2004-2005. By dishing out a league leading 5.7 assists, leading the team in minutes-per-game, tying the FIU record for free-throws made in a contest and hoisting a career-high 20 points versus Dayton, Bouderra set herself up for the role that confronts her today.

Bouderra will now play the part of the unprecedented leader with Boz and Tomova out of the picture. Not only will she lead by example, she will have to step up as a vocal leader as well - a role she says will fit her just fine.

"I'm being more of a vocal leader in practice now, too," Bouderra said. "It's nothing new to me because when I was back home in France, I used to be captain of my team."

As captain of the team, Bouderra  will  have to shoulder more responsibility than ever before. Coming off a disappointing one-point loss to Louisiana-Lafayette last season that gave FIU another year falling short of a Conference Championship appearance, time is running out for the senior out of Mulhouse, France. But the expectations are no lower.

"My first objective is to win the Conference. When I came here I always wanted a ring," Bouderra said.

The Golden Panthers will be more geared toward even distribution and up-tempo basketball without the dynamic scoring of Tomova. This will allow for an equal-opportunity offense and, ultimately, more freedom for Bouderra.

"Our main focus was on [Tomova] last year because she was the leading scorer, but I think this year we have more threats and it's going to give more of an opportunity for players to step up," Bouderra said.

Coach Cindy Russo will rely on her faithful point-guard to fill the holes and lead her team deep into the playoffs.

"She is going to have to step it up and bridge the gap," Russo said. "The more you hang around this game, the more confidence you gain, and she has been able to do that."

There can't be anything greater, in such a big year for Bouderra, than having the coach that has stuck with her all through her collegiate career by her side.

"She trusts me a lot and she expects a lot from me," Bouderra said. "I've improved a lot since I've come here in the way I play basketball and I think it has a lot to do with her."

Surely it does. But nothing is ever achieved without hard work and Bouderra is the staple of that for this program. Whether it is taking extra jump shots with coach Inge Nissen after practice or hitting the weight room the day after the conclusion of the season, Bouderra has been able to expand her game profusely to get to where she is right now.

"I know my biggest strength is my quickness and penetration," Bouderra said. "So [this offseason] I worked on my shot. I didn't shoot much last year. I'm not expecting to be the leading scorer and take all the shots for the team, but I know if there's one opportunity to shoot ... I should take the shot."

With the start of the regular season underway, the improvement is evident. 

"Faeza has just kept improving every season," Russo said. "Versatility is her game and she has expanded it [with her jump shot]."

All the work put in throughout an entire lifetime will come full circle during this 2005-2006 season. It will be the coming out party for the Faeza Bouderra that has been a "work-in-progress" throughout her life.  

All those nights in Pharmed Arena sitting on that bench, those summer afternoons humped over, drenched in sweat after five-dot drills and those gloomy locker room moments after yet another season-ending loss will accumulate into the final project Bouderra will display this season. But nothing fazes Faeza and she is more confident than anybody on her goals for the season.

"I'm not leaving [FIU] without a ring."

&nbsp;
Senior offensive lineman Ed Wenger, who was nominated for the Draddy Award earlier this year, was named one of 13 finalists, all of whom play in Division I-A football, for the Wuerffel Trophy. 

The award, named after Florida quarterback Danny Wuerffel, who won the Heisman Trophy and national championship in 1996, is a national award that honors a college football player who best combines exemplary community service with outstanding academic and athletic achievement. 

Being chosen for the award also includes a selection in the Academic All-District football team by ESPN the Magazine. 

A voting committee, comprised of 10 Wuerffel Trophy regional directors, will make it's selection later this month. The trophy will be presented to the winner in February at the All Sports Association's Award Banquet.  

Wenger joins players from the ACC (2), Big East (1), Big Ten (1), Big Twelve (2), Pac 10 (2) and SEC (3). Together with Brandon Hoyte of Notre Dame, they are the only two players not members of a BCS conference.

FIU's three-time Academic Excellence Award winner, Wenger has already graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. He currently holds a 4.0 GPA in graduate school and has been endorsed by the university as a Rhodes Scholar applicant. 

Wenger is also the co-founder of the Master Mentor Program, which provides one-on-one counseling and mentorship for high-risk and potentially high-risk student-athletes.

&nbsp;
The women's volleyball team saw its season come to an end the evening of Nov. 17 with a loss in straight sets to third-seeded Denver in the quarterfinals of the 2005 Aéropostale Sun Belt Conference Volleyball Championships in Murfreesboro, Tenn.

Head coach Danijela Tomic's team, who entered the tournament as the sixth seed, ended its season with a 15-13 record - a complete turnaround from last season's three-win team.

In their previous meeting this season, FIU also lost to Denver in straight sets.

Sophomore Anita Szymanska, Sun Belt Conference Newcomer of the Year, led FIU with 11 kills - marking her 24th match with double-digit kills - and four blocks. 

Sophomore Whitney Kenney added a double-double, recording 33 assists and 11 digs.

In game one, FIU fell behind early, 8-1, but showed signs of life, recording six consecutive points off the service of Freshman Mariana Drumeva. However, it wasn't enough as FIU could not tie the score, especially after a 12-3 run by Denver, and lost 30-20. 

Szymanska and senior Anna Dmowska each had four kills in the game.

The Golden Panthers battled profusely in game two, which featured 14 tie scores and three lead changes. 

FIU had late lead at 24-23, but it was Denver who put the game away, scoring five of the last six points for a 30-26 win. 

Szymanska and senior Laura Vogel led their team with four kills each in the game.

The Pioneers recorded the first five points of game three and never relinquished the lead in a 30-20 match-clinching victory. The closest FIU got to tie was at 5-3. 

Szymanska and Vogel each had three kills in the final game.

Headline: Bill filed to issue pink license plate to DUI convicted
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
Think twice about driving after that last margarita. A bill filed by Florida Senator Mike Fasano of New Port Richey (R) proposes that a bright pink license plate be issued to people with restricted driving privileges that resulted from being convicted of driving under the influence. 

The purpose of the pink license plate, according to Fasano, is so that drivers will think twice before drinking and driving. If the bill is passed, the first three letters on the license plate will be DUI, and in addition to that, the bill gives policemen the right to stop a pink license plate vehicle to check up on the driver without probable cause of them being intoxicated.

"Generally it is not grounds for a stop if police knows you have done something in the past, said Aya Gruber, crime law associate professor of the College of Law. The police make stops for one of two reasons: Traffic violation or other reasonable suspicion of a crime, for example, a driver with a pink license plate driving out of a bar would be grounds for a stop, [otherwise] it is unconstitutional." 

Ohio and Michigan have a similar law into effect. Once convicted of DUI in Ohio, the driver gets a yellow license plate with red letters, nicknamed the "Scarlet Letter Plates." In Michigan, if arrested for DUI and formerly convicted, the state issues the driver a paper tag. Other states including Tennessee have proposed DUI bills, but failed due to debates over privacy issues.

Out of 15 million licensed Florida drivers, approximately 840,000 have an active DUI sanction on their driving records.

While Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) encourages the bill, the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) opposes it. Fasano is willing to compromise the right to check up on drivers without probable cause if it proves to be unconstitutional. The bill was filed Nov. 1 and was vague in mentioning whether the state will issue the tag.

Headline: Politics may influence board's decision making ~ Editor in Chief's View
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
The answer FIU was waiting for did not come. Although the Board of Governors did not reject the university's proposal on Nov. 17 for a medical school, it decided to delay the response until March.

Both FIU President Modesto A. Maidique and University of Central Florida President John Hitt presented lengthy PowerPoint Slides in hopes of capturing the approval of the BOG.

With administrators, faculty and students in the room, a seemingly nervous Maidique presented in efforts of convincing a divided board.

Chair Carolyn Roberts stated that some members of the board needed more time and could not reach a conclusion. According to sources, the vote delay occurred in part due to three persons: J. Stanley Marshall, Sheila McDevitt and Zach Zachariah. 

Zachariah, one of the strongest opponents, lashed out at Maidique at a BOG meeting in July for just mentioning the medical school when it was not on the agenda. And during the Q and A sessions after FIU's and UCF's presentation, he was the first to question statistics shown by both universities and first to question if allocating money for the medical schools was a real necessity. 

He even went out to say that it didn't make any sense to build new schools but rather invest in old ones.

The problem with Zachariah's opposition is that his motives are questionable. Is his opposition genuine or an expression of the people he works for? After all, he serves on the Board of Trustees for Nova Southeastern University and volunteers as a clinical professor at the University of Miami School of Medicine.

His alliance with Nova and UM can be a conflict of interest. Both Nova and UM are private universities with medical programs; if FIU was awarded a medical school, the cost to go to FIU - a public state university - would be much less.

In essence, this can translate into the possibility of students bypassing the more expensive institutions for FIU.

Although Zachariah's main concern seemed to be the large amounts of money needed, Maidique proved that sources of investments would not be a problem. Maidique began his presentation with a bang when he announced that to date, $67 million have been raised on donations alone. 

Out of these gift funds, the biggest will come from Herbert Wertheim, a Board of Trustees member and longtime associate of the university. 

Announced on the day of the presentation, Wertheim has pledged $20 million cash if the BOG approves FIU's proposal.

The donation amount is significant. To donate $67 million with no product to account for is not only extraordinary but also rare. 

How many people do you know that will put up money for something that has yet to be built? And because the money comes from donations, the state matches the amount, totaling $134 million. 

Because it is so rare to receive such a high amount of money, Maidique joked late into the presentation that he was considering a career change to medical school fundraiser. 

Though the joke brought laughter from the crowd and seemed to somewhat calm the president, his efforts in bringing in such substantial donations to the initiative may prove his joke to be true.

Whether the delay of the vote will help or hurt FIU and UCF is not known. According to sources, if the vote would have taken place, the chances of receiving the approval were slim. But as the presentations by FIU and UCF were strong and well put together, the tables could have turned.

When asked whether the delay would hurt or benefit FIU, Interim Provost Donald Berkman was not sure.

"I don't know, after seeing the enthusiasm of the room and the energy today you kind of say, 'Well, we would have taken the vote today,' but they weren't ready to do it and it's a big decision," Berkman said after the presentations. "The presentations today will help us and the longer they have to think about it the more the support will grow."

With March four months away, FIU will have time to convince Zachariah and other dissenters. 

The donations already show that the community is behind the efforts. Let's hope the BOG makes the decisions for what is best for the state.

Headline: Board of Governors postpone decision until March 2006
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
JACKSONVILLE - An entourage comprised of administrators, students and members of the Student Government Association were told by the Board of Governors that it would not vote on FIU's medical school proposal.

"To vote for this decision that's so important to the state, we all need more time to be informed," said BOG Chair Carolyn Roberts barely 10 minutes into the conference, held Nov. 17 at the University of North Florida. 

She then assured those in attendance that a vote would definitely be taken in March.

However, this announcement did not come as a surprise to University President Modesto A. Maidique who had said he did not expect a vote.

According to Carlos Martini, director of the medical school initiative, one of the primary advocates for the delay in the vote was J. Stanley Marshall, a trustee of Florida State University and new board member.

"Dr. Marshall did not think he was prepared to cast a vote on an issue he thought he was not fully informed about. He voiced this concern to [Roberts] and everything followed after that," Martini said.

Administrators still prepared for the presentation, though, an event described by Maidique as "an important day for the university."

The president delivered a PowerPoint slideshow himself before a standing-room only audience in a University of North Florida conference hall.

Maidique included points made in past presentations: The predicted national shortage of doctors; troubles in recruiting foreign physicians; the under representation of minorities in the field and the medical school's potential boost to the local economy.

The president stressed that FIU will seek its own funds for the construction of needed facilities, a fact given added weight by Maidique's announcement that Board of Trustees member Herbert Wertheim's foundation will donate $20 million to the medical school effort.

This donation was predicated on the condition that the governors approve the initiative. Wertheim had also donated $10 million for this program in 2004. 

Maidique concluded his presentation with his personal views on the proposal process.

"Throughout my career, I have done many presentations and been involved with various initiatives, but I have never believed more in the strength of a proposal as I do in this one," he said.

Maidique was followed by University of Central Florida's President John Hitt, whose presentation points closely resembled FIU's. 

"It was imperative that the board approve both schools," Hitt said. "We've been working closely for the same goal and believe our joint effort will benefit the entire state." 

Although the UCF presentation went 30 minutes over the given time, the BOG still convened for a questions and answers period after a short break.

One of the first to speak was Zach Zachariah, a board member who has been the most vocal opponent of the medical school initiatives for the last few years.

"I have looked through the information and I still don't see a clear resolution for the supposed shortage problems," Zachariah said.

The foreign-trained doctor stated that a better solution would be to expand hospital residency programs within existing medical schools such as those in the University of Florida and the University of Miami. 

Although other board members raised objections, Zachariah remained the loudest voice of dissent throughout the rest of the meeting.

Although the location for the March meeting has not been announced, administrators state that they will keep lobbying up to that time, especially after FIU sources confirmed that the opposition within the board is greater than had previously been thought.

"I think we've done as best as we possibly could," said Interim Provost Ronald Berkman. "The longer they have to think about it, the more time we have to ask questions with them, the more the support will grow."

Headline: Public relations projects get students started
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Public Relations Student Society of America has returned in full-affect to the Biscayne Bay Campus and is looking to rebuild itself with a new group of motivated students excited about entering the field of public relations. 

The FIU chapter of PRSSA began in 1979. President Albert Bennett, who is majoring in public relations, said they are renovating themselves slowly and hopes to offer new opportunities for students interested in careers involving public relations and marketing.

"Former students of PRSSA have found work in a multitude of magazines, such as, On Living magazine and Ocean Drive," "Bennett said.

He said this chapter of PRSSA is "about creating your own opportunity before you get in the workplace so that you will have work to show your future employers."

Other opportunities were also offered to members as volunteers in case-studies where they had to come up with ideas for specific campaigns. 

This year's client is Habitat for Humanity and PRSSA is already considering large-scale ideas for the campaign, such as a group of students building a house to promote Habitat's charity service of houses for families in need. However, they are missing man-power.

In earlier years, students would attend the annual PRSSA conference but in the past years the conference has been cancelled due to hurricanes. 

The FIU chapter has won various prominent awards such as the PRSSA Southeast Region award for Best Community Service Project in 1995. Recently in 2000, the chapter was awarded FIU's Student Life Shining Star Award for outstanding community service and ongoing diversity awareness. They were also finalists at the Student Life Shining Star Awards in 2001 and 2002.

A great achievement for the club has been a yearly hurricane guide called The Get Ready Guide which PRSSA created for residents of South Florida following Hurricane Andrew in 1992 with tips on how to prepare for hurricane season. 

Unfortunately, it outgrew their capabilities due to the demand from 167 stations and 100,000 guides a year. 

According to the 2003 hurricane website, the FIU chapter of PRSSA integrated the Get Ready hurricane preparedness program into the Miami-Dade County Public School's science curriculum in 1996. 

"PR is in everything, there isn't a field in communications that doesn't involve some type of public relations work. Through our club students get a chance to work on projects, fundraisers, and gain experiences that they can put on their resumes when looking for jobs," he said. 

For more information about PRSSA, their general meetings are on the fourth Monday of each month at 7:45 p.m.

Headline: Enrollment causes mixed feelings on campus
Author: Bettina Lett / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Faculty and staff insist enrollment at the Biscayne Bay Campus has increased, but student observations and remarks show otherwise.

At the end of the Fall semester 2004, the overall enrollment for students based at BBC was at 7,516 enrolled and for the Fall semester in 2005 it was 7,378, according to  preliminary data gathered by the Office of Institutional Research, the primary collector and provider of data concerning the university in Oct. 2005.

Although there was a difference of about 200 students this year, administrators, like Vice Provost Raul Moncarz, take in to consideration the hundreds of students lost when the School of Nursing was moved to University Park at the end of the 2004.

"When the [School of Nursing] left about 1,000 students moved with them to the [University Park  campus]. With them enrollment dropped drastically," Moncarz said.

But, BBC has made a strong move to fight back the enrollment drop, according to Moncarz.

"The increase of students in classes taught by the College of Arts and Science and the School of Journalism, relocation of students, accessibility, and the kindness of the staff," Moncarz said.

New students have replaced those students who left or graduated and part of the School of Nursing has returned with the foreign physicians program, which allows doctors from foreign countries to become registered nurses in the United States

The presence of additional students has been felt throughout campus, especially in the evening, according to professor Constantine Kalogeras. 

"Attendance is greater in evening classes compared to morning session. In [the] day, my class attendance is poor with students missing two or more classes but with my evening classes there are maybe only one to two absences," Kalogeras, a finance professor with the college of business said.

However, Katrina Silva, who attends class in the morning, has been inconvenienced by the lack of parking spaces.

"I always have to park in the back towards the entrance. They should make parking lots where the grass area is, but other than that I haven't noticed [more students on campus]," Silva, a student majoring in hospitality management said.  

Also, the Fall semester brings the largest enrollment for colleges in the United States with incoming freshman, transfer students and returning students enrolled. It is the most popular time to attend college. According to the office of Institutional Research, 6,732 students were enrolled at BBC in the 2005 Spring semester.

"Some students attend during the Fall semester but take off during the Spring due to studying abroad or quitting after the fall semester," said Michelles Nanes, who is majoring in  human resources.

Another student, Fernand Thomas, noticed a drop in enrollment in certain classes while students enrolled in other classes maintained good attendance.  

"In my statistics class there were about 52 students in the beginning and now there are about 25. And, in my management class there were 48 in the beginning and there are still 48 students," Thomas, a finance major said.

However, Onel Hidalgo, who attends class in the morning has noticed an increase in enrollment. 

"I have noticed a lot more students on campus. I look at the hallways and they're more crowded this semester," Hidalgo, who is majoring in anthropology said.

Subheadline: Posture may be linked to how you feel physically
Author: Edwin Ryan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It is said that parents know best. As a child, my mother always said "Stand up straight!" "Pull your shoulders back!" and "Don't slouch in your chair." 

We were told to have good posture. However, we were seldom taught effective ways to accomplish this. 

The old axiom "what you don't know can hurt you" holds true when examining what we actually know about posture. 

Even though we were constantly told to maintain this position, we were never told what good posture is or what the negative effects of faulty posture are. 

I once had a female client who ran the 10k marathon. I was able to cut her 10k time to 40 minutes with strength and conditioning, but she was stuck at that time. Then, I learned how to assess posture and how to correct faulty postural problems caused by muscle imbalances. 

I assessed my client and found that she had muscle imbalances in her trunk muscles with accompanying forward shoulders. 

I corrected her posture with the appropriate strengthening and stretching exercises, taught her how to be more aware of her posture and her time went from 40 to 38 minutes (a five percent improvement). For those who run competitively, you know the big difference two minutes could make on your 10k time.

For ease of discussion, posture may be defined as a state of balance between the muscles and ideal alignment of bones and joints which protects against progressive deformity regardless of body position (standing, lying, squatting, kneeling or  sitting). 

Good posture is a position where all the natural curves of the spine are present. This requires adequate muscle flexibility, strong postural muscles and good muscle balance on both sides of the spine and awareness of your own posture. 

Good posture decreases stress on the bones of the spine, as well as other body structures, prevents the spine from becoming stuck in abnormal positions and allows full efficient movement of all joints in the body during exercise and daily activities. It also helps you to look and feel better and prevents muscle fatigue. 

With good posture, all the natural curves of the spine are maintained. When viewed from the side, the spine has four natural curves: At the neck - slight inward curvature, at the upper back - slight outward curvature, at the lower back - slight inward curvature and at the pelvis - slight outward curvature. 

Additionally, the plumb line should fall through the body's center when viewed from the side. (Figure 1).

Poor posture is a faulty relationship of the various parts of the body and spinal curves, which produces increased stress on muscles, bones and joints.  

Moving away from the natural position of the spine can place tremendous stresses on various body structures. 

The degree of stress is dependant upon the length of time the faulty position is held and the amount of movement away from the normal position. Faulty posture may lead to forward head and rounded shoulders with an increased lower back curvature (Figure 2), a flat back (Figure 3) or a swaying posture (Figure 4). 

This may cause backaches, headaches, restricted breathing and it affects the quality of daily and sporting activities.  

The assessment of posture is usually done by a knowledgeable personal fitness trainer, certified athletic trainer or physical therapist. 

However, if you know you have been adopting any of the faulty positions above, you should start by taking some positive steps toward improving your posture by never slouching when you sit in your chair. 

Many students sit with very bad posture (Figure 5). 

This places tremendous stress on the lower back and may eventually result in either a flat back or sway back position. 

To correct this, one should attempt to always sit in an upright position with the back supported and the natural inward curve of the lower back present (Figure 6). Perform moderate stretching of the chest muscles (pectorals). 

To do this, bring your arms horizontal and flare your elbows (Figure 7).  Please note that doing extreme stretching for the chest muscles, such as leaning into a door, may actually cause your shoulders to become unstable. One should also include exercises which strengthen the lower back and the muscles between the shoulder blades. 

A good exercise for this is a modified cobra (Figure 8). Lie face down with your palms at your sides facing the floor. 

Lift your chest and shoulders off the floor while rotating your shoulders so that your thumbs point toward the ceiling.

 The shoulder blades should also be scrunched together as you lift up. Hold for two seconds then return to the floor.  You can start with 10 repetitions for one set, and increase as you get stronger. 

Strengthen your abdominals and finally, become more aware of your posture during daily activities and exercise.  

Other muscles that may need strengthening are the ones to the front of your neck, which I recommend seeking advice from a fitness professional, certified athletic trainer or physical therapist. 

An important muscle that you may need to stretch is the muscle in front of your hips (hip flexors). 

You can do this by exaggerating your stance so that one foot is about one meter ahead of the other, then push your hips forward and hold for 10-15 seconds (Figure 9). 

It is also critical to understand how your posture can affect the way you feel. 

If you stand up straight, and walk tall, you will actually think and feel better. 

In closing, I would like to emphasize that good posture should be maintained during all activities. 

If after reading this you're still not convinced by the aesthetic and health benefits of good posture, at least you can rest assure that the next time you visit your mom, and you have good posture, she will be extremely happy.

Headline: Goblet of Fire: "too much" too fast
Author: Angelina Esposito / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Anticipation was in the air at the midnight premiere of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Potter fans were already forming an entrance line more than two hours before show time. 

Fanatics seemed to be a happy lot, with a wide age range from teenagers to middle-aged adults, eagerly discussing their love for J. K. Rowling and their feelings towards the fourth film of the Harry Potter series. 

However, die-hard Harry Potter fans may feel a tad bit let down by the movie.

While it is understandable to make necessary cuts due to time constraints, it doesn't excuse the cut and paste feel at the beginning of the movie - an attempt to cram too much detail into a very short time slot caused disorientation at first, but thankfully, the extreme dash through necessary information wasn't repeated. 

Also, many of the details the viewer is supposed to pick up on feels forced and at times awkward. This is mostly apparent with the introduction of new characters, instead of giving them much depth, they barely skim the surface and try to get by on just enough to make sure the movie doesn't get confusing. 

Even the trio seems a bit shallow this time around, once again I'd blame it on time constraints - it's hard to get into individual development when you're just scraping by on the leads. 

Also, the character Dumbledore doesn't live up to the same calm soul he was portrayed as in previous movies and the books. Is it the actor or the director giving him a more impulsive demeanor? This new Dumbledore gives off a more aggressive air, which could lead to plot trouble later on in the series.

Though fanatics of Harry Potter may be annoyed, it doesn't take away the fact that over all, it's a good movie. 

The new director, Mike Newell, seems to have created a balance - the movie isn't as dark as its predecessor Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and it doesn't digress to the innocent light-hearted feeling of the first, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. 

Instead, a happy medium was found somewhere in between. Which is good, considering that it is the first of the movies to be given a PG-13 rating, where as the others were a PG. 

The balance keeps the age difference of the audience from being a factor, keeping the fantasy and cute jokes for the pre-teen crowd, while incorporating more adult themes for its older viewers.

Both avid readers and new-comers are sure to enjoy this movie. Excellent visuals, computer graphics, and overall entertaining storyline are all factors that make this film stand out among its predecessors. 

Though you may not leave the theater smiling, you are guaranteed a few laughs along the way, whether it's from the Weasley twins and their crazy antics, or a very unwelcomed ghost.

Subheadline: The cheap and easy way to lick Thanksgiving
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Assistant Editor
&nbsp;
Between paying for tuition, books and board, many college students can't afford the luxury of going home for Thanksgiving. This can be jarring to the newly displaced student still adjusting to campus life and probably feeling a bit homesick in the process. There's no need to fret, though - you can still participate in a glutton fest, creating new homemade traditions without slaving (too much) over a hot stove or blowing your allotted future parking ticket money. 

The Cheap and Easy Route:

This method is intended for the students juggling six classes, a part-time job, who have only a microwave accessible to them and consider any meal over $5 as "fine dining."

This method is intended for the students juggling six classes, a part-time job, who have only a microwave accessible to them and consider any meal over $5 as "fine dining."

Yams: 

Canned yams or sweet potatoes are just as good as fresh ones. At least you can tell yourself that as you add the second pouch of marshmallows.

Turkey:

Martha Stewart may not approve, but if you close your eyes tight enough, turkey bacon can taste like the most succulent drumstick.

Mashed Potatoes:

For just under $1, Idahoan makes individual sized instant potatoes in a variety of flavors. It also makes great paper mache mix. 

Stuffing:
  
Stove Top, strangely enough, is best made in the microwave. It's a good thing college teaches you to free your mind.

Cranberry Sauce:
 
I suggest skipping this Thanksgiving staple when using this menu. Dipping turkey bacon into cranberry sauce may make you weep over what your life has become.

Pie:
  
Did somebody say McDonalds? I just did.

An Alternate Route:

This is intended for the student with little regard for the holidays or who has simply failed at the first method.

1 ½ Oz. Wild Turkey 
Bourbon Whisky
1/2 Oz. Apple Brandy
1 Tsp. Lime Juice
4 Oz. Cranberry Juice

Fill a glass halfway with ice, add ingredients and watch the holidays fly by.

Headline: XBOX 360
Subheadline: New game console arrives in time for holidays
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Gamers will be swarming to stores on, Nov. 22 to pick up Microsoft's latest videogame console the Xbox 360. Microsoft hopes to capture a substantial piece of the console gaming market by satisfying gamers' appetites for better graphics and gameplay.

To appeal to both casual gamers and hardcore fans, the company has decided to release the new system in two packages.

Casual players will be able to pick up the core system for $299.99. This basic package includes the system, one wired controller, a faceplate and the standard audio/visual cables. 

For an extra hundred dollars, consumers can purchase the system's premium package. Retailing at $399.99, this package also includes the system and faceplate, but replaces the wired controller with a wireless one and adds a 20-gigabyte hard drive, headset, ethernet cable component audio/visual cables and a remote control.

"I love the fact that Microsoft is offering two different packages for buyers. For people who don't play videogames too much, the cheaper package lets them experience next-generation games at a more reasonable price," said freshman Antony Patsan.

Although Microsoft is offering two different packages, the company's offering of a premium package marks the start of rising videogame prices. The Xbox 360 premium package costs $100 more than the original Xbox hardware and many of the new system's games are set to retail for $59.99, a ten dollar increase over the previous system's game prices. The price hike is due to the increased costs of hardware development and game programming. 

Even though videogame prices are increasing, consumers are enjoying a richer gaming experience due to technological advances.  

Compared to its predecessor, the Xbox 360 is significantly more powerful and more capable of handling expansive games. 

While the original Xbox contained only one processor, its successor runs on three. Because of the new system's substantial horsepower, gamers will experience improved graphics, shorter load times and an overall better quality  of games. 

Aside from being more powerful, the Xbox 360 is backwards-compatible, allowing people to play their favorite Xbox games on the new system, meaning if fans are itching to play a quick round of "Halo", they don't have to set up their old Xbox to play.

Nonetheless, backwards-compatibility is limited to best-selling games. The lack of total backwards-compatibility in the Xbox 360 has some fans angry.

"When Microsoft announced that the new system could play the older system's games, I was ecstatic about the news. After the company said that only select games would be playable on the Xbox 360, I was pretty disappointed in the decision," said sophomore Danny Cruz. 

By coming out this holiday season, the Xbox 360 has a sizable advantage over its competitors, the Sony PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Revolution, which are both set to come out sometime next year. 

The Xbox 360's ideal release date allows the system to establish itself in consumers' homes long before its competitors appear on the market. 

Since the console is coming out in time for the holidays, it is guaranteed to be on many people's wish lists.

"I've been looking forward to getting an Xbox 360 ever since the system was first announced," said freshman Keenan Ho.

"Because it's coming out a month before Christmas, I can save my money and have my parents buy me one." 

Nineteen games are scheduled to be released alongside the Xbox 360  Nov. 22. All types of gamers will be satisfied by the variety of choices available upon the system's release. The games range from sports franchises such as "Madden NFL 06" to first-person shooters like "Perfect Dark Zero." 

Nevertheless, the system's true value will be tested when Sony and Nintendo release their next-generation consoles.

With its advanced technology, ideal release date and diverse game library, the Xbox 360 should be a best-seller this holiday season.
