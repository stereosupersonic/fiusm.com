The Golden Panthers' softball team has won five of seven games thus far during the Blue and Gold Felsberg Memorial Tournament being held from March 2-13 at University Park. The tournament consists of five teams: Stonybrook, Mount St. Mary's and UNC-Wilmington, Western Kentucky and Rutgers.



FIU 2, 

Stonybrook 1



Sophomore outfielder Kim Rodriguez hit a solo home-run against Stonybrook and senior catcher Tabitha Embry's extra-inning single scored the game-winning run.

Junior Kerry Houck (2-7) allowed five hits during her eight innings of work.



FIU 8, 

Mount St. Mary's 0



Sophomore Penny Eastman (3-5) dominated Mount St. Mary recording a one-hit shut-out.

UNC-Wilmington 4, FIU 3 



Seahawks pitcher Jess Luckett allowed three runs during her complete game victory. The Golden Panthers headed to the bottom half of the final inning trailing 4-1. Luckett struggled as she allowed a two-run home run to junior outfielder Ashley Falk.

Despite the home run, Luckett finished the game recording a groundout.



FIU 7, 

Mount St. Mary's 0



Eastman (5-5) was four outs away from recording a no-hitter. Pinch hitter Amanda Buckel's double to left field was the first Mount St. Mary's hit of the game. Eastman won her third consecutive game in as many starts.

Headline: Late inning heroics spark comeback win over Boston College
Author: Roberto Cartagena / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers bounced back from a disappointing defeat March 4 to beat Boston College 11-10 March 6 at University Park Stadium.

It looked to be a long night when last year's staff ace, Walker Whitley, who converted to closer this year and was named the starter for this game, gave up a solo shot to the first batter he faced.

However, Whitley was able to find his groove and consistently used his slider and fastball to keep the Eagles' (1-6) hitters off balance. "I looked back at film, and noticed I was pitching more upright last year," he said.

That seemed to be the difference as Whitley would not give up another run until the fifth inning and ended up striking out six batters for the game.   

It was a see-saw game throughout the night.

The Golden Panthers (10-6) would even the score, 1-1, in the third inning. Junior Raimy Fuentes led off with a double and eventually scored on a sacrifice fly by Brian Adams.

The Golden Panthers found themselves in a hole late in the game after Boston College scored five runs in the top of the seventh.

The Golden Panthers responded with four runs of their own in the bottom of the inning, led by junior outfielder James McOwen's three run homer. 

"The pitcher threw a change up in, followed by a fastball away, the previous at bat," McOwen said. "When he threw a change up this time around, I figured he would come back with a fastball."

Trailing 10-7 in the bottom of the ninth, the Golden Panthers again responded.

Junior second baseman Corey Lozano led off the inning with a double. 

The very next batter, junior third baseman Bryan Pullin, was hit by a pitch, which prompted the Eagles to make a pitching change.

Boston College first baseman, Micheal Belfiore was brought in to pitch, but he wasn't any better. 

He immediately gave up an RBI single to McOwen, followed by a hit from senior catcher Luis Bautista.

Boston College leftfielder Jared Mcguire overran the ball and both Pullin and McOwen ended up scoring.

Coach Danny Price then decided to bring in speedy senior outfielder Chris Dunn to pinch run for Bautista.

Dunn was able to reach third on a wild pitch by Belfiore, which made it easy for freshman Tyler Townsend to do what he's done all season - hit.  

Townsend knocked in Dunn with a singe that went between short and second.

"I didn't feel any pressure with Chris Dunn at third and no outs," Townsend said after knocking in the game winning run.

Headline: MAKING A SPLASH: Lowell named Sun Belt diver of the year
Author: Chris Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Junior diver Lindsay Lowell has always looked up to her mother for advice when it came to athletics. It was never more apparent than the first time she experienced diving.

"My mother was a gymnastics coach and judge, but I was never able to get into it," Lowell said. "One day she began teaching diving at the local pool, and I fell in love the second I experienced it."

Fourteen years later, she's been a four-time state qualifier at Cooper City High School, received multiple scholarship offers, a pair of conference honors and, most notably, the Sun Belt Conference Diver of the Year. After all this, she hasn't looked back.

Lindsay grew up practicing and working at the Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale. 

Often times she would watch the top international divers practice and compete, but never looked towards becoming an Olympian or even an international competitor.

"It distraught me how the professionals were completely consumed by diving," Lowell said. "I wanted a scholarship, sure, but the key for me was to be able to balance sports with my life."

Don't think that means Lowell is slacking.  

Each preseason consists of heavy weight training, conditioning and stretching. In comparison to other sports, diving requires nearly unparalleled attention to detail, which means every fraction of her technique must be studied, analyzed and perfected.

"It's what scares a lot of people away from participating. Knowing that every action you make directly relates to your score keeps many from ever trying," Lowell said.

While attending Cooper City High School, Lowell qualified for the state championships all four years, and the hard work paid off. Schools like Connecticut and Massachusetts - among others - came calling, but she finally settled on the North Carolina State.

However, she felt she was not developing with her team or coach and decided that she would have to return to south Florida.

Torn between the Golden Panthers and Florida Atlantic, it ultimately came down to FIU diving coach Bryan Gillooly and the relationship the two of them developed.

"Coach Gillooly has been amazing to me, both as an instructor and as a friend," Lowell said. "His positive reinforcement and plain knowledge has been helping me more then I could have hoped for the past two years."

Though diving has been such an intricate part of Lindsay's life for the past 14 years, she recently came to a startling realization upon meeting with her academic advisor.

"It hit me that I only had one year left in college," she said. "One more year of diving. It was then I realized that diving wasn't going to last forever, that I was going to have to move it to the backseat soon and embrace my career."

Lowell has held an internship with an advertising agency and is majoring in communications and public relations. With only a year left, her 14-year run will be coming to a close and it will be time to face the real world. But that doesn't mean she's satisfied with herself yet.

"Winning diver of the year was an amazing surprise, since I had been having a rough year and it was great to see my hard work paying off," Lowell said. "But I still want to win both conference championships. I came really close last year and simple mistakes cost me."

As the end inevitably draws near, Lowell practices every day, with the intention, as she puts it, "to be better than I was the day before."

Headline: BARRED FROM VOTING: Felons in Florida who've served their time deserve equal rights
Author: David Focil / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In Florida, a law created in 1869 bans convicted felons from voting, even after they have served their sentences. In order to regain their right to vote, ex-felons must appeal to the clemency board in Tallahassee, a process that takes months or even years, due to an excessive backlog of applications. An estimated 950,000 ex-felons are ineligible to vote under this law.

To some this may seem like justice. After all, why should someone who broke the law be allowed to have a say in the affairs of law-abiding citizens? The problem is not that they broke the law and must now suffer the consequences; the problem is that they have already paid the consequences with their very freedom.

Some of these felons have spent years in prison for their crimes and have followed all the requirements of their sentences. If this were not the case, they would still be in prison.

One of the foundations of the Republic is the right to cast your vote, to have your voice be recognized as valid, and deriving from it, political power. These felons have already been denied that power by captivity in prison. They have served a period of time where their very essence as free human beings was removed, where choice and will was replaced with obedience and uniformity. 

The people of Florida judged these individuals for their crimes, found them guilty and made them pay.

Once that time is up and they are released, why should they not be allowed to be fully functioning citizens?

Some would say it is a matter of race and politics. After all, many of those ex-felons happen to be African-American or other minorities.

Perhaps it is no coincidence that this law was passed in the same year as the 15th amendment, granting African-Americans the right to vote.

Some have even suggested that the votes of these felons could have changed the results of several elections in recent years, including that of the president. 

Many of these people blame the system for ending up in jail; they may support those candidates that seem to be fighting that system, and the injustice it promotes.

Whether or not this is true, the fact remains that these ex-felons will be paying taxes with the work that they can get. I seem to recall a little revolutionary war being fought over the issue of taxation without representation.

This is a matter that strikes not just those of a particular race, but also all citizens in our great country.

Furthermore, during the 2000 presidential campaign, up to 12,000 legitimate voters were misidentified as ex-felons, raising the issue of disenfranchisement to the wider community. Thankfully most of them were cleared of this error, but up to 4,000 may have still been barred from voting in the election.

It seems as if things may change. After shifting positions on the issue during the gubernatorial campaign, Governor Charlie Crist now seeks to grant ex-felons voting rights after over 100 years of disenfranchisement. On March 1 he met with members of the clemency board in an effort to get the ban lifted.

While most of the members will go on record supporting the reinstatement of voting rights, the governor is not sure if he has enough votes to do it.

Let us hope, for the sake of our Republic and our state, that those entrusted with public power will restore voting rights to those who have already suffered the consequences of their deeds. This measure would  help not to protect criminals, but simply to protect the right of free and fair representation as an intrinsic value of our society.

Headline: Press unfairly judges Ann Coulter for insensitive remarks
Author: Jose Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It seems as of late that the American people have adopted a faux facade of hypersensitivity to what they perceive as "bigoted" comments. The media attempts to essentially ruin certain people for merely utilizing their constitutionally given right to free speech.

The media has not taken a very amiable stance toward controversial comments, as is evidenced by the rabid manner in which they have jumped on conservative commentator Ann Coulter's recent remarks, in which she threw a slur often used against homosexuals to aspiring Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards.

"I was going to have a few comments on the other Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, but it turns out you have to go into rehab if you use the word 'f----t,' so I - so kind of an impasse, can't really talk about Edwards."

Coulter was referring to actor Isaiah Washington, best known for his role on the television series "Grey's Anatomy." Washington is alleged to have made remarks in an on-set altercation, in which he referred to a co-star as a f----t. 

Washington underwent counseling, most likely due to pressure from the studio and the media. He went on to publicly apologize for his comments.

Similarly, Coulter has been subjected to remarkable pressure from her publishers, the major television news networks, the Republican party, the general public, even the advertisers on her website.

In response to the seemingly incessant criticism she has been receiving, Coulter felt compelled to issue a rebuttal of sorts on the conservative talk show "Hannity and Colmes."

"F----t isn't offensive to gays; it has nothing to do with gays.... It's a schoolyard taunt meaning 'wuss,' and unless you're telling me that John Edwards is gay, it was not applied to a gay person." 

Edwards has also sought to profit off of the entire debacle, urging his supporters to donate $100,000 in "Coulter Cash," in what he dubbed an attempt to "show that inflaming prejudice to attack progressive leaders will only backfire."

I do not blame the Republicans for wanting to distance themselves from the much-reviled Coulter, in lieu of all the other scandals they have been stricken with recently. The same goes for the corporations advertising on her website, who stand to lose a profit by mere affiliation with Coulter.

However, it seems as if the media is mischaracterizing her comments in an effort to appear to be tough on homophobia, while ignoring the fact that this is the most bigoted nation on the planet.

Though I oppose racism and homophobia, it is not within anyone's right to systematically renounce someone for expressing their genuine opinion, even if they do so in a highly scrutinized forum.

I do not condone nor agree with Coulter's comments and feel they were flagrantly impetuous, but I cannot help but begin to be slightly agitated by the systematic effort to prevent this woman from expressing her opinions, however ludicrous and farcical they may be.

Moreover, her opinions should not be disregarded simply because she made one comment that can be interpreted as homophobic. 

We must remain aware of the fact that there is free speech in this country, and also acknowledge the fact that bigotry is omnipresent.

It is approximated that 45 percent of gay males and 20 percent of lesbians report having experienced verbal harassment and/or physical violence as a result of their sexual orientation during high school.

Coulter's comments can hardly be singled out as a unique phenomenon. Condemning her in the court of public opinion will not change that.

Headline: Mail list promotes community service activities
Author: Christopher Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Patricia Temino, assistant director for the Center for Leadership and Service, believes altruism is in the heart of FIU students. It's just a matter of finding an outlet for them to show it, she says. 

She hopes to be proven right through the Rory Community Calendar, a new program the center offers promoting one-time volunteer projects through e-mail. 

"I think college students really do care [about helping others]. A lack of information on how to get involved is the biggest problem. If students were aware of the opportunities, they would really make a difference," Temino said. 

RCC works very simply: Community organizations contact the center with projects and activities in need of volunteers. The center then adds the events to a calendar that is e-mailed to the students on a weekly basis. 

Because there is no long-term agreement and all students have to do to attend an event is RSVP - instead of having to go through organizational screenings or questionnaires, -it is easy for students to get involved in the projects. 

"It is already planned and set, all they have to do is come," Temino said. 

RCC launched Jan. 30 and Temino hopes it will be a success and remain for a long time.

The activities are very diverse. In January, students volunteered at the Good Hope Equestrian Training Center, a center offering therapeutic horseback riding for people with disabilities, and in February, volunteers helped cleanup Virginia Beach. 

There are 15 activities planned for this semester, which include volunteering at a Special Olympics and helping restore natural areas.

According to Temino, it's easy to get involved. All students have to do is contact the center by telephone, e-mail or by visiting the center and joining the mailing list. 

Once in the system, e-mails will be sent once a week promoting and describing the different activities. The center does not currently have a website with project listings, but are planning to have one by the end of the Spring semester. 

Anyone is welcome to participate, and the only requirement besides wanting to be involved is to be a student, Temino said.

There is an evaluation at the end of each activity to help the center improve its services. 

"We are really trying to reach students and give them what they want on these activities," Temino said. 

There is something to do each weekend, and the duration of the activities can range anywhere between two hours to the whole day. 

For those interested in taking on a leadership role, the center needs a project manager for either the entire semester or for a single activity.

Being a project manager requires no previous experience, Temino said.

Harold Silva has been a project manager with RCC in different activities such as beach clean ups and child tutoring. 

Project manager is an opportunity to gain leadership skills, Silva said

Headline: Students lobby in Tallahassee
Author: Christopher Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Between midterms, papers, work and other obligations, 20 Student Government Association members traveled nine hours to Tallahassee March 7 and 8 to represent the University at the start of this year's legislative sessions.

On March 8, also known as FIU Day, the students were divided into groups and taken to the offices of senators and representatives, where the students had the opportunity to meet them and talk about the University's goals.

Some of the key issues discussed were enrollment growth, the technology fee and the College of Medicine, which has been given the green light by the Board of Governors but is now in need of funding. 

"One of the major issues that we were pushing for was the institution of the technology fee. And the word fee scares most students, but this fee would actually be the stepping stone to better technology in the classrooms, fully wireless campus, and the end of the $299 online fee [charged for online courses]," said Student Government Association member Kenny Gelok, director of student legislative affairs,

Representative Anitere Flores, who met with the students and who represents District 114 (Kendall, Westwood Lakes and the area surrounding FIU) praised the students' dedication.

"The best lobbyists the University has is the students themselves and anything from a tuition change to the public policy to what the University will look like will effect the students," Flores said. "It's equally important for us as legislators [to see how] the policies we make affect the lives of students."

And as far as the students meeting in person with the representatives rather than communicating approval via mail, Flores said that "the most effective way to advocate for an issue is face to face contact. It's crucial because it also gives time for interaction between the legislature and the students."

"Now the key is for us to follow up and take any issues or suggestions given to us [by the legislators]," said Cassandra Andrade, a member of FIU's Model United Nations. 

Providence Okoye, vice president of the Student Government Council at University Park, gave her impression of the legislators. 

"They were perfect. They paid attention and even when we didn't get a chance to meet with the representatives themselves, their aids were great and they made sure to let us know they would convey our issues to the legislators." 

Besides some downfalls - such as the student's bus getting a flat tire on the way back, leaving the group stuck on the road for three hours - the students succeeded at voicing their concerns and asking state senators and representatives for more funding.

"I am very passionate about my university; I bleed blue and gold. Every student that went on this trip, if they did not have this same passion they wouldn't have been able to speak with the legislators. They all have this passion for the University," Providence said.

Headline: CRIME SCENE: Students use forensics to solve crimes
Author: Khadija Harris / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The popular CBS drama "CSI:Miami" kicked off in 2004. But in 1997, Kenneth Furton had already founded FIU's International Forensic Research Institue - the only program in the nation that has full accreditation for its undergraduate certificate and graduate degree programs, and currently has over 80 students registered.

Although shows like the nationally viewed investigative drama series "CSI" may have created an interest in the field, Furton doesn't think the TV show realistically portrays forensics.

"Even though 'CSI' is inaccurate and doesn't show what forensic scientists really do, it generates interest in the field, so it isn't a really bad thing," he said.

Besides having a brilliant intuition, which is what shows like "CSI" portray, Furton offered other qualities required to become a forensic scientist.

"Students must be inquisitive and have an interest in solving problems," Furton said.

Furton added that the average forensic scientist doesn't work with dead bodies. Autopsies are instead performed by the medical examiner or the coroner's office.

FIU had been offering forensic science programs for over 30 years at various levels before the institute formed 10 years ago. The IFRI currently is one of the largest academic forensic science centers in the United States and is funded by government grants and over $1 million from annual state funds.

Because of IFRI's advanced equipment, the institute is truly making a name of itself in the forensic field. It has partnered with laboratories in countries around the world, mainly in the UK and Australia, where the labs exchange research findings. Also, IFRI works with labs in Latin American and the Caribbean to help develop counterterrorism techniques.

The IFRI excels at the local level as well by offering its services to the Miami-Dade police and other crime labs such as the DEA.

Part of its success is due to its location. There is a large concentration of labs in South Florida, five within the Broward/Miami-Dade area where more than 100 scientists test and perfect techniques in these labs.

More than 20 FIU students went to the American Academy of Forensic Sciences Conference held in Austin, Texas, last month. This annual meeting is a major event in the field of forensic where scientists and students from around the world present their findings and techniques to their colleagues. The FIU delegation presented projects on subjects ranging from training dogs to detect explosives, to getting DNA from human hair. FIU had more students at the convention than any other university and has been leading the pack since 2003.

IFRI offers workshops throughout the year for students and scientists who want to learn new techniques and update old ones. The workshops are part lecture and part on-the-job experience, with mock crime scenes and displays allowing students to truly get a hands-on practice. These workshops are very intense with a great amount of work focused into one day. 

In the research facilities, the students have access to DNA profiling, trace analysis and toxicology equipment, using some of the most advanced instruments in the world such as electron microscopes that shoot electrons to scan specimens, and mass spectrometers, which can break down an object and tell the scientist what it's made of.

Mike Macias, a graduate student working on a forensic science Ph.D., enjoys the wide spectrum of new techniques offered by the institute.

"It keeps things interesting. I have a good time. I find something fascinating about chemistry, even though others might find it boring," Macias said.

Headline: The Meaning of Life....a column looking for the answers: Few willing to share answers to life's questions
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Once, I remember well, my life was a feast where all hearts opened and all wines flowed.

- Arthur Rimbaud, A Season in Hell



I'm not going to deny it - I've been taking the easy way out with this column, spotlighting people I know in my ongoing search for the meaning of life. Though I've so far been able to compare life to an adventure, a sad routine and the extravagance of a rock star, the people I used to exemplify these themes were acquaintances that just happened to fit that week's mold.

This week, I decided to go out on the street and ask strangers if life had any meaning for them, just to see what reaction I'd get.

Most people I ran into laughed and wouldn't take the question seriously or just ignored me. A girl I saw studying in the Green Library picked up her things and silently moved to another side of the building, perhaps scared off by the way I started the conversation (I asked her if she was into metaphysical literature and then I delved into the meaning of life question. She was, after all, standing next to the library's bust of Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges).

Rejection didn't bother me as much as the awkward answers, though. A group of sophomores I interviewed sitting by the turtle pond near the Ryder business building giggled and gave me rhetorical gems such as "Is there life to a meaning?" and "Which came first, the meaning or the life?"

Some answers did manage to surprise me. Reana Smith, a junior majoring in English, didn't mind telling me that her life is just a quest for practical knowledge. Her hero is Arthur Rimbaud, the rebel teen poet who made a career out of scandalizing French society as much as he did writing lyrical masterpieces.

"I think scholars remember Rimbaud as the kid who f----d other famous guy poets and wrote some interesting things on the side. But I read his biography in high school and I just fell in love with what he stood for, what people ignore today," she said.

Smith pointed out that Rimbaud was always reading scientific texts, mechanical journals and every book he could get a hold of just so there would never be anything he didn't know.

"He was a poet but he was also an explorer of life," Smith said. "More than figuring out why we're here, I want to know how we got here and what we're going to do now that we're here."

Although I was fascinated by Smith's educated response to my question, it was the easiness with which she answered that really intrigued me.

I consider my search for the meaning of life to be a valid quest while still realizing that the question has become a philosophical cliché parodied in popular culture (see The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for further clarification).

I'm surprised, however, by the reluctance I met from people who would not want to answer the question. One student even gave me his number and told me to call him back later. I did. He didn't pick up.

In Thomas More's Utopia, citizens of an imaginary country spend their idle hours discussing philosophy and the meaning of life. I've found that in the real world, hearts won't open so easily, that perhaps one's life is too intimate to share with a stranger asking questions by a bust of Borges. I wish, though, that with a question like this, people would be more willing to stop and if not share, at least consider the query.

- The search continues every other Monday in The Beacon's Life! section.

Headline: PARTY IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD: Local hotels offer alternatives to costly vacation
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
At times, a nearby home-away-from-home is the best way to enjoy your Spring Break. Whether it's because you're a little low on cash and looking for a suite to split among friends or because you just need to get out of your dorm room, no matter the cost, renting a hotel room might just be a quick fix in your hunt for Spring Break fun.

Miami, being the tourist hot spot that it is, sometimes has too many hotels to choose from. So how do you know which ones keep their promises of white, fluffy pillow-top beds and which ones destroy any signs of customer satisfaction right from the start? 

If the best parties are those in your own backyard, these are a couple of hotels that are sure to bring something different, beyond your barbeque grill and sprinklers.



Seacoast Suites

5101 Collins Avenue

305-865-5152



If a beachfront condo without the Miami Beach crowds is what you're looking for, then Seacoast Suites may be for you.

The Winterhaven is a good little escape if you want to be right where all the action is. The rooms offer beautiful views of the ocean and even though they're a little cramped, they do have a warm, welcoming feel to them. Many restaurants, including Finnegan's Way (13 Street and Ocean Drive) and the 24-hour Jerry's Famous Deli (14 Street and Collins Ave.) are mere feet away, as well as many trendy shops. The highlight, though, is that the shore is just within reach at this South Beach spot. Standard Room - $187 / Ocean Front - $244.33



Tudor Hotel and Suites

1111 Collins Avenue

305-534-2934



All the hottest South Beach clubs conveniently surround this cheap hidden gem. The Tudor's mega Art Deco style one bedroom suite is relatively cheap and fits a party of five comfortably. The traditional queen room is good for those party hoppers who just need a quick nap after the club and before an important meeting. Traditional Queen - $99 / Deluxe King - $109 / 1 Bedroom Suite - $139



The Chesterfield Hotel and Spa

855 Collins Avenue

Headline: Alumni promote kids' book on penmanship
Author: Carla St. Louis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For FIU alumni Leroy Adam and McSai Jean-Baptiste, reading to elementary school students is their passion. 

"We love children and working with children. We've found that's where our passion lies - feeding off the energy that children give you," Jean-Baptiste said.

Adam and Jean-Baptiste were able to promote their educational children's story, Get a Grip, Patrick on Feb. 9 while persuing their passion at Natural Bridge Elementary School.

The Beacon first reported on Get a Grip, Patrick in the article Students Address Poor Handwriting Oct. 9.

The duo co-wrote and illustrated the book with the aid of Schneyder Marc Thelus, a student majoring in computer animation at Ringling School of Art and Design.

The authors currently have not found a publishing deal. However, their book has established a cult-following of institutions and professionals within the Miami-Dade community due in part to the book's aim, which is to correct improper penmanship, and the authors' interactive presentations.

The book is beneficial for all young students and teachers such as Barbara Masuyama.

"We are still shouting 'Get a grip, Patrick' in our class," Masuyama said. The title is also the book's main catchphrase. "I find the students making more of a conscientious effort to write correctly. It accomplished more in 30 minutes than I have been able to do all year," said the third grade teacher after the Feb. 9 reading.

The duo read and displayed oversized print illustrations of the book and involved the students by asking questions about the plotline, penmanship and demonstrating the tripod method, a gripping method that improves penmanship by placing fingers in a convenient alignment.

Having experience in the classroom as educators, the authors know firsthand the difficulty of reaching young children.

 "Other stories, I don't think, really focus on the fact that you have to start where the children are. A lot of times you have to say, 'I'm struggling, too,'" Jean-Baptiste said.

Kadienne Gomez, a kindergarten teacher whose students participated in the book reading, appreciated the book's teaching methods.

"Repetition and being very detailed helps them to grasp everything - even with learning how to read," she said.

The duo has presented interactive readings at such elementary schools as Palm Lakes, Hubert O. Sibley, W.J. Bryan and Bride. 

Samuel Joseph, executive director of America Scores Miami, has agreed to aid the group.

The organization, a sub-chapter of the national after-school program, utilizes physical education, literary and community services activities to engage at-risk youth.

Joseph explained that this partnership will include a series of book readings at the organization's school program sites, and aiding the authors in obtaining a publishing deal.

 "America Scores Miami and I, personally, have committed to a long term partnership with the founders of the Get a Grip, Patrick initiative," Joseph said. 

Indeed, there's a need for Get a Grip, Patrick, according to Masuyama. 

"I have been a teacher for 11 years and this is the most effective method I have seen to teach the kids how to hold their pencils properly; I want that book."

Headline: Journalist lectures at BBC
Author: Jessica Solis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As part of its annual Hearst Distinguished Lecture Series, the School of Journalism and Mass Communication has invited award-winning author and columnist Samuel G. Freedman to discuss his latest book. 

The book, Letters to a Young Journalist, provides insight on the journalist's role in a democratic society.

The lecture will take place March 13 at 6:30 p.m., at the Mary Ann Wolfe Theatre. 

Freedman spoke to The Beacon via phone to discuss his very early days as a writer and why being a journalist is an important job.

 

Q. What made you want to become a journalist? 

I grew up in a family where we read the New York Times every morning as if it was the Bible, and that was part of it. We were very interested as a family in political issues and social issues. Also my mother had wanted to be a journalist.

 

Q. How did you go about becoming a journalist? 

I started out in junior high school. I started doing [journalism] when I was in eighth grade. Our junior high school had just been built, and there was no junior high school building before and no junior high school paper, so one of the teachers held a meeting for people that were interested to volunteer for positions they were interested in, and so I sort of boldly and recklessly volunteered to be editor in chief. 

 

Q. What do the new journalism students and the new journalists that just graduated have to look forward to?

I think there are real challenges here because there are economic challenges to the business model of traditional news organizations. There's also the challenge to the whole idea of there being such a thing as a professional journalist that detracts from both the right and the left from the "mainstream media." 



Q. Were you ever told by a public official that a meeting was private or

off-limits to you?

Usually it was pretty clear what was and what wasn't. When I was a reporter in different parts of the country, in New Jersey, in Illinois, the Sunshine laws (the public meeting laws) were pretty clear and I think sometimes we even had little cards that our editors gave us that kind of gave a quick rundown of what the public meeting law was, so we had that for reference.

 

Q. A lot of people will say the main role of the journalist in a democratic society is the role of "watch dog." Do you think that's true? 

I can't really speak to all journalists doing all things all the time, but the role of being a watch dog is a hugely important role, and I think there have been a lot of ways in which the current administration has tried to change the idea of what's private, whether it involves what's accessible in federal archives, or whether it involves Cheney's meetings with people from the oil industry. And obviously, the whole lack of civil liberties in different aspects of the war on terror. I think all of that has made journalism's work in being a watch dog. all the more important.
