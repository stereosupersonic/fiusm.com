Headline: Men's soccer still without a win
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Chances are plenty but goals are few for the men's soccer team. FIU finished the SMU Radisson Invitational with the same number of goals it had upon entering the tournament - zero. 

After a 3-0 loss to No. 11 California and a scoreless draw to Cincinnati, the Golden Panthers have yet to earn a goal or a win this season. 

Head coach Karl Kremser blames the cancelation of preseason games for FIU's 0-2-1 record.

"It's tough to come out and execute against quality teams when you haven't played any games in the preseason," he said when the team returned from Dallas. 

"But I'm proud of our guys. We've had to overcome some difficult circumstances and are coming along."



FIU 0, Cincinnati 0: 
FIU couldn't break a deadlock against Cincinnati (2-1-1), so the Golden Panthers remain winless after their Sept. 2 match. 

Blanked by California the previous day, FIU once again failed to score a goal. It was the third consecutive game an opponent earned a shut-out.

"We've been unlucky," Kremser said. "We hit the goalposts a few times and we're producing chances but we just haven't scored yet."

Junior midfielder Richard Martinez had a promising opportunity in the seventh minute. Martinez escaped his defender and released a powerful shot but it veered right of the goal post.

Freshman Christian Caporaletti and senior David Hope each had a chance minutes later but neither forward could beat Cincinnati goalkeeper Mike Vessels.

"I'm not overly concerned about that because we're producing chances," Kremser said. "If we hadn't been creating chances then I'd be worried, but I think [goals] will come once we get into game shape."

The Golden Panthers took 11 shots in the double overtime match, keeping pace with the Bearcats' 12 shots.

Cincinnati forward Kenny Anaba nearly scored the gamewinner in the 88th minute, but senior goalkeeper Sean Crowe stopped the fast moving strike. 

The match ended at 0-0 after both defenses allowed only one shot in overtime.



Cal 3, FIU 0:
FIU lost 3-0 to No.11 California in the first game of the Invitational. Still smarting from a tough defeat to rival South Florida, the Golden Panthers failed to produce a goal.

Cal (1-2-1) struck first in the 39th minute on a Jacob Wilson goal. The sophomore forward broke away from FIU defenders and found the net for the first time this season. 

Wilson's goal was all Cal would need as FIU failed to score on any of its four shots. 

"Our biggest problem more than anything is a lack of preparation," head coach Kremser said. "If you're going to play teams that good early in the year, you better be ready."

FIU nearly drew even on shots from Hope in the 47th minute and Caporaletti in the 68th minute. But an unlucky bounce off the crossbar and an agile save from Cal goalkeeper Justin Meyers kept the score at 1-0.

Defender Steve Purdy's header off a free kick gave Cal a two goal lead in the 75th minute. Ten minutes later, senior forward Matt Holtrust tapped in a cross yards away from the goal to cap the game at 3-0. 

Despite the loss, Kremser is proud of the way FIU responded against tough competition. 

"This was by no means a [typical] 3-0 game," he said. "David Hope hit the underside of the crossbar once and we actually had a penalty that the referees denied us. Things just didn't go our way."

FIU looks to end its scoring drought Sept. 8 when the team hosts Binghamton. The match will begin an eight-game home stand at University Park Soccer Stadium.

Headline: Former standout linebacker killed in motorcycle accident
Author: Charle Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
In the late afternoon of Sept. 3, FIU lost not only one of its first football players, but who many considered to be a dear friend.

Former Golden Panther Lance Preston died when he lost control of his Suzuki motorcycle. 

According to a report in The Miami Herald, he was heading southbound on the Florida Turnpike when he hit a concrete wall and fell about 81 ft. from the top of a ramp near the turnpike and Interstate 595.

Many family, former teammates and friends were informed of news late on Sept. 5. 

Former FIU quarterback and current offensive graduate assistant David Tabor was roommates with Preston for three years and both were part of FIU's first incoming recruiting class.

"It's unfortunate it happened to such a great guy and friend," Tabor said. "I always felt nobody could touch me when I was with him."

Opposing teams didn't feel as safe around him. Preston is ranked third all time at FIU for career sacks (263) and made the I-AA All-Independent second team in 2003.

On the field, one couldn't have asked for a better teammate.

When senior middle linebacker Keyonvis Bouie first came on a visit to FIU, it was Preston that gave him a tour of campus. Bouie served as understudy to Preston and attributes much of his development and success to him.

"He was one of the only players on the team that went a 100 percent every play, even in his practice," Bouie said. "He taught me so much about the game: he taught me how to read the offense and what to look for when watching film."

Other players, such as senior defensive end Antwane Barnes, who shared a locker next to Preston for three years, will remember him for his personality off the field. 

"He was a very spontaneous person. I remember one time when he bit a lizard's head off because somebody dared him to and I was like 'wow,'" Barnes said.

Although players and coaches are continuing to prepare for their game against South Florida on Saturday, many are finding it difficult to concentrate on that.

"It's a hard thing to take, especially when you're trying to prepare for a team and you keep remembering things about him every time you walk into this lockeroom, every time you walk on that field and walk in that weight room, you see pictures of him lifting in the weight room," Bouie said. "[He'll be] one of my Lb's forever." 

"This teaches you a lot about how the world is. It just shows you nobody is here forever," Barnes said.

Off the field, Preson will be remembered for his upbeat attitude.

Upon the news of his passing, his friends created a MySpace account as a memorial for him at www.myspace.com/riplp43.

There will be a viewing held Sept. 7 at Pancieria Memorial Home on 4200 Hollywood Blvd. from 3:30-7p.m. Following the viewing, a mass will be held at Nativity Catholic Church located at 5220 Johnson Street at 7:30 p.m. 

On Sept. 14, at 7 p.m., FIU will hold a campus memorial service to commemorate Preston at the FIU Football stadium. In the event of bad weather, the memorial will take place indoors at the field house adjacent to the stadium.

Headline: Croc Hunter's death tragic but expected
Author: Brian O. Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Well readers, after several near misses and years of televised encounters with reptiles from around the world, Steve Irwin, the man best known as the Crocodile Hunter, was killed Sept. 4 while filming in the Great Barrier Reef. He was filming his latest underwater documentary off the coast of Port Douglas, Australia when a stingray thrust its barb into his chest. Stingrays have a poisonous chemical on their barbs but their attacks are not usually fatal. Stingrays usually pierce a person's foot, not their heart; in this case, the attack gave Irwin a heart attack and he was pronounced dead almost immediately.

My most sincere condolences to his family aside, this story led me to remember a little thought I'd had previously, but never bothered to address. Irwin became wealthy and famous doing what he loved: preserving the wildlife and educating the public on his hit television program, "The Crocodile Hunter." This unconventional wildlife documentary series had great ratings, to the amazement of few except myself. It was a fun show, but the information it provided wasn't much compared to what you'd find on Animal Planet or the Discovery Channel. 

And then it struck me.

No one watched "Crocodile Hunter" to learn about reptiles and how to help preserve wildlife. Instead, they were infected with what I call "NASCAR syndrome:" the morbid desire to watch others getting hurt. Unlike most animal documentary filmmakers before him, Irwin always came right where the action was and got to know each animal personally, eschewing the standard zoom-up shots of other filmmakers, and people loved it. The idea of Irwin endangering his health, and sometimes his life, each episode kept people tuning in, week after week.

I noticed this mostly when discussing the show with other people.  Minutes into the conversation, the topic was bound to pop up, often in an optimistic tone: "Dude, one day, that guy is going to get hurt." People are curious creatures and many are interested in finding out just how much pain the human body can handle - as long as it's not their own bodies.  People go to NASCAR races in hopes of seeing a car wreck. Boxing cashes in on violence in its purest form. TV has caught on as well and, thanks to that, we get quality shows like "Cops" and "World's Deadliest Animals/Police Chases/Brazilian Wax Encounters."

Regardless of the real reasons Irwin's shows captured the attention of audiences worldwide, he was an accomplished animal handler and environmentalist, as well as the wacky "crikey!" guy on Animal Plantet. "NASCAR syndrome" and morbid curiosity aside, he will surely be missed.

Headline: Honors College sends mixed message with focus on grades
Author: Shawn N. Sprockett 
&nbsp;
I'll tell you right upfront, I am a member of FIU's Honors College. I've been called nerd, geek, loser, brain, intellectual and the like. I've even been awarded the Robe of Excellence, one of the highest titles the Honors College offers at Convocation. In fact, I've been in one type of "honors" class or another since fourth grade.

Nerdy egotistical ramblings aside, I have to tell you that I'm not too pleased with FIU's Honors College. 

My honors class last Spring covered the arts. We watched a video on the creative genius of Jackson Pollock, an unconventional, but gifted, painter. We learned that intelligence can be measured in many aspects, not just cold fact. We learned about the negative philosophy of Aristotle, whose elitist teachings later fueled the ideas of Hitler and Stalin and insisted on the existence of a governing superior hierarchy over the masses. Sounds like we learned a lot of good stuff, right?

I encourage people to go to the Honors College on the second floor of DM. The giant-lettered quotation on the front wall inside the Honors College office is from none other than Aristotle. The Honors College motto is

"Excellence with Honors" and is part of their letterhead that circulates on every paper they use. 

I'm going to assume that the college wants students to pursue their rigorous academics with a good attitude, clear mind, focused pace and a passion to learn. My guess is that's what they mean by "excellence."

So then why is the Honors College quoting elitists and kicking out students based on GPAs? I thought intelligence could be seen in a variety of aspects? I guess the Honors College only recognizes the cold numerical value of a student when putting together its roster.

Life isn't defined by grades on a piece of paper. Life is defined by actions and principles. I know I worked hard in my classes last semester. I know I did all my homework and that I made a sincere effort in everything I did. So I have to ask myself, do I want to surrender more time with friends, school activities, my family and work (the money from which goes straight to my tuition), so that I can raise a number?

Let's say I really want to be in the Honors College. All I would need to do is quit my job and take out loans to pay for college instead. I would need to remove myself from the many community service clubs I'm currently involved with-after all, I need to use my time doing something more "excellent." If I really want to make sure I'm in the Honors College, I should take the minimum number of classes and study all the time. Then I would have an "A" average without breaking a sweat; then I'd be in the Honors College. But is that what the Honors College wants? I hope not. 

If you ask me, excellence is about a person's integrity, morals and ethics. Those things don't show up in our GPA. I've known some really "excellent" people who've had great character and couldn't solve Pythagora's theorem, does that mean that they have not displayed "excellence?" 

I know there are teachers in the Honors College who agree with me and say that excellence requires thorough analyses of a person on many different levels. So why are GPAs the deciding factor?

The truth is I'd rather be a part of an Honors College that judges excellence based upon the kind of people their students are, not on their net output calculated and filtered through grading scales. 

But if the Honors College were to accept students based on their merit, the Honors College would lose its prestige and would not maintain its elite standing. So let's be honest: the Honors College is promoting dated, numerical views toward people. It's promoting elitism in the student body, so that those with "A's" are better than those with "B's." It's calling a higher score on a test "excellen t" and stripping the word of all of its moral and personal implications.

The Honors College needs to make a choice: either they change their slogan to "Excellence through really high GPA's" or they start admitting and retaining students based on the qualities their cherished motto professes.

Headline: WORKING OUT THE KINKS
Subheadline: Lakeview residential hall opened despite setbacks
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
In an effort to accommodate more than 800 incoming freshmen, FIU constructed Lakeview Village, the fifth and newest housing facility at the University Park campus. 

After 17 months of construction and a few shaky setbacks, Lakeview opened its doors this semester. 

However, as soon as students started moving in, the complaints started pouring. 

Students complained that the water was murky and cold because of a blocked pipe and a faulty broiler. They also said they were without cable television for several days. 

"With any new building that you open there are always quirks to adjust," said Director of Residential Life Joe Mattachione. "Our main concern is getting everybody comfortable where they're at."

Mattachione said construction workers were still onsite to paint and "fix the kinks." 

The "kinks" left students with no cable television and no hot water. Lakeview students weren't the only ones affected.

"We lost cable for a few days because they were working on connecting cable for Lakeview Hall," said Junior Sean Loret de Mola, who lives in Everglades Hall. 

Executive Director of Student Affairs Operations and Auxiliary Services Jim Wassenaar blames the hectic hurricane seasons for the construction delays and lack of preparations.

"The byproduct of this has been that a lot of the issues we would have had two months to deal with, we didn't," Wassenaar said. 

As part of the setbacks, the building's fire code inspection passed about one week before it opened to students Aug. 21, according to Wassenaar.  The project was supposed to be completed in June. 

Out of 800 cable drops, 20 aren't working properly, according to Wassenaar. Comcast crews had been onsite over the week to complete repair orders but students already filled a dozen more complaints over the long weekend.

Lakeview, which houses mostly freshmen, can cost students as much as $4,048 and includes the Flex 10 Panther meal plan. It has furnished bedrooms, a full-sized refrigerator and a private bathroom.

Lakeview can house 800 students - that's more than double the amount of students that neighboring Panther Hall can house, which is 410. 

That was also more than double the amount of work that the Residential Life Office had in getting students moved in.

"To me, this is a success story," Wassenaar said. "We really overcame some obstacles."

Lakeview will be recognized as the 2006 Outstanding Residence Hall In the Design by the American Schools and Universities magazine's November issue.

Wassenaar said one way the University addressed the problems was by sending students a letter. They also hired an outside plumber to fix a leaky sanitary pipe and are calling Comcast crews back to repair faulty cable drops.

"We're eager to resolve these problems … These are normal things that you go through when you move into a new building," Wassenaar said.

Local:
Davis, Crist win primaries in race for Florida Governor

Democratic congressman Jim Davis from Tampa who campaigned as a Tallahassee outsider and weathered ferocious attacks from one of the state's most powerful industries, won his party's nomination for governor Tuesday.

Davis will face Republican Attorney General Charlie Crist of St. Petersburg, who easily extinguished the career of one of Florida's longest-serving politicians, Tom Gallagher.

The Democratic race was more suspenseful, with the latest polls and early vote returns showing state Sen. Rod Smith of small-town Alachua closing in. 

''With all the talk of sugar in the news, let me just say, how sweet it is,'' Davis told his cheering supporters at his victory speech in Tampa. ``The voices of Florida's working families were heard above the din of special interests.''

In the Republican primary, Crist stuck to his message of preserving Bush's education agenda, going after criminals and vowing to cut taxes. He was the first candidate on television with a sophisticated ad campaign that began Memorial Day weekend.

Standing in front of a jubilant crowd of roughly 700 supporters at the Renaissance Vinoy Hotel, Crist urged the GOP to rally around him for the November election.

''Together we can give Florida a message of hope, safety and opportunity,'' Crist said. ``We know what unites us is far more powerful than anything that can divide us.''

The Florida Gubernatorial Elections are scheduled to take place on November 7.

Local Pizzeria fined for violating Labor laws

The U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday that the operator of Brooklyn Boys Pizza and Pasta restaurants in Boca Raton and Coral Springs has agreed to pay more than $11,000 in back wages to six employees and more than $11,000 in civil penalties.

The decision was made after an investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division determined the company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act.

The Labor Department said Investigators found that the employer permitted 15 year-old employees to work an excessive amount of hours and 17-year-olds to operate power-driven bakery machinery and drive vehicles used for business.

The company also allegedly failed to pay minimum wages, did not pay overtime when employees worked more than 40 hours in a work week and did not maintain proper work records, including birth dates for employees under the age of 18.


National:
Lieutenant Colonel recommends death penalty for U.S. soldiers 

According to a report obtained by The Associated Press, Army Investigator Lieutenant Colonel James Daniel Jr. has recommended that four soldiers accused of murder in a raid in Iraq should face the death penalty if convicted after concluding that the May 9 slayings were premeditated.

The soldiers, all from the Fort Campbell, Ky.-based 101st Airborne Division's 187th Infantry Regiment, are accused of killing three Iraqi men taken from a house about 60 miles north of Baghdad.

The soldiers, who have been jailed in Kuwait since their arrests this year, claim they were ordered to "kill all military age males" during the raid on the island and they were told the target was an al-Qaida training camp.

The U.S. military has not executed a soldier since the 1960 hanging of a soldier convicted of rape and attempted murder.

Headline: Career Services launch software
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the help of PantherLink, a new multi-feature online system at FIU, students and alumni are now able to manage time and keep up with busy schedules.

PantherLink, which replaced two older systems, allows users to view thousands of job listings, submit resumes, sign up for workshops and update calendars.

"These changes were in the planning stages as early as January but didn't go into effect until July 1," said Kyra Spence, E-career consultant for technology and recruitment. "Before we had two systems, but luckily for us the company that ran them integrated them."

The company is Symplicity, a company specializing in software solutions that partnered with other organizations to create the NACElink Network, which FIU then adapted to PantherLink.

Because the change took place over the summer, few students are aware of the switch to the new system.

"I hadn't heard of it until now," said senior Jarett Willis.

Some features on PantherLink are free, but a $20 payment grants students access to Golden Panther Services, which includes online resume critiques and the ability to post resumes and apply for jobs on the web.

"Last year I registered online and attempted to post my resume but didn't feel like paying," said Willis.

Students like Willis who registered before July 1 will need to register again by logging into the system using their Panther ID as their user name and password. However, most of the features on PantherLink, such as resume posting, still require that students pay the fee.

Students enrolled in the College of Business Administration are exempt because the college pays for the service.

"I think it's great you can go take classes for resume writing and that [Career Services] offers all these services, but it should somehow be made more accessible," said senior Joe Vazquez, who majors in both international relations and political science. Greater accessibility is just what the Career Services Office is trying to achieve.

"It is a lot easier to navigate through the system and there are so many more features and more ways to collect data for students and employers," said Alysa Mangal, associate director of technology for career services.  

In addition, the Career Services Office now works with the Registrar's Office so that students can register online rather than having to visit the office in person.

"There have been a few challenges," said Mangal, "but in the end it will be a positive change for our students and employers." 

The new system has garnered positive feedback. 

Students like the new calendar feature, which allows users to keep all career-related activities on one easy-to-use calendar. Another well-received feature is "the direct access the system provides to outside sources like CareerBuilder and USAJobs," said Spence.

Career Services has also planned a series of workshops and career fairs for the new semester. Upcoming workshops include Career Services 101, an overview of services offered, and How To Put Some Bling In Your Step, an interview skills class. 

The Biscayne Bay Campus Part-Time Job, Internship, and Volunteer Fair will be held Sept. 13 at the Wolfson University Center Panther Square. 

At University Park, the Graham Center Ballrooms will host the Career and Internship Fairs. Technical Day will be Sept. 25 and Non-Technical Day will be Sept. 26.

Despite all the new online services offered, however, some students still prefer to meet face-to-face with Career Service representatives.

Junior Alessandra Rodriguez recently visited the Career Services Office, located in the GC 230, to meet with a career consultant.

"I know what my major is," said Rodriguez, who majors in public health, "but I want to meet with someone to see what my options are job-wise."

Headline: First week events draw mixed crowds
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
Despite the threat of tropical storm Ernesto and bad weather postponing a couple of events, the week-long festivities of Welcome Week, organized by the University's Orientation committee, went as planned and came to a close Sept. 2. 

The series of events, collectively titled WAS-UP (Welcome All Students - University Park) were organized to welcome the University's new and returning students (numbering more than 30,000) in preparation for the Fall semester. 

The year's first Welcome Week began on Aug. 25 with the Housing Parents Social, which attracted about 20 parents and family members of resident students, according to Ron Thompson, assistant director of Residential Life.

"Participants met on the first floor of Everglades Hall while they enjoyed free pizza and soft drinks, compliments of Aramark Food Services," Thompson said.

Those in attendance also listened to presentations by University Health Services, University Police Chief Bill King and Aramark Food Services. 

The Student Programming Council's presentation of "Mission: Impossible III" also took place on Aug. 25 at 8 p.m. and went on as planned after early thunderstorms threatened to cancel the event.

Students Richard Lopez and Jamie Martinez enjoyed themselves at Liquid, a foam and pool party that took place at the Housing Quad the following day.

"It was a lot of fun relaxing at the pool with friends and enjoying the water slides," said Lopez, an SPC member.

Students were also taken on a tour of Miami. Lincoln Road, Bayside, and Coconut Groove were stops.

"We had 202 people show up for the bus tour," said Welcome Week Coordinator Alin Wakefield.

After a day of getting to know the city, freshmen gathered the following evening for the Freshman Convocation. With more than 1,500 in attendance, the event was the largest attended of the week.

"This is the largest convocation we have had to date," said FIU President Modesto Madique.  

Also happening that day was Playfair, an icebreaker event that attracted over 200 students.

"This far exceeded any of my expectations. I was worried all day long, but I will sleep good tonight," said Wakefield. 

Although the event attracted many housing students, there was a mix of commuter students as well. 

"It was fun and a great way to meet new people," said freshman Natalie Arias.  

Pantherpalooza kicked off the school week. This event was one of the poorly attended events of the week as only 11 of the 40 organizations that signed up participated. The event was meant to expose students to the various clubs and organizations at FIU. 

Even though most of the organizations did not show up, students still seemed to enjoy themselves. 

"It was pretty fun. I love free stuff and the cotton candy was pretty good," said student Andrea Vizcaino. 

After a slow Pantherpalooza, the Caribbean Students Association picked things up with a party at the GC Ballrooms. 

Though, due to Ernesto, the events scheduled for Aug. 29 and 30 were cancelled. Among the events postponed were the hypnotist show featuring Tom Deluca, the Welcome Week BBQ at the President's House and the Recreation and Wellness Expo. The hypnotist show has been rescheduled for Nov. 27 whereas the Expo. will now take place on Sept. 13. 

After the bout of foul weather, the Trail of the Torch went off without a hitch. Over 400 students attended the third annual lighting of the FIU Torch of Knowledge

 "I really don't know what it is, but it's for FIU support, and I'm here to support FIU," said junior Zeliha Beyoglu shortly before the ceremony began.

 The after party for the trail of the torch, Panther X-Plosion, brought about 200 students in between the Gold and Blue parking garages. Besides being able to enjoy the FIU-Middle Tennessee game on the wall of the Gold parking garage, students were able to jump into huge piles of foam. 

The following day's events included Cop-A-Burger, to familiarize students with the FIU Police, and the Amazing Race, a treasure hunt across the campus that had to take place indoors after bad weather disrupted plans for an outdoor event.

Welcome Week came to a close with a Karaoke night held at the Everglades Hall lounge. Over 125 students showed up.

"It was phenomenal," said Wakefield. "I think Welcome Week is on the right track for a good future."

Headline: University Park Dining offers new food options
Author: Alejandra Serna / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In preparation for the Fall semester grand opening of a series of new restaurants and eateries at University Park on Sept. 20, the Food Court at the Graham Center underwent a facelift this Summer. 

Some of the new additions include Burger King, Bene Pizza and Einstein Bros. Bagel, among others. 

What's more, already established venues inside GC, such as Pollo Tropical and Gracie's Grill, are currently being renovated.

Pollo Tropical received an expansion for the new semester due to its increased popularity. In place of the original Express version, students may now find a full-fledge Pollo Tropical resembling those found outside of campus. 

Students, such as Senior Glenda Martinez, hope this upgrade will increase the speed of production, cutting down time spent in line. 

"It's about time," said Martinez. "Hopefully, a bigger space, along with more dining options will shorten the lunch lines."

The students' resident hangout known as Gracie's Grill is also receiving minor renovations. 

Aside from some patching and painting, Gracie's menu is being revamped. The least purchased foods will be taken out to make room for more popular and student-friendly items. 

In the meantime, Resident District Manager of Panther Dining Services Jeff Naldman confirmed that they are considering replacing Gracie's for a major chain restaurant, although no name has been mentioned. 

No final decisions will be made until the end of next summer,  by which time Gracie's renovations will be completed. 

"It might be nice to have a Chili's or a Friday's on campus, but I think I might miss the atmosphere of Gracie's. There are a lot of mixed feelings there," said junior Manny Gonzalez.

University staff will work closely with SGA and other student organizations to ensure that the students continue to be accommodated for all events throughout the year as additional renovations might continue in the Spring semester. 

"It's important to keep our locations fresh and up to date. People like to dine in attractive locations," said Naldman. 

However, in spite of the new additions and the rejuvenated food court, some students still harbored mixed feelings. 

Sophomore Diana Carmichael appreciated the decision to revamp the food court but didn't like the longer lines that have formed as a result.

"Although I really like the new design and the cool art work, the long lines intimidate me and prevent me from going to eat there more often," Carmichael said. " I also think that Dining Services need to organize the queues in a much more efficient way."

Some students, such as junior Patricia Suau, were against the emergence of large corporate fast food outlets replacing familiar businesses such as Smoothie Time and Java City.

"I don't like the fact that Burger King replaced Smoothie Time," Suau said. "The staff were very personable and nice. The same thing can't be said right now. FIU is replacing small businesses with large corporations to make money."

Dining Services has confirmed that students will not be burdened with any additional cost to cover the food court's overhaul. 

Prices will continue to reflect street prices and are carefully reviewed and approved by University officials. A menu and price list have not yet been released.

Special events are already in the works to celebrate the new complex set up by Dining Services. Although all dates are presently tentative, Dining Services is working hand-in-hand with SGA in the production of the grand opening event on Sept. 20. 

In addition to all the facilities scheduled to open this Fall, two more locations are set to open in the Spring. One will be Camille's Sidewalk Café. The other, a fully licensed Starbucks Coffee located within the Green Library. 

Although all dining facilities will be up and running by the first day of classes, Food Services has warned that patrons might experience limited hours until a full staff can be hired and trained. 

"Our goal is to provide everyone a great dining experience during the peak hours we are open," said Naldman.

Some students stray from the idea of living in residence halls because of seemingly unfounded enforced policies.  With a closer look, these rules and restrictions can be justified, if at least understood.

The Resident Handbook is the publication in which housing policies and other pertinent information can be found. Each housing resident receives a handbook at his or her check in.  One can consider it the pious doctrine of all housing and residential life.   For example, the prohibitions of things like indoor smoking, underage drinking or crowding 25 people into a room merely ten by twelve feet.  

If one considers these rules in a simple, logical way, they make perfect sense. Cigarette smoking may be a relaxing and addictive pastime for some, but one must consider non-smokers who would have to wake up to the scent of ashtray seeping in through the air vents. Section 306.201.211 of Florida state law specifies that smoking is prohibited in all university buildings.  

Underage drinking is prohibited inside of the residence halls, too.  The limit on amounts of people allowed at social gatherings is rooted in legislation as well. Federal laws state restrictions on maximum occupancy in university residence halls.  

There are some regulations which some students consider inconvenient.  Signing guests in, for example, is a rule that housing residents may take lightly.  But think of it this way: in a gated community, where the residents pay extra money for the added security, guests must be registered with a guard before entering the community.  FIU residence halls adopt the same practice

Alisha Leben, a sophomore residing in Everglades Hall, says the housing policies offer her peace of mind.  "I feel safe knowing that everyone who walks into the building at any time has to check in at the front desk … it's a matter of my safety and the safety of others," she said.  

Leben is not alone.  Surveys are given out to housing students each semester, and Everglades Hall generally receives a safe rating from the majority of its residents.

Sean Gerardino, a Senior Desk Assistant in the residence halls, confirms that the housing department stresses to all the DA's and Resident Assistants how important it is that each guest is signed in.  Housing keeps records to know who is in each building and when.  

"I have had residents get mad at me because I insist on them signing in their guests. They don't seem to understand that if their guests do anything [against housing policy] the resident will be held liable," Gerardino said. "I work here a lot of nights and see the FIU Police come through periodically to make sure everything is fine."

While some students find housing policies restricting, many never realize FIU gives housing students more freedom and responsibility than other schools.  Certain universities make residents adhere to a curfew, which restricts entering or exiting the building during late hours of the night.  The most similar restriction that residence halls at FIU have is quiet hours, also known as courtesy hours, which are enforced by RA's who make rounds nightly.  These hours are from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. Sunday through Thursday, and Midnight to 10:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday.  During finals week, quiet hours extend to 24 hours per day. 

Tamara Marryshow, a second-year RA, feels that residents abide by housing policies for the most part.  

"There are policy violations, but they are more likely when there is low RA visibility or during breaks from classes.  Programs and events help keep students motivated and out of trouble," she said.

Headline: Attraction linked to pheromones
Subheadline: Explicit Content...a sex and relationship column
Author: Dana A. Gruber
&nbsp;
Have you ever felt "fireworks" when meeting someone you find attractive? Getting the "butterflies" or a chill down your spine may not just be a reaction to your perception of someone's physical qualities, but, according to research, it is a physiological response - a chemical reaction.

Hormones are glandular secretions which act as chemical messengers between the cells of the body. Studies have shown that the release of testosterone (the male sex hormone) in animals can trigger courtship and/or aggressive behavior. The same response may also occur in humans. This hormonal manifestation takes place within an individual, yet draws the opposite (or same) sex closer.

As for men, hormones are said to be directly linked to their sexuality. The most prominent male hormone, testosterone, is secreted by the gonads; it travels throughout the body and takes effect on various bodily systems. Otherwise in healthy supply, testosterone can be negatively affected by smoking, drinking, stress, and age. The levels of this particular hormone in a healthy male are 20 to 40 times higher than in females. It's no wonder some males get so excited that they just can't help humping your leg.

Hormonal excretions of men and women differ both in concentration and in pattern. In women, there are two major sex hormones that aid in the development of a healthy libido: estrogen and progesterone. While both regulate the female cycle, estrogen stimulates the maturation of the breasts, vagina, uterus, and all connecting tunnels. It also takes part in placing the junk in our trunks. So, next time you catch a man out of the corner of your eye checking out your breasts or booty, just thank Mother Nature for your arousing gifts as he thinks about how much he'd like to unwrap them.

Not only do men get sexually stimulated when they see a fly female, but research also shows that men's testosterone levels rise every time they have a mere conversation with one of us. This is what I like to call "pussy power." Whenever a stimulating conversation ensues between two people who share an attraction, they become receptive to one another's pheromones, or the chemicals produced by a living organism that transmit a message to other members of the same species.

Human pheromones are said to be produced by the apocrine glands, which start functioning after reaching puberty. It's hypothesized that pheromone detection could contribute to people developing a sexual attraction, "chemistry," or even a dislike toward each other. 

Using a brain imaging technique, a difference was discovered between how homosexual and heterosexual men respond to odors that may be involved in sexual arousal, and that gay men react in the same way as women. Research has a long way to go to get to the bottom of what truly attracts one person to another, but human pheromones seem to be the biological bottom-line for sexual orientation and sexual arousal. So, next time you bump into a fine specimen, just take a deep breath and see what happens.

Subheadline: Wolfsonian showcases ongoing exhibits, reveals new offerings
Author: Maria Chercoles / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Wolfsonian museum, located in Miami Beach, operates as a university art museum through Florida International University.  However, not many students take advantage of the cultural benefits the Wolfsonian offers, which are free to FIU students.

"We would like students to get more involved, to know that this is part of their campus, too," said Wolfsonian Communications Manager Julieth Dabdoub. "We work with the faculty at the academic level to have exhibitions that relate to classes offered at FIU."

The Wolfsonian was founded in 1986 to exhibit the Mitchell Wolfson Jr. Collection. In 1997, both the collection and building were donated to the state, and the Wolfsonian became a department of FIU. Since then, the museum has received funding from different sources. 

"Besides the state loan we receive through FIU, we receive funding from corporate sponsors, from different foundations, and from individuals," explained Associate Director for Development Jeffrey Fischer. 

Since 1996, the museum has been showing Art and Design in the Moderne Age, an ongoing exhibition of 300 works providing an insight of the Wolfsonian collection, which is comprised of more than 100,000 objects from 1885 to 1945. The exhibition explores the different focal points of the Wolfsonian collection by showing works of design-reform movements, architecture, urbanism, industrial design, transportation, world's fairs, advertising and political propaganda. 

Besides its ongoing installation, the Wolfsonian also has a full schedule of exhibitions, public talks, movies and other events.

"We try to choose exhibitions that complement what we have and that will be of interest to students. We also consider which FIU departments would find them useful," said Assistant Curator Sarah Schleuning. "Expositions are selected by an exhibition committee which reviews traveling exhibitions. We also receive proposals from FIU professors who might have seen certain exhibitions somewhere else," she added.

Modernism in American Silver: 20th- Century Design, will open on Nov. 10. This exhibition has more than 300 works of silver, representing different periods in American design, and the different economic and cultural factors which shaped these periods. There are works from the 1920s Art Moderne, the 1930s machine age streamlining and modern classicism, the mid-century free form and the late ultramodern.   

"Another big thing when selecting an exhibition is timing," explained Schleuning. "Sometimes we have certain open months between exhibitions, limiting us to exhibitions that will be available during that particular period." 

The museum also hosts public talks. On Sept. 21, the museum will hold "Cuban Elegance: the Colonial Era to the Mid-Twentieth Century," by Michael Connors, who will discuss how architecture and interior fashions took shape and mixed into the social, economic and political trends in Cuba. 

Other public talks to take place this fall include "Surveillance Means Security: Remixed War Propaganda," and "Go Native!: Ideas to Make your Garden a Natural Habitat." 

A book club is held the first Friday of each month, which discusses literary works relating to the museum's exhibitions and collection themes either in the historical, social or political context. Some of the books that will be discussed this fall include The Fig Eater by Jody Shields and The Blithedale Romance by Nathaniel Hawthorne. 

This fall, the Wolfsonian will also start its Cine-Book Club series, a showing of movies based on the works discussed in the book club. Movies scheduled include "The Loved One," based on Evelyn Waugh's novel of the same title, showing on Sept. 8, and "Christ Stopped at Eboli", based on Carlo Levi's novel also with the same title, which will show on Dec. 15.

 The Wolfsonian Museum is located on 1001 Washington Avenue, Miami Beach. It opens from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday through Tuesday, and from 12 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays. It is closed on Wednesdays.

 Admission is $7 for adults and free for students. Free guided visits are given on Fridays at 6pm. Discounted parking (with validation) is available at 1041 Collins Avenue.

Headline: A Day in the Life: A North Miami student at BBC
Author: Agustina Prigoshin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As isolated as BBC may seem, nearby North Miami, Aventura and Hollywood offer a plethora of activities and places to hang out from dawn until late into the night.



Nature:
If waking up early and exercising before class seems ideal, check out Oleta State Park and Haulover Park Beach just around the corner.

Oleta State Park offers Biscayne Bay a view of its natural attractions and a variety of recreational activities. 

For adrenaline junkies, trails for mountain biking snake through Oleta's forest and are labeled to indicate which trail goes which way.

Or if a nature walk sounds better, Oleta's nature trails offer hiking through the forest paralleling mountain bike trails, the swamp, passing through the picnic areas and the beach.  One of the trails even leads to a butterfly farm.

Kayak rentals in the park allow for a scenic and relaxing time while twisting and turning through swamp bends.



Beaches:
Haulover Park Beach sits between the Atlantic Ocean and the northern tip of Biscayne Bay.

On the Atlantic coast, there's a 1.5-mile boardwalk for running, skating and biking or just walking. The boardwalk's lighted all night except from early April until the end of October when the lights are turned off to provide privacy to sea turtles that come ashore to lay their eggs

Across Collins Avenue, on the Biscayne Bay side, is the Haulover marina where kayaks and canoes can be rented. The marina area also offers six lighted tennis courts and a nine-hole golf course.



Cuisine:
If the mood calls for an Asian or Pacific cuisine, Hiro's is nearby and inexpensive. 

Stop by for one of their lunch specials and savor their fresh seafood while listening to the latest hits over the speakers and admiring their chic murals.

Hiro's is almost always busy, and although the service may be frustrating at times, the food keeps customers coming back.

The North Miami Ale House is just a few blocks east of Hiro's ,has about 30 TV's and half a dozen big screens constantly playing sporting events. 

Playing pool or some of their arcade games is a good way to kill time until the food arrives.

The service is relatively good and the food consists of burgers, fries, nachos and seafood.



Night Life:
Q Restaurant and Lounge, open until 2 a.m., in Aventura's Waterway Shops offers an eclectic menu divided into four main categories: appetizers, salads, panini's and crepes. 

Q's simple yet trendy atmosphere offers both indoor and outdoor seating. 

Their full bar provides two-for-one drink happy hour from 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. 

Q hosts different events every week, including art exhibitions, Moroccan nights, Ballenato bands and DJ's spinning Techno and House music. 

Ivy Aventura Restaurant and Lounge offers indoor seating in a dimmed, romantic atmosphere or dining under the stars in their garden. 

Ivy holds happy hour everyday from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. and also hosts a different event every night.  

Nikki Marina is an entertainment complex with seating options and a Sunset Happy Hour Friday nights with two-for-one cocktail specials from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. 

Indoors seating surrounds the bars and dance floor among the flashing lights and pounding music. Outside seating surrounds the marina.

Planning on arriving by boat? The marina offers dock space where the servers take orders and deliver food to the yachts.

Guest DJ's spin all types of music: House, Trance, Hip Hop and R&B on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. 

Of course, there's much more to do and eat within easy range of BBC. But this brief sample is a good start for off-campus adventures.

Headline: Wireless access set up at WUC
Author: Megan Wright / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Wolfe University Center has gone wireless to the tune of $6,157.34.  Of that amount, $3,085 came from the Student Government Association, while Campus Life paid for the services for SGA's office.  

According to Camilo Silva, SGA president, "Zack Trautenberg approached me at the end of the Spring semester with the idea to do something big for students, something more than just a give-away."

The project was spearheaded by Luis Muench, director of Web Development; the service is free and is now accessible in thirteen different areas of WUC.  

"I wanted to do something big for students with all the excess funds we had and this turned out to be rather appropriate.  To me laptops are useless without internet [access] and this allows us to be on the cutting edge," Trautenberg said. 

Services can also be accessed in two different areas of the cafeteria due to signals from areas close by.  "The cafeteria was not wired for services as it would soon be relocated, "we figured out that it would be more economical to do main areas that were permanent and there were more students and stronger signals," said Trautenberg.

 This service came in the wake of discussions by student representatives who thought going wireless, especially in WUC which was a popular place for students to study, was among the necessary infrastructures that needed to be in place to enhance student life at FIU.   

This idea was met with resistance before, but once SGA realized they had money to fund it, it was not a problem. 

The service has been operating since mid-June.

 "Students are very receptive and now hang out on the weekends and use the service," Silva said.

Computers are not required to be registered to have access, but it is encouraged that students register their device with UTS so that only people who are part of the University can have access to the network. 

This way unauthorized users will not be able to use the system and slow it down. 

According to junior Jessica Solis, part of WUC staff, "lots of people like it because there aren't all these registration restrictions in order to use it."  

The service also works with hand held devices as well as other devices with wireless internet capabilities. 

"[The service is] pretty convenient. Just hanging out and having internet access was great," Freshman Jim Palacio said.

Silva said that there are plans underway to get a Technology Fee included in the tuition so that the University can have the budget to not only get the infrastructure in place but to maintain it, since the $50,000 per year that is allocated for technology is just not enough for a university of FIU's size.

Step by step instructions for registering your device and accessing the web can be found at the UTS website at http://uts.fiu.edu and reading the directions  or at the computer lab in AC1 - 293.
