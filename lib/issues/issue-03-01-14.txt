Headline: "About Schmidt" invites thought
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Part of the fun of "About Schmidt" is the way the audience is so quick to sympathize and connect with a character that should be completely despicable. Every hateful and negative act that Warren Schmidt commits is done with such a slight twinge of irony, there's no way not to excuse him. Eventually, you're just left understanding him, despite his many flaws. Warren's mindset starts to seem logical, no matter how cold and absurd it may be. Warren Schmidt isn't the character we love to hate; he's the character we hate to admit we love.

Without ever being saccharine or contrived, "About Schmidt" is able to ask a character "what did you do with your life?" and get a very real answer. Warren Schmidt is a retired insurance company man without any kind of connection to other people. His best friend, his wife, his daughter are all distant strangers that he just happens to interact with on a regular basis. Caught in the proverbial retirement slump, Warren tries to do his best to continue forward with life, despite the fact that he's suddenly realizing he never had any forward direction to begin with. After a few minor breakdowns and the death of his wife, he finds himself caught on the road in a gigantic Winnebago to see the US, come to terms with his life and get from Omaha to Denver so he can attend his slightly estranged daughter's wedding to a "nincompoop."

Jack Nicholson manages to do the unthinkable in this movie; his Warren Schmidt is almost completely devoid of what we've come to expect out of Nicholson. Gone is the snarky grin, the randy old bastard we've come to expect from his later works. Also absent is the dangerous rebel, a man battling with his own demons as well as others', like his early roles. Instead, we have a new Nicholson: a harmless old codger wallowing in his own pathetic-ness.

A large portion of the movie is devoted to voice-over, which avoids being hamhanded because of what he's able to reveal about himself without realizing it. In Schmidt's case, his inaction speaks louder than his words. The audience realizes what type of an asshole Schmidt can be, but no one else does because he keeps it so bottled up most of the time. But this is a man who tries desperately to stop his daughter from marrying her fianc√© just because of his superficial knowledge of the man. 

Don't be confused however, and think that "About Schmidt" is a depressing character drama for which Nicholson got to stretch his acting muscles hoping for an Oscar nod. In fact, "About Schmidt" is probably one of the darkest comedies I've ever sat through. 

So dark in fact, I'm still debating with myself as to where exactly the comedy lies. There are funny moments, but the ones that actually make you laugh seem completely out of place, as if a silly road-trip comedy script got caught in the copy machine with the script for "About Schmidt" and you get left with flat jokes salvaged by Nicholson's excellent comic timing. The only time during "About Schmidt" that my laughter shouldn't have been the awkward kind was every time Warren said "Dear Ngudu."

"About Schmidt" is more flawed than a lot of critics are willing to admit. But that doesn't take from the fact that it's one of the more thought provoking works of cinema to come out in a while. 

If you walk out of a movie  thinking, you've got something very few films offer: an emotional and intellectual connection. Warren Schmidt could've used his own film.

Headline: "Nicholas Nickleby" revisits Dickens classic
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
Thanks to amusing British actors, the latest incarnation of Charles Dickens' third novel, "The Life and the Adventures of Nicholas Nickelby," is lively and entertaining. The film, "Nicholas Nickelby," is set in 19th-century England where Nicholas Nickelby, played by Charlie Hunnam, and his family reside. The Nickelbys live in comfort until Nicholas' father dies, leaving the family penniless due to some bad investments. 

Nicholas suddenly becomes the leader of the family. Only having each other to depend upon, Nicholas, his mother and his sister set off to London to live with their wealthy but vindictive Uncle Ralph (Christopher Plummer), who deliberately keeps the three apart. Uncle Ralph is almost too good at playing Mr. Bad Guy in his role of humorous scoundrel and intimidating uncle. His performance is definitely prize-winning. 

Nicholas is sent off to work as a teacher at a boys' boarding school, where he looks forward to finding a meaningful job. Instead, he is faced with a cruel headmaster named Wackford Squeers (Jim Broadbent), who does nothing but mistreat the orphans. 

Nicholas befriends one student, Smike (Jamie Bell), who is probably picked on the most. The duo eventually escape Squeers' fury and they conspire a way to get Nicholas' family back together. So begins Nicholas' journey with the crippled Smike.  Bell's role as Smike is, without a doubt, one of the more complex parts to play, for his role is sad and tragic. His performance is superb nonetheless.

During their adventure, we meet lots of side characters, some of them only briefly onscreen. Nathan Lane has a cameo as the "traveling theatrical troupe." Not surprisingly, Lane adds wit and hilarity to the movie.

With an incredible amount of comedy, the characters work extremely well together and it is especially noticeable that a new talented actor, Hunnam, is born during this film. After this performance, it is obvious that we'll be seeing a lot more of Hunnam in the future. The director, Douglas McGrath, truly presents Dickens' novel as it should be presented, as he did a few years ago with Jane Austin's "Emma." Here, he depicts the Dickens theme in a bright light rather than the way Dickens originally presented the heavy subject matter: gloomy orphanages and brutal characters. McGrath uses those sour points and turns them into positive and fun laughs; not something Dickens was particularly good at. Striking me as amazing is the fact that McGrath is able to present this tragic theme in a positive light without losing the sometimes aweful power of Dickens' novel.

It is clear that McGrath utilizes his own energy to create the enthusiasm needed for this film and it is so well done that the 132 minutes seem to end more quickly than the length of the previews. But it seems like McGrath abridges Dickens' ideas too much. 

Overall, it's a good movie. McGrath does a good job at appealing to diverse crowds, particularly young girls. Why else would we see so much of Hunnam's shirtless body? I don't really think Dickens intended to create such sexy characters in his work but hey, if gets the kids reading, why not?

Headline: Twain returns with clever marketing ploy
Author: Adriana Pereira
&nbsp;
In 1997, when her mega-selling album Come On Over came out, Shania Twain surprised not only the country world, but the entire music industry as she added a twist to country music.  She became known as a "pop-country" artist and went on to win numerous awards with what was the best-selling country album of all time.   

After much relaxing and regrouping in Switzerland, Twain and her husband, producer Robert "Mutt" Lange, not only came back with a 16-month-old baby son, but also an album which they co-wrote. After two years, the country girl known for giving country music a twist of her own is back and doing it again.  Shania Twain just released her new album UP!, which consists of 19 tracks set in three different mixes, a red CD, a green CD and a blue CD, each with a distinct sound.

The album's diversity caters to various tastes.  The red CD offers a more modern listen, with a touch of electric sounds and a little rock here and there. It defines the pop side in Twain. The green CD hits closer to the country home as it delivers a more acoustic and Southern sound, bringing out the good ole' country in Twain. The blue CD is a rhythmic ensemble of Eastern sounds inspired by Twain's various visits around Europe and Asia. Keep in mind that the three CDs include the same 19 tracks, however, each conveys them in its own unique way.

The album manages to break the barriers of country music once again, but this time in a way geared towards more corners of the music spectrum.  The album includes a little bit of everything, targeting the various types of audiences. It definitely reflects individuality and the various musical roots.  

The lyrics are as Shania as can be, still funny and speaking of love, without leaving behind her female confidence and one of a kind attitude. This time she is letting everyone know that it is ok to be sexy, sultry and hip even after a baby, stretch marks and her 37th birthday.  

The album's first single "I'm Gonna Getcha Good" shares similarities with the sounds of her previous album Come On Over at first, however after a few seconds it develops into a distinct sound somewhere in between a country song and a pop-rock hit. In all three CDs it has a catchy tune, like most singles, one of those that gets stuck in your head the entire day.  "UP!," the title track, is a laid back song about those days that everyone has, when things just go wrong. Twain's advice: there is no way but "UP."  Another catchy tune is "C'est La Vie" (That's Life) which serves as a little reality check.  

A Shania Twain album would not be complete without a love song, or maybe more than one.  UP! is definitely saturated with love ballads; however, they don't all just sit still. 

These love songs are a little more upbeat than usual and who better than a husband and wife to co-write them. They offer a good taste of what love is really about. 

"It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing" describes the well-known feeling of losing the one you love; however, the feeling is described a little more subtly and in a not so clich√© way.    

The fact that the album is geared towards a more dynamic audience of various ages and nationalities works in both a positive and negative manner. 

The album is best-suited for those who are open to change and willing to expand their musical horizons.  Those who are stubborn and like to stick to the usual may not warm up to its eclectic mix.  

Coming from Shania Twain, something totally different was expected, but she has undoubtedly taken a fresh approach to the art of album making. Three mixes of the same 19 tracks may be a little too unusual for some, but I think for others it will be a welcome addition to their collection. 

So get your copy of Shania Twain's new CD. It is sure to cater to your listening needs.

Dear Hatzel Vela:

I am repulsed by what Mello has done to one of our most succesful teams winning championships in division II and building on that in division I.  I want to write an article protesting this move by our Athletic Director.  In the coming years with the faltering economies of Argentina and Brazil, Miami will be a gateway for these talented student-athletes which will go to schools such as Virginia and Clemson which are power houses in NCAA Soccer.  The sad thing is that FIU will have let this happen because they could not administer their finances.  The University of Miami does not have a soccer team and FIU could use this to bring top international students.

Please contact me if you have someone from your staff working on this, or if I could be of any assitance.

Please contact me at 305-975-1775.

Best regards,

Headline: Governor strikes blow against capital punishment in Illinois
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Anthony Porter stood 48 hours from execution. 

Before he was to face the death penalty, he was exonerated through the efforts of Northwestern University professor Dave Protess and his journalism students. 

That set off a series of investigations that would make Illinois Governor George Ryan think twice about the death penalty.

This past Saturday, two days before the end of his term, lame-duck Gov. Ryan, commuted sentences on all 167 death row inmates in the state of Illinois, pardoning four.

It was a move that was long overdue.

It goes without saying that the American justice system is flawed. Anyone that tuned into the O.J. Simpson trial can tell you that. 

If you think he was guilty, then the lesson learned is that with a team of high-dollar, power attorneys anyone can dodge a double murder conviction, regardless of guilt. If you believe O.J. was innocent, then the lesson learned is that it took a team of high-dollar, power attorneys to keep an innocent man out of jail. Either way, it clearly -  even obscenely - exposed the sway that celebrity and money held on justice. 

The investigations brought some equally disheartening facts to light. 

Since 1977, when Illinois resumed executions, the state exonerated 13 inmates and executed 12. The system had wrongly convicted more men than it had managed to execute. 

To further the embarrassment, the studies had found that you were five times more likely to face execution in Illinois' rural areas as you would in the Chicago area.

That juries were three-and-a-half times more likely to impose a death sentence when a victim was white as opposed to black.

Thirty-three of the 167 inmates had been defended by attorneys who, later, had been either disbarred or suspended. 

Of the 167 inmates, 35 African Americans - blacks represented two-thirds of the 167 - had been convicted and sentenced to death by all-white juries. 

The four inmates who were given full pardons were granted those pardons because their "confessions" came after a series of beatings, a pattern of police brutality that, under the weight of investigations by internal affairs officers, ultimately cost Chicago police commander Jon Burge his job.

All of that reeks of injustice, an injustice that is entirely incompatible with a punishment as severe and final as execution.

The United States lags behind many of the nations we are supposed to set an example for. The whole of the European Union has abolished execution. 

In fact, 12 U.S. states have abolished execution as a form of punishment. 

Still, the majority of the union adheres to this barbaric, atavistic, Hammurabian code.

"What an amazing coincidence that he holds this nugget in his pocket until the last moment," Kevin W. Lyons, Peoria County State's attorney said. "Why would he do that?" 

And that might be one of the saddest facts in this whole matter. The majority of public sentiment, like the majority of U.S. states, is pro-capital punishment. 

The blow that Gov. Ryan held out on until the last possible moment to strike, despite the obvious moral obligation, may well have been political suicide.

Headline: Editor goes broke, needs help
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
I'm broke, unbearably broke; I open my wallet and mutated spiders scuttle away from the piercing light of day.

My car slumps on the sidewalk outside my house, useless, comatose, baking in the heat because I don't have the $500 I need to bring it back from its deathly slumber.

I've come to school on a bus I shared with little old ladies who know the bus route with sickening exactitude and chatter about their collective catalogue of illnesses. What's even worse, I haggled with the bus driver because I wasn't carrying the requisite $1.25. I was five cents short, and the most detailed examination of my pockets proved a waste of Mr. Bus Driver's time. He finally, mercifully, snorted me into a humble seat at the back of the bus.

I'm at the school bookstore now, staring at the back of books in complete and utter disbelief, if you'll allow the redundancy. I'm expected to pay $88 for a 120 page book, $55 for an 800 page book, and $110 for an imposing textbook that I'll never use; lifting it has been know to cripple at least two FIU football players.

What's worse, what really seems to fly in the face of all we know is holy and good, is that these three books combined are almost as expensive as the class they're for.

I simply can't afford it. I have to resort to that most vile of human activities: I check out the books from the public library, with the unspoken but inevitable intention of forever marring their pages with my trusty hi-liter.

So we're back to that unbearable brokeness.

I can hear you grumble: "Why not get a job, you lazy, Commie bum?"

That would, of course, make sense. The thing is, I already do have two of those; the odd twist is that I only get paid for one of them, and that amounts to, I don't know, half what a regular part-time job would be. 

You see, these so-called jobs involve "writing," which is generally considered one of the world's most unprofitable occupations, right up there with selling lemonade by the side of the road.

For the next two weeks, I must rely on about 75 cents. I pretty much can't afford to go on living. Like George Bailey in "It's a Wonderful Life," I'm worth more dead.

That's why I've decided to commit suicide. 

My newspaper columns will attain cult status, and seen, belatedly, as the tortured ramblings of an illuminated soul, a martyred poet combining the self-deprecating, gloomy wit of Kurt Cobain and the self-deluded, embarrassing "wit" of Courtney Love.

But here's the catch: by the reading of this column, you, (yes, I do mean YOU) have legally become my accomplice. You now know my intention, and what happens next lies entirely in your hands.

You can send a dollar in care of Hansel Castro, at University Park, GC 210, Miami, Fl. 33199; you'll barely notice it's gone, and I can continue providing you with amusing, not-at-all serious columns. Or you can turn away, like a cold, murderous bastard, condemning both me and you to the fiery flames (are there any other kind of flames?) of Hell...

You're not a cold, murderous bastard, are you? Are you going to let a miserable little dollar get in the way of your Eternal Salvation?

I thought not. I hope to hear from you soon.

Headline: University needs to offer more night-time classes
Author: Lissette Asencio
&nbsp;
There is one thing that makes me shake my head in disappointment every time I go to register.

"Insufficient night classes available" is the phrase that echoes in my mind as I type faster and faster on the registration website, trying to find the few classes that are held after work hours, without much luck. 

It gives me a headache trying to find a night class that does not have a prerequisite, does not need special permission from the instructor and oh, yes, has not been filled by the hundreds of other students who have registered before my registration date. 

It is a dilemma that sometimes keeps me on the website for hours. 

Though it is true that there are various classes held after 5 p.m. that do not have these problems, those classes are not always the classes I  need. 

They are usually classes that I can put off taking for a few semesters and maybe come back to later. When I really need to take a certain class, I find it at a time that is incompatible with my work schedule, if it is actually being offered that semester at all. 

Usually the classes are about 9:30 a.m. to 10:45 a.m. or maybe even three-hour classes during the morning that would end at a time that ultimately would make it impossible to return to my job and actually work a significant amount of time.

Therefore, I have had to work as a part-time employee for the three years I have been at FIU in order to attend my classes.

You might say to yourself, "Well, that isn't too bad." But it is a dilemma that ultimately depletes you of the very things that sustain you. 

Due to having to work part-time, you may lose most, if not all, of your benefits at work. 

This means insurance is now a problem. Also, your pay (which may be the only thing that allows you to continue going to school) is cut significantly because of the obvious - you are not there. You are at school, trying to find a parking space in the overcrowded parking lot or trying to buy your books at the bookstore, stuck in the long line of students also trying to purchase their books. 

Or maybe you are standing in line in the parking garage, trying to get your decal so that campus police do not give you a ticket. Or maybe you are doing just the normal, everyday thing - attending class.

The bottom line is this: FIU should try to offer more night classes so that the school might be less crowded during the day and also allow working students the option of taking more classes at night, instead of waiting for semesters to pass so they can find their class, finally, at night and then graduate. 

So if there were one thing I would change about FIU, it would be the times classes are offered. 

It is sad to see students lag behind or simply not graduate, because they cannot get the classes they need. It discourages students, who probably already have a difficult enough time going to a university, and I have seen many students eventually just drop out. "It's too hard," they tell me and I believe it.

Headline: FIU improvements pay off
Author: by Steve Perhla/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It was almost five years ago, in June of '98, and I was a freshman visiting FIU's University Park campus for the first time. There wasn't really anything spectacular enough that would attract a prospective student to attend. 

Problems included a lack of dorms, a lack of a football team, limited parking and construction delays, just to name a few. 

These problems, tangled with many others, made FIU a somewhat undesirable university for newcomers.

To add to the school's woes, FIU lacked on-campus fraternity and sorority houses, which was enough to make me reconsider attending. I had never heard of an off-campus fraternity house until I came to FIU.

 To fuel the fire, we had a football stadium that was basically there to host high school football games and not our own team. 

Despite all the missing pieces, I chose to attend FIU and did so for three years. However, with a scarcity of dorm life and without Saturday football games to attend, FIU lacked a real college atmosphere, to say the least. 

Parking was impossible and driving back and forth to north campus to serve my major was eating away my days. 

Miami's primary public university was in desperate need of some change.

I needed to have my own place and get a taste of college life the way it is supposed to be. 

So I decided to transfer to FSU and after a brief stint there to satisfy my need to get out of Miami for a while, I returned back home to FIU.

Upon my return, I noticed something that really caught my eye - a blossoming, vastly improved FIU campus. To be honest, I almost didn't recognize it. 

There were dorms towering the south side of campus. There was a second parking garage. 

There were new buildings appearing left and right. I even noticed an on-campus fraternity house, signaling more to come. 

Months later, a football team surfaced and the stadium was renovated into a respectable home venue, with blue end zones and the school logo planted at the center of the field. Expanded seating turned the old Friday night high school headquarters into FIU's own Saturday hot spot.

The first football game, which sold out, finally gave us an opportunity to gather outside the stadium on a Thursday night for a primetime tailgate party. 

Enthusiastic students all over campus showcased school colors and apparel. 

Furthermore, the addition of dorms finally gave students a chance to get away from home and live an on-campus life. 

And the expansion of the second parking garage freed up a lot of space and eased parking for those of us traveling to campus by car.

All these changes, among numerous others, have finally turned FIU into a prime player as far as major state universities are concerned. Everyday, FIU is looking like a more desirable attraction to newcomers. 

The freshmen today have twice the facilities that were available to me only five years ago and the school is not even close to being done in its improvement efforts.

I can finally say now that all the days filled with construction and dull school attitude are gone. 

After fixing up the main campus, spirits are up and FIU has established itself as a great place to attend college, and now there's no reason why anyone wouldn't want to become a Golden Panther.

 Finally, things are looking up for FIU.

Headline: Millionaire shines light on immorality
Author: Jane Eisner/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
By Jane Eisner

Knight Ridder Tribune



It's so easy to make fun of ``Joe Millionaire,'' the latest Fox TV reality show, that I almost feel guilty doing so.

Almost.

The premise alone - that a tall, handsome and somewhat goofy construction worker earning $19,000 a year can pretend to be a dashing millionaire in search of a wife - is fodder enough for a good laugh.

That 20 ostensibly bright women would quit their jobs as bankers, flight attendants or personal assistants to participate in a televised meat market is equally preposterous. Even if they do get to hang out in a French chateau. 

The guy doesn't know his fork lift from his foie gras. He's gonna pull off this prime-time Pygmalion? Does he really believe one special "girl" - they are not called women on this show - is going to look past the butler and the jewels and the promise of a lifetime of wealth to see him for who he really is? 

And when she finds out, that she's still going to want him? 

Like I said, it's too easy. 

It will be harder to persuade you that this show, which made its debut Monday and will continue for six weekly installments, is a modern-day morality play, a test of virtue not only of the girls and their guy, but also of viewers who, like me, are silly or curious enough to tune in. 

"Joe Millionaire" and other reality shows are not about reality at all. Instead they present a massaged, manipulated, stage-managed "story" with the underlying purpose of making the rest of us feel good about our values and choices in life. 

"Viewers are watching a moral spectacle of the wrong kind of relationship to feel better about themselves, as confirmation of their own good choices," says Timothy Butler, a historian at Swarthmore College. "They're saying, 'At least my life isn't as shallow, materialistic and crass as these people.' You laugh at the characters, not with them." 

"Joe Millionaire" is awfully misogynist, and no doubt some men are watching this just to see conniving women get their comeuppance as, one by one, they are summarily dismissed from the chateau, or when the "winner" eventually is told the truth. Not only are these women set up to compete fiercely for this not-so-average Joe and his alleged fortune; they also are forced to fight each other for crumbs along the way. 

There are, for example, only 20 gowns for the 20 women to wear to the first evening ball, and the scramble to capture the best one makes the fitting room during a sale at Loehmann's look like a garden tea party.

But we can't deny that there's some truth in this unappealing representation. Ever since Jane Austen penned "Pride and Prejudice" - and probably long before - grasping women have schemed to bring a rich man to the altar.

"It is a truth universally acknowledged," Austen famously wrote nearly two centuries ago, "that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife."

And if today's televised spectacle portrays the worst aspects of feminine backbiting and cat-fighting, it doesn't show men in such a good light, either. Evan Marriott, the Virginia construction worker who exchanged a flannel shirt for a tuxedo and a horse, is a fake from the top of his curly hair to the bottom of his boots. 

His dawning consciousness about the fraud he is perpetrating is equally pathetic. "As I rode off, I realized I had just started the biggest lie of my life," he laments. 

Pass me the tissues.

That said, how many men today aren't tempted to lie or exaggerate to get a girl? How many women - even in this liberated age - don't secretly wish a rich Prince Charming would sweep them away? There's a reason Cinderella tales are subject to continual remakes. They may be politically incorrect, but they sure do resonate.

Human beings have been pondering the nature of love since Socrates held his symposium nearly 2,500 years ago. We expect that Fox TV is going to figure it out? Now that's worth a laugh.

Adolfo Henriques, an FIU alumnus and president of Union Planters Bank of Florida, was elected as chair of the new FIU Board of Trustees yesterday at its first meeting.

"I am very honored and privileged to be serving in this capacity and really look forward to working with all of you to continue to help in the progress and the excellence of Florida International University," Henriques said.

David Parker, managing partner of the venture capital firm Interprise Technology Partners and member of the FIU Foundation Board of Trustees, was elected as vice-chair.  Parker was unable to attend the meeting because it was scheduled on short notice, but he was present on the phone.

"We are blessed with a Board of Trustees committee full of people who are very busy and yet continue to be committed to the excellence and success of this institution," Henriques said.

President Modesto Maidique welcomed the three new board members: Claudia Puig, vice president and general manager of Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation; Sergio Pino, president and CEO of Century Homebuilders LLC; and Howard Rock, chairman of the FIU Faculty Senate and professor of history.

These trustees were appointed to replace three former Board members - Chairman Armando Codina, Vice Chairman Paul Cejas and Alvah Chapman - who did not want to be considered for appointment to the new Board.  

The new Board of Trustees was formed following the passage of the Graham Amendment last November.  The Graham Amendment calls for a restructuring of the state university governing system, implementing a statewide Board of Governors with central control over each university's local Board of Trustees.  

In October, the former FIU Board of Trustees issued a formal opposition to the Graham Amendment. They stated lack of responsiveness, unfamiliarity with local needs and favoritism as concerns they held about the Board of Governors.  

Since then, their view has changed but Maidique remains somewhat skeptical.

In reference to the Board of Governors, Maidique said, "so far they are aiding [the Board of Trustees]. This board has more power than the previous board. But ask me a year from now and I may have a different answer."

"I think the new board is going to be supportive of independence of the individual boards," Henriques said.  

As the new chair, Henriques hopes to help make FIU a better place overall, particularly focusing on growth and funding.

"My primary objective is to continue to move toward equity in funding for this university," he said.  "We need to keep the momentum we have."

Headline: Freedom Jam kicks off MLK celebration
Author: By Giannina Vasquez/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Freedom Jam, a party kicking off the now ongoing Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration, was held at Gracie's Grill last Thursday night. It was co-sponsored by members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.
"I think the African-American community is more than glad to remember Martin Luther King, and I think the party is a great opportunity for students to get to know each other and have fun," freshman Tana Mitchell said.
Multicultural Program And Services is in charge of overseeing the events that will take place this week during the event. Director Janice Givens said the Freedom Jam is more than just part of a commemorative celebration; it was meant to serve another purpose as well.
"We initially wanted to get to the point where it could be a part of a scholarship drive, so we are doing a raffle tonight where students can buy a ticket for a dollar, and what we will do is give them half of the pot and the other half will go to the MLK scholarship fund," Givens said. "Eventually that will grow."
The Freedom Jam was interrupted by a moment of silent meditation.
Senior Camyle Haywood enjoyed the event.  "I think the party is great because it promotes unity among students," she said.  "We all know about Dr. King. He was a great man who deserves to be remembered.  I also think it is part of the college life to be involved in the different cultural activities so I will definitely attend the other commemorative celebrations."
Also as part of the MLK celebration, a Youth Forum and Peace Walkwill be held Wednesday, Jan. 15 at 9 a.m.in the Wolfe University Center Ballroom at Biscayne Bay.
"The Dream is in Your Hands" will be the theme for the forum that will feature motivational speaker Dwayne Bryant, an FIU alumnus and founder of Inner Vision International, Inc.
Bryant has spoken at numerous public schools and colleges around the nation.
Givens expects as many as 330 Miami-Dade middle and high school students will attend the forum and walk around BBC.
The last event of the week will be the 12th Annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Commemorative Breakfast, which Givens called "the most important commemorative celebration of the week."
The breakfast will be held on Friday, Jan. 17th at 8 am. with key-note speaker Dr. Samuel Betances holding a conference on "Building positive synergy through ethnic diversity."
Dr. Betances is Professor of Sociology at the Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago. He has served as a motivational speakerformajor fortune 500 companiessuch as McDonald's and Coca-Cola USA.
According to Givens, the Student Government Association purchases two or three tables at the breakfast for students every year, and the entrance cost to everyone else attending the event is $25.  About 150 people are expected to attend.

Headline: Perkins, Zeglen replace retiring administrators
Author: By Elizabeth Ferradas/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Mark B. Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of academic affairs, announced the hiring of two new senior academic affairs officers, Dr. Kyle Perkins and Dr. Marie Zeglen, last week. 

They have been chosen to replace Dr. Judith Blucker and Dr. Dan Coleman.

Blucker, executive vice provost of academic budget and personnel will retire in March after five years at the post and 31 at FIU. Coleman, vice provost for academic affairs and planning and institutional effectiveness, a 29-year veteran of Florida's University System will retire in May after working at FIU for four years.

"Dr. Dan Coleman has done a wonderful job, and it is nice to follow someone who has done a great job," Zeglen said.

The search to replace these two began two years ago. FIU's search and screen committee, which consists of 22 faculty members, university staff and students, evaluated over 100 resumes. 

"[Originally] we only had nine candidates, so we ended the search and resumed it again this year with the help of an executive firm and an advertised nationwide search," Rosenberg said. "I am delighted with whom we have chosen because we were patient, and found two individuals who are ... full of integrity and have a wealth of experience."

  Perkins will assume the position of vice provost for budget and operations replacing Blucker. He will also be a professor for the College of Education. Perkins is currently the associate provost and vice chancellor at Southern Illinois University.  

"I think that FIU is one of the most dynamic, innovative institutions of higher learning in existence, and I am both honored and humbled with having been invited to join this winning team," Perkins said. "There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that FIU is a world-class institution now, and it will only get better.

"I was so impressed with Provost Rosenberg's long-term, strategic planning initiatives, his deep understanding of the university and the environs in which it operates, and how the university will be of further service and assistance to the local community in the years to come," he said. "I knew FIU was the place for me." 

Perkins, who has a doctorate in linguistics, has held a variety of academic administrative roles at SIU. He is also a nationally recognized expert on language testing.   

Zeglen will become vice provost for planning and institutional effectiveness replacing Coleman. She currently serves as the vice provost for planning, assessment and information resource management at Cleveland State University. Zeglen, has a doctorate in sociology and a bachelor's degree in anthropology.  

"I see [FIU] positive; I am very impressed with what it has accomplished in a mere 30 years of existence," Zeglen said. "It is very high quality, and it already has Phi Beta Kappa, which most young universities do not even have yet."

She was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa at Ohio State University. Zeglen serves as a member of the 10-person national Academic Planning Academy for the Society for College and University Planning.  

"The community is so diverse and international it really appeals to me, FIU is off to a great start, and I would really like to contribute to helping the university become even more excellent," she said.

Zeglen, who is eager to begin at FIU, is a proud supporter of our women's basketball team. 

"I played basketball myself in college and I plan to attend all the games and show my support," she said.

Headline: SPC-BBC hosts Welcome Week
Author: By Eyder Peralta/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The spring semester at the Biscayne Bay Campus kicked off last Thursday with the dueling sounds of the DJ's hip-hop spins and the live Carribbean band, Steel Explosion - all part of what SPC-BBC Spokesperson Tricia Baldeosingh called SPC's "staple event."

But the main attraction for campus crawlers was the 80 boxes of pizza given out during lunch-time.

Sophomores Chioma Iwuagwu and Raynard Morgan were passing by and decided to sit outside WUC to take in the sun and breeze. And, of course, take advantage of the music and pizza.

"The free food is what brings us here," Iwuagwu said. 

Welcome Week, an event SPC-BBC hosts at the start of every semester, is a chance for students to get to know what SPC is capable of doing, Baldeosingh said. "It also made students feel excited about being back in school."

Many of the students at the event just chanced upon it. They came in droves as classes let out and slowly trickled away, intermittently filling up the student center.  

 Senior Alicia Zaitsu and freshman Luis Nin challenged each other on the Dance, Dance Revolution, a videogame contraption that looks a little like a dance version of twister: The video game console gives you directions on where to move on the lighted control pad on the floor and the animated figures on the big screen in front of you follow your lead. The challenge is when it picks up speed.

"[This event] is a pretty cool way to welcome new students," Nin said as he scouted out the rest of the activities. 

Johne Blessed is the man behind Video Dance Productions, the company contracted by SPC-BBC to handle both the airbrush tattoos and the Dance, Dance Revolution. 

"There have really only been two students who have been really good at this," Blessed said about the dance game. "Most of the others just kinda' get the hang of it after awhile."

Freshman Tashona West was just walking by when she noticed the tattoo stand. She got two: a sunburst on her belly and another on her neck. 

Outdside WUC, tables were lined with free goodies (pencils, note pads and pens) that were also part of the celebration.

Steel Explosion, a family trio of musicians, filled the outdoor air with calypso renditions as well as personal remakes of all-too-popular tunes like the Titanic theme. 

Freddy Harris on the steal drums and his father, who goes by the stage name Tum√°, on electric guitar entertained as members of SPC-BBC gave out the pizza. 

As the crowd was small, the pizza was abundant - good news for the students who were there. Some of them even walked away with entire boxes of pizza.

The welcome celebration also included the participation of the Golden Stars, a dance troupe, who performed for the students at the event. 

For SPC-BBC the event turned out just as planned. "We had good attendance; we achieved what we set out to achieve. A lot of [students] seemed to enjoy it," Baldeosingh said.

Subheadline: Stupid acts cloud larger picture
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Every sportswriter, fan and athlete absolutely despises a week like this.
We spend a lot of time defending the character of the average person who works in sports. In a  world that sees enormous attention thrown at the bad, there is an ever-present perception that being involved in sports automatically means that the person should be posted on the FBI's most wanted list.

For the most part this isn't true. 

But then a week like this comes around - a week when sports writers around the country get the opportunity to experience the life of a Carolina Panthers beat reporter, who spends more time in a courtroom then at practice. 

This is the week that those anti-sports activists wait for and the problem is that certain athletes and coaches become involved in situations that can only be called stupid. 

The sports world knows, expects and wants the country's focus turned on them, but with that comes one big negative - everyone pays attention to your failures along with your successes.

If you know that the entire country's eyes are focused on you and you know that people will be extra critical of your actions, then wouldn't you go out of your way to make sure you stay out of trouble?

Here's a look at this week.

Nolan Richardson III resigned from his head coaching position at Tennessee State University, two weeks after being suspended for doing his best Barry Switzer impression by bringing a gun into his school's arena and allegedly threatening his assistant coach.

Richardson became involved in an argument with assistant Hosea Lewis, on Christmas night, regarding the practice time after only four players showed up. 

Richardson then went out to his car and brought a handgun into the Gentry Center. 

He then asked a second assistant, Christopher Graves, where Lewis was because "he had something for him."

The coach justified the incident by explaining that Lewis hit him with a gym bag.

"Then he said, 'Come on.' Then I said, 'OK, I'll be back,'" Richardson wrote in his statement to police. 

"I went to my car to get a crow bar and saw my gun there and took it. But it had no clip or anything."

Obviously, that makes everything acceptable. Everyone who gets into a fight decides to go retrieve their personal crowbar before having to settle for a deadly weapon.

This falls into that stupid category.

Then you have the most recent occurrences at Florida State University, which seems intent to rival the Miami Hurricanes of the 1980s for the distinction of most criminal football program.

Former quarterback Adrian McPherson received his arraignment date for stealing a blank check from a restaurant and then using it for a $3,500 bonus. 

Then defensive tackle Darnell Dockett earned his own felony grand theft charge for receiving unauthorized discounts on merchandise at a mall. Seems familiar. 

Sound familiar?

Peter Warrick got caught doing the same thing when he played at FSU.

Once again, stupid.

New York Giants tight end Jeremy Shockey celebrated his own fan appreciation night when he tossed a cup of water on two children in San Francisco. 

Shockey threw the cup at heckling fans and it hit two children.

It makes perfect sense to throw stuff at the people who are paying your salary.

S-t-u-p-i-d.

There were other incidents this week. 

Indiana Pacers forward Ron Artest threw an on-court temper tantrum in which he damaged $100,000 in camera equipment. San Francisco Giant and former Florida Marlins World Series hero, Livan Hernandez swung a golf club at a 65-year-old man. 

Police visited Dennis Rodman's house for the 70th time in the past six years when a woman accused him of assaulting her.

Stupid, stupid, stupid.

These actions give sports a black eye.
Studies show that these incidents don't reflect the majority of athletes and coaches. 

The percentage of criminals in professional sports is far less than that in society as a whole. An APBnews survey conducted prior to the 2000 Super Bowl showed that NFL players have fewer arrests than the general population. 

The study found that 11 percent of that year's Super Bowl participants committed crimes ranging from failure to pay a speeding ticket to assault, compared to a 23-46 percent arrest rates for adult males under 30.

I still firmly stand by my belief that the sports world contains mostly good people.

I've been involved in too many conversations with professional  and collegiate athletes and seen too many charitable activities to believe otherwise. 

I just wish that the sports world made it easier for me to support that opinion.

Headline: Men's basketball falls to Denver 71-60
Author: Daisy Fern√°ndez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers came up 11 points short when they battled the Denver Pioneers Thursday night losing 71-60. 

FIU began slowly as Denver led by six points early in the first half.
After two free throws, junior Al Harris kept the Golden Panthers in the game with 14 points and grabbing seven rebounds. He narrowed the 
Pioneer's lead by three and raised the score to 15-12. 

However, Denver succeeded in closing the first half with a 36-27 advantage. This was due in large part to the powerful drives of 5-foot-5-inch senior guard Dusty Wadlington, who pushed the ball to the other side of the court repeatedly.

"I don't think we came out with the energy, intensity and motivation we needed to lead the game," said head coach Donnie Marsh. "I feel it is my responsibility to provide them with that, so I'll take the blame."

Determined to overcome 10 first half turnovers, FIU tried to change the pace of the game in the second quarter. From a 55-34 deficit, the Golden Panthers came back with a 10-0 run eight minutes into the second half. During the run, Nikola Novakovic contributed five points.

Despite FIU's efforts, the Pioneers proved to be too much. Denver forward Carvell McAllister helped the Pioneers claim this victory with 12 points coming off the bench. 

For FIU, junior forward Euliz Baez was the leading scorer with 15 points and seven rebounds. Denver outshot FIU, posting a  56 to 42 percent 
advantage.

The Golden Panthers now stand at 6-9, 0-2 SBC . The team has 12 remaining contests before traveling to Bowling Green, Ky. for the SBC Tournament.

Before the game began, Marsh was honored for the 100th win of his career. "I am thrilled about my award," Marsh said. "It means a great deal because of the players that have played for me and the assistant coaches who have made it happen."

Senior Rodrigo Viega was unable to play because of a recurring knee trouble.

The team will next play Tuesday against New Mexico State at Golden Panther Arena.
