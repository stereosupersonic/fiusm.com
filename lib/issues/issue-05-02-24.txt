Headline: Women's basketball win caps off 13-4 home record
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The women's basketball team finished the last regular season home stand with a 73-49 win over the University of New Orleans at Pharmed Arena on Feb. 21.

Point guard Faeza Bouderra recorded her first career double-double with 11 points and 11 assists, improving FIU to 17-8 overall and 7-5 in the Sun Belt Conference.

Prior to the game, injury riddled Deniz Boz was introduced to celebrate senior day and her successful four-year tenure at FIU. 

"She gave me a lot of good advice," said Bouderra, who claimed the starting spot after Boz's injury. "She taught me to be patient and lead the team."

New Orleans' effective 2-3 zone defense kept the Golden Panthers in check, did not allow FIU to get the ball inside during the first half and kept the score tied at 20 with two minutes to go.

"They were crowding the paint and that's why we were able to get open shots [but] we just had to make shots," said Milena Tomova. Tomova was one of the few FIU players to have success from the field in the first half, knocking down three shots from long distance.

After a quick timeout by Head coach Cindy Russo, the Golden Panthers went on a 7-2 run to finish out the half leading 27-22. FIU's energy then carried over into the second half, as the Golden Panthers outscored the Privateers 46-27, en-route to a 24-point victory.

"[They were] not rebounding, not playing tough defense," said Russo about her talk with the team at halftime. "This team could score and we knew we had to do a better job on the boards and getting them to turn the ball over."

Tomova continued her shooting success in the second half, as she came out and scored five of the team's first seven points.

"That was a team that's not that good.  They don't have many wins and they play with no worries," Tomova said. "Sometimes it's hard to beat a team like that." With only two games remaining, the Golden Panthers are set for the Sun- Belt Conference Tournament starting March 5. FIU finished their home schedule with an impressive 13-4 record.

The team will cap off their season with two tough road games against Sun-Belt Conference opponents Middle-Tennessee and Western Kentucky.

Headline: Baseball extends winning streak to five
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Golden Panthers (7-3) extended their winning streak to five games in dominant fashion with a three-game sweep of La Salle (0-3) on Feb. 18-20 at University Park Stadium.

In the first game, an 18-0 rout, starting pitcher David Asher (3-0) celebrated his 22nd birthday in style. The senior pitched five scoreless innings, struck out seven, allowed five hits and walked only one batter. 

FIU's 17-hit attack was led by third baseman Nick Cadena, who went 3-for-6 with three RBIs and three runs scored, and freshman Michael Jordan, went 3-for-5 with an RBI and two runs scored.

FIU took control from the beginning by scoring six runs in the first inning, including two via Cody Jacob's third homerun of the season, without recording an out.

The Golden Panthers added another six runs in the fourth. Junior Chris Dunn came in to pinch-hit in the sixth inning and hit another two-run homerun. Dunn is the only Golden Panther, besides Jacobs, to hit a homerun this season.

"Being a pitcher, it's great getting an 18-run support," said Asher. "I didn't really feel like I had anything today [on the mound]. The guys behind me helped me out, offensively and defensively."

Lefty Chris Siebenaler pitched four innings in relief of Asher. In his first appearance of the season, the junior allowed only three hits and struck out five batters.

FIU 13 LaSalle 1

In the second game, senior Ammer Cabrera (1-1) overcame the loss at Miami with an excellent outing. The starter threw five scoreless innings, allowed only one hit, struck out six batters and walked none.

Junior Michael Lopez led the FIU offense going 2-for-4 with a double and three RBIs, but the man of the game was centerfielder Dennis Diaz. The senior broke FIU's career stolen base record with his 109th career stolen base.

The Golden Panthers again took control in the early portion of the game by scoring 10 of their 13 runs in the first three innings. 

Price took advantage of the blow-out and brought out left-handed relief pitchers Denny Hernandez and Jon Banke, each pitched an inning for their first respective appearances of the season.

Junior Frank Gonzalez allowed the Explorer's lone run of the series in the sixth inning.

"[Cabrera] threw well and it was important we get a good start out of him," said Head coach Danny Price. 

FIU 2 LaSalle 0

In the final game of the series, freshman Elih Villanueva (3-1) led the Golden Panthers with a striking performance, no pun intended. In seven innings of work, he compiled an outstanding 12 strikeouts, allowed only one hit and walked a lone batter.

FIU got on the board in the first inning off an RBI single from Lopez that scored redshirt junior Bryan Pullin from second base.

The Golden Panther added another insurance run in the fourth inning off another RBI single, this time by Jacobs.

"It feels good [to get the win]. I had my stuff and was in good command," said Villanueva. "Not much run support, but we played good team defense."

The two runs proved to be all they needed as the pitching staff dominated LaSalle hitters. In the eighth inning, Matt Rainey came in relief of Villanueva and struck out two batters. Senior Danny Hernandez took the mound in the ninth inning and also struck out two to earn his second save of the season.

For the season, The Golden Panther's pitching staff has a team ERA of 1.42.

"You gotta be pleased [with the team's performance in the series]," Price said. "What I got a chance to do was to play a lot of people for the first time in a game. Some pitchers got their first outing. It was one of the things we wanted to do with the big leads."

The Golden Panthers continue their homestand this Friday at 7 p.m. with a three-game series against St. John University.

Headline: Heavy rains slow women's softball at tournament
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After a rainy weekend that cancelled much of the scheduled games at the San Diego Campbell/Cartier Classic, the FIU women's softball team was pleased to return home.

The Golden Panthers completed less than two of their six scheduled games during the weekend-long tournament, going 1-1 and snapping their seven game winning streak.

"Rain sucks!" said softball Head coach Kim Gwydir, commenting on the lack of games played during the weekend.

FIU did, however, end the drenching weekend on a high note, as the team defeated No. 19 ranked Oregon State 5-2 on Feb. 18. The contest was called after just 5 2/3 innings of play, due to persistent rain showers.

In the victory, FIU's Amanda Nealer improved her overall record to 7-2, after limiting the high-powered offense of the Beavers to just two unearned runs on two hits. Oregon State came into the game scoring 31 runs in three tournament games played prior to facing FIU.

With a four-run first inning lead, FIU never looked back. The big inning was highlighted by a three-run home run from Jennifer Powell. She forced the Beavers' pitcher Ta'Tyana McElroy from the game after only seven batters faced.

Following Powell's home run, the Golden Panthers tacked on an additional run in the inning when Lindsay Tippings doubled off the left-center field wall to bring home Marleah Stapf.

The Beavers reclaimed a run in the bottom of the first, as Vanessa Lapala drove in Mia Longfellow with an RBI double to right center following an FIU error with one out in the inning. But this was as close as Oregon State team would get.

FIU added a run in the fourth and eventually sealed the 5-2 win. 

The win improved FIU to 12-3 overall and dropped the Beavers to 6-5.

SDSU 2, FIU 0

The Golden Panthers snapped their seven-game winning streak to host San Diego State University on Feb. 17, the opening day of the tournament. The loss also snapped two other prominent streaks for the FIU team.

"Our flight was delayed, and we didn't get to play Thursday's game until 10 p.m. their time; no doubt in my mind that affected our play against San Diego State University," Gwydir said.

Amanda Nealer pitched four solid innings, giving up four hits, one walk and two runs, while striking out three. Limited to only two hits, the FIU offense was not able to overcome the deficit, dropping Nealer's record to 6-2. 

The loss ended Nealer's six-game winning streak as well as the Panthers' streak of 53 consecutive innings without giving up an earned run.  

FIU fell to 11-3 with the loss, while the Aztecs picked up their 10th win of the season and improved to 10-2 overall.

The Aztecs scored early, as they capitalized on the scoring opportunity in the bottom of the first inning. Following a one-out walk to Erin Mahoney, Taryin Casillas picked up an infield single. The runners then advanced to second and third on a ground out from Kristen Carranza, before Megan McDonald drove both runners home, giving SDSU a 2-0 lead.

"We should've made the play and shouldn't have given up the two runs. But Amanda is a lefty and it was a difficult play to make, as she had, [to] cross over to get to the ball," Gwydir said.

From there the Golden Panthers had little chances to score. Their best opportunity came in the fourth inning when Brook Ruiz led off the inning with a walk. She was eventually stranded at third when Tabitha Embry struck out to end the inning.

The unfavorable weather prevented the Golden Panthers from winning their third consecutive tournament and forced the cancellation of games against top-notch opponents. 

The cancelled contests included No. 13 Georgia, Santa Clara, No. 18 Fresno State and No. 3 UCLA.

This weekend FIU hosts Connecticut, Florida A&M and UCF at the Golden Panther Adidas Invitational. On Feb. 26, the Golden Panthers take on the Huskies and the Golden Knights  at 4 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., respectively, followed by the Rattlers at 1:30 p.m. on Feb. 26.

Headline: Men's basketball wraps up season road schedule
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's basketball team went on the road to Alabama to close out their season road schedule and came back with their first conference winning streak of the season. 

The Golden Panthers, who have won three of their last five conference games, following a seven-game losing streak, beat Alabama 71-74 in front of 3,087 fans on Feb. 19.

Ivan Almonte once again led the way for FIU, notching his 12th double-double of the year. The junior played the entire 40 minutes of the game and finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds.

Ismael N'Diaye and Junior Matias joined Almonte in double figures for Head coach Sergio Rouco with 18 and 16 points, respectively. 

Jayce Lewis played all 40 minutes at the point guard position as freshmen starter Antonio Jones was out with a deep thigh bruise. 

Following the win, Rouco was proud of his team's performance. 

"I'm so proud of this team tonight, because everyone contributed against a USA team that had won its last two Sun Belt Conference games. But we came into their place and beat them tonight," said Rouco.

The win was the Golden Panthers first road conference win since beating South Alabama in February of last season. 

FIU trailed by one, 71-70, with less than 30 seconds to play, but N'Diaye got an offensive rebound and was fouled. He converted the two free throw attempts to put the visitors up by one. 

On the following possession, Matias picked up the pressure and forced a South Alabama turnover. He was then fouled and converted two free throws to seal the three-point win.

"Ismael and Junior have been so clutch for us the entire season,"  Rouco said. "We showed a lot of maturity tonight. We're not going to roll over, and we're not going to make excuses when players can't play because they're hurt. We've got a lot of guys hurt, but they've got to learn how to play through the pain."

The Golden Panthers once again out-rebounded the opposition 34-26 and limited the Jaguars to just 42 percent shooting from the field. Despite converting 11 three-point attempts, the host Jaguars fell short. 



NEW ORLEANS 69 FIU 55 



FIU's two-game winning streak came to a hold on Feb. 21 as the Golden Panthers were held in their final road game of the season. 

Rouco's men shot a dismal 33.9 percent from the field and fell to hosts New Orleans by 14, 69-55. 

Despite Ivan Almonte's 21 points, FIU could not get passed poor shooting from Ismael N'Diaye and Junior Matias. The duo shot a combined 5-of-23 from the field and 2-of-11 from behind the arc, managing just 18 points. 

"We just didn't hit our shots, and when that happens you are not going to win games at this level," Rouco said. "We were our own worst enemy tonight. The defense was there and we only had (a season low) 10 turnovers, but they're a good basketball team. Give them credit."

FIU played their UNO well, limiting leading conference scorer, Bo McCalebb, to just 14 points, 11 short of his season average. 

The shooter, who is third in the nation in scoring, averages just short of 24 points per game and had a streak of 15 games with at least 20 points snapped in the win. 

The Golden Panthers, who were once again without freshman guard Antonio Jones, could not stop Chad Barnes as he connected for a career-high 23 points off the bench as the hosts won in front of 1,423 fans. 

FIU dominated in the paint but was behind from the start, never managing to  find their feet as their shots fell short. The Golden Panthers trailed by eight at the half and never saw themselves back in the game. 

After the score was tied at 15 with just nine minutes to play in the first half, Barnes connected on all of three of his three-pointers in succession, and the hosts never looked back. 

The loss ended the Golden Panthers two-game winning streak and dropped them to 10-15 on the season and 3-9 in the Sun Belt Conference with two home games left to close out the season. 

With the win, New Orleans moves to 13-14 on the season and 7-6 in the conference. 

The Golden Panthers close out their schedule with match-ups at Pharmed Arena against Western Kentucky on Feb. 26 at 7.30 p.m. and Feb. 28 at 7:30 p.m. against Middle Tennessee.

Student agrees with editorial on lack of school spirit at FIU

In response to the Jan. 27 editorial, it's impossible to have school spirit at FIU. 
Until FIU finds a way to get rid of their "second-rate" image, there is no reason to feel any pride or spirit. 
Most students are here because of a lack of options, not because they truly want to be here. 
FIU is a young university with no true identity as of yet. Until it finds one, there will be no "school spirit" among its students.

Student feels current FIU football coach not up to par

If the FIU football team is serious about being a D-I A team in the future, what it needs to do is find itself a new football coach.
 Don Strock is simply not going to bring in top recruits. 
He has to compete with major coaches throughout the state of Florida such as Larry Coker (University of Miami), Bobby Bowden (Florida State), Howard Schnellenberger (Florida Atlantic) and now the popular new coach Urban Meyer (University of Florida). 
To compete with those teams, FIU needs to start making changes at the top - its head coach.

Subheadline: Proposed tuition increases in Florida universities compared to out-of-state schools
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As college students, budget cuts are of the utmost interest. No matter if you are a full-time or part-time student, budget cuts affect us all in the same way, mostly in the form of tuition increases.

For the Fall 2005 semester, tuition is expected to rise by 7.5 percent. Such an increase is not new to the FIU community and is one that could affect many students. 

During the past three years, tuition for undergraduate students has increased by an average of 16 percent.  Even though the increase will affect students' pockets in a negative way, the universities total income is expected to rise by $11 million. 

What is FIU planning to do with all that money? Will the university use that money to dig itself out of the debt hole it is currently in?

Currently, tuition for 24 credits at FIU is at $3,157 for in-state students and $15,644 for out-of-state students. 

That is approximately $100 more than tuition at Florida State University. 

According to University Treasurer Alexander Zyne, tuition at Florida universities is much less compared to other universities. 

This is true. At Ohio State University for example, in-state tuition is $7,479 and out-of-state is $18,066 for a total of 12 credits. If FIU raises its tuition prices, it sparks many questions for us students. 

Will a degree from FIU be of equal value to that of Ohio State? Will professors receive more supplies and will classrooms be renovated with modern equipment? Will tuition increase benefit the students or only the bank account of the university? 

As current students, we hope that our Return on Investment (ROI) will be greater or for the better if our tuition increases.

Headline: Bush proposes nation-wide budget cuts
Author: German Silverio / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the start of his second term in office, President Bush is now trying to get Congress to pass a set of thorough budget cuts aimed at decreasing the amount of government spending - a decision I believe is sound. 

Now that the Republican party is comfortably in control of the Senate and the House of Representatives, one would expect his proposed budget cuts to get approved without any major inconvenience, but what  appears to be going on now is a great deal of discontent from a number of Republicans (and obviously Democrats) regarding the government programs that would get hurt from these budget cuts. 

The problem is this: Under the proposed budget cuts, some 150 government programs would be somehow affected or eliminated. 

The cuts would be directed toward different programs ranging from housing and urban development (an approximate 12 percent budget cut) to education (an approximate 2 percent budget cut) - all with the intentions of reducing the amount of government spending. 

Meanwhile, there are expected budget increases for programs which are deemed more pivotal to the Bush agenda, ranging from US foreign aid (an approximate 16 percent budget increase) to the Defense Department (an approximate 4 percent budget increase).

However, it interestingly appears that one of the main reasons why many Republicans distrust the cuts is because they would also affect the agriculture sector (9 percent budget cut), a sector of the American economy heavily subsidized by the government and zealously protected by Democrats and Republicans alike. 

It seems as if President Bush's interests are not entirely aligned with the interests of his party, and as if his party is not entirely committed to fully supporting  his political agenda.

On the other hand, it is also curious to note that the major beneficiary when it comes to budget increases will not be the United States but rather, foreign countries. With a proposed increase of 16 percent in their budget, foreign aid programs should be able to do a more competent job when it comes to aiding third world countries. 

President Bush is currently trying to persuade Congress to provide a $600 million boost to aid the nations hit by the Dec. 26 tsunami (in addition to the $350 million originally pledged).

Thus, Bush's political stance seems somewhat blurry at the moment. 

It appears that the proposed budget cuts in the agriculture sector, which is criticized for being largely subsidized reflect how he is taking steps toward the dismay of his party. It's also fair to point out that in regard to the proposed increase in foreign aid, this may simply be an attempt to bolster the United State's image abroad. 

Whatever his reasons, it is certain that President Bush will have to use much of his political capital to push his agenda, for better or for worse.

Headline: The day the music died
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
You don't know what you've got until it's gone. That saying rings no truer than now as I look sadly at the car radio. It seems sadder. And why wouldn't it be? South Florida just recently had to say one last farewell to two cherished friends: Party 93.1 and ZETA 94.9.  

What on earth am I supposed to listen to now? 

It happened on Feb. 15 after ZETA gave its last breath of a song and was taken off the air. As usual, we early morning listeners tuned in to hear our favorite morning show or perhaps 93.1's insanely hyper morning adrenaline rush.  

Instead, the rhythmic stylings of Daddy Yankee as well as a large spoonful of Spanish pop greeted listeners. 

Even more in a panic were the Party 93.1 buffs, used to their usual dose of high-octave trance and techno, and instead they received a so-called "Zeta-replacement" known only as ROCK 93.1.   

Perhaps Cox Communications realized the outrage that ZETA's going off the air inspired. And is this really going to be a decent alternative for the faithful ZETA fans that have listened for almost two decades? ZETA Station Manager Michael Disney described the new programming as a "different type of rock." 

While ZETA played more progressive rock, Disney called this new rock station "active rock" - in other words, a lot of music from the 90s. 

To add insult to injury ZETA is now MEGA (WMGA), yet another cheap Power 96 knockoff playing "all 18 in row!" 

Can't the majority of us say we have had enough of Spanish radio stations in South Florida? It's unbelievable. 

There has been an explosion of reggaeton mixes on all types of music, and Oye Loca ven pa'ca is resounding through our radios and is playing in every club in town.

"It wasn't so much that there was something wrong with it," said Disney. "We had an awful lot of people who listened to the station, and they didn't listen as long as we liked."

How about trance and techno listeners? We need DJ Tiesto blasting hot beats of "Traffic" as we slowly move inch by inch down the palmetto expressway. 

Obviously, it wasn't their concern because as the website states - "Party 93.1: Where Dance Music CONTINUES to live Worldwide ... On-Line!!!"  

Unfortunately, for those who cannot afford digital radio we are left high and dry, forced to revert to the shadier ways of getting music: i.e. P2P sharing and downloading. Some of us might spend the money on the CDs. Those mixes can be pretty costly.  

It seems to me that Clear Channel Communications is underestimating the target listeners it just lost in moving towards a more profitable endeavor. 

True, most of us were skeptical when Party 93.1 came out with its somewhat dirty method of propaganda: "Last hour alone, Power played 15-18 commercials and Y-100 played 20 commercials...here at the new Party 93.1 we only played four commercials."  I admit that did annoy us for a while. 

But now, as students I say we need to take a stand and fight for our rights. These giant monopolies like Clear Channel and Cox Communications are not thinking of the listeners when they decide to change the radio station overnight. 

 "All we have in South Florida as mainstream is hip-hop and R&B. 93.1 and Zeta were different and unique; it brought variety to Miami," said junior Elena Calero. "I was surprised there was no formal announcement beforehand and that they decided to cater to the masses in such a way." 

Gary Serlin, a professor for the School of Journalism and Mass Communications offered his own opinion.

"They have so many ads already paid for with the older station. They need to hold on to their listeners," said Serlin. "That's why they wouldn't announce the radio station was about to close."  

Hispanics don't just listen to reggeaton, merengue and salsa. It sounds like music is appealing to an already full market, when the consumers want something more exciting than just the same played-out songs over and over again. I am not here to say there are no better radio stations to listen to. 

However, I do believe that if ZETA is trying to woo a certain group of young people, I am not impressed.

Headline: DISCOVER; Rowing Club
Author: Luis Nin / Illustrator
&nbsp;
At the Biscayne Bay Campus, behind Academic One and across from the gravel, granite and dust from the new School of Hospitality's construction site, sits an old boathouse. 

On certain afternoons, rowboats can be seen gracefully cutting across the water. Crews of two to eight people synchronize their large, wooden oars and glide across the bay. The people in these boats are FIU students from the Rowing Club.

The Rowing Club has been racing on the bay for 10 years. From a boathouse behind the BBC pool, Coach Syd McKay helps launch crews from a little beach on the Biscayne Bay and out onto the water. 

Born in Scotland, McKay has been rowing since he was 13 years old. He was a multiple national champion in rowing competitions throughout high school. 

With decades of experience in rowing, McKay hopes to share his love of rowing with students in sunny South Florida.

"This is Florida. There are no winters. This is an ideal sport for this part of the world. You can go out 12 months a year," said McKay. For young people this is [a] real great thing to do."

McKay also enjoys the aspect of rowing out in nature.

"It is one of the best sports out. Where else can you marry physical exertion together with being in the fresh air, being out in the water [and] enjoying the benefits [and] the goodness of nature?" McKay said. 

There are no fees required to join the Rowing Club. All students need is a pair of swimming shoes to join. Despite this, not many students take advantage of the Rowing Club's offer. 

There are 20 members on the roster, but only 12 of them actively row. The lack of members perplexes the Rowing Club. McKay believes that it should receive more attention from students.

"This is the best club on campus. We should have people from South Campus joining the club. You don't have to pay anything," said club member Shandira-Jewel Ebgecomb.

Ebgecomb enjoys the unique way of exercising through rowing and the peacefulness of the water.

"It's a movement you wouldn't normally do. It's incorporating muscles you wouldn't normally work even at the gym," Ebgecomb said. "It's calming. You can't focus on anything else while you're there."

The Rowing Club is always looking for new members. The club meets behind the BBC pool in front of the boathouse on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. For more information e-mail Coach McKay at crew@fiu.edu or call him at (305) 623-0142.

Headline: Tuition hikes set back low-income students
Author: Lynn Franey / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Jason Pratt was no math whiz in high school, but he can understand how bad the odds are for low-income students like him to graduate from college.

Just six out of 100 kids from families making less than $35,000 a year earn a bachelor's degree by the time they are 24.

In families making more than $90,000 a year, 51 out of 100 kids graduate.

As college tuition skyrockets and financial aid for low-income students stagnates, it's no surprise the gap has grown in the past 30 years.

That gap is prompting an increasing number of colleges to take action.

Some, including Pratt's school, Northwest Missouri State University, give low-income students more money for college.

Harvard University now pledges that students from families making less than $40,000 will pay nothing.

More schools have joined College Goal Sunday program, which makes college financial aid counselors available for free to students and their families to help fill out the complicated federal financial aid form.

Some are working to give disadvantaged children a vision of themselves as college material by bringing them to campus at ever-earlier ages for summer programs.

"Colleges and universities are very heavily invested in this and very anxious to do the right thing for the nation by boosting achievement," said Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education in Washington, D.C.

Nationally, colleges make more grants to low-income students than the federal and state governments combined.

The problem is that poorly performing wealthy children are as likely to go to college as the most academically talented poor children, Hartle said.

Colleges know something has to be done.

Northwest Missouri State introduced the American Dream Grant program this school year. In the first two years it pays tuition, room and board for qualified students whose families earn less than $30,000. The students must pitch in $1,500 a year and apply for other aid.

Not being from a well-off family presents many educational challenges, experts say.

Many attend inferior high schools that don't have the academic resources and strengths as better-off public or private schools.

 Many must work long hours to help their families, hurting their chances of doing well in school and on standardized tests. That, in turn, means they are less likely to earn the scholarships and grants set aside for the highest-achieving students.

 Often they are from families without much experience with higher education. That means they need extra help with college and financial aid applications and extra support once they get to college, through tutoring or help navigating the bureaucracy.

Angela Lindsey-Nunn, a 36-year-old University of Kansas student, knows the struggles of the poor to earn a bachelor's degree.

She grew up in Salina, one of four children of a single mother who emigrated from Asia. After high school she went to Marymount College, a now-closed private school in Salina.

But after a year she couldn't afford it. She left with debt that took her years to pay off.

After a divorce, Lindsey-Nunn, who has a seizure disorder, and her two children for a time lived on $400 a month.

Now, after quitting work under her doctor's orders, she has enrolled at KU. She gets disability benefits and is studying wildlife conservation.

While applauding efforts to make college more affordable and accessible, one critic of higher education says the changes aren't enough to close the gap.

President Bush wants to increase the amount of Pell Grants, the main federal aid program for poor students. But the amount of the proposed increase would do little to make the program catch up with tuition, which continues to rise much faster than inflation.

The lack of commitment by state and federal government disturbs Tom Mortenson, a higher education policy analyst in Iowa.

 He crunched the numbers that show just 6 percent of kids from families earning less than $35,000 earn a bachelor's degree before turning 24, compared with 51 percent for kids from wealthier families.

 "What are we doing here? If we limit this (higher education) to people who come from the most privileged backgrounds, are we saying to the poor, like the immigrants moving to Iowa, `Sorry. You can clean out our homes. You can weed our gardens. But you don't have a shot at what we have created here for ourselves.'" Mortenson said. "It's just un-American. We ought to hang our heads in disgrace."

Robert J. Smiddy Research Award receives $5,000 donation



In honor of Robert J. Smiddy, an FIU student who suddenly passed away last September, the Armando Alejandre, Jr. Feb. 24 Memorial Foundation has donated $5,000 toward the establishment of a Robert J. Smiddy Research Award, which has currently passed the $20,000 mark and is climbing to the $25,000 mark needed for endowment.

The Armando Alejandre Foundation learned of Smiddy and the scholarship after foundation  members read a story about it in The Miami Herald. Foundation officials contacted Kalai Mathee, assistant professor for the Department of Biological sciences and offered the generous gift.

According to Mathee, Smiddy worked in the Biological Science lab as part of his Honors College biology curriculum. 

"The work [Smiddy] was conducting could potentially lead to a drug package that would lengthen the life span of cystic fibrosis patients and improve their quality of life," said Mathee. 

Smiddy's research focused on a bacterium that attacks cystic fibrosis patients, causing respiratory failure. But, Mathee and other students in Smiddy's lab, said that they will complete Smiddy's research and have his thesis written by the Spring of 2005. 

The oldest of eight children, Smiddy was a former All-Dade swimmer, talented pianist and aspiring doctor before a ruptured spleen cut his life short.

Armando Alejandre is a former FIU graduate (1988) who was one of the Brothers to the Rescue volunteers shot down in 1996 by Cuban jet fighters as he patrolled the Florida Straits in a humanitarian search-and-rescue mission. The foundation that now donated the event was established after Alejandre's death.



C.A.M.P. 4 Justice Foundation establishes scholarship program



The C.A.M.P. 4 Justice Foundation donated a $100,000 gift to establish and endow an Alumni Association scholarship program for full-time, degree-seeking FIU students. 

The program, created to honor the memory of the four Brothers to the Rescue volunteers who perished when their planes were shot down by Cuban MiG fighter jets in 1996, will help support students interested in furthering the cause of human rights and help support the idea of memorializing the four Brothers to the Rescue volunteers. C.A.M.P. is an acronym that stands for the first names of the victims ­- Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre Jr., Mario de la Pena and Pablo Morales.

"This is a milestone in the history of the FIU Alumni Association," said Bill Draughon, associate vice president for Alumni Relations. 

While the first scholarship is set to be awarded this June, representatives from the Alumni Association and C.A.M.P. 4 Justice Foundation will have an opportunity to participate in the applicant selection process. 

Under current guidelines, the gift will qualify for $50,000 in state matching funds.

Michael Mendez ('03), director of the foundation, is the nephew of Costa, one of the Brothers to the Rescue volunteers who was killed. As a member of the Alumni Association Board of Directors, Mendez has been the driving force behind the scholarship endowment.



Memorial held in honor of Cuban victims



U.S. Congressmen Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart gathered on Feb. 22 to honor the thousands of men, women and children who have been the victims of the Cuban dictatorship for the past 46 years. As part of the event, held at the Tamiami Park next to the University Park campus, the park was converted to sacred ground and rows of crosses bearing the names of the victims were laid out across the green.

Headline: New fraternity colonizes at FIU
Author: Chris Rodriguez  / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A new member will be added to the FIU Greek system in the upcoming Fall semester.

After voting to expand in Fall 2004, Campus Life and Greek Affairs decided to bring Beta Theta Pi to campus.

Founded in 1839, Beta Theta Pi is most known for keeping a treasury of fraternity songs and its pink and blue colors. Beta will be up and running by October 2005 with assistance and commitment from its national headquarters located in Oxford, Ohio. Shirts, banners and buttons reading "Go Beta" will be distributed throughout the campus come fall.

Beta Theta Pi will start off as a colony and will be charted based on its success on campus. When a colony is chartered, it means the organization is ready to act independently. 

However, there are many criteria a colony must meet to achieve this - campus involvement, steady numbers and good colony relations are a few.

Colonies are subject to more stringent rules and are supervised closely by their national headquarters.  

Despite a steady number of students joining fraternities in recent years, Greek Affairs feels that a healthy dose of competition will increase fraternity recruitment numbers throughout the university.

 "I look forward to the healthy competition they will bring to our Greek community," said Karen Katz, head advisor for Greek Affairs, who is very excited about having Beta Theta Pi come to FIU. "When there is a bigger wave in the ocean, it'll bring all the ships up." 

Many feel that a larger Greek community will benefit many university activities at FIU. 

"When you have a new fraternity on campus and they want to help us in attendance - that's wonderful and exciting," said Athletic Director Rick Mello.

The organization plans on recruiting 20 to 45 men come fall Rush. Fall Rush is when most fraternities get their men, during the Fall Rush Week, most fraternities recruit new members.  

In an effort to assure the fraternities success, Beta's national headquarters is dedicating money to create an alumni advisory board for the colony prior to its arrival on campus. It will also station a delegate in Miami to oversee the organization throughout the first year.

Headline: Alvarez promises to expand metro-rail system at FIU
Author: Damian Grass / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Introduced by FIU's President, Modesto A. Maidique, the new Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez, delivered his first State of the County address to a large audience of supporters, county employees, elderly citizens and FIU graduates and students at the Pharmed Arena on Feb. 18.

"I am beginning a journey," said Alvarez. "My goal is to make Miami-Dade County government more responsive, respected and results-oriented."

The FIU graduate, who earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1974, delivered his plans to increase commissioners' salaries, begin a new wellness program for the county's elderly, create alternatives to jailing the mentally ill, fight juvenile delinquency, and improve the public transportation system by providing more transit buses to more places. 

Included in his goals, is the expansion of the metro-rail system with a new station at the University Park campus.

The new transit service at UP will provide FIU students, faculty and employees a more convenient way to beat the daily traffic - an idea which sounded promising to some people in the audience.

"I was very surprised to hear about a possible rail station at FIU," said Maria Gomez, an FIU alumna and county employee. "I would have surely taken advantage of that service if it was available when I was going to this school." 

With construction in progress for a new Greater Miami Performing Arts Center in downtown Miami, Alvarez has also initiated plans to create a new stadium for the Florida Marlins.

"After so much debate over the arena, it's great to finally hear that the mayor is totally behind the issue," said student Alex Gonzalez.

"Together with the arts, museums and cultural facilities, professional sports are an important part of our community fabric," Alvarez said. "We are destined to be a world-class venue, something our children and grandchildren can forever look on with satisfaction and pride - something all of us can be proud of."

The loudest and longest applause of the event came when the Cuban-native announced his plans to create new jobs and an environment in Miami-Dade County that "attracts employers, encourages business expansion and expands opportunity."

Despite Alvarez's mention of his contentious policies to reform government by limiting the County Commissioners' power, prohibit urban development expansions into the Everglades and proscribe the legalization of slot machines in racetracks and gaming houses, the Mayor's speech was well received.   

"I do have vision," Alvarez concluded. "I see a Miami-Dade County that is a better place - a place where all of us are proud to say this is our home."

Alvarez is a former director for the Miami-Dade Police Department and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medallion in 2001. He was also the commencement speaker for the university's graduating class of Fall 2004.

Headline: Sex-talk teaches students healthy sexual habits
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Wearing colorful clothing and a smile, a slim woman with blue eyes and short reddish hair entered the Graham Center middle ballroom on the morning of Feb. 14. She introduced herself to each student present and also asked each of their names and majors.

"Broadcast - that's great," she exclaimed to one student. "You can broadcast sexual responsibility!"

Marilyn Volker didn't need anybody else to "work the crowd." For as long as she spoke - in a tone that was simultaneously conversational, direct and cleverly humorous - ripples of good-natured laughter broke out around the ballroom. She was there to give a lecture, but captured the audience even before she got started.

Volker, known simply by her first name, is almost 60 years old but looks 20 years young. She manages to remain happily married and at the same time deeply involved in her career - sexology.

Volker's secret must be good sex. However, her definition of the term might differ from what you may think.

For four years now, Volker has been giving the lecture "Sex with Marilyn" as a special event for the Wellness Center at FIU. This year, she explained that good sex begins with properly getting to know and caring for one's private parts, which she referred to by their proper name and as being "not ugly" as well as nothing to be ashamed of. 

"Would you let a doctor touch you without a glove?" she asked the audience. "No, right? Then why would you let somebody put their mouth on your [unprotected] genitals?"

Volker emphasized the importance of using condoms not during intercourse, and during oral sex for the giver and receiver. She demonstrated how to use protection and passed condoms out, some even mint or strawberry flavored, to students who asked her questions or volunteered to answer hers.

In spite of all the sex-talk, Volker made sure to mention that abstinence is still the only foolproof way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.

"[What I like the most is] basically her interaction with the public. I admire that. It makes it more open and you feel more comfortable, like you're talking to your friend. It's awesome," said sophomore Carlos Ojeda who also attended the lecture last year.

During the discussion, Volker presented her idea of eight types of intimacy in a relationship. "Sexual intercourse" is at the bottom of the intimacy list, both because of the position of private parts on the body and because it should be the culmination of all the other important intimacy factors between two people: non-sexual demonstrations of affection, a non-sexual physical connection, emotional compatibility, spiritual tuning, how they interact socially with each other, their ability to relate intellectually and their willingness to share "something beautiful."

Volker was sexually assaulted on her university campus at the age of 17. But instead of becoming a victim, she became an educator on sexuality.

"[I go around] universities and I teach doctors and nurses and teachers and counselors. I teach the military, the airforce, the navy, the marines," Volker said. I have a private practice [in Coral Gables] where I see people in sex therapy. I helped to start the first AIDS project in the 1980's, and helped to start the first gay and lesbian youth group in the 1970s. I'd like FIU to start a lot more things about sexual responsibility."

Volker now offers sexuality classes at FIU for teachers and will offer one for students on Tuesdays and Thursdays during Summer B.    

"Giving people information; that's what an educator does," Volker said. "But when I also see couples that come in, and they've been arguing and they've been hurt, and then they decide they really want to work on these things together and repair ... it's wonderful to be a part of that. It's a very humbling job."

Headline: Dollar store treasures: the cure to boredom
Author: Raquel Cool / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It is time to dust off your Scrabble board and become one with the dollar store. Revamping board games by adding a fun twist will send you well on your way to saying no to "board-dome" faster than you can say, 

THE SCRABBLE CORK BOARD

It's your favorite word-play game, minus the word-play. It's a Scrabble cork board with lettered push pins!  Revamping this classic is a great way to dress up your room and impress your friends with your extensive vocabulary.

You'll need a bunch of flat pushpins (sold in certain dollar stores), industrial strength craft glue (E600 is sold in art stores), a corkboard big enough to mount the Scrabble board and of course, the game of Scrabble. Now, unless you're fortunate enough to have a neglected game sitting around, purchasing one might require a little thrift store luck.  

While the cost of a new board is about $20, thrift stores sell them for a fraction of the cost. So, keep your eyes open next time you're wandering around Hialeah's Flamingo Plaza.

Once you've got your materials together, you're ready to craft harder than you've ever crafted before.  

Apply a pea-sized glob of glue onto the back of the desired Scrabble letters and stick the flat surface of the pushpins onto it. Let them set with the Scrabble tile face down for at least 24 hours.  

While the letters dry, mount the Scrabble game onto the corkboard with craft glue. The next day, happily jab your finished Scrabble pushpins onto the board to spell out all the abbreviations, proper nouns and slang your heart desires.

DOLLAR STORE BINGO

Most people would doubt the purpose of buying a $6.99 bingo cage set, but I have a general rule of thumb that guides my crafty purchases. If I am spending less than or equivalent to what a student's admission price is to the latest, say, Lindsay Lohan movie, I just shrug my shoulders and assure myself that I am not likely missing out on much. Then, I high-five myself and say, "Bingo rules." Because it does.

The nice thing about it is that you don't even need an official Bingo cage set.  

To be quite honest with you, I really just enjoy the soft clatter of the numbered plastic balls rolling around. In fact, regular old Bingo games are sold quite cheaply at discount stores. Just keep your eyes open for them.

After this, you're ready for the dollar store hunt. I like to make it a habit to stop at every dollar store I see. While some are terribly disappointing and not even real dollar stores (anything priced over a dollar is cheating), there is generally at least one worthy product in each store.  Whether it is Warheads toothpaste at 99 Cents Stuff or a quirky hologram photo album at the Dollar Tree at International Mall, a steady collection of these items makes for great prizes. It is amazing how excited a group of people can get over candy cigarettes.

But don't limit yourself to dollar stores.  If you want to splurge, check out the silly string disguised as Krazy String for $2 at Big Lots. Peeps marshmallow makers are sold at Wal-mart for $2.50. Cans of neon spray sidewalk chalk are sold in the same aisle.  By all means, run, don't walk.  

My advice to you is this: Few things are more satisfying than nostalgia and a gimmick; combine the two, and you've created genius.

Headline: 'Marisol' offers a  profound look at humanity
Author: Elena Bellon / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For anyone who has ever experienced difficult times, trying circumstances and problematic situations, Jose Rivera's "Marisol" is your on-stage relief. With an unraveling plot line that is true to its "magical realism" nature, "Marisol" is not a play that keeps your mind wandering. The play delivers harsh realities of an apocalyptic world in which chaos and wild occurrences keep you rooting for its heroine - Marisol.  

Our main girl has undoubtedly seen better times when she is suddenly called upon by her guardian angel to choose a fighting side for the sake of the human race. 

The journey Marisol experiences is one of fear and excitement while new revelations unfold before her eyes. Directed by Geoffrey Tangeman, "Marisol" is an inspiring and exceptional plight for peace that reaches beyond our standards of struggle. 

Struggle is a concept commonly used by Hispanic playwrights such as Jose Rivera, Nilo Cruz and Luis Valdez to appeal to the dramatic senses of the audience.  

"[It] is amazingly profound, beautifully written with a universal message," said Tangeman. "It is a commentary on the power of the individual on global society and what they have to offer. The journey Marisol undertakes helps her to realize how valuable she is and looks at her purpose differently."  

Tangeman said that directing "Marisol" was challenging but also rewarding because Rivera's "poetic language" is told through the talented FIU thespians. Tangeman felt fortunate to be able to work and collaborate with the gifted and artistic students.

"Marisol encourages global consciousness," Tangeman said.

While "Marisol" is comical and entertaining, it also offers the audience a profound look at the best and worst of humanity. It is a heart-felt yet tragic, real yet imagined, threatening yet reassuring work of live, theatrical art.

Headline: AFFLICTED: GETTING THE MOST OUT OF YOUR TIME IN THE SICK BAY
Subheadline: How to: A series by Alicia Bustamante
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Opinion Page Designer
&nbsp;
It's late in February and the flu season is in full swing. It's a time when everyone is on their toes, carrying around hand sanitizer and Echinacea pills and spraying pens with entire cans of Lysol. As carried away as people get, they have a good reason. 

Being sick sucks - or rather, being sick and not being in fifth grade sucks. As you lie alone in your bed staring at the door, you know your mom isn't climbing up the stairs to bring you chicken soup and comic books. 

You're not going to turn on the TV to find "Darkwing Duck." Your Super Nintendo is collecting dust in an attic somewhere, and the puppy that once laid by your side is now so old it only gets up to eat and crap. Face it, you're in your 20s- gone are the days of innocence and cocoa puffs.

So now what can you do? You can't call your friends. They're out drinking. You can't call your mom. Now that you're out of the house, she's probably out drinking too. And you certainly can't call the guy you've only been dating for a week. Holding your hair back as you throw up doesn't really constitute as a third date. It's not mini-golf.

And once you realize the mass-text message that reads "I'm sick. Please love me" hasn't yielded many responses, you have to give up. You're sick and you're alone. Here's how to deal with it.

Everybody Hurts, Sometimes

The first stages of illness are the most intense and the best time to whine. Let it all out. Whimper and meander around your room in your tattered robe and your even more tattered pride. After about 30 minutes, you'll even get sick of yourself. Take two pills (anything with "p.m." in the name) and go to bed. Never underestimate the power of hibernation.

When you wake up sweaty and disoriented after 12 hours, you'll be delirious and ready to enter the second stage - the bad taste-a-thon.

Come sail away with me

Sometimes, being sick is the only time you can be alone. Between the violent outbursts of throwing up, you might get a chance to think and act as you really are.

This being said, you can pretty much do whatever you want. You can rock out to Jethro Tull and Aqua, watch bad Pauley Shore movies and taped episodes of "Saved by the Bell." You're alone, and you're sick. Who can blame you for your horrible taste?

If anyone does happen to show up, you can always blame everything on your altered medicated state.

I feel fine

There is going to come a point where you either go stir crazy, or are bound to an obligation you have to fulfill. You may use words like "must," "duty" or "responsibility" to justify leaving the hot zone. I implore you to restrain yourself. No matter how cooped up you feel, you're going to feel 10 times worse once your medicated high wears off.

You may be told stories about how you went on a 20-minute tangent talking about quantum physics in your Shakespeare class. 

Or, you may find yourself on the nightly news after an ordeal at your part-time job where it is reported that after a customer told you he didn't know your place of employment had a return policy, you punched him in the face. That day-quil is some crazy stuff.

Is that daylight?

After a good 36 hours of quarantine, you may want to begin integrating yourself back into humanity. This may take some time. After being away for so long, you may find that things have changed. The world might have stopped turning or humans might have become dancing slaves to an alien race or something ridiculous like that. More likely, you'll find that things are exactly the same and the world dealt with your absence. 

In that case, grab a beer with your mom. You can tell her how you survived and more importantly, ask why she didn't respond to your text message.
