Headline: "Love" leaves audiences dizzy
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Barry Egan of "Punch-Drunk Love" is the amalgam of every character we've ever seen Adam Sandler play. He's the innocent man-child of "Billy Madison," but without the mischievousness. He's the aggressive tackler of "The Waterboy" but without the idiocy. He's the lovelorn musician of "The Wedding Singer," but without the musical talent. He's the unsure introvert of "Little Nicky," but without that whole "Son of Satan" thing.  

In fact, the more you look at Barry Egan, the more it starts to make sense why P.T. Anderson, of "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia" fame, would want to go out of his way to direct a film specifically intended for Sandler. Barry's story represents what would happen if you placed the very fictitious characters Sandler typically plays  into a world more realistic than those of gross-out, vulgar little comedies. Instead of being laughably crazy, he's just plain crazy.

His life is a perpetual disaster of "getting by" at the start of the film. His seven sisters constantly mock and harass him, reminding him of embarrassing childhood moments, regardless of company. His business of selling designer toilet plunger handles bores him to the point that he spends half his time standing outside drinking coffee and the other half isolated either at his sales desk or in his office. He doesn't have the courage to attempt a love life, so he resorts to using a phone-sex line as an escape  from his boring, lonely life. All his passivity to the cruelty around him leaves Barry with deeply rooted aggression lurking deep beneath his surface, where he bottles all his hostilities.

But unlike, say, Happy Gilmore, who safely takes out his violence on the golf course, Barry has no spout. He's constantly building up reserve aggression until something causes him to snap and he blows. And when he blows, he goes psychopathic, attacking and destroying whatever is in his way. One sequence in a restaurant bathroom is so loud and intense, you almost worry that Barry's gone too far. You start fearing for characters lives at the hands of a deranged Barry. Instead, he calmly returns to his table, as if nothing ever happened. At which point, the cycle begins all over again. 

Unlike the bombastic three-hour long trial that is "Magnolia," "Punch-Drunk Love" races at a staggering speed, ending after only 90 minutes. It seems as though Anderson has finally understood the idea of "less is more." Whereas "Magnolia" was too much, "Punch-Drunk Love" offers not enough. There must be hours of footage on the cutting room floor. I simply refuse to believe Anderson was able to restrain himself so much with these characters. They exude the eccentricity that Anderson loves creating. From Barry's frequent flier miles to a pudding project to the mysterious artificial phone-sex line scam, every nuance of the film is riddled with quirk. Even the film's mantra and song, "He Needs Me" is quirky (the song is from director Robert Altman's "Popeye," a film so bad Robin Williams, Shelly DuVall and Altman probably wish everyone would forget).

What's so incredibly startling is the performance by Sandler. Sure, he's playing the same character he's played a hundred times before, but this time, under a completely different context, he manages to glide into a dramatic world smoothly. Many comedians have a hard time not only diving into dramatic fare but finding an audience to take them seriously. It may stand to be that Sandler puts more of himself into his comedy roles than we'd expect. Also startling and of significant notice is Emily Watson's Lena, Barry's love interest. You get the idea that the movie is hiding something about Lena, which makes her so much more sympathetic to Barry's plight than other characters.

The film is artsy as hell and not ashamed of it. The opening alone makes no sense unless you consider the event happening as a visual metaphor for the two main characters, Barry and Lena. There's also a kind of surreal brushstroke in the artistry of the picture, very similar to the interstitial music and color sequences through the film, like a scene from "Fantasia." Bright colors are constantly used to make frames look like elaborate splotches of bold color.

Despite being closer to reality than anything Sandler's ever been in before, "Punch-Drunk Love," still exists in a world where Barry can wear the same blue suit and be mocked for it, but Lena can wear the same red dress and never be called on it. It's also the same world where a man can travel from California to Utah with an unplugged telephone from his apartment so tight in his grip, he never lets it go.

"Punch-Drunk Love" is not a perfect film. There's plenty of open-ended questions that need filling and the ending, while relevant to the film's message, is very anticlimactic and awkward. There is no denying however, that the film is definitely a step closer to redefining the careers of both Sandler and Anderson. Here's hoping for another look into the life of a P.T. Anderson character as played by Sandler.

After all, anything is better than "Mr. Deeds."

Headline: Mick Jagger rocks crowds of all ages
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
The first time I went to a Rolling Stones concert I was floating in amniotic fluid inside my mother's womb and was not due to come into this world for another five months.  

I grew up in a home where Mick Jagger's voice was not an unfamiliar one. Being a Rolling Stones kid was a very strange experience, especially if one is Hispanic.  You happen to be the only kid at your birthday party who knows the words to "Sympathy for the Devil," your parents' love song is "Rainbow" instead of some Spanish soap opera theme song by Juan Gabriel, and your father renders a performance of "(I can't get) No Satisfaction" at the 2000 New Year's party that made Britney Spears' seem like true garbage.  

Twenty years later, the Stones are coming into town and this is my final chance to see what I consider to be the greatest rock n' roll band in all of history. 

These are the guys who were wild and crazy at the time The Beatles wore ties and had short hair. These are the bad boys of rock n' roll and my father and I got $300 seats for the hottest show in town.

We arrive at the American Airlines Arena around 6:30 p.m. and I am amused by the diversity of the crowd. This event truly broke age and ethnic boundaries. I see a woman in her 60s wearing a plastic, silver skirt and black, knee-high boots and I know that I am in for a big ride.

I walk over to my seat and almost pass out when I realize that 13 rows are the only thing that will separate me from Keith, Mick, Ronnie and Charlie. It seems too good to be true.

Shaggy opens the show, and although I was a little perplexed by this choice as the opening act, I realized that they needed someone who could equal Mick Jagger in pelvic movement.

 In this, Shaggy certainly brought some high competition to the British leading man. The crowd connected to the reggae vibe and the Jamaican singer's funny stage attitude certainly drew attention.  

The contagiousness of "It Wasn't Me" had the senior citizen couple, which I am sitting next to, bobbing their heads and clapping.  It was good entertainment.

Off the stage goes Shaggy and now we are waiting for what seems to be an eternity. My dad begins to tell me the story of how Keith Richards got caught partying with the wife of Canada's Prime Minister back in the '70s. I start laughing even though this might be the 10,000th time I hear this story. It is just that Keith happens to be our favorite and I can't help it.

At approximately 9:30 p.m., 15,000 spectators are already on their seats and the lights go out.   There is absolute silence. Suddenly, lights go on and I see the four of them running on stage to the sound of "Street Fighting Man."  

Mick is wearing a turquoise shirt with a glittery number 10 in the middle that looks like something he bought at Rave.  Charlie looks preppy and clean enough to appear in a Gap ad campaign.  Keith Richards looks like a bum, but the disheveled leopard-print headband is super sexy. And Ronnie looks like the typical rock star.

The first song is over and the band keeps on playing.  No introductions.  No interruptions.  The second song must be some of the newer repertoire because I don't know it and I don't see anybody around me singing it, but it surely has that Stones rock and blues mix with the saxophone and trumpet players in the back.

"Monkey Man" comes next and the half-naked lady behind me lights up a joint.  Jagger's energetic presence is all over the stage and the ape-like walk during this song assures me he is in great physical shape.

The band takes a quick break to introduce itself, as if necessary.  Jagger goes backstage and I see Keith approaching the microphone. Right then I know that some deep acoustics and some raspy, soulful vocals are about to resonate throughout the Arena.  

The man takes the lead for two songs, one of them "The Worst."  Richards is much less energetic than Jagger but he is the only one that can do justice to the words "Well I said from the first, I'm the worst kind of guy, for you to be around." 

My dad decides to turn this performance into a duet and begins to sing with a froggy voice worthy of the Budweiser commercial.  He only stops after I tell him that people only want to listen to Richards.

 Jagger returns to stage even more pumped singing "Start Me Up" and the crowd is chanting every word at the top of their lungs. Things get spicy with a Latin/Rock/Blues performance with a strong sax and Ronnie Woods' guitar takes on a Santana-like flavor. The only word to describe this moment is trance-like.

By the time "(I Can't Get) No Satisfaction" comes up, Jagger's feet have covered every inch of the stage and everybody is shaking their hips. The band moves to a second stage located right down the middle of the Arena and perform Bob Dylan's timeless "Like a Rolling Stone." 

 This is the most touching moment in the whole show. The fans are singing word for word with outrageous passion and I can tell people are singing this song like it is the last time. 

I think about how this might be the last tour of this legendary band and begin to sing even louder.

"Brown Sugar" is up next and Mick Jagger's hips are shaking uncontrollably. The band returns to the original stage and tons of red pieces of paper shoot up into the air and rain down on the audience, as the quartet performs "Jumpin' Jack Flash." The show ends, the band takes a quick bow, and is off the stage.  

The crowd definitely wants more but you can't have too much of a good thing. So they didn't play "Sympathy for the Devil," but it still was the best concert ever. 

The Rolling Stones have been able to do what no other band in the history of rock n' roll has ever done. They have defied all obstacles and time does seem to be on their side. 

After years of partying and good music, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Woods can still walk on stage shirtless and bring the house down.

Headline: Smith carries FIU to victory
Subheadline: Running back rushes for record 262 yards
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Talk about a scary sight on the year's scariest night. Rashod Smith may not be the most intimidating individual when he takes the field for the Golden Panthers (Smith stands at 5'7 and weighs 184 lbs.), but the size of the holes his offensive line created for him were  bigger, and scarier, and paved the way for Smith's school-record 262 rushing yards and two touchdowns for an FIU victory over Jacksonville (2-7), 39-6 on Halloween night.
"We pushed the defense around, but [Smith] had to make the cuts and the runs," center Victor Cernius said. "I've never seen anyone with his quickness."

The Golden Panthers (4-5) started slow but eventually utilized every advantage possible over their fatigued opponents. 

"We laid an egg in the first half," head coach Don Strock said. "For the first time all year I didn't see our team hustle 100 percent."

Despite this, FIU led at intermission 13-6.

Smith mounted his yardage on 21 carries and a combination of big runs, which included rushes of 47, 40, 39 and an 89-yard touchdown with 8:41 to play in the third quarter. The former Miami-Northwestern High School standout now owns two first-time accomplishments for FIU. Smith was named Division I-AA Player of the Week a month ago and is also the owner of the longest play from scrimmage in the team's history. 

"I could have had more if I didn't slip on some cuts," Smith said postgame.

Freshman quarterback Jamie Burke hit wide receiver Harold Leath for a 69-yard pass, Burke's longest completion on the season, in the third period that would result in a touchdown. Then came Smith's touchdown from 89 yards out.

Backup David Tabor tossed a 16-yard pass to receiver Cory McKinney for a 32-6 advantage. 

Jerrid Lundstedt added the final points, running in a score from 5 yards out.

Burke, who exited the game midway through the third, finished 10 of 19 for 185 yards and a touchdown.

Tabor ended the night 2-of-2 passing for 24 yards and a score.
McKinney led all receivers with 7 receptions for 99 yards and Leath had 90 of his own.

"It was nice to bounce back, especially in front of thousands of people on TV," Burke said.

On the defensive side of the ball, Nick Turnbull and Kris Thomas each had an interception. Thomas returned his pick 41 yards before being brought down. Greg Moss and Lance Preston both had 7 tackles to lead FIU.

"I give this Jacksonville team all the credit in the world," Strock said. "They came to play and obviously, we didn't have our guys ready to play right from the start."

"We came out and played really hard in the first half and I'm proud of our guys," said JU head coach Steve Gilbert. "We hung in and competed." The victory snaps a three-game losing streak for the Golden Panthers. 

The team is still in search of their first win over a Division I-AA scholarship program.

FIU has two contests remaining - Albany at home next Saturday and a date with winless Florida Atlantic at Pro Player Stadium on Nov. 23. 


News and Notes

With the victory Thursday night, FIU is assured of finishing with a winning record at home. The Golden Panthers stand at 4-2 at Community Stadium. The announced crowd of 5,221 was the smallest crowd this season.

Punt, pass and kick contest

At halftime, athletics hosted a punt, pass, and kick contest. Until Thursday, no participant had won the prize of $10,000. Samir Qureshi changed that when he punted a ball 36 yards, kicked a 32-yard field goal, and threw a 52-yard pass, becoming the first student to win the contest.

Who turned out the lights?

With 2:03 left in the game, the lights at Community Stadium went out forcing a 16-minute delay. Florida Power and Light said the outage could've been due to an accident possibly involving an animal.

Author: Daisy Fernández
&nbsp;
FIU's men's soccer team captured an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament with a 2-1 win over Hartwick on Sunday afternoon. 

FIU 2, Hartwick 1

The Golden Panthers 10th consecutive win clinched the ASC conference and improved the team to 10-4-1 overall.

FIU defender Bobby Boswell was ejected from the game early in the first half. Even though the Golden Panthers were one man down, FIU controlled the first period with a single goal by Matias Asorey. Asorey scored his 10th goal of the year in the 11th minute, with a header off a free kick by John Pulido. 

"They gave us a chance to attack and that's what we like to do," Asorey said. 

Hartwick University alsoreceived a red card at the 36th minute and midfielder Kevin Saunders of the Hawks was dismissed from the game.

In the 71st minute of the second half, Oscar Gil got behind a defender and directed the ball to Asorey. Asorey then scored his 11th goal of the season.

"They are not a bad team. I just think they never found a rhythm. Overall, they didn't attack as team, and just had individual plays here and there," Asorey said.

FIU outshot the Hawks, 19 to 10. FIU keeper Roy Rosenberg made 5 saves, and Hartwick's Moate made 13. 

"We have confidence at home and that's why we like to play here as much as possible. We've had problems on the road, and hopefully this berth will give us other chances to play at home," Asorey added.
 
FIU 5, Adelphia 3

Rain and lighting didn't stop the FIU. Despite the awful weather conditions that delayed Friday night's game, the men's soccer team continued its winning streak by defeating Adelphi 5-3.

Midfielder Adam Wilson opened up the scoring for FIU with the first goal two minutes into the match. The single-goal lead was taken away by Adelphi forward Haruto Imamura. At 11:57, Imamura took advantage of a deflection off FIU's goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg and evened the score.
FIU midfielder John Pulido was assisted by Asorey, as he scored his third goal of the season with a header. The Golden Panthers continued to dominate when forward Lucas Scudeler hit the back of the net from 10 yards out. 

Adelphi attempted to catch up with a goal by midfielder Tal Sheinfeld. In the 41st minute, Sheinfeld's unassisted shot slipped past Rosenberg, and brought the score to 3-2.

At 44:33, a corner kick by freshman midfielder Jared Rose allowed Oscar Gil to record his fifth goal of the season. 

In the second half an assist by Alvaro Aservi, Pulido scored his second goal of the night. He scored on a successful shot off a cross and secured the game for the Golden Panthers. 

FIU now awaits the announcement of its next opponent.

Headline: Point-Counterpoint: Bush
Subheadline: Forget the issues, Bush has character, experience
Author: Steve Perhla / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
While attending the Hurricanes-Gators game a couple months back in Gainesville, I noticed something you don't usually see in a football crowd – a politician. Not just any politician, but our governor, Jeb Bush. 

It's not every day that you happen to see a prominent public figure in such a wild, hostile environment. 

Even better was the fact that not only was he in the illustrious, intimidating "Florida Swamp," but sitting right in the middle of the Miami section, much to the dismay of many Gators' fans who threw plenty of verbal jabs Bush's way.

But that's what makes him so appealing. He's a normal, genuine, down-to-earth guy. 

Wouldn't you think that if you are going to attend a highly publicized rivalry game like that, you would at least sit and cheer along with the fans of the home team, the majority of the people there? You know, maybe rack in a vote or two? Shake a few hands? Kiss a few ugly babies? I think you catch my drift. 

But Bush was just keeping it real. He wasn't there to suck up to the residents of Gainesville. He was there to watch a football game, even if he was supporting the visiting team.

But looking at the issues at hand between Bush and McBride, I was pro-Bush even before I met him at the game. Forget the fact that McBride is going to raise taxes. Forget that McBride has  yet to provide Floridians with a reasonable prescription drug plan. Or disregard the fact that over the last year, Florida has led the nation in job growth. 

You can even choose to ignore that the number of African-American fouth graders scoring the highest level on the FCAT has increased from 81 students in 1998 to 871 in 2002, or that the number of Hispanic fourth graders has increased from 154 in 1998 to 1,553 in 2002.

However, there is one thing that puts the icing on the cake – something even more important than the issues at hand – and especially something that McBride seems to be lacking: character.

While Bush hasn't been the greatest governor in the world, he has been solid. His tax relief programs have worked for us, the people, by allowing Floridians themselves to choose how they spend their own money. 

And when a concerning question is brought up, Bush is quick to answer it the best he knows how, unlike McBride who commonly avoids answering the question, signaling he doesn't have a clue.

But above all, Bush has the experience. And it's that experience that is going to make Jeb Bush the governor of Florida once again – even if the Gator fans don't like it.

Headline: Point-Counterpoint: McBride
Subheadline: McBride offers fresh ideas, realistic solutions; Bush fails to keep promises
Author: Saudy Peña / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The only two questions voters should be asking themselves at the polls today are: have things improved since Jeb Bush was elected four years ago? And is he worthy of re-election as governor of Florida?

I think in both cases the answer is a firm no. 

I'm putting my vote in for the man who claims to "look out for the little guy," Bill McBride. 

Sure, he is inexperienced in the political world,  (Bush was as well), but as a respected business and civic leader, he certainly has the potential to bring about an active, new leadership that will improve the conditions created under the failing leadership of Bush. 	

McBride, the plain-spoken, former Marine turned lawyer, has a stronger record of community service than Bush had when first elected. 

With fresh energy, ideas, and more importantly, realistic solutions to Florida's problems, there is no doubt that Floridians should give his vision a chance.

Yes, Bush has taken steps forward in a few areas, (recently updating the state's growth management act), but his overall record has been unsatisfactory.

What happened to all the promises Bush made? In education especially, we have been severely let down. 

An issue that is of concern to college students, such as myself, is how ugly, pork-barrel politics have plagued our once respected state university system under Bush.  He has managed to reduce the pursuit of higher education to how much influence quarreling institutions can have in the legislature.

And in other areas, practically every national indicator reveals that the quality of Florida's schools have been embarrassingly poor.

Throughout his term, SAT scores, teachers' salaries, high school graduation rates and per-student spending, have all declined.

The man who once campaigned as "education governor" has clearly proven that he cannot deliver.

McBride on the other hand, has a long, detailed plan that will deal heavily with the education predicament.

It is based on a 50-cents-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes, (the only tax raise McBride advocates), and would help pay for teacher salary increases and class-size reduction in grades K-12. 

Also, it would provide for more funding to remedial programs, pre-kindergarten programs, and building new schools.

Similarly, on critical environmental and economic issues, Bush has promised a lot and delivered little.

McBride's new plans in this area are straight-forward and realistic, outlining a clear direction for improving the environment and Floridians' quality of life. 

While Bush boasts about his environmental record, organizations such as Sierra Club and the Florida League of Conservation Voters have endorsed McBride. 

Unlike Bush's short-sighted approaches, McBride wants to protect Florida's future by making several, progressive proposals, some of which are his intentions to make Smart Growth a priority, restore the Everglades via the judgment of independent science reviews as opposed to politics, make water management a top priority and permanently protect Florida's coastlines from offshore drilling. 

A man who worked his way through college through several part-time jobs (I'm sure many of us can relate) understands what hard work is.

Jeb Bush has been given his chance to better the state of Florida and, well, he has blown it – do we really need to give him a second try?

Florida cannot allow another four years of his kind of leadership. From giving tax breaks to the rich to the worsening conditions of DCF, I think we have seen the best the man can do. The state deserves better. 

I think Mr. McBride might just be able to come through where Bush left us empty-handed.

Headline: Education demands taxes
Author: Jason Andreasen / Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Taxes. It is arguably the dirtiest word in politics. Whoever is associated with their increase is almost always promised a short political career. At least, that's what Jeb Bush is counting on.

Over the past two weeks or so, Bush and the Republican Party have been running countless television advertisements telling us all how his opponent Bill McBride will hike up taxes to the point of financial asphyxiation. Unfortunately, the mere association with raising taxes might jeopardize McBride's bid for governor before anyone is able to realize it. 

The most important aspect of the election at hand is saving our educational system. Granted, there are other issues that are very important, but right now, none more so than education. McBride is the best shot that Florida has at accomplishing that goal.

Let us put this race and election in its proper context. Since Bush took office, succeeding one of our greatest, Lawton Chiles, the reputation of Florida has become nothing short of laughable. 

Our education system is consistently ranked near the bottom, if not at the rock-bottom of the entire nation. 

The Department of Children and Families has fallen to pieces and lost countless children in the process; meanwhile, the Sun-Sentinel finds it almost elementary to find some of them. 

The past two elections held have ended in foul-ups that landed us in the national spotlight. 

And of course, how could anyone forget, funding for drug treatment was all but completely abolished while Bush's own daughter was found with drugs in her possession.

Bush has crippled the state of Florida. How can a state as large as Florida consistently rank last in education and receive less funding than all but one state? This is not the type of leadership that Florida needs. History has proven this.

Back to the "T" word. So McBride might raise taxes. This is not something that we should automatically write-off as a bad thing. taxes are a necessary evil. We cannot criticize our lacking agencies, institutions and systems for lack of funding if we cannot even fathom offering them some funding. 

I realize that to some, it is a foreign concept that it takes money to run a government. That money comes from us. We must recognize that in order to receive quality public services, we must be willing to fund them. Thus, it is hypocritical to call for a better educational system or improvements in DCF and simultaneously slam McBride for even saying "taxes." 

Of course, Bush has his own remedy for his lack of commitment to education. You have probably seen the billboards featuring a smiling Bush and "$3 Billion for Education." Apparently Bush has one of those elusive money trees in his backyard to fix our educational system. Thank goodness.

The fact of the matter is that taxes are necessary. As a state, we must make a real commitment to education. How can we keep from being compared to the most backwards states when our students can't even point them out on a map? 

Raising taxes (of course not drastically as Bush claims) might be the answer. We must recognize that the problems with our schools cannot be addressed with an empty promise of $3 billion. It takes real money. Think about it, wouldn't it be worth it if in a few years we weren't consistently ranked as the least educated state in the union? 

I hope that we as Floridians recognize our duty, not only to our children, but also to ourselves. Who wants to live in a state that views education as an unimportant burden? By re-electing Bush, we would be saying that we agree with his negligence of our educational system. 

Bush is counting on our fear of the "T" word. Hopefully, we will all vote to support the "E" word: Education. Now, more than ever before, we must make that our first priority, as McBride has. Won't it be worth it when we are producing better-educated Floridians rather than being seen as the laughing stock of the United States?

Headline: Candidates ignore higher education
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
While many newspapers choose to endorse a particular candidate during an election period, The Beacon has decided not to endorse either of the gubernatorial candidates in this election because neither of them appear to have much to offer Florida and especially, higher education.  

Bill McBride supports Amendment 9, which promises to have disastrous results for the state university system if passed.

Amendment 9 would reduce class sizes in grades K-12 largely by hiring new teachers and building more schools, and would cost the state an estimated $20 billion to $28 billion over the next eight years.  McBride has proposed to fund these changes with a 50-cent-per-pack tax on cigarettes, however, the revenue that could be generated from such a tax would fall short of the required sum.  To compensate for the deficit, higher education funding would undoubtedly be cut.

Though Jeb Bush is against this amendment, his education policies are not without their flaws.  Through the enactment of One Florida, Bush abolished affirmative action.  Since then minority enrollment at certain state universities has decreased significantly.  

Both candidates have dedicated a lot of time to campaigning about possible improvements to K-12 education, but neither has focused much on higher education.  One of the most intense education debates that has dominated the election is Florida's dependency on standardized testing to foster school accountability and determine funding.   While this is an important issue that should be addressed, higher education should not be ignored.  

A college education has become an essential factor in succeeding in the job market, thus the quality of higher education needs to be preserved.

Headline: Republicans gain ground, student opinion varies
Author: Sara Henderson
&nbsp;
The latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup survey of today's elections shows a decided shift in sentiment among likely voters toward republicans. Two weeks ago, democrats led by three points, 49 percent to 46 percent, but the latest poll shows republicans leading by six points, 51 percent to 45 percent. This is also evident in Florida's gubernatorial race where incumbent republican Governor Jeb Bush leads with eight points over democrat Bill McBride.

But this lead does not worry 13-year teaching veteran Virginia Perwin. 

"I will vote for McBride. The [teacher's] union is backing him," Perwin said. 

A current adult education graduate student, Perwin questions Bush's education track record, "Bush hasn't done anything about education. The lottery was supposed to fund education and we've waited for years."

Perwin is not the only teacher in her family and knows all too well the importance of this election even though she is still not completely satisfied with all of McBride's campaign promises.

"My daughter is a teacher, and we have issues about McBride, but we're willing to give him a chance."

Across the table from Perwin sat English major Adriana Rivero who doesn't see things the same way.

"I'm voting for Governor Bush because of his plan for education. I think he's a big supporter of education," Rivero, a junior, said. "He wants to shrink class size. I think that's important because we see so many kids per class. How can kids learn?"

Other students are supporting Bush because of his experience.

"I see what he's already done during his [first] term as governor in Florida," communications senior Lizette Alvarez said. 

Larry Rubio, a senior double-majoring in marketing and management information systems, is not voting for either candidate. Rubio doesn't have faith in the new voting technology.
"It's not user friendly. It's faulty altogether," Rubio said. "The votes aren't registered properly." 

Rubio knows about the system from his brief exposure as an intern for the elections department.  Rubio believes that the previous, less technologically sophisticated system was more beneficial for older voters, who vote more often.

For graduate student Kendal Moora, elections are not even an option. The international student is not a citizen. However, he still feels the race is "just two different attempts at trying to solve the problem of quality education."

Some FIU students are not interested in the race at all. 

"I never think about it. I'm not voting because I didn't even know it was on Tuesday," management information systems major Alex Escobar said.

Headline: Studies expect 23 percent of youth to vote
Author: Wendy Navratil / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Call them the dissed generation – disengaged, disinterested and disaffected – around election time, anyway. They're America's 18- to 30-year-olds, and some are even bored of hearing how bored they are.

Ray Carroll, 24, distributed campaign materials in the Starbucks parking lot across from Chicago's Wrigley Field last weekend with a group of Republican Young Professionals.

"A lot of people my age have gotten lackadaisical," Carroll admitted. 

"Younger people are starting their careers, they're focused on saving money, starting a family. They're not looking for anything from government," said Doug Ibendahl, 39, Illinois coordinator and co-founder with his fiance, Cathy Santos, of Republican Young Professionals. "That's exactly the kind of sentiment we're trying to tap into. That's exactly why they should be voting Republican."

Politicians talk the talk about engaging younger voters. But many, aided and abetted by their consultants, have become privately convinced that the way to go is to skew older. 

But the neglect goes both ways.

"For 30 years, young voters have been pulling back from the electoral arena," said Thomas E. Patterson, a Harvard political scientist. "In 1972 turnout was 50 percent among 18- to 30-year-olds. It was barely above 30 percent in 2000. That's a big drop even in the context of a general decline." On Tuesday, 23 percent are expected to vote.

"We're trying to dispel the engrained cynicism among campaign staff and candidates themselves that young adults aren't worth going after," said Adam Anthony, project director of the nonpartisan Campaign for Young Voters in Washington, D.C. "What we tell candidates is to look beyond broad numbers to specific potential."

That potential is somewhere around 30 million adults under 30 who did not vote in the last presidential election. One survey estimated that 90 percent of 15- to 25-year-olds don't have strong political allegiances, Anthony said, which creates a vast pool for conversion to either side.

Without a doubt, it takes money and some savviness to reach young people. They're not the ones paying hundreds of dollars a plate at political fundraisers. Along with free drinks at a recent Democratic Youth to the Booth event at Rive Gauche nightclub in Chicago, young Democrats were offered a $200 stipend to board buses this weekend to Missouri and South Dakota, sites of key Senate races, for a get-out-the-vote effort.

The adventure of a road trip might have been persuasive enough if it weren't midterm-exam time, said Tina Valkanoff, 21, president of the College Democrats at Northwestern University, who was hoping to ride along to Missouri. "I'll have 700 pages of reading to do in between," she said.

Headline: Winter courses to be offered on South Beach
Subheadline: Christina Kent / Staff Writer
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Students from colder climates will have an opportunity to take up to six credits in sunny South Beach during their winter recess this January.

The two-week intersession, hosted by the College of Continuing and Professional Studies, will be held at the Wolfsonian Museum on Washington Avenue.

Four classes are being offered, ranging from architecture and advertising to Woody Allen.

The program, advertised in the campus newspapers of Northeastern United States colleges including Newark and Rutgers as "a class or two, the rest is up to you," is designed to put FIU on the map. 

"We feel that South Beach is a definite draw. People can recognize 'SoBe' like they can recognize 'SoHo'," Tallulah Brown, the program director, said. "One may want to get out of the snow and the slush of the north to come to a location a block away from the ocean." 

The four-hour courses can be used by visiting students to fulfill elective credits that transfer to another college, or a local may sign on to take the classes for fun,  Lori Serure, marketing director for the program, explained.

Payment of $1,995 covers a package deal that includes one three-credit course, discounted hotel accommodations and a daily continental breakfast at the recently restored art-deco style Best Western South Beach. A second three-credit course may be added for $500. Commuter students may take three credits for $750, not including hotel accommodations. A noncredit course for a commuter student is $600.

Brown mentioned that students taking the architecture courses will likely spend little time in a lecture room.

"I was interested in finding faculty members who are adventurous and would agree to teach these classes in a different location and different time frame," she said. "I picked these teachers because I had knowledge of what their capabilities and strengths were, kind of like a sampler of our better classes [at FIU]."

"I think teaching at the Wolfsonian is very exciting, which in itself is set within the national historic district of art deco," John Kneski, who will be teaching the Architectural Landscape of Miami – Visions and Constructs, said. "My method will be different because the setting will allow me to teach out of the classroom often and because of what I'll have available to me within the museum."

Film buff Richard Schwartz will be teaching a course about Woody Allen films.  Schwartz wrote "Woody – From Antz to Zelig," in 2000 as well as a book on Ridley Scott and other Cold War related films.

"I hope they enjoy Allen's humor and gain an appreciation for his artistry as it pertains to issues of plot and story and depth of understanding of human relationships," Schwartz said. He is also the director of FIU's Film Studies Certificate program. "Allen addresses the question: 'How do we live a viable and meaningful life in such an absurd world?" he said.

"I think this is great for the university because it makes us even more international than we already are," Kirk Chin, sophomore, management information systems, said.

"I wish FIU students had this available to them for their winter recess," Rocky Cook, senior, English, said, "It sounds great."

"Our intention was to bring FIU outside; make this available as an external program to non-Florida students," said Serure.

"The feedback has been extremely positive," Serure said, adding that they have already received inquiries from London and Paris, as well as university alumni and current students.

"This is great recognition for FIU because they see what we have to offer and they see our name," Serure said. "We have so much going for us right now: the 30th anniversary, the inaugural football game...this is like riding on the wave."
