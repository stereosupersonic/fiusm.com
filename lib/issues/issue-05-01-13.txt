Headline: FIU suffers two straight losses in Arkansas
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Maybe a nine-day layoff was too long. 

Having won the FIU Holiday Classic on Dec. 28, the Golden Panthers felt good heading into its Arkansas road trip to open the Sun Belt Conference schedule. 

On Jan. 6, the Golden Panthers lost to hosts Arkansas-Little Rock by 10, 67-57. Making shots hurt FIU as the team shot just under 38 percent from the field and under 56 percent from the free throw line. 

This game saw Ismael N'Diaye lead the way for the Golden Panthers with Junior Matias, who returned from a back injury and the birth of his new daughter. N'Diaye sat for just one minute the entire game and shot 6-of-9 from the field to finish with 15 points. 

Matias, who did not arrive in Arkansas until just before game time, added 11 points in his first action since two days before Christmas. 

Ivan Almonte, who had carried the club throughout Matias' absence, was held in check by the Trojans, scoring just 10 points with three rebounds in 31 minutes of action. 

FIU trailed from the start and never took the lead in front of an audience of 3,340 at Alltel Arena in Little Rock.  

Despite holding UALR's leading scorer Brandon Freeman to just nine points, the Golden Panthers were unable to subdue Zack Wright and Zack Graber who both added 15 points for the Trojans. 

Coach Sergio Rouco knew that the Trojans would be a tough team to beat. 

"Little Rock is one of the better programs in our league, and we knew coming in that this was going to be a tough fight," said Rouco.

In part, Rouco blamed a lack of experience for his team's struggles. 

"[UALR] is a veteran team that is ready for Sun Belt Play. They know what conference play means. We're a young team. My guys don't have a clue," Rouco said. 



ARKANSAS STATE 60, FIU 55



The Golden Panthers ended its two-game swing through Arkansas on Jan. 8 with a five-point loss to conference leaders Arkansas State. 

In front of an audience of just under 3,500 in Jonesboro, AK, Arkansas State, the top scoring team in the Sun Belt Conference, handed FIU a 0-2 start to conference play. 

"Our guys are beginning to realize just how tough the Sun Belt Conference really is," said Rouco in a post-game press release. "This league doesn't get enough credit. It's a very good basketball league."

FIU shot just under 46 percent from the field while holding the hosts to just 35 percent, but Dewarick Spencer's three-point basket with just 10.5 seconds left to play in the game proved to make the difference. 

Led by Matias' 16 points, FIU lead by five, 55-50 with just under two minutes to play. 

Spencer then hit two threes in the last minute-and-a-half, handing the Golden Panthers its third two-game losing streak of the season. 

Almonte and Jayce Lewis also were double figures for the Golden Panthers, who moved to 7-7 on the season and 0-2 in conference play. 

Senior center Byron Burnett led the Golden Panthers in rebounds with 11 boards and moved into an all-time fifth place on the FIU career blocks list with 57. He now finds himself just one behind Taurance Johnson and Jabahri Brown who graduated in 2003 and 2000 respectively. 

Arkansas State guard J.J. Montgomery led the way for the host who led 24-21 at the half. He converted on 8-of-17 shots from the field in just under 30 minutes for 22 points. 

The Indians now move to 9-4 in the season and 2-0 in conference play. 

"We'll learn from this as a group," Rouco said following the defeat. "This is a very good Arkansas State basketball team, and if we can play with them, we're going to win some games this season."

&nbsp;
The team looked tired and weak for all but six minutes of the game.

With Arkansas State leading by 15 with 7:47 left in the game, baskets by Asha Neal and LaQuetta Ferguson ignited a late FIU rally that sent the game into overtime before losing momentum and falling 85-74 to the Indians in the extra period.

"We didn't come out focused and that really showed, but we were able to come back and take it into overtime," said Ferguson. "Unfortunately, we didn't get it done."

FIU outscored the Indians 20-7 in the final six minutes of the games. Ferguson scored nine of those points and senior forward Milena Tomova added six. 

FIU looked fatigued throughout the game because coach Cindy Russo's team was playing its third game in six days. Arkansas State on the other hand, had a week to prepare for the Golden Panthers.

In overtime, FIU had nothing left in the tank as the team managed to score just four points in the final five minutes.

"We lost focus both physically and mentally," Ferguson said. "We were tired."

Coach Russo was proud of the team's late effort.

"[We] were in a fog," said Russo to The Miami Herald. "We've had a seven-day stretch with no time off. I was real proud of their late effort, but it was too little, too late."

The Golden Panthers record falls to 11-5 on the season and 0-1 in the Sun Belt Conference. 

The team was led by Tomova's 38th career double-double and 13th of the season. The team all star finished with 20 points, 13 rebounds, and a season high five blocks.

Ferguson added 15 points and Eva Makela added 13.

The game was the second straight overtime match for the Golden Panthers.

For the Indians, guard Ali Carter led the team with 23 points, eight of which came in overtime.

Even with the loss, Russo's team has won nine of the past 11 games.

FIU will begin a three-game stretch on the road at North Texas on Jan. 15.

Headline: NCAA waives standard, I-A status granted
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers scored its first victory of the offseason with a game yet to take place.

On Jan. 10, FIU was granted a second transition season of Division I-A football by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. 

The NCAA has also postponed the mandated attendance vote until April of this year.

In April, the NCAA will determine whether to continue the mandated rule of a 15,000 minimum average home attendance in the first two seasons while a university applies for  permanent status in Division I-A football.

In FIU's first transitional season that concluded in December, the program failed to meet the required attendance mark. FIU averaged 10,095 in home attendance, falling short of the 15,000 mark.

However with the cancellation of the games against Jacksonville and Western Kentucky due to Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne, FIU was granted a reprieve and waived off the mandatory attendance rule.

Athletic Director Rick Mello was pleased with the response from the NCAA. FIU's strategic plan for football was so well prepared that the NCAA will use it as a blueprint for other schools wishing to apply for I-A status.

"It was big because not only did the NCAA accept our report, but it will also be used as a future model for all schools who wish to make the move," said Mello. "It speaks of the preparedness of our program and how we have followed through."

At the Third Annual FIU Football Banquet held the same day of the announcement, football head coach Don Strock compared the news to a light at the end of a tunnel. 

Strock congratulated his team and welcomed the challenge of the top teams that FIU has already agreed to play, including Texas Tech, Wisconsin and next season's opener Kansas State.

Whether the NCAA will continue to enforce the attendance requirement next season will be determined in less than three months, but Mello says he wants to accomplish the feat no matter what.

"We are trying to hit 15,000 no matter what. It's our goal whether they have a criteria or not," said Mello.

Many people have questioned the reason for FIU moving towards Division I-A so quickly, but the NCAA liked FIU's plan despite having been the fastest university to reach I-A status in football.

"They liked our report, the way we planned and that we were very realistic in the report," said Mello. "I always knew attendance will be the hardest to reach, but we spent $90,000 on Method Man and Redman, so we tried."

Headline: Swimming and Diving team places second at invitational
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With the Golden Panthers hosting a swimming invitational on Jan. 9, the team did not want to disappoint the home crowd.

The Golden Panthers didn't as FIU placed second in the Golden Panther Invitational.

FIU placed second with 296.5 points in the event. Only Brown, with 781 points, had a better score than FIU. Cleveland State (290.5), George Washington (240) and Emory (156), rounded out the event.

Former Olympic veteran and current FIU head coach Noemi Lung Zaharia was pleased with the team's performance after an intense week of practice.

"The invitational came at the end of winter training which included very intense training practicing twice a day," said Zaharia. "The girls were quite tired but actually had nice conclusion to all the training." 

The girls motivated each other in the second place effort.

"They did a great job," Zaharia said. "All the cheering they did for each other really helped them get through after all the training."

With wins in the 500 and 1,000-yard freestyle events, Claudia Barsi led FIU and almost broke her own Bay Vista Aquatics Center pool records. 

In the 500, she touched the wall in 5:09.62, 31-hundredths of a second shy and in the 1000; she finished in 10:28.07, 21-hundredths of-a-second shy of her own record.

Zaharia was proud of the way Barsi represented the team.

"She came back this second semester and stepped it up quite nicely with good times," Zaharia said. "She helped the team out with big points."

Barsi felt good to be back.

"I was happy because I was ineligible the first semester," said Barsi. "In the end I was mad though because I wanted to break the pool record but I didn't."

Sophomore Megan Balkenbush represented FIU well with a win in the three-meter with 266.03 points, two points behind Brown's winner Jessica Larsen. Both performances for Balkenbush are NCAA Zone-qualifying marks.

Other members also set career marks in the event. 

Vanessa Segovia's time of 5:40.56 in the 500-yard freestyle was a season best.  

Carly Crandall set season-best marks in the 50 and 100-yard freestyle, touching the wall in 27.29 and 58.46 respectively.

The Golden Panthers will return to action on Jan. 15 in Jacksonville against Georgia Southern.

Headline: Keen senses keep animals from tsunami's wrath
Author: Anuradha Sawhney / People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
&nbsp;
In India, amid the constant talk of the disaster in the south, one theme has emerged: Few wild animals have been found dead. 

It seems that almost all of those who could fly, run, slither or crawl away quickly left their homes in advance of the killer waves and fled to higher ground.

Anyone who has lived in India has seen firsthand how animals act strangely before the first monsoon cloud bursts over the parched earth after many months of drought and how they become agitated well in advance of the kind of earthquake that can cause grown men to jump from rooftops in panic.

All this is understandable, given that most animals have keen senses of smell, sight or hearing that help them survive what are, to them, predictable calamities. 

Some scientists speculate that humans have lost these senses in the evolutionary process, although one can argue that they are still present to some degree, such as, for example, among relatively undisturbed aboriginal trackers.

Many animals, including elephants and mice, communicate via ultrasonic waves that can travel long distances and even penetrate buildings, dense forests and hills. 

Humans can hear sound waves that measure between 20 and 20,000 hertz, but these animals communicate using sounds that are lower than the ones in our range. 

Game wardens in Africa have found elephants trembling in fear and huddled up against the edge of their reserve, as far away as it was possible for them to get from a planned killing of their fellows in an adjoining forest. 

While the sounds of the distant elephant slaughter were inaudible to the human ear, far-flung members of the animals' own species were well aware of their distress and panic.

What we don't know is greater than what we do, but we do know that fish have a thin line of sensitive cells on their sides, cells that can sense movement, vibration and change in the direction of the current. 

So when a typhoon approaches, changing the current, the fish try to move to safer waters.

We also know that some species of tree frogs can send and receive not only mating messages but also warnings over great distances by drumming on logs with their feet. 

And polar bears are so sensitive to shifts in the atmospheric pressure that they can "smell" the electrostatic disturbances that occur within thunderstorm systems. 

The vomeronasal organ, also called Jacobson's organ, helps such animals detect chemical changes in the atmosphere (sometimes these organs are hidden just under the animal's lip so that when dogs or cats snarl, they are actually using their sensitivity to determine whether an approaching animal is friend or foe). 

Snakes and other reptiles use their tongues to sense such things and to "taste" the air.

Sadly, some animals in India cannot escape disaster, as hard as they may try and as well equipped as they are to do so. Among them are the animals caged and chained in zoos, the snakes and mongooses kept by fortune-tellers and "animal fighters" in rattan baskets and the miserable dancing bears and wing-clipped and caged birds one still sees beside the roads despite an Indian governmental ban on the capture of wildlife.

We know that here at home, many captive animals perished during the Florida hurricanes. 

Add to what we already lament in the aftermath of this hideous tsunami the thought that in times of disaster, some animals must be desperate to flee but unable to do so. 

To have a survival advantage but not be able to use it - this, too, is a tragedy.

Headline: Feminism : The new F-word
Author: Anne Kim/The Seattle Times
&nbsp;
Man hater. Bra burner. Cold. Militant. 

We've all heard them, these less than flattering stereotypes to describe feminists. 

It's not surprising, then, that most young women today aren't eager to be labeled feminist and are, in fact, casting off the term entirely. 

Magazine articles and books have cropped up, labeling feminism as the new "f-word" among Gen X and Gen Y women. 

At the same time, however, studies continue to show that significant gender inequalities persist, including lower wages and fewer job promotions for women as compared with their male counterparts. 

Big surprise. Yet, there's a connection here. 

Unless young women look past the stereotypes of feminism, re-define the term and take ownership of this political identity, the gender inequalities that loom in our future will continue. Women will continue to earn less than men and have fewer chances to climb the company ladder, for example.

We need to start calling ourselves the feminists that we already are. 

Unfortunately, this isn't happening for many young women. 

An informal survey I took of several local young women I know showed that they simply don't see themselves as feminists, and don't think it matters. 

When asked whether they call themselves feminists, almost all paused, thought for a minute, and finally concluded that they are not feminists. 

Many said because feminism requires political activism and because they're not out on the streets picketing for equal wages or other causes, they must not be a feminist. 

Yet, most of these women actually fit into their own broad definitions of feminism. For example, a friend of mine said feminism is a desire for gender equality. She desires this. 

I would be surprised to hear her or any other young woman say that she wants to be paid only 75 percent of men's wages or that her post-college plans include subservience to her husband, for example. 

Indeed, according to local author Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, the "third wave" of feminists today believe that feminism is a self-defined term ­- a feminist can be a stay-at-home mom, a career woman and anything in between. 

Yet, students like my friend continue to deny their feminist ideologies. 

Perhaps the refusal to identify themselves as feminists is, in part, a way to avoid political activism. Or maybe many young women take for granted what our mothers and grandmothers have fought for. 

Perhaps many think there is no need for feminism anymore, that men and women have equal pay, recognition and opportunities today.

More than 70 percent of women who acknowledge that the country still needs a strong women's movement admitted that they have never joined or made a donation to a women's rights organization, according to a Center for Gender Equality study. 

They also have never contacted their local politicians regarding issues that affect women. 

But this doesn't mean young women don't care about their communities. According to Rowe-Finkbeiner, author of "The F Word: Feminism in Jeopardy," young women commonly volunteer and engage in community service projects. Yet, she adds, many simply are not being politically active in women's issues. 

This is problematic. Without seeing oneself as a feminist, there's little motivation for political action in women's issues - by politicians or others. 

Ultimately, placing feminist concerns on the back burner only ignores the problems we as young women face. 

Gender inequalities, for example, are still stark and quite depressing. 

The gender wage gap widened between 2002 and 2003, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research. For every dollar a man earns, a woman earns only 75.5 cents. 

The glass ceiling also remains. Women constitute only 35 percent of officials and managers in private industry, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 

Participation of young women in the sciences and engineering is still uneven. In fact, women make up just 28 percent of computer science bachelor's degrees awarded in the U.S., according to the American Association of University Women. This number has dropped since 1984.

Even at the University of Washington, women engineering students I know often complain about being the only female in their group projects and study groups. 

Unless young women start thinking critically about what feminism means to us, why we choose to call ourselves feminist or not, and what this means for our futures and the futures of our daughters, these inequalities will continue to block our way.

Experts see 'devastating' attack on the Internet in next 10 years

Don't say we didn't warn you: At some point in the next decade, there will be a "devastating attack" on the Internet or power grid.

The scenario was deemed most plausible by 1,300 technology experts and scholars in a survey released Sunday by the Pew Internet & American Life Project.  

Pew, along with Elon University in North Carolina, sought the opinions of people-both in the United States and abroad-who know the Internet intimately or think about it a lot. About half of them were Internet pioneers, having been online before 1993. One-third was from academia, another third were from tech companies or consulting firms and the rest worked for non-profit organizations, publications or the government.

Of the experts surveyed by Pew in the fall, 66 percent agreed that the Internet or power grid would be successfully attacked. Only 18 percent disagreed or challenged the prediction.

Former CIA Director Robert Gates, speaking at a terrorism conference last month, said cyber terrorism could be the most potent weapon of mass destruction and could cripple the U.S. economy.

"When a teenage hacker in the Philippines can wreak $10 billion in damage to the U.S. economy by implanting a virus, imagine what a sophisticated, well-funded effort to attack the computer base of our economy could accomplish," he said.

Headline: Recruiting percentages drop due to outlook on war
Author: Frank James / Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
Staff Sgt. Patrick McClung reached for the phone in his impeccably squared-away office and heard an anxious father on the other end demanding to know why a Marine recruiter had cold-called his home, asking about his teenager.

To McClung it was clear the parent didn't appreciate the inquiry, insisting his child wasn't interested. So the sergeant tried appeasement. "Would you mind if I get their name and their number so we can go ahead and scrub them off our list so we don't have to contact them again, sir? All right, sir."

After the call, McClung, a 27-year old redhead who stands 6-foot-5 and is a top Marine recruiter, shrugged. "This morning I had a mom laugh at me and hang up the phone," he said.

For Marine recruiters, and their Army and Army National Guard counterparts to an even greater extent, these are challenging times and represent the first test of the all-volunteer military since the draft ended in 1973.

Determined to find new enlistees as the problem gets worse, the Army is adding nearly 1,000 recruiters in an effort to reach more young people, while the Guard intends to add about 700 recruiters.

The Army and the Guard also are increasing the financial rewards for enlisting. The Army is offering enlistees new $15,000 signing bonuses and the Guard $10,000 for recruits with no prior service. 

The Army also has increased its maximum college scholarship to $70,000 from $50,000. Meanwhile, the Guard has doubled, to $20,000, the amount it will provide to repay a recruit's student loans.

But the war in Iraq, and the continuing troop presence there, are the most sustained hostilities the U.S. military have seen since the Vietnam War. And that has fueled worries that the strains on the recruiting system could lead to a military meltdown, with too few personnel to fight the nation's engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Few experts, however, believe the result will be a return to a draft. There just isn't the political will for that.

The Army, which carries the greatest burden in the fight against the Iraqi insurgency as the United States' largest provider of ground forces, has encountered significant head winds in recruiting enough new enlistees.

It slightly exceeded its goal of 77,000 for the 2004 fiscal year. But the Army entered the new fiscal year Oct. 1 with far fewer recruits in its delayed-entry pool of enlistees. Those are recruits who join the service but defer the date when they ship out to boot camp.

The Army, which tries to start each fiscal year with enough delayed-entry enlistees to add up to 35 percent of its annual recruitment goal, said it began fiscal 2005 with just more than half that percentage.

Meanwhile, the Army National Guard, which missed its fiscal 2004 recruiting target of 56,000 by more than 5,000 recruits, continues to struggle, falling short of its goal for the first two months of the new fiscal year by about 30 percent.

"Things are tougher," said S. Douglas Smith, a spokesman for the Army Recruiting Command based at Ft. Knox, Ky., which recruits for the active Army and the reserves.

"We can't quite quantify the amount of impact (of Iraq), but we know it's there.

"One of the things we don't know for sure is how many people don't start contact with a recruiter who might have otherwise," Smith continued. "We do know anecdotally that our recruiters are spending more time talking to parents and influencers such as parents and educators about the implications of someone enlisting in the Army at this time.

"It's a lot more discussion and hand-holding, a lot more of allaying doubts and reservations," he said.

Marine officials and recruiters concur.

"Not so much since 9/11 but more in the last year," said Maj. David Griesmer, a Marine Corps spokesman. "There's a little more resistance. It's natural for a parent during a time of war to put on the brakes because nobody wants their son or daughter ..." he said, letting his thought trail off. "They're reluctant because it can be a dangerous occupation."

But the military hasn't limited its efforts at hand-holding. 

The Army and the Guard are offering the additional incentives and pressing on other initiatives. During the summer the Army launched a new "Blue to Green" campaign to get former Air Force and Navy service members to join the Army. The program has met with limited success so far, those familiar with it say.

The Army also is having young soldiers who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan return to their hometowns for two-week stints to talk with people about their combat experiences and, most important, generate leads for local recruiters.

As it tries to cast a wider net, the Army said it would take in more recruits lacking high school diplomas this fiscal year than last, lowering its target from 92 percent with diplomas to 90 percent.

The Guard, which traditionally has recruited members of the services as they departed active duty but is meeting heavier resistance there, has shifted to recruit people who never have served as well.

While the Marines are feeling some pressure too, they have not resorted to new financial incentives to make their numbers.

Experts believe the military's recruiting problems would be far greater if the Army had not resorted to its stop-loss program, which keeps soldiers in the service past the end of their enlistment terms.

"The fewer people you retain, the higher your recruiting numbers have to be,' said Charles Pena, director of defense policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. "They're interrelated. ... One of the reasons they're making their recruiting numbers is because they're not having to backfill for people who are being held in stop-loss."

Charles Moskos, Northwestern University professor emeritus and a leading military sociologist, said that besides enlisting more high school dropouts, the Army likely would rely more on private contractors to do jobs for which there aren't enough soldiers, such as transportation.

Also, "we're going to recruit more foreigners," Moskos said, adding that he understood that 3 percent of the American troops in Iraq are not U.S. citizens. He expects that percentage to rise.

Despite the snubs from parents and young people who want no part of the military at present, McClung takes heart from idealistic teenagers such as Sameer Khan, 17, a high school senior who he signed up.

Though Khan does not believe the U.S. should be in Iraq, describes his family as "well-off" and has been successful enough in school to attend college next year, he wants to be a Marine.

"It's my duty and privilege to defend this country. ... The youth today don't realize how much they have" materially and in citizens' rights, he said.

Half-Indian, Kahn said his travels to the subcontinent and Europe heightened his belief that America was worth defending.

McClung, a good-natured Texan who's been in the Marines seven years but never in combat, finishes his tour as a recruiter in less than three months. 

Then he will move to Camp Pendleton near San Diego with his wife and two young children, both of whom have epilepsy. 

There he will prepare for a tour of duty as a platoon sergeant in Afghanistan, a decision his wife was not thrilled about and one that especially upset his mother.

"When my wife and I were talking about whether I was going to re-enlist," he recalled, "that was a big part of the decision. `Hey, I can't allow these kids to go out there and do this and me not do it myself.' So that's one reason I re-enlisted."

Shane Hawes, a freshman living in the University Park's Panther Hall this semester, thought settling into his new room would be an easy move, especially when it came time to connect his computer to the general network.

"I thought everything was going to be easier here because I know they have DSL connection," he said. "Just plug in the cables and wait [for the Internet] to start."

Yet because the Department office of Information Technology Security and the University Technology Services Office have taken many security measures in response to surfacing threats throughout the FIU network, getting access to the Internet took more than Hawes thought it would.

"There were registrations, problems with the system and downloads I had to make. But I don't mind all of that, if it's keeping the computer clean," Hawes said.

By offering residential students firewalls and protected registration through UTS, the IT Security department believes it is providing an extra measure of protection to computers operating in a traditionally unsafe network zone.

"Viruses generated through e-mail are a big problem in universities," said Cheryl Lyn Granto, IT Security officer. "Students don't have anti-virus programs on their machines, or don't keep operating systems up-to-date. All machines can be compromised by just one person."

Though on-campus students usually comprise the largest computer-using population at universities, Granto realizes that threats to the system can come from any source.

The IT Security department will release a training video on their website in late February to educate the university community about various computer threats and to explain preventive measures users can take to keep the systems safe.

"The security awareness training video was made for all students, faculty, staff and anyone who does business with FIU," Granto said. "It's made up of three segments that will talk about passwords, identity theft and things people should be aware of to be better computer operators."

After the video, viewers will read a general-use policy that states that the university will hold them accountable for their actions on the network.

While trying to curb the potential release of new viruses into the general system, FIU will tackle the ongoing threat of identity theft as well.

"Identity theft is rampant, not just at FIU but around the world," Granto said. "A lot of that happens because people don't use appropriate passwords, and then people get into your account."

According to Granto, a major cause for this increase in identity theft is the use of private numbers as passwords around the school.

"In an academic institution where social security numbers are sometimes used, that's usually a problem. If someone has your number, they have your identity pretty much," she said.

Granto believes FIU's new computer security efforts have alleviated the situation.

"The new Panthersoft system has helped by going away from using social security numbers," she said.

After implementing Panthersoft, the FIU General Council formed a committee to eliminate the use of social security numbers outside designated places (such as forms needed to enroll in the university), so that the primary means of identification will now be the Panther ID.

As the year and a new semester begin, the IT Security offices will continue to carry out plans to create a safer computer network for both FIU campuses.

"Spam is also a problem, and we're trying to get a mail gateway that would screen all mail before it goes through," Granto said.

An alliance is in the works with Cisco Systems, the international networking company, to provide university with physical hardware, such as firewalls and intrusion detectors. Also in the works is a program entitled Cisco Secure Agent, a personal firewall for desktops needed in public IP spaces.

Before FIU can implement this technology, it must find the money to fund it.

The spam gateway itself would cost between $100,000 and $200,000, and the Cisco programs would cost between $20,000,000 and $25,000,000.

"It would be great if we could get started in 2005, but I'm sure we won't really be seeing things happen until 2006. That's why we've spread out our strategy into a six-year plan," Granto says.

For now, the IT Security offices will continue to aid students any way they can, whether it be providing firewall information or internships to students interested in pursuing information technology careers.

"There's a lot of bad stuff out there, but that's what we do, try to make people aware of those things and how not to let that affect their lives," Granto said.

Headline: Ringtones perking up record industry's bottom line
Author: Daniel Rubin/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
PHILADELPHIA -When Itai Adi's friend Maria is calling, his cell phone lets him know by playing the Black Eyed Peas' "Let's Get It Started."

Calls from other friends of the high school senior might prompt "Toxic" by Britney Spears, G Unit's "Stunt 101," or Usher's "My Boo" to ring, depending on his mood.

And when his family is on the line?

"I try to find an annoying ring for them," says Adi, 17, who by latest count had downloaded 30 songs to ring on his cell phone, paying as much as $1.49 a shot. "It could either be a song I don't like, or, since you can also download noises, it could be a bird that squawks really loud."

It's all sweet music to the ears of the downbeat record industry. Since catching on late last year, ringtones have exploded in popularity, producing an estimated $375 million in U.S. revenue this year, according to IDC, an information technology firm. The year before: only $18 million. Worldwide sales are far bigger, particularly in Asia and Europe.

Billboard magazine, known for charting most popular songs, introduced a ringtones category in November - one that, not surprisingly, echoes the most popular singles.

The Billboard Music Awards last month picked its first Ringtone of the Year Award. It was rapper 50 Cent for "In Da Club."

Meanwhile, ringtones are becoming their own art form. 

BlingTones has signed hip-hop artists and producers such as Q-Tip, Rockwilder, Denaun Porter, Salaam Remi and Hi-Tek to create original 30-second "pieces" available only through its service. It calls itself the world's first wireless record label.

A personalized ring "is an identity statement," says Lewis Ward, an analyst with IDC. Many phones allow users to associate different songs with different callers. "It says something about you to yourself and to your peers."

For those who think ringtones are like, so last year, how about ringbacks? They're more like next year.

Ringbacks are songs or noises other people will hear when they call you, while they're waiting for you to answer your phone. Instead of rrring, rrring, rrring, they could be hearing barnyard noises, Beastie Boys tunes or Beethoven. The owner of the phone gets to decide what callers will hear.

Ringbacks are so popular in India - where big sellers are Bollywood tunes and celebrities' voices - that within a half-year of their July introduction, more than one in 10 mobile-phone users had them.

In December, T-Mobile launched the first U.S. ringback service. Verizon Wireless is test-marketing them in some western U.S. markets for $1 a month, plus $1.99 for each ringback song used. Sprint is expected to launch its service early next year.

There is a rush to roll out better-sounding songs and crisper cell phone speakers - and for good reason. One industry analyst, Ovum, estimates that by 2008 cell phone ringtones, ringbacks and songs could account for 28 percent of all music sales, including CDs and legitimate downloads. Companies see great opportunity in allowing people to shop for, buy, save and play songs on cell phones.

"We are seeing the development of a new channel for the delivery of digital music on wireless devices," said Ward of IDC.

In the United States, most fans of ringtones are under age 25. They pay between $1 and $3 for a sample of a favorite song - generally the better it sounds, the more it costs.

In this country, most shop for ringtones by phone, downloading them from their carriers. Elsewhere, phone customers are more likely to go to third-party Web sites for their rings.

The fastest-growing part of the trend - and the one the music biz puts most hope in - are called Master Tones or Real Music ringtones, which have mp3 clarity.

Unlike the cheaper ringtones - think Mozart's 40th played with one finger - these are digital samples of the song, vocals and all. The industry likes the master tracks because they can sell for $3, three times as much as an entire downloaded song on music Web sites. And the artist gets royalties.

"If you have that hip, Snoop Dogg audio clip when you pick up the phone, you're going to be that much cooler - at least, that is the hope," Ward said.

Headline: British chef captures 'culinary nostalgia'
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While most people claim that there are certain songs, sounds, or smells that, when casually experienced, remind them of some important event in their lives, I always found it strange that I experience the same nostalgia whenever I think of ... food.

Apparently - and happily - I am not the only one to associate food and taste with past experiences.

Nigel Slater, a popular British chef and cookbook author, manages to brilliantly portray that feeling of culinary nostalgia in his childhood memoirs "Toast: The Story of a Boy's Hunger."

Written in simple, direct prose, the book begins with Slater's earliest memories and ends in his late adolescence, after he graduates from a culinary academy. 

Though there are no chapter divisions, each section of the book focuses on a memory and is headed by the name of an edible product somehow associated with that memory. In the first section, "Toast," Slater describes happy recollections of his mother buttering burnt bread for his breakfast.

However, the whole book does not deal entirely with cuisine. Part of the hunger mentioned in the autobiography's title is Slater's struggle to gain the acceptance of his father. He is a middle-class factory owner, constantly disappointed with the young Slater's "pansy" attitude, as he attempts to turn his son into a man.

Though Slater's mother provides him with a sort of comfort and silent friendship as a child by making sure he always has a good meal to eat even though she hates working in the kitchen, that security is broken in the middle of the book when she dies of lung disease.

Soon afterward, Slater's father, a stern man unable to share his bereavement with his sons, begins a scandalous relationship with the family's cleaning woman which eventually results in their marriage.

Throughout the rest of the book, the young Slater seems to be competing with this woman for the affection of his father, a race that ends in the kitchen. 

Learning how to cook to please his father isn't the only thing the boy must worry about. As he enters his teenage years, Slater's second hunger begins to manifest itself as he battles with sex and all the feelings of guilt it brings. From masturbation to voyeurism, from his first girlfriend to occasional homosexual experiences, Slater keeps no secrets as he explains that his sexuality was as much a part of his growing up as any other event in his life.

Though never somber or overdramatic, Slater manages to capture his experiences with death, separation, love and anxiety with enough melancholy and nostalgia to make readers feel as though they lived through the moments his memoirs describe.

The book's only drawback would be to American readers unfamiliar with many of the British foods to which Slater refers. But the American edition carries a glossary which explains delicacies such as treacle, sponge, and bourbon biscuits.

Food, however, is an experience that binds everyone. We eat when we're sad, lonely, happy or just relaxed. In his book, Slater creatively serves readers the memories of his formative years reflected on the dinner plate.

Headline: Real Steve Zissou deeply attached to his name
Author: Robert K. Elder/Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
In the end credits of Wes Anderson's "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou," there's an acknowledgement that Steve Zissou (played by Bill Murray) is a real person.

No, it's not a joke.

Though writer/director Anderson ("The Royal Tenenbaums," "Rushmore") made the name up, the script clearance department at Buena Vista Pictures found a real Steve Zissou. 

This Zissou is a federal criminal trial lawyer based in Bay Side, N.Y., not a burned-out underwater explorer.

"When I found out it was part of the title, I was a little annoyed. It's a unique name, and I really didn't want to share it," says Zissou, 49, but he observes he had few legal options because Anderson's film wasn't directly about him.

"They could have made a movie about a New York lawyer who was an anti-Semitic terrorist pedophile, and I still couldn't do anything about it," Zissou says. "If it's about the real Steve Zissou, then maybe you have a shot, but then you have to prove damages."

Perhaps to be on the safe side, the movie studio negotiated with Zissou over use of his distinctive name. He declines to answer questions about the agreement's confidential terms except to say he is acknowledged as a New York attorney in the film credits.

T. Ernest Freeman, a Houston-based entertainment attorney, says obtaining permissions "really gets down to due diligence."

"The question is, if it's a private citizen, would the person whose name is being used be readily identifiable? It's a subjective test applied to the movie," Freeman says.

Case in point: Eleven years after Richard Linklater's cult hit "Dazed and Confused" opened in theaters, a trio of Texans (Andy Slater, Bobby Wooderson, Richard "Pink" Floyd) is suing the filmmaker and Universal Studios Inc. for "defamation" and "negligent infliction of emotional distress." 

The suit claims that Linklater did not obtain permission to use the names of former high school acquaintances in his film.

Freeman, who is representing the plaintiffs in that litigation, says in the case of Steve Zissou, New York attorney, the studio's legal department was probably playing it safe by crossing the t's and dotting the i's, he says. "Any diligent studio would make sure there wouldn't be a problem."

Zissou's stepmother, Mary Zissou of Lakeside, Calif., was married to Stavros "Steve" Zissou for nearly 35 years before his death in 2000. 

When she first saw the movie trailer and the title of the film, "I thought I was losing my mind completely," she says. "I thought it was the most not-possible thing that would ever happen."

She says she didn't know her stepson was listed in the film credits.

"Well that little rascal, he never told me," she says.

Despite his original discomfort at the thought of his unique name being used in a movie, "it's been, to my surprise, a lot of fun," Zissou says. "And I think Bill Murray is America's greatest living actor."

Subheadline: iPod finally receives tough competition from new gadget
Author: Michelle Ferrer / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Pat Conroy, the author of "The Great Santini" once said, "Without music life is a journey through a desert." A life without music would be dull. Imagine turning on your TV and watching silent Gap commercials or going to the movies and watching Jude Law and Natalie Portman in "Closer" without the hit-theme song, "Blower's Daughter." 

Recently, iRiver and Apple iPod MP3 players have filled our world with song. These portable devices fit in your pocket and fill your day with your favorite tunes.  

Since the end of the holidays, you can hardly go anywhere without seeing the signature, white Apple earphones or an MP3 player secured on to someone's belt. 

"They are great. I like that I can have like, what would take up five CDs, in such a compact item," said sophomore Daniel Convers, the proud owner of a new 20 GB iPod.

The Apple 20 GB iPod can hold up to 5,000 songs and supports AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible, AIFF, Apple Lossless and WAV files. Its battery life is around 12 hours when fully charged (each charge takes about 4 hours) - a long battery life for such a small device. The Apple iPods are compatible with Mac OS X or Windows 2000/XP. This nifty little device will cost you around $299. 

Seem a bit pricey? You may like to try out the Apple 4 GB iPod mini. This is a more compact MP3 player and comes in a wide variety of colors. It can hold up to 1,000 songs for your daily use. 

However, the mini has an eight hour battery life on a three-hour charge. Both iPods come equipped with a standard click wheel, AC adapter and Fire wire USB cords.  

If you are looking for an MP3 player that can hold a few more songs, or simply looking for something other than an Apple product, you may want to take a look at the new iRiver MP3 players. iRiver is a fairly new to the market and hasn't been widely advertised. 

However, it is rather impressive.  

The new iRiver H320 model comes with a large, vivid color screen, supports transfers from Windows Media Player, JPEG and BMP images, and has a battery life of 16 hours. 

Additionally, iRiver uses a drag and drop system instead of the Apple iTunes software to download music. It also has a built-in joystick instead of a click wheel.

All iRiver players come equipped with an integrated voice recorder and a built-in FM tuner. The total cost is $315, a mere $15 more than an Apple Ipod.  

The iRiver comes with earphones, a carrying case, USB 2.0 cables, audio line-in cables, AC adapters and a leather carrying case.

Whether you prefer the sleek-looking Apple iPods or the color iRiver, MP3 gadgets are the way of the future. 

More and more products are constantly coming out in the market place, and it's only a matter of time before everyone has one.
