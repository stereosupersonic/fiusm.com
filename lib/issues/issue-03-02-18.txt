Headline: Raising Victor Vargas lets audiences down
Author: Claudia Ortega / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Sometimes the gritty, homemade movie feel is a fitting backdrop for a film, sometimes the absence of a soundtrack really makes strong dialogue stand out, and sometimes bad actors don't detract from the film itself. Unfortunately, none of that is true for "Raising Victor Vargas."

The movie, touted as a coming of age comedy, is set in a New York Dominican neighborhood and follows the title character as he tries to redeem himself in the eyes of all his unforgiving, judgmental peers. He has succumbed to his hormones and committed an act that could possibly make him a pariah for the rest of...a week? A month? How long before someone else screws up and they all turn their attention to that person? He obviously doesn't see it that way however, and sets out to conquer Judy, the prettiest and also hardest girl to get.  

Throw in a psychotic grandmother, an annoying sister and a little brother - whose grandmother babies so much he can't even take a bath by himself - and you get a coming of age comedy.

I guess the filmmaker was trying to make a point about strong girls and the weak boys who love them; all three girls are determined that they don't need "a man" and therefore won't stand for any of the games that the boys in their neighborhood play (if I lived in that neighborhood I'd probably declare life-long celibacy). The movie soon shows that the girls are just as susceptible to love as the boys and the roles shift.

The characters are as real as they get (with the exception of the grandmother), and therefore have nothing interesting to say - who comes up with witty banter at 16?  However, the actors can't even get these easy parts down. Sometimes, they seem totally natural in their environment, but more often than not it feels more like a "Babysitters Club" video than a serious indie.  

The only person worth noting is Judy Marte who played Judy. I got the impression that she was on a whole other level compared to the rest of the cast.  She's pretty and mysterious; unlike the other characters who are, in her words, "so easy to see through it's embarrassing," you never really know what motivates Judy.  Her confession at the end of the movie leaves you wanting more because we never learn why. 

Other than Judy, the grandmother was the only other person who stood out. Now, I'm not Dominican, but I'm pretty sure that Dominican grandmothers are not that different from grandmothers from other Latin American countries. 

In a movie that's trying to be so real, the grandmother takes it a little too far. We all know they're overprotective and conservative, but this woman is crazy; it's like she's raising three little Norman Bateses.

At the end of the movie, Victor seems to grow up and the grandmother seems to let go. It just wasn't satisfying though. He makes his grandmother a sandwich and unlocks the phone, his brother sits down to play the piano, and his sister finally calls Judy's brother.  But I didn't really care - actually I almost missed the symbolism of the scene, because I was bored already. 

From the empty Café Bustelo cans used for baths, to the plastic covering on the couch, the movie does a pretty good job of creating the right environment (they probably just borrowed somebody's apartment). What happens between the teenagers is pretty realistic also, but it's just not that interesting.  

"Coming of age story" is just a term they use for a movie about teenagers that doesn't go anywhere, and it's not a comedy - most of the time I was laughing because the acting was deplorable. 

The home-video quality could have been enhanced by some interesting camera angles or some artistic composition, and the little bit of music, which was actually really good, should have been present more often. 

Despite everything I said though, I realized the next day that I could relate to the film and I guess that's its redeeming value.  But that doesn't cover up for everything else; it's still lacking.  In the end, I think I could have made a better "coming of age comedy" by setting up a hidden camera at the Sunset Place or at  a local's only show.

Headline: Carlos Saura works to be honored
Author: Claudia Ortega / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Type "Carlos Saura" into a search engine like Google and you'll get about 43,000 hits. Unfortunately, most of them are in foreign languages.  

This is an example of how, with the overwhelming dominance of mundane, badly-made Hollywood movies, indies and especially foreign films are neglected in the United States; often, we don't even about them and when we do it's a long time after they have already been released (unless, of course, you live in New York). 

Luckily, we have the Miami International Film Festival (MIFF) to thank for introducing us to movies and directors we would otherwise never get the chance to see.  Carlos Saura and his latest film, "Salome," is the best example.

As festival director Nicole Guillemet said in a prepared statement, "The name Carlos Saura is synonymous with the intelligence and passion that is so often associated with Spanish film." This is why he has been selected as the recipient of the MIFF's first Career Achievement Tribute.

He is known in the United States for his portrayal of the passion of dance. 

His films "Flamenco" (1995) and "Tango" (1998) are the only ones widely and readily available (check out Blockbuster), making them the most well-known of his work. 

While "Flamenco" is just a collection of musicians and dancers performing various styles of flamenco, "Tango" is basically a stage-door musical; the main character is making the definitive film about tango when his girlfriend leaves him. The plot is designed to let the dancing drive the film.

In 1986, he made "El Amor Brujo" - the third of a "flamenco trilogy" which included "Boda de Sangre" (1981) and "Carmen" (1983) - a film version of the legendary Manuel de Falla's ballet in which a woman and the man she loves must perform the "Danza del Fuego" to overcome the power her dead husband still wields over her. 

As a flamenco dancer, these are, understandably, some of my favorite Saura films to watch, but not all of the 37 films he has made are about flamenco or even dancing.

His first film, "La Tarde del Domingo," was a short made upon his graduation from the Escuela Oficial de Cinematografia and came out in 1956. Realizing he needed creative control after a disappointing "Llanto por un Bandido" (1964), he teamed up with a producer who allowed him the freedom he wanted. It was during this time that the movies which many regard as his best came out.

 They all centered on social commentary of Franco's regime. Although critical of the government, he was never banned because of the acclaim he was winning in the international film festivals for himself and Spain.

His work also shows the influences of the Italian Neo-realists and that of his mentor, Luis Buñuel. In 2001, he made "Buñuel y la Mesa del Rey Salomón," whose plot includes not only the legendary filmmaker, but also Federico Garcia Lorca and Salvador Dali, all three giants of Spanish art. 

The surrealism which Buñuel and Dali used in films like "Un Chien Andalou" is often present in Saura's work. 

Although many people love this technique and the references he often makes to film history, many are turned off by it. 

Born in Huesca, Spain in 1932 to a lawyer and a pianist, Saura's first artistic interest (after a brief stint with engineering) was photography. His brother Antonio, who became a well-known abstract expressionist painter, was the one who suggested Saura study film. 

As a freelance photographer, he became well known for his portraits of dancers and musicians - this love resurfacing in his later films - and you can still see these photographs on his official web site.

The Career Achievement Tribute to Carlos Saura, which will include clips from some of his films as well as a question and answer session with a noted film critic and the audience, will be on Wednesday, Feb. 26 at 7:00 p.m. 

The $20 ticket will also include the North American premiere of his latest film, "Salome."  Looking back on the body of work that Saura has created, the artistry and passion that he has conveyed, the social statements he has made, and the influence he has had not only in Spain but internationally, I believe the festival couldn't have picked a better filmmaker to honor with this award. 

Many critics insolently say that in order to love Saura you must first love and understand flamenco and the history of Spain and her artists; but that isn't true, to love Saura you just have to love art and film.

Headline: Festival showcases variety

&nbsp;
For twenty years, the Miami International Film Festival has brought the South Florida community real artwork in cinema. Film festivals, like Sundance or Cannes, offer a wonderful opportunity to see the real movies that won't ever run alongside a theater's commercial lineup. There's always something exciting going on at the Miami International Film Festival: new talent and veteran directors with riveting films, national premieres, truthful documentaries, open panel discussions, free beach side screenings, even animated films make an appearance. What the film festival is known most for, though, is its dedication to foreign films bringing together an appreciation for both North American and international cinema.

This year the festival has a new director, Nicole Guillemet. This former co-director of the renowned Sundance Film Festival in Utah replaced last year's director, David Poland. Hopefully Guillemet's programming will surpass and make up for the 2002 festival, which flopped in comparison to past programs. Guillemet has also given FIU a larger participation in the festival activities. Six of the festival's films will be shown, with free admission for FIU students, at the University Park campus before the festival officially starts this Friday.  

The Miami International Film Festival's competitive side is divided into two categories, 15 films in the dramatic feature competition and 10 films in the documentary feature competition.  Each category will give two awards, the Grand Jury Prize and the FedEx Express Audience Award. 

In the dramatic feature category first or second-time directors from all over the world are showing their films, many of which have ran at other festivals. "Raising Victor Vargas" from America, "Benzina" from Italy and "Les Diables (The Devils)" from France and Spain are just some of the many in the drama group. 

The documentary feature competition features films like "Gabriel Orozco" from Mexico, "Ônibus 174" from Brazil and "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls" from the United States.

Some of the biggest names in cinema are to highlight several films in the premiering category. These films are not in competition but are making their national debut here in Miami. Acclaimed actor John Malkovich makes his directorial debut with "The Dancer Upstairs."  One of the biggest movies in Spain this year, "The Other Side of the Bed," makes it's sexy premiere at the Miami International Film Festival. Audrey Tautou from "Amélie" stars in "High Fidelity" director Stephen Fears' British thriller, "Dirty Pretty Things." In another Spanish film, Penelope Cruz stars with Gael Garcia Bernal("Y Tu Mamá Tambien") in "Don't Tempt Me," a comical satire. 

The Australian film, "Till the Human Voices Wake Us," starring Guy Pearce and Helena Bonham Carter also makes its debut at the film festival. These along with several other films make up the premiering slot of the Miami International Film Festival.

There is another non-competitive group of officially selected films, a category that represents the best of international cinema. The widely popular showcases at the Miami International Film Festival.  

A couple of Russian films, "House of Fools" and "The Lover," are showing alongside several Argentinean films like "Historias Mínimas" and "Un Oso Rojo (A Red Bear)."

The special screenings portion of the Miami International Film Festival looks like the most interesting segment. A segment of sports-inspired films, "long-short" films, "Eden," an animated premiere from Poland, and a few other sub-categories which will be sure to feature something for everyone.

Four musically related films are scheduled to screen at Nikki Beach. The Talking Heads' concert film, "Stop Making Sense," the classic '50s musical "Grease," John Waters' comedic musical "Hairspray," and the cross-dressing classic "Victor/Victoria." 

The various programs this year's festival has to offer will be sure to entertain as well as promote cinematic appreciation. 

The Miami International Film Festival can be a very enriching experience, even for those who've never delved into the more artsy side of film. 

Take it as an opportunity to depart from the usual Hollywood repertoire and catch some real talent at work; these are the films that really matter.

Headline: Heights bring sincerity to indie style
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Any schmuck with a big budget and a studio can call him or herself a director, but it takes a real artist to create a film. Appearing at the Miami Film Festival is Latino filmmaker Alfredo de Villa's first full-length feature film, "Washington Heights."

"Washington Heights" is the story of a struggling young comic book artist named Carlos.  His artistic abilities have reached a standstill and he grows frustrated with each rejection. Determined to make it in the world of comics, Carlos keeps drawing until fate intervenes and his father, Eddie, owner of a small neighborhood bodega,  is shot during an attempted burglary. Carlos is forced to temporarily set aside his dream and run the bodega. He still finds time to draw, and it is the experiences and harsh realities he is faced with that finally inspire him to create a comic worthy of recognition. 

Right away, one can really breathe in the reality of this film and get a sense for its independently produced atmosphere. This gives it an extremely personal touch and as an audience, we can really connect with de Villa and his intentions as a filmmaker. 

It's a pretty sound and well-balanced film. The script is lively and uses a dialogue that is precise and realistic. The actors must also be commended for their excellent portrayals. We can really connect with the angry Carlos and his ailing father. 

The soundtrack is another wonderful compliment: a predominantly Cuban-themed score that captures the heart of the Latino neighborhood and the culture of the main characters. 

Being an amateur film, it does have its faults.  A few cuts here or there reveal sloppy editing, there are also a few parts of the story we could've done without and  blur the main goal of the central character, Carlos. These things are very minimal and its grass roots feeling puts you on the same level as the filmmakers.

If you can't take my word for it, "Washington Heights" has the awards to prove itself as a great film; it's won various awards at six other film festivals, an impressive feat. 

I don't expect it to win best film, but it will definitely be turning heads, which is something the filmmakers should be very proud and excited of, especially since it's de Villa's first full-length feature. Hopefully this is the stepping stone into a future of fantastic work for de Villa, his talent is obvious and shows infinite potential.

Headline: Biscayne Bay renovations continue
Author: John Morris/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Biscayne Bay Campus has undergone several moves and renovations recently, including the new Marine Biology lab construction and the moving of the Campus Life office from the third floor of the Wolfe University Center to the first.  There are more changes scheduled at BBC, including the food court and fitness center moving to the first floor. 

"These plans have been in the works for a few years now," Greg Olson, Wolfe University Center director, said.

Food Services also plans to offer vegetarian cuisine.

"The plans are underway, and the veggie bar will open across from the Oasis next month," said Arthur Sternberg, BBC food service director. 	

The Parking and Traffic department will move from the first floor to the old Campus Life office on the third floor next month, while WUC's administrative office will move to the current Parking and Traffic office.

There are two major projects in store for WUC.   First, the food court, which is currently located on the second floor, will move to the first floor at the entrance of WUC from Academic I, complete with new vendors - and consequently, new options for diners.

These vendors will include Bené's Pizza, which will serve pizza and different types of pasta; a new grill with an expanded menu; and World's Fair which will offer a different cultured theme each day.  

The new food court will also have upgraded facilities and equipment, which will benefit both customers and staff.  

"We are looking forward to the new food court," Sternberg said.  

Olson expects the new food court's groundbreaking to happen sometime this fall, with the grand opening scheduled in spring 2005.

Also in the works is the groundbreaking for the new fitness center, which will be located on the first floor of WUC, just outside the pool area.  This will connect the fitness center with the pool deck, offering easier access to both facilities. 

The new fitness center will be larger, so it will be able to hold more equipment. In the current fitness center there is no room for new equipment because of the limited area. 

The new fitness center will be more visible than the current one, which is located on the third floor of WUC.

 "I had no idea there was a gym here," junior Gena Versanne said about the current center. 

The new center will also include an aerobics studio, which will be able to accommodate more and larger aerobics classes, as well as other programs.

All the renovations will total more than $3 million, Olson said.  "This money is funded by the Capital Improvement Trust Fund and will not be at any cost to the students," Olson said.

Junior Vanessa Iglesia is concerned that the renovation process will cause inconveniences.

 "I like the idea, but until the gym and food court are finished, it will cause hassle on the first floor," she said.

Headline: Dance studios in disrepair
Subheadline: Studio repairs force dance students to take classes off campus
Author: By Geannina Munizaga/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Roof damage to the studios and a lack of space have forced University Park dance majors off campus, and students said administrators' explanations for the situation don't hold up.

Since the beginning of the semester, dance classes have been split between VH 100 and studios at the Roxy Performing Arts Center, located across 107th Avenue in the shopping center behind a Wendy's.

Dance students at University Park have had to drive across the street to take classes because of roof damages incurred at the W-6 studio, located on the west side of campus.

Jillian Torgas, director of dance at Roxy Performing Arts Center, said FIU Dance Director Thomas Haygood contacted the studio in early January when repairs began and inquired about space availability.

 "After [the first] couple of weeks, various classes were moved to the center," Torgas said. Haygood declined to comment about the situation. 

During performances, the department has access to the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, which has fully equipped stages and theaters adequate to dancers' needs.

W-6 is one of the university's oldest buildings still standing. Before FIU opened it was a mechanical storage room.

"The building should be bulldozed," Leslie Neal, associate professor of dance, said. "The roof leaks. It sits on a flood area and when [FIU] received harsh rain a few years ago, the studio was completely flooded. Three inches of rainwater covered the floor and it had to be replaced."

But when repairs are finished, Neal said the current facilities still wouldn't meet dancers' needs.

"It would be more economic to replace the building entirely instead of playing catch-up trying to fix things all the time. But it's hard to get access to funds to provide [adequate] facilities unless you have a financial sponsor," Neal said. "Which we don't have."

According to Neal, FIU's dance facilities simply don't compare to similar programs across the nation. The studios - which lack important essentials like adequate floors, ample studio space, high-quality sound equipment and access to video equipment - don't even measure up to those of other Miami-based dance programs, both public and private.  

"W6 is not the greatest space for dance, but it's all we have in addition to VH 100. We may have to eliminate some classes we currently offer in tap, ballroom and jazz... At this time during the current budget crunch, there is no money for new facilities," Leroy Clark, head chair of the Department of Theater and Dance, said.

Rachel Carroll, a sophomore taking dance classes at UP, is outraged by the situation.

"It's convenient that there was some place to go, but it's ridiculous that we have to go off campus to take classes," Carroll said.

"[Dancers] feel like we really don't matter. It's like we're extra majors who don't have a building of our own," said Torgas, who is also a senior in the dance program.

In the meantime, students enrolled in ballet, modern dance, tap and flamenco must attend class at the Roxy Performing Arts Center. Of the seven studios at the Roxy center, three are designed specifically for dance. The other four are dedicated to thespian classes, including a fully equipped theater for performances. 

Torgas said the facilites at Roxy  offer dancers a sense of community lacking at FIU.

"It's been great. There are no problems with space, the studios are huge, and there's plenty of parking," Torgas said. "At UP dancers are spread out and the only way you get to know someone is if you've taken the same classes during the semesters. A lot of students don't want to go back [to taking classes on campus]."

Students said the department has not told them when the situation will be resolved, they have only said "meet at Roxy's until further notice." 

"It's really sad, considering that [FIU] offers a BFA in Dance and yet the university doesn't provide facilities," says Julie Colombino, a senior in the program. "We never receive any athletic training for our muscles. We don't even have access to ice for injuries or fatigue. I've been here for four years and nothing has changed."

Headline: Una mirada a Latinoamérica
Subheadline: Robert Valencia
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;

Muchos de los que vivimos en los Estados Unidos vemos a una Latinoamérica convulsionada por sus problemas políticos, sociales y económicos. Sin embargo, para comprender el presente y entender los problemas que aquejan a esa región, debemos darle una mirada al pasado. 

Y es que los problemas que aquejan a Latinoamérica han marginado su nivel de competencia y participación en el mundo. Una consecuencia lógica es la poca atención de los Estados Unidos sobre la región. 

Eduardo Gamarra, director del Centro Latinoamericano y del Caribe de FIU (LACC, por sus siglas en inglés) afirma que &#8220;Latinoamérica nunca ha sido importante para los Estados Unidos&#8221;.

A su juicio, a partir de la Doctrina Monroe, adoptada en 1823, Estados Unidos ha tenido el concepto del &#8220;backyard&#8221; o patio trasero sobre Latinoamérica, ya que no la considera como una región de importancia económica, sino una zona de relevancia estratégica.

La pirómana y los bomberos

Gamarra explica la falta de atención de los Estados Unidos hacia Latinoamérica mediante una comparación con el juego vicioso de los pirómanos y los bomberos.  

En este caso, Latinoamérica es la pirómana y los Estados Unidos, el bombero. ¿La razón? La única manera en la que América Latina puede atraer la atención del gigante del norte es &#8220;prendiendo el fuego&#8221; para que la primera potencia mundial lo pueda apagar. Sin embargo, opina Gamarra, este reclamo de atención por parte de Latinoamérica crea un juego poco saludable.

Por otro lado, muchos creen que América Latina está abierta a la inversión norteamericana. Pero Gamarra opina lo contrario, ya que &#8220;nunca ha sido un área de inversión monetaria  ni aun con la apertura comercial&#8221;.

Pero dentro de cinco años, América Latina será un área de igual o mayor importancia &#8211;comparada con Europa y Japón- en cuanto al tema comercial. 

Hoy día, México es uno de los países latinoamericanos con quien Estados Unidos mantiene una relación económica activa actualmente, debido a la inestabilidad reinante en los bloques económicos en el cono sur, dice Gamarra. 

El explica el fenómeno con dos razones fundamentales. La primera es que el 50 por ciento de la inversión extranjera en el hemisferio ingresa al país azteca. En segundo lugar, aproximadamente 22 millones de mexicanos viven en los Estados Unidos, lo que convierte a México no solamente en un actor en el contexto internacional, sino en un actor nacional. 

La deteriorada democracia

Gamarra añade que, en los últimos años, lo que más ha llamado la atención sobre América Latina es el surgimiento de gobiernos de izquierda, por ejemplo las nuevas administraciones de Brasil, Venezuela y Ecuador, &#8220;el supuesto eje del mal latinoamericano&#8221;. 

Gamarra no comparte la definición de &#8220;eje del mal&#8221;, término adoptado por la administración de George W. Bush para catalogar a &#8220;los buenos y los malos&#8221;.    

Gamarra prefiere hacer una alusión a la analogía de los pirómanos y los bomberos.

&#8220;Los de la izquierda, en especial los comunistas, prendían el fuego en diferentes partes para echarle en cara a los Estados Unidos la situación que estaban pasando&#8221;, afirma. 

Para nadie es un secreto que Latinoamérica sufre una situación precaria debido a las inadecuadas políticas adoptadas. Estas han conducido a una concentración de las riquezas y a una corrupción espeluznante.  

&#8220;Lo mas triste de todo es que este patrón de desarrollo ha sido de alguna manera apoyado por los Estados Unidos&#8221;,  dice Gamarra. 

En las últimas décadas, los candidatos a las presidencias en los países latinoamericanos adoptaron el dogma de las promesas falsas. Chávez, en Venezuela, y Fujimori, en Perú, han movido millones de personas pobres para que apoyen sus campañas, con promesas de un mejoramiento en la calidad de vida. Sin embargo, como dice Gamarra, &#8220;una vez está en el poder, el candidato, de derecha o de izquierda, nunca cumple sus promesas&#8221;.  

Una de las causas principales de estas promesas falsas es la falta de legitimidad en sistemas políticos desgastados. Gamarra afirma que tal es el caso de Hugo Chávez. 

&#8220;Chávez llegó a la presidencia con el 60 por ciento del voto, cambió la constitución con un apoyo popular enorme. Hoy, esa misma gente que apoyó a Chávez es la que está en su contra,&#8221; dice.

Protagonismo con sabor a samba

Para Gamarra, las reformas &#8220;izquierdistas&#8221; de Chávez han influido en cierta manera en el presidente brasileño Lula Da Silva, considerado también un líder de la izquierda. 

&#8220;Creo que no deberíamos enfocarnos tanto en eso. Si miramos mejor su primer mes como presidente, tengamos por seguro que será una administración interesante&#8221;,  dice Gamarra. 

Agrega que Lula Da Silva está siguiendo los pasos de su antecesor Fernando Enrique Cardozo en el tema económico.

&#8220;Es un tipo que está tratando de mantener una estructura económica y planteando, a la misma vez, la necesidad de que internacionalmente haya una respuesta al problema de la pobreza&#8221;, dice Gamarra.

Brasil ha adoptado cierto protagonismo dentro de la región, ya que quiere solucionar por la vía fácil los problemas que acosan a Venezuela y porque no le conviene tener vecinos peligrosos, asegura Gamarra. 

Colombia: ¿una bomba de tiempo?

No solamente la administración de Bill Clinton consideraba a Colombia como &#8220;el foco de infección del hemisferio&#8221; sino también los educadores, el Pentágono, los centros de seguridad y las agencias federales norteamericanas.  

No obstante, Gamarra asevera que Colombia no representa un peligro para la región, sino un problema interno. 

&#8220;La única manera en que Colombia puede afectar a la región es por medio de sus zonas fronterizas con Panamá, Perú, Venezuela, Ecuador y Brasil&#8221;, afirma Gamarra, &#8220;pero llegar a desestabilizar enormemente la región es una conclusión muy apresurada&#8221;, puntualiza. 

Pero no hay que dejar de lado los problemas que ocurren dentro de la sociedad colombiana. Su democracia se ha debilitado por los actos vandálicos de las guerrillas y las autodefensas, lo que hace aún más dura la supervivencia para los ciudadanos. 

Gamarra hace alusión a las seudoparticipaciones de la guerrilla en diferentes aspectos latinoamericanos.

&#8220;Estando en este país es muy fácil decir que la guerrilla (colombiana) financia al gobierno Boliviano, que tiene vínculos en el Ecuador y que tiene una estrecha relación con Chávez, pero faltan evidencias para que todas estas afirmaciones se concreten&#8221;, dice.

El colapso argentino

Hasta hace algunos años, Argentina era considerada &#8220;la vitrina de Latinoamérica para el mundo&#8221;, ya que había seguido ciertos patrones para el control de la inflación, las mejoras a su economía y la privatización.  

A pesar de tener las herramientas necesarias para una conducción correcta de la economía, los problemas de manejo administrativo jugaron un papel importante.  

&#8220;En el contexto argentino aparece lo siguiente: el neoliberalismo y las malas políticas han llevado a la concentración de riquezas y, por lo tanto, la política es la que tiene la culpa. Se hubiera podido implantar la doctrina Marxista en Argentina, pero en la administración de Menem había mucha corrupción. El neoliberalismo corrupto fue lo que llevó a Argentina a un colapso económico&#8221;, afirma Gamarra.

Gutiérrez: ¿el otro Chávez?

Lucio Gutiérrez es el recién elegido presidente de Ecuador. Pero algunos no lo recuerdan con admiración, ya que fue parte de un golpe de estado. Esto lo pone &#8220;del lado de los izquierdistas&#8221; junto con Fidel Castro, Hugo Chávez y Lula Da Silva. 

No obstante, Gamarra ve con esperanzas la nueva administración de Gutiérrez.

&#8220;Las primeras acciones del presidente Gutiérrez han sido sorprendentes, han sido decisiones no vinculadas al neoliberalismo ni a la izquierda irresponsable. Hay que darle tiempo a Gutiérrez para ver como maneja su administración&#8221;, afirma.  

Sin embargo, algunas de sus políticas pueden causarle problemas con sus simpatizantes, quienes a largo o corto plazo podrían irse en su contra.

&#8220;Lo lamentable es que si llegan a irse en contra de estas políticas, estaremos perdiendo la oportunidad de ver cómo la izquierda en América Latina puede manejar administraciones responsables. Tengo la esperanza fija en Lula, que pueda ser un presidente responsable, una izquierda responsable&#8221;, concluye Gamarra.

Headline: Students protest in Tallahassee
Author: Rene Diaz Iturrey/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
More than 100 FIU students protested against the possible elimination of the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program at the capitol building in Tallahassee Feb. 13.  

The students rallied along with more than 500 students from other Florida state universities including members of the Florida Student Association, who organized the rally. 

"I'm proud of students coming out," Ron L. Greenstein, Broward County district 95 state representative, said. 

He said that the Bright Futures Program "is important to maintain the way it is" because it is "the only middle class tax break." 

Jessica Morffi, University Park Student Government Council president, was one of the speakers at the rally.

"We come here to say that Bright Futures is here to stay and we are going to fight for it to the end," Jessica Morffi, University Park Student Government Council president, said.

Although Adrian Carter, Biscayne Bay Student Government Council president, did not give a speech, he did get Florida Lieutenant Governor Frank T. Brogan to leave his office and address the students at the rally.

Carter, along with other student government presidents and members of the Florida Student Association, went to the governor's office to present the 25,000 petitions signed by students from throughout the state university system. Carter asked Brogan to come outside and address the students gathered there. He then escorted the Lt. Governor to the podium on the steps of the Old State Capitol Building.

As the Lt. Governor appeared with Carter and walked through the crowd, the students began shouting "Save Bright Futures!"

Several student government presidents spoke to the crowd before the Brogan came out.

"As of 2002 more than 98,000 students in the state have gotten an education because of Bright Futures," Morffi said in her speech. "This program not only provides scholarships, but it provides them for the best and the brightest in the state of Florida, helping to ensure the future of this great state."

Pablo Paez, Florida Atlantic University student body president and FSA Chairman, took the podium as the crowd chanted, "FAU! FAU! FAU!"

He promised them that their voices would be heard, because a "sleeping giant" has been awakened. He assured the students that FSA was not going to allow elected officials to "balance the budget on the backs of Florida students."

Paez said the students should listen to how many times elected officials say they will not raise taxes.

"Let's call a tax a tax. Tuition increases, fee increases and diminishing scholarships are tax increases on Florida students," Paez said.

But the Lt. Governor's speech was the one that drew the loudest reaction from the crowd.

"We need to start from one basic premise, Bright Futures is good, but everything changes, nothing stays the same and neither does Bright Futures," Brogan said.  "[Any changes to the program] need to be prospective." The rules can't be changed for students "in the middle of the game."

Brogan said "most reasonable students" recognize that if Florida is going to compete in the 21st century, tuition will have to go up. "Now that's a fact," he said.

He said what most "reasonable students" want is not be "priced out of the market" as the cost of higher education continues to increase.

Brogan said that when he was the commissioner of education in 1994, the lottery money was only "going into education not enhancing it." That is the reason, he said, that the Bright Futures program was created. "Now we know it is enhancing it," he said.

Brogan said Bright Futures is a great way to say to students "work hard, study hard and play by the rules and the state will reward you by investing in you." 

"Someone has to guarantee us at the end of the day that as we raise the tuition, as we raise the cost of a post secondary education that we are never pricing students out of the market of that post secondary education," Brogan said.

"You need to stay engaged in what we are doing," he said. Sending e-mails, and visiting local representatives are "very important in maintaining a voice in this discussion," he said.

After speaking for 10 minutes, the Lt. Governor walked back to his office as the students continued to shout, "Keep our futures bright!"

Sheaon Reid, FIU Student Government housing representative and a Bright Futures Scholarship recipient, thought the Lt. Governor's speech was encouraging, but said there are still many questions left unanswered.

"What he said was powerful. He confirmed the benefits of Bright Futures," she said. "He said, 'we need to keep it,' but is it going to be kept?"

Ashley Hicks, a political science freshman, was offended by what Brogan said.

"[He was] making it seem as if we are being unreasonable, by saying, that 'most of the reasonable students understand,'" she said. "I was personally offended."

Alan Bamberg, a communications major had an idea for saving the Bright Futures program.

"They should just raise the price of lottery tickets," he said.

As the bus made its way through the night back to BBC, senior Eyder Peralta was disappointed.

"I thought we were going to change the world today," he said. "I guess I expected too much."

Headline: De turistas en España con los libros a cuestas
Subheadline: Claudia Patricia Davis

&nbsp;

Entre ciudades medievales, arquitectura gótica, acueductos romanos y castillos reales, algunos estudiantes de FIU podrán sumergirse este verano en una experiencia educativa que les abrirá las puertas al fascinante mundo de la cultura española.  

Pasando de turistas a estudiantes, ellos cambiarán su estilo y ritmo de vida, por aproximadamente un mes, para vivir, palpar y absorber todas las facetas que distinguen a uno de los más prolíficos lenguajes en el mundo, el español.  

Encabezado por dos expertos en la materia, el doctor Ricardo Castells y el profesor Aurelio Baldor, el programa de Estudios de Español de Florida International University brinda una oportunidad única a los estudiantes de habla hispana y angloparlantes en Salamanca, España. Los estudiantes que participen no encontrarán la historia de la &#8220;Madre Patria&#8221; sumergida en libros, sino en todos los pasos que siguen mediante un organizado itinerario.

La primera aventura del programa comienza en la cuarta ciudad más grande de España, Sevilla. Allí el grupo estudiantil visitará el palacio Reales Alcázares, conocido por su arte mudéjar, que destaca la influencia musulmana y judía en la España cristiana de la Edad Media y Moderna. Luego, emprenderán una excursión a Córdoba. Esta ciudad, de unos 300,000 habitantes, fue conquistada por los moros en el año 711 y exhibe, como una de sus más importantes estructuras, la Mezquita Mayor. Una vez en Salamanca, se dividirá el tiempo entre la asistencia a clases y otras excursiones.

Sin embargo, según afirman los organizadores del programa, la experiencia no se limitará a visitar sitios de interés turístico o a estudiar el lenguaje, sino también a observar la cultura española desde dentro, desde el núcleo familiar.  Para cada estudiante, se seleccionará una familia que servirá de anfitriona durante la estadía y que, según Castells, se escoge cuidadosamente. Las familias en Salamanca son entrevistadas de antemano por un grupo de personas que colaboran con FIU. El objetivo es asegurar un ambiente cómodo para todos los alumnos, además de disponer de servicios médicos de calidad.

Los cursos que se ofrecen son, en su mayoría, para estudiantes de nivel subgraduado, aunque cabe la posibilidad de incluir algún curso de maestría. Los profesores de FIU y de la Universidad de Salamanca enseñan las clases que incorporan gramática, español conversacional y cultura.   

Para participar en el programa no se requiere una concentración en español, sin embargo, sí es necesario tener un promedio académico de por lo menos 3.25.  El costo es de aproximadamente $3,825.00 y la ayuda financiera, al igual que los préstamos estudiantiles pueden ser solicitados en FIU.  

El costo incluye: tarifa del programa, matrícula para dos clases (seis créditos a nivel de subgrado), tarifa de estudios internacionales, boleto aéreo (ida y vuelta), habitación en los hoteles, guías turísticos, entradas a museos, visitas a Madrid, Cordoba, Segovia y Toledo y cobertura médica limitada. También, se ofrecerá hospedaje, servicios de lavandería y excursiones de fin de semana a Salamanca, en donde las familias anfitrionas suplirán las comidas.

La experiencia educativa y cultural que ofrece este programa es de valor incalculable.  Para participar, se debe llenar una solicitud antes del 31 de marzo. 

Para más información, comuníquese al teléfono (305) 348-3876 ó visite a Castells en DM 499A, University Park campus.

Headline: Primera feria de pasantías en BBC
Subheadline: Carla Valero
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;

Este año, Biscayne Bay Campus (BBC), el recinto del norte de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida, va a sentar un precedente. El próximo 26 de febrero, de las 11 a.m. a las 4 p.m., celebrará su propia feria de pasantías.

La novedad principal que la feria aportará respecto a eventos similares del campus del sur es la comodidad, dice Craig Cunningham, director asociado de Career Services de BBC. 

&#8220;Con esta feria damos la oportunidad a los estudiantes de este campus de que conozcan gente sin necesidad de salir del recinto, y que contacten con empresas en las que puedan empezar a labrarse un futuro profesional&#8221;, afirma Cunningham.

De esta forma, los estudiantes interesados no tendrán que salir a dejar su currículum vitae a las empresas ni viajar hasta el campus del sur. 

&#8220;Las empresas vienen por ellos,&#8221; dice Cunningham.

Unas 26 empresas van a ubicar su stand en el ballroom del Wolfe University Center. Entre éstas, se espera la asistencia de Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Mercy Hospital, WSVN&#8211;Channel 7, Walgreens, Sun-Sentinel, el Departamento de Estado y la Guardia Costera de los Estados Unidos. 

Cunningham dice que se calcula la visita de más de mil estudiantes. A pesar de estar abierta a todos los alumnos de FIU, la feria del BBC está especialmente orientada a los estudiantes de periodismo y comunicación de masas, artes y ciencias, salud y asuntos públicos, criminología, administración de empresas y enfermería. 

Según Cunningham &#8220;las empresas patrocinadoras tendrán la oportunidad de conocer a candidatos muy cualificados, con diversos niveles de formación que están buscando trabajos a tiempo parcial o completo&#8221;.

Claudia Reich, consejera de Career Services, explica que la idea se originó de los propios estudiantes. 

&#8220;Cansados de tener que ir hasta University Park Campus, (los estudiantes) empezaron a demandar una feria propia en el Biscayne Bay. Craig pensó que era injusto que BBC no tuviera su propia feria porque así no se cubrían las necesidades de los estudiantes de aquí. El deseo de los alumnos se ha hecho realidad gracias al Student Government Council, que nos ha dado parte del presupuesto, y al gran esfuerzo realizado por algunos departamentos de la universidad&#8221;, afirma Reich.

A principios de año se contactó a las empresas mediante un formulario en el que se especificaban los requisitos para formar parte de la feria. El departamento tiene una base de datos de todas las empresas que ya han contactado en otras ocasiones. Son empresas nacionales, internacionales, pequeñas, medianas y grandes corporaciones.

Las empresas interesadas pagan una cantidad por tener un stand que las represente. Normalmente, se buscan empresas relacionadas con los cursos que se ofrecen en el campus, que ofrezcan trabajos a tiempo parcial, que acepten a estudiantes con poca experiencia y que sean internacionales o residentes.

A pesar de estos requisitos, hay empresas que son reticentes a contratar estudiantes internacionales. La gran cantidad de estudiantes extranjeros que conviven en BBC y desean enriquecer su formación profesional ha hecho que se piense en ellos y vengan empresas dispuestas a patrocinarlos.

Cunningham conoce bien las quejas de los estudiantes internacionales, los cuales se sienten marginados y muy limitados en el tema laboral o por la oferta de pasantías exclusivas para residentes.

Por ejemplo, Aureli Espana, estudiante internacional de la maestría en Periodismo Investigativo, es una de ellos. 

&#8220;Está claro que me he encontrado con muchas trabas por no ser residente, las empresas no me quieren contratar porque así se ahorran problemas. Yo creo que si una persona es válida, venga de donde venga tiene derecho a ser contratada&#8221;, asegura Espana.

Cunningham, por su parte, opina que el problema de la negativa inicial de las empresas a contratar internacionales se debe al desconocimiento de los procesos de inmigración. 

&#8220;Las empresas no saben qué pueden y qué no pueden hacer con el trabajador internacional y muchas tienen miedo a contratarlo. Es un problema de desinformación, sobre todo después de lo que han cambiado las leyes desde el 11 de septiembre&#8221;, explica.

Uno de los factores más determinantes a la hora de ir a buscar empleo es la indumentaria y el saber estar. La presencia física puede revelar mucho sobre una persona e, incluso, puede dificultar o facilitar su selección por parte de una empresa.

Reich y otros miembros de Career Services ofrecen consejos sobre cómo ir vestido y qué hacer ante un representante de recursos humanos de cualquier empresa.

&#8220;La preparación para una entrevista es fundamental. Los estudiantes deben vestir apropiadamente, ir aseados, tener una buena actitud y, lo más importante, estar informados de todo&#8221;, concluye Reich. 

BBC tendrá su propia feria de las pasantías con cabida para todo tipo de estudiantes. Se espera que sea una buena experiencia y que permita a los asistentes conseguir oportunidades profesionales de interés para su futuro y su formación.

Headline: Don't Tempt Me fails to achieve anything
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
Hollywood has always defended its turf with the kind of ferociousness usually associated with dogs in advanced stages of hydrophobia; apparently, starvation has gotten to the rest of the pack, because more and more foreign films are looking to take a bite out of the profits. 

Witness the current resurgence of Latin and Spanish cinema; it's basically paying homage to everything that's slick and derivative in mainstream American cinema. 

If we find  ourselves watching more foreign movies, it's because those foreign movies are becoming less and less foreign by the week. Case in point, "Don't Tempt Me," Agustin Diaz Yanez' black comedy, starring Penelope Cruz and Victoria Abril. It is ostensibly a Spanish film, but one would be hard pressed to think of a movie that owes a bigger debt to American movie-making. All the plot elements are borrowed from the Hollywood canon, and the movie plays like a well-oiled remix of "It's a Wonderful Life," "Pulp Fiction" and "Thelma and Louise."

The original Spanish title was "Sin Noticias de Dios," ("No News from God"), but apparently someone along the line found that either too blasphemous or too depressing, and we're stuck with "Don't Tempt Me." The battle between Heaven and Hell is raging, and God is nowhere to be seen. 

When the managerial forces on both sides realize that the outcome of the eternal struggle can be resolved by the soul of a boxer, (a situation which is only nebulously explained), angel Lola (Victoria Abril) and fallen angel Carmen (Penelope Cruz) race to seduce the boxer into their respective sides.

 This sounds like a great set-up for a high concept skin flick, but there's not a bit of welcome sexiness in "Don't Tempt Me;" as a matter of fact, the angels don't really do much of anything expect eagerly watch as the whole situation is decided by outside forces, at least until the very end. 

Until then, the movie relies too much on its conceit of presenting Heaven and Hell as highly bureaucratic set-ups, where the salvation of souls is relegated to the "Mergers and Acquisitions" departments.

As for Penelope Cruz, you'll never get a better chance to understand everything that's right (and wrong) with her. "Don't Tempt Me" forces her to deliver lines in both English and Spanish, and the contrast is frightful. In Spanish, she's self-assured, vibrant, soulful, you name it. But the moment she switches to English she's self-conscious and charmless, 

The language situation is one of the most obvious difficulties in "Don't Tempt Me;" part of the concept implies that, roughly, people speak English in Hell, Spanish on Earth and French in Heaven, roughly. 

It sounds cutesy on paper, but when one has to deal with those awful unreadable white subtitles "Goldmember" so hilariously mocked, trouble arises. Luckily I could follow all three languages, but if you can only speak English or Spanish or French, two thirds of the movie will be a complete mystery to you. 

There's nothing really wrong with "Don't Tempt Me," except that it faithfully follows along the tracks of countless American movie schemes. 

By the end of the day, Lola and Carmen will have bonded, learned a little from each other and proved that Cruz may be getting no news from God, but at least her agent will keep in touch.

Headline: FIU students have short films selected for festival screening
Author: Lisa Galvez
&nbsp;
Passion. One word to describe the enthusiastic flow of words coming out of Sai Jerrybandan's voice over the phone. "A director has to have creativity; artistic sense is very important. You have to know about everything; about production, camera, lights, acting, love, hate, etc.. It's the most difficult job because you have to manage everyone and everything."  

"I get withdrawal symptoms when I don't go to the movies. I'm always at the movies, at least three times a week," laughs Gwen Gonzalez innocently.   

Both are TV production majors, each in her senior year, and each completed their first film last semester. These two FIU students share a love of film and artistic creativity.

Gonalez's directorial debut, "El Crimen Perfecto" (The Perfect Crime), and Jerrybandan's directorial debut, "Guru: The Guiding Light," will both appear at the Miami International Film Festival, presented by FIU, which takes place from Feb. 21 - Mar. 2.  

For Jerrybandan "the theme, the content is the most important part of a film." Her film is a short documentary on her father, a teacher of yoga, and 11 of his disciples, who include Americans, Hispanics and Trinidadians. His message is one of spiritual guidance.

Her exposure to different cultures and the arts lend to the creative energy waiting to burst out of her. Jerrybandan was born in Trinidad and at age one she left for Venezuela. Fluent in English and Spanish, Jerrybandan can also sing and pray in Hindu. 

She studied theatre and acting in Venezuela, Orlando and Miami. It was against this backdrop that her directing career began. "From the moment I was born, I wanted to be an actress.  And when I began acting, I realized that I wanted to learn about directing. I like to make the scenes. I love the arts. All of them. I believe it's possible to simultaneously do things well that you love. I'm a very optimistic person; very passionate."  

"I'm excited to have completed my first film. Happy that it will show in the festival."  She adds, "I want to be a director of cinema one day. But for now I want to keep learning, keep working; maybe work on a film. I want to test the waters." Jerrybandan is currently an intern at the Miami International Film Festival office in the FIU South Campus.

Born in Caracas, Venezuela, Gonzlez came with her family, originally from Cuba, to Miami at the age of nine. Her love for film stems from the early age of 11 when she would help her father, an actor and writer in the Spanish market, with the audio and lights for his plays at the Teatro de Bellas Artes on Calle Ocho.  "Ever since I was little I was exposed to theatre. And when I got older I decided I wanted to do film."

Gonzalez's short film is about a famous Miami architect, played by her father, who is slowly dying in a mental asylum.  His best friend comes to visit and reveals who trapped him in the asylum. The architect realizes he is not sick and with his best friend they plan the perfect murder to take vengeance on the person that put the architect there.

Gonzalez's dream, like Jerrybandan's, would be to work with the cinema. "Film is the hardest aspect of this business because there are many TV stations and programs in every state, every city, but there is only one Hollywood. Hopefully it does happen for me and you'll see my name up next to Steven Spielberg." For now Gonzalez works as an assistant producer for the show "American Soccer" on Gol TV, a bilingual channel that comes out on satellite dish.  

The most challenging part about directing a film, says Gonzalez, is having people easy to work with. "But I was lucky last semester, my team was great." Now, the most challenging part for her will come after she graduates. "The hard part will be getting the money for equipment. Being a student, we are allowed to borrow the school's equipment." 

"Also, I don't know where I'll be next. One day I'll be in one place and one day in another. There's nothing steady in this business."

Her advice for aspiring TV students is to "be creative, don't be afraid to do something new."

The chance given to these students to explore their creativity and make these films is a result of the new class implemented for the first time last semester, Advanced Videography, taught by assoiate professor Bert Delgado, M.A. Professor Delgado, who has his own production company called Del Mar Production Inc. in Pembroke Pines, is delighted with his students' works. "I'm lucky to have them." 

He says, before this class, students were limited to doing work only in the SJMC TV Studio. "With this class, I'm letting them be creative and have the opportunity to use equipment freely, off campus."  

Gonzalez says "it's the best class in my opinion."  "We put into practice what we have learned all year. We are completely on our own on how we do the project; the only requirement is to produce a great one.  We can choose to do either documentaries, music videos, talk shows, or short films.  There are no boundaries."

Professor Delgado hopes to get session projectors into the TV Studio, to share with others his students' works. "Even better would be to eventually get e-cinema, electronic cinema. Now that would put us on the map."

These girls' short films will each be paired with one of the feature films from the program, which will appear at the Regal South Beach Cinema on Lincoln Road.  They will precede the feature.  

Jerrybandan's documentary will precede "The Education of Gore Vidal" on Thursday, Feb. 27, 7:00 p.m., and "The Nazi Officer's Wife" on Friday, Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m.

Headline: Agronomist documents revolutionary hero
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
The vivid struggle of a nation stained by the loss of innocent blood and the courage of one man who always remained loyal to his ideals come together in "The Agronomist." This interesting documentary, a work-in-progress directed by Jonathan Demme, follows the lives of Jean Dominique, an agronomist turned journalist, and his wife Michelle Montas, who led the efforts for freedom of the press under several oppressive regimes in Haiti. Efforts that lasted for forty years.

The beauty of this documentary lies in the fact that the central issue is not based on politics, although Dominique was heavily involved in this field, but that it shows the persevering spirit of "the agronomist with no land." One does not need to be a foreign affairs expert or a political science major in order to relate to the protagonist and the motives for his actions.

The story begins with Dominique's childhood and later moves on to describe his initial efforts to establish informative radio broadcasting under Francois Duvalier's regime. Radio, which up until that time was allowed for pure entertainment in Haiti, was revolutionized by the new idea of disseminating information to the public. 

Radio Haiti Inter, which Dominique owned, not only introduced the idea of broadcasting in the Creole dialect, but also denounced the violent abuses of the Macoute, Duvalier's personal militia.  

The documentary wonderfully captures the essence of the Haitian people, from the spiritual rituals in Haiti's countryside, to the misery, pain and hopelessness felt by all those who fell victim to the denigrating actions of the dictatorships. 

Actions that also threatened Dominique's life in many ways since he was arrested, beaten, sent into exile twice and eventually, murdered.

Although the documentary does not feature fancy scenes or special effects, its simple format contributes to the realism of the scenes, which undoubtedly stirs a wide variety of the viewer's emotions.

Tears flooded my eyes as I watched the scene where a half-smiling, half-crying Dominique returns to a free Haiti, after six years in exile, to be greeted by a crowd of 60,000 people. Anger kicked in as I watched Dominique's body being retrieved from the radio station.

The story challenges the viewer's ideals and principles, and I walked away appreciating all of the privileges of freedom of speech.  

By the end, one can only admire Dominique's persistence and share his devotion towards freedom for the people who so valiantly pursue it, and who truly deserve it.

Headline: "Old School" stars share thoughts on comedy
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell may not be the Three Stooges, but you wouldn't know, judging by  the friendly, mock-hostile banter that accents the easy ties formed between the three actors during the making of the upcoming comedy "Old School." Luckily, they stop short of poking each other's eyes out while being interviewed.

They're certainly an unlikely trio. Wilson is quiet, almost shy, with some of the sadness of his "Royal Tanenbaums" character still floating around. Vaughn is cool, self-possessed, the indie star who knows he's an indie star, and has the chain-smoking habit to prove it. Ferrell is exactly what one would expect from his many "Saturday Night Live" personas: irritatingly funny.

The film tells the story of three middle aged buddies who decide to belatedly recreate a college experience by founding an off-campus fraternity. Directed by Todd Phillips, who last helmed "Road Trip," the movie toes the line between sophomoric humor and subtler stuff.

But it is foremost a comedy, as Luke Wilson makes clear:  "You end up improvising, trying to draw the funnier aspects out of every scene. Still, whatever kind of movie it is, you'll get more out of it if you feel connected to the characters." Wilson has a history of toeing the line between comedy and sincere emotion with well-chosen, albeit relatively minor roles. Of course, no one's perfect, as Wilson himself points out: "Vince referred to a certain film I made as 'Legally Bland.'"

Vince Vaughn, of course, has a famously caustic sense of humor, and it reflects on his character.  "I find 'improvisationals' funny. My background is improv. After "Swingers" I was offered a lot of comedy roles I didn't want to take, because what I find funny is over-commitment to reality, and this movie is based on reality, there's some emotional truth in it." 

He adds: "I always laugh at stuff I see in day to day life. To see some odd human interaction, that's humor."

Will Ferrell has a more broad idea of what's funny, but he mostly values fearlessness in the telling of a joke. 

When questioned about the scene in "Old School" in which he streaks down the street, a scene in which rap star Snoop Dogg has a cameo, he chuckles:  "Good, good times, but I guess I'll only do it if it serves the story" 

"As for me, there isn't enough booze in this hotel," says Vaughn.

But Ferrell is more concerned with a certain rapper's guest appearance: "The worst thing about it was being naked in front of Snoop Dogg, or Snoopy as I like to call him." As a matter of fact,  the presence of the notorious musician extended its influence to the rest of the cast, and Wilson recalls Vince Vaughn's visit to the rapper's trailer as the filming wound down: "This was before Snoop 'quit,' so after a few minutes in Snoop's trailer, Vince was talking in tongues." 

The continuous pranks and shenanigans during the making of "Old School" lead Will Ferrell to reminisce about his crazy college antics:

 "I had a work study job in the audiovisual department, so I would leave my job, dress up as a janitor and show up in the middle of random classes, or I would stand outside the room with a power drill." He stops for a moment: "And I killed a guy."

 Maybe, maybe not. In any case, that's the kind of slapstick even a Stooge should think twice about.

Headline: Exies walk safe path
Author: Saudy Pena
&nbsp;
Don't look to The Exies to push rock music into the realm of the unique or halfway exciting. In their second album, Inertia, the Southern California quartet are quite comfortable churning out tunes that remain faithful to the ugly monster of imitation. You know, the one that dwells in the evil forest of corporate rock. 

With Inertia, you can't help but feel you're being hauled through a cheap, $5 tour of rock music from the '80s through the present day. And the tour guide is a bad cover band.  It's not that The Exies are bad because they lack musical skill. On the contrary, they've pretty much mastered guitar-driven explosion and arena-rock vibes. The problem is they fail to put their authentic imprint on Inertia. And what you end up getting is a band who hasn't broken free of all their influences. 

The first track, "Goddess," kicks you in the stomach with its blasting guitar and thunderous drums. According to drummer Dennis Wolfe, the song is about "overcoming the things you're spoon-fed as you're growing up." It's a blaring tune that's too formulaic for its own good. The mixed influence of Stone Temple Pilots and Foo Fighters can be heard as singer Scott Stevens flexes his bland lyrical muscle: "I was knee deep in a sick love/ I was cross-eyed under your drug." 

"Can't Relate," resounds with an '80s up-tempo style, complete with amazing Don Henley-like vocals by Stevens. Again, the glossy guitar provides the angst-ridden song with its thickness as a simple drum rhythm makes you jump around in a mindless spasm - not because it's good, but because you hope that will make the song end sooner. The lyrics don't help either: "Take it easy/Take it easy/Wasting all my time/Wasting all my time/Cuz I am so lazy after all this time." After the track is over you're the one that can't relate to The Exies.

"Without" speeds us forward in time to contemporary rock sounds. More driving guitars (what a shocker) coupled with the heaviness of bands like Limp Bizkit and Godsmack deliver a pounding tune full of pain and anger. Freddy Herrera adds a gurgling bass line that really rocks. Up until Stevens belts the chorus, that is. Then you realize he's the vocal clone of Linkin Park's Chester Bennington.  

Fortunately, one of the better songs is "Inertia." Even though it continues the generic predictability of the rest of the album, Stevens pulls off decent lyrics that tug at your heartstrings: "Got a head full of one-way rides that you wouldn't believe/A giant leap from your heart to my arms before it's time to leave."

It's a charming tune about inner transformations and letting go. Somewhat cheesy, but it works well when compared to the rest of the songs. The chorus offers a hopeful message that makes you want to give The Exies a pat on the back for a good effort: "This is the time when all things old will pass/New things will be found," cries Stevens. 

It seems strange that a band named after the existentialist movement of the 1960s wouldn't offer much depth or creativity into their music. After you listen to the whole album (if you can), it really feels like you've just listened to someone's mix CD, full of very bland, un-original songs. From one song to the next, you never quite hear the band's "voice." It's as if they are just interpreting the last several years of rock. I guess The Exies haven't learned the most important lesson of  Rock Music 101: Put yourself in the music.

Headline: "Shanghai Knights" packs punch
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
I am what I call an Act-Chan fan. That means I am a fan of action movies starring Jackie Chan and "Shanghai Knights" is no exception. Basically, it's the same story as both "Rush Hour" and "Rush Hour 2," but over a century ago. Fast hands meet big mouth; Chan kicks ass, other guy talks too much; good guys fight bad guys and someone gets the girl. 

It's even better than the first one. I never thought anyone would do a sequel to "Shanghai Noon." Apparently, director David Dobkin ("Clay Pigeons") thought it was worth a shot to pick up where director Tom Dey left off.

The story takes place back in 1887, six years after "Shanghai Noon." Chon Wang (Jackie Chan), now sheriff of Carson City, Nevada, has just received word that his father (Kim Chan - no relation...I think) has been murdered and the Imperial Seal (not the animal), which his family has been guarding for generations, has been stolen. 

His sister, Chon Lin (Fann Wong), has tracked down the killer to London, England and now he must find her, avenge their father's murder and bring the seal back to China. 

He goes to New York City to hit his old cowboy buddy, Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), up for a cash loan, only to find that he blew all of their money and now splits his work time between waiter and male gigolo. This leads to a few jokes and the movie's first fight scene. 

Our hero's take what very little they have, thanks to old reliable Roy, and head for the jolly old shores of England. 

No sooner do they take five steps off the dock does Roy start insulting the British (he just loves to rub it in about them losing the Revolutionary War), and doesn't seem capable of stopping. So it's more than likely the result of bad karma that his pocket-watch was pick-pocketed by a dirty little rapscallion of a boy. 

They chase him down a bad street where they meet even worse people, with whom they get into a large scuffle: buckets flying, fruit stands knocked over, people climbing onto and getting tossed off of rooftops, and Wang using an umbrella in a fight that strangely resembles a famous Gene Kelly dance. 

This results not only in a chance meeting with a peculiar Scotland Yard inspector who becomes their new ally, but they also find Lin, who got arrested. 

As it turns out, she found her father's killer and tried to do him in, but he happens to be Lord Rathbone (Aidan Gillen), British ambassador to China and tenth in line to the throne. So not only was she arrested, but the newspapers are referring to her as "Loony Lin."

On the whole, I found "Shanghai Knights" to be very entertaining. However, some of it I do have a problem with, particularly with its historical accuracy, or, in this case, the lack there of. Although their encounters with both Queen Victoria and Jack the Ripper would seem plausible, their encounters with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Charlie Chaplin are very inaccurate. In 1887, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was twenty-eight, but the actor that portrayed him looked several years older than that. 

An even bigger mistake was adding the character of little Charlie Chaplin. That itself was something of an enigma considering that Chaplin wasn't even born until 1889. It might have worked had history been off by at least ten years, but I don't think Hollywood could get the proper permits to mess with the space-time continuum. Still, having the characters encounter famous historical figures was a good idea. It is very similar to "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles." 

I also thought the love interest between Lin and Roy was a good touch. On one hand, they seem like the odd couple, and on the other, they're just perfect. On the whole, "Knights" is more than enjoyable.

Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
Q: You have been nominated for the Best Male Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Album Grammys.  What are your expectations?
A:  Im just happy to be nominated. I haven't won any awards yet so my expectations are not damn great. As an artist, all I can do is hope for the best.
Q: Lil' Pimp, the hip-hop cartoon collaboration you did with Lil' Kim is coming out next October. How was this experience?
A: That was an easy check because all I had to do was go over there and do the voice. That was an easy check for sure.
Q: You also had appearances in the movie "Fast and the Furious 2." Is acting something that you want to pursue in the future?
A:   Definitely.  I feel like I want to be challenged. I want to get in some sex scenes too.
Q: Your next album, Chicken and Beer, is due out this summer.  Are we going to see a new side of Ludacris?
A:  Oh! Expect the unexpected.  It's going to be half old stuff and half new stuff.
Q: About Pepsi....
A:  F*** them.
Q: Pepsi removed you from their campaign because of apparent complaints about your use of foul language and obscenity, and hired Ozzy Osbourne instead. Russell Simmons is now directing the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network in the boycott against Pepsi. How is this progressing?
A: I really can't talk about because these are legal matters that are going on right now, but we are demanding respect. That's what this is about. I feel like I have been disrespected.
Q: What is the biggest thing you have learned from your experience in this business?
A: How fake people in the music industry are. People do things just to keep their jobs or their relations.
Q: What is next for Ludacris?
A:   I will be working with the members of Disturbing Tha Peace on their upcoming albums.

Headline: Ensemble preserves Duncan spirit
Author: Jennifer Sitig
&nbsp;
The Isadora Duncan Dance Ensemble performed at FIU on Sat. 15. The ensemble was established in Miami in 1992, but the Duncan roots go back to the early 1920's.  

Dr. Andrea Mantell-Seidel, artistic director and dancer in the ensemble, utilizes the Duncan technique today.  Isadora Duncan was a dancer known for her movement and technique that liberated the body, mind and soul. She danced with her feet, arms, and legs bare; free from restraints with sheer silk tunics styled after the ancient Greeks. 

Mantell-Seidel said Duncan is an "important figure in modern dance and modern art" and believes the performance will be beneficial to students and the public.  

The Isadora Duncan Dance Ensemble is the fifth generation to carry on Isadora Duncan's technique.  Today, the company members consist of Michelle Kickasola, Stephanie Bastos, Heather Maloney, Maria Risolia, Ivette Sotomayor, and Maribel Gonzalez.  

The Ensemble first started with a solo artist Andrea Mantell-Seidel, a guest artist Lori Belilove and many present members who were then thirteen and fourteen years old.  The thirteen and fourteen year olds were the same age as Isadora's young company members also known as the "the Isadorables."  The Ensemble developed a repertory over time and has been invited and performed in dance festivals in Canada, Florida, Germany, Guatemala, New York City, and Washington D.C., to name a few. The Ensemble's culturally diverse composition reflects its South Florida home, the humanity principles Isadora Duncan held and a commitment to dance arts.  

Seidel, also an associate professor in the dance department at FIU and director of the Intercultural Dance and Music Institute, is bringing her "Miami Isadorables" to perform at FIU for the reason that "we want to support FIU's VH 100 series."  Their hope when performing at FIU and other venues is to "outreach to West Dade and educate dance majors and audiences", said Seidel. 

Julie Levien, and third generation Duncan dancer, was in the original companies of two of the adopted Duncan daughters, Anna and Irma Duncan.  Levien, artistic advisor of the ensemble, travels to Miami in the winter months to help the Ensemble develop the Duncan technique and give an opening lecture and narration for the Ensemble's performances.

Nikka Scott, an Advertising Major, said, "Not too many people understand dance as an art form, and many take it for granted. Some people may understand that dance isn't just a hobby; it's a skill, and for many people a career. I believe exposing students to various art forms will help them to become well rounded."

Headline: Graduate creates "Mosshead"
Author: Mary Jo Morrell
&nbsp;
Want to hear some original music performed live on stage? No, I'm not talking about Ja Rule or the Battle of the Bands. What I am talking about is "Mosshead," the first play performed at FIU that was actually written by a student playwright. 

"Mosshead" is about David Wyatt, a young musician who has just been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 

The disease, which is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, is characterized by extreme mood swings. 

David suffered through the cycles - euphoric highs followed by abysmal lows - for years before doctors gave it a name, and now he's determined to not let the label become a limit. He's got everything going for him - the support of his girlfriend, Darlene, and what looks like a promising future in music. 

Deep inside, he feels he's a person, not just a disease. Becky, David's mom, isn't so confident though. She's been through all the research; she's read the studies. Her son's condition is not just going to go away. 

The story revolves around the question of what truly defines madness, and the conflicts that definition brings about the relationship between parents and the children they so often destroy with their well-intentioned efforts.

William Whitehurst, who wrote "Mosshead," is a graduate student in the master of fine arts creative writing program at the Biscayne Bay Campus. He says the play, which he's been writing for almost a year now, focuses on issues faced by everyone, particularly twenty-somethings: tensions with parents, building intimate relationships with members of the opposite sex and finding one's own identity, to name a few. 

The characters' dialogue, which is rife with profanity, led to its self-imposed NC-17 rating. "It's not meant to offend anyone," Whitehearst explained. "I just wanted to capture the way most kids at this age really talk."

Whitehurst, who has written other plays, including "Flyin' Ryan" and "American Dreams," says he feels no added pressure because of the fact that this is the first FIU production by a student playwright. "The pressure is on the actors; I can just hide backstage," he chuckles. 

Christina Perdomo, who plays Darlene, says about working with Whitehurst, "It's a good opportunity to work with the playwright right here at rehearsals and to see what his intentions really are, to ask questions, and to present ideas. It's a great experience."

It can be a great experience for anyone who takes the time and invests the five dollars to attend, according to Whitehurst. He feels that not only students, but also the community in general, usually don't realize the unique place that theater holds among art forms. 

"A book is written. A film is made. But in a play, the audience is always the final collaborator," Whitehurst says.

Headline: Variety of styles marks Art exhibition
Author: Isis Iglesias
&nbsp;
There is much visual and artistic diversity in the latest exhibit at The Art Museum at FIU.  "Faces & Figures" is the current offering in its long running series, American Art Today.  

The artwork is as varied as the artists. There are 34 artists in all, of whom many have already established art showcases in some of the world's greatest museums. With the rest being some of the best emerging artists in our own city.

The show is an interesting collection of work because of its subject matter: the human face and figure.  

It is not a theme that has been very popular in contemporary art recently, but that may be changing. Art novices and traditionalists alike will feel welcomed by the offering of the exhibit. 

The work is not only a pleasure to behold, it's also readily accessible to interpretation since it is a subject that is familiar to us all: ourselves.  

According to curator Roni Feinstein, the idea for the theme was presented to her by Dahlia Morgan, FIU's Art Museum director.  

Morgan approached her with the concept and asked if she would help to organize the exhibit since she was busy with preparation for the new Art Museum building.  

 Feinstein explains, "Her idea was that the exhibition include no photography, or video; that it be traditional media: painting, sculpture, drawing." Feinstein ran with it and gathered an extensive collection of art, all of it focusing on the representation of the human form.  

As traditional as the chosen media may be, it still provides a challenging look at modern art.  

Much of the work explores not only the physical aspects of human figure, but many deeper psychological and social issues as well.  

The subject of artist Kerry James Marshall's work is often the African-American experience; in his painting, "Scout (Master)," Marshall paints the skin of the young man in a tone of black so dark that the features of his face are invisible.  

He often paints figures in this vague way and is interested in the history and plight of blacks in the United States.  

 The feel of the works presented is highly eclectic, yet tied together by the one commonality, the human figures.

 The exhibit includes well known artists such as Alex Katz, Alice Neel, Carroll Dunham, Chuck Close, Kenny Scharf, Kiki Smith and many others.  

Their works are all exquisitely made, from the gorgeous watercolor depictions of the body in dance by David Remfry, to the hauntingly beautiful sculpture by Kiki Smith depicting the kneeling body of a young girl in front of a white wall full of gold stars. 

Of the Miami Artistry shown, "The Harvester" by Maria Brito displays highly developed craftsmanship. 

It is a sculpted wooden surface carved into branches with the figure of a woman holding a cloth as a pair of disjointed hands cuts her hair with a pair of scissors. The shaped wood gives the piece a sense of three-dimensionality while the paint applied to the smooth surface adds to its sense of almost photographic reality. 

Brito is an FIU Alumnus who later gained her master of fine arts from the University of Miami. She credits the advancement of her career to FIU professor Bill Burke, who really encouraged her work.  

She is currently an adjunct professor at Barry University where she teaches twice a week. She was very excited to be part of an exhibit with such distinguished artists.

 "I feel humbled, I feel just privileged to be in this show," imparts Brito.

In other works there is an exploration of childhood, such as in the painting "Arrangement" by Amy Cutler, a tension filled piece reminiscent of a fairy tale illustration.  

This issue is also depicted, albeit subtlety, in the ceramic sculpture by Viola Frey of a towering blue suited man, meant to be representative of a child's view of adults. 

In the ghost-like pieces by Hernan Bas, there are pervasive references to the inner and outer worlds of young men. 

The comedic highlight of the show lies in Jim Torok's pieces, "Life of the Artist (Good) and (Bad)," in one he shows the advantages of an artistic career, in the other the disadvantages.  

Incorporating text and comic strip-style drawings, his take on the art world is hilarious. 

The exhibit runs through March. Visit the museum's web site or call 305 348-2890 for information on hours and upcoming events.

&nbsp;
After eight losses, FIU turned around and defeated South Alabama by 10 points on Thursday night, 56-46. 

However, just two days later the team dropped to New Orleans, where it lost 49-48. The Golden Panthers now stand at 7-16, 1-9 Sun Belt Conference.

FIU 56, USA 46

FIU closed its eight-game losing streak on Thursday as it cruised past South Alabama, 56-46, in Mobile, AL. 

FIU started slow but quickly caught on, as the first half experienced nine lead changes and six ties. 

In the first half, Golden Panther Matias contributed eight points and Novakovic seven.

With a running lay-up, Baez increased FIU's chances to win by ending the period with a single-point lead at 23-22. 

At the beginning of the second half, USA tried to change the pace of the game by establishing a 5-0 run. 

The Golden Panthers reacted and advanced on two three-pointers by Matias and Fernandez, who raised the score to 38-33.

FIU extended their five-point lead to nine, thanks to Novakovic and successive steals by Carlos Morban. Morban made four steals that night, and the 144th of his career. 

With less than three minutes remaining, Jaguar Chris Young closed their losing gap to 45-40.

FIU accomplished its victory on nine free throws and one field goal, while allowing their opponents to make only two points. 

"I am extremely happy for the kids. We knew coming in we had to control the tempo of the game and that's exactly what happened. We defended with a lot of energy, dominated the glass and limited our turnovers," stated Head Coach Donnie Marsh. 

The Golden Panthers shot 44-percent from the floor.

Young led USA with a game-high 14 points. 

For the Golden Panthers, Nikola Novakovic was the leading-scorer, as he grabbed 13 points. Together, Matias and Baez tallied a total of 22 points for FIU.

UNO 49, FIU 48

FIU fell to New Orleans by a single point, 49-48, on Saturday. In the first half, the Privateers extended their early five-point lead to 13-5, until the Golden Panthers responded with a 5-0 run of their own. 

Carlos Fernandez's three-point basket narrowed this deficit for the team.
New Orleans then achieved a seven-point advantage. As a result, FIU pulled a 9-3 run and succeeded in closing the half just one point down, 23-22.

The Golden Panthers added seven points to their name at the start of the second half. 

The Privateers shot back with four points and tied the score at 29.

Thirty minutes into the contest, Eulis Baez's four points and Carlos Morban's three-pointer gave FIU a 36-35 lead. New Orleans rose and took a 49-48 advantage, before Privateer forward Victor Brown fouled out. 

While FIU had possession of the ball, Nikola Novakovic was penalized for traveling. Still, Morban succeeded in stealing the inbound with a timeout called and 19 seconds left.  

FIU then inbounded the ball to Baez. 

Baez later rebounded a missed shot and passed to Fab Fisher, but time ran out before Fisher could make a successful attempt on the basket.  
The Golden Panthers out-shot the Privateers, 42-percent versus 37-percent.

Fisher scored the most for FIU with 11 points, while UNO's Hector Romero made 18.

Headline: Dim future for Bright Futures?
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Last Thursday, I went to Tallahassee along with more than 100 other FIU students, who were there to rally against the possible elimination of the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program. 

Despite the excruciatingly long bus ride and the mind-numbing scenery along the expressway, the experience was eye-opening.

I was able to witness firsthand the political garbage Florida Lt. Governor Frank Brogan offered students in his speech.

At the capitol, we gathered with students from other state universities and listened to speeches by our respective student government presidents.  They urged us to unite in the fight to save the Bright Futures Program and make our voices heard.  

As the speeches came to a close, the approximately 600 students chanted "Keep Bright Futures bright," waving neon signs in protest of the possible elimination of the program.

But as I looked around, I noticed a few things that made me question the knowledge and motivation of the students participating in the rally.  

Some students misspelled the name of the program on their signs.  

They referred to the program as "Bright Future" instead of Bright Futures. 

 It seems to me that if you are going to go on a nine-hour trip to protest to legislators against the elimination of a program, you should at least know the name of the program.  

I wonder if these students even knew what the program was or if they were just there to cash in on the Student Government Association's offer of free transportation and free food for rally participants.

Moreover, some of the students seemed naïve. When Brogan fed them candy-coated crap in his speech, saying that the Bright Futures program has to go through changes because everything "goes through changes," they swallowed it whole.  

The few boos in the crowd were drowned out by applause.  

Brogan was condescending and said "most reasonable students" understand that tuition must increase in order for this state to compete in the 21st century.  

He treated students as if they were utterly clueless.  The sad part is, some of them seemed not to notice or care. 

After listening to his speech, I am glad that he is going to be the next president of Florida Atlantic University and not FIU. 

As former commissioner of education and future FAU president, Brogan should be more attentive to students' concerns.  

The reality is that higher education often gets shifted to the back burner in funding considerations for education. 

The government tends to pay more attention to K-12, although college students are the ones who will have the most immediate effect on the economy.

College students need to get more involved in the electoral process and make sure that their voices are heard.

It was great seeing students rallying together, trying to make a difference, but it would have been better if they were more educated about the cause at hand.  

Some of them seemed to be there because they had no cause, and desperately wanted something to protest about, something to feel passion for.  

But despite their reasons for participating, at least they made the decision to be proactive and get involved.

If nothing else, this rally showed legislators that students care about what goes on in Congress, especially when it has the potential of negatively affecting their futures.

Headline: Letters to the Editor: Germany, France have questionable motives
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor: 

I would like to start by thanking President George Walker Bush for looking out for our future and the future of generations to follow with his bravery and leadership in the war on terrorism. 

It is this very reason that there is opposition to this ensuing war on Iraq. 

The opposition against the war on Iraq is purely for political reasons. 

I will outline some key highlights. 

First of all, the protest rally that was put on by ANSWR and the Nazi/Worker's World party illustrated all of the racism and bigotry of the remaining liberals and the liberals-in-hiding of the Democratic party. 

The protest rally had Democratic presidential candidates like Revered Al "the bigot" Sharpton. 

I was watching to see if they would present any rational argument against this war, but as usual it was all emotion and an all-out attack. 

It was an attack on Bush and the Bush family - claiming oil interests.

The political/liberal argument is represented in other ways - and represented by nations with short-term memories. Lets look at two nations: Germany and France. 

The French are a bunch of weasles and pansies. That will never change. 

They have an anti-American agenda. They hate America and everything it stands for anyway. 

Both Germany and France obviously did not learn the lesson that Adolf Hitler - another cruel dictator - taught them. 

It was America who liberated them through a regime change, and it was America who helped nation build these countries. 

And how do they repay us? By rewarding Saddam Hussein. 

First of all, France's reservation is for obvious reasons. 

They have an oil agreement with "Adolf Hussein," which, by the way, undermined sanctions. 

We won't forget this when we go into Iraq next week or the following week and liberate this nation the same way we liberated France and Germany.  

But what must be explored is the intent here. 

Do Germany and France make a good case? 

They claim that war is not an option. But did they forget how nazism was destroyed? 

Historically, freedom was not obtained without spillage of blood. It is called peace through strength. 

America liberated itself from being a colony of the British and started a democracy - by defeating the British. 

We did not simply say "Stop it or else we will write 12 declarations." 

The same people who oppose this war would have opposed war against the British. 

Why? 

They are weasles and pansies. They are not brave at all. 

But you can be certain that these liberal weasles are loving every minute of the freedoms they have today.   

This brings us to a final important point. 

The war on terrorism will be won by conservatism and not liberalism and socialism. 

By fighting for our freedom instead of talking about freedom through resolutions we will win this war. 

If we adopt France's and Germany's amnesia democracy itself - what America has fought for - will be dead forever.

WINNER
FIU student body:  Traveling 520 miles on a bus to go to a protest isn't the typical definition of a college road trip. Your participation in the Tallahassee Bright Futures rally  is commendable. It may not save the program as we know it, but you gave it your best shot.


LOSER
Lt. Gov. Brogan: There's no doubt the class size amendment put you in a tough  situation, but to hurt Bright Futures is just wrong.  "Nothing stays the same and neither does Brigh Futures"? We know what that means, and it's a disservice to students.

Headline: Jail trip changes perceptions of prison
Author: Maria Herrera / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
When I got out of jail last Thursday, I began re-examining all of my pre-conceived ideas about crime and punishment. 

My principles became blurry, my opinions on the subject disappeared, and I was forced somehow to construct my own idea of what it is to not be free. 

I had never been in jail before my college class took a tour through a Broward County jail. 

Prior to arriving, I had a mental picture of the facility based on what I had seen in shows like "Oz" or "Cops." 

Did I expect to see a Floridian Alcatraz or the San Quentin of the sunshine state? 

I know I expected to see dangerous individuals, repulsive beings that somehow deserved to be there. Tattoo haven. Gangster's paradise. Menacing stares and vulgar remarks. 

But after the tour was over, the faces of the incarcerated were no more than the faces of common men, faces of people like you and me, who for some reason or another ended up making a bad choice.

When I woke up that morning I actually hesitated a bit about going, willingly, to jail. 

If I had never been to jail and I never planned to, why would I go to a place where nobody really wants to end up? What is it about our voyeuristic society that drives us to actually want to visit an undesirable place just to see what it is like? Curious, I went anyway.

The tour that Don Sneed, journalism professor  arranged for some of his students was designed to present the realities of a county jail, or "correctional facility" as it was painted in bright yellow letters on the sign outside, even though there was nothing corrective about the way some of the inmates were handled. 

I expected a heavily guarded building with few windows. 

What we got was much different. A sixty-to-one inmate-to-guard ratio, for example.

The first inmates we met at the Stockade facility were the detainees of the military training unit, commonly called Boot Camp. 

These are first time non-violent offenders, ages 

16 - 35, who were given a chance to correct their behavior by submitting themselves to this training camp as opposed to serving full sentences for the crimes they committed.

They expected a 4 a.m. wake-up call, drill instructors shouting in their faces, and grueling physical training - all part of the first stage of Boot camp. "Breaking down" is what it is called.

"Chin all the way up, son!" a drill instructor shouted at one of the detainees doing pull ups on a monkey bar. The rest lined up behind them, waiting for their turn. Shaved heads glistened in the sun. Sweaty faces scanned the tour group with inquisitive looks.

It was not until I saw the razor wire growing out of the walls and roofs like wild vines that I actually understood where I was. "We give them no chance to escape by keeping them training all day," said Sergeant John Dlugos, one of our tour guides.

Every single minute dictated. Every move controlled. No room for mistakes in here. Just shouting and obeying. They all shared this common look of hating every second of their day, of not wanting to be there, of regret, anger and sadness.

While their exhausted bodies bended in need of air, I wondered if any of this would make them change their evil ways. Is this enough to turn a lawbreaker into a normal member of our society? And what is normal anyway? 

Some of the detainees, especially the younger ones, are serving time for things like driving without a driver's license. 

I remember being 16 and driving to the grocery store two blocks away without a license. 

Had I been caught would I have ended up here? And how would that experience have changed my life?
We left the detainees at the obstacle course to visit another building that houses individuals who are yet to be sentenced: They are awaiting a court date, but most have committed more serious crimes than those at Boot Camp.

While it was not Alcatraz, the perfectly square grey building gave the sensation of hiding something within. The cold, concrete block of the outside walls was just a preview of the reality behind them.

The mint smell of cleaner that tries hard to hide other smells. The flashin fluorescent light. Visitation rooms. Plexiglas windows revealing faces which, I admit, scared me a little. 

Three bologna slices, three slices of white bread, and two cookies: not exactly a business lunch. It was just all starting to fit in. 

The mold was broken, and the stereotype of a regular county jail with bars and sheriff's deputies with their feet propped up on desks started to disappear.

Headline: Playing pool with world politics
Subheadline: United States doesn't play fair; pushes war
Author: John Colagrande Jr. / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Iraq, you rack; it's just a game, right? 

Right. We're the stars 'n' stripes. We've already dropped England, Italy and most of NATO in our pockets. 

We just have to sink Germany, France and Belgium before we can knock out the eight ball. 

There are some other balls on the table: a fledgling economy, Dick Cheney and the Enron scandal, the World Com fiasco, al Qaeda, bin Laden, Afghanistan, unemployment, escalating oil prices, and an incompetent administration that is ignoring all domestic issues that don't deal with defense, but we don't want to hit those balls. 

This is how the game is played. We want to leave those balls on the table untouched.  

Is this the strategy that the Republican administration seems to think will win them re-election? If it is it could work. 

In wartime, a president always has high approval ratings. It would be considered "unpatriotic" to feel any other way toward the leader of our country. 

After Sept. 11 and during the war with Afghanistan Bush's approval ratings were in the 90 percentiles. War is good politics. Karl Rove and the other Republican strategists know this. 

An ideal situation for President Bush would be to begin a long crusade against Iraq that takes America into the pending election year with him riding high on post-war approval ratings. 

After a successful mission against Iraq, which likely would be the case, Bush's approval ratings figure to be very high. 

It would be better for Bush if the war was fought closer to the election because it doesn't seem as if the American public would tolerate a long drawn out crusade against Iraq. 

That leads to one of the interesting enigmas around the impending war: Why now? Why not last year or four years ago? 

Is it because just now Iraq has the capabilities of producing weapons of mass destruction? No. 

Perhaps now is the time for war because of the other balls on the table. The administration doesn't want those balls to be dealt with. 

When was the last time anybody barked about Enron, World Com or bin Laden?  

The main fear is that Saddam Hussein and Iraq may have biological weapons of mass destruction that they intend to use. 

Despite the fact that there is no evidence that Iraq plans to use such weapons, our actions would be less hypocritical if the United States didn't give Iraq biological viruses in the '80s in their fight against Iran. 

We gave Iraq weapons of war. Our gifts essentially lead to the beginning of Iraq's bio terror program. 

We gave them biological weapons just like we funded bin Laden in his earlier crusades against Russia. 

What does accountability mean? What does credibility mean? What does it matter that most of the world is really against us on this one? 

And what does it matter that we're being depicted as a bunch of gun slinging, tobacco chewing, cowboy warmongers abroad, while at home we're cutting taxes for the rich and accumulating a national debt that will put, among other things, social security at risk? 

I don't know, man. You wanna rack? I - don't wanna - Raq. 

Whatever happened to a friendly game of pool?

Headline: In Our View: FIU Divided
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
More than 100 FIU students mounted buses and rode to Tallahassee to protest the possible elimination of the Bright Futures Scholarship program last Thursday.  There, they met with 500 students who came from other universities throughout the state for the same purpose.  

FIU had one of the strongest turnouts. Over a sixth of the students protesting came from FIU, the school furthest from the state capitol - a representation challenged only by the local Florida State University.

For that, we have SGA to thank. Their mobilization of the student body was directly responsible for the strong turnout that brought Lt. Gov. Frank T. Brogan out of his office and before the protesting students.  

Though we may not know now what future lies ahead for Bright Futures, we know that our student body has done what it can to protect the program.

But we must still wonder about what could have been.

While we recognize that it was no small task to get 100 FIU students to Tallahassee, precious time was wasted in a pitiful waiting game that caused more harm than good as staffers for both student government presidents failed to reach one another and plan FIU's involvement in Thursday's rally.

As a result of the never-ending game of cross-county phone tag, Biscayne Bay and University Park planned their trips separately and SGA squandered a perfect opportunity to unite more students under one banner to speak with one voice and declare their support for Bright Futures. Instead of having Biscayne Bay's students march from FSU to the capitol by themselves, all 100 of FIU's students could have marched as a collective entity had BBC President Adrian Carter and UP President Jessica Morffi had put aside their apparent penchant for delegation long enough to pick up a telephone.

If both student leaders are not willing to bridge the physical gap between both campuses for a rally taking students 520 miles to Tallahassee, how can we as students depend on them to unite the next time a critical issue arises? We pay a lot of lip service to FIU being one university and not two campuses, and clearly our student leaders have wasted an opportunity to back that up with action.

WEDNESDAY -	
	
Bright Futures Rally
The meeting began with discussion concerning the final preparations for the Tallahassee trip that the BBC Student Government Association is participating in as a member of the Florida Student Association.

Communication problems
Adrian Carter, BBC Student Government Council president, brought up the issue of poor communication between the UP and the BBC student government councils.
He stressed the need to have better communication with UP Student Government and said "if we are not communicated to, that also should be communicated."
"We need to make sure that the avenues of communication are always open," he said.
Carter also raised the concern that there are condom vending machines installed at BBC even though BBC-SGC voted against it.
"It's a violation of what we voted on," Carter said.
"Our Student Government Council voted against something, yet what the University Park Council voted on is still pushed onto our campus," he said.

Election process change 
Representative at Large Admatha Israel and Housing Representative Sheaon Reid introduced two resolutions at this week's meeting.
The first resolution, approved by a vote of 6-to-3, amends section one of the elections code as of February 17, 2003 to allow  student government presidential and vice presidential candidates to run on one ticket.

Council against denying financial aid to drug offenders
The second resolution, approved by a unanimous vote with the exception of one abstention, states, "The Student Government Council of Biscayne Bay Campus supports Mr. Barney Frank's H.R. 786 which opposes legislation that denies or delays college financial aid to persons with drug convictions." 
The resolution was presented at the meeting with a copy of a CNN.com article entitled "The New Politics of Pot" attached to it.

Headline: Campus Life office moves, gets face-lift
Author: Shamara Allen/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
School spirit is a top priority for Biscayne Bay Campus leaders in 2003. With over $150,000 invested in the newly relocated and completely renovated Campus Life office, administrators and student government officials are optimistic about the future.

"We are trying to make the Wolfe University Center the hub of student activities here at the Biscayne Bay Campus," Brian Haynes, assistant vice president of Student Affairs said. "[Relocating] Campus Life was the first step."

The Campus Life office was moved from the third floor of the WUC building to its current location in WUC 141, where the old game room was located.

 "That was the only location whose size was close to that of our previous office," David Cole, assistant director of Campus Life and Orientation, said.

Visibility and accessibility were factors in deciding where to move the office. 

 "Most students didn't know we had a Campus Life office. Most weren't aware that there was anything on the third floor except for the gym," Cole said.	

"Students are more likely to be involved in campus activities if they are easily accessible," Haynes said.

"It's definitely accessible. You can walk in at anytime," Zoila Rivera, Campus Life student assistant, said.

"I see no disadvantage to the new location of the Campus Life Office," Haynes said.  "We know that involved students have a higher retention rate than those students [who aren't involved]. There has already been a noticeable increase in students accessing campus life services."

 "There is a flow of students passing through all the time," Tricia Baldeosingh, Campus Life graduate student assistant, said.

The new office houses major student organizations: Student Government Council, Student Programming Council, Student Organizational Council, Student Council Internship Program and Panther Power, allowing each of them to have a workroom for their staff. The rooms are equipped with enough computers and workspace for the staff of the organizations.

"Before, we only had one computer, and it was kind of hard to work with just one computer," Rivera said. "It's more of a business type-setting now and not so relaxed." 

The new office location also gives Campus Life members easier access to events. 

"When we have our events, most of them are located in Panther Square,"Baldeosingh said. "[The new office] is very accessible, as compared to having to [run up] to the third floor." 

To show off its new office, Campus Life is holding an open house Feb. 19 from 12 p.m. - 2 p.m. Students, faculty and staff are welcome to attend.

Headline: Grant brings experienced journalists to FIU
Author: By Sara Blumenthal
&nbsp;
Charlotte, North Carolina reporter Julie Aguirre found herself in Miami one week late January. She was not there for a story or on vacation. Instead, she traveled to the Sunshine State to give journalism students at Biscayne Bay Campus a firsthand account of what it really means to be a professional broadcaster.

FIU's School of Journalism and Mass Communication has partnered with Charlotte's WBTV in order to connect students with professionals in the business. This is made possible through the Broadcasters-in-Residence Program, a grant project supported by the Association of Schools of Journalism and Mass Communication.

"It takes the classroom experience and extends it beyond the class into real life," Amanda Hoffmann, junior and print journalism major, said.

The Broadcasters-in-Residence Program is an annual program available to all accredited schools of journalism, though it was only awarded to 10 schools. Each school chosen then picked a broadcast station to partner up with. The professionals from each station will visit the schools between September and May. 

"It is helping students in their future careers," said Mike McQueen, chairperson of the journalism school. He said that the program achieves the two goals of the School of Journalism: " to better educate our students and improve journalism."

This is the second time that the School of Journalism received this specific grant.  This year, FIU was given $11,000 to compensate for the travel expenses of the professionals.

So far two members of the WBTV team in Charlotte have traveled down to speak to FIU journalism students: News Producer Paige Tatum and Reporter Julie Aguirre. In March, Assistant News Director Angela Robbins and Photographer Richard McKinney will also come down.

Professor Cheryl Berry, faculty member in charge of the program, said that the program is important because it allows students to work closely with those involved in the day-to-day business of broadcast television. Berry said she chose the Charlotte station as a partner because she worked there previously and knew it to be a good station. 

"It is also different from Miami; it's important for students to see the different markets," Berry said. 

The students also learn from the speakers. 

"It gives us a perspective on what to expect [in the real world]," Erika Mayor, a junior and broadcast journalism major, said. 

The students are able to approach people who might one day be their coworkers. 

"They ask questions from the person's salary to how their personal life is affected by their careers," Berry said.

Professor Don Sneed especially appreciates the perspective the speakers give to the students. 

"They tell it like it is," Sneed said. "I can tell the students what the salaries are, but until they hear from someone in the business they won't believe me."

"Getting to hear [their] impression of starting out is helpful. It brings some realism to the field," said journalism major Isis Iglesias.

Headline: BBC career fair creates interview opportunities
Author: Mary Jo Morrell/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If sleepless nights of cramming have left you wondering what your Writing Strategies or Business Administration course has to do with the real world, then the Biscayne Bay Campus Career Fair is the place for you. 

The Wolfe University Center Ballroom will be transformed into a candy store for the unemployed from 11 a.m. - 4 p.m. on Feb. 26. The first comprehensive Career Fair at BBC is open to all majors, but will focus on schools located on the campus, including Arts and Sciences, Journalism and Mass Communication, Criminal Justice, Nursing, Health and Urban Affairs and Business Administration.

"[The fair] is one opportunity for students to connect with potential employers on a face-to-face basis," Craig Cunningham, associate director of career services at BBC, said. 

Some of these employers include Mercy Hospital, The Sun Sentinel, Union Planters Bank, Miami-Dade County Parks and Recreation and various branches of the United States military. 

Companies attracted to FIU - which recently ranked among the top 100 national public universities by U.S. News and World Report - are still registering, and a more current list is accessible through a link on the Career Services website, www.fiu.edu/~career.

Though part-time and full-time positions are available for students who show potential and are eager to work hard, even students not currently in the job market are encouraged to attend in order to get a feel for what's out there. 

"The flyer my friend gave me said a couple of news stations are going to be there, so I'm going to see if I can get an internship" said Michael Dill, a junior majoring in print journalism.

"I didn't even know there was [a career fair]," said freshman Ludovica Virgile. "Now that I do, I think I'll drop by if I'm around."

Even freshmen and sophomores unsure of their career plans are encouraged to attend because representatives from other FIU programs and offices will be available to answer questions. These include the Law and Graduate schools; the Office of International Studies for students interested in educational and internship opportunities in other countries; and the Office of Alumni Affairs, whose members can provide advice based on personal experience.

Students planning to attend the fair should prepare in advance, Career Services Coordinator Claudia Reich said. 

"It's important to dress in professional business attire," Reich said. 

For men, a shirt and tie is acceptable, but a suit is preferred.  Women are advised to wear a simple conservative skirt or pant suit. Reich also suggests that students "leave their backpacks at home." Portfolios or binders, which can be purchased inexpensively at K-Mart or Office Depot, help to create a more positive first impression, Reich said.

"What are these portfolios for?" students may wonder. The answer lies in one of the key elements of getting hired: a good resume.

 "After the last Career Fair at the University Park campus, many employers complained that resumes were not printed on professional quality paper," Cunningham said. Because recruiters scrutinize details many students never even consider, students should make an effort to have their resumes critiqued individually by an adviser from the Career Services Office, she said. 

Anyone who wishes to take advantage of this service can call Career Services at (305) 919-5770 or drop by WUC 255 to schedule an appointment. 

In addition, a workshop will be offered on Feb. 20, at the Career Services Office to help students prepare for the fair. Entitled "How to Work a Career Fair," the session will focus on what employers look for in job applicants. 

"When you have a sea of students, you want to be able to stand out," Kelly Blaze, an Enterprise Rent-A-Car recruiter who will speak at the workshop, said.

Headline: Banks leads FIU to win, team now ranked No. 25
Subheadline: Baseball continues winning streak
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers cracked the top 25 poll for the first time this year. After defeating UCF last week, the Golden Panthers were ranked No. 25 in the Collegiate Baseball Poll. The team remained unranked in the Baseball America poll.

FIU 4, FAU 0

Wednesday night was a pitchers duel in Boca Raton as FIU knocked off the Owls of FAU, 4-0. Junior Josh Banks shut out FAU after going eight innings, striking out nine and walking one.  FAU's Danny Core had 23 total strikeouts and three walks.

Skip Adams hit his second homerun of the season in the top of the second inning to give the Golden Panthers the early lead.

The battle between Banks and Core continued as both players held their opponents to minimal success at the plate. 

Core struck out two and got another out on a bunt attempt, and Banks struck out three straight to preserve the lead. At the end of three, each pitcher had five strikeouts.

At the end of the fourth, Banks had seven strikeouts, allowed two hits and had yet to give up a walk. 

In the top of the fifth, Core struck out two more Golden Panther batters, and got Rivera to pop out. 

At the end of five innings Core had thrown eight strikeouts and also had yet to allow a walk.

But the pitchers continued to duke it out with neither one missing a beat. Banks once again retired the side without much difficulty. Both Banks and Core  dominated in the sixth to set up what would turn out to be an unusual seventh inning.

Core gave up his first base on balls of the contest, walking Adams to begin the inning. Freshman Yahmed Yema laid a sacrifice bunt down the left field line, advancing Adams to second base. After  Michael New went down on strikes, Rivera hit a single to left field. 

Then came the controversy.

Adams attempted to reach home on the play, but Owl catcher Robert Orton blocked the plate. Adams ran into Orton, subsequently knocking the ball loose from the catcher's grasp. Adams was credited with the run. FAU coaches and players protested that Adams should have slid.
Home plate Umpire Phil Martucci conferred with the other umpires before ruling that the run would stand. Both head coaches were informed.

"We were told at the beginning of the year to run through when the play is close," Adams said. "We're taught to just play hard in that situation. One guy wins, and one guy loses."

Once play resumed, sophomore Dennis Diaz closed out the scoring in the seventh by hitting an RBI single to left center. Ramirez got to third and rounded the base to come home after an error by the Owl second baseman. 

Banks pitched the next two innings, giving up no hits and striking out one more FAU player. Core was removed from the game after the eighth inning.

Edgar Ramirez finished the game for FIU, striking out three  batters in consecutive order in the ninth inning to secure the win for the Golden Panthers.

Banks improves to 1-0 in three starts for the year. He has pitched 22 innings and boasts a 0.00 ERA.   

"Josh (Banks) was really sharp tonight," FIU Head Coach Danny Price said. "We're pleased to get this win."

FIU 8, Siena 1

FIU defeated Siena for the second time in two days Saturday afternoon in a home matchup. Mario Monreal went 1-for-3 with a run scored and brought  in two runs in his second start of the year. 

FIU 17, Siena 5

On Sunday afternoon, Skip Adams went 4-for-4 with six runs batted and scored, as the Golden Panthers raised the scoreboard in every inning. In the first two innings, FIU acheived eight runs.

The game was also characterized by junior pitcher Andrew Edwards, who was just added to the Golden Panther lineup. Starting in his first appearance of the season, the right-hander allowed only two hits, no runs and struck out three in two innings of work.

Un dolor de estómago ha visitado a Diane Rehm a lo largo de seis décadas. Aparece de súbito pero siempre por las mismas razones: es el dolor de los nuevos comienzos, los retos insospechados, los altibajos de la vida y esa vocecita interna que le dice: &#8220;Diane, tú no eres lo suficientemente buena para lograr tus objetivos&#8221;. 

Para contrarrestar el dolor, Diane no ha dependido de antiácidos ni de los odiados enemas que su madre acostumbraba aplicarle cuando la enfermedad rondaba su organismo. Tampoco ha ignorado su padecimiento, como si se tratase de un molesto huésped que no merece su atención.

El alivio de Diane se relaciona más con una visión realista de la vida que con píldoras e inyecciones. A sus 66 años, ella está lista para compartirnos su secreto en medio de la prisa cotidiana que le imprime su carrera como anfitriona del programa radial &#8220;The Diane Rehm Show&#8221;, el cual es transmitido para un millón de radioescuchas en los Estados Unidos por National Public Radio y distribuido por satélite a Europa, Africa, China y al Lejano Oriente.

&#8220;Todos enfrentamos desafíos de uno u otro tipo. Algunos parecen más grandes para el mundo exterior. Sin embargo, necesitamos aceptar esas limitaciones, sin dejarnos limitar por ellas, y seguir haciendo lo que nos gusta y lo que deseamos hacer&#8221;, dice Diane, al tiempo que sus ojos color avellana buscan la confirmación de John, el abogado de Washington con quien hace 42 años se unió en matrimonio y procreó dos hijos.

Su secreto, que ella insiste en no llamarlo &#8220;fórmula mágica&#8221;, parece obvio a simple vista. Pero éste le ha funcionado a una mujer que ha pasado por las hondonadas del maltrato infantil, el silencio de su madre como castigo, las restricciones impuestas por su origen árabe, la muerte de sus padres a una temprana edad, un divorcio, un segundo matrimonio que ha oscilado entre la discordia y el afecto, una carrera sin título universitario, el sentimiento de baja autoestima y, más recientemente, el diagnóstico de disfonia espasmódica, un trastorno neurológico que afecta sus cuerdas vocales y amenaza con sacarla de las ondas radiales. 

De esta colección de experiencias, lágrimas, victorias y soledades trata su autobiografía Finding my voice (&#8220;Encontrando mi voz&#8221;), publicada en 1999 por Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. 

&#8220;Escribir ese libro fue fácil para mí. Fue como escribirle una carta a una amiga&#8221;, dice Diane.

Alta, delgada, elegante y de facciones fuertes que revelan sus raíces libaneses-egipcias, el encanto de Diane se conjuga con su redacción clara, sencilla, cálida y honesta. En uno de los capítulos más emotivos de su autobiografía, Diane confiesa el horror que sintió en 1998 cuando los cambios de su voz se tornaron más notorios, tanto para ella como para sus colegas de WAMU-FM (88.5), la estación radial de American University en donde se inició como productora voluntaria y ascendió a anfitriona de su propio programa. 

&#8220;Durante esos meses no me preguntaba &#8216;¿por qué yo?&#8217; sino, &#8216;¿por qué ahora?&#8217;&#8221;, escribió Diane, en referencia a esa voz ronca y entrecortada que salía de su garganta, justo cuando su carrera de 20 años estaba sobrepasando sus expectativas.

Y es que Diane ha mantenido una radiorevista existosa, caracterizada por conversaciones animadas, pero respetuosas, sobre una variedad de temas. Entre sus invitados han figurado los ex-presidentes Jimmy Carter y Bill Clinton, la ex-secretaria de Estado Madeleine Albright, el violinista Isaac Stern y el poeta E. Ethelbert Miller. Increíble pero cierto en el caso de una mujer que nunca fue a la universidad ni recibió un entrenamiento formal en el mundo de la radiodifusión.

Pero, con la sombra de un padecimiento inesperado y sin tener un diagnóstico seguro, Diane se tomó cuatro meses de descanso. No fue una decisión sencilla. No obstante, lo que ocurrió ese 23 de febrero de 1998 desató las amarras de sus debilidades.

&#8220;(Para calmar la ansiedad) esa mañana me tomé una pequeña dosis de Prozac líquido, y una taza de café. Mi reacción fue extrema. Mi voz comenzó a temblar descontroladamente. Sabía que sonaba horrible, pero no había nada más por hacer que terminar las dos horas del programa&#8221;, recuerda Diane en su autobiografía. Esto fue la gota que derramó el vaso.

Sigue la lucha

¿Se daría por vencida Diane ante la pérdida paulatina de su voz, la desazón por no saber qué le ocurría, la acumulación de frustraciones conyugales y los fantasmas que intentaban acallarla desde su infancia?

John, a diferencia de otras etapas del matrimonio en las que se aislaba de su familia para concentrarse en su trabajo como abogado del Departamento de Estado, fue el bastón de Diane cuando la enfermedad azotó su ventana.  

&#8220;Estuve cerca de rendirme y de dejar mi amada carrera en la radio. Pero John siempre me animó a esforzarme y a buscar las respuestas&#8221;, dice Diane. 

Y así lo hizo. Por consejo de su médico internista, Diane recurrió a un neurólogo y a un otorrinolaringólogo en el hospital de la Universidad John Hopkins. Los Rehm escucharon ahí el diagnóstico que aliviaría la desesperanza. 

La enfermedad de Diane, aunque incurable, cuenta con un tratamiento efectivo basado en la inyección periódica de la toxina botulínica (Botox) en los músculos laríngeos. Esta permite controlar los síntomas distónicos en la mayoría de los pacientes.

&#8220;Recibí la última inyección el primero de junio. Siento que ya estoy llegando al punto en que necesito otra, pero la postergaré quizá hasta navidad (de 2002)&#8221;, afirma Diane, quien añade que después de cada inyección debe permanecer dos semanas fuera del aire, hasta que las cuerdas vocales retoman su vibración normal.

¿Qué la motiva a superar los obstáculos y a calmar ese dolor de estómago que los acompaña? Diane afirma que es una combinación de oportunidades y deseos, en la cual su esposo ha jugado un rol preponderante, como proveedor y animador. Pese a sus conflictos maritales, John, dice Diane, siempre la ha apoyado para alcanzar sus objetivos. 

El asiente y añade que hay quienes no superan sus dificultades porque no tienen las mismas oportunidades (monetarias) con las que ha contado Diane ni el aliento de sus familiares.

Precisamente de este tema hablan los Rehm en uno de los capítulos de su nuevo libro, Toward commitment, a dialogue about marriage (&#8220;Hacia el compromiso, un diálogo sobre el matrimonio&#8221;). 

Este trabajo es único en su género. Sus 26 tópicos reunen los ensayos que John y Diane redactaron independientemente y los diálogos que los sucedieron. No se les escapó ni un tema controversial para cualquier relación conyugal. Desde el sexo, el dinero y la religión, hasta la familia política, la crítica malsana y la necesidad de sicoterapia, los Rehm abundan en detalles íntimos que hacen de su libro una evaluación del matrimonio &#8220;desde adentro&#8221;, a diferencia del enfoque profesional y hasta objetivo de los tomos escritos por terapeutas y consejeros familiares.  

Por su sinceridad, los Rehm recibieron las felicitaciones de sus amigos y lectores en Miami, durante la Feria Internacional del Libro, el pasado 23 de noviembre. 

&#8220;En salud o en enfermedad&#8221;, la resolución de Diane de permanecer unida a John no es fortuita. Viene atada a un costal lleno de dolores, pero también de esperanzas y sueños compartidos. 

&#8220;Cada quien debe seguir preguntando, trabajando y luchando por llegar a comprender y vivir con los temores y las dudas. El desafío es no rendirse, sin importar qué tan difícil nos parezca el recorrido&#8221;, concluye Diane, la mujer de los ojos avellana y la voz entrecortada, pero dulce y respetuosa.
