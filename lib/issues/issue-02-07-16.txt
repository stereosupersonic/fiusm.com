Headline: Former FIU star competes in first All-Star game
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Florida Marlins third baseman and former FIU standout Mike Lowell made his first appearance in major league baseball's All-Star game this past week. He was chosen as a reserve and saw some action in a game that was called by Commissioner Bud Selig a tie- in the 11th inning due to both teams running out of pitchers.

Lowell boasts a .311 batting average with 14 homeruns and 59 RBI's. He prides himself on delivering when the game is on the line. 

"My biggest asset is I know the game," Lowell said. "I know how to succeed in the [clutch] situations." 

Lowell is on pace to break two of his career highs this year. His bests of 22 homeruns in a season which he set in 2000 and the 156 hits he recorded in 2001.

Lowell, a survivor of testicular cancer, was originally drafted in the 20th round by the New York Yankees and named to the All-Conference team three times while at FIU. He founded the Mike Lowell Foundation Golf Classic in 2002. All proceeds from the tournament were given to the League Against Cancer. He continues with work to benefit the foundation.

Lowell is in his 5th professional season, fourth with the Marlins.

Headline: Athletics adds trio
Subheadline: Winick named Director
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Athletic director Rick Mello announced three new hires for his department this past week. Pauline Winick, Jan Allen, and John Newman have each accepted positions with the department's top management team. Allen and Newman both worked previously at the University. 

"I am thrilled to be able to attract the quality of Pauline, Jan and John and I have every confidence that they will make a significant impact on our program and university" Mello said. 

Winick will now move to the Athletic Department as Director of Football Marketing. Previously, she held a position in the university's External Relations Office working under Vice President Dale Webb. Winick holds the distinction of being the first woman ever to be named president of an NBA franchise, while she worked for the Miami Heat.

Allen, who's official title will be Associate Athletic Director for External Operations, will manage the Golden Panther Club, the booster organization for FIU athletics, that she previously managed from 1988-92. While at the helm, Allen helped raise membership to approximately 650. After leaving FIU, she went on to produce a 122-76 record in seven years as head coach of the women's basketball program at Barry University. 

Newman was an assistant controller and director of financial aid at FIU from 1976-80. He then became the Vice President of Information systems at Carnival Resorts and Casinos. He has been a technology consultant to the hospitality industry for the past three years. Newman will now be the athletic departments new business manager. 

"We are working very diligently to increase our presence in the community and adding to our external relations staff has been our goal for the past year," said Mello. 

"We're very fortunate to have them" Executive Vice President Paul Gallagher, who oversees athletics, said. "They will be a tremendous asset to athletics because they bring a tremendous amount of experience to the university."

Headline: Pro sports unity in eye of the beholder
Author: Tom E. Curran, Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
This actually happened on an NBA team in the not-too-distant past.

A white player arranged to have a man in a gorilla suit wear the jersey of a black teammate. The gorilla worked in a used-car lot  a used-car lot that the white player knew was located on the way to the arena. Naturally, everyone on the team bus saw the gorilla.

So what happened next?

(A) The white player still hasn't been found.

(B) The white player still hasn't come out of sensitivity training.

(C) The white player is in the Hall of Fame and considered one of the greatest players and teammates of all time.

The answer is ``C.'' Larry Bird, the white player who gave the jersey of black teammate Quinn Buckner to the aforementioned gorilla, went out and led the Celtics to a 125-121 win in Game 4 of the 1984 NBA Finals that night. The Celtics evened a series they eventually won.

Ironically, Bird's gag which could have very well led to bloodshed on another team was a kind of apology. Just days earlier, Bird had said his teammates played like sissies in losing to the Lakers by 33.

"We knew we didn't do our jobs in Game 3 and Larry used that sissy 
comment as a motivator," said former Celtic M.L. Carr. "When he paid the equipment guy to put the Quinn Buckner jersey on that gorilla in California, he knew it would break us up. We weren't the kind of team that would take it any other way. There was nothing racial about it. Calling us sissies and then pulling that joke was all a part of a psychological game."

Great teams are united. And the chemistry and unity that every team has shows itself in dozens of ways. Recall the routine image of Dan Marino sneering at a Dolphins receiver who he felt had run the wrong route. Or Georgetown coach John Thompson putting his arm around Fred Brown after he'd committed a game-blowing turnover in the 1982 NCAA Final. Or Jeff Kent fighting with Barry Bonds in the Giants' dugout just weeks ago. Or Antoine Walker getting in the face of Paul Pierce before the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Pistons earlier this year, helping to spur a history-making comeback by the Celtics. Or Larry Bird turning what could have been viewed as a vile insult into a tension-breaking joke.

The chemistry within a team, which is usually fostered by either a star player or coach, manifests itself in a kind of team personality.

Even though the A's and Yankees of the `70s fought amongst themselves, there was always a powerful team personality that put on-field excellence at the top of its pyramid for success.

Even though many Green Bay Packers loathed the way they were treated by Vince Lombardi, that dynamic between coach and team hatched a dynasty. With the Bad Boy Pistons, it was them against the league.

At the very core of team chemistry is togetherness. A team united against a dictatorial coach can find success. A team united because of the loss of a superstar like the Mariners of the last few seasons after the trades of free-agent defections of Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson and Alex Rodriguez, or the Patriots after Drew Bledsoe went down can find success. Something, though, has to touch off the unity.

One week last fall, a modest table was set up at the back corner of the of the Patriots locker room. It was located hard by the players' showers. On Mondays, the doctor who takes urine samples for league-sponsored drug testing would sit there and read the paper and wait for his samples. One day, a few players began playing dominoes there. Charles Johnson, Otis Smith, a few others. As the days passed, more players got involved Ty Law, Lawyer Milloy. The games began to get raucous and seemed to serve as a kind of safe haven as the media swarm made its way around the room. As it happened, the dominoes players all were black.

Then one day, fullback Marc Edwards was seen playing. Edwards is white.

Anyone who says sports is a color-blind utopia where race goes unnoticed has never taken a look around a professional locker room. White players generally hang with white players and blacks gravitate to blacks. Or at least that's what your eyes will tell you. But this domino game got more integrated, more familial and stayed just as raucous.

The Patriots have a massive new locker room at CMGi Field. It's a leather-recliner type of locker room, a place unlike the one at Foxboro Stadium where a player can signal his status within the team by the way he chooses to outfit his space.

The room sprawls. The forced closeness of the old place has been replaced by luxury.

Except for one thing.

On the last day of mini-camp, in front of Otis Smith's locker, there was a table. And there, on beautiful day last month, Smith, a black defensive back, and Mike Vrabel, a white linebacker, played dominoes.

Headline: Daniel Brizard named women's soccer assistant
Author: BEACON STAFF REPORT
&nbsp;
Head coach Everton Edwards announced the hiring of assistant coach Daniel Brizard. Brizard comes from the University of South Alabama, where he has spent the past two seasons at the same position.

Headline: Athletic camps provide skills, fun
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Summer is a time where everything slows down. It's the warmest season of the year encompassing the dog days of August, lazy days at the beach, baseball, barbeques, endless periods of rain and, for some parents' sake, summer camps.

Except at FIU, the summer camps are not your typical "Koombaya" singing, poison ivy contracting and marshmallow roasting kind of summer camp, well one of the camps does involve marshmallows, but more on that later.

The summer sports camps at FIU are different from the typical summer camps in that they teach the campers the skills and knowledge needed to play that particular sport while at the same time making sure they're having fun doing so.

"These camps are a wonderful outlet for kids to get a break from the classroom," FIU head baseball coach Danny Price said.  "Little leagues can be stressful these days and we're not stressful at all here.  It's a relaxed environment where these kids can learn the right way to play the game."

Price, who has been running his baseball sports camp for "20 something years" and has also been running the baseball program for 23, sees the FIU camps as a way to get involved with the community.

"It's a great way to give back to the community and to meet people," Price added.  "Baseball is such a great sport and there are so many parents looking for proper instruction these days. We try to do our best and hopefully they come back and support your program later on."

The six sports camps average about 50 campers a week, ages ranging from six to fifteen. What sets Price's camp apart from others are the indoor batting cages. 

 "There's mostly bad weather down here during the summer and the parents can't do much with their kids so it's an advantage to have the indoor cages," said Price who recorded his 900th career victory in the 2002 season.  "But what you hope the kids most take out of all this is the right attitude.  Everything in life begins with the right attitude and you need that attitude to develop the right playing abilities." 

The right playing abilities are also a primary focus of FIU volleyball camp, head coach Cookie Stevens said.

Stevens, like Price, has been running her camps for twenty plus years while at Miami-Dade Community College and Westminster Christian High School.

 "The camps give us a chance to provide exposure for FIU," Stevens said.  "It may be a hope for future recruits.  We nurture the kids and hopefully when they grow up they may want to be FIU volleyball players."

Stevens,  the 2001 American Volleyball Coaches Association South Region Coach of the Year, takes a hands on approach to her camps along with the assistance of both her current and former players. Under her direction, the 2001 squad finished with a 24-8 record and a Sun Belt Conference Championship before being eliminated by the University of Florida in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. It was the furthest the team has ever advanced.

The camps specialize in teaching specific volleyball skills and build on those with a lot of repetition.

"What I hear from a lot of the campers is that one of the reasons they like our camp so much is that we'll stay on a certain skill and work with it different ways instead of moving on quickly to another," Stevens said.

Apparently, the campers must like what Stevens is doing because the camp draws about 100 kids per camp and they are all sold out.  Volleyball hasn't had this much attention since Tom Hanks' character spoke to Wilson the Volleyball in "Cast Away."

Sareh Seyedkazemi, a former FIU volleyball player and now a coach at the camp, believes Stevens' volleyball camp can have a lasting impression on the youngsters.

"The fact that the camp is run by a Division I college coach gives the kids a feel of authenticity," Seyedkazemi said.  "The kids get exposed to so much that they get a taste and that leaves them hungry and wanting to practice more."

"You learn so many different levels of fundamentals here that it will only take your game to a higher level," high school senior and camp participant, Natasha Schaefer said.

Kim Gywdir's FIU Girls Softball Camp also aims to take the camper's game to another level. Gwydir challenges her campers in the same manner as her players. 

Gwydir, the first and only coach in the softball programs history, hopes her camp improves the game of softball players  in South Florida by focusing on the instruction and development of certain skills.

 "It's fun to see the girls grow and watch them improve," camp director and assistant FIU softball coach Sara Headley said.  "But the camp also helps to improve the quality of softball in the area.  A 12 year old said the other day 'I want to play for FIU' and that's fun to see."

Gywdir's camp gets a turnout of about 30 to 40 for the limited space the softball field provides and the campers come from as far as Key West and even Georgia.

Keeping with the whole summer camp spirit, Gwydir provides marshmallows for her campers, but in a non-traditional way.

 Instead of roasting marshmallows at home plate, Gywdir has her campers play marshmallow softball, a simple, sweet game with only one rule.  

When a batter puts the ball in play, the fielder who catches the ball has to run to the pitcher's mound and eat a marshmallow before the batter circles around the bases to score a run.  If the fielder doesn't swallow the marshmallow before the batter crosses home plate, then the run scores.

"It's something different we came up with to change things up a bit," Gywdir said.  "You've got to remember it is summer camp and it's a time for kids to have fun."

In one camp, the kids learn pitching and catching. In another, Gwydir provides all the other softball skills such as base running, hitting, and fielding.

Headley hopes the nuturing environment of the camps allow kids to take away more than what they came with.

"I hope they leave with all the skills we teach them, especially throwing," Headley said.  "Most kids don't throw correctly and that's a big part of softball.  If each kid can take one thing with them that we taught them, then that would be great."

Headline: Omaghomi shoots thief
Subheadline: Former student body president will not be charged in shooting
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Biscayne Bay's former student government president shot an attempted robber six times outside his North Miami apartment complex last Thursday.

Tito Omaghomi, who was Student Government Council president from 1999-2001 shot Terry Orlan Campbell at 1 a.m. after Campbell pointed a gun at Omaghomi, yelling "Give it up," in an attempted robbery, according to a North Miami Police Department offense report.

Omaghomi fought Campbell at the 1487 N.E. 18 Ave. apartment complex and Campbell's "blue/black" gun fell during the scuffle. Omaghomi then pulled out his semi-automatic pistol and shot Campbell, a Pembroke Pines, Fla. resident.

Omaghomi told police "I called; I shot," when they first arrived on the scene.

Police believe Campbell carried a .38-caliber pistol.

Campbell, will be charged with armed robbery and the use of a firearm during a felony.

Omaghomi, who has not returned The Beacon's calls for comment, will not likely be charged for having a gun without a permit.

Twanna Mullins, who identified herself to North Miami Police as Omaghomi's girlfriend, said Omaghomi called her immediately after the shooting "screaming at her to call the police," according to the police report.

Police say Mullins did indeed call 911 for help.

When North Miami Police arrived at the scene, they found a bloodied Campbell asking for help. Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue took Campbell to Jackson Memorial Hospital's Trauma Unit.

Police believe Campbell will survive.

In 1996, Miami-Dade Police arrested Omaghomi and charged him with resisting arrest without violence, a misdemeanor charge, and carrying a concealed weapon, a third degree felony.

Omaghomi pled no contest to both charges and received three years probation for the concealed weapons charge. His probation ended in 1999. That was also his first year as BBC president.

 At the beginning of his third term in office, the university's administration relieved him from his duties as president but would not specify why, citing the Buckley Amendment or FERPA Act of 1979, a federal law preventing universities and other educational institutions from disclosing a student's private information.

"I don't think it's too fair for the students," Omaghomi said last summer. "I'm in a position where students elect you. These are not student decisions."

Omaghomi, who claimed not to know the reasons for his removal at the time, has never said what FIU officials charged him with.

In the fall of 2001, the beginning of his third term as BBC student government president, he was replaced by his vice president, Adrian Carter. Carter won a second term earlier in the year, running unopposed for student government president.

Headline: Public relations students help publish 2002 hurricane guide
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For the past nine years, FIU's chapter of the Public Relations Students Society of America has published a booklet entitled "Get Ready" designed to guide Miami-Dade county through a major hurricane should one make its way onto Miami's shores.

 "A lot of people felt that there wasn't a resource where you could get all of the necessary information about what to do before, during and after a hurricane [if one threatened]," PRSSA President Nazly De La Rosa said. 

 Hurricane Andrew, which swept through South Florida in 1992 – only a year before the idea took shape – played a major role in influencing the guide's publication as well.

The pamphlet's services to the community are: assisting the Miami-Dade community, and thanks to it's availability online, assisting PRSSA members nationwide. The guide also serves as a recruitment tool for the club.

The booklet is available free-of-charge in the International Hurricane Center located in the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences building on the corner of Flagler Street and S.W. 107th Avenue.  On the Biscayne Bay Campus, a student can find the guide in the Academic II building in room 320.

Printed copies of the pamphlet are also available at Amoco stations across Miami-Dade and Broward counties.

The guide has also been available online for the past three years at www.fiu.edu/~getready. 

The 2001 guide was only available online because the club did not turn in paperwork for funding by the deadline, De La Rosa said. However there seems to be some confusion between De La Rosa and Valentin on why that happened.

"Last year's guide couldn't be produced in print because we weren't able to secure funding," she said. 

Get Ready 2002 project director Gina Valentin thought Amoco could not sponsor the book that year because of budget cuts within the company.

The majority of the funding for this year's booklet has been provided by the Amoco Oil company with additional provisions given by the American Red Cross, FIU's International Hurricane Center, the National Hurricane Center and the Miami-Dade Office of Emergency Management.

"The production of the print version of the 2002 guide costs between $25,000 to $35,000," Valentin, who is also PRSSA's vice president, said.

The guide itself provides a variety of options for anyone who lives in an at-risk area –  someone who lives close to the water or on particularly low-lying ground.

After a brief introduction providing little-known facts about hurricanes –  like their frequency in South Florida – a brief summary of the fundamentals of a hurricane and terms used when describing one is given.

An introduction to the Saffir-Simpson scale used by the National Hurricane Center to categorize the storms, based on wind speed, immediately follows.  

Next, the guide suggests items with which to equip one's home in terms of food, clothing, bedding and medicine should a hurricane be forthcoming. It also offers safety plans for valuable belongings such as boats, pets and businesses which can't always simply be packed up and stored in the back seat of one's car. This guide can also be useful for those living in an apartment or mobile home. 

One notable change since last year's editions are recommendations for shutters. Since last year's publication, the city has changed many of it's laws dealing with this precaution thus causing the guide to change along with it. 

Suggestions in the guide for pet owners, boat owners, and those who could salvage their property by using shutters provide outlets for people who previously would have just left these things the way they are now. 

Because of the sometimes overwhelming strength of the storms, many South Florida residents have no choice but to evacuate their residence regardless of how much they prepare. 

Get Ready 2002 provides a list of evacuation centers for all zip codes in the city of Miami-Dade and introduces readers to the Emergency Evacuation Assistance Program, which was developed by Miami's Office of Emergency Management.

This program is a registry for those that need help when an emergency evacuation is necessary. It offers health-care and transportation to eligible residents.

"Anything that has to do with safety is helpful," Valentin said.

Concluding the book is a complete list of phone numbers a Miami-Dade resident might need at any point between the time when they first hear about a hurricane and the time they finish cleaning up after it has struck.

Most changes between last year's and this year's editons are in style. Sometimes laws regulating precautions change. For instance, since last year's publication, laws concerning shutters have changed. Thus so did the guide.

"We made slight changes but it's basically the same information as it had been when the publication first started," said Valentin. 

To make sure that the information is up-to-date, the Office of Emergency Management and American Red Cross compare last year's edition to this year's and searches for any changes that may have taken place.

PRSSA is a national organization whose goals include helping students find out about the public relations field, assisting them in their search for internships, and giving them information as to what a job in public relations entails. 

In addition to the Get Ready guide, the university's PRSSA has published "A Student's Guide to Public Relations Education," to "help students find out about the P.R. field, and educate them of the importance of internships," De La Rosa said.

Headline: Carmona denounces Chavez's actions
Author: Katia Fuminaya / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Pedro Carmona Estanga, who briefly held the highest office in Venezuela, spoke at the university last week. After the bloodless coup that ousted leftist President Hugo Chavez from office for about one day last April, the nation's military appointed Carmona president.

Although his tenure lasted for one day, the former head of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry left the country after announcing his own resignation. Chavez came back to power shortly thereafter.

Last week, Carmona spoke of what should have been done in Venezuela.

"What happened on April 11-12 wasn't a coup &#8211; rather it was an emptiness of power."

Carmona took time to address the wrong doings of Chavez's actions. He disapproved of the taking of war arms to the April 11-12 protest in Venezuela. Carmona described the act as a massive violation of human rights.

Carmona emphasized that the country needed, and continues to need, a "re-constitution" via consultation and citizen participation. 

Toward the end of the lecture, there was a question and answer session. Although Latin American and Caribbean Center Professor Eduardo Gamarra mentioned in his introduction that all speakers were invited including left wing and right wing speakers, the audience was not friendly to its opponent parties.

The audience waited for the question and answer  session before shouting "Chavista" and calling for Carmona's removal.

Carmona then stood up to point opponents toward the exit signs and out of the room.

The crowd became excited after Carlos Matamoros, 37 from "Hablando Claro, Miami" claimed that Carmona's remarks and acts were wrong, ironic and dishonest.

The crowd then called Matamoros a "Chavista," a supporter of Venezuela's current president.

Carmona did not answer all the questions students and staff asked but did grab the microphone to tell the audience that none of the comments made bothered him.

Today, Carmona is an exile living in Colombia. He claims his exile situation permits him to defend himself.

"I have plenty of time to work now," he said.

Headline: Letter to the editor:  Pledge column voices ignorant perspective
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

I read The Beacon online from time to time, but when I read David Pulgar's column on the ninth Circuit Court ruling on Newdow V. U.S. Congress, I thought this was one of the least considered, most jingoistic and ignorant opinions I have ever read. 

Much of the column I can forgive, for Pulgar is only voicing the opinion of a majority of Americans – something I tried to stay away from as opinion editor and columnist but did quite often myself. But to go as far as to say that the Pledge of Allegiance debate is "a waste of taxpayer money" is ridiculous. 

Mr. Pulgar, our courts are set up to debate and interpret the Constitution of the United States, and that is exactly what is being done in this case. 

Our Founding Fathers believed that the right to rule came from the people, and not from God. Monarchs and tyrants derive their legitimacy from God; we derive ours from the people. We are not one nation under God – we are one nation under nothing. Our power comes from within, not from above, or at least that is how we were conceived.   

Our courts have a mandate and a responsibility to make sure that our laws, our customs, and yes, the institutional manifestations of our culture strictly adhere to the original intent of our Founding Fathers, especially when it comes down to one of the most basic elements on which our nation is founded: the separation of church and state. 

If this debate is a waste of taxpayer money, then everything is, none of this is worth a damn, and perhaps we were wrong to try building a secular democratic republic in the first place.

Headline: Market's fall affects not only investors
Author: Heather McCalla
&nbsp;
Let me be honest about one thing: I don't know much about the stock market. I have a few shares of AT&T, which were purchased by my grandmother in my name, and to tell you the truth, I don't know much about those, either.

I come from a family of savvy business women, and I am the black sheep who knows nothing about the market. I have almost come to loathe going out to dinner because the subject always comes up, especially these days.

I am ashamed to admit this sort of ignorance, but it is the truth. It's not that I don't care; it's just not a top priority in my life right now. As a waitress working her way through school, I find I am far too busy to read articles written by professional journalists from  whom I should be learning in order to fulfill my goal of becoming a journalist, let alone read the business section to find out what my shares are earning (or, should I say losing?).

I am sure that students read the daily paper, but until we get out of school and land a full-time job in our fields that offer benefits such as stock options, how many of us are affected by the fact that the Dow Jones is down today? I'd say a small percentage. 

But then I rethink that theory. I realize that as a waitress my income solely depends on tips, and the fact of the matter is that the stock market does indeed effect how confident we feel about the economy. 

When people are unsure of the market, they simply stop spending. They stop shopping at the mall. They stop going out to eat. They stop supporting many students who work in retail stores and restaurants. I remember well that experience after Sept. 11 when people stayed shut in their houses, glued to the television, waiting to see how things were going to be played out. For weeks after, money was hard to get. I recall thinking that if something didn't change soon I would certainly have to drop out of school and look for a second job. 

Since that time, I have tried to make it a priority to know how the stock market is doing. Not necessarily to check my own shares, but more to check the weather forecast, so to speak.

Headline: "Under God" phrase fails to represent all Americans
Author: Andy Diaz
&nbsp;
I worship the Chair.  Not any chair in particular, but the idea of a seat as an object on which to assume the all-too-familiar seating position. I would go so far as to say that worshipping the Chair for me is a religious experience. The Chair is in fact the object around which I have based my religion, Chairism. (As a side note, I consider myself the most prominent messiah of Chairism.) Christians have God, Jews have Yahweh; the Muslims have Allah &#8211; I have the Chair.

Chair worshipping may seem like a pretty irrational concept to most of you out there who are used to the Abrahamic religions and probably even more so to atheists, but let me try and make my case to you. 

First of all, I can see, touch, smell, taste, and thanks to my buttocks friction against its surface &#8211; I can hear the Chair. This should cover the argument of whether or not I'm worshipping something that exists, I am &#8211; but we all knew that didn't we? 

More importantly, I worship the Chair because it provides comfort after a long day at work; it helps me assume the desired posture for playing guitar; and because it provides the needed support for the many daring, and yes, acrobatic, sexual positions I try with lady friends. 

Since God, Jehovah and Allah are either unwilling or unable &#8211; making a distinction between the two is irrelevant here so I will not try to do so &#8211; to provide these three basic services, I do not worship them. I'm sorry, but according to my standards they are not worship worthy.

I first found out that I was the only Chairist when I reached middle school and was made to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Although I wasn't really made to say it, I got dirty looks from the teacher and students if I didn't, so I just did &#8211; and realized that this pledge claimed our nation was under God. To me, our nation is not under God, but, rather, sitting on the Chair. 

For our country to be "one nation, under God," then everyone in said country has to believe there is a God and furthermore there would need to be some kind of physical evidence that this "God" not only exists but is also positioned above our nation.

There is a document that protects people like me from misleading statements like "under God." In today's attention deficit infected America, most people know the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as the one protecting freedom of speech, but it is much more than that. The first 10 words of this amendment read: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." This not only makes the "under God" statement misleading but also unconstitutional and un-American, proving wrong all those who claim this country was founded by God fearing people like Jerry Falwell (who for some reason is now giving away three Jeep Liberties on his website) and Joe Lieberman. 

Some, like David Pulgar, whose column ran in the last issue of The Beacon, claim the "under God" portion of the Pledge of Allegiance is too insignificant a violation of our Bill of Rights to pay any attention to since it would probably cost the taxpayers money in the form of court time. 

This is ridiculous. The funny thing about Pulgar's argument is how reminiscent it is of Northerners who prior to the Civil War believed that the emancipation of slaves and the ensuing war would cost taxpayers' money and lives and so slavery should be ignored.

The "under God" statement is by any rational argument unconstitutional and should be abolished. It implies that our nation as a whole is a nation of one kind of religion, monotheism, leaving out those who believe in more than one god or no god, or those like me who worship the Chair. 

In doing so, it violates the First Amendment of our Bill of Rights and, like most infringements upon our basic civil liberties, should not be ignored.

Headline: In Our View:  PRSSA should do more to avoid any future funding mishaps
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The Public Relations Student Society of America has been helping create free hurricane guides for Miami-Dade county residents for nine years.

In 2001, the club did not turn in papers asking Amoco Oil for funding, something the organization must do each year.

As a consequence, that year's guide was only found online. 

Although one could argue the number of people with Internet access has increased over the years, a certain sector of the population gets left out.

Certainly everyone in Miami-Dade deserves the chance to receive information on how to protect their children, themselves and their property should a hurricane strike the area.

Kudos should go to the students responsible for putting the guide out this year – they managed to accomplish that goal.

Because of the oil company's help, they are now able to distribute the guide at both FIU campuses and throughout the hundreds of Amoco stations across the county.

Not only did they file the paper work on time, but they also they also came up with a very handy booklet with detailed information on what to do to prepare for the storm and what to do afterward.

Let's just hope whomever is in charge of the 2003 book will remember to ask for funding on time.

Headline: In Our View:  FIU students, guests should be civil during on campus events
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
On April 11, Venezuela's military ousted the country's elected president from office. Shortly after Hugo Chavez's removal, Venezuela's military leaders asked Pedro Carmona Estanga, the president of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry to lead the nation on an interim basis.

For one day, Carmona was the country's leader. On April 12, he announced his resignation and Chavez regained his presidency. Carmona and the military leaders fled the country.

Fast forward three months and Carmona visits FIU as a guest of the university's Latin American and Caribbean Center where he delivers a speech on the current state of affairs of Venezuela.

After expressing disgust over the actions taken by Chavez during his presidency, one person in the croud calls Carmona's comments wrong, ironic and dishonest.

While everyone in the United States has been granted their freedom of speech by the United State's Constitution, people should learn to be tolerant of others' opinions.

Instead of calling Carmona a dishonest person and villifying his actions, the gentleman from "Hablando Claro, Miami" should have asked Carmona to explain his actions and his way of thinking.

The crowd, who came to Carmona's defense, must also think the same way. Instead of calling for the man's removal, he should have been ignored.

Child-like name-calling has no place in a university or in any other professional setting.

Headline: Mayer honors folk-rock traditions
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
I have an urge to write-off so called "singer songwriters" as just another derivative folk-rock act, despite my attraction to the genre.  But certainly, there's some basis for that. Former Soundgarden front-man Chris Cornell wasn't shy about admitting the obvious influences of Nick Drake and the ubiquitous Jeff Buckley on his solo debut Euphoria Morning. Duncan Sheik claimed the same influences, going so far as to borrow Matt Johnson, Buckley's drummer, for his sophomore effort Humming. As for Rufus Wainright, the Jeff Buckley influence is even more prevalent than the influence of his folk legend father Louden Wainright. By saying that, I don't mean to slight those artists.  Those records, for the most part, displayed finely crafted songwriting. Still, they were derivative.  

Enter Atlanta native John Mayer, the newest addition to the motley crew of "singer songwriters," with his album Room for Squares. The first time I heard his debut single, "No Such Thing," I was tempted to write it off as another "Barely Breathing": An addictive, saccharine-sweet folk-pop song, fluffy as Cool Whip and about as substantial. Catchy, aurally pleasant, but great? Like Sheik's "Barely Breathing," "No Such Thing" fronted an album with much more depth – more facets – than its first single could carry.

Right away, Mayer's voice is striking, if for no other reason than because he sounds so much like Dave Matthews in terms of tonality. It came as no surprise that John Alagia, who has production credits with Matthews and Ben Folds, served in that capacity for Mayer. But he doesn't sing like Matthews. He's comprehensible. He sings with a soporific tone reminiscent of Drake, occasionally soaring to a Sheik-like falsetto. Still, he avoids direct comparison. He doesn't try to compete with Drake's melancholy, or Sheik's balladry, or Jeff Buckley's angst-ridden, self-crucifying cries. Mayer remains his own man. 

Musically, the album is led by Mayer's voice, with his acoustic six-string work as its base. This folky foundation lays the groundwork for a grab bag of subjects, while still remaining consistent. Everything is pretty well represented here, from single-worthy tracks like "No Such Thing" and "Your Body Is a Wonderland" to wistful ballads like "City Love" and "St. Patrick's Day" to confessional pieces like "My Stupid Mouth" and "83."  

Lyrically, it's a fairly strong album, but you get the impression that the lyrics wouldn't work nearly as well if not for Mayer singing them. He seems to sell them with the sincerity of his tone and an innate talent for melody. They lack that poetic fluidity that would make them extraordinary lyrics.

It's not a perfect album. While lacking any obvious dogs, the album's consistency flirts with complacency. The album rarely plays with more complex arrangements than the simplicity of Mayer's voice and his guitar can provide. It comes off as almost lackadaisical. The tracks sometimes feel empty, even uninteresting, lacking in passion. It's as if they sat around the studio and thought: "Well, that was a pretty good take.  Let's call it a night." With the kind of space provided for by the simplicity of the songwriting, this album could have greatly benefited from some kind of arranging, an oversight further compounded by the successful use of string arrangements in "City Love."  

Overall, while it falls short of the monumental marks set by genre legends like Buckley, it is one of the more interesting releases to have come around in some time, and a pleasure to listen to.

Headline: "MIB2" alienates audiences
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Are testicles funny?This question is ultimately the deciding factor on whether "Men In Black 2" is the movie for you. If you find testicles funny, you may enjoy this movie. If you find testicles unamusing, you may not enjoy this movie. If you find the concept of testicles being used for a joke as sophomoric and juvenile, stay the hell away from this movie.

However, if immediately after reading the question, you went: "Oh my God! Look! They said testicles in the newpaper! I've got to show my friend Dave! Are testicles funny? You know it! Like in that scene in 'Joe Dirt' where the dog's 'nads get frozen to the porch, that was so funny!" then this movie is definitely for you.

As you can tell, I seem to be from the third category. Which really is a shame because I wanted to love "Men In Black 2." The first film was definitely an enjoyable flick that found an interesting comedy team in Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones (with the even more interesting aspect being that Smith played the straight man to Jones' dry humor). But since then Sonnenfeld has done no right, following up with bad movies ("Wild Wild West"), bad TV ("Maximum Bob"), mediocre TV ("The Tick") and a not-so-bad movie with bad timing that'll probably find an audience on cable ("Big Trouble"). And the trailers really did look promising for "Men In Black 2," so just what went wrong?

J (Smith) is a cocky Man In Black, a secret government agent who keeps the world safe from evil aliens on our planet. An evil alien called Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) comes to Earth looking for some mystical space macguffin so she can destroy our planet. J has to bring back K (Jones), a former agent who has been neuralized to forget he was an agent, to solve the case. They crack jokes, insult each other and act befuddled about all the aliens around them. 

Replace Boyle and her artificially enhanced breasts (my guess is CGI) with Vincent D'Onofrio and swap the character's situations (J is the newbie and K is the old-schooler) and we have the original movie. Again, just what went wrong?

To sum it up in a word: Everything. First of all, why would the audience want to sit through such a tepid rehash of the first movie, when the first one is readily available on video? And when I say tepid rehash, I mean, nothing new is brought to the story. There are no new aliens to deal with other than Serleena and other random baddies for J and K to fight with. Jeebs, the worms and Frank the pug are just given more prominent roles. 

The world they live in thus feels more compressed, almost as if this New York City consists of two blocks..In addition, the jokes are stale and the timing is always off. What could be excellent gags either drag on too long or don't last quite long enough. 

An example of both these cases is Frank the pug singing "I Will Survive." It plays out too long in the movie and follows a whopper of a bad joke and utterly fails. Yet, this same joke in the trailer gets a huge laugh. Why? It follows a good joke and is a few seconds shorter. I still watch the trailer and laugh at the joke. In the movie, all I could do was cringe.

And remember those testicles at the beginning of this review? Well, they're in reference to an alien race with testicles hanging under their chin. This is relevant because J punches them to knock an alien out after K reminds him that he is a "Ballchinian." Yes, you read right. Ball&#8230;chin&#8230;ian.

At the end of the movie, during his typical tie-in rap number (are we sure "Ali" didn't have some rap number called "Sting Like a Be (Do Tha Ali)" playing over the closing credits?), Smith ask the audience to "nod your head." I suppose I was half-obeying. I opted to shake my head in complete disgust.

Headline: "Nine Queens" cons crowds
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
Drag queens were the first thing that came to my mind when I heard about the Argentinean film "Nueve Reinas," "Nine Queens." Gee, was I mistaken. This is a film about con men and thieves, especially two men, Marcos (Ricardo Darien) and Juan (Gaston Pauls), who team up to deliver one of those movies that simply deserves awards. They meet in a gas station where Juan is pulling a scam and gets caught by the cashier. Marcos, a con himself, happens to be there at that time, and pretends to be a cop. Dragging him out of the convenience store as if to take him to the police station, it turns out that Marcos is taking pity on this young, inexperienced con. There's something about Juan's style that Marcos likes and does not have himself: a sincere face that allows people to trust him. So Marcos asks Juan to partner up with him. Juan agrees to this partnership for just one day. And so the film begins.

From the very beginning, I felt like I was sitting through a Quentin Tarantino film. While Marcos and Juan are busy conning different people here and there, a one in a million offer comes their way that they cannot afford to overlook: They are offered to sell a forged but believable version of the Nine Queens, a set of nine valuable and rare German Weimar Republic stamps, to a wealthy Spanish businessman. Although not apposite for forensic testing, the forged stamps not only look genuine, but they smell authentic as well. Coincidentally, the deal must be done today, for the businessman is about to be deported from Argentina tomorrow. In other words, there is no time to have them properly checked in a lab. Once every party agrees to this ultimate scam, the film takes the audience through many more loops. One minute we trust one character and the next minute we are not so sure. Each participant in the deal seems to be scamming everyone else involved and soon enough, it seems as though everyone in Buenos Aires is involved in the scam. 

In the end, we are in for a big surprise, one where writer-director Fabian Bielinski utilizes his talent to make twists and turns throughout the entire film, leaving the audience gasping in anticipation. As the film progresses, we know that there is an element of suspicion because not only are there too many coincidences, but both con artists are continuously doubting the other's honesty, forcing the audience to doubt it as well. This is what sets a distrustful tone; one in which we have no idea where Bielinski is leading us, only we try to figure it out before the end of the movie. 

Although Juan is a thief, we can't help but to feel sorry for him. Maybe it's because he has a conscience behind his sweet demeanor. After all, he is involved temporarily in this business only until he can steal enough money to bail his father out of prison as opposed to Marcos, who is an accomplice con artist simply for his own financial satisfaction. Marcos begins to realize that he doesn't have any of the needed characteristics for this business that Juan possesses. Thus, their characters are intended to complement each other nicely. 

However, I am not so impressed by their acting. In fact, I think that their performances are insipid and the chemistry between them not entirely believable. The actress who is of real interest is Marcos' sister, Valeria (Leticia Bredice), a tough corporate woman who loathes her brother and his work. Her rigid guise adds flavor to the film, but I think this is so because it is rare to find a female protagonist in any film who is as unyielding as she is. I am used to seeing the typical annoying actress playing the emotional female who ends up crying though her entire performance. Valeria's character is the complete opposite, and it is a thrilling change. 

The end of the film is completely stunning. It took me a few minutes to understand what was going on, but as soon as I did, I realized that it is brilliant the way in which Bielinski brings these characters together. 

Bielinski could have cut some of the unnecessary parts prior to the evolution of the major scam of the Nine Queens. But even with its flaws, this is an interesting flick for two reasons: You don't know what to believe until the very end of the movie, and also, it's fascinating to see the inner workings of the con world.

Headline: "Reign of Fire" burns down too quickly
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
We've all heard stories about dragons. Some say they were savage monsters of black magic that ate princesses and destroyed entire kingdoms. Others say they were noble creatures that brought good luck and were frequently misunderstood. But, as far as I know, "Reign of Fire" is the first story I've heard of them being described as an actual species. 

In this particular story, director Rob Bowman tells a tale of dragons and dragon slayers in a post-apocalyptic near future. "Reign of Fire" is loaded with so much action and suspense that it would make Mad Max envious and King Arthur pee in his pants. It also has a great plot, but it moves too quickly. Once you get a handle on where you are in the story, it immediately jumps to the next part. 

The story takes place a few years from now in England – naturally, that's where all the great dragon stories take place. A young boy named Quinn Abercromby makes his way to a construction site and down into a mine.

 While down there, he comes across an unusual cavern: it has a big scary fire-breathing monster in it. He manages to get away, but so does it. It flies away, reproduces and within a year there are a million of them wreaking havoc all over the world. 

Now comes one of the most disappointing parts of the film. Somebody is both narrating and writing in a journal, chronicling the next few years. He talks of how dragons are a species that hibernate for centuries, awaking only to burn the world and feed on it, killing off the dinosaurs and plaguing mankind throughout history, how nations used nuclear weapons to stop them and screwed up the world anyway. During this they show old video footage and medieval pictures of dragons to create the illusion of time passing. The illusion was pathetic. I expected to see something like dragons setting fire to the Royal Palace or destroying New York, "Independence Day" style. Instead, they give us a two or three-minute video anybody could have put together.

Then we flash-forward about a dozen or so years to the year 2020. Civilization as we know it has been burnt to a crisp and the world has been plunged into a new Dark Age. In England, a few remaining humans band together in a makeshift castle, and Quinn, the young boy turned young man (Christian Bale), is their leader. All is not well in his kingdom. The people are starving because they can't go out for food as much as they need to because the local dragon will cut them down. 

Even though Quinn is a good leader, it gets harder for him everyday. Then, one dismal morning, a band of brave knights rode up to the front gates on their noble steeds. Actually, they were a couple hundred men and women of the Kentucky infantry riding jeeps, trucks, tanks, and even a helicopter. They claim to be "dragon slayers" and that they can help the people. Well, this settles it; no matter who the enemy is, America will always have to bail out England in a fight. 

The leader of these brave knights is Denton Van Zan, played by a surprisingly rugged and bald Mathew McConaughey, who asks for shelter in the castle. Quinn reluctantly agrees. Tensions build up between the two, especially after the dragon slayer tries to recruit Quinn's people to go off on a dangerous mission to kill dragons, but they eventually see each other as allies. 

Of course, what would a story about knights and dragons be without a little romance? Specifically, between Quinn and Van Zan's helicopter pilot the lovely and deadly Alex (Izabella Scorupco, from "Vertical Limit"). In fact, that's just what it is: a little romance. They stare into each other's eyes a few times, but it doesn't go much further than that.

I have to commend "Reign of Fire" for its original plot as well as its many well-done action scenes, incredible special effects, and great performance of the cast. Mathew McConaughey never really struck me as the Mad Max type until now. However, the story moves at breakneck speed and is finished just as you start to enjoy it. Also, too many people get killed too fast and too early. I'm surprised there was anybody left by the end of the movie.
