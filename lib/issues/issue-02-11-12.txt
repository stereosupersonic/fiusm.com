Headline: Police arrest campus bag thief
Author: Ron Licona
&nbsp;
A suspect was arrested in connection with four bag thefts at both of FIU's campuses. Brian Thomas was taken into custody on Oct. 28 at approximately 11 a.m. and charged with grand theft and fraudulent use of stolen credit cards. He is currently under suspicion for multiple thefts across Miami-Dade county's universities, arresting officer Sgt. Ricardo Torres said.  

On Oct. 16 at 12:05 p.m., a bookbag was reported stolen from the Graham Center. 	According to police reports, the victim "had left his bookbag unattended for five minutes, and when he turned around someone had stolen his book bag with a cell phone, wallet, credit cards and other assorted items."

At 1:32 p.m., audio speakers were purchased with a stolen credit card at a Bose Audio Systems in Massachusetts for $1,060.85. An employee of the company became suspicious when he  "noticed that the buyer's address and phone number did not match the bank records," the report said. He "also became suspicious when such a large order was requested to be shipped overnight." 

The company did not send the merchandise and put the order on hold, pending investigation.

Torres checked out the address where the items would have been shipped and discovered it was a house in Opa-locka that had been vacant for two months. 

Neighbors said Thomas had resided at that address two months prior to the theft, the report said. 

Thomas' family members were questioned and a criminal background check led to information about his whereabouts and an extensive criminal record, including multiple arrests, Torres said.

Thomas was found at 152 N.W. 23 Street. Torres placed him under arrest and Thomas confessed to crimes at FIU: three thefts at BBC – including one in the library on Sept. 3 and one in the Wolfe University Center on Oct. 15 and two at UP. 

Thomas confessed that he "carried a bookbag and placed it next to the victim's bag and then proceeded to pick up the victim's bag and leave with it." 

He is currently under suspicion for multiple cases of bookbag thefts across Miami-Dade's universities, Torres said.

Headline: Controversy follows scientology exhibit to BBC
Author: Alejandra Diza
&nbsp;
Tall wood panels hold framed photographs of L. Ron Hubbard, creating a week of controversy at FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus.  The freestanding panels outlined with bright lights accent Hubbard's life achievements as part of an Images of a Lifetime display in Panther Square.  

"The exhibit is to give students awareness and to show what [Hubbard's] philosophy is about," L. Ron Hubbard Foundation Representative Sharyn Runyon said.  "We are not trying to sell you religion, just awareness."

Based on the tour guide's presentation, students felt the exhibit to be proselytizing the religious statutes of scientology.

"It's conceived that they are trying to sell you scientology," Jessica Perez, junior, public relations, said.

Some students enjoyed the display. "I think it's very interesting and I think it's good for them to be here," Korinne Dannon, freshman, journalism, said.  "It's informative and interesting to the students because this was a man who, from his childhood, affected the world."

Other students expressed concerns about Hubbard's ideas. "Exhibits like that shouldn't be at school because it's not [about] the humanitarian education; it's about church," Marina Kays, freshman, public relations, said. 

"It's superfluous and has nothing to do with our education; it shouldn't be allowed to be on campus." 

Some professors also disagreed with the exhibit's presence.  "I'm very suspicious of their motives; it's a religious organization," adjunct professor Peter Steadman said.  "Other professors are questioning its presence and wonder if they took advantage of the ignorance on the administrator's part."

Members of the L. Ron Hubbard Foundation said that scientology is not the focus of the exhibit.

Although Greg Olson, WUC director, was not available for comment at press time, Jennifer Cooper, associate director of operations and event planning, felt that the exhibit was beneficial to the students and faculty. 

"It would impart information to the students and faculty about what this gentleman was about," she said.

According to Hubbard's profile, "Scientology is an applied religious philosophy based on getting to know oneself as a spiritual and immortal being."

Headline: BBC students celebrate cultural diversity
Subheadline: Forum sparks concerns about differences between campuses
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
South Florida is a melting pot of cultures where traditional American customs take a back door to the exotic tastes and wonders of Caribbean and South American nations.

Celebrating this diversity was the order of the day at FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus Wednesday as students participated in roundtable discussions and attended lectures.

"I think diversity is fun," said Claudio Jimenez, an international student from Spain. "How boring would it be if everyone did the same thing?"

Jimenez was one of about 70 other students who attended a roundtable discussion at the Wolfe University Center Ballrooms that afternoon.

Students were split up into groups of five or six and were able to share their experiences about living in a diverse area.

"This is all about how persons identify themselves," said Valerie Taylor, the executive director of Many Voices: One Community. "Some say 'I'm second generation Colombian,' others say they're 'just American,' even though they weren't born here."

After students introduced themselves, they discussed some of the questions posed by Peer Educators Advocating Cultural Enrichment, a student group trying to maintain a multicultural environment at the university.

Questions ranged from racism to racial profiling to disparity between the university's campuses.

"[The questions helped students] think about [themselves] and the larger community," Taylor said. "The goal is to build community. You don't have to agree...just respect someone else's point of view."

For Nan Murray, 20, living in South Florida has helped open her mind to Hispanic culture.

"I've lived in South Florida and there's writing on the wall in Spanish," she said. "I get lost, but someone always helps me out. Now I want to learn Spanish."

Living in a city where different cultures always interact has helped Murray gain a better cultural appreciation than a book could have given her.

"To write down something on Hinduism and read that a cow is sacred is fine," Murray said. "But when I see the person's reactions, I'm more willing to accept it than to ridicule it. You embrace it because you can see it."

While living in Jamaica, Murray gained exposure to the many different cultures that call the island nation home.

"You become a lot more culturally sensitive," she said. "You get to celebrate with them instead of wondering what's going on."

The norm is for most people to segregate themselves, Dr. Dawn Addy, program director for the university's Center for Labor and Research Studies, said.

"One group celebrates [their culture for a month] but another looks interested and doesn't really engage," Addy, who helped facilitate the roundtable discussion, said. "This discussion calls more attention to the issues of diversity in a positive way."

However, hospitality management major Attila Gombos, 28, was insulted at the fifth discussion topic: whether international students make an effort to belong at the university.

"This is absolutely nonsense," said Gombos, a native of Hungary. "It's really up to you if you live in a country and want to adopt its customs."

Gombos, who has called five different countries home – Hungary, Austria, the United States, the Cayman Islands and the Dominican Republic – has  tried to immerse himself in their cultures.

"Wherever I lived, I tried to learn the languages and understand the people," he said. "FIU students should integrate themselves in the community."

Faculty members who attended the dialogue tackled the issue of racially profiling people of Middle Eastern descent.

"There is a need to stop terror," said Stephen Neal, a master of ceremonies at the symposium. "But the ends don't justify the means…You can't judge a book by its cover."

While thinking back to the Japanese internment camps of World War II and the months-old incident involving medical students of Middle Eastern descent in Florida, Neal's group felt profiling is a product of stereotyping and it should not continue.

But the issue that provoked the most emotion from students at the discussion was not based on racial backgrounds or cultures; it had to do with the disparity between University Park and BBC.

"The library at UP has many more resources. They have a hair salon and more food choices," said 23-year-old Tamara Williams, a travel and tourism major. "Every time they get a new building at UP, they paint one of our old buildings."

Famara Demba, 24, hotel management, agreed. "It's like calling Cuba part of the United States," he said, "They have three soccer fields at UP. There's only one here and it's not even maintained."

Williams was quick to offer a solution to these problems. "Most of the student fees go to UP, but the fees should go to where it's needed," she said.

Headline: Columnist overcomes depression
Author: Angela Castillo, Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
A week ago, I read an article in Time magazine about why the young commit suicide, and I recalled my own experience – as close as it was – with suicide. I hope my story will help someone to see that there is always light at the end of the tunnel.

 A couple of years ago, I did not care about myself. I wanted to make somebody else happy and that person became my whole world. He was my reason to smile, even in the bad moments. I had his face in my mind constantly. I became so attached to him that I felt unsafe whenever he was not holding my hands. I lost myself in that relationship. 

Now I admit I was too dependent on him, but I did love him. When he betrayed me by disclosing the intimate details of our relationship and talking about me behind my back to my best friend, it was a slap in the face.  It hurt so badly that sometimes I feel I'm still recovering. 

And I guess that's how I was pushed into a maze through which I struggled for a long time before I found a way out. 

I wanted to forget the "love of my life" so I started dating another guy. Unfortunately, he had only indifference for me. He would never bother calling me, and even though I knew he was taking me for granted, I kept going after him.  

His lack of interest made me think that I was neither physically nor spiritually attractive enough. For this reason, day by day, I started worrying a lot about my weight and about trying to find ways to be more affectionate, but nothing changed. I felt used and thus I became anorexic. 

"Every time my family makes comments about me and my health, I feel like I want to run to the bathroom and throw up until I die. Every time they try to have a 'friendly' conversation with me, I get furious, and I wish they would disappear forever." 

"Every time they try to cheer me up by taking me out to dinner or the movie theater, I make up a headache excuse, so I can stay home and sleep as long as I can. I'm so tired, I feel weaker than ever." This is not an excerpt from my diary (I burned it long time ago), but from an old notebook I still keep. 

My parents and my aunt, whom I was living with in Miami at the time, decided to send me back to my hometown in Peru because they thought the change of scenery would help me to get better. I did not even have time to say good-bye to any of my friends. My aunt gave me a speech about self-esteem and practically dragged me to the airport. 

Once I was home, I could not even look my mom in the eyes. I did not say a word to her. I would only leave my room to go to the bathroom or the kitchen. My mom knew things were wrong and she ended up reading my diary the one time I actually went out. 

I found out by myself what she had done by the way that she looked at me. It was a look of fear, sorrow and anger. I could not stand it, so I finally asked her for an explanation. 

I thought I was going to faint when she admitted her "crime." I wanted to hate her, but I couldn't.  I panicked and I felt the need to run, but she hugged me tight as she used to do when I was little just to make me feel safe. And for a moment I did. 

She accepted me and provided me with a non-judgmental venue to express my feelings.  

Thanks to her support and that of others, I was eventually able to conquer my depression and anorexia.

Unfortunately, thousands of young adults each year undergo similar experiences, and many of them do not have stories with happy endings.

Between 1950 and 1990, the incidence of suicide among young people has nearly tripled. In 1998, about 4,586 persons under the age of 24 took their own lives. Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in America and the third leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults.  
One in 10 college students have considered suicide as a "peaceful" way out of their lives because of the pressure they have at work, school and home. 

The lack of control makes them think they won't be able to overcome problems in the future, and their self-esteem is lowered. Heavy drinking and smoking serve as a temporary pain relief for many of them. 

Suicidal thoughts are a sign of severe and untreated depression. Depression is a killer. It kills you silently. It is not only a common mood disorder that attacks your body and mind, but it's like being trapped in a maze where the most disgusting feelings and thoughts live. 

If you think you get "the blues" too often, consider talking to someone you trust and love. You've got to talk, that's the starting point. That person may not have all the answers, but he or she can help you to find the real way out.

Headline: Letter To The Editor
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the Editor:


When my column, "Israeli claim to land unfounded" was horribly botched by your editorial staff, I brought the matter up to you – I'm sure you remember – and informed you that I would be submitting a letter to the editor outlining the editing mistakes and misconducts done by your staff. 


At your plea that a letter to the editor on the subject would "make us look bad," I proposed not writing a letter on the terms that you print a correction. You conceded. 


On Monday Oct. 21, the night before the paper went to print, you apparently changed your mind and requested that I instead resubmit a "more concise version" of the column for the paper to run in a future issue.


I will not resubmit my column because as far as making the paper – not to mention myself – "look bad" goes, this is probably the pinnacle. 


By not printing a correction, you and the paper you represent, stand by and support the fashion in which the column was edited. I disagree and feel I must inform the reader why.


Firstly, I must point out that, even though the column was turned in on time, the [former] opinion editor failed to return the column to me for rewriting or notify me that it would need to be edited. In short, she did not seek any kind of collaboration with me in hopes of creating a better column. 


Secondly, although I did not hear this from either the [former] opinion editor or yourself, several parties working at The Beacon told me that the letter was edited because it was too long. However, I was never informed of The Beacon's new policy on the length of columns. 


I say new because when I was editor of the opinion section, a job that I held for over two years, columns of the same length were not edited based on that criterion. I should also like to add that if this is in fact new official policy of The Beacon, it is quite a ridiculous one and I ask you to look at a new broadsheet newspaper, collegiate or commercial, and count the words in their columns. It's just simply impossible to write about complicated topics in 500 words.


But back to the column itself. In the first paragraph of the original column, where my main concern lies, the motives of Mr. Elli Wohlgelernter for speaking in American universities are questioned. 


I quoted from one of his articles in the Jerusalem Post to show that he was in fact biased towards the Israeli cause. The only quote that was left in the edited version was "anti-Israel activity" with no attribution to where it's from. 


I mention in the first paragraph that "I had no illusions of [the symposium] being an unbiased presentation of the situation in the Middle East." And then go on to explain that I reached that conclusion from reading Wohlgelernter's work in the Jerusalem Post. This was cut out of the final version. 


The edited column provides this explanation instead: "I assumed it would be an attempt by pro-Israeli organizations to turn the tide of 'anti-Israel activity' in American universities." This is completely false. I didn't assume anything.


Later on, when I tried to create a contrast between Wohlgelernter's claims of European anti-Semitism and anti-Semites key role in Zionism, the column was again mangled leaving only a chronologically disorganized, insipid, simple-minded, and even offensive explanation of the Zionist movement.


These are the two most evident examples of poor editing; although there are others that I will not point out because I believe the error in your staff's ways has been proven. 


I would like to end this letter with something I told you after my initial complaint: I write this letter with the same good faith that I write every one of my columns. I'd like to make clear that I'm not trying to belittle or attack anyone personally rather just to point out this inconsistence of efficiency, lack of attention to quality and journalistic integrity in the editing process with the hope that it doesn't happen again.


Andy Diaz
Senior, English

Editor's Note: The editorial board stands by the changes and policies regarding the publishing of Mr. Diaz's column. We feel the editing was fair and did not alter the overall message of the column.

Headline: In our view: Interest groups have right to promote views on campus
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Throughout last week, the  L. Ron Hubbard Foundation presented Images of a Lifetime, a tribute to Hubbard, at the Biscayne Bay Campus.  

While the Hubbard Foundation's presentation created controversy among faculty and students who felt the group was promoting the teachings of Scientology, – a religion which Hubbard founded – the group ultimately has the right to  display on campus.

At the same time at University Park, accounting major Jorge Pinedo was presenting his "I agree with Jorge" campaign to advocate his views on christianity, culminating with a presentation in GC 150. Again, some students expressed concern about the propriety of religious groups promoting their views on campus. 

While these displays might have made some students uncomfortable, it is antithetical for a university and its student body to repress the expression of varying points of view, no matter how controversial.

A university should foster an open dialogue of different ideas that emphasize and encourage opinions as diverse as its community.

We at The Beacon support this practice because we provide a forum for students to voice their opinion on a weekly basis.

LOSER
Brian Thomas: Stealing from college students?  That's like stealing from the poor.  We are already in debt from buying those textbooks. Now we have to ruin our credit even more by taking out another student loan to replace them.

Headline: Musician sets aside lifelong dream to pursue education
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Whenever I bring a new friend home, I'm doomed to utter embarrassment. My loving parents always bust out the infamous baby album filled with photos of my mostly nude infancy and early childhood. As mortifying as this ritual is, there's one picture in particular I never grow tired of. It's a photograph of myself as a newborn lying beside my father's trumpet, which, at the time, equaled me in length. 

It's the same trumpet that was passed down to me and ultimately introduced me to the world of music that has been a presence in my father's family for over three generations.

The life of a jazz musician isn't necessarily an easy one. The genre has almost been forgotten, especially in the South Florida scene, with only a few dwindling and mostly pathetic spurts of interest or popularity. My father struggled for several years during his early career, playing any and every gig he could find. 

The possibility of quitting the business and seeking another calling grew, as did the bills and debts, but even when he finally landed a steady and well paying gig in the industry, it wasn't his beloved jazz music.

Knowing all this and experiencing it through my father led me to an upsetting conclusion about the future of my musical knowledge, my career and my lifestyle. All the risks, the intense dedication, the hardships, the harsh competition and everything else one must take into account when considering the life of a musician convinced me to attend a university and pursue a degree in something more "practical" than music.

Now, music remains as a hobby, one that I find less and less time for, especially since college has recently turned up the notch on workload. I practice my trumpet every once in a while and occasionally jam with a few friends, but without time or real motivation like band classes or other music-related activities, my ability fades. 

It's a bit depressing to see my trumpet's case collect dust under my bed, and sometimes I feel a strange jealousy whenever I hear FIU's marching band rehearsal.

I've always thought it would be great to do something adventurous like join a band, drop out of school, tour the world and have the time of my life. I never thought seriously of this idea until the opportunity was actually presented to me. 

I recently spoke to the singer of a small, yet fairly well-known, Gainesville-based ska band and discovered that they are looking for a trumpet player. 

What a fork in the road this opportunity has created for me. Do I stay in school here in Miami and probably end up with a steady job somewhere down the line, or do I withdraw, sell all my stuff and move to Gainesville? (This of course assuming the audition goes well.) 

It's very intriguing for me to think what would happen to my life if I were to join the band. At the same time, however, it's frightening. As a musician in this band, I would most likely live out of a suitcase, playing show after show and trying to survive on the undoubtedly pitiful pay.

 Just like jazz, ska is a dying genre. The number of people who even know what ska means is few and its popularity in the underground music scene is overshadowed by the recent indie-rock fad. The fame of other ska bands such as Reel Big Fish or the Mighty Mighty Bosstones will never be replicated. 

Of course, it's not about the fame or the money, hell I'm a journalism major, but I'm not the type of person who can just totally disregard the future; How long will the band last? If I want to go back to school when the fun is over, how will I be able to afford it? 

These along with other questions weigh too heavily on my mind, so I have decided to tuck my little dream away and continue my studies at the university. 

I'll never stop calling myself a musician at heart, but I guess I just don't feel a strong enough love or passion for it to risk everything and try to make it as a professional. 

Maybe I'm turning down the chance of a lifetime and the most amazing experience ever, but I feel that my calling is where I am now. I trust myself enough to know that much about this situation. If for some reason that calling should ever change though, so will my decision.

Dear Mr Editor:

I am very excited about an idea I have for your paper.
First of all my full name is Camille Perkins
Year in school: Senior
Department: Arts & Sciences
Major: Psychology
Phone number: 305 348 9010


Now,here is my idea:
An love/relationship advice column called something like Dr.Perks' Love--I am thinking of something more creative.
But I am thinking the introduction of it can be with a sample of a relationship question and a sample of my answer--so that students reading it would send in their relationship question for next weeks paper.
So,it would be a weekly feature--(hoping that students would send in their questions regularly).
This is a rough draft of my idea. I am hoping that this is something we can pursue. Adding a love/relationship column would be very entertaining and ofcourse students would always be looking forward to the next issue of the Beacon Newspaper--wanting to see the answer to their question or just looking to see what reply someone else got.
Ofcourse, I am not a psychologist so it would be made clear that this is just for entertainment purposes.
So,tell me Mr Editor--what do you think of my idea?
Thanks
Camille

Headline: Haitian detainees and the aroma of discrimination
Subheadline:  
Author: qtlizzy81@yahoo.com
&nbsp;
In response to last week's edition of the newspaper, I will not hesitate to voice my opinion on the election matter. First, kudos to the GOPs and for our state: the election seemed to have gone smooth here in Florida. However, I am a democrat and I will not refrain from expressing my disappointment in Bush being re-elected and the Republicans gaining control of Congress; this is especially due to the fact that I am Haitian-American. It is, and has been for a very long time apparent that Haitians seeking political asylum by risking their lives and coming to this country by boat face tremendous animosity by government and federal officials. This seems to be even more noticeable when Republicans are, point blank "in session" -- be it the state having a republican governor, the country being led by a GOP and/or when Congress is dominated by this party affiliation. It is unnerving that the media, because of these particular politicians, associate danger and terrorism with Haitians – all of a sudden there is a need to protect the United States' coastal borders. Yet what is even more appalling in this ordeal is the large number of Haitian citizens living in South Florida doing little to help their brothers and sisters. 
The protests, which seem to be situated only in North Miami, are not enough. The Haitian community does not only include those living in Little Haiti and the North Miami area; Kendall, Miramar, Ft. Lauderdale, Cutler Ridge, and especially West Kendall are plentiful with this group. Marlen Bastien seems to be the only person making rounds to Krome Detention center in order to help the detained individuals. I am certain that there are other people lending a hand in this matter, but they need to come out to the forefront! State Representative Philip Brutus, newly elected State Representative Yolly Robinson and North Miami mayor Joe Celestin have to fight for the people who put them in office. Ms. Robinson was described in the Miami Herald as being media shy. In my opinion, if she suffers from this "syndrome", then she should have never run for office. Celestin's political affiliation is also  upsetting. However, I will not dive into this particular subject. To me, I feel that he definitely sold out the Haitian community since he is not lifting one finger to help with this situation. 
When I came home and turned on my TV to find NBC6 reporting on the 200 Haitians jumping into the bay, I immediately logged on the internet to contact the Haitian Student Union here at FIU. This is not the first time I have contacted them with no response back. Even more troubling, I could not find their homepage through the school's site. That is a shame. The organization is based in the Biscayne Bay campus, which makes me wonder the reason behind this. I mean, FIU has two campuses right? The time has come for us as a people to unite and help one another. One person's voice alone cannot do this (in reference to Ms. Bastien). Just as the Cuban community united together to demonstrate their upset over Elian's 5am raid two and a half years ago is the same way we need to show our outrage in the treatment of our people. If this means going on strike at work, protesting in the streets (and highways!) of South Florida, and writing to Haitian-American politicians to get the message heard, then this is all worth it. We should never forget our roots: this could have been us in that boat and at Krome. We would want as many people possible fighting for our rights.

If this means going on strike at work, protesting in the streets (and highways!) of South Florida, and writing to Haitian-American politicians to get the message heard, then this is all worth it. We should never forget our roots: this could have been us in that boat and at Krome. We would want as many people possible fighting for our rights.

Headline: Marijuana's safety
Subheadline:  
Author: seishin17@yahoo.com
&nbsp;
My name is Kristopha Hohn, a third-year Anthropology student, and I subscribe to discovery.com's newsletter. In it there was an article about how marijuana is more dangerous for the lungs than normal tabacco. I thought it might be a nice addition to an issue of The Beacon since I'd like to believe that a number smoke it, as even said in the article, because they believe it is safer than smoking cigarettes. Of course, this is ultimately up to your scrutiny, but I have included the article. Thank you very much. I can be reached at 305-348-9363.


Cannabis More Harmful to Lungs Than Tobacco
AFP

Nov. 11 — Cannabis is more dangerous than tobacco and smoking three joints of pure cannabis is as bad for the lungs as 20 cigarettes, a medical study by the British Lung Foundation said Monday. 

When the cannabis is mixed with tobacco, the effects are even worse, said the study titled "A Smoking Gun." 

The tar in cannabis contains 50 percent more carcinogens than tobacco. 

The study showed that the dangers linked to smoking cannabis are higher today than in the 1960s, as the cannabis is 15 times stronger than it was then with an ever growing level of THC (tetrahydrocanabinol), the main active ingredient. 
This means, the report says, that studies carried out in the 60s are no longer applicable. 

Dr Mark Britton, chairman of the foundation, said: "These statistics will come as a surprise to many people, especially those who choose to smoke cannabis rather than tobacco in the belief it is 'safer' for them. 

"It is vital that people are fully aware of the dangers so they can make an educated decision and know the damage they may be causing. The report is not about the moral rights and wrongs of cannabis, but simply making sure everyone is completely clear about the respiratory health risks involved." 

Dame Helena Shovelton, chief executive of the foundation, said: "Puff and inhalation volume with cannabis is up to four times higher than with tobacco — in other words you inhale deeper and hold your breath with the smoke for longer before exhaling. This results in more poisonous carbon monoxide and tar entering into the lungs."

Headline: New Certification for MBAs
Subheadline:  
Author: rbunnell@quixotegroup.com
&nbsp;
Dear Editor,

The International Certification Institute (ICI) recently announced the Certified MBA (CMBA) - the first and only certification program developed to enhance MBA marketability and hiring decisions. The exam has generated a great deal of interest. Because Florida International enrolls a significant number of MBA students (nearly 1,000 students), I would like to address some of the questions they may have.

The test measures the core curriculum portion of MBA Programs, consistent with the AACSB-specified content for accreditation.  Because of this focus, the exam can be applied universally, regardless of a student's MBA program or area of specialty. The test is not intended to predict business success, leadership or other intangible qualities - factors that we agree would be difficult to measure with a standardized test.  It will also not be used in any way to rank programs. Because of the voluntary nature of the exam, ranking schools based on test results would not be statistically relevant.  

The CMBA designation is a tool for MBAs and businesses to use as a means of differentiation, regardless of the program granting an individual's degree.  Certification verifies knowledge of the fundamentals, allowing recruiters to focus on a candidate's intangible qualities. 

We are available to any member of your institution to answer questions or offer additional clarification about the exam.  I also invite your MBA students to apply for the CMBA 'beta' exam - a chance to earn the designation of CMBA at no cost between now and January 31.

Thank you,
W. Michael Mebane
Managing Director, International Certification Institute

Headline: RE: How safe do you feel on campus
Subheadline:  
Author: rinsi25@aol.com
&nbsp;
 "Police arrested campus bag thief!"  Wow, what a headline! Although I should be happy about this headline, I don't really feel as safe as I should.  Yes, I must say that this should be a great load off of our shoulders as students, but why isn't it?  How safe are we really on campus?
  A friend of mine was a victim of a flasher in one of the bathrooms of the DM building on South Campus, and I must add that I was very upset to find out that nothing could be done to find the "flashing culprit".  Did you know that the cameras in certain buildings only serve as decoys?  Hello! Does anyone out there think that perhaps some of the money from the increase in our tuition could go into investing in our safety?  The results of the recent poll in The Beacon regarding how safe we feel on campus, pretty much sums it up!  "Safe…are you kidding? Have you seen this place at night?  Did they forget to pay FPL?"  Some students spend a great deal of time on campus, the least we could feel is safe!  So, either we avoid the bathrooms in the DM building, or we do something about it!  Oh, and by the way as for the sick flasher, get a life, and watch out you might loose something while your flashing!

Headline: Men's basketball suspends Johnson indefinitely
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Golden Panther forward Taurance Johnson has been suspended by head coach Donnie Marsh for the remainder of the fall semester. Marsh is hoping the time off will help Johnson improve his grades. 

"I want to stress that Taurance is academically eligible to participate at this time," Marsh said. "In order to better assist him, I thought it was important to help him re-focus on what it takes to be a good college student."

Johnson, a native of Williamsport, PA, led FIU last season in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots  as a freshman. 

The 6-9, 230 pound sophomore was one of the top prep players in the nation coming out of Philadelphia Christian High School.  He was listed as the 39th best player on Oettinger's "Top 100 Rising Seniors." 

Johnson average 14.7 points, 6.2 rebounds and 55 blocks and was second on the team in steals with a 1.8 per game average.

&nbsp;
The first half couldn't have gone worse for the Golden Panthers. FIU trailed at intermission 20-0 to visiting Albany. That was when FIU head coach Don Strock had some choice words for his team in the locker room. 

"I'm no Vince Lombardi," Strock said. "At halftime I told them very nicely to start executing plays."

FIU responded with four touchdowns, three were thrown by freshman quarterback Jamie Burke in the second half. The scores came in a 13-minute span. The scores came from four different FIU players.

Greg Moss returned a Great Dane punt to the FIU 32-yard line after the defense stopped Albany on its first possession of the second half. Burke then found Everett Mitchell for a 29-yard touchdown to open up the scoring for FIU.

An interception by Gerrod Bodie on the second offensive series for Albany set the stage for a 35-yard touchdown run by Jerrid Lundstedt. Lundstedt was starting in place of injured starter Rashod Smith. The Homestead native finished the afternoon with 112 yards on 18 carries, making him only the second FIU player to rush for over 100 yards in a contest. Smith accomplished this feat twice before. "Our player of the game without question was Jerrid. He came and played a tremendous game for us," Strock said.

An acrobatic dive into the end zone by Harold Leath after a short pass from Burke gave the Golden Panthers a 21-20 lead with 7:13 to play in the third period. The play went for 14 yards.

Leath finished with six catches for 60 yards while Cory McKinney also caught six passes for 103 yards.

FIU's defense changed from a 4-man to a 5-man defensive front in the second half. The alteration seemed to puzzle the Great Danes. "That change was a big difference," safety Nick Turnbull said. "It forced their offensive line to stay with our defensive line. In the first half, we weren't getting those opportunities until they had already run for five or six yards."

After a fumble by Albany's Ryan McClay, Burke connected with Julius Eppinger for a 19-yard touchdown. Ironically, it was McClay who was beat while trying to cover Eppinger in the secondary.

Burke then found McKinney for a 16-yard touchdown with 10:09 to play in the contest. The play proved to be the final scoring drive Burke would orchestrate before leaving the game with a sprained wrist. Burke, who finished 17 of 30 for 243 yards with four touchdowns and one interception, said the injury isn't serious and he should be ready to play in the season finale against Florida Atlantic on Nov. 23.

Backup David Tabor came into the game midway through the second quarter and provided some confidence in the offensive unit. Tabor completed 4 of 8 passes for 62 yards but was unable to lead FIU to a score. 

"My head wasn't in the game in the first half," Burke said. "When I got pulled and saw the way David [Tabor] was able to move the team, I wanted to get back in. When we came back out I was on my game."

"FIU is too good of a football team to let back into the game," Albany head coach Bob Ford said. "We needed to come out in the third quarter and turn the screws on them. We failed to do it and the game got away from us."

The Great Danes, the fifth non-scholarship opponent FIU has beaten this season, came into the contest as the sixth-best rushing team in I-AA with a 257.9 yard average. The team was held to 227 yards, the majority of which came from Gary Jones, who tallied 124 yards on 18 carries with two touchdowns for Albany.

Turnbull led the FIU defense with 10 tackles, including six solo tackles. Lance Preston also had 10 stops. T.J. Singletary forced a fumble that led to a touchdown in the third quarter.

Kicker Adam Moss was perfect on all five extra point attempts.

"I think alot of this was about us being young," Strock said. "At halftime, we were looking around the locker room for leaders. All we had were redshirt freshmen." 

"To come back the way we did was very pleasing. But if  our guys keep this up I'm going to have a heart attack."

Up next for FIU

The Golden Panthers will visit the Owls of Florida Atlantic University (1-8) at Pro Player Stadium. The contest, which is set for kickoff at 3:00 p.m., will be the first of an annual showdown between the two schools.
FAU last defeated Morris Brown 34-13 at the school's 2002 homecoming game. The Owls were led by running back Daveon Barron who carried the ball 25 times for 147 yards.  

The Owls and FIU both faced Bethune-Cookman this season. FAU fell 30-17 while FIU was shutout 31-0. The Owls finished the 2001 season 4-6.

Headline: Women's soccer ends season with loss to South Alabama
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
The women's soccer team ended its season in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament with a 2-1 loss to host South Alabama Wednesday afternoon in Mobile, Ala.

The Jaguars got on the board early due to a goal from forward Julia Herman in the 12th minute. The goal was set up by a diving save by Adrienne McWilliams on an earlier attempt by Jaguar midfielder Rebecca Kahn, leaving the net open for the easy goal.

The Golden Panthers tied the score at the 25 minute mark on a goal from senior forward Ifeoma Dieke. The goal was set up by a long pass from senior midfielder Sarah Middlebrook. Dieke, a 2001 All-Sun Belt selection who was playing in her first game of the season, then beat the Jaguar defense off the dribble and knocked it home.

The game remained even until the closing moments of the first half. The Jaguars' intense pressure on the Golden Panthers' defense in the final minute paid off with a goal for Kahn. USA got off several shot attempts and finally caught McWilliams on the ground again for another simple chip shot with only six seconds left in the half.

The goal proved to be the difference in the match, as from that point on, both defenses clamped down and neither team was able to score a goal in the second half. 

South Alabama will face the winner of this evening's North Texas-Middle Tennessee match.

The return of Dieke for FIU was tempered somewhat by the continued absence of senior forward Nicola Bell. 

Bell, a 2002 All-Sun Belt first-teamer, did not play for the third consecutive game due to lingering effects from a concussion suffered against Arkansas State.

FIU ends the year 2-14-2.

Bell was named to the First-Team All-Sun Belt Conference on 
Wednesday.

UNO carried a 13-7 lead early in the third game. The Golden Panthers made a gradual comeback and raised the score to 15-13. The Privateers were winning by eight points until FIU allowed only a five point defeat at 30-25.  

FIU eventually boosted itself to 29-27 and guaranteed a 30-28 win in the ensuing set.

The final game opened and closed with Privateer success. Despite FIU's efforts to keep them down, the Privateers began with an 11-9 lead.

Headline: Men's soccer rolls over Mercer, 6-0
Author: Daisy Fernández/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After securing a bid into the NCAA Tournament last week, the men's soccer team (11-4-1) continued its success, by defeating the Bears of Mercer 6-0.  

Senior Matias Asorey, playing in his final home game, scored the first goal of the night. In the 22nd minute, he sprinted to catch a cross by John Pulido and scored for the Golden Panthers. 

Fifteen minutes later, Pulido scored an unassisted goal of his own. At 37:49, he moved past Mercer defenders and scored past Bear goalkeeper Jonathan Riley.

Forward Paul Kovolos made the greatest contribution to FIU's win. He scored twice within two minutes in the first half. In the 43rd minute, he came up with a steal and raced towards the goal, putting a shot past keeper Riley.

Less than two minutes later, he scored again. 

This time he was assisted by Billy Boswell and Lucas Scudeler, who passed him the ball from the left side of the penalty box. He was able to score and give FIU a 4-0 halftime advantage.

At the 57th minute, Oscar Gil scored another goal for the Golden Panthers. After scuffling past Mercer defense, he arrived before the keeper and made his sixth goal of the year. 

With less than a minute left in the game, freshman Jared Rose recorded his first goal at FIU. The midfielder played a long pass by goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg and scored FIU's sixth goal of the game.

FIU saw a new keeper protect the goal: Shawn Crowe. Although he remained unchallenged, he was part of the Golden Panther shutout.  Rosenberg managed four saves against Mercer.  

Three FIU seniors played their last games at University Park: forward Alvaro Aservi, Asorey and defender Juan Rivera. 

With this win, the Golden Panthers have increased its winning streak to 12. 

FIU raised its winning streak to 13 consecutive games after being UCF on Sunday afternoon. 

Asorey, Billy Boswell and Paul Kolovos each had a goal on Sunday as FIU defeated UCF 3-2 on the road. Asorey also had an assist in the game.
FIU next travels to South Carolina for a game Sunday.

WENDESDAY – Student Lobbing Director Hank Schramm discussed the negative effect of the two amendments passed in the Nov. 5 elections; Amendment 8 provided for a universal Pre-K program and Amendment 11 created a Board of Governors to oversee the state university system.  

Schramm pointed out that other states that installed similar Pre-K programs took funds from the state's university systems to help pay for these new programs. 

President Adrian Carter said he predicts tuition would increase by as much as 50 percent by fall 2003 to help offset the cost of the amendments. 

 Vice President Alexander Lewy said he is currently working with Food Director Art Sturnberg on the food evaluations being conducted. Lewy and Lower Division Representative Micah Mintz are working on getting a section of the cafeteria in accordance with Kosher requirements. Lewy said the University Park Campus dining services would also be installing a Kosher section to their food services.  

Three representatives were introduced to the council after being elected in the Oct. 29 special elections; Admatha Israel, Jesse Rodriguez and Micah Mintz. All three members were immediately placed in the vacant seats of the Finance Committee.  

The Council looked at Ameriplan, a discount dental benefits program that would benefit international students.

The program would offer dental programs for $12 per month for a single person. The plan would not be available for a few more months.

WEDNESDAY – Last week's meeting was held in the Graham Center Pit as a part of student government's Reach Out program and Campaign Days.

Students walking by stopped to listen and watch.

The idea behind the Campaign Days, Nov. 6 and 7, was "to touch and talk to as many people as possible," Vice President Omar Castillo said.
"One time a year we come out here to relate to the students directly," President Jessica Morffi said. 

Morffi discussed the outcome of Amendment 11. Morffi said the result was "not exactly what the university was looking towards."
SGC is in the process of getting campus security to place more emergency telephones. Currently, the majority of the call boxes are in parking lots. New call boxes may show up near University Apartments, Everglades Hall and around the Green Library. 

Three appropriations were passed last week, totaling $1,510.
Lower Division Rep Jacqui Sosa and reps at large Jorge Rosario, Clayton Solomon and Bill Wilson sponsored A02-15, in support of the Bachelor of Fine Arts color catalog.

"In the past, the catalogs have been printed in black and white colors, taking away the true meaning and form of a students work," the appropriation states.

Sosa explained the importance of upgrading the catalog withcolor.
"These are a showcase of the students' works," she said. The catalogs will carry SGC's logo seal. "It can help get them a good job."

The $950 appropriation covers the cost of upgrading to color.

The University Police Department is proposing "Operation Stop Auto Theft"and a "Blue Light Night Out" on a bill sponsored by Rosario, Sosa, Solomon and Wilson.

SGC is working with the UPD to instruct students about the use and location of all blue lights and emergency telephones. Five hundred dollars will be appropriated to the UPD to purchase antitheft devices.	

The plan encourages the two groups to work together to "further develop an efficient and effective approach to assist in combating auto thefts from the University."

Lastly, in support of a pool table for the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences, A02-17 was passed. The $60 would go to Andres Herrera for repayment. Herrera donated the pool table to the Engineering Student Council. The cost of the pool table was covered by Herrera because of an SGC time constraint, Rosario said. It became a "commitment made by the Finance Committee" to pay Herrera back for the table, he said.

"They needed more campus life over there," Rosario, who sponsored the appropriation with Wilson, said. "It will help make engineering students feel a little more at home in their campus."

Headline: "Bounce" falls flat
Author: Jay Santiago
&nbsp;
Few bands embodied the era of pop-metal like Bon Jovi. Almost none were as influential.  

Their self-titled debut album, released in 1984, brought instant success as their first single "Runaway" became a top 40 hit. Their next album, Slippery When Wet, went on to sell over nine million copies, most of its popularity coming from videos shown on MTV, creating what would become pop-metal/rock.  

Using the same formula, 1988's New Jersey shot to number one upon its release. The following year, Bon Jovi reunited to record a fifth album, Keeping the Faith, which was released in 1992. After appearing in some movies and TV shows, Jon Bon Jovi released his first official solo album in the summer of 1997. Three years later, Bon Jovi regrouped and released Crush.  

His latest release, Bounce, brings the band back to the limelight, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard charts immediately upon its release.  Bounce is a horrible cliché.  After watching Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band have great success, Bon Jovi's album is in essence a duplicate, that being an ode to Sept. 11.  Unfortunately, it comes off as a cheap exploitation for profit focusing on the terrorists acts that killed thousands in New York.  

The first track, "Undivided," uses heavy guitar play, telling people to be "united," calling everyone "brothers," "sisters," "fathers," and "mothers."  The first single, "Everyday," is finely tuned and crafted and includes an appealing hook.  The track's emotion feels forced, detracting from the images of despair and farewell. Strong rhythm from guitars and drums introduce "The Distance," which has a good beat ruined by Bon Jovi's atrocious vocals.  

The song has religious undertones, dealing with overused concepts of belief and transitions from dark to light. Taking a step back from being commercial, the track "Joey" is a good listen, incorporating soft beats with a mellow sound.  "Misunderstood" is anything but misunderstood, it's just plain bad, as no one with an ounce of sanity would want to comprehend what he was trying to do.  With vocals like this, Bon Jovi should get together with Ja Rule and make a ballad.  "All About Loving You," shows the ugly side of the '80s, the one that brought us some terrible rock songs. Now that I've passed the half-point of the CD, I must admit I find this unbearable.  "Love Me Back" is a song about resilience that does nothing for me, exhibiting weak emotion.  "Hook Me Up" is decent but sounds exactly the same as the rest of the CD.  Nothing really sets the tracks apart from each other. 

 Sadly, that was most likely the point. A blueprint was followed to ensure commercial success.   The entire album is radio-ready, friendly from start to finish.  The beats are nice, but the singing is awful.  How anyone can like this is beyond me.  If you're a fan, you'll probably pick this up anyway, but for the rest of you, you might want to "bounce" to another station or CD.

Headline: Murphy carries amusing remake of "I Spy"
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
I spy with my little eye another classic TV show turned into a movie. We can add "I Spy" to the small but growing list of others such as "Dragnet," "Lost in Space," "The Fugitive" and "Charlie's Angels." Like the others, this one was given a new and upbeat look. Now usually that technique doesn't work and in the end it feels as if there's something missing from the film, but there are a few rare exceptions where a new look makes it just as good or even better than the show. In her latest film, director Betty Thomas ("28 Days") somehow manages to beat the odds. Based on the 1965 hit series starring Robert Culp and Bill Cosby, "I Spy" is loaded with action and plenty of laughs, even though 90 percent of those come from Eddie Murphy.

When it comes to the spy business, special agent Alexander Scott (Owen Wilson) from the Bureau of National Security can be classified as mediocre, and that's on his really good days. He has a reputation for screwing up so bad, it's getting to the point where no one can trust him with a mission. Although he has adequate technical skills, speaks more than one language and his heart is in the right place, he lacks style and acts less like James Bond, more like Inspector Clouseau, which is why the higher-ups in the BNS are a bit reluctant to give him his new assignment. Arnold Gundars (Malcolm McDowell), a wealthy and powerful Eastern European arms dealer, has stolen a new $250 million stealth fighter jet. 

The jet is so advanced that it can become invisible to the naked eye, and he plans to auction it off to the highest bidder. Alex is to go undercover, infiltrate Gundars' estate in Budapest and then fly it back to Washington. But that's the easy part compared to who and what he's going undercover as.

In this corner, weighing in at about 500 pounds (300 of which make up his swelled head), the ultimate super heavyweight boxing champion of the wooooorld: Kelly Robinson (Eddie Murphy). Modesty is not something he is known for. Murphy plays Robinson as a guy who's so full of himself that he even refers to himself in the third person when he talks, and talk he does, at great lengths. After 57 straight knockouts he plans to go to Budapest to fight the European champion Cedric Mills (Darren Shahlavi), or as he refers to him, number 58. 

Here's where the plan comes together. On top of being a big time bad guy, Gundars is also a big time boxing fan. He invites Robinson and his crew to a major party at his home. The best way for Alex to get in is to pose as Robinson's assistant, but neither one of them is happy with the idea. 

Robinson doesn't care about Alex's rules and regulations and Alex can't stand working with such an egomaniac who doesn't respect his authority. In fact, the only thing that makes the mission worthwhile for Alex is the chance to work with Rachel Write (Famke Janssen) the best and hottest female agent in the business.

Although the other actors gave great performances, there is no question that this movie was all about Eddie. That man lives up to his reputation as both a great actor and a hilarious comedian in this movie. 

The only real problem about it is that it bears very little resemblance to the original '60s program. In the series, Robert Culp, the white guy, was Kelly Robinson and Bill Cosby was Alexander Scott. Also, both were competent BNS spies instead of a mediocre secret agent and an arrogant boxing champ. Still, I guess it does redeem Betty Thomas for giving us "The Brady Bunch Movie.'

Headline: "Odd Couple" examines need for friendship
Author: Alejandra Diaz
&nbsp;
Experience the hell of living with someone through "The Odd Couple."  The male and female version of the Broadway play written by Neil Simon is being performed in rotating repertory at the Biscayne Bay Campus.  The international cast debuted their first male performance on Nov. 7 while the female version opened on Nov. 8.

Director Stephen Neal described the play as "an unusual relationship between a right brain and a left brain person, but it's in the same gender." 

Set in present-day New York, "The Odd Couple" explores the idea of two long time friends with completely opposite personalities who get together as roommates, but end up driving each other crazy. 

Their clashing personalities add a comedic element to the play. "It puts a pair of people together that are not man and wife but who have the same characteristics," Neal said. Other characters that add to the comedy are the couple's poker friends who bring sarcasm and wit to an already humorous script. The addition of Russian neighbors gives the play a sense of diversity and leaves the audience with a feeling of acceptance. 

"The Odd Couple" touches on the importance of laughter and friendship during a difficult time of separation and divorce. When asked about the play's message, Neal stated: "This comedy leaves the audience with a good feeling about themselves and friendships. It's okay to be different, we don't all have to be perfect."

The male version's second night proved to be particularly interesting because the male lead was re-cast after only one night.  Since the male lead that played Felix had to leave the play because of circumstances beyond his control, Ivan Lopez was called in at the last minute.  

"It was a weird experience because I found out about it the night before the play, but the hardest part was having to make the audience believe that I didn't know what was going to happen next," Ivan Lopez said.

Delivering his lines with script in hand, Lopez was able to keep the energy of the play going while doing a remarkable job of keeping his place. After being asked about his reasons to do the play at the last minute, Lopez stated, "The love of theatre and the challenge motivated me to do it."  

The other actors as well as the director were impressed with Lopez's acting ability and showed their appreciation for his help. "We are glad that we were able to get him down here to do the play because it helped get the energy moving," Neal said.

"The Odd Couple" is a great chance to see Neal's outstanding cast bring their characters to life in an entertaining and amusing way. This is a good opportunity to support fellow students and see the Biscayne Bay Campus' theatre at it's best.  

Catch the next male version at 8 p.m. on Nov. 15 and on the 17th at 2 p.m.  The female version will play on Nov. 14 at 8 p.m. and Nov. 16 at 2 p.m.

Headline: "Tekken" lacks punch
Author: Mario M. Sarria
&nbsp;
The "Tekken" series has returned with modifications and additions in a mediocre attempt to perfect the "Tekken" formula and please fans of the series. "Tekken 4" is the culmination of a legacy from the 32-bit era when a rivalry between 3-D fighting franchises dominated the arcades and consoles, the major contenders at the time being Namco's "Tekken" and Sega's "Virtua Fighter." The game features the standard Namco modes such as Arcade, Practice, Time Attack, Team Battle, as well as an old favorite, Tekken Force.

A brand new Story mode offers character sketches with background information about the character, all with spoken dialogue, as well as fully-rendered movies. Also new is the training mode, which turned out to be a cheap extra. It's as if they gave up halfway through. 

One missing feature is a tag-team mode. The concept added so much dynamic functionality to the Tekken fighting system that most gamers will be left confused as to why Namco left it out. On the positive side, Tekken Force mode, which puts the character of your choice into an old style beat'em, is back.

Characters are very well modeled even though you rarely get to see them up close. Models range from very creative, (Heichach's sumo get up), while others are just boring (how many characters do you need just wearing jeans?) Also new to the Tekken series are stages with confined areas. Now you can be cornered up against a wall. Although it may seem like an open doorway to cheesy fighting strategy, Namco provides each character with moves to counter many of the characters' air juggle combos. It's a great addition because now those Tekken scrubs can't use the punch-kick-and-run strategy of the past. The only flaw is when your fighter gets pushed against a barrier they are temporarily stunned, leaving your character open to massive punishment through energy draining combos.

 It looks like Namco tried to even out the fighting system, but Tekken's fighting system wasn't balanced to begin with. Try fighting the incredible CPU that can pull off moves with split-second timing during your attacks. Not only do certain air juggles not work the same way they used to, damage has been significantly reduced. If the move list in the practice mode helps you out with a new juggle combination, the characters are still unbalanced. They can still pull off the same brute force strategies from past Tekken games and cause major damage, rendering new fighters useless in confined areas.

To add insult to injury, the new 8-way diagonal movement system brought over from Namco's superior "Soul Calibur" was done without any thought or consideration. Any move that once required the directional pad to be pressed diagonally now forces the character to circle your opponent in the specific direction, instead of the diagonal crouch/jump forward or backward.

"Tekken 4" features 18 distinct fighters, some of which are hidden. Namco blew it on Combot, a robot that is a cool-looking waste of time. Combot is basically like random select, an option the game already has. You don't know which fighting style the CPU will choose for Combot until you see his fighting stance on the first round. Why do such a thing when you can just have the CPU choose a character at random at the select screen? Completely pointless.  

While the mechanics in "Tekken 4" have been impaired, this is the first "Tekken" game to be developed from the ground up on Playstation 2 hardware. Thanks to the more experienced development team, "Tekken 4"'s character models are better designed than its predecessor, featuring higher quality textures, such as Marduk's snake skin pants and Nina's cleavage-revealing body suit, that make the models come alive. 

"Tekken 4" combatants fight in expansive environments featuring a foggy lab, a jungle stage with reflective water and a beautifully modeled roof top featuring breakable statues. Surprisingly, stages feature fully modeled spectators that move out of the way and take hits when a fighter is propelled into the crowd. Although pretty, some of the new stages are uninspired, such as the mall parking garage or the boring lab, which consists of a square shaped room. 

And talk about boring, the music is the worst elevator muzak you've ever heard: sleep inducing. 

Although it's about time the Playstation 2 received its own "Tekken," "Tekken 4" is a big step down for the series. Initially the game shines with polish, but it wears down once you notice Namco fell short on the job. Whatever you do, please give this game a rent first. Once you beat the story mode and "Tekken Force" mode, there isn't much replay value. Although the game is far from a dud, an above average fighter with enough new substance to be enjoyable, make no mistake, it is not the best "Tekken" game out there. If you want that game, you want "Tekken Tag Tournament."

Headline: Red Sun Down brightens local scene
Author: Saudy Pena
&nbsp;
You'd probably find yourself very hard pressed to name a rock band, an accomplished and significant one, which has its roots in South Florida. Sure, we've had our local glories, but these have been few and far between.

But try telling that to the eager, neophyte members of  North Miami's own Red Sun Down, who, after the recent return of vocalist and lyricist Jacob Addicott and several bass player replacements, are busily redefining themselves so as to defy the odds. 

Red Sun Down started back in 1995 under various names like Shafft, Oddrock and Undersound, before deciding on Red Sun Down (a jumbled-up version of the Undersound moniker with a "w").

Caught in the middle of the Nirvana hype, North Miami Beach High ninth graders Addicott, Justin Sclafani and Leore Manelis decided they should start a band. 

Addicott says he first had the idea when in the seventh grade he discovered a tape by The Doors. "That made me want to write," he says. "Ever since then, I knew I wanted to become a musician."

 But first the 15-year-olds had to learn their instruments. "Leore won't admit it, but I actually taught him to play the drums," says Sclafani. "We each taught ourselves as well as each other."

After Undersound, the band decided to take a break for college. Addicott would move up to Tallahassee while Scalafani and Manelis remained in North Miami (becoming members of a band called Coming Soon). 

The trio would still get together and jam in the summertime, but it wasn't until 2002 when Addicott returned from Tallahassee and Drew Harris, the talented bassist from Coming Soon, joined, that the four became the self-proclaimed rock stars of Red Sun Down.

Invited to their routine Saturday afternoon practice sessions, I listened in on what can best be described as an admirable work in progress.          

Before entering the second story office area in guitarist Sclafani's home, (their jam site) I was greeted by front man Addicott at the door. "Hey, follow me," he said simply as we ascended the stairs, his comfy sandals making clapping noises in front of me.

I entered the cramped rehearsal room. Pictures of Sclafani's relatives were hanging by a computer desk and Harris, the bass player, was sitting barefoot on a black piano chair, his Washburn classic model bass resting on his lap. 

They had set up all their equipment and were visibly ready to jam.  Manelis, who was sitting behind his Pearl drums, waved and Sclafani, sitting on an office chair, offered a quick nod and hello while slowly strumming his brand new cherry-red Ibanez guitar.

Almost before I got settled in, Addicott handed me a pair of ear muffs, since I was sitting dangerously close to the drums.

They jumped right into their first song, "Hobo," a powerful but loose tune that shoots to be a Pearl Jam-like, intense head-banger. Addicott's voice, (a nice mixture of Bush's Gavin Rossdale and Puddle of Mud's Wesley Reid Scantlin) along with Manelis' explosive drumming, gave the song an amusing appeal.

They then played "Sorry," a relieving, softer song. Sclafani opened up on this one with a simple and colorful chord progression as the jumpiness and alternating rhythm created an almost mystical feel. Harris gave a fine groove, coating the song with his fuzzy bass line. This is possibly one of their more textured and melodic songs.

After messing around for a bit and discussing arrangements for a possible show in Miami Lakes, they dove into "Lookin," a heavy but funky song that uses the contemporary rap-rock feel of bands like Incubus and Limp Bizkit. 

Addicott's shivering voice,  along with Sclafani's distorted guitar riffs enveloped this song with a controlled fury. It works nicely despite the simplicity of the lyrics: "And it's so hollow in here if you don't know what you're lookin' for/but don't blow your candle out just yet/let these hollow walls close you in."

The next song, "Stripped and Teased" is a crack at a secular Creedish ode about self torment and pain. It went terribly awry in the end when a punkish and thrashy twist was tossed in, losing a bit of focus. After three more songs, they wrapped up the set.

They explained to me that what they want at this point is to "earn respect." Their philosophy is that rock is not dead, just overproduced, and their goal is to stand out from the rest of the formulaic scene. 

Listening to them, you can tell how difficult this task can be as the band is heavily influenced by perhaps too many different styles.

"We're now just getting started," says Addicott. "I just came down from FSU and we've done a couple of shows." 

All 20-year-old FIU students (except Harris, he's 21), the members of the band will be hitting the studio to record their first demo in November. 

In the meantime they want to build a better fan base and get themselves recognized. 

"A good show constitutes people," says Addicott.  "The more people, the more energy we get out of it. That and a good sound system."

As I made my way out of the home after the rehearsal, I realized all these guys need is more time to mature musically and develop a sound that is truly their own. Most of the great ones didn't start 'till late, right? Oh wait, Robert Plant joined what was to be Led Zeppelin at age 19. 

Whatever, that doesn't count. They are all good looking.That always helps.

Curious listeners can catch them at the Biscayne Bay Campus on Nov. 23. They'll be playing at 6:45 p.m. in the WUC along with School For Heroes and A Questionable Element. It's a free show.
