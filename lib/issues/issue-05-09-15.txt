Hello, my name is Alejandro Almirola and I am a Junior with a double major in history and political science. My complaint with the FIU administration that I have is that they have lying to us about opening new restaurnants and the gameroom by the fall of 2005. What happened with that promise and what's their excuse in denying us, the students, our legitimate rights of having a gameroom to chill out and relax? They have been teasing us for two years about expanding this and expanding that in order to better serve us as they say. But in reality, it seems that the only people benefitting from this is the administration who keep expanding their overvalued offices at the expense of the students who are getting exploited for menial superficial fixes. I would appreciate it if the editor took the time to grill the administration in its lapses of promises to the student body that we have patiently put up with. Thanks for your consideration.

Headline: AIR - RAIDED
Subheadline: Strock's team allows 518 passing yards 
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Going into the Sept. 10 game, the Golden Panthers knew they had to execute well on offense in order to have a semblance of a chance against No. 19 Texas Tech. But despite having 349 total yards and 26 first downs, FIU only managed three points on offense in a 56-3 Red Raider rout. 

In their first game against a ranked Division I-A opponent, the Golden Panthers squandered opportunities in the redzone - including two fourth-down situations and a fumble at the three-yard line (which resulted in a 97-yard scoring drive for Texas Tech).

The Golden Panthers defense, which forced four turnovers that led to 21 points against Kansas State, had an opposite performance from the prior week as they forced no turnovers and allowed 653 yards of total offense - 518 of which were through the air.

"Obviously, this was a very tough offense to defend. We had some poor tackling and it became a combination of them breaking tackles and us missing tackles. Offensively, we fumbled twice but had 26 first downs and two times inside the 10. We dropped balls that should have gone for touchdowns," said head coach Don Strock. 

"You can't have those things, especially playing on the road against the caliber of a team as Texas Tech. Overall, there were a lot of bright spots as far as the game was concerned. The final score is not indicative of the way we played in a lot of areas but obviously we need a lot of work in some areas, too."

FIU squandered its first scoring opportunity when, trailing 14-0 late in the first quarter, running back Julian Reams fumbled deep in Red Raider territory. The Golden Panthers drove 62 yards down the field to the Texas Tech eight-yard line before Reams's fumble was recovered at the three.

Texas Tech took advantage of the turnover and drove the ball 97-yards for a score in a drive that took a little under three minutes.

FIU got their only points of the game off a field goal with 6:49 left in the second quarter - trailing 21-0. Kicker Adam Moss's 36-yard field goal was the result of a 15 play, 61-yard drive - highlighted by five FIU first downs.

Quarterback Josh Padrick finished the game 21-for-32 with 172 yards passing. Reams led the FIU running game with 82 of their 135 yards and had one lost fumble.

Wide receiver Chandler Williams led all receivers with 74 yards on seven receptions. Samuel Smith also had seven receptions, for 45 yards.

"I don't care [about my numbers]." Williams said. "All I care about is winning."

On another note, for the second consecutive week, FIU played in front of its largest crowd ever. The 50,156 on hand in Lubbock, Texas was also Texas Tech's largest opening day crowd since 1979 when they played host to the University of Southern California.

"Once you're in the game, you don't really notice [the big crowd]," said cornerback Nick Turnbull, who finished the game with four tackles.

The Golden Panthers go on bye week to prepare for their Sept. 24 trip to Jonesboro, Ark., where they  play Arkansas State in their first game against a Sun Belt Conference opponent this season.

That game will be televised as part of the SBC's ESPN Regional package.

Headline: Pro soccer coming to Miami

&nbsp;
Beginning next summer, South Florida soccer fans will have the chance to attend professional men's soccer games and root for their home country.

The World Indoor Soccer League, featuring teams from North, Central and South America, will kick off in June of 2006 at the Miami Arena.

Founded by Steven Heller - an entrepreneur who has also been involved with franchising in the National Indoor Football League and American Basketball Association - will feature a league of 14 to 16 expansion teams with six-on-six action on the field.

"With this league, fans get to root for their home teams with non-stop fast-paced wall to wall action," Heller said, adding that his league will include teams from the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba and Jamaica.

Heller got the idea of forming the league while attending a World Cup qualifying game between Honduras and Trinidad-Tobago last year at the Orange Bowl.

"The first thing I realized was the incredible passion that the South Florida fans have for the game of soccer when national pride is on the line," Heller said. "Even though I was not a native of the two countries playing, the spirit of the people got me into the game. That is what I want to accomplish with the WISL."

At a press conference held Sept. 7 at the Miami Arena, coaches were excited to be part of the league.

"We don't have the MLS anymore so with this league, fans can come out to watch some good soccer," said Peru coach Jesus "El Gato" Purizaga, a former member of the Peru National Soccer team.

Coaches know that it will take quality soccer to bring people to the arena.

"If you build something that is good, the people will come," said Argentina coach Silvano Espindola, a former Argentina Junior player who played with the legendary Diego Maradona.

Each game will be 60 minutes long and broken down into two halves with a 15-minute halftime. According to Morgan Bojorquez, director of league operations, the halftime show will include a recap of soccer highlights from around the world and a quality entertainment show.

"We will bring the passion of the game that we love and halftime shows that will bring the entire family together," Bojorquez said.

Bojorquez stated that countries chosen for the league were picked for tradition and opportunities.

"You look at Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, these are countries that have a tradition for soccer, but countries like Nicaragua and Cuba - known for its baseball - will now have a chance to [participate]," he said.

Heller knows that no other city could have been more appropriate for a soccer league than Miami.

"Miami has the perfect [demographics] for this. People here have the passion for soccer but they don't have a team," Heller said.

The WISL will be holding tryouts Sept. 17-18 at the Miami Arena beginning at 8 a.m.

Headline: Lighting strikes men's soccer
Author: Joshua Rey / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Everything was clicking on Sept. 10 for the men's soccer team as they entered intermission, leading Howard University 3-0. 

The Bison showed no signs of stopping the Golden Panthers' offensive barrage. As it turned out, they didn't need to. Mother Nature did all the dirty work.

   For nearly two-and-a-half hours, lightning filled the skies over University Park, extending intermission far beyond the normal 10 minutes. When tornadoes became a threat, officials called the game.

Because the game did not reach the 70-minute mark, the NCAA declared it a "no contest," wiping out the 3-0 score and all the statistics that went along with it.  

But don't try telling the Golden Panthers the game never happened.

"It was good practice, but I'm still a bit devastated that I lost my first goal of the season and my first assist," said junior forward David Hope with a big smile on his face,   revealing that he'd live on. "Hopefully there will be more to come."

For the 45-minutes FIU and Howard competed, the Golden Panthers gave fans a glimpse of greatness. Speedster forward Carron Williams set the tone in the 13th minute, driving the ball into the Howard box before passing to fellow senior Lucas Scudeler, who scored on a nifty left-footed kick into the upper-left hand corner of the net.

"When Carron gave me the ball, I saw the keeper out of position and I felt like I could score, so I hit it in the corner," Scudeler said.  

Freshman forward Judah Hernandez, who turned heads three nights earlier when he scored the game-winning goal against Florida Atlantic, nearly made the score 2-0.   Hernandez juked and jived his way past four Howard defenders to the delight of the crowd, before being cutoff by Howard goalkeeper Jason Williams.  

The turning point of the half came when head coach Karl Kremser turned to his bench, namely Hope and freshman forward/midfielder Levi Coleman. 

The pair made the most of their limited minutes.  At 4:40, Coleman passed off to Hope, who kicked the ball off the crossbar and into the net. Following the goal, Hope sprinted toward his teammates on the sideline and made a hand gesture similar to that of a surfer.

"That's all about the Brazilians," said Hope, who entered FIU three years ago from England.  "The Brazilians are some of the best players in the world, so why not try to be like one?"

Brazilians must also be generous because not four minutes had gone by before Hope had the ball in another scoring position. But this time, he kicked a cross pass to Coleman who scored FIU's third goal of the night, grazing the crossbar on the right side.

"I had to pay him back because he gave me a nice ball for my goal," Hope said. "So I thought I'd return the favor to him."

FIU took a 3-0 lead into the locker room at intermission, but never returned due to lightning. The team did not learn until late Monday afternoon that the win, and the statistics, were null and void. Especially disappointed was Coleman, who had the first goal and assist of his college career erased from the record books.

"It was a little frustrating," said Coleman when learning the news. "But it was good for my confidence level, so I can be more confident when I go out and play again. I know that I can do that and get another goal."

Coleman will get another chance when FIU hosts the FIU Diadora Classic Sept. 16 and Sept. 18. The Golden Panthers take the field Sept. 16 at 7:30 p.m., against Alabama A & M. Then, on Sept. 18, FIU hosts Xavier at 2 p.m. Students can gain free admission by presenting their PantherCard outside the soccer stadium.

Headline: American League wild card race brings many surprises
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As of Sept. 13, the Cleveland Indians - that's right the Cleveland INDIANS! lead the American League wild-card race by one and a half games over the New York Yankees, while the Oakland Athletics sit two and a half back and two games behind the AL West-leading Anaheim Angels.

With less than 20 games left to play, these teams find themselves in must-win situations if they hope to reach the postseason.

After wrapping up a crucial three-game home stand against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees find themselves only three games behind the defending champions as luck is beginning to turn their way.

One thing Yankee fans have to be thrilled about is the fact that Randy Johnson threw a seven-inning shutout against the Red Sox on Sept. 11. If they're going to make a push for the playoffs, he'll have to carry them.

Aaron Small and Shawn Chacon have also stepped up big and have surprisingly been the leaders of the rotation. 

Just think, three months ago Aaron Small was coming off a sub par season and had no idea where he was going to land and Shawn Chacon was getting racked in Coors Field. 

Now, they are rounding out a struggling rotation and coming up big in crucial games. 

As of Sept. 11, Aaron Small has a 2.93 ERA and Shawn Chacon has his ERA just under four. That's pretty good for two pitchers who couldn't get into starting rotations on below .500 teams. Now, the Yankees find themselves saying,  "Where would we be if it weren't for them?"

The probable return of Carl Pavano should boost this rotation even more and will allow Al Leiter to remain in that long-reliever spot, a position where the Yankees badly need an arm.	

Even though their bullpen consists of two great relievers at the bottom, with Tom Gordon and Mariano Rivera, they seem to be getting overworked and somebody needs to fill the void in the sixth and seventh innings.	

Although the pitching staff is looking a little better, their offense is going to be what sets them apart. That is why it is such a good sign to see Bernie Williams and Jason Giambi really get going offensively.

Giambi's productivity provides a solid left-handed bat in the middle of their lineup and better pitches for Alex Rodriguez, Gary Sheffield and Hideki Matsui to feast off of.

Bernie Williams has gone as far as hitting second in the Red Sox series. This allows rookie second baseman Robinson Cano to slide into that seventh or eight spot where he feels more comfortable. 

Despite injuries and all their disappointments, you  have to assume the Yankees will not fall short of the postseason. They have too much playoff experience and talent to not be able to get in. 

However, they better watch their backs, because the Indians don't seem to be letting up.

After being one of the top teams in the 90s and almost winning three World Series championships, the Indians are in the hunt again. But this time, there's no Albert Belle or Jim Thome rocking fat bats. It's Travis Hafner and Coco Crisp leading the way.

There seems to be nothing bad to say about the Indians' play thus far. They're playing great defense, running the bases aggressively and pounding on American League pitching.  They have a very young nucleus of talented players and are going to be a great team for years to come.  

The Indians also have three great starters at the top of their pitching rotation - Kevin Millwood, C.C. Sabathia and Cliff Lee; plus an all-star closer in Bob Wickman.

The only question they have facing them is vulnerability. None of their everyday players, except Kevin Millwood, have any playoff experience - an element that has proven to be very crucial in September.

The Oakland A's lost two-thirds of their top starting pitchers to trades and we're still talking about them in mid-September. Why? Well, great starting and relief pitching will help.

After two disappointing seasons following his Cy-Young year in 2002, Barry Zito has been solid with a 3.60 ERA. But Rich Harden has been the success-story thus far.

The Oakland starter posts a 10-5 record to go along with a 2.60 ERA this season. Add rookie sensation closer Huston Street to the picture and what you have is one of the best young pitching staffs in the league.

The A's can't slug their way into the post-season, like the Yankees and Red Sox, but just ask the Chicago White Sox, Atlanta Braves, and Los Angeles Angels and they'll tell you hitting is overrated.

However, the A's offense is not average like these other clubs; it's down-right embarrassing. They're in the middle of the pack in every single offensive category except stolen bases - where they're dead last.

Offensively, they can't get on base, hit for power, play small ball or steal bases. This adds a lot of pressure to that young pitching staff, and that's asking too much.

This is the time of year where experience paves the way and youthful vulnerability gets exposed. We all know anything can happen in baseball and these next few weeks will give testament to that.

Will the $200 million Yankees be taken out by the youthful Indians? Can the Oakland A's get by on Rich Harden and Huston Street? Only time will tell.

Un-sweet dreams:  Mike and Sharen Gravelle from Wakeman, Ohio had their 11 foster children taken away. Deputies found the children sleeping in 3 1/2' cages. Some of the children suffered from autism and fetal alcohol syndrome. The couple said they did this after their psychiatrist suggested cages to keep the children from hurting each other. The children have now been placed with four other foster families. Needless to say, we hope they don't frequent a psychiatrist.

Headline: The Political Divide: Who is the real winner?
Subheadline: Republican
Author: Christopher Necuze / Contriuting Writer
&nbsp;
America: Liberal or Conservative?  As we go about our everyday lives in wonder of our country, politicians, political analysts and some rather outspoken primetime news reporters peruse this very question on a nightly basis.  

Unfortunately, all these people are wasting precious tax dollars and air time and the answer to this question has never changed.

If you are a Democrat, Nov. 2, 2004 is a day to forget. Not only did you lose the presidential race, but you lost four seats in the Senate and three seats in the House. To add insult to injury, Tom Daschle became the first Senate leader to be ousted by an opponent since 1952.  

A measure banning same-sex marriages was passed in all 11 states where it was on the ballot, and in Florida, an amendment to the constitution passed requiring parental notification before a minor can have an abortion.  

Sure, you had some victories, but those were heavily overshadowed by the losses. So what does this mean?  Republicans won this election because, quite frankly, they told the largest block of voters exactly what they wanted to hear. Interestingly enough, Iraq was not as big a part of that message as you would think.  

 Some critics said, "Bush won because all the Christians went to the polls."  So what?  

When it comes to getting people to the polls, Republicans do a better job.  

There is absolutely nothing wrong with mobilizing a base. All it means is that more people are able to get their voices heard.  

So what if all members of a church group decide they are going to vote for President Bush because he is against abortion? It is their right, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. They vote for what issue they feel is most important, just like you do. 

In the case of this election, small town morals were the name of the game. While the main stream media was following developments in Iraq, social issues - abortion, same-sex marriages and stem cell research - were taking center stage in the living rooms of average Americans. 

These issues were being addressed in churches and religious institutions all across the country, not just the Bible Belt. 

Ironically enough, these were the issues that mattered most to the people casting the ballots, not the war. When all you could hear was Iraq this and Iraq that, people who nobody ever expected to vote in the first place got to the polls and voted for what they felt mattered in their hearts. And whether you like it or not, it was not Iraq, and that is perfectly fine - because that is democracy.  

The failure of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to realize what was truly in the hearts of everyday Americans, the people who make up the majority of the voting block, is what lost Democrats the election.  

It was their futile efforts to deface the Bush administration based on its record in Iraq, while paying little to no attention to the social issues that were on peoples minds, that did them in.  

When they did speak of the issues, it simply was not what the people wanted to hear.  You see, it is not that America is becoming a conservative country; it is that America has always been a conservative country.  

Surely, this is not evident in our college campuses where liberals reign and conservatives are the minority.  

It is in the small towns of this land, the towns that average people call home and the towns you never hear about on the news, that conservatism thrives.  

It is not that the country is moving towards the right; it is that Democrats are moving towards the left. And as they nudge their way to the left, they leave Americans' social values behind.  

Sure, Democrats had a message in the last election, and whether that message was right or wrong, we will never know.  But what we do know, is that it was not the message Americans were looking for.

Headline: The Political Divide: Who is the real winner?
Subheadline: Democrat 
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Do we really live in a conservative country? In the aftermath of Election 2004, Americans have given much thought to this exact question. Being besieged by conservative propaganda on MSNBC and Fox News surely leads many to think that America is, as a whole, conservative. 

Doesn't George W. Bush's reelection confirm it? Not quite. The more politically astute among us will likely declare the United States "centrist" or at the least, simply "not conservative."

Election 2004 was about much more than just Bush winning the reelection. The presidential campaigns of Bush and democrat John Kerry were bash fests aimed at discrediting one another and were overwhelmingly financed by elitist individuals and special interest groups. 

The average American voter lacked any significant financial stake in either campaign; hence their interests were essentially neglected. The Kerry campaign's fatal goal was to brutalize Bush's record and to turn Kerry into a savior Americans could turn to. He lacked the passion and purpose that progressive grassroot efforts used to mobilize their members. Kerry trusted policy over purpose, and lost. 

The Bush campaign used its millions to stake ownership on morality and defacing Kerry's brilliant Vietnam record. Money, power and fear won. The campaigns effectively muted the voices of millions of voters. These facts alone lack the capability to prove America to be conservative. The power and money of a few cannot claim to speak for the millions of average American voters. We can find the true mindsets and intentions of voters in the initiatives and campaigns where financial contributions did not play as much a factor in the outcome.

The democratic/progressive movement can claim numerous important successes from Election 2004. Among them are:

*  Voters in Florida and Nevada increased the federal minimum wage by a dollar to $6.15 an hour. While Gov. Jeb Bush and pro-business groups opposed the increase, 71 percent of Floridians supported the measure. Support in Nevada was nearly as strong with 68 percent backing the increase.

* The seven democratic senators who voted against the Iraq war all won reelection; Barbara Boxer-CA (58 percent-38 percent), Russ Feingold-WS (55-44), Daniel Inouye-HA (76-21), Patrick Leahy-VT (71-25), Barbara Mikulski-MD (65-34), Patty Murray-WA (55-43) and Ron Wyden-OR (63-32)

* Democrats in Montana, Dick Cheney's home state, won the governor office and attorney general's office, took control of the state senate and gained control of the Public Service Commission, the state's main regulatory agency. Voters also approved the use of medical marijuana with a doctor's recommendation by a 62-38 percent margin.

* Democrats retook the North Carolina house and now control both chambers of the state congress; democrats also won Colorado's chambers for the first time in 44 years.

* Democrat Lupe Valdez, an openly gay Hispanic female, was elected as sheriff in Dallas County, Texas where Bush won by 10,000 votes. Dallas County had never had a female, a Hispanic or an openly gay sheriff.

Progressive democrats can take these victories as a sign of what the American pulse is. In raising the minimum wage, Floridians and Nevadans shunned the pro-business lobby and clearly demonstrated its support of lower class workers. 

Through its approval of medical marijuana use, Montana voters sided with medicine rather than with an extreme conservative agenda. Texans voted for tolerance and inclusiveness through its election of Lupe Valdez.

Such progressive successes were unfortunately kept out of the mainstream media. Nevertheless, it is clear that when Americans aren't exposed to extreme propaganda and negatively themed corporately financed campaigns, their views are more inclined towards the traditional Democratic Party platform. If nothing else, it should provide hope for progressive-minded Americans. 

With passionate candidates, determined supporters and financial contributions from all sects of the American electorate, there is no doubt the damage done by the current Republican majority can be reversed and the prosperity enjoyed during the 1990s can once again become a reality.

Headline: Locals, Bush play the New Orleans blame game
Author: Andre Bisasor / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Although at first glance, blame for the Hurricane Katrina aftermath failures seem to lay squarely at the feet of the Bush administration, further analysis reveals a level of complication to the breakdown than first realized.  

The first point of breakdown was the failure of the local city government of New Orleans to update it's evacuation plan to address the known logistical problems of transporting 100,000 people within a day or two under disaster emergency circumstances. 

The second point of breakdown was the failure of both local and state governments to ensure that designated shelters [i.e. the superdome] had food, water and medical supplies - both before, but especially immediately after the storm hit. 

The third point of breakdown was the failure of the federal government to swiftly bring in the necessary military support to assist in resource allocation, evacuation, medical assistance and other emergency procedures. This is where, logically, some blame can be honestly and unquestioningly assigned to George W. Bush and his administration. 

Why did it take six days for the federal government to respond to what was an unprecedented catastrophe in this nation's history? 

Although it could be argued that local and state governments dropped the ball in the pre-planning and preparation, it is known that local and state mechanisms are quickly strained or exhausted in major catastrophic situations. This is why FEMA exists. 

By day two, it was clear that a major catastrophic event had occurred, superseding local emergency response mechanisms and requiring federal intervention. From an analytical standpoint, it is the delay between day one  and day  six by federal entities that caused extra suffering, unnecessary deaths and avoidable harm that metastasized a devastating situation into one that became unbearably and disgracefully "hellish".  

Although some would like to deflect all blame to local and state government leaders, it is this five to six day delay that logically cannot be ignored or dodged. The delivery of  food, water and supplies by federal government cargo or military helicopters and the deployment of amphibious all-terrain military trucks were not obstructed by flood-water. So the only reason that these assets were not deployed in a timely manner was that somebody decided not to deploy them. 

Whether this decision was due to a crippling bureaucratic system or to ethnic indifference, the fact is that the federal government had the power and the where-withal to move sooner and thus save lives. Somebody in the federal government dropped the ball and that somebody needs to be held accountable.

There are claims that it is counter-productive to raise questions concerning these failures because it is more important to focus now on the on-going emergency of displaced homeless residents, the containment of the potential public health hazards that exist and the rebuilding of the city itself. Yet although this retort has the face of compelling logic, under closer scrutiny it reveals a fundamental flaw. 

First, we are still in the middle of hurricane season and the national hurricane center estimates that there will be at least three more major hurricanes that will hit the southern shores of the United States over the next few months. Second, there is still an imminent threat of some type of terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Both of these scenarios require an effective emergency response mechanism, especially at the federal level. 

If there are incompetent people running the show, then we need to know as quickly as possible so that the right people can be brought in. Also, if certain response procedures are impractical, then these "red-tape" bottlenecks need to be identified and eradicated now. 

To suggest that the government cannot both contain the current emergency while at the same time review it's mistakes is to imply that "it cannot both walk and chew gum at the same time" as if it were some poor third world government. This suggestion is nothing but an attempt to defuse the brewing political firestorm evidenced by Bush's falling poll numbers and the up-swell of criticism already underway. 

The American people have the right to immediately question and hold its government accountable for gross negligence which has resulted in the unnecessary loss of life and avoidable suffering of its own citizens. 

Another equally spurious suggestion is that since some responsibility may lie on the shoulders of local and state government leaders in not effectively pre-planning for this event, then therefore no blame should be assigned to the Bush administration. 

This argument is fallacious for two reasons. Firstly, this is a "two wrongs make a right" fallacy.  Secondly, the lack of proper pre-planning and foresight in possible disaster emergency scenarios by local government is "qualitatively" different from the lack of timely deployment of assets by the federal government in response to an "actual" disaster within the initial critical period.  

The two are not equivalent. Yet, further investigation reveals that the Bush administration bears some responsibility for the lack of preparation in New Orleans as well. 

For example, a year ago the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed to study how New Orleans could be protected from a catastrophic hurricane (including the strengthening, renovation of levees and pumping stations), but the Bush administration ordered that the research not be undertaken, instead diverting funds to the Iraq war.

Some have pointed to the fact that since day six, there has been an overwhelming deployment of resources to New Orleans. 

Yet, action on day seven cannot save the lives already lost during the six day period of delay. And nobody can dare suggest that families, who lost loved ones during that critical time period, do not have the right to ask questions about the lack of response during that critical initial period. 

These criticisms can be considered legitimate, non-partisan and objective in as much as these same sentiments have been echoed by the likes of prominent conservatives as well.

Headline: Constitution Day celebrated
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
In honor of the newly designated Constitution Day, the College of Law will host a panel discussion on the Supreme Court and the justice selection process at 1 p.m., in Graham Center 140. 

"With the hearings on the way for justice positions [we thought] that this was a very appropriate time to discuss those issues," said Leonard Strickman, dean of the College of Law.

The focus of the event is on how court justices are selected and what the Constitution provides with respect to that. FIU professors will offer their expertise on the panel where each will give a short presentation followed by a question and answer session. 

Strickman put together the panel of professors and will moderate the event. The panel consists of professors from the College of Law and from the department of political science. 

Assistant professor of Law, Howard Wasserman, will give a presentation on the Senate's role in the selection process. 

"It will give students the opportunity to learn about the process up close and for the first time," said Wasserman.

This week, the Senate is holding hearings for the nomination of John G. Roberts to succeed the late William Rehnquist as chief justice. If the Senate approves of the nomination, then 50-year-old Roberts will make important decisions for the United States for decades to come. 

Most undergraduates ranging from the ages of 20-21 have never experienced the process of selecting a chief justice. 

"The forthcoming changes in the membership of our Supreme Court are something most FIU students have never seen.  Learning more about the judicial selection process can add to a better understanding of the Court's importance in the American politics and the lives of all citizens," said Dr. Rebecca Mae Salokar, associate professor for department of political science. 

General Tommy Franks will lead the preamble recitation this year at 2 p.m.  Eastern time. This year's Constitution Day celebration is dedicated to the military.

Regional:
Black enrollment down in Florida universities

Florida universities continue to grow, but new figures released last week show the number of black students attending college in the state have dropped significantly from a year ago.

The decline is seen most clearly at Florida A&M University, a historically black college. More than 90 percent of the student population is black, but its overall enrollment has dropped by some 1,700 students and more than one-fourth in its freshman class since 2004.

Analysts say the steep drop could cause some budget cuts because state funding is usually driven by enrollment.


Nation-Wide:
Lights out in L.A. after wiring snafu 

Lights were out in one of the nation's largest cities on Monday when utility workers in Los Angeles connected wrong wires and caused a massive blackout across major portions of the California city.

About 2 million people were affected by the power outage. Some people were trapped in elevators and others were stuck in dangerous traffic jams at intersections, authorities said.

The power went out during the lunchtime commute at noon on Monday, but was fully restored some five ours later.

Neighboring cities, including Glendale and Burbank, were also affected. 

The blackout came just one day after ABC News aired a videotape apparently from the al Qaeda terrorist network threatening attacks against Los Angeles and parts of Australia four years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on U.S. soil.

The Department of Homeland Security found no indication that the blackout was led by a terrorist organization. 


International:
Officials skeptical of new terror tape

Skepticism continues to grow in the nation's capital over a videotape purportedly released by the al Qaeda terrorist network this weekend.

The tape shows a masked man speaking in English saying, "Yesterday, London and Madrid. Tomorrow, Los Angeles and Melbourne, Allah willing."

U.S. counterterrorism officials say the tape is propaganda put out by al Qaeda marking the fourth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

ABC News broadcasted the tape Sunday. The tape was delivered to the network's Pakistan bureau on Saturday.

Officials believe the speaker in the tape is the same one that called himself "Azzam the American" in a previous tape. 

The FBI has identified him as Adam Gadahn. Authorities say he is originally from the Los Angeles area, but may be living in Pakistan.

The FBI has since interviewed Gadahn's family to confirm he is the speaker in the latest tape.

Headline: Innovations on the way for business school
Author:  Fiona Ogunkoya / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Due to its growth and expansion, the College of Business Administration is running a "Building for Business" building campaign. In which a new business building will be built just northwest of the college's present location at the Ryder Business Building. Groundwork on the new building will start Fall 2005. 

Until its completion, the college continues to make improvements to their facilities at Ryder. For example, construction is beginning on an Information desk at the heart of the Ryder Business building. 

According to Dean Joyce Elam of CBA, "we're implementing a multi-channel strategy" in which students will have easy and quick access to service by the Information Desk, and advising via the Web.

 The CBA has been ranked among the top 15 percent  of accredited business schools along with schools such as University of Florida, George Washington and Rutgers in Business Week's "Best B-Schools". Landon Undergraduate School and Chapman Graduate School of Business rank top ten in U.S. when it comes to

International Business. 

There is a drive, in the college, toward better organization, "We're very much into efficiency, applying what we teach our students to our own operations," said Joyce Elam, the Dean of the Collegeof Business. 

The business school is also deeply connected to the business community. Over 200 business leaders and professionals sit on advisory councils for various kinds of programs run by the Business School, the Downtown M.B.A. - an Executive M.B.A. program - and other flexible degree programs, B.B.A. + (Bachelors of Business Administration Plus) Sunrise, Sunset, and

B.B.A. + Weekends are just a few.

	The school holds a strong commitment to the use of information technology. 

"[We] educate our students in using the technology. It's a way to get better service at a reasonable cost" claims Dean Elam. 

According to 2003-2004 records, only about half of the funding the college of Business Administration receives comes from the state, the other half is necessarily from credit program fees, contracts, grants, and generous donations. Yet, with the 30 million dollars of funding it has, the College does much.

It has a distinguished International Business [IB] Program, and has an IB Honors program. 

 When questioned as to how the college can afford to provide quality programs with its high enrollment numbers and limited funds, Elam replies "Start small, perfect it and expand it." 

The International Business Honors program is a small program offered for Honors college students who are interested in a more expansive view of International Business, taking into account, according to the website, "historical, religious, economic, and political forces at work around the world." Mairim

Perez-Alonso, a sophomore and prospective international business major is looking forward to joining the IB Honors program. 

"Today, everything is like a global community; everything is related, one thing affects the other.

With the kind of global economy we have today, we have to take into account each player," said Perez-Alonso. 

She can find this consideration taken into account in the interdisciplinary IB Honors program. 

The college of Business sees importance not only in being market-focused, and being informed of the latest trends in the business community, but improving organization and service to students within the college. There is a Career Management Services group for business graduate students to prepare them for their careers as well as bring in companies to interview students. 

Undergraduates business majors are not left out as there is work going on to provide a liaison, part of the University Career Services, but assigned and devoted specifically to the business school.  In addition, and unknown to many, Business majors, due to the importance their college places on matching students with the numerous employing companies that call looking for interns, part-time and full-time workers, the college pays the $20 fee to join Career Services. 

 Despite a drop in enrollment in other colleges, enrollment numbers in the College of Business Administration have remained constant. Strong accreditation standards constrain the number of  full-time faculty available (109) and the number of students that are able to be taught. The issue is in the ability to teach students with academically, qualified faculty, in technology-enabled classrooms.

Headline: WebCT offers alternative to students
Author: Jeniffer Galasso / Assistant Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
The average college student usually does not tend to work full-time and is able to manage scheduling their required classes for the semester without much of a hassle. However, with today's fast paced world , especially in a growing city like Miami and older men and women taking college classes  - this is not always the case. For these students, at times, it becomes very complicated to take  classes they need during a time slot that does not interfere with work schedules or other priorities. Enter WebCT Courses.

"I am a full-time worker who has worked his way up, while barely taking classes each semester because [of] the time that it took to actually go to attend class. Finally, I have hit my undergraduate studies and FIU tailors a program to those who must support themselves and devote much of their time to business," said junior finance major Daniel J. Holloway.

WebCT courses are classes that are taken fully online. There are stands all around the university with a listing of available online courses and further information can be found at the WebCT homepage. As it stands: international business and finance are the two undergraduate degrees that can be completed via only online classes.

Online students are able to take quizzes, exams, submit work, and communicate with the professors. The syllabus is always available on the site. Grades are posted online, and the system averages all your grades making them available to you whenever you wish to see your progress in the class; therefore information that would usually take time out of your day and a walk to a professor's office is now just a click away. There is also the convenience of being able to communicate with your professors via the WebCT mail, which is guaranteed to reach your professor, unlike other e-mail accounts that sometimes are blocked due to virus issues. 

"You can also easily decipher between the teachers being different from others by the way they address the class. They address their class more frequently than an on-campus teacher would," added Holloway.

These classes have become a life savor for students who cannot find their class during a time slot they are available. However, do keep in mind that these classes demand self-discipline and organization. 

It is imperative that you check the website daily to make sure your professor hasn't made any changes towards assignments or due dates. Also, most students seem to believe that by taking an online class you lose out on any chance to be part of a study group, this is not true. 

"I think online classes are great, mainly for international students, since we end up paying half as much as we normally would. I like the fact that you can get everything done with an extremely flexible schedule and they're pretty lively as far as interaction with other students," said junior Boris Vanier.

Students all have a discussion forum on their class site that enables you to communicate with other students. Most take advantage by posting requests for live study sessions and making plans to meet at the library or elsewhere on campus. 

If you are a student that likes to plan early, online classes are great for you. Due to the nature of the class, professors post all assignments and exam/quizzes, but please remember that due dates can also be changed, which is why its important to check the site daily . 

The downside to online classes is the additional $295 fee. This fee covers the additional technology infrastructure needed for the website, faculty and additional customer service personnel - costs not covered by state funds. For any additional questions regarding online classes contact Claudia Bonilla, the E-advisor. You can e-mail her with any questions or concerns online@fiu.edu or visit the WebCT homepage at http://www.estudent.fiu.edu.

Headline: Faculty takes over student lounge
Author: Helen Berggren / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Lounge, located in room 245 at the Wolfe University Center, is a rare commodity on the Biscayne Bay Campus. Peaceful and air-conditioned, the refuge offers students a place to catch up on studies, work on group projects or just catch a snooze on a comfy couch. 

But now, between 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., on Mondays through Thursdays, students will not be allowed to use this space.

The enclosed room has been handed over to the Wolfe University Center to be used as BBCs Faculty Club. 

Students were alarmed by the change.

"That's horrible," said Jessica Villasuso who is maoring in psychology. "That's not fair. Sometimes I have a three hour interval and need a quiet place to study - somewhere that is air-conditioned. There should be an alternative. Reserving a room at the library takes time. It can be a hassle."

"It is a refuge from all the noise," said  Michael Haines who is majoring journalism print. "It's quiet, air-conditioned and a great place to study or take a nap in between classes. The library is too far away from where all the classes are."

 The carved wooden dining chairs are nowhere to be found. The overstuffed couches are also missing. A steamer buffet station has taken their place.

 Natkisha Baptiste, BBC student government council president, did not return phone calls. But Lemar Linton, SGA vice president, explained that his organization made a decision to allow the faculty to use the space just three hours a day, between Monday and Thursday. 

"The plan is they will use it from 11 [a.m.] to 2 [p.m.]. It is only for this semester. They start at 11, use it for three hours and break it back down into a student lounge. During that time, the staff is supposed to direct students to the third floor lounge which has been refurbished to accommodate students."

The Beacon accompanied Linton for a tour of the Student Lounge and the "re-furbished" third floor lounge.

 Located near the Department of Parking & Transportation, the noisy, open space lacking tables and chairs, share only two things in common with Room 245: it is air-conditioned and the modular chairs can be pushed together into couches.

 Linton seemed surprised by the extent of the changes. 

"The [Student Lounge] couches were supposed to be moved back everyday." Linton said. "I'm going to have to talk to them about it."

When asked about obtaining a copy of the documents pertaining to the new arrangements for the Student Lounge, Linton said he would "get back to [us] on it."

 Vice Provost Raul Moncarz, who has wanted a working faculty club at BBC for some time, insisted that students were still a priority. 

 "Students are very important and the faculty is very important to us," Moncarz said. "The faculty club is not just for the faculty. It is for everyone and we don't exclude anyone from any room. The students were nice enough to let us use the room for two-and-a half hours a day. Then the room is turned back into a student lounge."

Moncarz did not know the whereabouts of the three couches or the carved wooden chairs, and seemed uncertain as to how long the faculty club would have to use the room.  

"Maybe for one year, hopefully, one year," Moncarz said.

Greg Olson, director of campus life, said there were no documents. "The agreement was verbal," he said, "We left the tables because we thought they would actually be better for students to sit and study."

And the three couches?

"They were moved to the hallway," he said.

After being informed that the sofas were not in the hallway and were presumed missing, Olson replied, "We need to get those back in there."

Olson then directed further questions to Craig Cunningham, director of Campus Life, who explained WUC's authority over the change.

 "That is a part of WUC and technically WUC can designate whatever they want to do with that space," Cunningham said.

For now, students will have to make do with reduced hours and the discomfort. 

"What are we, less than the faculty? We pay them. So now, we can only go to the library? We can't talk there. Where are we going to go?" said Leslie Hernandez who is majoring in public relations.

Headline: Life of famous rocker brought to the big screen in the movie, Last Days
Author: Jason Geller /Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"Underneath the bridge/
The tarp has sprung a leak/
And the animals I've trapped/
Have all become my pets/
And I'm living off of grass/
And the drippings from the ceiling
It's OK to eat fish/
'Cause they don't have any feelings."

When a movie based on the life of a rock star premieres, it usually illustrates the glorious conquest of women (Val Kilmer, The Doors), the exhilaration of stardom (Mark Wahlberg, Rock Star) or even the pure innocence of youth (Kate Hudson, Almost Famous). 

Rarely does a film disregard the glamour and groupies, the drugs and debauchery, the limelight and adulation and present the reality.  

Disregarding that fame, money and excess do indeed take a toll on the body and they do bring about insurmountable pressure.

All that pressure can be summed up in the eyes of Blake (Michael Pitt, Murder by Numbers) a tormented musician with sweat drenched hair and tortured blue eyes, Pitt portrays Gus Van Sant's depiction of the late Nirvana front-man Kurt Cobain and his last days on earth in the indie movie, Last Days.

Blake, usually dressed in denim jeans and torn shirts, wanders around his Victorian estate.  

He eats cereal, watches T.V. and drudges through nearby streams and woods, performing everyday mundane things. But it is not the action that takes place in Last Days that makes the film so captivating, it is how the movie makes you feel.

Pitt bares a resemblance to Cobain that is frightening and his dialogue, which is mainly incoherent mumbling rather than actual words, offers a haunting portrayal of what life must be like for someone so close to the end of it.

Blake does not partake in any human contact, save for a brief conversation with a door-to-door salesman.  

His friends, or "cling-ons," which are never filmed together on-screen, offer neither support nor solace.  

They attempt to contact him on occasion, but Blake maintains his isolation and remains silent as they attempt to communicate with him via phone.

The movie is worth seeing solely for the acoustic scene. Blake performs in his own house, alone and without fans or fanfare, a song Pitt wrote and performed himself entitled "Death to Birth." Blake strums his guitar strings slowly and steadily, gradually building up to a climax that is all too reminiscent of MTV's Nirvana "Unplugged" and all too familiar to a generation that lost a legend.

Headline: Virtual reality exercise bike brings the outdoors to you
Author: Lisa Liddane / The Orange County Register
&nbsp;
Virtual reality (VR) exercise machines debuted in the mid-`90s, and quickly went the way of "Seinfeld Chronicles" - the first version of "Seinfeld." Both received positive reviews, appealed to some people, but failed to reach a wide audience.

We all know what eventually happened with the relaunched version, "Seinfeld" - major hit. Expresso Fitness, a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based maker of the next generation of VR exercise machines, is hoping the same might happen to the Spark, their new stationary VR exercise bike. 

The Spark made the rounds two weeks ago throughout Southern California, including stops at some Orange County health clubs. I checked out the Spark to see what improvements have been made since 1996.

At first glance, it looks like a regular stationary bike with an LCD screen mounted in front of the handlebars. It's available with a choice of two saddles - a cushy wide one for those who like to ride comfortably, and an ergonomic racing saddle for those who are more accustomed to riding a road bike.But unlike stationary bikes, the handlebars turn left and right, just as they do on a regular bicycle. You can't raise or lower the handlebars, so you'll have to ride in an upright position. A knob below the handlebars controls a gear shift with (gasp!) 30 gears.

You can choose from 20 routes or virtual worlds. Some are based on real-life routes mapped with a global positioning system. A basic ride takes you along the California coastline for a mile. A moderate course weaves through rocky canyons. A more extreme course snakes through star-filled outer space.

The visuals and courses are a substantial leap from their predecessors, though not as sophisticated as some of the latest video games. The leaves on trees sway as you pass by. The view of the road, as it unfolds ahead of you, is exactly what you would see if you were riding a bike up or down winding roads. You don't lose (or gain) points by running into a squirrel crossing the road or against a wall. You never crash against the barriers even if something or someone distracts you. You can customize the pace to suit your fitness level by adjusting the speed of the pace rider.

Theoretically, you'll be able to compete or ride with exercisers who are working out on other Spark bikes at the gym or even in other health clubs.

To help you track your progress, the screen displays graphs for elevation, heart rate, power, as well as your location on the route, time traveled, calories burned, and other stats.

It's pretty easy to become absorbed in the course and work hard to get to the finish line. And if you really want to tune out the real world, put on the headphones and choose from six music genres, including classic rock and dance.

But even with such improvements, I wondered how the bike could sustain exercisers' interest day after day, week after week, if the routes are the same. After all, the same view can get boring after a while. Brian Button, chief executive officer of Expresso Fitness, says because the bikes are hooked up to the Internet, the company refreshes the music about every month and more stations are being added. 

There also are plans for enhancements to the routes.

Button believes that there's a built-in social connectivity that will develop over time as more bikes are installed in health clubs. People will be able to virtually "ride," even compete with fellow riders in the same fitness center. The VR machines of the `90s offered this feature as well.

The Spark may appeal to stationary bike riders looking for something fresh or different to try. 

But we won't know until next year whether it will succeed in making virtual reality exercise bikes a gym staple or yet another expensive castoff.

Headline: Transporter 2
Subheadline: Hollywood brings the action 
Author: Jason Geller /Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On Sept. 28 of last year, something very different was happening around the Biscayne Bay Campus diving pool. A bright and powerful light, as luminous as the sun, was emitting from the pool.  

More than 100 people (many in scuba gear) holding cameras and strobe lights were gathered around the pools perimeter.  

A huge prop resembling a section of the exterior of a jet was smack dab in the middle of the pool.  

It turns out that a scene from the sequel to the smash hit The Transporter, Transporter 2 was being shot right here at FIU.

For a quick recount, The Transporter is the story of Frank Martin (Jason Statham), a smooth talking no-nonsense former special forces operator, who now works as a transporter.  

Martin simply ships goods from one place to the other.  

However, when Martin happens upon a moving package, he stops along a route to check it out, only to find that the package contains a beautiful woman named Lai (Qi Shue).  

Martin soon finds himself entangled in a battle not only to save Lai, but also to help stop her father from selling a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.

Louis Leterrier, director of The Transporter 2, described his take of the upcoming action/adventure movie.  

"Frank Martin gave up on his old, former occupation transporting for the mafia, [and now] he just wants to have a straight life. [Martin] is the chauffeur for a kid and the kid gets kidnapped and he has to get the kid," Leterrier said.

Just by judging by the scene shot at FIU, The Transporter 2 looks like it's as intense as its predecessor.

 "A jet came down, and crashed down in the water. You see the interior of the jet with water [where] lead Jason Statham and Alessandro Gassman, one of the bad guys, battle," said Leterrier's assistant Pam Weiss, when asked why there was a piece of a jet in the pool.

 Shooting this one scene took about two-and-a-half hours, but Weiss said that the entire crew had to arrive on set at BBC at 6:30 a.m.

Why FIU? Why not somewhere in Hollywood, California?

"Because you see how big [the pool] is there. We needed the crane; we needed a place where you can put the crane and since people shot here before, the place is going to be friendly," Weiss said.

When asked the same question, Leterrier's response was just as pleasant.

"FIU had the biggest pool in the area," said Leterrier. "It was the first choice and it was the best choice."

Definition of "Art" (in the contemporary sense)

"An artist makes a painting by arranging lines and colors on a surface in some interesting way." 
				- The World of Art: World Book Encyclopedia ©1960

	This essay is a response to last night.  You see, as usual, a friendly get together with friends at an art opening turned into a broad and frustrated discussion about "art".  I enjoy the topic, but I myself have trouble putting my thoughts together on-the-spot.  So, let me take this opportunity to organize my thoughts about what "art" is to me and how it fits into the world as I know it.

	First, why do I say "art"?  Well, this means that I want to emphasize the broad sense of the word.  "Art" can span from movie-making to religous-celebration, from the art of professional wrestling to yoga.  Yes, this is very broad.  "Art" crosses the boundaries of all these occupations of life, so it resembles a philosophy.  And, while philosophy concentrates on consciousness of "reality", it grows from our emotions.  Thus, I believe our emotions, at whatever stage it is at, is the root of "art", perhaps the essence of all social functions.  Ask yourself: Why does the wrestler fly off the top rope?

"Perhaps all works of art function to some extent as avenues of personal expression for the artist."

	Self-expression is the key here, the proverbial keystone that is holding the arch of our "artworld" together.  This is just my opinion here.  But, you might ask:  Doesn't this apply to EVERTHING that we do?  Yup, it sure does.  My definition implies that everything we DO is "art", including everything we MAKE.  Before, we start heading into philosophical territory let us go back to last night at the exhibition, now that we have some idea of my definition of "art".

"For art continues to satisfy (1) our individual needs for personal expression, (2) our social needs for display, celebration, and communication, and (3) our physical needs for utilitarian structures and objects."

	So there I was, surrounded by the works of around 50 different artists, in a gallery that also operated as the artists' studios.  It was quite an ingenious and revealing environment.  I was excited to see all the work, the variety of styles and techniques and ideas.  And, I met up with my fellow artist-friend, whom I share very similar artistic tastes with.  He, then leads me to an exhibition room with works he described as somewhat upsetting.  Now, this is where I take a differing point of view with my friend and some of my close contemporaries.

Contempt and Love for the Artist

	As I examined closely the "upsetting" work, I noticed that it was not the subject of the work that was upsetting to my friend, but rather the context of the situation that was upsetting.  I can sympathize with these feelings.  What was happening kinda felt like jealousy and contempt.  My friend has been to some of Europe's finest galleries and museums, rooms filled with the world's finest pieces of art.  He himself believes that these pieces have earned their place in history as works of genius: they represent humanity at its apex.  So, you can imagine, when he comes to see this exhibit down here in Miami's design district, he is dumb-founded to see work hanging on the walls, just like the masters' works hang in the Louvre, that fail to match the gloriousness and profound catharsis of the world's finest.  Yes, I've felt this way too.  But, where my friend would feel contempt for the artist, for having failed to live up to, or at least try to match, the greatness of Dali, Picasso, or VanGogh for instance, I feel contempt for the industry.

"Art" as Industry

	My definition of "art" is not compatible with my view of modern society's definition of it, which is: limited self-expression, censored by society's fears and anxieties and bound to the fate of the established economic system.  Let's apply this definition to last night at the exhibition:  As I walk through the gallery admiring the "art" (no longer bothered by the frustrated, academic or technical level of achievement), I finally understand that the work presented before me is NOT a representation of the fundamental "desire" to glorify our masters/teachers, but the result of a self-expression that has been pressured and suffocated by the powers of social persuasion and market forces.  These factors are elements of the free-market system.  Still, the important element of emotional development exists, but atrophied by the wave of commercialism.  Ask yourself: Did these artists earn the priviledge of gallery space, or did they just pay for it?

Outsider Art/ Underground Art

	So, as I failed to eloquently describe my theory to my friend who, like other contemporaries of mine, was upset to see such unsatisfying work hanging on the walls like VanGogh does at the MET, and with price tags that compounded the frustration, continued to have dissapointments with the artist for having failed to properly represent the honorable integrity of a master.  We started to divert the discussion towards the characteristics of a "master", such as his (no talk of female artists) desires or psychological health.  We, then, talked about the dangers of "criminal" art (such as erotic art, black metal) and then we kinda landed into outsider art.  Now, I place importance here because it is part of my view of modern society's definition of art and it's illegitimate offspring which is underground/outsider art.  As I stress the importance of emotional development as the root of "art", modern society's art, which has restricted our emotional freedom, has given birth to an outcast artist who prides himself on isolation, alienation or, perhaps, self-destruction.  I myself now understand why I have contempt for the market driven world of art.  If the art industry continues in its direction, we will have many frustrated and marginalized artists, upset that the free-market society has slighted them.

	It's true that there are many wonderful stories in the art world, my friend mentioned how DaVinci developed from a troubled youth, Joe Coleman himself found fame through his over-compulsive and grotesque work.  But, I ask: What about that artist that never makes the books, magazines or even the gallery?  Does he/she not deserve to have a gallery show?  My belief is, since every human being has the desire for self-expression, everyone should be entitled to embody and assume the role of the "artist", to carry on that tradition which has sprung from the "masters", those who have inspired us and shown us that our emotions have no bounds!  We should not have contempt for the artist, but rather have great skepticism  for the system which casts a shadow on his/her canvas.

"My guiding assumption has been that works of art illuminate life as nothing else can."
