Just wanted to comment that, while Steve Perhla wrote a solid article, we should not overlook the accomplishments of our female athletes as well(Andrea Nagy for example). Maybe a follow up article?

Thanks!

Headline: Impunity and the July 13, 1994 Massacre

&nbsp;
Impunity and the July 13, 1994 Massacre 

impunity noun: freedom from punishment for something that has been done that is wrong or illegal. Ex: After seven years the men responsible for the murder of 41 men, women, and children continue to live their lives with complete impunity. 

Nine years ago this July 13 in the early morning hours forty one Cuban men, women, and children were massacred by agents of the Cuban government. Their names and ages were Leonardo Notario Góngora (27), Marta Tacoronte Vega (36), Caridad Leyva Tacoronte (36), Yausel Eugenio Pérez Tacoronte (11), Mayulis Méndez Tacoronte (17), Odalys Muñoz García (21), Pilar Almanza Romero (30), Yaser Perodín Almanza (11), Manuel Sánchez Callol (58), Juliana Enriquez Carrasana (23), Helen Martínez Enríquez (6 months), Reynaldo Marrero (45), Joel García Suárez (24), Juan Mario Gutiérrez García (10), Ernesto Alfonso Joureiro (25), Amado Gonzáles Raices (50), Lázaro Borges Priel (34), Liset Alvarez Guerra (24), Yisel Borges Alvarez (4), Guillermo Cruz Martínez (46), Fidelio Ramel Prieto-Hernández (51), Rosa María Alcalde Preig (47), Yaltamira Anaya Carrasco (22), José Carlos Nicole Anaya (3), María Carrasco Anaya (44), Julia Caridad Ruiz Blanco (35), Angel René Abreu Ruiz (3), Jorge Arquímides Lebrijio Flores (28), Eduardo Suárez Esquivel (39), Elicer Suárez Plascencia, Omar Rodríguez Suárez (33), Miralis Fernández Rodríguez (28), Cindy Rodríguez Fernández (2), José Gregorio Balmaceda Castillo (24), Rigoberto Feut Gonzáles (31), Midalis Sanabria Cabrera (19), and four others who could not be identified. 

This atrocity was sanctioned by the Cuban government, and the men responsible were decorated and given promotions. In this case as in so many others the Cuban government has acted with complete impunity. Their actions are the dictionary definition of impunity. 

The Cuban dictatorship is marching out of step with the rest of the civilized world. Dictators and democrats along with their henchmen all along the ideological spectrum have to take notice: 

·           Serbian tyrant Slobodan Milosevic stands trial before an international tribunal in The Hague for war crimes sent there by his fellow countrymen. 

·            Former Argentine President Carlos Menem has been indicted for allegedly heading an illicit organization that illegally sold rifles and artillery to Croatia in 1991 and Ecuador in 1995. ·  Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet was held under house arrest in Great Britain, and still faces prosecution back in Chile for his responsibility in the murder of Chilean citizens during his dictatorship. 

·            In Mexico, 102 men were detained in connection with the 1997 Chiapas massacre in which 45 people were killed. Of the 102 Mexicans officials and citizens detained, 37 have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment and 65, as of the year 2000, are still subject to criminal proceedings. 

·            Gerardo Hernandez, one of the Cuban spies responsible for the February 24, 1996 murders of Armando Alejandre Jr., Carlos Costa, Mario de la Peña, and Pablo Morales , was found guilty in a US Federal Court of conspiracy to commit murder. Throughout the entire world freedom from punishment otherwise known as impunity is coming under fire. 

These are all positive developments on behalf of the rule of law and steps towards more democratic societies. Unfortunately, state sanctioned murders still go unpunished and on the world stage largely ignored. We are approaching the ninth anniversary of a massacre that took place on July 13, 1994 off the Cuban coastline. 41 men, women, and children drowned by agents of the Cuban government. 

In October 1996 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States declared "the Cuban State is responsible for violating the right to life (Article 1 of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man) of the 41 people who were shipwrecked and perished as a result of the sinking of the tug "13 de Marzo", which events occurred seven miles off the Cuban coast on July 13, 1994 

In 1996, in the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions report to the 52nd Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights stated that he had transmitted allegations concerning the "13 de Marzo" massacre to the Cuban Government in expressing deep concern that he had not received a reply. The UN Special Rapporteur on Cuba, in his report to the UN General Assembly also expressed serious concern "about the fact that an event of this magnitude, in which 37 people died, has not been investigated." 

In December 1994, a woman who lost her daughter, her brother and two other relatives in the July 13, 1994 tugboat massacre made the following appeal: "This crime cannot remain unpunished. We who suffered their physical disappearance can only cry and be silent. We keep a vigil by their photos with Rapid Response standing by. We have been warned not to put at risk the safety of those who survived. Everything is clear, we have to keep quiet. But you who are free to shout to the world that incidents like this should not be repeated must not forget this massacre... We only ask for the remains of our loved ones and that justice is done for this horrendous crime." 

Some have argued that holding dictators accountable would discourage them from giving up power, but on the other hand holding them accountable would discourage tyrants from engaging in greater abuses. The dictator in Cuba has been turned into a pop icon visited by celebrities and politicians from around the world. He has never been held accountable for his crimes, and his henchmen until the spy trial had never paid a price for their crimes. Castro's pop icon status has dimmed with the latest rounds of executions, show trials, and imprisonment of human rights activists, independent journalists, independent librarians, and pro-democracy activists.

When heads of state or their henchmen realize that their decisions, if violating fundamental human rights and freedoms, would open them up to years in prison they'll think twice before sanctioning a massacre or taking part in one. That is why nine years after a massacre of 41 men, women, and children justice still cries out from the families of the victims and from a watery grave nearly seven miles away from Havana's harbor. 

That is why on July 10 at 12 noon at FIU main fountain at the UP campus we will be holding a nine minute moment of silence to demand justice for the victims.

State of the Nation

I'm still a bit disturbed by what happened this evening and I need someone to help me understand it all.   

Have you ever had one of those moments when you just didn't feel a part of the planet anymore?  Disconnected from humanity and the world around you?  Separated from "the norm"?  Like some alien visitor in your own home?  I've felt like that for the last few hours and it's unsettling.  Let me describe to you what set off those feelings.  

I'd had a long day at work rushing around to get everything in order before the three-day weekend and could finally pack up and head home at 7:30 p.m.  I was traveling east on 836 when about 1/2 mile from the ramp for 95 N, I saw a car stopped on the left shoulder of the highway.  There was no one behind me and I was already in the left lane so I pulled in front of the car to see if the person needed help.  I pulled the parking brake and grabbed my cell phone then got out of my car and walked back to the disabled car. 

In the front seat was an elderly man, noticeably shaken, looking blankly at me as I approached his window.  As I got closer, I noticed that his left rear tire had blown and he was stranded on the narrow shoulder of this busy freeway.  I asked him if he was okay.  He said he was.  Then I asked if he had a phone with which to call for help.  He did not.   This man, alone on a highway as the sun was going down, his car unable to move, was helpless.  

I suggested he turn on his hazard lights and put the trunk and hood of the car up so people could quickly recognize that the car was immovable.  I also told him it was dangerous for him to remain in his car but rather he should stand a few yards in front of it along the concrete retaining wall.  All the while I was on the phone with 911 trying to get help for this man, this gentle old man, somebody's father, somebody's son.  His thick German accent made what little English he spoke difficult to understand.  We quickly moved from trying to speak and understand each other to just me trying to comfort him with my eyes and he trying to show appreciation with his.  

The police assured me an officer was on the way and I gave my phone to the man, whose name I now knew was Leo, to make the phone calls necessary - first one to get a number for a towing company - at least I assume this is what transpired as the conversation was all in German.  Then he called the towing company but quickly realized he would be unable to explain where he was and what he needed.  He said "one moment please" to the person on the other end of the phone and handed the phone to me, smiling a bit in embarrassment at his inability to communicate.  I gave the information to the towing company and they said a driver would be there shortly.  

With the police and a tow truck in transit, I felt I could leave him.  I told him to stay out of the car and I wrote my cell number down for him, telling him to call me as soon as help arrived so I would know he was okay.  I felt guilty for leaving him, there alone on the highway with cars roaring past him, the brim of his Bobby Jones cap lifting off a bit at each gust.  But I felt I had done all I could and he would be okay.

I said goodbye to him, pointed to my phone as a reminder to call me, then walked to my car and got in.   I started the car and released the parking brake, glancing behind me to see if it was safe to pull out into traffic.  At that moment, a dark blue SUV passed by me, its horn screaming at me with the driver mouthing obscenities and giving me the one-finger salute as it sped by - all this in the 1.34 seconds it took for it to pass me.  

My initial response was to respond in kind but thankfully I'm a bit slow to react sometimes and the driver must have only gotten a quick glimpse at the befuddled look on my face.  I found a hole in the traffic and pulled out, finally heading home.  But I was sick to my stomach.  No longer worried about Leo or his car but about this woman, this beast, who had no other thought when seeing two cars standing still along the highway but to be angry and annoyed that she had to slow down and change lanes and might arrive home 3 seconds later than she had expected.  Did she think we had pulled over to have a social chat or to discuss politics or have an evening snack?   

As I drove, I had hopes of seeing her car pulled over along the side of the road, perhaps out of gas or better yet, pulled over for speeding.  But my own anger went away, slowly I must admit, and turned to sadness.  I felt sad for the world, and for all the Leo's, and all the children who are growing up now to be selfish and inconsiderate and uncaring towards others.  

I wondered how the woman in the SUV would have felt if Leo had been her father or husband or son.  But she'll never have the chance to entertain that thought because she took no time at all to find out what was happening - and rather than attempt to help, or at the very least stay out of the way, actually acted to aggravate the situation.  She'll never be able to reflect on her actions or to perhaps come to realize that she had been unkind.  That brief two second incident even caused me to rethink ever stopping to help another Leo because what difference could I make anyway?  

Two hours later, I was at home, comfortable and fed, catching up on my e:mails when my cell phone rang.  A woman with a thick German accent said her name was Marta, Leo's sister.  She told me how thankful they both were that I had helped him and had stayed with him a while to help keep him calm.  Their sister, Emma, had recently died and Leo had flown from Germany to attend the funeral and to help care for Marta who was an unable to leave her home due to disability.  The funeral had been held just hours earlier and Leo was on his way home, alone, from the gravesite, when the tire blew out.  

She said he had stayed later than the others because Emma was Leo's twin sister and he just couldn't bear to leave her yet, had to sit with her beside the grave for just a few more minutes, just a few more minutes to talk to this sister he hadn't seen in 20 years but loved so dearly.   I heard Leo in the background, in his husky but oddly tender voice, thanking me again and again both in English and German.

And now I know that I'll do it again for another Leo or Emma or even SUV woman.  When I can know I've provided a little comfort and concern to someone who needs my help, I don't mind being an alien here on my own planet.

&nbsp;
(For the record, this an informal letter not meant for any sort of publication.)

Dear Beacon staff,

I am a journalism major, and I want to know if your newspaper reflects the benefits of FIU's journalism courses, or if none of you have taken any. (I edit and write for my paper not having yet taken "basic reporting.")

I am aware that Mario Diament is a very accomplished journalist; I've not only heard of - and been vehemently impressed by - his work but met him myself, which in his case, is enough to reveal his extensive skills. In any case, I believe he has only (relatively) recently reached his position; thus he may not have had much influence on the journalism program yet. 

I'm just asking so that I can make a coherent decision when my time to transfer comes.

Thank you.

Headline: Nanita earns first-team All-Region baseball honors
Subheadline: Banks lands on second-team
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU junior center fielder Ricardo Nanita was one of 14 players to be named to the Rawlings/All-South Central Region Baseball Team announced June 10 by the American Baseball Coaches Association.

Junior pitcher Josh Banks joined Nanita on the All-Region team, landing on the second-team.

Nanita was instrumental in directing the Golden Panthers to a 36-23 record, leading the team in average (.388), homeruns (12), and RBI (52).

The left-handed Dominican Republic native was chosen in the 14th round by the Chicago White Sox in last month's Major League Baseball amateur draft.

Banks, a first-team All-Sun Belt Conference selection from Arnold, MD, led the Golden Panther pitching attack, going 8-3, while striking out 114 batters on only 105.1 innings.

As the 50th overall selection by the Toronto Blue Jays in last month's draft, Banks became the highest-ever pick for a Golden Panther baseball player.

The South-Central Region is comprised 33 teams from six different conferences. The six conferences represented are the Sunbelt, Southland, Southwest Athletic, Atlantic Sun, Western Athletic, and Conference USA.

Headline: Williams second assistant coach to depart since season's end
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Assistant men's basketball coach Lonnie Williams resigned last week after three seasons under head coach Donnie Marsh.

The move marked the second FIU assistant to leave the team since season's end, after Sergio Rouco accepted an assistant position at UTEP in April.

"We're looking for two new staff positions now," Marsh said.

Marsh added: "[Lonnie's] contract is not going to be renewed, and we wish him well in whatever direction he goes."

With the search for new assistants underway, rumors are swirling as to who will replace the departed coaches.

Among some of the noteworthy names floating around include former University of Miami assistant Jesus Labrada and Northwest Christian Academy's Anthony Pujols, but neither possibility has been suggested nor confirmed by Marsh.

"Right now we probably have 75 resumes and have received about 150 phone calls, and I'm looking at everything," Marsh said.

While replacement possibilities still remain unclear, Marsh did acknowledge the kind of coach he is looking for.

"I'm looking for someone with energy, someone with recruitment expertise, and  who can help our current guys get better," said Marsh.

But basketball knowledge and recruiting are not all Marsh is looking for in his next assistants.

Added Marsh: "I'm looking for someone who is passionate about FIU and wants to be here."

Headline: Commentary: FIU not without its share of success in pros
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
When I think of Florida colleges that filter athletes from high school to the next level, UM, FSU, and UF always come to mind. This is no coincidence, considering these schools are not only huge powerhouses within the state, but rank right up there with the best universities in the nation. When listing individual competitors who went on to professional stardom after playing for these universities, the names are mind-boggling.

Some UM names that might ring a bell include Michael Irvin, Ray Lewis, Warren Sapp, Edgerrin James, Jim Kelly, Vinny Testaverde, Bernie Kosar, Pat Burrell, Alex Fernandez, Greg Vaughn, Charles Johnson, and Aubrey Huff, just to name a few.

When I think of FSU, I think of Deion Sanders, Peter Warrick, Charlie Ward, Derrick Brooks, Warrick Dunn, Chris Weinke, J.D. Drew, Doug Mientkiewicz, and Sam Cassell.

The Gators that come to  mind are Emmitt Smith, Fred Taylor, Danny Wuerffel, Rex Grossman, Ike Hilliard, David Eckstein, and Mike Miller.

Even UCF produced the likes of Daunte Culpepper.

So where is FIU left within all this statewide star power?

Well believe it or not, the Golden Panthers have quietly had their fair share of success in the pros. Considering that FIU had no football program until last year, it's justified that there are no Golden Panthers roaming NFL stadiums on Sundays. And while it's no secret that FIU, while only 30 years old, is nowhere near the level of the "Big Three" Florida schools at producing professional athletes, there are some key Golden Panthers who have surfaced around some of the nation's most prominent sports leagues.

Of the three major sports (baseball, basketball, and soccer) besides football, here's how I rank the top five all-time greatest professional athletes ever to play at FIU:



1. Mike Lowell- Lowell, 29, who currently starts at third base for the Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball, is the most accomplished professional athlete ever to come out of FIU. Lowell, who graduated from FIU in 1997 was an academic All-American during his stint as a Golden Panther. He twice hit two homeruns in one inning while at FIU, and was a member of the National League's All-Star team last season, hitting .276, with 24 homeruns, and 92 RBI. Lowell, originally drafted by the New York Yankees in 1998, was traded to the Marlins in 1999. This year, Lowell is batting .291, leads the Major Leagues with 23 homeruns, and already has 61 RBI through only 73 games. Lowell is arguably the best third baseman in Major League Baseball, and will soon make his second straight All-Star appearance.



2. Steve Ralston- Ralston, 29, now a midfielder for Major League Soccer's New England Revolution, is MLS's all-time leader in games played (177) and minutes played (15,500) entering the 2002 season. As a member of the FIU soccer team in 1994, Ralston led the nation in scoring (56 points) and assists (18). Ralston, who was MLS's first-ever Rookie of the Year in 1996, spent his first six seasons as a member of the Tampa Bay Mutiny, before being selected by the Revolution with the sixth overall pick in the MLS Allocation/Dispersal Draft in 2002. He was named the Mutiny's team MVP in 2001, and led the league in assists (18) in 1999. Ralston has also played as a member of the U.S. National Team six times, most recently as a starter against Ireland in 2000.



3. Raja Bell- Bell, 26, started 32 games for the NBA's Dallas Mavericks this season, helping the team to a 60-22 regular season record, tied for best in the league with the champion San Antonio Spurs. He graduated from FIU in 1999 after leading the Golden Panthers in scoring his junior and senior seasons. Bell, known as a defensive specialist in the NBA, is especially remembered for his tough defense as a rookie with the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2000-01 playoffs, being used by coach Larry Brown to guard Milwaukee's Ray Allen and then Los Angeles' Kobe Bryant in the NBA Finals. Bell averaged 3.1 points, and 1.9 rebounds per game, shooting 44 percent from the field as a part-time starter this season. Bell was an instrumental factor in Game Four, in the second round of the 2003 Western Conference Playoffs against the Sacramento Kings, scoring nine of his 13 points during a decisive third quarter run, helping the Mavericks advance to the Western Conference Finals.



4. Tyrone Marshall- Marshall, 28,  is a midfielder for MLS's Los Angeles Galaxy, as well as a member of the "Reggae Boyz", Jamaica's national team. He scored 22 goals and tallied 15 assists as a member of the FIU soccer team during the 1996-97 season, leading the team to the NCAA Final Four in 1996, scoring on a bicycle kick against UNC-Charlotte in the semi-final game. Marshall was selected in the first round of the 1998 MLS College Draft by the Colorado Rapids. He played for the Miami Fusion from 1998 to 2001, before being selected by the Galaxy with the ninth overall pick in the MLS Allocation/Dispersal Draft in 2002. Marshall was a key contributor to the Fusion's league best 16-5-5 record in 2001, and scored the game-winning goal in a World Cup qualifying match against Trinidad and Tobago in February of 2001.



5. Carlos Arroyo- Arroyo, 23, is a point guard for the NBA's Utah Jazz and served as one of NBA legend John Stockton's backups during the 2002-03 season. Arroyo, who graduated from FIU in 2001, became only the fifth Puerto Rican player to play in the NBA when he debuted for the Toronto Raptors in 2001, after playing professionally in Spain in 2000-01. He also played as a member of the Denver Nuggets during the 2001-02 season. Arroyo scored a career high 16 points for Utah against Golden State in April 2003, and averaged 2.9 points and 1.9 assists during the 2002-03 campaign. As a member of the Golden Panthers in 1999-00, Arroyo averaged a team-high 17.7 points per game and set a FIU single-season record with 135 assists. With the retirement of Stockton in Utah, Arroyo could see a significant increase in playing time with the Jazz this season.

Headline: Commentary: With FIU athletic season over, let's review, shall we?
Author: Mike Hernandez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU athletics received more media attention during the 2002-03 academic year than ever before and much of that credit belongs to the addition of its Division I-AA football program.

The New York Times did a feature on head football coach Don Strock and his attempt to build the program. The Miami Herald and Sun-Sentinel each began weekly coverage of FIU's team and even wrote features. 

Although this may seem like the coverage FIU should be receiving, it's really not. 

Until football came along, FIU was just a commuter school in Miami without an athletic identity. 

Football clearly stole the spotlight and seemed like the only sport that had any community support. 

But it seems that we forgot the other sports at FIU this year..

With football overshadowing the Golden Panther sports scene, I think there's a need to review the overall sports picture at FIU. 

Keeping that in mind, let's take a look at my picks for the worst and best of the 2002-03 FIU sports season. 



Biggest disappointment



Without a doubt, the failure of the baseball team to make the regional is the most disappointing, and unexpected, development of the year. 

The team had a string of six consecutive seasons of regional appearances. The program, by far one of FIU's most respected, finished the 2003 campaign 36-23, falling four wins shy of the important number 40 for consideration to be invited to the NCAA Tournament. 

The team also failed to win the Sun Belt Conference which would have given them an automatic bid.

However, FIU was well represented in the Major League Baseball Amateur Draft two weeks ago. Junior pitcher Josh Banks, a native of Arnold, Maryland, became the highest selected Golden Panther in history. He was drafted 50th overall by the Toronto Bluejays. 

Three other players - Arthur Santos, Andrew Edwards and Ricardo Nanita all were selected in the later rounds as well. 

Additionally, two of the programs prized high school recruits were selected. Sean Rodriguez from Braddock High School and Robert Valido of Coral Park were taken with the 90th and 112th picks respectively.

With all the obvious talent the Golden Panthers boasted this season, the question  being asked is - why the subpar finish? You can only blame injuries for so much. This is one talented baseball team that should be competing with the best in the country year in and year out. 

With the departure of the four drafted players and the more than likely loss of recruits Rodriguez and Valido to go along with the seven senior graduates, how will FIU perform next season? 

Head coach Danny Price definitely has his work cut out.



Biggest surprise



During their fifth season of existence, the softball team advanced to the conference title game before falling to the Ragin' Cajuns of Louisiana-Lafayette. 

The Golden Panthers did receive an at-large bid into the tournament and was invited to the regional in Lincoln, Nebraska before being ousted on the first day of competition.

Coach Kim Gwydir does have alot to build on as her team continues to push for improvement.



Biggest question mark ?



You would think that winning the Atlantic Soccer Conference and being the only team in the athletic program to win an NCAA tournament match up would have your team placed on a pedestal throughout the school. 

Not at FIU. 

Men's soccer had little  fan support throughout the season and that generated one of the largest losses in revenue for the athletic department. 

After cutting the program for a week, the team was reinstated for two more seasons with the understanding that they must raise more money to remain intact.

Perhaps the most daunting task for the coaching staff will be convincing recruits to sign with the team when they can't guarantee there will be a team two seasons from now.



The immediate future of the program



OK. Let's face it. FIU is NOT UM. I hear the comparison being drawn all too often. Not only is it moronic and stupid to compare the two, it's a disservice to the athletic department. 

FIU is at best a mid major. UM is one of the top athletic programs in the three major sports - football, basketball and baseball - in the country.

Additionally, UM is currently in its 77th year of operation. FIU just turned 30 years old.

The Golden Panthers compete in the Sun Belt Conference, which receives little attention from NCAA loyalists while the Hurricanes currently compete in the Big East and more than likely will spearhead the defections of Boston College and Syracuse to the ACC.

UM has five national championships in football alone. Add four from baseball and you already have nine national titles in just two men's sports. 

FIU has two national championships in Division II both coming from Men's soccer. The Golden Panthers cheerleading squad was crowned the best in the land three years ago.

What does this all tell you? 

Don't compare the two programs. It's not possible. 

FIU's athletic administration needs to aim to build itself up along the lines of in-state schools such as the University of South Florida and University of Central Florida. These programs have competitive athletic teams and know where they stand in the college sports world. 

FIU seems to be aiming too high too fast. As the old saying goes, Rome was not built in a day. 

The key sports to promote are football, baseball, women's basketball and softball. Not only are these FIU's top programs, they also demand the most fan interest in Florida.

Maybe someday FIU will be able to compare itself to UM. But not yet or anytime soon.

Headline: Surgeon General's tobacco ban comment would strip states of revenue
Author: Tommy Payne, Los Angeles Times
&nbsp;
Surgeon General Richard Carmona uncorked a genie's bottle of political hypocrisy with his  comment before Congress that he would support banning tobacco products. 

Why didn't such a bold, sincerely delivered statement, from the nation's top physician, win him any measurable praise from the anti-smoking lobby and politicians who have long decried smoking? The answer may lie in that famous piece of advice: "Follow the money.'' 

Carmona, perhaps unintentionally, revealed the ultimate game of wanting to have it both ways. The government is "addicted'' to tobacco revenue. 

Between 1998 and 2002, state, federal and local government collected nearly $135 billion from U.S. smokers, who, according to our data, have a median annual household income of about $35,000. 

Government pockets more tobacco revenue per minute than the average family brings home in a year. 

About 47 percent of the cost of an average pack of cigarettes goes to government. In contrast, my company, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, makes a profit per pack of about 3 percent. 

State governments are particularly dependent upon cigarette funding. If the surgeon general were to get his wish, California would stand to lose $2.3 billion annually. New York would be out $2.1 billion. Texas would fall short by $1.7 billion and Michigan more than $1 billion. 

In 2002, 44 states faced budget deficits. Twenty of them increased cigarette taxes to help make up the difference. 

It's a good thing that a suggestion that amounts to a ban on this revenue stream came from a physician. A number of state governors might need CPR if told they'd lost state tobacco revenues. 

Ironically, even the anti-smoking lobby didn't warm up to the concept of banning cigarettes. Perhaps that's not as surprising as it might seem. Revenues from taxes and the Master Settlement Agreement between the states and major cigarette manufacturers have provided more than $2 billion in funding for youth nonsmoking programs and other tobacco-control activities.

Is it realistic to believe that more than 40 million Americans would just quit smoking? The black market created by such a move would make "The Sopranos'' look like a bunch of choirboys. 

So, in supporting the abolition of the government's golden goose, did Carmona lay an egg? Perhaps not. He deserves credit for raising an intellectually honest question: Should cigarettes remain legal for adults in this country? If so, should they be manufactured and sold by a government monopoly, as in some nations, or by private enterprise? And if it's to be private enterprise, how should the manufacture and sale of a product with known health risks be regulated? 

There are reasonable regulations that could be placed on U.S. cigarette manufacturers, in addition to those already in force, that would serve the public interest - for example, uniform good manufacturing practices, consistent standards for ingredients and their disclosure, and rules for communicating tar and nicotine yields. 

But reasonable federal regulation should not include restrictions that restrain legitimate competition between manufacturers for adult smokers' business, nor should it lead to de facto prohibition by requiring that cigarettes be made in such a way that they become unpalatable to the adults who choose to smoke them.

Subheadline: ISSS 'deserves more credit than criticism'
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

I wish to thank you for putting a spotlight on the International Student & Scholar Services office a few weeks earlier. Though the article reflected the difficulties faced by students in getting good service, I wish to make the following observations.

FIU has a total of 3,741 international students. That's approximately 11 percent of the total student population. 

It's really a pity that FIU has not done much to ameliorate the overworked, under-appreciated, often criticized staff at the ISSS office. There are only three advisors at the ISSS office who are eligible to advise international students at FIU (as per new regulations of Department of Security). There's no doubt that they are continuing to do a tremendous job with such limited resources. 

The current office is so small and cramped that even five students at the desk seem an impending stampede. It's high time that the FIU administration takes note of the plight of ISSS office, provides them with a well-deserved much larger office space through the new GC expansion plan. 

The support staff in the ISSS office totals only three, one of who is the SEVIS coordinator, a part time program assistant and a secretary. Besides them, a few student assistants (three undergraduate assistants and two graduate assistants) are doing their best to serve the students.

Despite all these limitations, I believe the ISSS staff has continued to provide outstanding service to the ever-growing international student population. I certainly believe that the ISSS office deserves more credit than criticism as it always does. 

As an international student, my biggest draw to FIU is the incredible diversity of student population. In order to make FIU really "international" the focal point of any change would be to help the ISSS office serve the students more effectively.

I hope all international students understand and appreciate the constraints under which the ISSS operates. 

Hopefully, FIU reaches out to expand the ISSS office, brings in more advisors and helps the ISSS to serve the students even better. Until then we all have to be patient.

Headline: Media caters to right wing, favorably portrays war
Author: Andy Diaz, Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
"Pisces mortui solum cum flumine natant."

"Only dead fish go with the flow."

About nine months ago, I attended a lecture by an editor of the Israeli, English-language, right wing newspaper, The Jerusalem Post, who sold himself as a journalist but was nothing more than a shameless propagandist for the Likudite philosophy. 

The discussion which couldn't have been further from its advertised purpose, "an up-to-date view on how the United States, Israel and the Palestinian authority are looking at the current situation," was a battle hymn for our republic for the ineluctable war on Iraq, a deafening beat upon the war drums drowning out all dissent with the same repetitive rhetoric grounded on what we now know is, well, groundless information. 

The conclusion drawn was this: Saddam Hussein is an uncontrollable, uncontainable mad man and his large arsenals of weapons of mass destruction make him an incipient storm in the calm waters of the democratic water world - glory, glory, hallelujah.  

In our neck of the woods, the journalism cum propaganda was eerily similar. The credulous pundits on the primetime political talk shows ranted and raved about the dangers of Saddam Hussein and the resolve of President Bush and his coalition of the "who?" to get the Butcher of Baghdad for all his nefarious intentions without ever offering a comprehensive dissenting voice or giving those who advocated anything else but war equal airtime. 

Vanity Fair's columnist Christopher Hitchens,  usually a very sensible political gadfly, appeared regularly on "Hardball with Chris Matthews,"  along with professional Bushite cheerleader, the prissy Howard Fineman from Newsweek, to square off with innocuous, unseasoned anti-war debaters some of whom were members of grassroots college organizations. Where were the great anti-war debaters? Gore Vidal, Noam Chomsky, Norman Mailer? There was no time allotted for them in the American media.

Perhaps the best example of the impunity card given to the Bush administration by the press came on March 6 when Bush gave his last press conference before the start of the war. Vanity Fair writer, James Wolcott, who made the journalistic sham the center of his June column, described it in this fashion: "It was a solemn, hollow piece of absurdist theater. Members of the press were marched into the room two by two, like schoolchildren on a field trip to the planetarium. Departing from precedent, the president refused to entertain a random volley of questions; instead, he chose reporters from a prepared list, the resulting colloquy so stilted that [Bush] couldn't resist blurting out at one embarrassing juncture that the entire evening was 'scripted.'"

Now,  two months after President Bush declared the major fighting in Iraq over - more than one soldier a day has died in the two months since, the administration can't seem to find their main reason for going to war, Saddam's WMD arsenals. This smoking gun, which according to Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell and the rest of the motley crew, would be fairly easy to find once 150,000 American soldiers carried out the war, or as the more witty internet-spamming humorists have been calling it, "Dubya Dubya II," is now nowhere to be found. 

In a delightfully ironic twist, the military inspectors who prowl Iraq for the chemical and biological weapons, or anything resembling it, are asking for the same thing, although carefully skirting the phrase, Hans Blix and the United Nations inspectors asked for before the war: more time.

However, the Bush administration being led into war by poor intelligence - what a wonderful pun - is not mainly to blame for their fruitless adventure. More culpable are the media cheerleaders who happily went along with it and didn't think to question the administration's information or motives. Upon closer inspection, any savvy reporter would have arrived at the obvious decision that Saddam Hussein posed no more of a threat than any one of the slew of totalitarian dictators who still infect the modern world. Iraq, after all, spent one tenth of what its southern neighbor, Kuwait, does on defense, yet has a population three times as large. 

We chose to overlook facts such as this, and turned a deaf ear to Iraq's neighbors, who were the first targets of Saddam's temper tantrums and land-grabbing hunger, yet opposed the war because they realized that Hussein posed no real threat to them at all.

Eventually, the dust will settle and we will realize how unjust this war has been. We will realize that Saddam Hussein posed no real threat at all, to his neighbors or to us. 

Once that happens, the same media pundits who cheered the administration on will criticize it, as is already starting to happen.

Headline: In need of a prayer: Roadmap to peace
Author: Nicholas Yaciuk, Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Peace in the Middle East; No one I know actually sees this as a reality anytime soon. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be attempted, and the Bush administration has taken up the cause as yet another in a string of foreign plans to make the world safe for liberal democracy, and to attempt to end violence in yet another area of the world. 

Afghanistan and Iraq down, Israel to go. Of course, Afghanistan isn't completed yet, and Iraq is going to be a foreseeable area of American involvement for years to come. But this has not dissuaded the administration from getting involved in a crisis that has been around for over 50 years.

 The administration most notably, Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell, and Cheney, haven't been known for their diplomatic abilities in solving past crises, so one must wonder how successful they will be in their attempts to put into practice the newest plan to create a reconciliation between the Israelis and Palestinians. After all, if this plan doesn't go over as intended, the troops will most likely not be able to be called out to solve yet another mess that America's prestige has been dragged into. And God forbid if it is, a hellish scenario of continuous conflict can be argued much more realistically then was predicted to occur in Iraq.

But let's look at the proposed Bush plan that has been accepted by the United Nations, the European Union, and Russia. The 'roadmap' as it has been dubbed, according to the state department, consists of a three-phase process. But I'm just going to look at Phase I, entitled 'Ending Terror and Violence, Normalizing Palestinian Lives, and Building Palestinian Institutions.' It seems to be a remarkable, ordered, and step-by-step process that looks great on paper. Of course, foreign policy initiatives have historically looked viable until they have had to be put into practice. 

This plan calls for an end to terror violence and formal declarations against such attacks, as well as real efforts to arrest and detain individuals that threaten or carry out these attacks. This will require an effective Palestinian leadership with solid influence and control over terror organizations, such as Hamas. But whether or not this is even possible is a real problem. The newly elected Prime Minister Abbas has yet to prove the ability to control or simply influence  the portion of the Palestinian population that has taken a militant stance towards Israeli existence.

The second part of this first phase in the roadmap deals with normalizing, or stabilizing, the Palestinian people's lives. This is an ambiguous goal, at best. How long does population normalization take, and what exactly is meant by this statement? It seems to be just another open-ended policy statement intended to sound reasonable without saying anything at all. But I'll take a stab at it. 

 The statement presumes that after a period of ceasefire, and relative peace, the Palestinian people will grow into a routine of nonviolent interaction with Israelis as they wait for the 2005 date of independent statehood. This supposes that the people will accept the agreement and the terms of statehood, ignoring the status quo of retaliation after retaliation. Let us pretend that the newly elected Prime Minister has the clout to control the militant portion of the population. What kind of normalization can be achieved in the limbo of waiting for a complete change in lifestyle, recognition, and government participation? 

The last point in the first phase is the building of Palestinian institutions. America is getting a lot of practice in this area lately, and in countries much larger than the proposed size of the new Palestinian state. If there is anything that the Bush administration must have learned in the past year, it is that institution building is easier said than done. President Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan can't take a step outside of Kabul without American G.I. bodyguards, and he is still getting shot at. Assassinations are almost commonplace, and the threat of state destruction looms around every corner from internal dissidents. In Iraq the only semblance of order is the ubiquitous presence of American soldiers in fatigues, and that probably will remain the only hope of consistency for many years to come. So with this in mind, the only hope for stable Palestinian political organization seems to be little more than a pipe dream for now.

All I can say is Phase I of the roadmap is in desperate need of prayer, and that is one thing the Middle East has plenty of. The only question is which god do you pray to?

Headline: FCC rules change will have drastic consequences
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
If the Federal Communications Commission has their way, media companies would be able to reach 45 percent of the national market - up from 35 - and own television stations while simultaneously owning newspapers, and radio stations.  They would also be able to own several stations, newspapers, and cable outlets in a single market.

The proposed rule change, might kick off the elimination of variety in media similar to the power-grab that resulted after radio was deregulated in 1996 - at present, Clear Channel Communications owns over 1,200 radio stations in the United States, including a controlling stake in the Miami area.

Luckily, the change is facing some fire from members of Congress, including Sen. John McCain, who resides as chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Rep. Trent Lott - strangely, both Republicans - as well as many Democrats.

A bizarre mix of special interest groups have also chimed in opposing the change, including the National Rifle Association and the National Organization for Women.  When has the NRA and NOW ever agreed on anything?  

That's probably a pretty sure indicator that something is very wrong with this idea.  By allowing a large media conglomerate, such as AOL Time Warner or NewsCorp, to come into a market and further buy out media outlets of all types eliminates the smaller players.  Even Ted Turner, who merged his CNN into the AOL Time Warner conglomeration had reservations.  He warned in the Washington Post, "When you lose small business, you lose big ideas."

Hear that Congress?

Headline: Movie inspires professor's research
Author: Marjorie Rizzo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
John Zdanowicz is proving that going to the movies can be entertaining and enlightening.

Zdanowicz, a professor of finance in the university's College of Business Administration, was inspired by the 2002 terrorism-based movie, "The Sum of All Fears" and recently published research on the detection of abnormal weight in U.S. international trade.

"The Sum of all Fears" is based on a novel by Tom Clancy, and in the film a CIA agent must stop a group of European neo-Nazi terrorists from bombing the Super Bowl.

 In the film, an atomic bomb is encased in a vending machine by terrorists, and this is when movie watcher Zdanowicz told himself: "That vending machine had to have weighed a hell of a lot more than a regular vending machine; how come no one was monitoring weight?" 

And from there he decided to begin a new research project slightly different than his previous data analyses which focused more on issues dealing with finance, pricing and money laundering. 

This new computer analysis allowed Zdanowicz and his colleague Professor Donald Chambers of Lafayette College, to determine the normal weight characteristics for every product imported into the United States. That enabled the duo to compare the weight of every imported product to the range and to sort out all the transactions with abnormal weight.

"The analysis strips out items that are overweight and underweight, and the government can follow up on why the weight is abnormal," Zdanowicz said.

Weight can be under or over weight for various reasons, including drug smuggling and money laundering.

"Perhaps the greatest value of this data is that government agents can use it to determine which items should be inspected by [the office of] Homeland Security," Zdanowicz said. 

He has also published the first of a series of articles regarding his research in the May 2003 issue of Money Laundering Alert. The article mentions how his research is expanding to analyze abnormal weight of not only U.S. imports, but exports as well.

Zdanowicz' colleagues consider his research an important asset.

"Dr. Zdanowicz and his colleague Donald Chambers have broken new ground in the identification of trade patterns that fall outside normal parameters, and [their research] can be used in a number of ways," William Welch, associate professor of Finance, said.

"John's research into international trade transactions, has yielded results of significant interest not only in the academic community but also among legislators and regulatory agencies," Sally Gallion, assistant dean for the College of Business Administration said.

Gallion also said she feels research like Zdanowicz' has more potential than some are able to see.

"Our faculty's research isn't simply an intellectual exercise; it has the potential to serve the common good," Gallion said.

Not only did Professor Fain and 16 Honors College students act as tourists in the nation's capitol last month, they also had the chance to be seen on international television.  On a recent trip to Washington D.C., Fain and his students were audience members for the popular CNN political television show "Crossfire."  

The class trip was organized to allow the students to experience what they learned in Fain's third year Honors class, The American Character.  By visiting the Library of Congress, the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, and the "Crossfire" set, the students got to witness first hand some of the democracy and symbolism of American culture.      

Fain's goal was for his students to learn the value and importance of positive criticism "grounded in knowledge, guided by principles, and driven by passion." 

 Overall the trip was seen as a successful and memorable trip. 

"Trips like this are what make a college education not just good, but extraordinary,"  Karen Quinones, an Honors College student, said.

Headline: Study abroad participation wanes; economy may be to blame
Author: Anthony Metzelar, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Study Abroad Programs at FIU have been negatively impacted by the economic instability of the country and a few other factors brought about by recent world events.  

According to Ruthann Williams, the director and marketing coordinator of the Study Abroad Programs, the poor economy causes students to be leery of leaving a job for too long in order to participate in the program.  This is especially a problem when a parent is out of work and the student has to contribute to the household, creating another reason not to participate in the program.  

A secondary factor is the fear of travel, or at least parents' fear of their children traveling.  

"We suspect that the war in Iraq may have caused some parents to prohibit their students from participating in a study abroad program," Williams said.  

Still, Williams also added that preliminarily, her department feels that the numbers are down solely due to the economy.  

"Most directors feel the war was not to blame, but the economy was," Williams said. "FIU is a commuter school and a lot of students live at home and contribute to the household."

 Philip Church, assistant professor in the Theatre department, shares a similar opinion.  According to Church, these programs are 90 percent dependent upon parent support.  
"I don't know how many full-time students come up with the kind of money most study abroad programs have to ask, and these at FIU are definitely bargain basement deals!" Church said.  

Church, whose course in the birth and burial place of Shakespeare offers students the chance to travel with the Study Abroad Program, says that the fear of flying may not be as big a factor as the economic considerations and, "fortunately, there are opportunities for students to receive scholarships or student aid." 

The Study Abroad Programs require travel mainly during the summer and are conducted by FIU faculty members who travel with a group of students.  Students register for the program as they would a class at FIU, and are allowed to use financial aid to cover costs. 

 "This year, our office implemented a new scholarship to help students who want to participate, but are in need of some financial aid," Laura Cronin, coordinator of Student Affairs said. 

Douglas Kinkaid, the vice provost of the International Studies department, created the new scholarship of $300 - $500 per student. 

"Maybe a student couldn't otherwise go, and can use help.  This [scholarship] could be the determining factor," Williams said.

  The International Exchange Program provides for student travel during the fall and spring semesters.  Due to an agreement between FIU and other universities worldwide, this program allows students to go abroad and take classes at another university while paying FIU tuition.  As in the Shakespeare study abroad program, students register for credits at home, so they may use their financial aid. 

To participate in this program, students need to be fluent in the language of the host country because they will join native students in classes.  Still, students say that the experience is well worth the work. 

"This is a hands-on business, cultural, and educational experience," said Carl Bergstrom, a management and entrepreneurship major who took courses in Bulgaria last year.

  Graduate student Marlene Taylor, who traveled abroad in summer 2000, said study abroad programs give students valuable insight and knowledge that cannot be found in a classroom, and experiencing another culture up close and personal helps students gain a greater appreciation for diversity.  

"I think the Czech study abroad program was one of the best experiences I have ever had," Taylor said. "I feel that the program has contributed to my success on both a professional and personal level."

Despite this positive feedback, the numbers of students registering for the program continues to decrease. 

"Some trips have left to Spain with only six students," Williams said.  

There are 38 programs for the year, and eight have already cancelled, three of which were to China (which may be attributed to the problems with SARS that the country is currently experiencing.)
But Church says these programs should be kept alive.

"Actually, what we need are one or two major corporations to step up to the plate and begin to create a scholarship fund to help young people in the future," Church said. These programs cannot grow cheaper as we move forward.  I cannot stress how much these trips and the educational experience of subject and travel have transformed so many young lives." 

Church added that any halfway respectable school should have a fully functioning, active, and accessible study abroad program.

"Our fear is that once they disappear, the energy may not be there to resurrect them again, and that would be a terrible loss to an international university," Church said.

For more information on the new study abroad scholarship or to check on the full list of program offerings for summer 2003, students can visit the web site at http://ois.fiu.edu. 
For details about a program, Williams suggests that students consult with the particular program's director.

Headline: School of Nursing enacts initiatives to increase asthma awareness in community, aid minorities
Author: Jennifer Sittig, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Community. Cultural diversity. Prevention. These are some of the ideas involved in the two new iniatives the FIU School of Nursing   has implemented.

The Center for Leadership in Pediatric and Family Nursing's first initiative focuses on outreach and exposure of nursing students to diverse practice sites. The second initiative, "Healthy Children, Healthy Homes" is an asthma awareness program. 

Headed by Dr. Sandra Lobar, associate professor of nursing, the CLPFN initiative aims to prepare nurse leaders at FIU to meet the health care needs of culturally diverse groups of children and families.  The nurse leaders will work in multidisciplinary groups with health care agencies and apply research to nursing practices.  

The initiative includes a two-course MCH leadership series focusing on minority children and their families as well as two workshops for the larger community that will take place annually, among other activities. Health Recourses and Services Administration, a government grant program, will fund the initiative. The project period is from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2008.  

"Our goal is to expose students to diverse practice and clinical sites," said Lobar. "Through community partnerships they will gain nursing leadership and organizational skills." 

"Healthy Children, Healthy Homes," headed by Dr. Dorothy Brooten and Dr. Joanne Youngblut, is an asthma awareness program. The focus of this initiative is to educate parents and families, centering on Hispanic households, where the number of incidences of asthma are high, regarding how household management of environmental factors can play a role in asthma prevention. The project and planning phase began last August and will commence this September, when a new phase will begin.

"We expect 'Healthy Children, Healthy Homes' to provide us important new insights into how nurses can help parents and the community realize the benefits of prevention in improving the quality of life for children with asthma and reduce its economic impact on individuals and society," said Brooten.

Partnering with FIU to promote the initiative are SC Johnson Wax, RTI International, Winn Dixie, Zubi Advertising, and "Asthma Amigos," a parent volunteer organization, amongst others. 

"We want to make the community more aware of the simple things to do on how to minimize triggers of asthma," Project Director Jennifer Hererra said.

Herrera listed a few preventive measures for triggering asthma: keeping a clean house, removing dust, ridding spaces of roaches and steering clear of pet dander and cigarette smoke.  

The community-based education campaign started at the Corpus Christi School and Parish in the Wynwood community of Miami.  The initiative held a children's seminar, poster contest and an on-site asthma screening at the school and at four area Winn-Dixie stores.  The results from the screening will be available fall 2003.  

"We and our partners' goal is to take this pilot study nationwide," Herrera said.

The School of Nursing's two new initiatives intend to benefit and provide community outreach for the South Florida area.

"Nurses are a key point-of-contact for patients and their families.  An important nursing function is to help people understand and control factors affecting their health," said Dr. Brooten.

Kaito, Band Red, 3 1/2 stars

The difference between music and sheer noise is huge. It should be distinguishable to most human ears, even though many of the "top" bands are just noise, but lets not dive into that. 

Now, what happens when a band of talented musicians gets together and decides it's going to make noise, pretty awful noise too, but shape it into something that's actually fun to listen to?  You get a band like Kaito.

The rock quartet from the UK is at its, what's been called, "noise-pop" antics again with their second LP, Band Red. Who would've thought that noise could be so much fun?  

Think Le Tigre, only not as angry and twice as pulsating. I found it hard to do anything else besides shake my head when listening to this album. Its well-placed psychotic repetition is only matched by its incredibly energetic nature.

 Band Red is also full of all different kinds of barely audible spunk. That's right, half the time you can't really understand what lead singer and guitarist Niki Colk is saying. 

They must have put her voice through the same FX filter for each and every track on this album. Don't get me wrong, it's a very nice effect, it just drowns out her words a little. 

This seems to be the type of sound Kaito is striving to achieve though, so one must not see it as much of a flaw, although you are missing some very well-written lyrics; flip through the insert if you get a chance.

I can imagine hearing this music in one of those trendy indie-pop clubs. The sound is just insanely addictive and really fun to dance to. Yes, I've tried. Shut up. 

There's not much else I can say about Band Red. Its just piercing quality is simply pure and undeniable fun. Just make sure to turn down the treble a bit on your stereo.

Brand New, Deja Entendau, 4 stars

I have been anticipating the new Brand New record for months and found myself feeling slightly nervous; wondering if it would live up to its hype as I put the CD in for the first time. Deja Entendu opens with "Tautou," a short intro track with haunting melodies and crashing cymbals. Brand New has also been opening their live set with this song. The first actual track on the album, "Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades," stands out as one of the catchiest songs offered on this, short, eleven track album. 

The lyrics, coupled with a really sexy bass line, create an addictive and seductive aura, "The fever, the focus, the reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell/Die young and save yourself/The tickle, the taste of it used to be the reason I breathed but now it's choking me up." 

Deja Entendu is a big step forward from their previous 2001 offering, Your Favorite Weapon. The guys leave behind most of the ultra-catchy, pop-punk hooks and lyrics to experiment with melodies and words that aren't as easily digested. Regardless, Brand New is still Brand New. Lead singer Jesse Lacey's lyrics are perpetually clever and brutally honest, as always, laced with subtle threats and acidic warning. 

You can hear some of their influences filter through in such songs as "The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot," very reminiscent of Coldplay and The Smiths, or "Play Crack The Sky," somewhat suggestive of Bright Eyes. While they have strayed from easy familiarity and experimented with different styles, this album flows smoothly from one song to the next and there is no mistaking who you're listening to. Track five, "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows," is another noteworthy song, with a super-catchy chorus and melody. It's actually still in my head right now! 

Brand New have always stood out as one of the leaders in their large and varied genre some call pop-punk. "We are entirely smooth. Yes we admit to the truth - we are the best at what we do." They've become masters at creating music you love to listen to without being trite and overdone.

The album closes like Your Favorite Weapon with a stunning ballad. "Play Crack The Sky" is a beautiful account of drowning in hopelessness, without a life-jacket or anyone to pull you out. "I wish for one more day to give my love and repay debts/But the morning finds our bodies washed up thirty miles west."

So did the album live up to my expectations? Absolutely. I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it on Tuesday. It's easily the best emo (dare I use that term?) record of 2003 to date. 

I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the band, the genre or just music in general. You won't regret it.

The Gossip, Movement, 3 stars

The Gossip have recorded vocals in the bathroom, love Justin Timberlake and insist that "if ur not gonna dance, just stay at home" on their website. The Arkansas-raised, Washington-based trio's second full-length album, Movement, is raw-sounding rock in the riot grrl vein, but its blues mentality sets it apart. 

Although most tracks barely hit the three-minute mark, they swagger out of your speakers, each one a short burst of in-your-face, get-up-and-move sound. 

Beth Ditto's vocals have all the power and panache of Corin Tucker's (of label-mates Sleater-Kinney) with a dash of Etta James. She's confident but never pretentious, making your lip curl playfully into an Elvis sneer as you sing along. "Now that you got me/ What are you gonna do to keep me?" she teases on "Dangerer," her voice cracking and rasping with all the passion of Janis Joplin. 

On "Lesson Learned," Ditto ridicules trend junkies, mocking "Now you buy the right records/Now you got the right shoes/Yeah you look so good/But that's all you do." 

She can lapse into narcissism, though: On the secret track, Ditto seems entranced by the sound of her own voice, stretching syllables until they nearly break. Generally, though, her rough-edged style doesn't disappoint. 

Guitarist Nathan Howdeshell adds low, carefully calculated riffs that evoke the Breeders, and Kathy Mendonca's drumming is spare but sufficiently stomping. The band seems to revel in intentional cacophony, assaulting the ears with an oddly endearing out-of-tuneness on tracks like "Fire/Sign." 

With feedback and handclaps ("All My Days") rounding out their refreshingly unpolished sound, The Gossip is a welcome change from the cloying White Stripes clones of the moment. Out with overly slick garage rock, in with The Gossip's new Movement.

Headline: Is The Hulk to blame for rude audience?
Author: Robert J. Gramatges, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I went to Sunset Place on Friday night to see "The Hulk." As luck would have it, I was cast to the theater that would be known as the "reject table" in a high school cafeteria. The first indication of this was the terror that sat behind me. 

About three minutes into the film, my chair gets kicked. Big mistake. I felt I had to stand my ground and call the perpetrator's attention. I had to let her know I wasn't her personal shock absorber after the first infraction. I turn around to see a 9-year-old girl in a black shirt with a skull and crossbones imprint on it. She looked like a Hispanic Avril Lavigne groupie. I asked her to kindly keep her kicks to herself.

As is protocol with chair-kickers, she ignored my request. I let it fly thinking she would eventually tire out, but it only worsened. She proceeded to use both feet to push my chair with all her precious might. 

If she wasn't kicking my chair, she was pushing it. I was appalled. After telling her to stop three times, I let it go. 

I looked around the crammed theater for another seat, but I was with friends, so relocation was not an option. I was stuck and Avril Lopez had a sick smirk on her face like it was all part of her master plan. 

I had no choice but to put on my seat belt and endure the ride. I was used to the tapping, kicking and pushing within an hour. Interestingly, this was not the only altercation of the night. 

During a silent part of the movie a guy's cell phone rings. Instead of whispering to the caller that he is in a movie, the gentleman opted to take the call. He was soon involved in a conversation with his comrade on the other end. 

I think the best part was when he tried to talk over the movie. I am positive he thought the people at AMC were way out of line for not pausing the film while His Highness took the call. 

The man carried on for about thirty seconds before he was bombarded with "SHHHHHHHHHHH's." The problem with shushing in a theatre is that shushing is contagious. 

The crazy idea seems to be that the louder one shushes, the quieter the place will get. The guy on the cell phone had been quiet for five minutes before the last person shushed him. It is a vicious cycle: the shushing. Let it be known: there is no effective way to shush a shusher.

After those ulcer-causing episodes the movie was inconsequential. Instead of vowing to maim every person that was in that theater, I decided to take it all in stride. 

They were only acting up because they were bored by a mediocre movie. The movie was the problem, not the savage audience.

Headline: Special effects do little to save mediocre story
Author: Robert J. Gramatges, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Hulk has taken his place as Marvel Comics' newest comic book character turned big-budget-cash-cow. The not-so-jolly green giant is one of the first anti-hero protagonists to make the leap to the big screen, giving viewers a taste (if a two hour and eighteen minute movie can be considered just a taste) of the dark side of super human power.

Ang Lee, best known for 2000's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," directed the filmic adaptation of 1962's Stan Lee/Jack Kirby comic. The screenwriters slightly altered the original storyline by injecting modern technology into it, but the plot remains the same. 

An introvert plagued by years of repression, Bruce Banner is a hard nut to crack. He even keeps his emotions confidential with Betty Ross, the female love interest played by the classic beauty, Jennifer Connelly.

The emotional scars that fuel the flame he has burning inside him originate from a traumatic (borderline psychotic) childhood. The film moves in chronological order from Bruce's conception through a childhood of being his father's guinea pig/science project. 

Brian Banner, Bruce's mad scientist father, introduces the story's main conflict by injecting his son with chemicals he dreamt up in a laboratory. This creepy human experiment causes a chain of events that all lead to a crazy final product: a gigantic CGI monster that wreaks havoc on the western United States for over two hours. 

The movie is very ambitious in trying to tell this very intricate saga in one part. With so many interesting situations and characters to draw from, there was plenty of material for a sequel or two. 

It seems that the time crunch leaves the development of "The Hulk's" characters and their relationships in the backseat. The father-son relationship in the Banner family seems almost abbreviated. As the catalyst for the main character's inner conflict, it deserves much more development. Interestingly, the relationship between supporting characters Thunderbolt Ross and his daughter Betty takes most of the spotlight. 

This film leaves Bruce Banner's psyche hanging in terms of character development. It does not give moviegoers enough time to get to know the true Bruce in order to empathize with him. The film only scratches the surfaces of his potentially multifaceted characteristics.   

Visually, however, "The Hulk" is quite appealing. Ang Lee adds a vintage feel to the storytelling by splitting the screen into several cells in homage to comic books. He injects the screen with impressive footage and animation sequences that keep the eye entertained whenever the mind is about to drift off.  

The filmmakers depict The Hulk himself extraordinarily. For being completely computer generated, the character is impressively lifelike. Admirers of the always-innovative art of special effects are in for a treat with this one.

The action sequences are entities in themselves. This is where the film finds its niche. Whether he is battling tanks or mutant poodles, Hulk puts on a marvelous show while beating his enemies senseless. This, if anything, makes this film a must see.

 The action goes a bit haywire when the Hulk terrorizes the San Francisco Bay Area. It just seems overkill after a while. At this point the only thing on people's minds is "Will he just drop dead already!"

The lengthiness made the movie a tough pill to swallow for Americans who are used to instant gratification and fast-paced storytelling. Nevertheless, in the end, it brings action movies to another level. While not up to par with its Marvel counterparts, "The Hulk" deserves much credit for its edgy visuals and fantastic fights.

Headline: Sobre los gajes de ser universitario y empleado de restaurante
Subheadline: Awilda I. Castro Suárez

&nbsp;
La imagen del universitario que pasa sus horas de asueto discutiendo sobre los grandes filósofos, que se amanece junto a los amigos, los cigarros y el café montando diatribas eternas parece ser una imagen algo desgastada y alejada de la realidad actual. 

El perfil del nuevo universitario es el de un individuo que se levanta a las seis de la mañana, corre al gimnasio y se traga un "power bar" en la cogestión vehicular camino a la universidad. Asiste a su clase, se vuelve a meter en el tráfico y llega al trabajo.  Almuerza de pie, sale corriendo. Trabaja ocho horas de cajero u otra labor de $5.15 la hora y llega a su casa al borde de la medianoche con el cansancio que le jalonea todo el cuerpo. Aunque escucha que la cama lo llama con voz seductora, este estudiante se devana los sesos buscando en Internet la asignación que debe entregar el próximo día. El nuevo universitario es el que ruega que haya más clases nocturnas y sabatinas, el que siempre nada el Niágara para reunirse en grupo y opta por hacer los trabajos por su cuenta. ¿Pero por qué este fenómeno es cada vez más frecuente?

Porque toda la sociedad se mueve más rápido, los individuos tienen que producir más en menor tiempo para asegurar su competitividad. Además, la vida tiene exigencias mayores, tales como automóvil, teléfono móvil y vida social más costosa. En muchos casos, este tipo de estudiantes se ha independizado y vive por su cuenta, por lo cual un trabajo es una obligación y no una opción. Para ellos, mantenerse económicamente es una prioridad y estudiar pasa a un segundo plano. 

Son muchos los profesores que se quejan que los estudiantes de ahora no tienen el mismo compromiso de los de antaño con sus estudios. Las opiniones al respecto son diversas y, cada parte, como todo en la vida, tiene sus argumentos a favor y en contra.

La realidad es que la época universitaria sólo se vive una vez en la vida. Es para muchos un contacto con otras culturas, con otras ideas, con perspectivas distintas. Supone para muchos el último bastión a defender antes de sumergirse totalmente en la vida adulta. Tal vez es una visión romanticista, pero una plática sobre la inmortalidad del cangrejo en algún pasillo es una experiencia que cada universitario debe vivir y disfrutar, aunque ello suponga llegar un día tarde al trabajo de $5.15 la hora.

Headline: A la caza de voluntarios

Miami es una ciudad vulnerable a desastres naturales como huracanes, inundaciones y aun tornados. Además de esto, Miami es una ciudad que registra un alto índice de pobreza comparado con otras zonas metropolitanas de los Estados Unidos. Es por eso que el sur de la Florida requiere de un cuerpo de voluntariado que pueda suplir sus necesidades.

Precisamente, en Florida International University existe un grupo llamado Centro de Acción de Voluntariado (VAC por sus siglas en inglés), el cuerpo más grande de voluntarios de la universidad. 

Jessica Franchi-Alfaro, coordinadora del VAC, afirma que se trata de un grupo cuya misión es animar a los estudiantes a concientizarse de sus potenciales para impactar a la comunidad y efectuar un cambio social, a través del poder de servicio del aprendizaje y voluntariado.

Franchi explica que el voluntariado provee diversas oportunidades para los estudiantes y sirve para "aplicar el conocimiento adquirido de experiencias vividas para que el conocimiento sea mejorado y lograr canalizar los talentos, las energías y los ideales de los estudiantes dentro de una acción social positiva".

El VAC trabaja como un enlace entre la universidad y la comunidad. Por eso, esta organización une sus esfuerzos con el Miami Children's Hospital, entidad que se beneficia con el Programa Dance Marathon (el Baile Maratón). Su proposito es lograr batir el récord de 25 horas bailando, mientras se van recogiendo fondos para el hospital.

Otra de las suborganizaciones pertenecientes al VAC es Americorps (conocido como el Cuerpo de Paz Doméstico), que brinda tutorías y programas de formación de tutores, al igual que entrenamientos para la prevención del abuso y del asalto. Las personas que se involucran en esta organización reciben la cantidad de $2,365, que pueden ser usados por siete años si cumplen requisitos como completar un año con Americorps y 900 horas de servicio comunitario. 

El VAC trabaja con más de 150 agencias en los condados de Miami-Dade, Broward y Monroe. Entre las agencias con las que mantiene vínculos estrechos están Food For Life y Habitat for Humanity. Esta última es una agencia que construye casas para familias de bajos recursos económicos, bajo el concepto de ministerio cristiano ecuménico. Habitat for Humanity ha colaborado en áreas de extrema pobreza como el Pequeño Haiti, Overtown, Liberty City, Goulds, South Miami y Perrine desde 1989.  

"Los estudiantes pueden involucrarse en nuestros programas", afirma Franchi. "Básicamente, los estudiantes de primer año (freshmen) son los primeros a los que queremos reclutar, ya que ellos tienen la oportunidad de realizar actividades durante el término (los semestres) A y B durante el verano".

Una de las armas mas fuertes para el VAC es la colaboración de los profesores. Según Franchi,  cuentan con los profesores para que distribuyan información acerca del VAC.

Uno de los programas "estrellas" del VAC es el Alternative Spring Break. Este les da la oportunidad a los estudiantes de viajar a diversas ciudades e impactar en áreas que necesitan de voluntarios. 

"Nosotros enseñamos las causas y consecuencias del SIDA y VIH, la hambruna, el desamparo, la justicia social y las viviendas de bajos recursos", afirma Franchi. "Hemos estado en Nueva York, Washington, DC, Kentucky, Rhode Island, México, Orlando, Arizona, Filadelfia y Detroit". 

El VAC ofrece estos programas a los estudiantes "para que mejoren las condiciones de FIU y sus comunidades aledañas", concluye Franchi. A su juicio, la meta es ayudar a canalizar los beneficios, especialmente para los grupos más vulnerables "como las personas sin hogar y la gente de la tercera edad".

Si deseas involucrarte en programas de voluntariado, puedes contactar el VAC en el teléfono (305) 348-2149, o visitar sus oficinas en el Graham Center, oficina 340.

Headline: Competencia es igual a guerra: La nueva matemática de las ligas menores
Subheadline: Verónica C. Van Derdys
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Armando tiene nueve años y juega pelota desde que tenía cuatro. Se pasó su infancia rodeado de gente grande que le gritaba y le decía qué hacer. Armando un día se cansó.  Jugar ya no era diversión. Ahora debía ganar a cualquier precio, así fuera lastimar a sus compañeros.  La competencia era su trabajo, su responsabilidad, y se sentía abrumado.  

Armando llegó a bajar las calificaciones escolares para ganarse un viaje a Disney World y participar en un juego importante para ligas menores de peloteros. Y no sólo eso, Armando peleaba constantemente con sus contrincantes hasta el punto de dar y recibir golpes que lo llevaban a alejarse de la liga por suspensión y lo conducían al hospital.  

Después de constantes suturas y encontronazos con otros padres furiosos, los padres de Armando se dieron cuenta de que el deporte no lo era todo. Comenzaron a brindarle más importancia a los estudios del chico y a su comportamiento en los juegos.

"Desde los tres años tengo a mi hijo metido en deportes, hoy tiene nueve y es un experto pelotero, pero mejor aún, es un gran estudiante", afirma complacida Mónica Bonilla, madre de Armando, en relación al cambio que ha visto en el comportamiento de su hijo, después de que ella y su esposo entendieran que el juego de pelota era sólo parte del aprendizaje y desarrollo de su niño, no la vida misma.  

El equipo los Angelitos, ya había perdido varios "ángeles" en supensión por desobediencia y mal comportaminto en los juegos.  

"Parte de la culpa la teníamos nosotros mismos que íbamos al campo a gritarle y proferir palabras terribles al otro equipo. Mi esposo no permitía que poncharan al nene, sin antes gritarle al árbitro", dice Mónica sobre su comportamiento como espectadora y madre en los juegos de pelota en los que participaba su hijo.  

Fred Engh, presidente de la Alianza Nacional para Deportes Juveniles (NAYS por sus siglas en inglés), atestigua que en sus organizaciones, unas 2,200 en toda la nación, se han reportado alarmantes cifras de padres histéricos y hasta peligrosos en los campos de juego.  

"En el 1995 se esperaba que el cinco por ciento de una multitud de padres espectadores se saliera de la línea normal en un evento de ligas menores", señala Engh.  Estas cifras, según el presidente de la NAYS, cinco años después, subió al 15 por ciento, es decir, estos fueron los padres que sí se atrevieron a cruzar la línea con actitudes inapropiadas para el campo. 

"Esto llega a la locura, cada año veo peores y peores cosas", dice Engh.

El deporte en las ligas menores y el involucramiento de los niños debería ser de total diversión, un factor contribuyente a su desarrollo físico y espiritual, además de fomentar en el niño habilidades sociales. Pero la sociedad y el mismo deporte profesional han convertido una actividad de común aprendizaje, salud física y diversión en un negocio donde los golpes y la destrucción son permitidos, dan gracia y promueven campeonatos y rivalidades enfermizas entre equipos.  

Qué mejor ejemplo que ver a jugadores de hockey profesional, como Peter Worrell de los Florida Panthers o Darcy Tucker de los Toronto Maple Leaves, golpeándose hasta terminar sangrando en el suelo frío de un estadio y viendo como ninguno de los árbitros los separa. Es entonces el momento cuando la multitud de fanáticos comienza a gritar de histeria "golpéalo, mátalo", mientras esperan por varios segundos de pelea para enviarlos a una caja para penalizados, como si fuera un premio para el equipo y sus fanáticos.  Pareciera salido de una película, pero no lo es, es la realidad del deporte profesional y sus aficionados.  

"Es la mejor parte del juego. Verlos golpearse es la acción", recalca Brian Goodman, quien viajó desde Nueva York para observar, junto a sus dos hijos, un juego televisado en el estadio de los Panthers en Sunrise Fort Lauderdale durante la Fiesta del Juego de las Estrellas del 1 al 2 de febrero de este año.

La furia y la histeria ahora son parte de las ligas menores, así como el sinsentido de la afiliación a las mismas. Muchos padres anotan a sus hijos en deportes para llenar un vacío que ellos no pudieron llenar; quieren hacer con sus niños lo que sus padres no hicieron con ellos, pero están cometiendo el peor error de sus vidas. 

El presidente de la NAYS de Miami, que educa a entrenadores y padres en las necesidades del pequeño atleta, puntualiza varias razones por las cuales muchos padres, entrenadores y hasta niños se comportan tan mal en los campos de juegos.  

Engh afirma que muchos de los protagonistas del deporte juvenil están un tanto desensibilizados ante la violencia que se ve en los medios de comunicación. Además, menciona que los padres tienen expectativas poco reales del futuro de sus hijos en los deportes. Muchos quisieran que sus niños fueran el próximo Michael Jordan, Ricky Williams, Joe Montana o Wayne Gretzky.

Otro de los factores que promueven el infierno terrenal de los domingos es que muchos padres dejan que su ego sea parte de la acción y quieren demostrar que sus hijos son los mejores. Si éstos pierden o fallan, los hacen sentir como perdedores en lugar de alentarlos a una contínua competencia sana. El niño adopta estos comportamientos como normales y comienza a ver su carrera deportiva como un todo violento que no puede perder o, muchas veces, como una pesada carga obligatoria que no puede dejar atrás.  

"Yo sé que él se ponía muy nervioso en el juego; una vez me dijo que no quería jugar más", asegura la madre de Armando. "Tuvimos que cambiar nuestra forma de parecer y dejarlo que él eligiera lo quería hacer de verdad, si jugar o dejarlo".

Ya no es simplemente un "juego"

El doctor californiano Darrell J. Burnett, psicólogo clínico especialista en niños y deporte  y autor de la guía para padres "It's just a game" ("Sólo es un juego"), asegura que los deportes infantiles ya no son sólo un "juego".  

"Los medios están haciendo que los padres fantaseen con la publicidad para sus hijos en el deporte", afirma Burnett. La importancia que los periódicos locales y la televisión están dando a las estadísticas, las fotos y los nombres de los niños que juegan causa una especie de "efecto emocional" que lleva al juego por diversión a una dimensión de competencia y terrible violencia. Es un asunto que se convierte en un negocio y en una plataforma ideal para niños y padres, cuya única meta es ser una celebridad en el deporte.

Otro de los factores que complican la situación, según Burnett, es la formación de ligas de deportes por edades, gustos y reconocimiento nacional. 

"Los equipos que viajan se hacen cada vez más populares porque se ha creado el mito de que si tu hijo no es parte de un equipo de éstos, no entrara a una buena escuela o (que) la oportunidad de recibir una buena beca estará fuera de su alcance", dice Burnett.

Los padres tienen la creencia de que esto es verdadero y llevan a sus hijos ciegamente a la "beca segura" que supuestamente ofrece el deporte profesional.  

Por ejemplo, Joey Lorrocco, de 10 años de edad, pasa al menos cuatro días a la semana jugando hockey. Pertenece a un equipo que viaja y juega de forma profesional. 

"Yo quiero llegar a la Liga Nacional de Hockey de mi país, esta es la única forma de hacerlo", dice el niño. El es uno de los cientos de jovencitos que se juegan el todo para pertenecer a estos equipos que viajan.  

"A veces peleo, pero el entrenador nos lleva a la banca y nos penaliza. Siempre hay otros jugadores más agresivos que yo", asegura Joey con un aire de seriedad.  

Joe Larrocco, padre de Joey y también entrenador, exalta lo mucho que tiene que pagar porque su hijo participe en estos equipos que viajan.  

"Me encanta el hockey, yo lo juego casi diario, y quiero que mi hijo sea un profesional. Estoy contribuyendo a eso, es algo costoso pero se paga sólo con la experiencia y el prestigio que adquiere Joey", dice Larrocco sosteniendo un guante y un casco que pertenece a su hijo menor. Mientras, sus hijos juegan en la cancha de hielo del centro Incredible Ice en Coral Springs, Fort Lauderdale.  

Larrocco y sus hijos juegan hockey en otros lugares, como el Sportsmall en Pompano. Allí comparten con otros compañeros de equipo en un ambiente conocido desde que los niños estaban en edad de competir.

Joey no es el único que juega, todos sus amigos son parte de un equipo. Si no son jugadores, al menos, están aprendiendo para serlo próximamente. Es una fiebre que no los deja descansar. Muchas veces esa fiebre se convierte en más miedo que disfrute.  

"En la próxima temporada nos toca jugar con unos muchachos de Minnessotta, ellos son mayores que nosotros, categoría de 15 a 18, nos van a matar", aseguran preocupados Joey Larrocco y su amigo John Bernian sobre el juego que les espera a su equipo.  

Su categoría es de 10 a 13 años de edad, algo poco justo para estos chicos ya que los otros muchachos tienen más fuerza, habilidad y "malas costumbres", según John. 

"Tal parece que en Minnessotta no hay ligas de nuestra edad, nos da un poco de miedo", dice Joey. 

Cuando estas cosas pasan es que los juegos pueden tornarse violentos, sin alcanzar el gran trofeo de oro puro o una copa de plata. Los entrenadores y los árbitros comparten la culpa de llevar a estos niños a a casi una trifulca segura.

Herencia Violenta

En las canchas de fútbol para niñas pueden verse a las madres gritando palabras soeces a los árbitros. En las canchas de hockey se ve a los padres y madres casi saltando las bardas de protección si a uno de sus hijos le pasa algo en el juego. 

"Oye, ¿qué te crees? ¿Acaso eres ciego? ¡Idiota!", así le gritó una madre a un árbitro después de que éste le dio una llamada de penal a su hijo cuando golpeó a otro niño en un juego de hockey. Después de juegos como éste, se puede escuchar: "la próxima vez que te dejes hacer un gol, te voy a hacer un gol yo en la cabeza".  

Son comentarios que pueden hacer que un niño se torne a dos posiciones, según Jon C. Hellstedt en su libro "Niños, Padres y el Deporte".  Una es que el niño se convierta en una máquina de agresión constante. La otra es que se transforme en un chico lleno de terror y ansiedad que juega sólo para complacer a sus padres. La consecuencia es una baja autoestima que probablemente creará lo que se llama la "quemadura del deporte", una situación que lleva al niño o joven a evitar, por toda la vida, cualquier actividad que requiera esfuerzo físico. 

Según Eduardo Pastoriza, árbitro de ligas juveniles en hockey de hielo, las cosas que se oyen de los padres son terribles y los muchachos son los peores que se sienten.

"Como árbitro es difícil complacer a todos, hago lo que debo hacer, sigo reglas, pero lo peor es ver las caras de los chicos cuando sus padres están arriba gritando tonterías, se ridiculizan", dice Pastoriza quien trabaja como miembro oficial de la liga de árbitros USA Hockey desde el 1996.  

"Es diferente cada liga... pero las de los adolescentes jóvenes son más difíciles porque son gente que no sólo se golpea en serio, sino que (también) se insultan y hasta se amenzan en serio", concluye Pastoriza.

La violencia y el estado de inconsistencia psicológica en la que un niño o joven se enfrenta al involucrarse en deportes pueden llevarlos a la locura. El caso de la muerte de Michael Costin fue la gota que colmó el vaso de la violencia desmedida en los deportes juveniles y acaparó la atención de los medios. Un padre-entrenador fue asesinado por otro en un juego. Costin, de 40 años, vigilaba a sus tres hijos y un amigo en una práctica de hockey el julio de 5 de 2000 en el estadio Burbank Ice en Reading, Massachussets. De repente, el hijo de Thomas Junta fue golpeado contra uno de los vidrios y la acción se tornó ruda. Junta, de 42 años, le gritó a Costin que evitara que eso sucediera de nuevo ante lo que Costin le contestó: "de eso se trata el hockey". Esto produjo una trifulca en la que Junta dejó inconsciente a Costin. Posteriormente, Costin falleció.  Junta pasará 20 años en prisión por asesinato. 

A raíz de esto, asociaciones deportivas en pro de la paz, la hermandad y el respeto en los deportes se pusieron de acuerdo para hacer valer las reglas de respeto y comportamiento adecuado entre cada padre, entrenador y árbitro involucrado en deportes juveniles. La Alianza Nacional de Deportes Juveniles y la Asociación de Deportes Juveniles se encargan de trabajar por un ambiente más deportivo, sano y educativo con personas en control de sus acciones. Es un trabajo que parece arduo y pesado, no sólo porque son muchos los casos a atender, sino también porque muchos piensan "a lo Vince Lombardi", quien dijo que en la vida y el deporte "ganar no lo es todo, es la única cosa".
