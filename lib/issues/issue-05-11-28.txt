Headline: Federer better than the rest
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Roger Federer of Switzerland lost to David Nalbandian of Argentina in the Tennis Masters Cup finals Nov. 20.

It was headline news around the world. But not in America.

Internationally, Federer is recognized as the greatest athlete alive. 

Entering his match with Nalbandian, Federer was playing for his 25th consecutive victory in a tournament final. 

He was two points away from tying John McEnroe's 1982 record for the best season in tennis history. With the loss, Federer finished the year at 81-4; McEnroe was 82-3 in '82. 

That's why this result was so important. It finally confirmed Federer as human.

ESPN2 broadcasted the match on a 12-hour tape delay, half a day after the rest of the world knew that history had been made. 

The next morning, The Miami Herald printed a seven-paragraph summary of the match in an article that also featured marathon, bowling and field hockey news. 

Wait a minute.

This man was one win away from equaling the greatest season in the history of tennis. I think that's a tad more important than Mike Scroggins bowling a 245 and Emily Kroshus running in her first race.

Roger Federer is the No. 1 tennis player in the world - has been for 96 consecutive weeks. 

There's a reason why Martina Navratilova called him a magician, and Pete Sampras said "he can do just about anything he wants with a racket."

He is and he can.

Federer owns every shot in the book, and has even written in a few new ones. 

With one fluid motion, he whips a topspin forehand, sending the ball inches over the net before it bounces twice in front of Lleyton Hewitt, who has lost nine straight matches to Federer. 

From the backhand wing, Federer slices the ball cross-court with so much sidespin that after bouncing inside the lines, it tails completely off Wimbledon's Centre Court, where the Swiss has won three straight titles.

He plays a brand of tennis that has amazed everyone around him - fans, journalists and players alike. Don't believe me? 

"There's only so long you can deny it. He's the best I've ever played against," said Andre Agassi, after Federer defeated him to win the 2005 US Open. 

America's top-ranked player Andy Roddick has a 1-10 lifetime record against Federer. As he so eloquently puts it, "The dude is sick."

McEnroe held the ATP record of 12 consecutive finals won before Federer doubled that mark in Bangkok, Thailand this past October. Johnny Mac called Federer "the most gifted player I've ever laid my eyes on."

Federer's tennis has even captured the attention of seven-time Tour de France champion, Lance Armstrong.

"He has totally a complete game: a good serve, can play from the net, everything," Armstrong said. "He's awesome."

Awesome indeed, though it seems like America has yet to realize it. 

Americans are hung up on baseball, basketball and football, but consider this:the 2001 Seattle Mariners posted the best record in MLB history by finishing 116-46. In his last 162 matches, Federer is 152-10. The 1995-96 Chicago Bulls set the all-time NBA mark with a 72-10 record. In his last 82 matches, Federer is 78-4. 

The New England Patriots recently broke an NFL record by winning 21 consecutive games. Since June 2004, Federer has had winning streaks of 23, 26, 25 and 35 matches respectively.

From November 2003 through January 2005, Federer won 24 matches in a row against opponents ranked in the Top 10, beating the likes of Nalbandian, Hewitt, Agassi and Roddick. 

Imagine Southern California's football team winning 24 straight games against Top-10 opponents. Impossible. 

Federer won three Grand Slam championships in 2004 without a coach. 

Imagine Tom Brady winning his three Super Bowl rings without Bill Belichick.Impossible.

So Federer lost a final to Nalbandian in a 5th-set tiebreak, after four hours and 33 minutes of grueling tennis. 

The Swiss finished the 11-month tennis season having played in 12 different countries - not exactly the Miami-to-Oakland road trip Dolphin players are always complaining about.. 

Federer won all four American tournaments he played in 2005, including the Nasdaq-100 Open in Key Biscayne. 

He was named one of the "Sexiest Men Alive" in People Magazine's Nov. 28 issue, but there's another magazine title Federer deserves.

Sports Illustrated will name the Sportsman of the Year in its Dec. 12 issue. Federer is in contention to become the first non-American winner since Norwegian speed-skater Johann Olav Koss in 1994, and the first tennis winner since the late, great Arthur Ashe in 1992.

"I'll just be who I am: Roger Federer," he said. "If people like me, that would be nice. I'm not going to force the issue."

Roger Federer has spent too much time among the marathon runners and field hockey players of the world. 

In dominating tennis, he has dominated sport.

Headline: Watching pro receiver helped Williams improve
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Over the last couple of weeks, Chandler Williams has reestablished himself as the Golden Panthers' top receiver. 

The coaches and players believe it all has to do with some advice that he never paid attention to in the past.

"Chandler watched Marvin Harrison against New England," said head coach Don Strock. "When they beat them, and he noticed Marvin catches the ball and goes straight up the field. He runs square routes. All of a sudden, Chandler has become Chandler Harrison or Marvin Williams." 

Since this transformation, induced by watching film on Indianapolis Colts' star wide receiver Marvin Harrison, Williams' numbers have improved dramatically and he has been called on in pressure situations. 

In the win against Western Kentucky on Nov. 19, Williams' number was called upon twice in the final drive as Cory McKinney had been neutralized all night. 

Williams caught passes of 28 and 21 yards, setting up the game-winning, Adam Moss field goal in the three-point, 38-35, win.

"Before," admits Williams, "I would just use my speed to try and run past people, but now I am breaking down and faking. He is basically the same size as me, so, what greater a player to watch."

The improvement has been considerable as Williams connected with Padrick eight times in the win and gained 129 yards. 

The junior from Miami Senior High has two games with at least 100 yards receiving this season and has caught 51 passes for 684 yards. His statistics are good enough for first on the team in receptions, receiving yards and receiving average at 76 yards per game. 

Quarterback Josh Padrick is pleased with the improvement from his favorite target.

"He has been running aggressive routes," Padrick said. "Running picture-perfect routes and getting open where he is supposed to be; it has been helping him a lot as well as the offense."

The senior signal caller went on to explain how it all came into being. 

 "The coaches joke with him," Padrick said. "All season and in practices, he runs his routes pretty well, then when it comes time for games, he'll run a little sloppy route here and there. [Coach Greg Briner] said, 'You need to run the routes like you do in practice.' So one day, he sat down and watched the film on Marvin Harrison and ever since then he has been totally different."

Williams added, "The coaches had always told me to do that, but I don't know why watching Marvin Harrison [convinced me] to do it."

Regardless of the motive, it appears as though watching film has revitalized the Golden Panther receiver.

Subheadline: Football's third victory comes off the leg of senior
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For the second time this season, Adam Moss had the game in his hands. This time the ending was storybook. 

Moss connected from 36 yards out as time expired to give the Golden Panthers (3-6, 1-4 SBC) their first win in three tries against the Division I-AA Hilltoppers of Western Kentucky (6-5, 4-3 Gateway), 38-35 Nov. 19.

"After the North Texas game," said head coach Don Strock,  "I saw [Moss] in the parking lot; he was feeling a little down because he missed the field goal that would have tied it and I told him 'I am going to call on you again'. He certainly came through today. We have confidence in him, I'm just proud of the way these guys played."

The Golden Panthers, struggling to put players out on the field because of a massive amount of injuries, came through when they needed it the most. 

"We played a lot of guys that have not played before; we were running out of people." Strock said. "This is a big difference from our first year when we played. You can see the progress that we have made; obviously, this is a huge win for us." 

Josh Padrick led the way for the Golden Panther offense, which had to make up for a banged up defense that was short on players. 

Padrick completed 22-of-36 passes for 324 yards and a touchdown to backup tight end Moses Hinton, who stepped in for an injured Samuel Smith. 

Chandler Williams led all receivers on the night catching eight passes, two of which came on the last drive, for 129 yards. 

FIU began their last drive of regulation on their own 30. Following an incomplete pass by Padrick and a short run by Adam Gorman, the senior quarterback completed passes of 28 and 21 yards to Williams that set up the game winning 36-yard boot by Moss. 

Padrick and Moss were named the Sun Belt Conference Offensive and Special Teams players of the week, respectively, following their performances against Western Kentucky.

Subheadline: Financial aid award amounts not enough for those who truly need it
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The next time you receive your check for financial aid, be sure to put money aside for shopping sprees, lunch outings and a new car. 

That's what some students do once tuition and fees are paid off.

By filling out that trusty "Free Application for Federal Student Aid" form, college becomes a bit easier, well, at least paying for it does.

For the lucky ones who receive a substantial amount of money, life is very easy indeed. Not so for the unlucky ones. Applying for loans, asking family members for money and selling your kidney on eBay, just to pay for tuition and books, are roads that should be less traveled.

But what about those who apply for financial aid and receive almost nothing? The FAFSA offers them the option of work study, which means you're given a job on campus meant to pay for your collegiate expenses. 

That doesn't seem like such a bad thing, right? Wrong. Once the semester for which you applied ends, your FIU employer doesn't have to take you back. So you find yourself broke, proclaiming your hatred for FIU and thinking that the kidney option is the only way out.

It is ridiculous to see students pay off car payments, cell phone bills and credit cards with financial aid money when other students are working two jobs just to hang on. Financial aid money should only be used for tuition and books. Any other expense should be considered a luxury, not a reward.

Applying for loans is something which high school counselors warn incoming freshmen not to do. Loans seem like an easy solution, but as you're heading home after graduation, thinking back on your achievements, loan collectors are already waiting at your door, wanting their money back.

Some students enter college with the perception that by having a Florida Bright Futures Scholarship, applying for financial aid is not necessary. 

Applying for aid might be a tedious process, you must provide your parent's tax return and a series of online forms, but every student should go through it. 

Depending on your family's income, your GPA and whether or not you're are a full-time student, is how your award is decided. Following the application process, you receive an expected amount of aid, but FIU is the last to decide.

Headline: Self Image
Subheadline: Young women taking it too seriously
Author: Shannon hernandez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In the moment of truth, we must succumb to our gender, the differences we can make and how gender has made us who we are as women and the identity of who we are today. 

Gender has implicated its importance upon body image, mental health and the roles we play as females. Stigmas, such as perfection, are consistently present. The stereotypes that pertain to being a female leader inside and outside the classroom can lead to great pressure and misperceived self-expectations, no matter what class or ethnicity.

 Eating disorders are at a high, especially among young girls, and female college students. Many young women today reflect a large percentage of the population of students in college. Studies suggest that white, middle and upper-class girls appear to be most vulnerable to stress produced by normative definitions of mature femininity and the need for perfection, more so than males or any other ethnicity. 

One study, performed by Stice and Whitenton in 2002, found that being overweight, perceived pressure to be thin, internalization of thin ideal and lack of social support predicted body dissatisfaction in adolescent girls. 

This is disturbing news. A "fat spurt" is said to be a time when girls experience a rapid gain in fat and height around puberty.  Average weight gain during this time is 24 pounds.

Some girls, however, develop at a much more rapid pace than others.

"[Seventh grade girls] continued to look like little girls. I was embarrassed and ashamed. I realized that I was slowly getting larger in the size of my jeans," said freshman Lacey Anderson. "My hips were rounding, my breasts were rounding. And the boys were noticing. The boys were not impressed with this sudden change. They were mocking, teasing and cruel. I began to diet. Puberty had become my private hell."

White, middle and upper-class girls are more affected by school, the pressure for perfect grades, and are more likely to suffer from eating disorders than any other ethnicity or social class. In a study conducted by Regnerus and Cox, published in Social Psychology Quarterly and involving more than 3,500 students in seventh through 12th grades, pubertal growth was linked to having perceptions of being overweight by both sexes. In contrast, this growth had a greater effect on girl perceptions of being overweight than the boys. 

Courtney Leigh, a senior, said her adolescence was difficult, in part because her family valued males at the expense of females.

"My sister, mother and I had poor body images, and my mother eventually found the loneliness and resentment of being a stay at home housewife and mother," Leigh said. "Her anger [grew] as she realized that my father's job had now become more important than his wife. She discovered diet pills; I was still struggling with bulimia, my sister with weight gain and my brother with basketball."

Girls who mature early and reach menarche before the age of 12 have the highest rate of depressive symptoms. Many factors apparently contribute to body dissatisfaction among adolescent girls. 

Gender and role are intertwined. Roles conferring authority and power are usually played by men, while women occupy subordinate positions. There is evidence proving that overweight women are more severely stigmatized than men. Overweight women are less likely to be supported for college from parents and are therefore more likely to earn less money.      

Women should learn to understand their bodies, the changes they endure and the encouragement of achievements other than body image. Instead of emphasizing external beauty, we need to stress that it is safe to be healthy and happy with who we are.

Headline: The displaced
Subheadline: Hurricane Katrina changed the lives of many students, many of whom are now at FIU. The Beacon talked to four students. Here are their stories.
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
For Alicia Jencik, Aug. 26 was like any other day. 

She did homework, went to work and like most residents in New Orleans, expected Hurricane Katrina to hit North Florida instead. 

"I knew that we would still have some wind and rain, so I went to the grocery store and got some extra water and canned food just in case we lost power," Jencik said.

But when the storm took an unexpected turn toward the Crescent City, Jencik, a political science graduate student at the University of New Orleans, booked a flight home to Miami. 

Jencik is one of 149 displaced students attending FIU as a result of Hurricane Katrina's destruction. 

Fatima Rojas, also a student at UNO who is currently at FIU, evacuated to Baton Rouge along with her family. 

After staying in a hotel for over a week, the Rojas family realized they could not return. 

"We decided to go to Miami and stay with family," Rojas said.

Rojas's Miami relatives phoned her to let her know that FIU was accepting displaced students.  

"My family flew me out here the next day," Rojas said. 

The rest of her family drove down later that week.

Rojas, a senior, is currently taking the last four courses needed to obtain a degree in elementary education.  

Leonardo Ramirez, another UNO student currently attending FIU said he doesn't want to return to New Orleans next semester.

"Being at FIU makes me feel like I'm at a real university ... like the ones you see in the movies," said Ramirez, a junior majoring in journalism.

Other students like freshman Michelle Solove never even started their first day of college at Tulane University. 

Solove had planned to join the Ecology Club and rush a sorority in the Spring semester, but after hearing from a friend that officials were considering closing the city, she booked an airplane ticket for Miami and arrived late Saturday night to a home without phone lines or electricity.

Not only have these students endured a challenging past few weeks, they also share a great appreciation for the university that fostered them. 

"They [have been] extremely helpful and flexible with my situation," Solove said. "I made friends during rush week and found a Jewish fraternity. There was an instant bond."

Jencik agrees.

"The students and the faculty have been extremely kind. Several students have offered to help me if I have any questions and the faculty was extremely supportive," She said. "It was so nice of FIU to open its doors to students who were displaced."

The university has continued to support these students by hosting a welcoming session - a casual dinner and orientation tour to inform students about university updates. 

The Sept. 26 event was coordinated by April Mann, associate director of orientation and commuter student services.

Larry Lunsford, associate vice-president of student affairs, was not able to attend the entire event because of a class, but he noticed that the parents and students present were delighted with the way the university staff handled their situation.

"It was a small attendance, but those who were there were appreciative of the university extending a hand," Lunsford said. 

Out of the 149 displaced students enrolled at FIU, only about 20 parents and students combined attended the session, according to Mann. 

The three-hour long session provided students with information on financial aid, admissions and student finances. 

"It was designed to have students meet with faculty from their area [of study] and everyone was very grateful to have that opportunity," said Rosa Jones, vice president of student affairs.

After dinner, peer advisors took the group on a campus tour to answer any questions and concerns.

At the end of the night individual groups of parents and students spoke to university officials.

"There were a lot of students and parents who expressed their appreciation to all of the faculty and staff present," Mann said.

The university has not yet indicated whether or not these students should return to their home institutions. 

However, many of their institutions are trying to reopen in the Spring semester, according to Jones.

"They have been admitted to the university like our regular students and they are welcomed to stay throughout the semester or throughout their college career," Mann said.

Headline: Students disagree on financial aid distribution
Author: Fallan Thompson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Like a number of students at the Biscayne Bay Campus, Agustin Grulia is still hopeful about being able to pay for college next semester. 

Grulia has earned the Florida Bright Futures Medallion Scholars award, which  earns him 75 percent tuition coverage, but doesn't qualify for financial aid because his parents make too much money. 

"Those students who get money back from financial aid are really lucky," Grulia, a student majoring in print journalism said.

 Financial aid, Bright Futures Scholarships, Stafford Loans and federal grants are the main ways students pay for tuition and university expenditures. 

Students must complete the Free Application For Federal Student Aid, commonly known as the FAFSA, every academic year in time for the results to be sent to the university of their choice. 

The FAFSA is a compilation of the student's and his or her parents' taxes from the previous year. 

Based on the results from the FAFSA, the federal government decides the amount of Expected Family Contribution, which measures how much the student's family should be able to contribute toward the student's education. 

The university then decides if the student gets financial aid and how much he or she is entitled to. 

The problem is that many students, like Brenda Espinal, who qualify for financial aid and get it, usually end up with a surplus of federal money. 

Espinal, a junior majoring in communications, qualified for financial aid and two federal grants. 

After her tuition was paid, she received $1,400 in surplus federal aid. 

However, she made plans for her money. 

"I put $900 in savings for my car and its insurance, and kept the other $500 to spend on other stuff," she said.

Gregory Mackey, a coordinator for the Financial Aid department, agrees.

"It's for their own use ... for their educational expenses. They can get Bright Futures, an award from the school and free money from the government," Mackey said. "All the financial aid should be for your education, but even students who take out loans pay for their rent or pay for their car."

 The qualifications to receive financial aid include demonstrating financial need, being a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen, maintaining a satisfactory GPA depending on major and being enrolled at least half-time. 

Students, like Grulia, who do not qualify for federal aid, can get a loan to supplement their income.

Loans are easier to receive than financial aid because they are not based on financial need. 

If a high school student qualifies for a Bright Futures Scholarship, which is provided by the Florida Lottery, the student must be enrolled full time, maintain a minimum GPA and have a certain SAT score. 

Winners of the Florida Bright Futures Academic Scholars Award receive 100 percent tuition coverage and fees and must maintain a 3.0 GPA. 

Students with the Florida Medallion Scholars Award receive 75 percent tuition coverage and must maintain a 2.75 GPA.

Over 120,000 students received these awards in the 2003-2004 academic year, according to the Bright Futures website.

Students graduating high school outside of Florida do not qualify for this award. 

The surplus comes from a combination of grants, financial aid and scholarships provided to students who needed help in paying their tuition. 

It helps students afford other things, such as the car insurance Espinal is spending her surplus on.

However, students who do qualify for the Bright Futures Scholarships can end up losing it and sometimes have to rely on loans to supplement what they lost.

Karla Santiago, who is majoring in broadcast journalism, lost her Florida Medallion Scholars Award because her GPA dropped below the 2.75 minimum requirement. 

"I am currently taking 17 credits to bring up my GPA, and I work part time," she said. 

Santiago is still working on her loan paperwork and is considered 'under debt' by the college. 

The EFC is another important factor in determining  how much a student is entitled to receive, according to Mackey.

"It is unfair in a sense when one student needs to take out a loan and other students are spending it on extra things," Mackey said. "But you also have to take a look at the student's family income."

Santiago also pointed out that if a student has a Florida Bright Futures Academic Scholars Award and drops below the GPA requirement of 3.0, the student will get demoted to the Florida Medallion Scholars Award while he or she brings up his or her GPA. 

If the student fails to bring up his or her GPA after one semester, he  is dropped from the Bright Futures program.

 However, if a student has the Florida Medallion Scholars Award and drops below the GPA requirement, the student is dropped from the scholarship program completely and must earn it back. 

All students should check out every option available by frequently checking in with the financial aid office. 

Also, students must remember to complete the FAFSA as soon as possible, to receive the best financial help. 

Students can begin applying for the 2006 - 2007 year on Jan. 1.

Fastweb.com and scholarships.com are both free scholarship websites that cater to students in need.

Headline: Deepawali 2005
Subheadline: Festival promoting unity within diversity delivers
Author: Michelle Santisteban
&nbsp;
On Nov. 19, the Indian Students Association (ISA) presented their annual cultural event Deepawali 2005, which featured a parade of events including classical and national dances, musical performances, dramatic and comedic skits and an extravagant fashion show all in celebration of Diwali.

"It is the Hindu festival celebrating the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil and the joy of life," said Vijay Pradeep, a public relations representative for the ISA. 

Diwali, the festival of lights, is the most popular and anticipated festival in India. It is celebrated throughout the country and within Indian communities all over the world. It lasts five consecutive days through the gathering of families, friends, relatives and the exchange of sweets and gifts. It is celebrated with elaborate firework displays, oil-lit lamps and lights to celebrate life and unity in diversity among the people of India.

"I thought it was amazing," said sophomore Monique Tavares. "It was very entertaining and they put a lot of hard work into it." 

Lidia Cabrera, a sophomore, expressed her satisfaction by congratulating the organizers of the event. 

"I am extremely pleased that the Indian Student Association organized the Deepawali 2005 show because it gave me a lot of exposure to the Indian culture," Cabrera said.

ISA plans to use the proceeds of the show for disaster relief funds, including the Hurricane Katrina, tsunami and Earthquake Relief fund in the Middle East. 

Sartaj Singh Saini, who is serving his second term as ISA president wants the FIU community to know of the diverse involvement that went into the event.  

"A lot of members wanted to be involved in the event, especially graduate students. We wanted to not only attract Indian students, but students of other backgrounds as well," Saini said. 

Rajiva Desai, a student and member of the ISA, treated the audience to the first of many dance performances of the night. After giving the audience a brief introduction about "Kathak," a north Indian dance that tells a story through dance, Desai proceeded to tell the love story of a married couple separated in times of war through a mesmerizing dance incorporating facial expressions, stylistic movements and postures. The audience was also treated to a sing along by Clandestined, a student band who presented a curry session, which was an amalgamation of Indian, American and English rock tracks with an added spice.   

The highlight and finale of the evening was "panther bhangra", a performance of the extremely popular Indian dance that originated from Punjab, a state in northern India. The performance was greeted enthusiastically by a loud, diverse crowd of more than 500 students, faculty, staff, Indian families and teens.

Popular themes throughout the evening were Bollywood inspired dances. Bollywood is the nickname for the Indian Film Industry, the largest in the world. At least three performances were devoted to dancing and lip synching to songs from Indian movies. The most popular with the audience was "kajra re," a performance with two couples dressed in glitzy outfits mirroring a night club scene. 

"'Kajra re' was definitely my favorite performance of the evening. It was very well done," said Sana Viqar, a Nova Southeastern University who attended the event.

However, not everything was singing and dancing. The students of ISA put on two skits, polar opposites in subject matter and mood. The first, a drama written by students Kantesh Balani and Kanchan Jothwani, dealt with dowry, money lenders, poverty and its tragic effect on farmers in India. The second was a slapstick comedy modernizing the story behind Diwali. 

The extravagant fashion show, which has been a popular segment at every ISA Deepawali event over the years, was a show-stopper. Watching students cat-walking in glamorous traditional clothing, as well as trendy modern Indian outfits, was a sight to behold.

Apart from the program of the evening, there were also stalls set up outside the auditorium where guests could sample authentic Indian cuisines, and buy outfits and jewelry - all confirming that the program offered a complete experience for a non-Indian looking to learn about the Indian community.

The ISA of FIU is the most diverse Indian Student Association in the country. MTV Desi, an Indian unit of MTV, based a documentary on this fact alone. Contrary to belief, only half of the association members originate from India. This makes the association a truly diverse organization. The ISA holds its meetings every other Wednesday and can be contacted at www.fiu.edu/~isa and at fiuisa@fiu.edu.

Headline: Adopt a Pet
Subheadline: Loving new family additions found at local shelters
Author: Michelle Santisteban
&nbsp;
Do you wish to get home and have a Golden Retriever wag his tail at you? Or have a cat purr and caress your legs?

It can become reality by adopting a pet. In Miami-Dade County, thousands of cats and dogs are abandoned and there is something the public can do to help. 

Instead of searching for a new family addition at a local pet shop, there is another option available that is not only cheaper but can also save a life.

Adopting a pet is a great alternative and there are many benefits which come along with it - including receiving pets that are guaranteed to be vaccinated, spayed or neutered and healthy to the best of veterinarian's knowledge.

There are a wide variety of cats and dogs to choose from, all lovable and wanting a home. 

"So many homeless pets need homes and any shelter has hundreds of puppies and kittens," said Laurie Hoffman, shelter operations director for the Soffer and Fine Adoption Center.

The Humane Society has three shelters in Miami-Dade County offering adoptions and clinics. There are also various other similar organizations to adopt from.

Many shelter adopting programs have begun to become no-kill programs, which are facilities that euthanize animals if they are not adopted in a short period of time. In Miami-Dade County, more than 20,000 cats and dogs are euthinzed every year.  

According to several adoption facilities, there are several advantages to adopting including getting animals that are not related by blood.

"Breeders are mixing brothers and sisters and the puppies and kittens are coming out with genetic defects ... it's morally wrong," said Dona Halpern, owner of Fairy Tailes adoption. "A buyer (at a pet shop) is not assured the pet they are buying is not coming from a puppy mill."

Adoption agencies believe that there are also benefits in adopting animals that are not puppies.  

Older dogs are smarter and have already had the basic household training; they know what "no" means. Cats are also a better choice than a kitten when there may be children in the home. 

"Kittens crawl through everything and kids could get hurt with their thin nails," Halpern said.

A concern that many people have is that they want pure breed animals and feel that at adopting shelters they will only find mixed breeds. 

"About 20 percent of the animals we have come in here are pure breeds," Hoffman said. 

However, there are private adoption agencies that specify in certain breeds. For example, the Buddies Thru Bullies organization focus primarily on English Bulldogs. 

Started in 1995 as breeders, Buddies Thru Bullies soon decided to focus on English Bulldogs after a high number began to appear in shelters. So from breeders, they became an English Bulldog rescue team. 

"We help for the love of the breed," said Carol Ackroyb, a member of the Buddies Thru Bulldog organization. "We began to realize how many English Bulldogs were being abandoned and felt we needed to help these unfortunate dogs."  

Due to the destruction suffered in New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina, many orphaned and lost pets are being sent to Miami to find homes. Halpern is currently housing some of these unfortunate dogs and has made sure their heart worms are being treated medically taken care of.

Volunteering is also an option for people who want to help, but cannot house animals. Most Humane Society clinics and adoption agencies are always looking for people to volunteer. 

One option is housing a dog or cat until it gets adopted. Also, Fairy Tail Adoption goes to the Petco location in Kendall every Saturday to have animals adopted. They accept volunteers as young as 12- years-old.

Society needs to lend a helping hand in order to start putting an end to the abandonment of pets. By adopting and volunteering alone, a huge difference can be made.

Headline: Cash biopic walks the line between greatness and tripe
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Walk the Line, the high-profile Johnny Cash biopic starring Joaquin Phoenix as the "man in black," manages to provide more than just a poignant storyline in a movie season full of dramatic fare.

I've been a die-hard fan of the legendary singer's dark, piercing baritone since I was young, so I'll admit, I went to see the movie with critical eyes and ears, waiting to see if Hollywood and Phoenix would be able to reproduce the greatness of that hope-filled voice on the giant screen.

To my surprise, though, they not only reproduced it, they also managed to stage great performances comparable to any of Cash's famous concerts, as was evident from the rhythmic reaction the film pulled from the audience.

Walk the Line follows the tried-and-tested formula of so many earlier film biographies, showing the singer's life from his poor childhood in Arkansas; his career as part of the so-called "Million Dollar Quartet," touring with Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins; marital problems with his first wife; eventual drug addiction and finally, his happily-ever-after romance with country star June Carter, played by a deceptively sweet Reese Witherspoon.

What separates this movie from some of the other rags-to-riches celebrity bios is director James Mangold's handling of Cash's music and the inspired decision to have Phoenix and Witherspoon (who don't resemble the singers very much) perform their own vocals. Although both actors manage to perfectly nail the nuances and contours of their respective characters' voices, it's Mangold's quick close-ups and high lighting that help to accentuate the artistic and sexual tension between both performers, both of whom were married for many years and could only dream of consummating their love.

Besides the duets, Phoenix and Witherspoon manage to do just fine on their own - bringing intensity and charisma when performing solo. 

The best scenes in the movie remain Cash's audition before recording legend Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) as he nervously finds his voice by singing "Folsom Prison Blues" and the movie's last performance as his notorious, bad-boy reputation culminates in a concert given to inmates of the prison that inspired that first song.

Witherspoon also gets to lampoon the bubbly roles that have made her famous by showing us a cheeky, high-pitched, on-stage Carter who only wears that persona to hide the insecurities that have made her so stern and weary off-stage.

The movie still suffers from some of the biopic genre's main faults, specifically monologues delivered so melodramatically that they verge on comical (with Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife Vivian bearing most of the load.) Cash fans may also notice such plot additions as the inclusion of the classic overbearing father (Robert Patrick), a rather silly tractor accident scene and a fictional marriage proposal. 

Also, it is never properly explained that Cash's signature song "I Walk the Line" was written to express the difficulties of staying faithful to his wife, which would have vastly helped the plot since the movie's title is taken from that tune.

Despite these faults, the film still manages to give its audience what the trailers promised, a legendary love story and great music. From the rock-n-roll sounds of "Get Rhythm" and "Cry, Cry, Cry" to the folksy appeal of "It Ain't Me, Babe" and "Ring of Fire," Walk the Line will, if anything, serve to reintroduce the music of one of America's most influential and missed balladeers to a new generation.
