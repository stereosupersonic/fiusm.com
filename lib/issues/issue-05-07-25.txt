Headline: Diary of a Frat Pledge - Part 2
Author: Charlene Collazo and Cyntianna Ledesma / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
In the last edition of The Beacon, the tale of 18-year-old Agustin Barbara's experiences during fraternity recruitment week was unfolding.

Fraternity recruitment week started July 11, a week in which fraternal organizations on campus have hopes meeting a great group of new potential members. It also marked the beginning of Barbara's life as a college student.

In hopes that his experience would somehow clear those misconceptions many have about fraternal organizations and the recruitment process, Barbara recounted what he went through in order to join. 

To recap, Part I of his diary began July 11 when he participated in the Greek Barbecue and had the chance to speak to different organizations. This is where our staff writers met the hopeful freshman, enthusiastically speaking to his fraternity of choice: Sigma Phi Epsilon or "Sig Ep." July 12 was the official "kick-off" night of each organization's individual party, but unfortunately, Barbara could not make it. His last night during Part I of his experience was July 13 when he attended Meet the Sig Eps night.

His "diary" continues as the second half of the week was approaching and potential members grew anxious to discover whether or not they would become members of the fraternity organizations of their choice.  

It was July 14, and Barbara attended a barbecue hosted by Sig Ep at a member's house. It was definitely apparent that the week was coming to an end, as the parties seemed to become more of a one-on-one interaction between brothers and potential members. The barbecue was definitely an opportunity for potential members to mingle a little more. 

This was also an event that would give members of these organizations an idea of which potential members were serious about joining, their characteristics and if they would be a great asset to the organization.

During the barbecue, Barbara had the opportunity to meet with more brothers than he had in the past. He also had the opportunity to meet girls from different sororities. The barbecue itself proved to be an essential event for Barbara to promote himself before any member selection within the organization was done. He had fun, but things would get much more interesting later on during the week.

A party to commemorate the final day of recruitment week (July 15) was the last chance for Barbara and others to make a good impression. But this was not the typical getting-to-know-each-other gathering. On this day fraternities held themed social parties where candidates met a variety of different people associated with the Greek system on campus, as well as danced and just cut loose.

That night, Barbara attended the Sig Ep wet-and-wild party called Seuss' Landing. With a Dr. Seuss theme, it was held at a member's house with a mixture of water slides, water balloons and music. The purpose for these parties was to stray away from the seriousness of the week. It was also a chance for potential members to show a little of their fun and relaxed sides.

After a night of conversation overload and partying, Bid Day had finally arrived. This was the day all potential members would find out whether or not they had been accepted into their organization of choice. 

On July 16 all members awaited a phone call from a brother, either extending them a "bid" to join or an apology for not being selected.

It was a stressful day for Barbara, but after much anticipation, his phone finally rang. He had been extended a bid to join the fraternity he had felt most comfortable with since the beginning of the Greek Barbecue on Monday. 

"I was very anxious the whole week," Barbara said. "This was something I really wanted to be a part of."

Finally, Greek recruitment week ended and Agustin would begin to enter FIU doors with a whole new perspective on the  true meaning of brotherhood.  

On July 17, all potential members that were extended a bid to join Sig Ep met at the Graham Center Ballrooms to officially sign their bid cards. Bid cards are used so that Greek advisors know whether a potential member has accepted a bid from a certain organization. 

"When the President of Sigma Phi Epsilon handed me that bid card, I was just really happy," Barbara said.

Although the recruitment process was long and at times a little stressful, Agustin is glad he went through it.

"It was a really good experience and I have no regrets," Barbara said. "I have made a lot of new friends."

One only hopes that those hyped misconceptions of fraternal organizations portrayed by society can be placed aside in support of Barbara's experiences. 

When it comes down to it, joining a Greek organization seems to be more of a fun rather than a tedious experience.

Headline: Charlie mixes old-fashioned sweetness with modern-day spice
Author: Sergio Carmona / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The entertainment in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is as sensational as the chocolate found in Willy Wonka's factory. 

Although Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's novel, starring Johnny Depp, is not a deliberate remake of the classic 1971 film (directed by Mel Stuart with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka and Peter Ostrum as Charlie), it still contains the same delightful storyline while taking a much more exaggerated and hysterical approach.

Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a poor boy whose family barely has enough to eat. He lives with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor) and four grandparents, including beloved Grandpa Joe (David Kelly). Bucket is a big fan of Willy Wonka, who decides to open the doors to his chocolate factory for the first time in ten years and will allow five people to join him inside for a tour.  

Wonka will be distributing five golden tickets in his packaged chocolate throughout the world and those who find the tickets will visit the factory. Customers flock to stores to get their hands on Wonka bars and then chaos erupts. Unfortunately for Charlie, he can only afford to have a bar on his birthday which turns out not to be a winner. But one day, he finds a $10 bill on the street and uses it to buy a bar, winning the opportunity of visiting Wonka's chocolate factory with his grandfather and four other unworthy winners.

Like the 1971 version, this is where the fun starts, as the film intensifies its already strong sense of whimsical fun, which Burton executes effectively. With computer generated scenes and a real factory set-up, Burton takes a different approach to incorporate the hilarious and sentimental storyline into the picture. 

Danny Elfmann's gloomy score enhances the film from the opening credits and throughout the whole film. 

Although the film's pace is a bit fast and there may be scenes that don't have time to develop, screenwriter John August fills the film with quirky, but clever lines, delivered to perfection by the actors.

Not much more can be said about the versatile Johnny Depp. Although he may appear to be overacting in this film, he gives an accurate portrayal of the eccentric and cunning character in an energetic tone, much the way Gene Wilder did as a calmer Wonka in the previous version. His chemistry with the bratty children also demonstrates Wonka's cynical and nonchalant demeanor through his tone of voice and facial expressions as the children kiss up to him in order to be chosen for his reward. 

Speaking of which, anyone who's seen the 1971 version would be happy to hear that the children are exactly the way we remember them, with a few exceptions regarding Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) and Violet Bearegarde (Annasophia Robb). Mike is still the television addict, but comes off very rude through his skeptic remarks, to which Wonka replies: "I hear mumbling." Violet, the gum-chewing record holder comes off more arrogant than in the original, often proclaiming herself a winner and the other children losers. Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) is as 



bratty and spoiled as remembered, Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) is the same fat slob and Charlie is, of course, the same sentimental innocent boy we root for.

In this version, the children's misfortunes are much more intense than the 1971 version and the lovable Oompa Loompa's traditional musical numbers are much fresher and more hysterical than before, as a different tune is presented after each misfortune. Flashbacks also provide humorous moments of Wonka's past, as well as his strained relationship with his father (Christopher Lee). Charlie's other grandparents, although minor characters, are more fleshed out and funny. However, Charlie's situation is still the heart of the story that accommodates the silly amusement.

This new ride through Willy Wonka's factory provides audiences with a fresh approach to the classic tale. This contemporary re-telling stirs the heart and tickles the funny bone.

Subheadline: Some Favorite Things
Author: Michelle Ferrer / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
1. TRAVELING
There's nothing better than sampling a bit of the world. Even though being on an airplane for more than two hours may be a pain, it's all worth it when you land in Paris and visit the Eiffel Tower while eating a crepe.

2. BOOKS
I [heart] books. I will literally lock myself up in my room for a whole day and read a book. I know you're probably saying to yourself, "Nerd alert!" but there's seriously nothing better than a well-written book. Some of my favorite books are "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" and the "Harry Potter" series. Hooray for reading!

3. "ALIAS"
 I am completely addicted to "Alias." I'm not exactly sure why, but I'm like a crack addict, constantly craving more every time an episode ends. Plus, Michael Varitan is amazingly hot.

4. CELEBRITY JEOPARDY
    "The Rapist ... no Mr. Connery, that's Therapist." I adore Will Ferrell, so what can be better than him impersonating "Jeopardy" host Alex Trebek while Sean Connery insults him with politically incorrect statements?

5. CLAM CHOWDER
 It's delightful. Enough said.

Headline: Potter ages and matures in Rowling's sixth installment of the popular fantasy series
Author: Jeniffer Galasso / Asst. Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" is one of the most enthralling books ever written. Readers are once again witnesses to J.K. Rowling's uncanny ability to keep characters fresh and vivid in our imaginations, despite it being our sixth book reading about them. In the book, we see how clearly Harry, Ron and Hermione, along with the regular gang, have all grown up. 

Harry is no longer the brooding angry teenager he was during books four and five. He has come to accept his fate head-on, and takes full on responsibility for his actions. Even though he is still fearful at times of what lies ahead in his life and the quests that he must embark on, which is normal given that he is facing You-Know-Who, he valiantly steps to the front line and demands to be kept on the inside at all times. Albus Dumbledore once again makes an influential presence in this book, even though he was absent during most of book five. 

Rowling is able to freely make an emotional impact on the reader like never before. There will be sections in which you can't help but laugh out loud. Simple teenage romance scenes that could easily be seen as silly, come off as endearing. Readers get to join in the fun behind the jealous antics and "snogging" teases that Ron, Hermoine, Ginny and Harry provoke among themselves. The twins, Fred and George, provide more tools, or rather enchantments, as entertainment for Hogwarts students. However, like all good things in life, this too must come to an end. 

Beyond the happiness and innocence in the book, there is always Lord Voldemort, who is trying his best to rise to power. He creates mystery in the book, as we find out just how he is infiltrating Hogwarts. One of the best parts of this book is that we get to know Tom Riddle before his Lord Voldemort days. Through Dumbledore's memories we read about the beginnings of the boy who would become the darkest wizard of all time. 

Certain questions are still unanswered, the biggest debate being - which side is Severus Snape on? Although the answer seems rather clear toward the end of the book, prior events and comments leave a lingering doubt in your mind, leaving no choice but to wait for the final book. 

However, it must be said that the end is an extremely sad one. Readers will grieve along with Harry the death of one of the most beloved characters in the books; one who always stood by Harry even if he doubted it at times, and someone whose belief in Harry never, not once, faltered. 

"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" creates more questions than answers for them. 

The characters are thrust into adulthood and it seems that the purpose of book seven will be to show how they deal. 

Will their friendship survive? Did he really die? And of course, who will be triumphant in the pending war - Harry Potter Lord Voldemort?

Headline: Oleta Park renovations attract students
Author: Yahnilet Colon / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Tucked away in the North Miami metropolitan area and a five-minute drive from the Biscayne Bay Campus is the Oleta River State Park, the largest urban park in the state of Florida, and future site of the Blue Marlin Fish House & Wilderness Experience. 

A recreation of the 1930s trading post, established by North Miami Beach pioneer and former mayor Daniel Diefenbach, the Blue Marlin Fish House will bring a "cultural experience to the park," according to Park Manager Steven Dale.

The original Blue Marlin Smoke House was established in 1938.

"It was originally a center for barter," Dale said. 

The smoke house was a place where people could trade their catch and anchor their boats.

"We anchor, go on boat and occasionally walk the dog," said Dan Roblee, a junior majoring in print journalism. "Kayaking is great, we go up the river."

Travel far enough into the park and the sounds of nearby Northeast 163rd Street disappear.

BBC buildings are within view of the park and the future site of the Blue Marlin Fish House & Wilderness Experience, scheduled to open by August 2005 at the same location as the original smoke house on 2500 N.E. 163rd St.

The fish house will be a three-building structure primarily composed of a nature center, a smoke house and a breezeway eating area. FIU students can enjoy smoked fish while taking in a view of  the Oleta River and local animal life, such as river otters and manatees. A kayak or canoe launch will also be available.

"It's really a reclaimed area; they're trying to restore it to a natural community," said Thomas Pliske, an environmental science professor. "It's a multiple-use park."

Aside from the boating and peaceful attraction of the park, Oleta also has a man-made beach, bike trails, picnic areas and air-conditioned cabins available for rental.

The historical aspect of the park, the original Blue Marlin Smoke House and the North Miami area will be a large focus of the new fish house.

"The breezeway will contain environmental displays, some with trivia," said Park Services Specialist Laura Kruger. 

According to Kruger, the educational center will contain casings of Indian artifacts and pictures of historical occurrences tied to the smoke house site, including the frequent visits from former President John F. Kennedy and the use of the Oleta River for hiding American boats from German U-boats during World War II. There will also be a computer with various educational presentations.

"These historical elements are why we need state parks," Pliske said.

The Florida Inland Navigation District provided part of the $1.2 million funding for the Blue Marlin Fish House.

Roblee, who frequents the area with his girlfriend and other buddies agreed: "I like history, so I'd like to check it out."

Volunteers are welcome to participate in the late summer opening.

"You can get out of the city and relax," Kruger said.

Headline: Board of Governors meet at UP
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Members of the Florida Board of Governors met with the presidents of the state's universities at University Park campus on July 20 and 21 to discuss different proposals and educational challenges. Among them was the continuing debate over the establishment of medical schools or new medical programs.

In a round-table discussion conducted by the BOG's Subcommittee on Medical Education,  representatives from the Council for Education Policy Research and Improvement presented a PowerPoint slide show outlining solutions to what they describe as a shortage of doctors in the state of Florida.

Though FIU and the University of Central Florida have hopes of opening their own medical school programs in order to train the needed doctors, the CEPRI report stated that the best solution would be to "first pursue a policy of creating and expanding medical residency positions in the state."

"Although we've known that increasing the number of doctors in residence training could be the best solution, our problem continues to be the finances," said Bernard Machen, president of University of Florida. "If we have those residencies we can bring the doctors, but who will fund us?"

Federal allocations for new residencies have been inactive since 1997 and have prohibited the expansion of the programs in places like the University of Florida and the University of South Florida. It currently takes $100,000 to support one resident student, most of which is spent on sky-rocketing malpractice insurance fees.

"If we don't deal with the problem surrounding residencies, we'll be spending an exorbitant amount of money on opening these new programs and teaching students that will just end up leaving the state," said BOG Chair Gerri Moll. 

As the discussion shifted from residencies to the possibility of establishing new medical schools, Subcommittee Co-Chair John Temple allowed FIU President Modesto A. Maidique to discuss the development of the university's proposals on the subject.

"We've been perfecting, improving and working on the [medical school] proposal," Maidique said. "I'm ready to present whenever the Chair gives me a meeting date."

Although Maidique had been scheduled to submit a preliminary proposal to the BOG last November, delays within the meeting forced the date to be moved to Jan. 27. The final proposal day has now been set for Nov. 17 at the University of North Florida. The final decision as to whether FIU will receive approval for the long-awaited medical school will be announced at that time.

UCF will also deliver its final statements on that date.

However, not everyone at the meeting was happy with the attention that the possibility of new medical programs received.

"I thought this meeting was arranged to discuss the necessity of medical schools, not to start turning in proposals," said Zach Zachariah, a subcommittee co-chair, toward the end of the discussions.

While proposing that the best way to deal with the shortage of doctors would be to expand already existing programs, Zachariah still showed skepticism toward the report and its findings.

"When Florida wants medical schools, they make up a crisis. The crisis is started by you, by people who want medical schools," he said, causing a slight commotion among those present.

Near the meeting's conclusion, the members began to address the trouble with funds for residencies once again, asserting that this was the only way to fix the problem.

"We need to be bold, we need to dig in and we need to lobby the right people, both at the state and federal levels for the right funds," said BOG member Bill McCullum. "That's the only way."

Other meetings that took place during the conference included a gathering of the BOG Finance Committee and an assembly of provosts and presidents from the universities in attendance.

The BOG meets at various state campuses throughout the year, usually holding 10 annual conferences. The next meeting will take place in September at UCF.

Headline: Officer Currie arrested for sexual assault
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Miami-Dade Police arrested FIU police officer Frederick Currie on July 20 and charged him with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman, officials said. 

The arrest occurred 12 days after Currie was placed on administrative leave with pay pending an investigation. 

The incident took place around 2 a.m. on July 8 when the on-duty Currie approached a seemingly suspicious vehicle on the grounds of Tamiami Park.  

According to Miami-Dade Police spokeswoman Nelda Fonticiella, Currie approached the vehicle and saw a woman and her boyfriend inside the car. He ordered the woman out of the vehicle and sexually assaulted her.  

The victim was not an FIU student. 

Currie, 35, is being charged with one count of sexual battery and one count of battery. As of July 22, Currie was still being detained at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on a $500,000 bond. 

This brush with the law is not the first for Currie. Personnel records obtained by The Beacon indicate that Currie has twice been fired from FIU, reprimanded once, repeatedly suspended or relieved of duty and arrested three times on domestic violence charges off-campus while working for the university. 

The personnel file also indicates that after his second arrest, the university learned that he had also been accused of domestic violence while he was with the Marine Corps before joining the FIU police department. 

Currie is still currently under employment at the university. 

"With him being charged, nothing actually changes. He remains on administrative leave with pay," said Director of Media Relations Mark Riordan. "We cannot begin our internal affairs investigation until the completion of the criminal and judicial processes." 

FIU was forced to reinstate Currie both times he was fired after an independent arbitrator reviewed his cases. He is part of The Police Benevolent Association - the union he used to appeal his cases. 

"We believe we spoke clearly by firing him twice," Riordan said.

Headline: FIU places second in international advertising competition
Author: Damian Grass / Asst. News Editor
&nbsp;
 An FIU team of advertising students came in second place in the International Advertising Association's InterAd IX international challenge to help web portal Yahoo! reach teenagers.

 The team, named "Sneakers and Suits Communications," advanced to the world finals as the winner of the United States and Canada InterAd competition. The competition, among 39 student teams from 25 schools across 16 countries, is an extension of the American Advertising Federation's well-respected National Student Advertising Competition in the United States. Sneakers and Suits' project was based on research the team conducted with South Florida 13-to 17-year-olds. 

The result was a campaign that rewarded teenagers with gifts for registering for the different Yahoo! services. The team, which consisted of Joann Chea, Everett Guerny, Melissa Gutierrez, Paola Lopes, all majoring in advertising, and Stephanie Leavitt majoring in public relations, and led by faculty advisor Rosanna M. Fiske, provided judges with a study that pointed to exactly what would motivate people in that target age group.

 That research is exactly what made the project stand out. "FIU's Sneakers & Suits did an exceptionally fine job interpreting today's American teens," said John H. Holmes, IAA director of educational programs & alliances. Holmes also noted that based on its research, Sneakers & Suits' carefully targeted multimedia campaign, complete with highly creative messages that reward viewers, should resonate well with the target audience.

 Although The World Champion title went to Charles Sturt University in Australia, Sneakers and Suits Communications was the first team to break new grounds for FIU. 

"We don't have a history of participation in this competition, so to compete and place this high makes us absolutely delighted and so proud," said School of Journalism and Mass Communication Dean Lillian Kopenhaver. "This was a team of highly talented and well-prepared students."

Headline: Plame scandal shakes the White House
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"I have nothing but contempt and anger for those who betray the trust by exposing the name of our sources. They are, in my view, the most insidious of traitors."
-Former President George H.W. Bush, April 26, 1999.

Unless you live under a rock, surely you have heard about the jailing of New York Times columnist Judith Miller for her refusal to reveal her White House sources to federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald has been investigating the leak of former undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame for the past two years.

For those unfamiliar with the case, a quick summary: In an attempt to validate a State of the Union claim that Iraq sought to obtain yellowcake uranium from Niger, the White House sent former ambassador Joseph Wilson to Africa to investigate the claim. 

In a New York Times article, Wilson essentially dismantled the claim and embarrassed the Bush administration. Shortly thereafter, columnist Robert Novak suggested that Plame may have gotten her husband, Wilson, the assignment; thereby questioning the truthfulness of Wilson's findings. The Novak article, written in July 2003, is the chief culprit in revealing Plame's identity to the public. It should be noted that Plame was working as an analyst in the CIA's Doctorate of Operations counterproliferation division.

The disclosure of a covert government official is a federal crime, which makes Fitzgerald's findings extremely important. What makes this situation even more dramatic is that it has come to center on an essential member of the Bush administration, Karl Rove. Rove, a.k.a. "Bush's Brain," has been almost singularly responsible for Bush's 2000 and 2004 victories and recently took the position of deputy chief of staff in the administration. Additionally, he is a personal friend of Bush, whose ties to the president extend back to the 1970s. There is probably  no other individual the president holds in higher regard.

Shortly after Fitzgerald's investigation began, Bush took the initiative to proclaim that if anyone within his administration was responsible for leaking Plame's identity, that individual would be removed at once. No one forced him to come forward with this statement. It was Bush's attempt to take a bold, affirmative stance in a criminal investigation. 

Not surprisingly, since the attention has turned to Rove, Bush has changed his tune. He insisted he would only remove any person indicted, tried and convicted "of a crime" in Plame's outing. It now appears that putting Plame and American interests at danger is not punishable in Bush's mind. It only matters if you get caught.

Time reporter Matthew Cooper just recently acknowledged that Rove was the secret source who informed him that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA. 

In an email to Michael Duffy, Time bureau chief, Cooper wrote, "[I] spoke to Rove on double super secret background for about two minutes." He went on to write: "It was ... Wilson's wife, who apparently works at the agency on weapons of mass destruction issues, who authorized the trip." 

Whichever way you look at it, that my friends, is a leak. Although most Republicans insist no law was broken because Rove did not mention Plame by name, it doesn't take a government official to do a little searching to find that Wilson is married to Valerie Plame. Anyone could find that information through the Internet now-a-days.

Although I hardly ever find myself agreeing with Bush, I must say I whole heartedly agree with former President Bush's aforementioned comment. In fact, I also agree with former Republican Party Chairman Ed Gillespie. On September 30, 2003, he stated that the revealing of Plame's identity is "abhorrent and it should be a crime." Asked by Hardball's Chris Matthews if it would be worse than Watergate, he answered, "Yeah, in terms of the real world implications of it."

These men seemed to understand the danger an undercover agent faces, should the agents identity's be disclosed - not to mention the damage done to U.S. interests. Unfortunately it seems that the Bush administration cannot come to the same conclusion. The man who swore to always bring justice and integrity into the Oval Office (in a cheap shot at former President Bill Clinton) now is failing to not only bring terrorists to justice, but to bring those within his own administration to justice. Exactly how is that supposed to make us safer? We know Osama Bin Laden is responsible for 9/11 and we now know Karl Rove directly threatened a CIA agent and American national security, and neither has faced any justice from this administration. 

However, since Saddam Hussein, who posed no direct threat to the United States is locked up, the White House insists it is doing its job of keeping us safe. I can only speak for myself, but that does not make one ounce of sense.

Make no mistake about it: The leaking of Plame's identity was politics at its most thuggish. Rove abused the "anonymous source" privilege to enact revenge on a man who rightly called into question the reasoning for the invasion of Iraq. This is just another example of how this administration smears all those who voice their doubts on its policies. 

Now that the White House has gotten caught with its pants down in this one, Americans receive another opportunity to gauge whether Bush and his administration will ever show a shred of integrity and do what it initially promised to do. Given its track record, there's a better chance O.J. Simpson will find his ex-wife's killer before that happens.

Subheadline: Former student feels unsafe at FIU after police officer's sexual assault charges 
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As an FIU graduate and current FIU employee, I am appalled that a member of the FIU community would commit such an act, let alone an FIU police officer. I lived for four years on the University Park campus and relied on FIU police to keep me safe. 

One of the highlights of living at FIU was that there were Florida State police officers on campus 24/7. I no longer feel safe. I feel violated by what has happened. Does it matter that the girl was not an FIU student or employee? I do not believe it makes any difference. It was still one of FIU's officers and not only that, but he was on duty at the time. 

Officer Frederick Currie was supposed to be protecting FIU's campus when the event transpired.

 I no longer feel I can trust and confide in FIU's police officers. I believe FIU students have a right to know what this police officer looks like, so they are fully aware of what is walking around our campus. If alleged sex offenders have their faces plastered in newspapers and on the Miami-Dade government website, so should Currie. Students need to stand up for their rights and their safety. If students were to speak up, I'm sure an act, such as the one in which Officer Currie is accused of, would not occur again. 

FIU is a university, a place of higher learning, not a place to be feared.

Headline: Women's soccer captain has motivation to overcome career setbacks
Author: Gabriel Medina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Senior Nastassia Rodriguez, a center midfielder and captain of the women's soccer team, believes that life is all about the obstacles you face, and the lessons you learn from them. 

Rodriguez began playing soccer when she was 11-years-old and has been a steady player, and steady student ever since. 

Two major soccer-related injuries have plagued her since the start of high school.

As a freshman in high school, Rodriguez had surgery on her right knee. 

"That was my fist surgery," she said. "The doctors told me that I would be back [to normal] eight weeks [after the surgery]. I got back in six and started for the varsity team as a freshman in high school. That was a very big accomplishment."

Rodriguez had surgery on her left ear a few years later, which left her 75 percent deaf in that ear. 

"These experiences have opened my eyes a lot," Rodriguez said. 

Despite this, Rodriguez said she has been able to keep her faith. As her father Felipe, 46, said: "Things happen in life that we don't understand. It's important [for us] to keep faith in God."

Though many people told her not to push herself too hard for fear that she would injure herself further, Rodriguez remained persistent. 

"I love [soccer]," she said. "I can get injured just as much while driving a car down the street. Why not do what I love?"

By her own admittance, Rodriguez isn't the star player of the soccer team. However, the girl who drives around in a bulky Ford F350 has a unique form of motivation.

"My best friend passed away when I was sixteen," Rodriguez said. "She taught me to live life while you can because it's too short." 

Maria Kassab, Nastassia's friend, was diagnosed with cancer when the two were 12-years-old. 

Felipe Rodriguez played soccer when he was younger and enlisted his daughter at the Coral Gables Youth Center when she was 11 years old. Nastassia has not regretted it one bit. 

"I'm the soccer player that I am today because soccer [was almost] taken away from me," she said. "I've had a lot of injuries that have opened my eyes and made me see that soccer is a privilege that allows you to use your body [competitively]. It's a privilege to be able to run and pass."

Rodriguez has a love for many other things other than soccer. "I especially love roller coasters." 

Felipe Rodriguez said his daughter plans to earn a racing license after college. 

"She enjoys racing, as do I and her brother, Felipe, Jr. [Nastassia and her brother] drive really fast! [Nastassia] has always been a strong-willed girl," her father said.

Rodriguez called herself a "stable student athlete." She currently maintains a 3.0 cumulative GPA. 

"It's tough maintaining [my grades] because of athletics," she said. "Student athletes have to do everything a student does, plus everything that an athlete has to do. It's a rigorous schedule." 

Rodriguez also joked that she has become a pro in time management.

"Nastassia [was] in the gifted program in elementary school, middle school and high school," her father said. 

She made the varsity soccer team during her freshmen year at Coral Gables Senior High School and helped the Cavaliers to four district championships, two GMAC titles, a pair of regional championships and to a state runner-up finish in 2000. 

During Fall semester of 2002, Rodriguez attended Appalachian State University on a soccer scholarship, but transferred to FIU to play soccer in her hometown and to be closer to her family.

The 21-year-old center midfielder is currently studying international business, but admitted that she did not know what she wanted to do with the degree. 

"[All I know] is that whatever I do in life, I'm going to be happy," Rodriguez said. "If tomorrow I feel like going to Europe, then I'm going to go."

Despite her resolute nature, Felipe Rodriguez does not worry about his daughter. He and wife Veronica allowed Nastassia and her own decisions as they were growing up so that they would learn the consequences of making wrong choices early in life.

"Life is just a big school year," Nastassia Rodriguez said. "Life is full of experiences and that's what makes you who you are." 

Just as no one was worried about Rodriguez when the subject turned to education, no one seems to worry about her when it turns to the rest of her life. Because whatever happens to her, she is always prepared to learn.

Headline: Coach speaks out on Lowell
Subheadline: COMMENTARY
Author: Danny Price / FIU Baseball Coach
&nbsp;
While I am not a frequent listener to sports talk radio, the innuendos and whispers defaming the reputation of the Florida Marlins' Mike Lowell are deafening.

I have known Mike as both a college and professional athlete and can vouch for his character as sterling. 

Mike's commitment to the South Florida community through his philanthropic and humanitarian efforts is exemplary, while his real-life victory over testicular cancer has been well documented.

The great Ted Williams once said that hitting a baseball being hurled up to 100 miles per hour is the single hardest thing to do in all of sports. 

It is only natural then, that Major League Baseball players, like all of us in everyday life, go through ups and downs in our performance levels.

If you were fortunate enough to know his wife and parents, you would realize that Mike Lowell is a quality human being. 

To give up on an athlete and person of his caliber, or to believe that his performance this season is linked in any way to any unnatural substances, is just preposterous.

Headline: Offensive lineman admired for toughness
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
There's a reason why center Victor Cernius has been named the Golden Panther's football team Iron Man for two consecutive years. With a 6-4, 290 pound frame, the third year center has started every game for FIU in his career.

Cernius has been a focal point of the offensive line and is rated as the No. 32 center in Division I by Phil Steele's 2005 College Football Preview. In 2003, the lineman finished with 755 snaps and no penalties called against him.

Coming out of Tampa Catholic High School with a school record 1,085 pound leg press, Cernius dominated the prep league with offensive MVP honor's his senior year and by participating in the All-Hillsborough Country all-star game. In high school, he was also a member of the National Honors Society and a Bright Futures Scholar.

Q: What can fans expect from the football team this year after two disappointing seasons?

From the fans' perspective they don't see what we see. We are expecting a tougher competition, but from us, fans can expect much more leadership and commitment. We should be able to close out games and have a chance at the Sun Belt Championship.

Q: Everyone knows coach Don Strock, the football player and coach. What type of person is he when football is not involved?

He's a very laid back person and a nice guy. He's also always dressed in golf attire.

Q: How have you been able to start and play in every game for the past three seasons?

I guess I've been lucky - I haven't gotten hurt. Me and some other guys also spend more time in the weight room. Maybe that helps with injuries.

Q: What's a typical workout at the gym for you?

All season I lift four days a week, but in season I lighten the load. I can bench 400 pounds max and 27 times at 225 pounds. I squat 550 pounds.

Q: People don't know the beating your arms, fingers and legs take during a football game. How does your body feel the day after a game?

Every part of your body hurts after a game and your hands definitely get a beating. Physically, I wear gloves to minimize cuts, I don't wear gloves in my right hand 'cause I snap the football and that hand is scared up. By the end of the season, I have pieces of my hand missing. 

Q: You were on the university's dean list last semester. How important is it for you to not only excel on the field but also in the classroom?

It's the most important to me; football will always be there but that degree will set you up for the rest of your life.

Q: Linemen are typically known to eat massive amounts of food - more than the usual football player. What's the craziest amount of food you and your teammates have eaten?

The second year I was here, the entire offensive line went to Kings Buffet (Chinese place). We went there around seven and pretty much closed the place down by ourselves. I've never seen faces like that of the people that were there. We cleaned the place out.

Q: In high school, you held the record with a leg press of 1,085 pounds. What motivates you to do this kind of weight?

It's important to me, I just compete against myself. If I don't hit what I should in the weight room, I get disappointed in myself.

Q: If your house was on fire and you could only go back and get three material things - assuming your family is safe - what would you get?

Probably a photo album, my computer because it has lots of schoolwork there and some clothes I guess, 'cause I would probably need some.

Q: Would you shed three years of your life for an NCAA title with FIU?

Yes because that's what I've dreamed of since [I was] little. I would do it without a question.

Q: What are the best and worst things of FIU?

The best is probably the diversity the university has. The bad is that the university is not mature for its size. FIU is constructing so much stuff so quickly. The campus looks totally different than when I got here. I can't imagine the university being able to run everything so fast.

Q: The team travels on a charter plane to every game. What's the best part of traveling with all your teammates together?

The thing I like best is the focus we have as a team. From the time we are on the bus to the airport, to when we arrive to the city we are going to play at, the mentality is all football. 

The worst thing about it, though, is the small seats on the plane. I'm a big guy so the small seats on a long ride are not too good.

Headline: Men's soccer announces 2005 season schedule
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Men's soccer coach Karl Kremser announced his team's 2005 season schedule on July 18. 

The schedule has the Golden Panthers playing 17 regular season games that include a nine-game conference schedule. 

They also play seven games against teams that advanced to the 2004 NCAA Tournament.

"It is a challenging schedule to say the least," said coach Kremser, who is entering his 26th season coaching the team. "It is certainly in keeping with tradition since we usually play a tough schedule. But now that we are competing in one of the premier soccer conferences in the country, coupled with the fact we have such a young team, makes it even more difficult. It will be a tremendous challenge, yet a tremendous opportunity at the same time."

The men's soccer team is nine wins shy of the program's 400th victory and will be joining Conference USA as an associate member. 

The program was part of the Atlantic Soccer Conference for the past five seasons and enjoyed much success, including four conference titles, three conference Players of the Year and 32 all-conference selections.

Kentucky and South Carolina will join FIU as associate members of Conference USA for men's soccer as well. 

University of Alabama at Birmigham, Central Florida, East Carolina, Marshall, Memphis, Southern Methodist and Tulsa are members of the conference in all intercollegiate sports.

 The teams will play a nine-match round-robin schedule. The top eight finishers in the regular season will qualify for November's conference tournament.

Conference USA also features four of the NCAA's top - 10 winningest active soccer coaches in SMU's Schellas Hyndman, South Carolina's Mark Berson, Marshall's Bob Gray and FIU's Kremser.

The conference also features six teams that advanced to the 2004 NCAA Tournament - FIU, SMU, South Carolina, UCF, Memphis and Tulsa.

The Golden Panthers will open the regular season on the road against South Florida on Sept. 2. Their home opener is set for the very next day against Missouri State. 

Their inaugural Conference USA match will be at home Sept. 30, versus Kentucky.

The Golden Panthers will also play in two in-season tournaments. The FIU Diadora Classic at the University Park campus, from Sept. 16 through Sept. 18, will feature Florida Atlantic, Alabama A&M and Xavier. 

They will then go west for the SCU/USF Adidas Classic from Sept. 23 through Sept. 25 to face 2004 NCAA Tournament qualifiers Santa Clara and San Francisco.

The men's soccer team finished the 2004 season with an 11-7 record and its fourth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. 

The team returns five starters from last season: forward Carron Williams, who was the team's leading scorer in 2004 and an NSCAA/Adidas All-South Second Team selection, goalie Shawn Crowe and midfielders Lucas Scudeler,  Jared Rose and Jean Camere.

Dear Beacon Staff, my name is Emerio Diaz Jr. and I am an avid reader of The Beacon. However, for the past two weeks and most of last semester on the Opinion Page there were articles that were vehemently against our sitting US President. I know the author well (James Valle), as he is a friend of mine. What I suggest that you do is get someone else to write the flip-side of what James is saying. Sort of like a Point v. Counterpoint. I think that that will make it more appealing to the reader. From my understanding FIU is not ALL on the political left.

Thank you,
Emerio Diaz Jr.

Hello, I am just writing to inform that I was very pleased to see a section dedicated to Miami night life last week. Both articles were very well planned out and I thought the ideas delivered were thorough. I would like to thank Ms. Iser and Mr. Alvarez for showing me where to go to have a great time and how to look good at the same time. This is the kind of thing readers want and I'm sure the feedback for your section has been positive and I hope it's not the last time I see something like this in The Beacon. Good job, and I can't wait to continue reading in the fall.
