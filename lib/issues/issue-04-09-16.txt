Headline: Men's soccer pulls  upset over Tar Heels,  loses to Wake Forest

FIU 3, NORTH  CAROLINA 2 

With a 3-2 victory  over North Carolina  during the Nike Classic, the Golden Panthers opened the season  pretty much the same  way the 2003 finished- winning. 

The Tar Heels went  in the game ranked No.  7 in the nation but FIU  was able to squeeze out  the victory in double  time on a goal by Lucus  Scudeler. 

With the victory,  Coach Karl Kremser  picked up his 300th victory with FIU and 313  overall. For Kremser,  the victory as a team was  more important. 

"It was a huge game  to beat somebody of that  stature on their field. They  were the pre-season team  to win the ACC, which is  considered the top conference," said Kremser. "It  was very big for us." 

North Carolina opened  the game strong with forward Jamie Watson scoring the first goal of the  game at the 38th minute  of the first half. Watson  later scored a second goal  in the beginning minutes  of the second half giving  UNC a 2-0 lead. 

Allen Handy put FIU  on the scoreboard in the  60th minute un an unassisted goal. Jared Rose tied  the score at minute 74 on  an assist by Luis Perea. The Golden Panthers  outshot Carolina 13-9 in  the game and 3-0 in overtime. Goalkeeper Shawn  Crowe finished the game  with two saves. 

Kremser was pleased  with the play of Crowe  who did not play a single  minute last year. 

"Crowe was outstanding for us, he played  extremely well," Kremser  said.

WAKE FOREST 3, FIU 2  

Kremer's team could  not make it two wins in  a row as the team fell  to No.5 Wake Forest a  day after upsetting North  Carolina. 

The Deamon Decons  came from behind to  defeat FIU in overtime. 

Fernando Plentz scored  the first goal of the game  for FIU at minute 22.12  on an assist by Pierre  Ho'Sang. WF tallied back  by adding back-to-back  goals in the second half,  both by Scott Sealy. 

With WF leading 2-1  with five minutes to go,  Carron Williams put FIU  back in the game to send  it into overtime.

FIU couldn't defeat  Wake Forest in overtime  as they had done the night  before against North Carolina.  

Sealy once against came  through for the Deamon  Deacons with an assist  leading to a goal by Justin  Moose five minutes into  overtime. Playing its second game of the season on backto-back nights, Kremser  admits that it was a lot of  the players to handle. 

"We weren't physically  ready to go back to back.  We had our chances but we  didn't look as quick as we  did against North Carolina," Kremser said. 

Despite the fatigue, the  Golden Panthers took the  game into overtime against  one of the top teams in the  country. 

"It was discouraging  to lose in overtime. If you  had told me before the  tournament we would  win one of two, I would  have been happy winning  one and losing one. It was  pretty significant what our  kids did," Kremser said.

Headline: Tabor provides spark off bench
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU is down 16-3 with  9:47 left in the game and  its hopes of winning the  first game of the season  are vanishing.  

Looking for a change,  Coach Don Strock uses  a technique he mastered  in the NFL: play another  quarterback when the  first stringer is struggling. 

Strock, a long time  Miami Dolphin, would  sometimes be inserted  into the game during  his NFL career when the  starter was struggling.  

Using that experience,  Strock decided it was time  to insert David Tabor  against Youngstown this  past Saturday night. 

Tabor, the first Golden  Panther to sign to play  under Strock in 2000,  saw the opportunity as a  chance to help his team  make a comeback victory. 

"I knew we had over  nine minutes and after I  completed the first pass,  then the second, I started  to feel it a bit. I saw it in  the guy's eyes and I knew  we had a chance," said  Tabor. "When we scored I  knew we still had to score  more, but that was the first  time people knew, 'hey, we  are still in this.'" 

Despite the weight of  knowing FIU is downand in need of a couple of  touchdowns, Tabor didn't  feel the pressure.

"Josh [Patrick] came  out  field  and,  coach [Strock] told me, 'Dave  get loose.' My heart was  not beating fast, I was  calm," Tabor said. "I was  not nervous at all." 

With the crowd of the  Lions cheering the team  on, Tabor focused on the  game and ignored everything else around him  before hiking the ball. 

"Football is a game of  reaction and you can't  think. When you say 'hut,'  you better be ready," said  Tabor.  

Tabor completed 15 of  22 passes for 174 yards and  three touchdowns. With  back to back passes leading the Golden Panther on  scoring drives, Tabor never  once told his teammates  in the huddle anything  inspirational to hype them  up. He let the game speak  for itself. 

"I never said 'come on  guys we can do this.' I got  the play, called it, and ran  it. They know what I am  capable of it's good they  have confidence in me,"  said Tabor who was proud  the team didn't give up  and kept fighting back. 

Once the game was  over, Tabor felt good  inside that Strock made  the call to put him in the  game. 

"He told me, 'great  job.' You know that's what  I used to do my younger  days for the Dolphins.'  For him to put me in the  game, and trust me, that  makes me feel good,"  Tabor said. 

Despite saving the game  for FIU, Tabor insists there  is no quarterback controversy and Josh Patrick  is still the starter of the  team. 

"There is no controversy, Josh is our man,  right now. He's working  with first team and me  with second and third  team. That could have  easily been Jaime too, we  don't know who Strock  will call for," Tabor said. 

With FIU shifting to  Division I-A this season,  Tabor hopes the victory  will bring more fans to the  stands. 

"It was a big victory  and we were all excited. It  was the first overtime win,  the first win over a scholarship team and the first on  the road." 

"We're making the  jump to I-A,  and that  win showed our character,  and hopefully it will give  us more fans," said Tabor  who encourages fans to  bring their aunt, grandma,  uncle, etc to games in  order to give the team  support.

Headline: Smith boosts FIU receiving corps in 4th quarter
Subheadline: Tight end sets school record with  ten catches in first game of season
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panther receiving corps found a new weapon in  its already loaded arsenal. Tight  end Samuel Smith, replacing  the injured Joe Struyf, exploded  into his starting role through  one of the most impressive performances by an FIU football  player to date.  

Smith, who spent most of  last season on the bench, will be  receiving a lot more attention  from opposing defenses after  becoming the first Golden Panther to catch ten receptions in a  single game.  

His 131 yards and one touchdown helped ice the YSU Penguins in Florida International's  first-ever win away from FIU  Stadium.  

The 6-foot-3, 253-pound  sophomore is a prototypical tight  end who can flatten defenders or  catch passes over their heads.  To state it simply, he is the kind  of physical presence that can  own the field between the hash  marks.  

"Basically, I block first, catch  second," Smith said of his style  of play. "I feel like I'm too fast  for linebackers and too big for  safeties and corners. That's what  I've been working hard towards,  keeping my speed up." 

As a freshman, he saw limited  playing time through 11 games,  starting just once, against Holy  Cross.  

"My first year was a learning  process for me," he added. "I  wanted to play as a freshman,  and I worked hard but didn't  get my chance. I just had to keep  working hard and waiting for my  opportunity to come."  

Sam played iron-man football  at Gulliver Prep, starting on both  offense and defense for the Raiders. Sitting on the bench was  something new to him.  

"There was a lot of frustration. I even cried because I  wanted to play. In high school, I  was used to always being on the  field," Smith said. 

All Sam did when he got his  chance was play a principle role  in his team's milestone victory,  quickly becoming David Tabor's  favorite fourth quarter target.  

Tabor was brought in to  the game with 9:48 remaining  in place of Josh Padrick. He  executed a 92-yard drive that  culminated in a 12-yard touchdown pass to Smith.  

The tight end made another  crucial catch in overtime that  set up the game winning touchdown pass to James Williams.   He attributes his performance  to hard work and diligent study  of YSU's game film. 

"I studied a lot more on them  than I have before," Smith said.  "I took a tape to my room and  sat there watching the type of  defense they were running. I saw  how they were bumping guys at  the line and practiced working  on it with our guys. I worked  hard to get open in that game  and I guess I was successful."  

The frustration of being a  back up is no longer an issue. If  Smith continues to improve, he  will not only receive more passes,  but more notice from the media  and pro scouts.  

It's an old football clich√©,  but the game is starting to slow  down for the big guy and in  a pass-happy offense like Don  Strock's, he'll get plenty of  opportunities to demonstrate  his ability.  

Like all good pass-catchers,  Smith wants the ball in his hands,  but his skill as a blocker along  with the receiving talent on the  team means he can contribute  on just about every play.  

He will garner plenty of attention from the opposition, while  opening the game up for the  entire offense, especially on a  team that likes to run a two tight  end formation.  

True, it's only the first game  of the season, but it's an important one. If the record-setting  performance is any indication,  Smith will be a nightmare for  opposing linebackers and safeties  for years to come.

Headline: Volleyball ends five game losing  streak defeating SELU 3-1
Author: Henry Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
SELU 3, FIU 0

The Golden Panthers  lost on Friday Sept. 10,  but at least found a potential star in the process.  German freshman and  tournament MVP, Ruth  Fleming played sensationally throughout the weekend.  

Her 22 kills were a  game high, to go along  with four aces.  

Without a doubt, it was  an impressive debut. Fleming was inactive during the  season's first four games,  but got plenty of playing  time during this weekend's  Wyndham Invitational  where FIU lost the first  game 3-1 to Southeastern  Louisiana. 

However, the dominant  numbers by players were  overshadowed by the fifth  straight loss. Even though  other Golden Panthers  contributed as well, the  Southeastern Louisiana  Lions prevailed in dominant fashion.  

Anna Dmoska added  18 kills and 10 digs but it  was overshadowed by the  Golden Panther's blunders  (17 service errors) or the  Lion's constant scoring.  

The Lions were led  Keri Hamblin and Juliana  Neves who had 14 kills  apiece.    

FIU lost the first game  30-26 but bounced back  to win the second 30-26.  FIU was unable to win  another set by losing the  third 30-21, and the fourth  was 30-27. By taking three  out of four sets, the Lions  increased their season win  total to five. FIU's win  total remains at zero. 

FIU 3, SELU 01

The Golden Panthers  flipped the script on Saturday. The Lions defeated  FIU in the first set 30-23,  but FIU bounced back  and got its first win of the  season en route to a 3-1  victory over Southeastern  Louisiana.  

The Lions had pounded  the Panthers 3-1 the day  before, and were looking for the tournament  sweep. 

FIU made adjustments  in the second game in  order to defeat the Lions. 

"On Friday they were  playing good defense and  Saturday we picked up  everything. Thanks to our  defense and passing that's  how we won the game,"  said dig specialist Carolina.  Cano who finished the  game with 10 digs. 

Sets two, three and  four, the team committed less errors than any  other matches during the  season.  

Anna Dmoska led FIU  finishing with a double  double with 15 kills and  16 digs. Alyse Santisi also  helped with a doubledouble of her own.  

Tournament  MVP,  Ruth Flemig, in just the  second game of her collegiate career had over  20 kills.  

The girls stopped the  bleeding by putting an end  to a season-opening five  game losing streak. The  Golden Panthers defeated  the Lions with scores  3022, 30-23, and 30-22  in the second, third and  fourth set respectively.  

The girls were excited  to win the first game of  the season. 

"It felt so good. We feel  that the team is actually  getting to play better,"  Cano said. 

Cano and the team now  knows what it takes to  win. 

"Smart hitting and consistent passing is what will  get you victories in volleyball," Cano added. 

Even though the weekend invitational was cut  short, three Golden Panthers were still recognized  and placed on the alltournament team: Santisi,  Dmoska, Dyionna Smith  and MVP Flemig. 

The Golden Panthers  cancelled games against  St. John's and Stetson was  cancelled in response to  the hurricane warning.  

Another  match  on  Friday against Southeastern Louisiana was also cancelled for the same reason.  As a result, no tournament  champion was crowned.  

On the bright side, the  shortened schedule will  allow the players to keep  their legs fresh and prepare  for the upcoming Buckeye  Classic.  

The Golden Panthers  will face Ohio State and  Montana State on Friday  Sept. 17, and Northeastern on Saturday Sept. 18. Tabor throws three touchdowns

Headline: Football makes fourth quarter comeback
Subheadline: FIU picks up first  ever road victory
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers opened  the season in Stambaugh Stadium Saturday night in search  of their first-ever road win.  Thanks to a Don Strock-like  performance from quarterback  David Tabor and a record-setting night by TE Sammy Smith,  the search is over.  

FIU overcame a 13-3 third  quarter deficit in the Ice Castle  en route to a 22-16 overtime  win over the Penguins. Tabor  led the team to a fourth quarter  comeback with an impressive 15of-22, 3 touchdown relief effort,  stepping in for Josh Padrick. 

The Triumph also marks the  first FIU win over a scholarship  opponent, first in overtime and  first over a member of the Gateway Conference, having dropped  previous contests to Western  Kentucky and Indiana State. 

The Penguins entered the  game with an impressive athome record of 110 wins and  37 losses, winning 76 percent  of their home games through  22 seasons. Most of those were  attributed to former Head Coach  Jim Tressel, now in control of  the Ohio State Buckeyes.  

John Heacock is at the helm  of the Penguins entering his  fourth season. His team, looked  poised to add win number 111  during the first half as they controlled the time of possession  and effectively moved the ball. 

The Golden Panthers had the  first opportunity at to get on the  scoreboard, but Adam Moss' 33yard field goal attempt in the first  quarter missed wide left. YSU  took advantage, answering with  a ten play, 50-yard scoring drive  resulting in a 47-yard field goal  by sophomore kicker Nick Terracina, making it 3-0 Penguins.  

"We didn't do a whole lot  right in the first half," said Head  Coach Strock. "We had some  opportunities to make big plays  and we didn't. They're a well  coached football team and were  very fortunate to get out of here  with a win." 

In the following drive, running back Rashod Smith, starting in his first game for FIU  since being sidelined by injury  in October of last year, fumbled  a pass reception that was recovered by teammate Cory McKinney. Two plays later, Smith (16  carries, 55 yards on the night)  fumbled again, this time turning  the ball over to YSU. 

The Penguins capitalized  with a nine-play and 59-yard  drive that ended with the lone  YSU touchdown of the game.  Second-year freshman quarterback Tom Zetts found fullback  Demetrius Ison in the end zone  for a 7-yard touchdown connection. Zetts completed 17-of-32  passes for 168 yards and a touchdown on the night. Terracina  added another three-pointer,  hitting from 32 yards out with  one second left in the half, giving  the Peguins a 13-0 advantage. 

Sophomore running back  Monquantae Gibson tallied 122  yards and a 5.5 per carry average on 22 rushing attempts for  the Penguins. Meanwhile, the  FIU offense seemed unable to  move the ball. QB Josh Padrick,  starting in his second season for  the Golden Panthers, finished  17-of-36 for 168 yards and no  touchdowns while repeatedly  overthrowing receivers.  

The second half was a completely different football game  as the Golden Panthers made the FOOTBALL, from page 12 right halftime adjustments.  A bend-but-don't-break  defensive mentality and  a more creative offensive  scheme paved the way for  FIU's first fourth quarter  comeback.  

"When we blitzed they had guys open and when  we didn't blitz there was  very little pressure on their  quarterback," said YSU  Coach Heacock on the  Golden Panthers' second  half-surge. 

FIU's  defense improved  in the second half and  was led by junior defensive back John Haritan,  who posted 21 tackles (8  solo). Antwan Barnes and  Daunte Foster pounded  Zetts for one sack a piece  with a loss of 8 and 10  yards respectively.

 "I have to give them  some credit," said coach  Heacock. "I thought we  played well. We improved  a ton, which is the frustrating thing. To say that we  didn't get better or that  they aren't a good football  team is just not right. We  knew it was going to be a  tough game and it was." 

YSU was forced into  a 3-and-out to start the  half and the FIU offense  moved the ball 58 yards  before scoring their first  points of the game on  Adam Moss' 31-yard field  goal, making it a 13-3  ballgame going into the  fourth quarter. FIU had  never won a game when  losing after 3 quarters  (0-11 record). Terracino  would answer back with  his third field goal of the  night to increase the YSU  lead to 13. 

The most impressive  performances, however,  were those of first-year  starter TE Sammy Smith  and third-year back-up  quarterback David Tabor.  Smith became the first  FIU player to make 10  catches in a single game,  amassing 131 yards and a  touchdown.  

Tabor showed shades  of Strock in his Dolphins  days. Stepping in for the  struggling Padrick, he led  the offense to two consecutive touchdown drives.  The first was for 92 yards  culminating in an 11-yard  touchdown pass to Sammy  Smith. The other resulted  in a 9-yard touchdown  pass to star receiver Harold  Leath, leveling the score  at 16-16.  

"In the fourth quarter I went to my oldest  quarterback," said coach  Strock. "[This] guy has  been here from day one.  We haven't changed our  system at all. He's done  well for us before and he  reminded me of myself in  my younger days coming  off the bench." 

Neither team was able  break the deadlock in regulation time and the game  went into overtime. The  Golden Panthers reached  another milestone as they  have never won an overtime game. Tabor found  Rashod Smith and Sammy  Smith on consecutive  completions as FIU made  their way to the 1 yard line  before Tabor completed  the winning touchdown  pass to tight end James  Williams.  

"Sometimes  when  things don't go right like  they did today, coach  brings me in. I think I  bring more of a relaxed  atmosphere. The guys  have been around me a  long time so they know  what I can do. They have  confidence in me," said  Tabor. 

The extra point was  missed, giving life to a  demoralized YSU team.  On the Penguin's possession, however, defensive end Daunte Foster  stripped quarterback Tom  Zetts on a third-and-three  play from the 18-yard line  and Lance Preston recovered the football, effectively ending the game and  giving FIU its first ever  road win.

Headline: Modern church targets youth
Author: April Seipp / The Seattle Times
&nbsp;
The thought of church today may conjure up images from the opening scene of "Footloose." Parents and grandparents listen attentively to the minister while young people stare into space or squirm uncomfortably when the preacher attacks their favorite activities. The music is off-key and boring, nobody is smiling, and nobody is excited. 

Contrast that with the image of 600 young people, their arms lifted, eyes closed, singing at the top of their lungs. They're not just singing the words projected onto the three huge video screens - they're proclaiming their devotion to God. The conventional idea of church is fading and the new style - one with cutting-edge music, multimedia and a variety of meeting places that are sometimes surprising is drawing thousands of young people across the nation back into the Christian faith. 

 These church groups sometimes meet in coffeehouses, schools or people's homes. The purpose is to appeal to those who might not feel comfortable in a regular church setting. 

Skate Church in Portland, Ore., meets in a warehouse that's been transformed into a skate park. It's a ministry of Central Bible Church that reaches out to skaters in particular, offering them a place to skate and attend Bible studies. 

This new kind of church is breaking away from the typical Sunday service attendance, where people go to be reminded that there's a God somewhere out there and that they need to be careful how they behave so they don't get sent to hell. 

The old-style church is like taking an hour or two to "visit" the realm of God, and then quickly moving back into the comfortable activities of everyday life. 

The new message is more personal than that. It goes beyond just having a religion. Many in my generation incorporate their faith into every aspect of their lives. Several of my peers at Generation Church, the youth ministry of The City Church in Kirkland, have started Bible studies and prayer groups at their schools. They invite their friends to come and see what's so important to them. 

Many of them don't have Christian parents. They were invited by friends and stayed because they found a faith that related to them. 

This new, hipper version of the Christian movement can't be disregarded as something that will pass. These young people are serious about what they believe. 

They are the future of the American church.

The football team recently ascended to Divison I-A in hopes of moving toward national recognition and establishing a program similar to that of the University of Miami. While this is a bold move and certainly the fastest for a team that is merely two years old, the team showed what it could do under pressure by defeating Youngstown State University on their own home turf.   

For FIU, this win means a lot. It meant being able to boast about a young team that beat out odds like hurricanes, dismal school spirit and cancelling the first home game that could have rallied support from a dwindling fan base.  

Despite the odds and the fact that the first three quarters of the game seemed like it was handed to Youngstown State, the Golden Panthers came back in overtime and won.   

While this is a huge accomplishment, the football team should by no means take this win as a prediction of the season to come. At this point it's clear that this team has what it takes to win but only hard work and dedication will make this team a viable one in the coming years. 

In order to stay Division I-A, the team must deal with a tougher schedule and is required to average 15,000 fans per home game. At an urban and commuter university like FIU, this is a huge demand that is going to take wins, support and plenty of practices.

Headline: Assault weapon ban set to expire
Author: Luis Nin / Illustrator
&nbsp;
As the clock counts down on the decade-old ban on selling and buying assault weapons, phones have begun ringing off the hook at ArmaLite. Customers want to know when the newly outfitted AR-15 rifle will be ready.

"People are excited. They've been waiting for this for a long time, and we've been preparing," said Jodi DePorter, a spokeswoman for the Geneseo, Ill.-based gun maker.

Unless Republican congressional leaders have a sudden change of heart, the assault weapons ban - a centerpiece of the 1994 Crime Bill - will expire at midnight on Monday.

The federal law applied to 19 semiautomatic weapons, which fire one round and automatically load each time the trigger is pulled. Automatic weapons, which remain illegal, are designed for military use and shoot without stopping.

ArmaLite plans to ship newly outfitted assault rifles just hours later to customers who were so eager to get the .308 and .223 caliber semiautomatic rifles that they've pre-ordered them.

Gun manufacturers are gearing up for a wave of business once the ban sunsets. They're offering promotional coupons online for extras such as free flash suppressers and boxes of high-capacity 15-round magazines. 

Joseph Vince, the former chief of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Crime Gun Analysis Branch, predicted that the end of the ban "will cause a frenzied buying spurt."

"People will buy them in high quantities just because they will fear that this ban may go into effect yet again," Vince said.

A Consumer Federation of America report says prices for the assault weapons would drop as the supply surges. While there've been knockoffs of popular banned semiautomatic weapons such as AK-47s, Uzis and TEC-9s, some gun buyers want the real thing.

Law enforcement - which credits the ban with helping drive down the crime rate to record-low levels in the last decade - says they'll once again be outgunned by criminals.

Several dozen police chiefs from around the country converged on Washington recently to lobby members of Congress to reauthorize the ban. They also sought a meeting with President Bush, who's said he would sign a bill if it landed on his desk, but were rebuffed, said Joe Polisar, the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

Police and other supporters of the ban accused Bush of not doing anything to temper Republican opposition to the ban in the House of Representatives.

"We cannot afford a repeat of the carnage on our streets in the '70s and '80s," Los Angeles Police Chief Bill Bratton said. "We need sanity in our gun laws."

To purchase an assault weapon, customers must undergo a criminal background check. If they pass, they can walk out with a gun. Seven states - California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York - have their own assault-weapon bans that will remain in place.

The biggest opponent of the ban's renewal is the powerful National Rifle Association, which maintains that the ban was nothing more than a cosmetic fix and that there's no evidence proving it worked.

Dueling studies on the ban's effectiveness have given both sides evidence to cherry pick and make their case.

Supporters of the ban _ such as the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence - cite ATF "crime gun" data, which show that the number of outlawed weapons as a percentage of all guns the ATF has traced to crimes has fallen - from 4.82 percent before the ban to 1.61 percent after it was imposed.

The NRA counters with a study by the Urban Institute, which found that assault weapons and high-capacity magazines "were never involved in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders."

A federally funded follow-up study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania said that while the use of assault weapons in crimes has declined, the use of large-capacity magazines has been on the rise.

"Should it be renewed, the ban's effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement," said the study.

The legislation was riddled with loopholes that allowed manufacturers to rename their weapons and make minor modifications on copycat models that could then be sold legally. Weapons already out there were allowed to remain in circulation. So were magazines over the 10-round limit that the ban imposed. Just before the ban took effect, manufacturers increased production to ensure they had legal stocks in reserve. But prices on the pre-ban items have risen, putting them out of reach for some people.

For supporters, making the guns even a bit to harder to obtain is worth it.

"Why in the world would you want to return these offensive weapons to our streets and neighborhoods?" asked Tom Mauser, who lost his son Daniel in the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado.

Headline: Vice President of FIU anime club killed in car accident
Author: Luis Nin / Illustrator
&nbsp;
At the traditional Japanese Bon Festival held in Delray Beach's Morikami Museum on Aug. 28, a fleet of paper lanterns were lit and simultaneaously released into the Morikami Pond, each lantern acting as a symbolic guide to the spirits of the beloved dead. 

Some hours before the launch, the FIU Anything Goes Anime Club prepared to visit the museum in order to participate in the festival. Rain poured down as the members met in the University Park Gold Parking Garage, five of them piling into club Vice President Ben Feld's car.

In the Morikami Pond, the lantern boats for the dead waited. 

At 4:45 p.m., as Feld and his passengers rode on the Northbound Turnpike near Davie, another car suddenly cut them off, causing a roll-over on the slippery highway. While most of the passengers suffered only minor injuries, Ben Feld sustained massive wounds, being pronounced legally dead upon arrival at Plantation Hospital.

Feld died at the age of 26, two weeks before his birthday. Son of Lois Maisel and Wolf Feld, he was an FIU senior  described by his friends as cheerful, compassionate, and unique.

"Ben always wanted to be everyone's friend. He was always trying to talk to people and cheer them up," said Angel Garrido, an Anime Club member. "When I first saw him, I thought to myself, 'Who is this creepy guy that's following us around?' After a while, it was just...Ben. I don't think he ever realized how important he was to the club."

A week after Feld's death, friends and fellow club members united to honor his memory by folding 1,000 origami cranes in the GC piano lounge. The act made reference to a Japanese legend in which a young girl, trying to find hope as she struggles with radiation poisoning, decides to fold an army of cranes before her passing. Though she dies before her thousand birds are completed, the girl's friends gather at her grave and finish the job, signifying her eternal permenance among them.

"This is the first time I've seen this club come truly together," said Terry Harrington, long-time friend and survivor of the accident. "It's [as though] we're more like a family than a club."

Among his qualities, Feld's friends say his humor is what will be most missed.

"He had the unique ability to make people faint, laugh, and slap their forehead at the same time," said Rachel Dangels, Anime Club member. 

"Sometimes I would come in super stressed from work and other problems. After five minutes of talking to Ben, I would always say [to myself], 'Forget it!', knowing those things weren't really important anyway," Harrington added. "Ben would always know how to cheer you up. He did the best impersonation of Curly [of the Three Stooges] this side of the continental divide. I'm still expecting Ben to walk through that corner with a Transformer in his hand and ready to tell one of his corny-ass jokes. I'm going to miss him." 

Feld's friends later deposited the cranes on his grave, lighting a memorial lantern boat after the service.

"If Ben could see us right now, he'd probably say, 'God damn! I didn't think all these people actually cared about me,'" Garrido said.

Smiling, Terry Harrington agrees.

"If we remember Ben, let's always remember that he always had a smile and he always had a joke."

Subheadline: University Park shelter takes on Monroe County evacuees
Author: Amanda Ram√≠rez Casta√±eda / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a single day, the classroom-filled University Park building of Primera Casa was transformed into a four-floor hurricane shelter for Monroe County residents escaping what appeared to be the imminent arrival of Hurricane Ivan. 

Despite the complete Florida miss of the storm, though, evacuees crowded the hallways of PC for several days, beginning on Sept. 10 when the building was officially turned over to the American Red Cross. During the takeover, all classes on certain floors were deferred to other sites around campus until Sept. 15.

"The shelter can hold up to a thousand people," said Annette Barket, director of communications for the Red Cross.  "[On Sept. 10], 310 Monroe County residents arrived at the shelter. They sleep in the hallways of the second and third floor, and they are provided three meals a day."

As Friday night approached, residents of Monroe County began flooding into PC carrying bundles of clothing and other important possessions. 

Most people worried over the fact that Hurricane Ivan, only a week after Frances ruined thousands of properties in Florida, seemed to be making a track toward the Florida Keys with twice the force of the previous storm.

"I've never stayed at a shelter before, but Hurricane Ivan made me nervous enough to leave my home," explained Ron Houser, a carpenter from Key West.  "I only brought clothes and the pictures of my daughter, which are the most important things to me," he added, pulling a mass of pictures from his bag.

Another Monroe County resident, Camille Johnson, actually wanted Ivan to head towards the shelter instead of towards the Florida Keys.  

"I hope the hurricane hits here before it hits my island of Marathon.  It is such a small place and I don't think my home will make it through the storm," the elderly woman said as she tightly embraced a cloth doll.

Most Monroe County residents were pleased with the FIU shelter and the help provided by the Red Cross volunteers. 

"It's been great here. They all have been very helpful," said Johnson.  "Plus, I love being at the university.  Being back in school stimulates my mind," she added with a smile.

Still, not all comforts could be provided to the crowd, as some stated. 

"I can't complain about the shelter, but I wish they had showers," Houser said. "Still, they do give us food three times a day, mostly cookies and chips. I feel safe here." 

If necessary, the FIU shelter is also intended to provide sanctuary for the university students living on campus. 

"The resident students have the fourth floor of the PC building identified for their purposes. It will accommodate 500 resident students. The evacuees will be on the second and third floors," said Jim Wassenaar, director of Student Housing.

During Frances, the students living in the UP dorms were not directed to the shelter. However, those students living in the Biscayne Bay Campus were evacuated from their complex.  

"The Bay Vista residents were taken on the shuttle bus to the UP housing.  We were instructed to bring food and water," said Brianna West, journalism major.

Though the measures were taken to assure the safety of the residents, some problems faced along the way seemed to  bother some of the students.

"For [the Frances evacuation], we weren't well informed.  The evacuation order came in at 1:00 and we had to be out of the building by 2:00.  I feel the transference of information from UP to BBC isn't great," West added.

Contrary to the experience of some BBC residents, some students at UP felt well informed during the days of both hurricanes. 

"We constantly get notices informing us about what we should do.  They are posted all over the building and left at each apartment door," Danika James, an English education major and resident of the UP apartments, said.

As the weekend progressed, students found themselves unsure of the procedures that might be taken were Ivan to strike Miami-Dade County. Since the hurricane's path was temporarily projected to veer away from Florida, though, no exact measures were taken by housing.

"Only if the university is under a direct threat of being hit by hurricane force winds are the students moved into the PC shelter.  If they are tropical force winds, they remain in the housing," Wassenaar explained.  

"[As to BBC], if Dade County issues a mandatory evacuation for the North Miami Beach area, that is when we evacuate."

Headline: Housebroken art represented through new art exhibit
Author: Jarrod Miller-Dean / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Stalactite wads of chewing gum stained the color of melted sherbet ice cream dangle from the ceiling, dripping onto crocheted floor mats. Nylon and papier-m√¢ch√© creatures sat in silence with cyclops eyes hanging from their heads like Snorks.  House wives and children with butcher knives crept in the shadows, ready to slash back at middle-class society.  

When one thinks of the home, very few envision these creations of chaos. But in the eyes of artist Chad Abel, they show the true unspoken, unheard, and unseen physiological dementia of life.

Widely known for tampering in the always changing off-beat creative side of pop culture, Objex Art Space unleashed its newest visions onto the public Sept. 11 as part of Abel's new exhibit, Home and Garden: A Dip In The Deep End of Domesticity.

Crowds, varying from the young and trendy to the old and contemporary, admired these morphed marvels and sipped beer or wine while house music cynically spun in the background as Abel and gallery owner Dustin Orlando mingled about, explaining the emotions and thought of each display.   

Able totters like a see-saw on both sides of domestic home life, showing crocheted floor mats and toys, while diving head first into a dark, dysfunctional view of Darwinism. The main collection was made up of photos and prints showing common families with murderous results. This isn't your average Brady Bunch sitting down to dinner. Wives and children tightly gripped blood-stained butcher knives standing ready to jump out and attack at any moment.  A little girl in one of the photos had a look on her face that would most likely land her on a CNN Headline News exclusive as the next "Bed-Time Butcher." 

One of the few paintings that stood out depicted women de-evolved to their primitive roots eating the hearts of their young while bathing in the blood. It definitely put a new twist on the phrase "food for thought."

The displays made from children's toys were even more perplexing, with one in particular resembling a dollhouse left over after a Freddy Krueger nightmare, with parts of the roof peeled back, like a candy wrapper, revealing its organs and inner tissue.  On the inside, a toy rocking horse sat as its young fed from its underbelly as a yapping wind-up dog resembling something out of Bj√∂rk's "Human Nature" video guarded the door.  

Don't think that because something's obscure, the public won't respond to it. To be on the cutting edge of the newest and most shocking works in the scene, one has to be willing to spend a few bucks. Prices for each work varied from $150 a print to somewhere in the thousands.  No one ever said that art was cheap. None the less, the creative pieces would spark conversation at any dinner party.

While playing hop-scotch on the psychological edge of the middle-American nightmare, the exhibit made sense of its chaos, showing that Martha Stewart-style, mild-mannered living is not all that it appears when cut skin-deep.

Abel's exhibit can be seen at Objex Art Space, located at 203 NW 36th St., until Oct. 25. Visit www.objexartspace.com or call 305-573-4400 for gallery times and other up and coming events.

Headline: Van Halen still rocks
Author: Jason Geller / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the strong smell of hemp wafting in the air and the satisfying aroma of beer filling the stands Mega-Metal group Van Halen performed to a raucous crowd in The Office Depot Center in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday Sept. 11.  The concert had been rescheduled due to Hurricane Frances.

As soon as the arena lights dimmed and the strobes lights colored the stage, the excited crowd began to scream and move about in eager anticipation of the groups' arrival.  

Eddie Van Halen entered the stage first and saluted the crowd with fists pumping through the air and sweet notes floating from his guitar.  Then Lead singer Sammy Hagar, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony followed him onstage and kicked the night off with a number 1 chart-topper "Jump", giving a jolt to the arena that would not stop shaking until long after the night was through.

Sammy Hagar came to impress, and it wasn't just his vocals.  I had grown to love the flamboyant and pompous manner in which original Van Halen lead singer David Lee Roth conducted himself as well as his magnificent voice.  But Hagar, sporting red jump suit pants, a blue T and a red winter hat cavorted around the stage working his way from the back to the front, and the left of the stage to the right, shaking audience members hands all the way through.  

Some lucky ones even got to take over the microphone. A much more sincere and genuine guy than Roth, Hagar made everyone in the crowd feel like they were his best bud.  He even jumped into the crowd to sing along with the awed fans.

Eddie Van Halen was his usual charismatic self continuingly revving up the crowd with his electric chords and commanding stage presence.  Long-haired and shirtless and wearing orange skateboarder pants, Eddie looked like he was having the time of his life, hopping around with his guitar like a skater doing an olly.

Looking like a bad-ass motorcyclist from "Hells Angels" bassist Michael Anthony donned his custom-made bass that is designed like a bottle of Jack Daniels.  Anthony even chugged down some Jack Daniels onstage to the delight of the adoring crowd.

Musically the group was as good as they have ever been.  Eddie Van Halen continues to amaze with the impossible chords he produces from his guitar.  Eddie played a ten minute guitar solo, making some of the most uniquely-satisfying sounds you're ever going to hear.  Not to be left out was the solo that made him legendary: "Eruption."

Alex Van Halen was supernatural on drums, accelerating pace as quickly as a Z-4, with a ten minute drum solo that could only be matched by his brother's guitar playing.  It was medicine for the ears.

Sammy Hagar still has it instrumentally.  He even played guitar, strumming two beautifully ballads in tribute to the September 11th attacks that were as good as any of the songs the band played collectively.  Besides singing feverishly on ground level, Hagar sung atop a set design fifty feet above the stage.

Van Halen left the stage as well as their instruments to a chorus of cheers.  The arena went black as the screaming fans began chanting "Eddie-Eddie-Eddie", urging the guitarist and the rest of Van Halen to come back for more.  The band soon satisfied their requests delivering an uproarious encore. 

During it they played a roof shattering "Ain't Talking Bout Love" as well as their smash hit "Panama."  They left the stage once again but the screaming fans still wanted more.  Van Halen came back and performed just what the crowd had been waiting for the whole night long, shaking the house with "You Really Got Me."

A fitting way to end a superb concert and just what this state needed.

Subheadline: Haitian sculpture exhibit haunts FIU
Author: Daphne Morales / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The spirit of independence hit FIU's South Campus this weekend with hurricane fury as Lespri Endependan, the haunting new Haitian sculpture exhibit at the Frost Art Museum opened to artists, intellectuals, and the entire university community.  

Taking hold of that spirit and commanding the stage with his indomitable charisma, Geoffrey Holder, actor, dancer, painter and multitalented superstar presided over the opening ceremony, launching the Steven & Dorothea Green Critics' Lecture Series for the 2004-05 season. Students may remember Holder as Punjab in the movie/musical "Annie," or perhaps seen him during the '80s in 7-Up commercials advertising the "un-cola".  

The influence Haitian culture plays on Holder's career can be witnessed in the 1950's movie "Live & Let Die," where he embodies the part of a voodoo medicine doctor and dancer.  The actor also collects Haitian art, enjoying the symbolism behind  many of the pieces. 

Born in Trinidad, Geoffrey's love of Haitian art developed from an innate curiosity of the world around him and the appreciation of art he gained from his older brother Bosco who would sing mystical songs and entertain him with folk tales. 

During Friday night's hypnotic lecture, Holder cited, "I love Haiti because it is the richest country in the Caribbean...in folklore and art. The people know their gods, like the Greeks did." 

FIU students were a minority at the opening event, but those present were certainly glad to be there.

"The most impressive quality about Geoffery Holder is that he is full of knowledge. Also his passion," said Luis Atencio, a 3rd year computer science major.

Cultural pride is part of the moral fiber inherent not only in Geoffrey Holder's  life and work but also in that of the sculptors whose works are on display at the museum. A striking variety of pieces encompassing 50 years of Haitian sculpture make up Lespri Endependan, on display at the Frost Art Museum until Dec. 5, 2004. 

"Haitian art has been overlooked," says Dr. Carol Damian of FIU's Art Department, "This is the first show of monumental Haitian sculpture. 

It is one of the most exciting and beautiful exhibits known in a museum."

In fact, many of the artists whose masterpieces are on display have never shown their work.  Some have simply made their creations and left them on their property in Haiti, not even displaying in native Haitian galleries. For the first time at this jewel of an exhibit, Haitian artists are well represented, and acknowledged, especially during this year which marks the bicentennial of Haitian independence from France. 

Fredo Boyer, a Haitian immigrant who lives in Miami's Little Haiti community, says the exhibit helps open a window to the world's eye on Haiti as a culture. 

He feels blessed and lucky to see the presentation, "It's interesting to hear the experiences of foreigners who came before us."

Lespri Endependan is victory celebrated. The entire mood of the atmosphere surrounding the exhibit is one of strength and determination. Much of that victory from Napoleon 200 years ago did not occur without great sacrifice and death, and these themes also emanate from the works presented. 

However, pride apart, these pieces are not just stock samples of work to be labeled as Haitian art. Other sculptors, such as Mario Benjamin, who is an accomplished installation artist, are happy to continue forging ahead with showings of his handiwork regardless of the fact that he is Haitian. 

He creates art for art's sake and does not place a barrier between Haitian art and the world's art, "I am an artist. Not a Haitian artist. Haiti is no longer just an island. We are in the middle of the Americas, we have internet cafes."

One of the most impressive aspects of Lespri Endependan is how these artists, who come from the poorest nation in the western hemisphere, make something out of nothing. 

The materials used to create the structures are common found objects transformed through welding, hammering, and carving. Perhaps this is the way people deal with poverty; by making the best of what little they have. 

A great part of the exhibit plays on the taboo religion and practice of voodoo, a polytheistic religion potentially offensive directly handed down from African descendants and blended with elements borrowed from the Catholic religion. 

Overall the exhibit is very strong and quite sophisticated. Each piece tells a different story but they all have a direct connection with the spirit of freedom handed down years ago. The ghosts of their ancestors come alive in the works being presented at the exhibition. 

Lespri Endependan is free to the entire university community with proper identification. Throughout the fall semester, speakers, artists and scholars will be showing films and presenting events which are sure to destroy notions of what is typically thought of as Haitian while asserting the purity of the republic, gaining the respect of all.
