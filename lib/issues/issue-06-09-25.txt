Headline: Who will win the National League MVP?
Subheadline: Albert Pujols provides more for his playoff-bound team
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The favorite choice for the National League Most Valuable Player this year is obviously the new kid from Philadelphia, Ryan Howard. 

There's no denying why he's the top choice; after all, he does lead the majors in homeruns and RBI as of Sept. 22. 

And he's only 26 years old.

But I think another 26-year-old is more deserving of the award, because not only is he doing almost the exact same thing that Howard is doing this year, he's been doing it for the past six seasons.

Even though I'm one of the many who believe Albert Pujols is not really 26 - all it takes is one look at him and you can clearly see he's in his mid-to-late 30s - there's still no question that he is one of the best players in baseball.

Even though Pujols has less homeruns and RBIs than Howard this season - 46 and 129 to 57 and 140, respectively - his team is almost certainly guaranteed a playoff spot. Howard's Phillies are still fighting for the NL Wild Card, despite Howard's gaudy numbers.

You can argue that the Phillies wouldn't even be competing for a Wild Card spot if it wasn't for Howard, but you can also say that the St. Louis Cardinals would be leading the Central Division if it wasn't for Pujols.

If the Phillies don't make the playoffs, and there's a good chance they won't, what good are Howard's numbers to them? 

Going back to a head-to-head comparison, Pujols does have a higher batting average, .328 to .312; a high on-base percentage, .428 to .414; and a slightly higher slugging percentage, .672 to .670.

Also, Pujols has batted 17.55 percent of the Cardinals' 735 runs scored. Howard has batted in 140 of his team's 806 runs scored - slightly lower than Pujols' 17.4 percent.

Yes, .15 is not that big of a discrepancy but, considering Howard's team has scored 71 more runs than Pujols' team, it means Pujols' RBIs are more important to his team - even though he has less than Howard.

Also this season, Pujols became one of only 16 players in Major League Baseball history to have two 3-homerun games in the same season. 

Out of those 16 players, Pujols is one of only four to accomplish the feat in the same stadium.

Pujols also set the record for most homeruns in the month of April with 14 this season and became one of only 20 players in MLB history to hit four homeruns in four consecutive plate appearances.

Continuing with Pujols' 2006 homerun-related accomplishments, he became the fastest player in MLB history to hit 19 homeruns in a season and the third fastest to hit 25 - behind anti-role models Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire, his former teammate.

Sadly, it's come to a point in baseball where a player with Pujols-type numbers and a Pujols-type physique - 6'3" and a chiseled 225 lbs. - may be questioned about the use of performances enhancemers.

You can't blame people for this mentality, but you still have to follow the rule of law enforcement: everyone is innocent until proven guilty. 

So, despite his spectacular numbers and his muscular physique, Pujols has done nothing to be suspected of wrongdoing and that's a sigh of relief.

Even though the MVP is chosen based on what a player has done in one particular season, you have to take into consideration, if only in the back of your mind, that Pujols has been putting up great numbers consistently since his rookie season of 2001.

But what the NL MVP race will ultimately come down to will be which team makes the playoffs, and Pujols' Cardinals have the best shot. 

Besides, you have to hope Pujols wins, if only to hear anchors pronounce his last name, Poo-Holes, which makes little kids giggle.

Oh, who am I kidding? It still makes me giggle, too.

Headline: Who will win the National League MVP?
Subheadline: Howard's record numbers lead team into wild-card
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It's been a close race for this year's National League Most Valuable Player award and sports writers all around the nation are arguing with each other why St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols or New York Mets centerfielder Carlos Beltran should win the award.

To be quite honest, both of these candidates would be worthy choices, but neither are right choices. 

The worthy candidate would be Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard.

Howard was almost traded after they signed former Cleveland Indian slugger Jim Thome. In his first two years, Thome put up the numbers that were expected of him, which caused Howard to sit in the minors before he had a chance to show his capabilities. While Thome began dazzling the home crowd with his homeruns, many teams tried to trade for Howard. Luckily for the Phillies, they stood by their prospect.

As last year's Rookie of the Year recipient, he has fans in Philly salivating over what could be. Why all the hype? Consider this: he batted a .312 with a slugging percentage of .670, belted 57 homeruns and drove in 140 RBI. All of this at the age of 26 and he's only making $355,000 this year. Talk about a bargain. 

Barring no set back, he has the capability of being a Hall of Famer if he continues to improve and maintain this production.

Hall of Famer Cal Ripkin Jr. is the only other player in baseball history to win Rookie of the Year and MVP awards consecutively. Howard should definitely be the second.

Besides the numbers, an MVP candidate has to have some type of game breaking ability that will help his team when they are needed the most. 

Great hitters like San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds, and Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz have that ability and Howard is just beginning to master this craft.

Among the 57 balls he had driven out of the park, 23 of them have helped put the Phillies ahead in a game when they were down and five of them have tied games.

Late in the season is when MVP winners separate themselves from the pack. They put their teams on their shoulders and carry them into the postseason. Rowand is no exception.

On July 30, the Phillies were 47-54 and the team was considered finished. The Phillies had the feel of a rebuilding team. 

Their star player, right fielder Bobby Abreau, was traded to the New York Yankees and people began to question the direction of the team.

How did Howard respond to the trade? Oh, by simply batting .374, slugging .837, driving in 67 RBI and smashing 28 homeruns since the All-Star break. 

Besides his individual numbers, he set up teammates to drive in runs by being walked 94 times. 

His play propelled the Phillies back into the race for the NL wild card. 

And with the season winding down, they are relying on his bat to get them into the postseason. The Phillies haven't won a World Series since 1980 and, with Howard batting a cleanup, the chances don't seem so slim anymore.

He is peaking at the right time. 

In August, he had his best month batting .348, slugging .348, driving in 41 runs and hitting 14 homeruns.

The former fifth round amateur draft pick from Southwest Missouri State is his way to greatness and it can begin with an MVP award this year.

He's currently tied for 13th for the single season homerun record with Alex Rodriguez and Luis Gonzalez and is on pace to finish the season with 60 or more homeruns. 

Only  five players in the history of baseball have ever accomplished the feat: Bonds; former St. Louis Cardinal Mark McGwire; former Chicago Cub Sammy Sosa; New York Yankees Roger Maris and Babe Ruth.

Can you say MVP?

Subheadline: Midfielder attempts to leave mark at FIU
Author: Jannel Palenzuela / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Coming into her senior year, Valerie Patrick has earned a starting position in 58 of 59 games throughout her women's soccer career.  

As a freshman, she was one of only two whose hard work was rewarded by starting all 17 games.

It was during her first season that the midfielder from Littleton, Col.,  scored her first goal. It was the only goal FIU could manage to come up with in a match against Denver in October 2003. Prior to that, she recorded two assists on a pair of goals in a win against Charleston South in September 2003.

"I didn't expect to get so much playing time at first," Patrick said. "I was shocked and I especially didn't expect to start every game."

Throughout her second season as a sophomore, Patrick scored four goals on the year. 

Three of those goals were game-winners. That same year she was named to the Sun Belt Conference All-Tournament Team after two goals in a quarterfinal win against Western Kentucky in November 2004.

Although Patrick did not score a goal during the 2005 season as a junior, she was one of only 3 players that played in and started all 16 games. She recorded two assists and 24 shots that year.

As her career has progressed, Patrick realizes that there are many goals she has achieved. 

Despite all her accomplishments, there is still one that she is working harder than ever to reach.

"Winning the conference has always been our main focus," Patrick said. "It's my last year and it would be great to win it. We have a good feeling this year."

Assistant Coach Ifeoma Dieke added, "This is her last year and it is important for her to be able to lift the team. She and [Kristy] Webb are our most consistent players, and we need that from them."

While working toward winning the conference, there are games that will not go as good as hoped for.

As a senior, Patrick knows you can't win them all. It is during those times that the team as a whole looks for ways to pick themselves up.

"I try to keep my mind focused on the next game," Patrick said. "But I know that there is only a certain amount of time you have before your season is done."

"She has a lot of leadership qualities that help the team," sophomore defender Kia Rigsby said.

As a leader, Patrick knows it is important to maintain a level of toughness both on herself and on her younger teammates.

"The younger players really look up to her," Dieke said. "And they should. She gives 100% every time and has become a more demanding player."

That persistence may come from Patrick's reliance on her dad, who also played soccer and pushes her when she feels that she is losing focus. He also provided her with optimism and some overall constructive criticism.

"He has always pushed be to be a better player," Patrick said. "He will tell me when I am doing well. But he will tell me flat out when I am not doing so well and would have me do things over until I would get them right."

Patrick hopes to leave an impact on the FIU team prior to the end of the season. 

"I want to be remembered as a leader," Patrick said. "I also want to make sure that the girls know that soccer is fun. If you work hard toward your goals, you could get to them. And of course, win the conference."

Her teammates will also remember her for her personality.

"She has really brought a level of excitement to the team," Rigsby said.

Subheadline: Redeploy or reinforce: two takes on the Iraq problem
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
~ CHRIS ON CHRIS: A POLITICAL DEBATE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT~


Chris Cabral: On the Left

The Bush Administration contends that our purpose in Iraq is to establish a democracy, and that the war in Iraq is about "freedom" and "liberation." That's a very clever argument. Who doesn't love freedom or democracy? 

This misleading framing of the Iraq issue begs the question: What if our troops could vote on this issue? Would they want to "stay the course" in Iraq? Or do they feel their mission is "accomplished" and want to go home?

According to the most recent poll published by Zogby International back in late February, 72 percent of American troops stationed in Iraq believe that they should leave within a year. According to another poll conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes and World Public Opinion Online, 70 percent of Iraqis favor a pullout of U.S. troops within two years and 87 percent favor a timetable for withdrawal. 

These findings, coupled with growing American opposition to this war, point to a growing need for this nation to redeploy its forces, in the name of our security and the popular will. Currently, there are two major Democratic plans for dealing with Iraq, as proposed by Senator Joe Biden, Delaware, and Representative John Murtha, Pennsylvania.

Biden calls for the establishment of three provinces, giving the Shiites, Kurds and Sunnis partial control over one region each. The Kurds in the north have long separated themselves from the rest of the country, forming their own separate society in northern Iraq, which they call Kurdistan. The rest of the country would be split between the two other warring factions.

All three regions would answer to the central government, which would deal with national issues like border security and oil revenue-sharing. This plan could stabilize Iraq, and allow our troops to leave.

Murtha's plan, which was proposed in mid-2005, calls for the "redeployment" of American troops. When this plan was first proposed, it sent shockwaves through Washington. Murtha, a former Marine colonel who served in Vietnam, has long had a reputation for being a tough-minded hawk. 

After talking with several generals and pondering the Iraq issue, he proposed sending most of our troops home, while keeping a small force in the region in case trouble arises. If Al-Qaeda establishes a "terror camp" in Iraq, our troops can swoop in and take them out. If they need more people in Afghanistan, they can enter the country and assist NATO. 

What's more, the Iraqi people would be given control of their country. Rumsfeld and Bush have long been touting Iraqi security forces, claiming that we've trained hundreds of thousands. 

Let's take them at their word, and let those forces take over. "Mission Accomplished," you say? Great, then let's get the hell out already.

Of course, Bush and company don't want to do that. They've spent billions toward building as many as 14 permanent bases, each capable of holding thousands of troops. This led one American soldier to declare in an interview with MSNBC: "I think we'll be here forever."

Well, not if the Democrats can help it.





Chris Necuze: On the Right

I am not going to try and convince you that the war in Iraq has been the easy victory that had been promised. Nor am I going to paint a rosy picture of the situation in that region of the world; the situation is anything but rosy.

Unfortunately, that situation has escalated to a conflict so heated that it has surpassed even the direst pre-war predictions. As President Bush has made clear time and time again, the war in Iraq has become the epicenter of the war against Islamic radicalism. Victory in that theater is vital; failure is out of the question.

With every passing day, more and more Iraqi civilians are being killed by Muslim insurgents. Not only do they have no regard for the life of their own people, they also show complete disrespect for Muslim traditions and have ignored the peaceful nature of their god for selfish gain.

It is important that we understand the enemies we are fighting if we are determined to beat them. While the overwhelming truth is that Muslims are the ones who are killing Muslims, the United States, and specifically President Bush, still gets the blame for the increase in violence.  

Abu Ghraib and other isolated incidents like it go a long way in defacing the good name of the United States and giving our enemies ammunition to use against us, even though they are the ones strapping on explosives and blowing themselves up in a crowded market or mosque.

A new direction is needed in Iraq. Whichever path we choose, however, it must be one that includes the annihilation of the insurgency in Iraq.

The Democrats' plan for Iraq, if you even want to call it that, is mostly based on the strategy devised by John Murtha, a congressman from Pennsylvania. 

I respect a man like Murtha. Any man who has served in the armed forces and fought for my freedoms has earned my respect for life. I also respect his ideas. As far as I am concerned, he is the only member of the Democratic Party with a realistic plan - flawed as it is - to leave Iraq.

My Republican colleagues will have you believe that Murtha's plan could be summed up in three words: cut and run. Even though I disagree with the plan, after reviewing it, even I must admit that this is not true. Murtha's plan includes things that in an ideal setting would be achieved; however, he fails to propose how we would get to that point. 

One problem I have with Murtha's plan is that it imposes restrictions on anti-terror operations in Iraq. The problem with the "quick-response" forces that Murtha talked about in a Nov. 17, 2005 press release in which he outlined his plan is that they are response forces. U.S. forces need to be actively engaging the enemy, not simply waiting and responding.

Second, although a redeployment of U.S. troops would be lovely, it is unreasonable to presume that the Iraqi armed forces are yet capable of handling their own security. 

Before we can consider moving our troops elsewhere, control of Iraq's 18 provinces must handed over to Iraqi forces. Currently, only two have been handed over so far, the most recent of which took place on Sept. 22. 

There are certain things that the United States must do to ensure that Iraq will be a safer place in the long run and a beacon of peace throughout the Middle East.

Though the issue of Iraq splits this nation, solutions to the problem are really non-partisan. Unlike issues like abortion in which liberals and conservatives disagree on fundamental levels, it is in the best interest of everyone that the conflict in Iraq is won  

We are entrenched in a war where the enemy is testing our resolve and trying to break our back. We must face them with renewed conviction and hunt them where they sleep. We must finish the job in Iraq; failure is not an option.

Headline: Research institute hosts discussion on future of Cuba
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
As part of its continuing lecture series-"Between Fidel and Raul: What's Next For Cuba?" - the Cuban Research Institute  will host "Democratic Transition in Cuba? Possibilities for Change," a panel discussion moderated by renowned academic Frank Mora Sept. 27 at University Park. 

The lecture series analyzes the state of current events in Cuba.

At the event, the second in the series, Mora is expected to discuss the findings of a recent report published by the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba, which along with discussing a push for democratic change, suggested recommendations to help a future Cuban democratic government overcome the social, economic and political issues with Fidel Castro's government.

Mora will discuss democratic transition in Cuba, according to Uva de Aragón, associate director of the CRI.

"He's a very well informed academic and has a deep understanding of the reality in Cuba," de Aragón said. "It is important for the faculty, students and the community in Miami to know about the reality on the island."

Mora, a professor of National Security Strategy at the National War College in Washington, D.C., has published more than 20 academic journal articles and book chapters on civil-military relations in Latin America, U.S.-Latin American relations, drug trafficking as well as the Latin American political economy and Cuban politics and military.

The first panel discussion, held Aug. 9 in the Graham Center Ballrooms at UP, was hosted by Damian Fernandez, current interim vice provost of the Biscayne Bay Campus and director of the CRI, Javier Corrales, a political science professor at Amherst College and Anthony Maingot and Lisandro Pérez, professors of sociology.

Although the certainty of events in the "Between Fidel and Raul" series will depend on the changes in Cuba, Alma de Rojas, coordinator for the CRI, is confident that there will be more panels in the near future.

"Right now, this is the last one on our calendar but there will definitely be more," de Rojas said. 

De Aragón hopes many students show up to the event although she admits that it would be hard to know for sure how many will actually attend.

"It's always hard to know how many people will show up unless professors make students come in for extra credit," said de Aragón. "We do it at this time because it's easier for students to come and we hope there'll be many Cuban-American students because this affects their lives, and it gives them an understanding of their roots and community."

Founded in 1991, the CRI is the nation's leading institute for research and academic programs on Cuban and Cuban-American issues, according to the Latin American and Caribbean Center at FIU. 

The institute employs the expertise of more than 40 FIU faculty members who are spread across various different colleges of the University. The institute has also supported trips to and from Cuba by FIU faculty and students in Cuba.

Apart from the "Between Fidel and Raul" series, de Aragón expects the CRI to host many other events throughout the year including a day-time lecture series focused mainly towards students of the University, a series focusing on the relationship between Cuba and the Caribbean and a series on Cuban musicians.

"I really would like students to come to these events as they are very pertinent to our own lives in Miami," said de Aragón. "What happens in Cuba in the next few years is going to affect this University, Miami and many families who live here."

Headline: SOC club fair aims to entertain
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
With the academic year completing its first month, many students have been fishing around campus for different organizations and clubs to join. 

However, this week, students will get the opportunity to join and learn about more than 140 different clubs on campus.

Every semester, the Student Organizations Council, the governing body for every registered student club on campus, organizes a club fair to allow these student clubs to promote themselves and recruit new members. 

This semester's fair, which takes place from Sept. 25-28, between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the Graham Center forum, will feature performances by numerous clubs, Hawaiian Hula dancers and daily pizza eating contests.  

"We're planning to promote all the clubs," said SOC President Francys Crevier. "The council has planned entertainment for the event but the most interesting aspect is going to be the demonstrations by student clubs."

 To keep with the tradition of a regular fair, SOC Events Coordinator Anthony Munyaka and Crevier organized and planned activities such as a Limbo dancing contest and a daily Hawaiian Pizza eating contest where winners will be awarded SOC gift packets and towels.

"For this semester's fair, we were looking for something fun to involve all the students who pass by," said Crevier. "We're going to be giving away SOC sandals, which has never been a giveaway before. There's going to be hula dancing, free food and free t-shirt airbrushing."

Clubs interested in being a part of the fair have to register with the council as soon as the dates are announced because the number of tables assigned are limited as compared to organizations

"The clubs that get the tables are always selected on a first come, first serve basis," Crevier said.

On Sept. 25, academic and engineering clubs such as the American Chemical Society and the Society of Physics students will get the opportunity to demonstrate the activities of their clubs.

"The chemistry and physics clubs usually have had dry ice demonstrations at previous club fairs," Crevier said. 

"During the dry ice demonstration, the clubs insert balloons into dry ice and give out frosted balloons to students."

Social Clubs, which comprise of some of the largest clubs in the SOC get their chance to promote themselves Sept. 26. 

Popular clubs such as the Black Student Union, the Caribbean Students Association, and the Indian Students Association, who usually host large scale events and parties on campus are expected to perform cultural demonstrations to students.

Wednesday, Sept. 27, will be geared to art, health and sports clubs such as the FIU Soccer Club and the Student Dance Association.

The last day of the fair, Sept. 28, will be reserved for the business, political, religious and service clubs. 

Even relatively new clubs such as the FIU College Democrats, the Bowling Club and Amnesty International are encouraged to participate in the fair.

"It's not necessary for new clubs to participate in the fair, but it is encouraged," Munyaka said in a previous Beacon article. "It would be dumb not to do so because the fair is a great opportunity to promote and recruit."

According to Crevier, the best thing about the club fair is many people realize that there are a lot of unique and fascinating clubs that they didn't know existed.

Headline: SGA creates window painting guidelines
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Student Government Affairs recently passed Resolution 06-06 in order to set some guidelines and regulations with regards to the windows in FIU's Graham Center which serve as a canvas for advertisements of upcoming events.

"It's a great way to market, because it's something that students can always see, and it's cheap," said Alfonso "Alfie" Leon, president of Student Government Affairs. "It's free for students to do this."

Resolution 06-06, which was unanimously passed by representatives of SGA Sept. 6, states that all FIU organizations, such as Campus Life, Panther Rage and the Student Organizations Council, are permitted to use the glass surfaces and windows on the first floor of GC to advertise upcoming events and programs to students in an attempt to "promote co-curriculum education through student programming and involvement."  

Prior to this resolution, there was no system in place regulating student organizations' use of painted advertisements in GC.

"It's a good way for students to see just quick information," said Rosalyn Delgado, SPC Concerts Committee co-chair. "For MTVU, we had a couple of students come in looking for tickets, and saying they had found out about the concert and knew where to find the tickets because they saw our window paintings."

The resolution, a result of collaboration between GC and SGA, places restrictions such as how long paintings can remain posted. According to the new rules, student organizations must reserve space through GC's main office, and it is up to the discretion of GC as to which organizations receive priority. 

Organizations must provide a start and end date for their advertising period, and all advertising must be removed within 24 hours after the end date or face a fine, the amount of which will be determined by the GC.

"I think it's a great idea," said Alex Ravelo, Homecoming overall director. "It provides a little bit of uniformity when it comes to window painting, and it keeps our University center clean."

"The Graham Center came up to Student Government and they asked us for recommendations on what we'd like to do in terms of window painting," said Leon.

Subheadline: FIU, local leaders disagree on Metrorail's location
Author: Angelina Troff / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A station for the Miami-Dade County Metrorail is scheduled to arrive at FIU in 2015, but its exact location remains contested.

The debate came to a head at an East-West Corridor Meeting held in the Graham Center on Sept. 20, attended by Miami-Dade Transit, City of Sweetwater government officials and a mixed group of FIU students and Student Government Association members.

The City of Sweetwater commission is adamant that the stop should follow the turnpike, while the FIU community generally embraces the 107th Avenue option.

John Kulpa, project manager and chief transportation planner, presented the proposed stop options: There are currently three options for an FIU stop: the west side of the turnpike, the east side of the turnpike and the "front-door" option at SW 16th Street and 107th Avenue-which will adjoin to where the current bus stops are located.

If the 107th Avenue option is employed, there could be a stop at FIU's Engineering Campus as well.

The Metrorail is a high speed, electrically powered form of elevated transportation that connects parts of the county

This is, however, where consensus ended. 

"As a student, I do not believe that if [the Metrorail] comes down the turnpike it will serve the interests of the school … We need to cater to the needs of FIU as a university, which involves it coming down 107th [Avenue]," said Providence Okoye, SGC-UP vice president.

The Sweetwater City Commission, however, passed Resolution No. 3246 on Sept. 11 calling for a Turnpike stop. 

"Sweetwater does not want a train to go through our city.  Sweetwater is less than one square mile, and this will divide the city," said Vice Mayor Ariel Aberaliras.

"We have to work together. FIU needs to partner with us and not be what it's been: the ugly stepchild across the street," said Sweetwater Mayor Manny Marono.

In an attempt to mediate, Philip Stoddard, representing the Faculty Senate, considered the benefit to Sweetwater citizens.

"This can be an opportunity to bring together the two sides of Sweetwater," Stoddard said.

SGC-UP president Alfonso "Alfie" Leon agreed.

"Connecting our university to the community will become a part of the community. It's more important to talk to the residents and compromise with the people we are living with," Leon said. 

Currently, Miami-Dade Metrorail averages about 59,000 riders daily.  The Metrorail operating budget for the existing system for the 2006 fiscal year is more than $41 million and expected revenues are just over $17 million, according to the MDC-transit website.

The Sept. 20 forum was the second in a series of three public meetings regarding the Metrorail to take place that week. MDC publicized these meetings in a media release Sept. 14 on their website.

Headline: Nursing student fatally shot by brother
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Damarys Blanco was a regular teen. She went to parties and night clubs with her friends and wanted to pursue a degree in Nursing at FIU. 

To the shock of friends and family, her body was found along with her grandmother's, 67-yearold Amelia Gomez, covered in blood-soaked towels Sept. 20., according to The Miami Herald.

Alfredo "Freddie" Blanco, Damarys' brother and Gomez's grandson, murdered both of them then killed himself. Gomez suffered a wound to the hand, which could mean she tried to defend herself, according to the article.

Freddie Blanco's suicide took place after an eight-hour standoff with Miami Police Department SWAT. They were able to enter the Southwest Miami-Dade home where Damarys Blanco, 19, was found shot and killed.  

Vanessa Reyes, Blanco's aunt, remembered Damarys Blanco as someone who was very family oriented and helpful to others.

"She was very bright. She was very happy, very social, and dynamic; she was always very lively," Reyes, a hairdresser at University Park's Santi's Unisex Hair and Nail Salon, told The Beacon. 

According to The Miami Herald, neighbors of the Blanco household heard strange noises resembling gunshots Sept. 19 and Sept. 20.

"It was like thunder," Ana Vallez said in that article. "I knew something bad was happening inside."

Despite suspecting foul play, no one notified the police until Sept. 21.

Freddie Blanco was manic-depressive and wasn't taken seriously by many, according to Evelin Suarez, a friend of Damarys Blanco since high school.

"He was always online, or playing video games and wasn't very social," Suarez told The Beacon. "He was so quiet that you wouldn't think he'd hurt a fly." 

Although it is still unclear when Blanco and Gomez were shot, Reyes said that Blanco had gone to check up on her grandmother who wasn't doing well.

Teresa Blanco Martinez, another of Blanco's aunts, had noticed changes in her nephew's behavior a week before he killed himself, according to The Miami  Herald.

"He had stopped eating," Martinez said in the article. "I told him he had gotten too skinny. He lost too much weight."

According to Suarez, Freddie Blanco was suicidal.

"He himself told his aunt a week and a half ago that he was going to kill himself and no one took him seriously," Suarez said.

Following the tragedy, Damarys Blanco's Facebook and accounts were flooded with friends' messages recounting fond memories spent with her. 

"I last saw her about a couple of months ago when we went to a [dance] club," said Suarez. "We used to have so much fun together. It's just really hard to believe she's no longer with us."

Subheadline: Film:  Borat
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
If you're looking for the family film of the year with the celebrity cast and the Elton John soundtrack, "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" is most certainly not your destination.

Without doubt, one of the most offensive movies ever made, Borat insults just about everyone - Jews, Gays, Women, Christians, Gypsies, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, the American government, the American national anthem and even the country of Uzbekistan, not to mention Kazakhstan, the home nation of Borat.

However despite offending all of the above, the movie is still the funniest thing I've seen in my life. Don't believe me? What other movie would feature a seven minute physical fight between two butt-naked Arab men (Borat and his obese manager) battling it out in a hotel room? 

The fight moves from outrageous and disgusting to outright ridiculous as Borat and his obese manager take their physical and sexually suggestive fight from their room into the hotel lobby and finally into a Mortgage Brokers Convention at the hotel ballrooms. Oh, and during this whole time, they're cursing at each other and screaming like girls in an incomprehensible Russian language. If that scene doesn't sound funny to you, then you my friend don't have a sense of humor.

Borat Sagdiyev, the brainchild of British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, the creator and star of HBO's Da Ali G Show, is a satirical Kazakhistani journalist who constantly offends unsuspecting individuals with his unorthodox attitude and questions. In Borat - The Movie, Borat has been sent by his country to learn about the cultures and traditions of America so that Kazakhstan can learn from the U.S.A.

Clocking in at 82 minutes and shot as a mockumentary, Borat is mostly a collection of fantastic skits featuring Cohen (as Borat) offending regular unsuspecting people, strung together by Borat's goal of finding the virginal Pamela Anderson. Since it's only 82 minutes long, the film zips by and doesn't feel repetitive and makes you feel dumber, (like Jackass, for instance).

However, the film is also a sharp satire on America, with many scenes revealing the reality of the country. Among the people Borat comes in contact with, are Christian fanatics, Rodeo cowboys, feminists, and high society. The satirical elements alone make this film better than most films.

Borat will be released in theatres on November 3 and I recommend you don't eat before the screening, because it's probable that you're going to puke those nachos as you laugh and cry at the hilarity on screen.

Subheadline: Food:  Panya Thai ~ 520 NE 167 St. ~
Author: Lalinda De La Fuente / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The minute people find out that I am half Thai they ask me the same question, "Where is the best place to eat Thai food?" Although there is an array of decent Thai restaurants that dot the Greater Miami area, few stand out as more authentic fare. Panya Thai in North Miami Beach may be unfussy and low-key but the food has an authentic flare that few others are able to boast about.

Panya's relaxed atmosphere and characteristically soft-spoken Thai waitresses both lend well to a pleasant Thai experience. If you don't frequent Thai restaurants, their small staff will be more than happy to explain the dishes and alter them to suit your taste buds.  Don't be scared by the notion that Thai food is extremely spicy. Although Thai people prefer the bite of hot peppers, practically any dish can be made on a milder scale and yet still retain its flavor.

Panya's menu is extensive, offering food that is accessible to both the play-it-safe individual and the bold eater. Its appetizers range from the everyday to dishes that even I was surprised to find they offered. Its beef or chicken satay (thin slices of meat on skewers) is the perennial favorite, but other appetizers offer a more novel experience.

The papaya salad is a favorite and often a hard find on Thai menus in Miami. This salad includes shredded unripe green papaya with tomatoes, peanuts and lime juice. This salad plays off the coupling of unexpected flavors, both sweet and salty. For the spice addict, add dried chili for a seriously potent kick. Other appetizers that stand out are its fish cakes and pan-fried mussels, which both offer an authentic taste of Thailand.

Panya's main courses offer everything from the vegetarian friendly tofu to the more expensive frog legs or soft shell crabs. Its curries are exceptional, offering patrons their choice of four different types. Its massaman curry has snow peas, carrots, pineapple onions and peanuts and can be made with everything from chicken or pork to shrimp or fish.  This particular curry embodies an Indian influenced taste, robust and rich. For more typical Thai flavored curries, their red and green ones are the way to go. Both are made with coconut milk and mixed vegetables but the red has a stronger kick than its milder counterpart green.

Curries are a gutsy way to go if it's your first time trying the fare. Try their dishes with basil, ginger or pepper sauce for equally flavorful dishes. Make sure to also try their Thai iced tea or coffee. These drinks are served over ice with condensed milk for a rich chilled treat. Its coconut ice cream is made in the traditional Thai manner; a scoop of delectable ice cream with peanuts sprinkled across the top and bites of Thai fruits nestled at the bottom.

Although slightly pricey with entrees running between 10 and 20 dollars, Panya Thai stands out with its authentic Thai fare and extensive selection suited to people with all tastes.

Restaurant expenses are paid for by the writer. The restaurant has no prior knowledge of the writer's presence.

Subheadline: Music: Citizen Hope - Every Waking Moment
Author: Samantha Quinon / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you regularly watch television, you have probably heard of Citizen Cope, a.k.a. Clarence Greenwood. In 2004 his music was featured in a Pontiac commercial, and he's been steadily gaining support from commercial radio ever since. 

If you haven't heard of Citizen Cope, picking up their newest album, Every Waking Moment, is not a good way to introduce yourself. But, if you think you'd like hip hop-infused urban blues-rock a bit reminiscent of Everlast and Arrested Development and rounded out by Greenwood's smooth John Legend-esque pacing, by all means pick up their lively self-titled debut. Sadly, since then Greenwood has been gradually losing his creativity, and Citizen Cope's new album is leagues below its two predecessors. 

In the first track, "Back Together," Greenwood and his band couldn't pick a style, so they haphazardly borrowed from genres only to wind up sounding confused.

The good news is that the first track is the most musically ambitious, so the ones that follow sound markedly better … until you sit down and listen to the whole album in one sitting. Greenwood has never been a strong lyrist, and his skills degenerate with each successive album. As the group becomes better known his lyrics grow less narrative and colorful as they are stripped down to banal, generic choruses in an attempt to draw a wider commercial audience. 

The worst example of this the last track, "Left for Dead;" the entire chorus is "A, E, I, O, U." And no, Greenwood isn't joking. It makes you wish this unintentional humor came at the middle of the album to break up the monotony of the other less humorous choruses, which eventually evolve into the only lyrics for their song. 

The only bright spots on Every Waking Moment are the musical arrangements. Few groups can pull off hip-hop infused blues-rock well, and while Citizen Cope is close, close doesn't make a good album.

Although the music arrangements are beautifully simple with perfect, not overly percussive beats, the instruments sometimes fail. Many tracks feature synth strings and a synth Hammond, which blur the sound, though they would have sounded fantastic if Greenwood had shelled out a little cash to get the real thing. This is evident on the entirely instrumental tenth track, "Awe." There are no synthetic sounds or layering, and the band's talent is showcased in a jazzy, finger-snapping, horn and cymbal-infused four-minute arrangement. It is also painfully out of place. There is no hip hop or blues or rock or folk on this track. This is jazz, wonderfully pure jazz, and it's a sore thumb.

So the best track is a sore thumb, and the rest of the songs are forgettable. They can also be teases, so beware. Just when you think you've found a high point it grates on for two tiresome minutes. But the initial rush of hearing something so promising will be just enough to raise your hopes that Citizen Cope will get it right on the next track, only they never do.

Subheadline: Telling someone they stink - a public service
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Having consistently good personal hygiene is a life-long goal that I would put right up there with winning the lottery or working for Rolling Stone. For some, however, taking the time to roll a stick of deodorant underneath the arm is like wasting time to tie your shoes when you're late for class. I'm not passing judgment, though. America is the land of the free and smelling rancid is some unwritten right in the constitution, along with laughing too loud at a movie theater or asking a bank teller 16,000 questions when clearly there's a long line behind you.

There is, however, a limit to the madness. Didn't someone important once say the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few? If you're working in an enclosed office with recycled air being pumped out of the vents and you smell like a youth fair pony ride, this is unacceptable. And no matter what the Constitution says or doesn't say about smelling bad, air pollution is a very real amendment punishable by law.

Telling someone they stink is a sensitive issue. When you say, "Your smell hurts my nose," it's comparable to "Your face hurts my eyes." Both of these statements end with the speaker hitting the floor in a one-punch K.O. Therefore, tact is key. You can make it seem as though it's not the offender's fault and blame it on yourself. Express concern when you mention "I left my lunch of milk and old cheese outside in the baking sun for the past few days - you didn't happen to fall in it, did you?" You can even offer to check their shoes. 

If you're not a fan of direct confrontation, perhaps a brief business memo will do the trick. Here's an example: "Dear sir (or madam), I couldn't help but notice that your unique and pungent aroma is starting to peel the wallpaper off of the interior of this office. Let's work together to alleviate this problem. Remember, there's no "I" in "team," but there is a "u" in "oblivious" - which is what I fear you are to this very serious topic." 

In this short life it's necessary to do your fair share of philanthropy. It's good for karma and to seal you a spot in heaven. Maybe it's this kind of good deed that could erase that time you kicked a puppy for amusement.

When tact is difficult to achieve, it doesn't mean you have to suffer silently. You can always circumvent ever talking about the situation. Maybe as a secret Santa gift you can get the offender a fancy hygiene kit from Bath Beyond Secret Works or whatever. This is probably one of the only true examples of a gift that keeps on giving.

Use your resources to your advantage. I know that college freebie fairs give out mini-sticks of deodorant. You can approach the offender with, "Hey, look what I got in GC!" and offer the person one, or five or as many sticks as you can carry.

You know things have really gotten bad when you start coughing violently as your coworker reaches past you for a stapler. 

If things really get desperate you can always mail this drawing to the offender. I think it's to the point:

If anything, I hope this article can be a catalyst for action, or at least, discussion. You can always clip this article out of this newspaper and give it to the offender attached with a note that reads: "Hey Bob! Read this funny article. Aren't you glad we don't know anyone with this problem? Haha!" 

Just don't forget to cut off this paragraph. I can't be held liable for that. Good Luck.

Headline: Homesick students find comfort in nostalgia
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's a sentiment found in the kindergartner going to school for the first time, or in the third grader headed to summer camp, or even in the adult who spends countless hours on planes and in hotels on business. But perhaps the feeling hits no demographic harder than college students leaving home for the first time: homesickness. 

Not only can everyone relate to homesickness, but also it has been a motif in ancient literature. In Homer's Odyssey and other epics, the hero is motivated by homesickness to brave countless foes, mainly to reach the peace and comfort of "home." Chances are that homesick FIU students haven't exactly had the drama of braving any foes recently just to go back home for a visit, but admitting that the move to Miami has brought on nostalgia is the first step in getting over homesickness and moving on. 

Senior Melissa Hernandez, who moved from Chicago to Miami last year, first experienced homesickness when she realized that she was missing out on regular family activities.

"I hadn't really gotten homesick at all until today when I found out my entire family was at a White Sox game and I was 1200 miles away," Hernandez said. "What makes me most homesick is hearing that friends and family back home are doing something that I can't do here in Miami such as going to Sox games and raking leaves."

At first, the causes of homesickness seem obvious - it means missing the people and things you love fueled by being thrust into a completely new environment. Naturally one would rather be around what's familiar and comfortable instead of making the extra effort of getting used to something new. But homesickness is even connected to some deeper identity issues, as some research has claimed. When one is homesick in a completely new world, that's when people start asking, "Where are you from?," "Why are you here?" and "Do you like it here?" It's the time to make some decisions about who you are, and who you aren't. 

 English Senior Reshma George had never been very far from home for long until Spring 2006, when she decided to leave the Pacific island of Guam and become an exchange student here at FIU. She chose FIU because as soon as she saw "international" in the name, George knew it could offer the kind of diversity she was looking for. She's excited to be here, but now it's her second semester and as some of the novelty wears off, homesickness creeps in.

"This semester I've worked at the front desk [in housing]," George explained. "Seeing parents checking in with students, I know I don't have that. I don't have anyone in Florida." 

Because Guam is on the other side of the world, she's excited that she gets to go home for Christmas, especially since most of her friends get to go home much more often than she does. 

"I miss my Mom's cooking, home-cooked Indian food," she said. 

For college students, the definition of homesickness can be misleading because a homesick student doesn't necessarily want to go back home. Usually students have left home out of their own choosing and probably made the decision expecting a certain degree of homesickness. Not only that, but some students often don't even return to their hometowns after graduating, which means that homesickness is a part of life's natural progression, and that most people consider it worthwhile. 

George agrees.

"It's not that I miss things so much that I want to go back. I'm content here," she said. "That's how I know what's important to me and what's still important to me. I learned a lot coming here, especially coming from a small island where I knew everything and everyone."

When students do go through those moments of longing for home, it's important to identify what will help them move on, since this varies for everyone. Some find it comforting to go home often, while others find that this keeps them from adjusting to their new environment. Similarly, some need those extra-frequent phone calls to Mom and Dad, while others feel better if they're more immersed in their new atmosphere. 

To cope with her feelings of homesickness, Hernandez does activities that remind her of her times in Chicago.

"To make myself feel better, I usually cook some Mexican food and watch or read up on Chicago sports teams," Hernandez said.

Regardless of how you decide to overcome your feelings for home, it may be a good idea to join several campus organizations that fit your interests and will help build your new support system. Try to consider what you would miss most about Miami if you moved again. Think about what it is you most appreciate about this new "home away from home."

Headline: Professors gain esteem through written works
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
The idea of writing a book is monumental in itself because it might herald fame and fortune. But for professors Lester Standiford and James W. Hall, the real joy of their art doesn't come from the thrill of a fan recognizing their name or face on the street - it comes from the personal gratification of being able to carve out a  provocative story for others to read.

"I feel very fortunate to have published as many books as I have, and I think if I'm able to tell someone a good story and get them to think from time to time, then I've done my job," said Standiford, who is the director of the creative writing program and an English professor. 



HALL'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS



Hall, an English and creative writing professor, agreed that fame is not the most rewarding part of being an author.

"The personal rewards of success are not as satisfying or nourishing as doing the work and writing the books," he said.

The two professors have many things in common career-wise. They have written almost the same number of books, and they both like to write mystery novels, among other things. However, each professor has expressed their individual talents in different ways, and has accomplished different things that range from writing non-fiction and columns in newspapers, to even having a book turned into a movie.

Hall scored his first book contract after an agent read a short story he had published in a literary magazine. The agent approached Hall and asked if he had written any novels. The agent was in luck, because Hall happened to have written one.

He published his first novel, "Under Cover of Daylight," in 1987. The novel is noteworthy not only because it would be the first of 20 books he would go on to write, but because he introduced a character that would become so popular, he would feature him in eight other novels.

 "Under Cover of Daylight" introduces Thorn, a hermit living in Key Largo who has a dark secret hidden within his past. In the novel, this secret "explodes out into the open," and Thorn has to "come out of his shell," Hall explained.

The most recent novel Hall is publishing is "Magic City," which is scheduled for release March 1, 2007. It is about Thorn getting involved in a political intrigue in Miami. The novel begins in 1964 and although it is fictional, it is anchored in real events. 

Although he primarily writes mysteries and thrillers, Hall has shown diversity in his writings by publishing four books of poetry, one collection of short stories and one book of essays. Hall also wrote a column for the Sun-Sentinel from 1998 to 2002. He later put these columns together and published them in 2001 under the title, "Hot Damn."

Currently, Hall is working on his 15th novel, titled "Hell's Bay." In the book, Thorn, who usually makes a living out of tying fishing flies, takes on a new job in a houseboat taking people on fishing adventures in the back corners of the Everglades.

Hall said he identifies with his loner character, Thorn. 

"I like to tie my little fishing flies and do my art and stay apart from the world, but like Thorn, who keeps getting dragged back into the world, the book business forces me to come back into the world on a regular basis," he said.

Hall also talked about how writing can be "a very private, lonely business," and yet, writers have to sometimes put their privacy aside and deal with the public.

"You want the books to be read, but it sort of runs contrary to most writers' personalities, me included. We have to deal with the public-speaking part of the business," he said.

Aside from sometimes having to give up his Thorn-like love for privacy, Hall enjoys what he does. 

"It has been a great job, a perfect job. I was able to carve out a nice career in both academics and in the novels," he said. "I've done alright; I've saved my money. I'm happy."



STANDIFORD'S FEATS



Standiford made his debut as an author in 1991, when he published his novel, "Spill." The book is about a biological warfare spill in Yellowstone National Park. Standiford obtained his inspiration for the novel from working one summer as a ranger at Yellowstone taking tolls at the gate while he was in graduate school at the University of Utah.

"I loved the park, but I wanted to call attention to how fragile it really is," Standiford said.

Spill caught the attention of a Hollywood producer, Aschok Armitraj, who wanted to turn the book into a feature film. Standiford was hired to write the screenplay, and in 1996, "Spill" was introduced to the big screen. The movie was directed by Allan Goldstein and starred Brian Bosworth.

The final product of the film did not please Standiford, who said that for about the first 10 minutes, the movie is "not bad."

"Once you sell your book, it's in the hands of the director and you just hope for the best," he said. "I think everyone tried their best, but I don't think they had enough money to stage everything in the book. I liked Bosworth, he was pretty good. He was the best thing about it." 

Standiford, however, was proud of his accomplishment.

"It's hard enough to publish a book, let alone get one made into a movie," he said. "I feel I was fortunate enough to go through the process. It's very interesting."

Aside from having written 10 crime and mystery novels, Standiford has also expanded his writing repertoire to include five works of non-fiction. 

"Non-fiction is where I am right now, but that could always change," Standiford said.

In October, Standiford's short story anthology, written by Miami writers (including Hall), will be released in trade paperback format. "Miami Noir" will be featured at the Miami Book Fair International this November.

"I wanted to help showcase the talent that is at work here in this city," he said.

Standiford's current project is a work of non-fiction called "Washington Burning," which is about the first terrorist attack on American soil. He hopes to release it by next year.

Subheadline: Some feel stereotypes linger after high school do
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
Nerd, geek, slut, jock, stoner, preppy, goth and cheerleader are some of the many stereotypes that were commonplace in high school. But do these labels still exist at the college level? According to Dionne Stephens, the associate chair of psychology, they do not. At least not in the same way they existed at the high school level. 

"In high school you do what you like," Stephens said. "When you get to college, it's not like that anymore.

Indeed, in high school you were basically thrown in a box with the same exact people day in and day out for four years. It's natural to gravitate toward others that share your same interests, thus forming those little cliques of nerds, jocks and blondes. Therefore being stereotyped was commonplace.

"The problem with stereotypes is that it's very broad in terms of predictable behavior," Stephens said. A stereotyped person can have many contradictory points in their personality that go against the stereotype. However, this does not mean the person will no longer be stereotyped. 

At the college level, students are basically adults pursuing their own lives and have much more freedom than they ever had in high school. Rather than only associate with those that have similar interests, college students tend to branch out and no longer maintain the fade they once donned in high school. 

Yet social pressure and a desire to fit in also pushes students to form groups and join clubs, and even at the college level negative stereotypes can still continue to linger.

On campus the strongest stereotype that does seem to exist is the one surrounding fraternities and sororities.

"A lot of people think I'm a bully and do nothing but get drunk," said sophomore Riquet Caballero, a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.

According to Caballero, being in a fraternity is really about being in a group. The group tries to do as much community service as possible.

"We do party, but it's not like what you see in the movies," Caballero said. 

Sorority members also tend to be negatively stereotyped.

"People assume you're an airhead," said Sophomore Cindy Torres, a member of the Sorority Alpha Omicron Pi. "It's really about networking and meeting a lot of new people on top of the community service."

Some students expect the worst when they transition into college, but at times those notions are unfounded.   

"I thought there would be a lot of stereotyping, but there is not," said freshman Junior Nunez. 

For some, the less structured nature of college life can be surprising. 

"It's a lot more laid back. People don't do it like they did in high school," said freshman Alexandra Casanova. 

Some, however, think students continue to stereotype. Take the group of male students who hang around in the Graham Center playing video games. In passing, one would assume they are nerds playing a video game all day. But for those who take the time to talk to them one-on-one will realize they are just students passing time in between classes. 

"A lot is based on how you look," said senior Robin Butkovitz. "If you deviate from the normal appearance, people assume things about you."

While stereotypes are not as prominent as they were when you were in high school, they still linger. If you take a walk around campus it's likely you'll see a group you won't find hard to label.

"We use stereotypes to help us categorize others and understand the world better," Stephens said. 

 At best, higher education is a form of learning to view events and people in a new light. So before you go assuming the jock is an airhead or the sorority girl is a bimbo, go talk to them. You may discover something new.

Headline: Workshop to strengthen leadership in University
Author: Ana Davis and Eddith Sevilla / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Association members Edgard Izaguirre and Gabriel Labrador, along with other SGA members from across the country, came together for the four-day 2006 American Student Government Association summit in Washington, D.C.

"Gabriel and I attended many different workshops so that we wouldn't miss out on important things. Then we talked about what we did and what we learned and thought about what ideas would apply to our University," said Izaguirre, current elections commissioner for SGC-BBC.

The conference, which was designed to strengthen student governments in colleges and universities around the nation, was composed of various workshops and trainings.

For example, "Setting Up Agendas," a workshop geared to emphasize the importance of setting priorities in an SGA agenda and "Leaving a Lasting Legacy for Student Government," geared to identify tangible and reasonable goals that will ensure members leave a legacy on their campus, among others.

Labrador, at-large representative of SGA and speaker of the house, had the opportunity to learn various things at the many workshops he attended.

"At the 'Get More Publicity and Improve Media Relations' workshop I learned that to improve advertising, it is important for SGA to develop a brand name and master smart advertising," Labrador said. 

"At the 'Empower: How to Get It and Use It' workshop, I learned that power is a tangible element. It is the ability to influence decisions and the control of resources; and all this is just the tip of the iceberg."

Among the issues presented, Izaguirre was very interested in online voting for SGA elections, an option that the council may take into consideration.. 

"Online voting would allow the student body to vote for their representatives from their homes. This would not only benefit our student involvement, but students would be more aware that we exist," said Izaguirre. 

Different guest speakers were also present at the summit, including Sean C. Stephenson, member of the board of directors for the National Association of Self Esteem and one of Izaguirre's greatest inspirations at the conference.

"He has a rare disorder, but despite his barrier, he accomplished so much," said Izaguirre. "That showed me that it is important to appreciate all that we have and use our assets to accomplish great things."

Workshops were not all the members benefited from; networking was also something they took advantage of.

"We were able to bond with other people from the United States and make more friends intimately. We helped each other on how to improve each other's SGA," Izaguirre said.

The information the members obtained from the summit will be presented during SGC-BBC's next meeting scheduled for Sept. 27 at 3:30 p.m. in the Wolfe University Center, room 155.

"We encourage students to come out to the meeting and discuss issues that directly impact how their school life is because we are hoping to be able to take other insights from student governments across the nation and build them upon the success that BBC has had over the past few years," Labrador said.

Headline: Women's Center hosts retreat
Author: Nicole Acosta and Yolanne Almanzar / Beacon Staff

For Gloria Bauta, senior and Women's Studies major, nothing seemed as absolutely blissful as a weekend away with the girls at the first ever Sisterhood Retreat, sponsored by the Women's Center at FIU.

"It's going to be a great opportunity to create solidarity among women on campus-an opportunity you get only in the dorms," Bauta said. 

Bauta is going to be representing Stonewall Pride Alliance and the National Organization for Women.

The event will take place from Oct. 13 through Oct. 15. 

There will be 30 slots available for students to travel to Apoka, Florida, for the weekend to take part in beautiful scenery, interesting conversations that will last late into the night and even some yoga. Of course, no boys are allowed - only women can attend.

Although the event is free due to funding from the Student Government Association, a deposit of $15 during the time of registration is required in the form of a check in order for students to reserve their spot.  The money will be refunded during the retreat.

Suzanne Onorato, associate director of the Women's Center, said the retreat is a great opportunity for students personally and professionally.

"It gives them the chance to develop a sisterhood community. In doing that, it will empower the women to grow in their own development and in developing relationships across campus," she said.

The retreat is under the direction of Tara Warshaw, graduate assistant for the Women's Center. She hopes the event will serve as a learning experience the participants can learn from and then utilize what they learn outside of the retreat.

"You have to learn about yourself and have your own identity before you can learn from others and what they have to offer," Warshaw said. 

"If they really appreciate what we're doing with the retreat, hopefully they [will] take stuff away from it and use it in their everyday lives."

The Women's Center's goal is to empower women by providing programs that stimulate their intellectual, professional, social and emotional growth. 

The creation of the Sisterhood Retreat is an extension of the services already offered by the center, such as mentoring programs, women's forums and special interest groups, set in a more intimate, concentrated locale and without any distractions, Bauta said.

Warshaw agreed.

"We wanted to get women the women to get away from FIU in order to explore their bodies, themselves, and explore their personalities," Warshaw said.

The retreat is currently being planned by a host of student leaders from several on-campus organizations, such as University Park student housing, the Women's Center in both UP and Biscayne Bay Campus, Multicultural Programs and Services, the Women's Studies Student Association, the Graduate Student Association and Stonewall.

"If we're going to make an event that students enjoy, we want to involve them in the planning process," Onorato said.

These leaders, which include Bauta, came together at a meeting on Sept. 20 at the UP Women's Center office to brainstorm and plan some of the activities for the retreat. 

The activities planned for the event are being kept a secret in order to surprise the participants.

However, it was revealed that the workshops for the retreat are going to deal with day-to-day issues such as body image, health, sexuality and spirituality.

"These workshops are going to be about understanding who you are as an individual and as a woman and working with the women in a group," Warshaw said.

On multiple occasions, the activities of the retreat will encourage the women to detail things they would like to accomplish for themselves. 

The retreat will also challenge the participants to define their own personal value system and explore how their beliefs can be a catalyst for change at the university. 

"Putting together women of different backgrounds in so close of an environment will in and of itself challenge the students and what their preconceived notions are," Bauta said.

"We're almost asking students to set out of their comfort zone and really explore themselves," Warshaw said.

There will also be outdoor activities throughout the event, such as kayaking, bike riding and yoga.

"We want very much to integrate a creative workout with a physical workout," Bauta said. 

Sophomore Rachel Alexander is also going to be one of the leaders of the retreat. 

She is not only helping to come up with icebreakers and form a menu, but she will also be an active participant, learning and growing along with everyone else who attends.

"I'm looking forward to learning about myself and growing as a woman and learning about my strengths and weaknesses," Alexander said.

The aspect of leadership is what the Women's Center regards as central to the future success of the Sisterhood Retreat.

"The university is investing a lot in them," Onorato said.  "We want to see them give back."

Sophomore Sarah Cadwallader is already planning on attending the Sisterhood Retreat after learning about it in her Introduction to Women's Studies class.

Though she has never been to any of the events offered by the center, the retreat has piqued her interest. 

"It seemed like an excellent opportunity to bond with your fellow sisters and have a great time," Cadwallader said.

Bauta hope students like Cadwallader will really take advantage of such an opportunity.

"Women in our society don't traditionally have a place to develop their leadership skills, and having that time and space away from the patriarchy gives them the resources that they need to really let their power shine though," Bauta said.
