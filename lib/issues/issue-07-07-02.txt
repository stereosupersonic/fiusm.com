Headline: A Model of Health: a wellness column
Subheadline: Model discusses portions, food pyramid
Author: Sandra Mateu / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Although I am a student majoring in print journalism, health is  something I take very seriously, especially as a model.

Having danced ballet, flamenco, salsa and hip-hop,  I like to maintain a healthy lifestyle for three reasons: my activities demand it, being healthy makes me feel good and my mom said so. 

Aside from placing me in extracurricular physical activities, my mom also taught me to eat well. As they say, "Mom knows best." She taught me to eat three meals a day with two snacks between each meal; eating five times a day but in smaller portions. 



Portions, what 

about them? 



According to Yolanda Santisteban, a nurse practitioner from the student health services department at the Biscayne Bay Campus, meals should be taken in measured portions.

"You need to have breakfast as a king or queen, then have lunch as a prince or princess and end the day having dinner as a homeless person," Santisteban said.

Long starvation slows your metabolism causing weight gain, while digestion helps burn calories and keeps the metabolism going, Santisteban said. 

If you are satisfied after finishing your meal, you are not going to overeat later. This is an important rule that justifies why many diet programs try to include the foods you like, so you are satisfied and not feeling like you are missing out. 

"Today we talk about high and low density foods. High-density food is the one we need to avoid. [Although] it is a small portion in size, [it's] big in calories like a hamburger. A low-density food is a big portion in size but low in calories, like a salad," Santisteban said. 



Let's Get Physical!



Exercising also plays a big part in a healthy diet. According to the American Heart Association, you need to burn as many calories as you consume and be physically active. It recommends 30 minutes of physical activity per day. 

If you think about it, 30 minutes is not that much. 

If you watch any of today's reality shows, it would take you 30 minutes to maybe an hour. 

If you watch a baseball game, it could take at least three hours of your day, and if you watch "24" you can be sitting down in front of that TV the whole day!

 There are no excuses for failing to live a healthy life. Money shouldn't be a problem. Exercising does not mean having to join a gym and pay a monthly fee. You can wash your car, walk your dog, clean your house, swim while getting a great tan or enjoy the gym the University offers.

Each campus has features such as a fitness center, pool, tennis and basketball courts. You can also join any of the team sports events like volleyball, baseball, basketball, soccer, etc. 



Dollar Days no more



If you think the dollar menu, the value menu and the super value menu are the best inventions ever, you are not on the right track. 

You can always buy grocery items beforehand and prepare your meals; it will be less expensive and healthier. 

I also suggest buying fruits when they are in season; they taste better and cost less. 

 Yogurts, cereals, dried fruits, whole grain breads and energy bars are also great snacks. 



Use The Food Pyramid



How much should we eat from each group? Proteins should be the size of a deck of cards. You should always eat it baked, boiled, roasted or steamed. Proteins are meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs and nuts. 

Carbohydrates like breads, cereals, pasta and rice should be whole wheat or whole grain. You can have anywhere from six to eleven servings a day and avoid soft drinks and keep an eye on the amount of sugar in the juices you consume. Drinking eight glasses of water a day is very beneficial as well.  



Anti-Couch Potato



Sometimes we do not have the time to prepare our own food or hit the gym because of everyday things like homework, parties and our significant other, but the truth is that living a healthy lifestyle is essential to our well being. 

Now, if you want to fit into that bikini or simply have more energy, get off that couch and get to work!

Headline: Copycat Control: Site Scans for Plagiarism
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Professors who assign research papers as a high percentage of their grading policy constantly struggle with the possibility of their students violating one of the most unforgiving policies at any learning institution: plagiarism - a problem one researcher decided to correct. 

John Barrie, along with other researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, created a series of computer programs to detect when research papers were being recycled in their large undergraduate classes. 

From those programs came Plagiarism.org, the world's first Internet-based plagiarism detection service.

The site eventually spawned Turnitin.com and iThenticate.com, which automatically scan documents for any copied passages. 

"I use Turnitin.com to prevent plagiarism," said Devrim Altinoz, an adjunct faculty member of the history department. "I also use it to teach students to not just use the Internet as a source."

Altinoz says Turnitin.com has helped her find several cases where students' papers were completely or partially plagiarized.

"It becomes such a dilemma," Altinoz said. "They didn't think they were plagiarizing or claimed they didn't know what they were doing."

The use of such programs and the severity of the violations are at the discretion of the professors. Altinoz, who teaches world civilizations, looks at each case of plagiarism on a case-by-case basis. 

If she determines a student unintentionally plagiarized a small portion of his or her paper, she will allow them to rewrite it.

 In the cases where students clearly plagiarized their entire paper, however, she follows FIU policy and reports them to the administration.  

Altinoz also commented that some professors fail students even if they unintentionally plagiarize a small portion of any paper and they report said students to the administration. 

Although it may seem harsh, it is completely within the authority of professors to fail students who plagiarize, even if they do so unintentionally. 

FIU has several sanctions for plagiarism, ranging from failing the assignment in question to being expelled from the institution. 

"It usually does not rise to the level of expulsion," said Vice Provost of Academic Affairs Kenneth Johnson. "Though there have been a number of suspensions."

Suspensions due to plagiarism usually last a semester to a full year, according to Johnson. 

Despite the usefulness of Turnitin.com, many professors, like English professor Christina Machado do not use the system for several reasons such as disliking the interface, keeping grading at a more personal level or simply disagreeing with the availability of their students' work to the public and the rules that are carried out by Turnitin.com that state that all essays that are reviewed on the web site for plagiarism become the property of the web site. 

"I don't like it," Machado said. "You can detect plagiarism yourself."

According to Machado, a student can refuse to turn in a paper to Turnitin.com in order to maintain their ownership, although, in such a case, could be forced to switch to another class. 

When asked, Turnitin.com's phone support said that when students submit their papers to the web site, the site does not retain ownership of the paper but will keep it circulated in its database. 

However, one section from the user agreement policy found on the web site suggests otherwise, stating, "All services, content, data, information and other materials on or directly accessible from the site are owned by iParadigms, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors and/or vendors." 

With that said, a student can, hypothetically, plagiarize themselves if they submit a paper to Turnitin.com and choose to make references to that paper in a second assignment.

Even though these web sites could strike fear in many students, others such as freshman Cristina Loreto feel that the web site is effective in curbing the copying of others' ideas.  

"I think it's a good way to create original work," said Loreto. "The fact that you know a teacher could fail you or be kicked out of school is a great incentive not to plagiarize."

Headline: Student employment available in heart of University
Author: Kassandra Pool / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With fuel prices on the rise and a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule looming, students looking for a flexible job schedule can find numerous opportunities on campus that do not compromise study time and gas money. Here are some jobs that are available in the center of campus life: The Graham Center. 



Bookstore Starting Salary: $6.67 per hour

To work at the bookstore, prospective employees have to go through a 20-minute orientation to introduce them to the job environment. If the students are still interested, an interview time is given to them where the Assistant General Manager, Phredd Hunter, determines whether the student meets the position's qualifications, mainly toward customer-friendliness. Once the student is hired they undergo 2-3 weeks of training.

About 100-175 students are hired a month before the actual semester. Out of those 175 students only a handful continue working for the bookstore for the remainder of the year.

As a bookstore employee, students sometimes have the chance to meet an administrator face-to-face such as former employee Rosalyn Delgado, who had the opportunity to assist Modesto A. Maidique.

"I know exactly what Mr. Maidique, the President actually likes as a candy bar - he likes Twix, king size. And one day, to think our President didn't have enough cash on him, I had to pay the remaining amount for his king size Twix."



Computer Lab & Audio VisualStarting Salary: $8 per hour

The computer lab, where students go to study or simply pass the time between classes, requires that their employees have basic experience and knowledge with computers as well as a friendly disposition in order to help other students. According to Sanyo Mathew, coordinator of computer applications, during a typical semester a computer lab assistant works 20 or fewer hours per week. If the lab's employees need more hours, they are allowed to do more then the standard 20 hours during the summer.

According to Andre Rodriguez, the coordinator for audio/visual services, an A/V employee primarily sets up the equipment needed for events on and around campus. Equipment such at projectors, laptops, microphones, screens and the audio system has to be set by the time the event begins. Afterward, they speak with the customer to make sure all their needs were met.

Current A/V employee Jephren Perez has been able to manage work as both as a computer lab assistant and as an A/V employee.

"I do primarily audio/visual work, so my first event that I did was when Dan Marino was here giving a speech for the football team -- it was kind of cool, I got to talk to him and after that I've gotten to meet everyone from Gloria Estefan to Andrew Card, former Chief of Staff of the White House." 



Information Desk

Starting Salary: $7.50 per hour



Students wanting to give their fellow classmates directions around campus and get paid for it can work at the GC information desk, where they can be referred to by faculty and staff members or by applying at the GC Main Office; international students have priority because they are only allowed to work on campus. According to GC Executive Director Ruth Hamilton, customer-friendly people who are even-tempered, high spirited and self-assured are ideal candidates for the job. 

Current info desk employee Martha Lopez, has had the opportunity of being recognized as one of the former contestant of the television show "Nuestra Belleza Latinas."

 "I get recognized by a bunch of people on campus. People come up to me and are like 'Oh My God! You are that chick on that show.' 

Besides meeting fans, she also makes them feel right at home, which is one of the goals the GC keeps in mind when hiring their employees, according to Hamilton.

Hamilton wants the students to feel right at home and tells her employees, "You are here not just to do the A/V or custodial, no! You are here for the spiritual and emotional part of the students, because you are the one who's going to bring the sunshine to them, so they [the employees] are the sunshine." 

There are also other jobs on campus outside of the GC including positions in the Green Library, the Ryder Business Building and the Recreation Center. 	Visit www.fiujobs.org for available job positions.

Headline: Review: Halo 3 Beta (Game)
Author: Kevin Castro / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This past May, developer Bungie Software and publisher Microsoft released the most anticipated, Xbox live-play-only game this year, Halo 3 Beta, a public beta for the highly anticipated Halo 3 being released Sept. 25, 2007. 

To keep gamers in suspense until the launch of Halo 3, the beta does not offer a storyline, but it does give a slight, but majestic preview of what you can expect in the final release - new and fun vehicles, weapons and features that were not present in the previous Halo title, Halo 2.

There are three new maps: Snowbound, High Ground and the regal Valhalla. Snowbound is split into two sections: the open snowy area outside and a series of tunnels under the two bases. The level, a very open landscape, allows for the possibility of an attack from all sides. 

Luckily, the underground tunnels provide access to an array of weapons and equipment. The open-ended aspect of this map has caused it to be the most hated of the three, though - it's rare that anyone could find this map appealing.

High Ground, an asymmetrical map on top of a hill, has players often beginning their play on the attacking side of the map, where weapons such as a shotgun, a sniper rifle and a cloaking device can be found. Although the attacking team has a base, the defending team has excellent cover throughout their portion of the map. This is one of the best maps in the beta as it perfectly balances team positions and risks for reaching more powerful weapons, such as the rocket launcher found in front of a deadly gun turret.	

The final map, Valhalla, houses an assortment of vehicles and weapons such as a missile pod and Mongooses (ground reconnaissance vehicles). Valhalla is also home to the renowned "man cannon," which will shoot you hundreds of feet into the air onto the hub of the map. Out of all of the maps, this one offers the most versatile and abundant collection of battle space, weapons, equipment and vehicles.

In the beta, some of the new weapons introduced include the portable Grav Lift that allows for a quick boost skyward and the Bubble Shield that protects you from incoming fire. The coolest weapon is the Spartan Laser, which has been the talk of the beta since its press release and can annihilate anything in one hit. 

Unsurprisingly, the beta isn't perfect: there are bugs severe enough to merit the attention of Bungie - some unlucky people found themselves locked out of the game at first. Despite the bugs, the beta contains some impressive graphics, especially at such an early stage of production. 

The amazing sound effects you hear from a far away battle and the efficient use of the weapons both old and new complement the already surreal gaming experience, making the wait for the final game seem even longer.

Headline: Review: Odin Sphere (Game)
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While most video game developers are pushing the envelope for the latest 3-D imagery, there are some that still believe in using 2-D art to paint today's digital gaming landscape.  Developer Vanillaware and publisher Atlus bring us such a 2-D work of art in their latest PlayStation 2 release, Odin Sphere.

Odin Sphere's tale revolves around five individuals whose paths intertwine during a time of strife and dragons in the world of Erion.  From Gwendolyn, the Valkyrie princess of Ragnanival trying to win the approval of her father, to Oswald, the Shadow Knight serving the Fairy Kingdom of Ringford, all of the characters offer unique perspectives of the war over the Cauldron, an artifact of great power and key to a prophecy of Armageddon.

The game play is simple enough, but contains enough tricks to keep things fresh.  Movement is handled on a 2-D plane while the stages consist of circular zones that loop with exit points that lead to different sections.

  Each of the five protagonists has their own abilities and tactics in fighting monsters, from gliding to magic spells.  One key element in the game is "Phozon," an energy source left behind from slain enemies.  Phozons have multiple uses from strengthening your weapon to powering spells and even aiding in the growth of plants for producing recovery items.  Combat must also be handled with care as attacking too much or at the wrong time can leave you exposed, especially in large groups of foes.

Graphically, Odin Sphere is beautiful to admire.  The exquisite 2-D art brings the world of Erion to life.  With larger than life characters and beasts, the game's art is loaded with charm that grabs the audience like a storybook or an animated feature.  

Adding further to the atmosphere is the full orchestral score of Hiroshi Sakimoto;  musical arrangements range from grand regal processionals to thunderous war marches  The fully-voiced dialogue is offered in both English and Japanese and both are handled very well, further adding life to the character.

While the game is easy to pick up, it can be quite a challenge even early on.  Bosses are large and the enemies gather in mobs that can overwhelm in short order.  The limited inventory space and occasional in-game slowdown from so much activity onscreen can be a hindrance to the player -- load times are frequent and at times lengthy between all transitions, from new areas to scripted scenes.

While Odin Sphere has some technical flaws, the game's charm and play mechanics help make up it.  It is refreshing seeing a title like this one that shows classic 2-D gaming is still alive today. 

With consoles as powerful as they are now, Odin Sphere shows the possibilities of how far 2-D art in video games can go if developers and players are willing to embrace it.

Headline: PLANNING AHEAD: Full-year registration possible
Author: Jose Maya / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
For the first time in FIU's history, students will have the opportunity to register for two semesters at once starting this upcoming enrollment period. 

The new PantherSoft tool is part of the Classroom Space Utilization Committee's plans together with the new three-day schedule and will launch this Fall. It will give students the option of registering for Fall and Spring semester classes with only one log-in to the PantherSoft system. 

While the change is not mandatory, students who opt to register for the two semesters will only have to pay for one semester at a time. 

For now, technicalities are still being looked over.

According to Assistant Provost of Academic Affairs Elizabeth Bejar, planning and testing is being done by the registrar's office to ensure that the new registration option will run as smoothly as possible.

"The ability to plan allows students to better achieve their goals," Bejar said.

The new system is already in effect at other universities in Florida such as the University of Florida, Bejar said.

"We have consulted them and we're providing an even better product to our students." 

While the new tool is being tested, some worry about what will happen if students fail a pre-requisite or co-requisite, and when they try to register for it the following semester, the sections are full.

"That unfortunately is the danger," said Associate University Registrar Alex Collins. 

Some faculty members predict other small obstacles. 

"I have a feeling that the learning curve for everyone - faculty, students and staff especially in the registrar's office - will be slow and create tremendous confusion initially, but hopefully we'll all figure it out eventually, " said Leslie Frazier, vice-president of the FIU chapter of United Faculty of Florida.

Faculty Senate chair Bruce Hauptli doesn't think the changes will be all negative. 

"As the system changes, it brings some challenges but the successful student who had to wait before now won't," Hauptli said.

According to Phillip King, associate registrar for scheduling, there is a possibility that the new option might not be ready for the first wave of students who have early enrollment appointments. However, he believes that the system will be ready by the time the bulk of students have access to registration. 

Students may not hear more details on the new option until early July, when the University plans to communicate students the changes via e-mail, Bejar said.

"The University will be working with [the Student Government Association] to come up with ideas on how to encompass the entire aspect," said Arthur "AJ" Meyer, vice-president of the Student Government Council at University Park. He added that the SGC website is currently being updated to offer advice on registration and is expected to be ready by mid-July. 

In the meantime, Meyer encourages students to contact SGC directly with any questions regarding the changes.

Official registration by appointment will begin Aug. 2, and will open for all students Aug. 13. Visit http://www.fiu.edu/orgs/register/ for more information.

Headline: Universities develop exchange program
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
FIU and the University of Miami have decided that it's better to work together - at least off the football field.

The two universities have entered into a new exchange program that will begin in the Fall of 2007. 

Administration from both universities had positive things to say about the new program.

"This agreement magnifies the effectiveness of the curricula at both universities by building on each other's strengths," said FIU Provost and Executive Vice President Ronald Berkman in a press release.

"This partnership will allow students at UM and FIU to take advantage of the educational and research opportunities at both institutions," stated Dr. Thomas J. LeBlanc, executive vice president and provost at the University of Miami in a press release.  

According to Douglas Wartzok, FIU vice president of academic affairs, the exchange program has been in the works for six years and will be available to doctoral students only. The exchange came into being as a result of trial run programs in Latin American studies, Caribbean studies and tropical biology. Once it was determined that the exchange program could work in other areas, both administrations went ahead with implementation in all academic areas. 

Currently, there is no limit to the number of students who can participate in the exchange program, according to Wartzok. 

"Over the long run we want an equal number of exchange students at both universities," he said. 

By executing the exchange program, both universities will increase the number of available courses for their students. For example, since FIU has a larger nuclear physics program than UM, students at UM would have more luck enrolling for classes at FIU, according to Stephan Mintz, the associate dean of the graduate school.

To participate in the exchange program, students would sign up for a generic class such as 0000 UM Exchange - exact course names and numbers have not been determined. Once registered for the exchange program, students would go to UM and sign up for their actual course. The amount of classes offered at both institutions will remain the same as prior to the exchange program.

Students need no special clearance to register for classes. However, Mintz warns that either institution could deny a student's request to participate in the exchange, and that all limited-access programs are excluded from the exchange program entirely. 

"This is not meant to be a long-time thing," Mintz said. 

Mintz also commented that it is expected that doctoral students take no more than two exchange courses throughout their time of study.  

Students will only pay the fees and tuition of their home university and after completion of the course, the host institution would send the grade back to the home institution. 

Wartzok commented that even though UM is a more expensive university to attend tuition-wise, doctoral students usually pay the same amount due to various grants and scholarships. 

"The exchange program should enhance both reputations," Wartzok said when asked about the FIU-UM rivalry concerning which university has the better reputation.

Headline: Commentary: Scholarship losses add to Athletics' disastrous year
Author: Chris Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After a disastrous season for the football team resulted in a winless year, the firing of the head coach and a brawl that landed FIU onto national news for days for all the wrong reasons, the NCAA has swept through with an academic evaluation and left destruction in its wake. The damage imposed onto not only football but basketball and baseball as well.

The Academic Progress Rate is a study done over the past three years of NCAA teams that evaluates the graduation rates and academic standings of student athletes. 

FIU's performance is one to be forgotten as they will eventually lose 12 scholarships: nine scholarships in football, two in  men's basketball and one in baseball. The NCAA currently has retrieved nine scholarships from FIU. The remaining three scholarships will be lost in the Fall semester. 

FIU also finished in the bottom fifteenth percentile as a whole and the bottom 10th percentile in baseball. Add it up, and FIU has nearly lost as many scholarships as any other Division I school.

Hardly the right direction for a school that just put $31 million into renovating a stadium and intends to become an upper tier competitor across the collegiate landscape.

Finishing in the upper half of Division I schools when it comes to basic academic standards like graduation can't be that difficult, can it? It's like finishing last in the NBA Eastern Conference - you're not exactly up against the cream of crop - all you have to do is be average and you can make the finals. Go out to the western conference, though, and you'll be scraping the bottom of the barrel. This is FIU against other Division I schools; notorious for slacking in the world of academia and not exactly Ivy League caliber. 

The newcomer in the athletic department shouldn't, however, be held accountable for the sins of the former administration. While Pete Garcia may be the perfect person for the job, to begin your term handicapped because of the misdoings of the previous administration.

It is not impossible to bounce back from crippling blows from the NCAA, as FIU's friend down the street has proven. After being on probation and losing over 31 scholarships in 1996, the University of Miami came back within five years and won the national championship. And despite the criticisms it received because of past conduct, there has been a definitive improvement in grades over the past few year at UM. 

By this point it is acknowledged that FIU has enormous potential, both as an academic and athletic institution. It is easy to fall in love with South Florida and its weather, lifestyles and pure exposure that recruits can get playing at a Division I school. We may soon enough see justification for the investments made into sports. 

While the coaches and staff want nothing more than to see all their athletes graduate, it comes down to the players and whether or not they put forth effort in the classroom. 

Any talented athlete has learned from day one that not everyone makes it to the professional level, and for the vast majority this holds true until the end of their competitive athletic careers.

FIU sports, for the most part, is at a juncture right now where some of the athletes are given a chance they might not have had at some of the upper tier schools.

Not to sound like an old fogy, but would you slap your head coach in the face after he puts you into play? In turn that is what's done to the University every time it loses a scholarship because of grades. 

At least a moderate attempt must be made by the players in order to succeed. If they don't, then it is up to Garcia and the rest of the staff to weed out the dead weight and see to it that when FIU faces defeat in sports, it will be because of losing to the better team, not defeating themselves in the classroom.

Headline: Commentary: To no surprise, Blazers choose Oden with first pick
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In 1984, arguably the best ever, Michael Jordan, was an early pick in the NBA Draft - second to one of the best centers ever in NBA history - Hakeem Olajuwon. That class also featured the likes of Charles Barkley, John Stockton, Otis Thorpe and Sam Perkins; pretty strong class right? 

Over a decade ago, the 1996 NBA Draft boasted what many labeled as the best draft in the history of the league. The Philadelphia 76ers drafted future Hall of Famer Allen Iverson with its top pick, in a stellar class highlighted by the now reigning league defensive player of the year Marcus Camby, two-time league MVP Steve Nash, arguably the best player on the planet today in Kobe Bryant, point guard Stephon Marbury, forward Antoine Walker and sharp shooters Peja Stojakovic and Ray Allen. 

On Saturday night in New York City, two things happened: The best collegiate basketball prospects saw their dreams come true and the world witnessed what was in my mind the deepest NBA Draft of all time. Let's break it all down by examining the early picks.

Although nine of the first 13 picks taken in the draft were forwards, the biggest buzz was undoubtedly around Greg Oden - the dominant center from Ohio State University. As expected, the Portland Trailblazers selected the seven-footer with the first overall pick. The 19-year-old stud posted modest averages of 15.7 points, 9.6 rebounds and 3.3 blocks per game in a freshman season while recovering from wrist surgery.  

Oden can be a game changer on both ends of the floor right away and as long as he improves his footwork, offensively; he should be a star in the league for many years to come. I look for his game to flourish in Portland along side reigning Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy and newly acquired shooting guard Steve Francis.  Mike Conley Jr., Oden's friend and teammate with the Ohio State Buckeyes, was selected fourth overall by the Memphis Grizzles. Conley Jr. has exceptional speed, makes good decisions and has the ability to finish in traffic. Look for him to make an impact along side center Pau Gasol in Memphis next season.

With the second overall pick, the Seattle Supersonics got the best consolation prize ever in 18-year-old swingman Kevin Durant. The six-ten, 190-pound forward was the first freshman ever to be voted the consensus National Player of the Year after leading the Big 12 Conference in scoring at 25.8 ppg, rebounding and blocked shots as the go-to-man for the University of Texas Longhorns. Durant raised some eyebrows at predraft workouts when he was unable to bench press 185 pounds. If the lanky Durant couldn't bench 100 pounds I still would have selected him. Durant is an offensive machine that handles like a point guard, rebounds like a dominant center and has unlimited range on his jumper. You can build strength, but you cannot teach the killer the instinct that Durant has.  

Joining Durant in Seattle next season will be Jeff Green - the combo forward from Georgetown University.  

Green, who is an exceptional passer for a big man, was elected 5th overall by the Boston Celtics, but was the key part of a draft night trade that sent former Sonics All-Star Ray Allen to Boston.

For the past five seasons, the Atlanta Hawks have consistently gone after forwards in the draft, and this year was no exception. 

With the third overall pick, the Hawks selected Al Horford from the two-time defending champion University of Florida Gators. At six-ten, 245, Horford has an NBA ready body. His tenacity on the boards, soft touch around the rim and maturity should blend well with a young, athletic cast in Atlanta - who used its 11th pick to grab six-three scoring guard Acie Law from Texas A & M University. 

Horford wasn't the only member of the Gators to crack the top ten in the draft. Corey Brewer, whose game is a blueprint of Scottie Pippen's, was selected 7th by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the energetic Jokim Noah will join a rising team in the Chicago Bulls after being selected ninth.

With the sixth pick the Milwaukee Bucks took its chances with seven-foot Chinese forward Yi Jianlian. 

The Charlotte Bobcats used its eighth pick to grab forward Brandan Wright from North Carolina and the Sacramento Kings picked up versatile center Spencer Hawes from Washington to round out the stellar top ten.

After an embarrassing exit from the playoffs last season, the Miami Heat traded both of its picks. With the 20th selection overall the Heat selected Jason Smith - a smooth power forward from Colorado State University, who was traded to Philadelphia minutes later for Ohio State guard Daequan Cook. 

Smith, in my mind, was a wise choice for the Heat frontline with the aging pieces of Shaquille O'Neal and Alonzo Morning. 'With their 39th pick, the Heat grabbed Bosnian center Stanko Barac but then traded him to the Indiana Pacers.

For a team that didn't even have a draft pick, the New York Knicks still managed to make draft day headlines. 

The Knicks and Blazers cut a deal that sent big man Zach Randolph along with Dan Dickau and Fred Jones to New York for guard Steve Francis and Channing Frye. The Knicks finally have a dominant offensive force on the front line to complement guard Stephon Marbury.

Look for the 12th overall pick by Philadelphia, Thaddeus Young; Julian Wright, the raw forward from Kansas who went one spot back to New Orleans; the newest Los Angeles Clipper in Al Thorton, who had a dominant senior year at Florida State; former UCLA guard Aaron Affalo, who was the 27th pick to Detroit and Nick Young, the USC guard who was selected 16th overall by Washington to all make noise in the league next season.

The 2007 NBA draft class has more potential stars and impact players than any draft preceding it.

Headline: New registration policy far from flawless
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
With the Fall semester on its way, there are many new concerns and gripes with the changes being made to registration. The upcoming three-day class schedule looks to be pretty good, with one big exception. 

My issue is not with the three-day schedule itself. Actually I love coming to FIU. Many times, I prefer to be here rather than at home. 

No, my gripe is with certain aspects of the new schedule's implementation - namely, being able to register for classes more than a semester in advance. 

Starting in Fall 2007, students will be able to register not only for that semester, but for the Spring 2008 semester as well. 

"Students at commuter schools like FIU need two things: they need predictability and they need to have a sense that they're making progress toward their degrees," Provost Ronald Berkman told The Beacon last November.

While I will agree that predictability is a good thing, when it comes to registering for classes, predictability is only possible for robots. 

For example, let's say I register for all the classes I am going to take during the Fall 2007 and Spring 2008 semesters. Fall goes well and I get A's in all my classes. Then comes Spring 2008 and all of a sudden my overall schedule has changed. 

So I go and drop the class that I know I will not be able to attend. Then to my displeasure I learn that all of the other times at which the course is offered are closed. I just lost a necessary class.  

I predict that this will be a real problem when the Spring 2008 semester approaches. Life's circumstances change too often to be forcing students to register for classes so far in advance. 

Besides schedule changes, there is the possibility of failing a prerequisite class. 

If a student signs up for a class in the spring but fails its prerequisite in the fall, that will lead to a real mess with having to retake classes or waiting to retake classes. 

But the new three-day class schedule ... it scares me. I mean what about those really small upper division classes? 

Right now, if a student runs into any kind of problem that changes their schedule from the fall to the spring, they could be forced into taking another semester at FIU. 

For example, if a senior lost just one upper division class due to their schedule changing, they would have to wait until the following semester to register for it. In other words, a semester of time lost or that could have been used for another required course. 

"That unfortunately is the danger," said Alex Collins, an  associate university registrar in an interview published in The Beacon July 2, 2007.

Registering for classes months in advance is really going to cause a problem.

It's just so competitive. Depending on what grade level you are at determines how soon you can register for classes. I don't really understand how that's fair. I say that you open registration at the same time for everyone, so that everyone gets an even shot at registering for a class.   

As much as being in college is great, I can't afford to be a student forever. 

I know I've been talking a lot about "what ifs," but they are not some minute possibility. Everything I said is likely to happen because in my experience, if something can go wrong it will. 

The only way to solve the problem is to not allow students to register for classes a semester in advance. 

It will not only be easier on the students but the administration as well; it can't be easy for any department to plan out classes that far in advance.

Though it is not a mandatory policy for students to register early for the following semester, many will do so in hopes of guaranteeing a spot due to the limited number of spaces in many classes.

At least one schedule that's been planned way in advance will work out: Burger King will remain open past 3 p.m. on Fridays. I can drown my sorrows with a king size diet coke after missing out on a class with a limited number of seats.

Headline: Editorial: Tuition increase may benefit Florida students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Florida's public universities are strapped for cash. With the state government dealing with its own financial problems, raising tuition is becoming an increasingly attractive option for our state public institutions of higher education.

After intially vetoing a 5 percent tuition hike a few weeks ago, Gov. Charlie Crist recently approved raising tuition for three universities. The University of South Florida, the University of Florida, and Florida State University will all be raising tuition prices - for now FIU has been spared.

Yet while few students are ever enthusiastic about a tuition increase (and understandably so),  such raises are justifiable. The presidents of all 11 public universities in Florida advocated tuition hikes, and while the pain of paying more for college stings, it is a neccesary and inevitable occurence.

Limited and gradual hikes in the cost of education are an important part of improving Florida's universities. 

Of course, the need for these increases must be coupled with a healthy consideration for the consequences of raising tuition too drastically. 

Furthermore, tuition hikes should also be combined with increases in financial aid. Florida students should not be priced out of their own education system. Our state's public universities are among the most affordable in the nation, and that is a good thing.

However, when a major state university (FSU) threatens to freeze enrollment for lack of sufficient funds to support continued growth, a tuition hike seems more than justified. 

It is important for Florida's students to get an excellent education at stellar universities. Hiring quality faculty members and constructing and maintaining, top quality facilities are all vital processes in making Florida's schools among the best in the nation. However, all of these things do come with a price.

There must be a balance between cost and quality, low prices and high values. It is not inconceivable for Florida to have great universities without stratospheric prices. FIU President Modesto A. Maidique is among those advocating tuition hikes, having supported the proposed and rejected 5 percent rise in tuition at all public universities in Florida. In light of this, some wonder if FIU will be next.

If and when that occurs, it is important that the increase not be too dramatic. That being said, moderate increases are inevitably neccesary in order for FIU to become tshe top tier school we all would like it to be.

After all, the consequences  of lacking  sufficient funds would be dire for students and professors alike. Those who bemoan overcrowded classes must remember that tuition increases at public universities, when managed correctly, will mean more professors and better schools. Such things are hard to argue against, and moderate increases in tuition prices will ultimately be more beneficial than negative.

Headline: Students urged to suggest, pick  lecture speakers
Author: Susana Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In past years, FIU students have seen a wide variety of speakers visit; including Pope John Paul II, civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton, former White House Chief of Staff Andy Card and acclaimed film director Spike Lee.

The Student Government Association Lecture Series, which works in collaboration with the president's office and other departments and student organizations, is responsible for bringing these speakers to FIU, and is currently looking for student suggestions for this year's lecture series.

Charlie Andrews, former SGA advisor and current director of Campus Life at University Park, said that the Student Government Councils at the Biscayne Bay Campus and at UP adopted the responsibility of organizing and funding the lecture series for the benefit of the FIU community. This allows the public to have the opportunity to gain insight from the experiences of the visiting speakers. 

"It's something different and out of your everyday routine that gives you a chance to hear someone speak [who] you would normally see on television," said Anthony Rionda, SGA's newly appointed lectures coordinator. "It makes them tangible; bringing the work students are doing here for their careers into perspective." 

According to Rionda, the student voice helps decide who is invited to speak and he encourages students to get involved with the committee by attending meetings, partaking in discussions and voicing their opinions. 

"We really want students to take advantage of this opportunity to listen, learn and ask questions," Rionda said. "Our goal is to increase awareness of these events and attendance at the lectures, and through that, increase involvement in SGA." 

According to Viviana Jordan, SGA's director of legislative affairs, lack of student participation is a major set back because the series depends on student interest and input for direction. 

"I believe that these lectures enhance students' cultural and political awareness, and serve to motivate students and encourage them to think about and discuss cultural and social issues that can serve to enrich our discourse both on and off campus," Jordan said.

In the past, visiting speakers have been selected by the members of the Lecture's Committee and based on various factors. 

According to Jordan, cost is one of the top variables. Some speakers are expensive, and their combined budget of $110,000 must be used effectively to bring in as many as possible throughout the year. Individually, UP has a budget of $66,000, while BBC has $44,000 to spend according to Rionda.

The funds necessary to pay guests are collected through the Activity and Service fees, which students pay each semester. According to Rionda, students pay $10.52 per credit for the Activity and Service fee. 

The success of the Lecture Series depends on the speaker's ability to connect with students and effective management of the program's budget to bring in a wide variety of speakers, Jordan said.

This year, in order to amplify and promote environmental awareness, the committee plans on bringing a "green" speaker as part of its "Gold + Blue = Green"; someone who will highlight environmental issues.

SGA is also interested in inviting Jeff Corwin, a wildlife biologist and conservationist who hosts the popular series The Jeff Corwin Experience and Corwin's Quest on Animal Planet.

Rionda also mentions hopes to invite University alumni and athletics-related speakers to draw attention to departments and activities at FIU. Also, he said, a major goal for this year is to bring in some of the 2008 presidential candidates to the school by working closely with Jordan. 

Though SGA plans on bringing these speakers to FIU, ideas can change at anytime as the SGA wants to see students step up with their own suggestions. 

For more information and to contribute comments and ideas, students should contact the committee at fiulectures@yahoo.com.

"We really want students to get involved and know that they can," Rionda said. "Send an email, come in and see me. The committee is open to anyone!"  

According to Andrews, it's important for students to get involved and help identify individuals who they would be interested in seeing, a point that Jordan agrees with.

"It is in the student's best interest to participate in the decision-making process since their money is involved," she said.

Headline: Events promote Greek recruitment
Author: Ever Cruz /Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Charlene Collazo does it for the sense of camaraderie.

As the Panhellenic council president, she believes there are several benefits to joining a Greek organization.

"I didn't have any siblings growing up and now I have sisters and friends with who I share beliefs," she said.

Current and incoming students will have a chance to determine whether or not they wish to become involved in Greek Life by participating in a formal rush week for fraternities and pre-recruitment events for sororities coming next week.

The fraternity rush week, July 9-13, will kick off a meet-and-greet and ice cream social geared toward male student recruitment.

Unlike most fraternities, some sororities host summer pre-recruitment, annually. While formal rush week does not begin until the Fall semester, sororities have the chance to introduce themselves to potential candidates through pre-recruitment, which began June 26 and will last throughout the summer.

Pre-recruitment events for sororities will consist of barbecues and other social events in order to recruit female students. Collazo said sororities on campus are aiming to recruit at least 500 female students.

"The purpose of the pre-recruitment events is to recruit female students to sign up for official recruitment in the fall, socialize, network and meet the girls; as well as to speak to them about what sisterhood means and letting them know benefits and goals of each sorority," she said.

After these events, interested candidates fill out an application to join one ofthe organizations. This gives the members of fraternities and sororities a chance to review and evaluate the applicants and then decide whether or not they are compatible with the values of that particular organization. 

The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, also known as Pike, will be allowed to host social events in their house this year for the first time after a two-year suspension.

Kenny Gelok, Pike president, believes that being one of the only other fraternity with a house at University Park is one of the many reason why male students should rush for Pike.

"We can provide these students with a real fraternity experience. Having a house is a huge advantage, although I don't think the fraternities without houses are at a great disadvantage," he said.

"Not having a house is sometimes a disadvantage. We would like our own house, our own space, because it represents our symbols, but we manage. We do pretty good," she said.

According to Pete Cabrera, President of Sigma Phi Epsilon, his fraternity invites potential candidates to events throughout rush week such as going out to dinner. 

For Biscayne Bay Campus students interested in joining a Greek organization, traveling to UP might have to be a necessity, since most Greek organizations are located at UP.

As of last Spring, however, the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternities did hold a recruitment event at BBC, something most fraternities have yet to do.

"We have considered setting up a rep table but we feel that it might be harder for students that go to BBC to commute to UP," Cabrera said.

Collazo said sororities have begun orientations at BBC and have recruited about nine female students so far.

"That's a lot considering a lot of people don't go to BBC," he said.

As far as requirements to join a Greek organization, potential candidates must maintain a 2.5 GPA, but according to Victor Manuel Penedo, president of the Latino-based Lambda Theta Phi fraternity, there is no mold that candidates must fit in order to be accepted into an organization.

"Our fraternity is open to anybody; anybody who wants to excel in school, people who are confident and people who join for the right reasons, not just to party," he said.

For a schedule of fraternity and sorority pre-recruitment events see calendar for July and August.


Fraternity events: 
July 9: Rush Week Begins with "Meet the Fraternities" at 6 p.m. in the Graham Center ballroom and a Greek barbecue at 9 p.m.

July 13: Rush Weeks Ends


Sorority pre-recruitment: 
July 9, "Go Greek BBQ" at 9 p.m. at the housing quad

July 25 "True Life:  I'm a Sorority Woman" at 6 p.m. in the GC ballrooms is;

August 15, "Passport to Sorority Life" at 6 p.m. in the GC ballrooms.

Headline: University bids farewell to dean
Author: Lauren Agosto / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Interim Dean of Education Judith Blucker came to FIU in 1972 as an assistant professor for the College of Education, there were five men's intercollegiate sports already approved, but none for women. By 1974, FIU had three women's intercollegiate sports: women's volleyball, softball and golf teams, all established by Blucker.

Aside from starting the teams, Blucker took on the role of coaching both the softball and volleyball teams. Over a five year period the softball team won 82 matches, while the volleyball team won 85 matches.

After serving the University for more than 30 years, "the first lady of women's athletics," as she is often referred to, leaves behind a long history of achievements.  

After being promoted to professor in 1984, Blucker has held different positions including department chairperson, assistant and associate dean in the College of Education, vice provost of Academic Affairs, interim dean of the College of Health and most recently, interim dean of the College of Education. 

"I had 15 difficult positions and/or titles. I think being Dean would rank as one of my most enjoyable because you get to work directly with the faculty and the students and, hopefully, make a positive impact on both groups," Blucker said. 

On July 1, 2003, Blucker formally retired from the position of executive vice-provost for budget and personnel, but her distance from FIU did not last long. At the request of President Modesto A. Maidique, she returned one year later as appointed consultant and chief negotiator for the University's collective bargaining process.

"Someone who has been such an integral part of this university's history as Judy, leaves a deep void," Maidique said. "But she also leaves behind a solid legacy, for which we all thank her."   

In May of last year, Blucker replaced College of Education Dean Linda Blanton and took the position of acting dean of the college at the request of Executive Vice-President and Provost Ronald M. Berkman. 

Under Blucker's leadership, the College of Education was able to recruit a concrete foundation of new faculty members. It has also made progress on several important educational projects. 

"The part I enjoyed was being able to assist faculty and staff in completing their work in the best environment possible. Because of my long-time knowledge and experience at FIU, I think I was successful in administration," Blucker said.

Blucker's position as dean of the College of Education will be filled by Luis Mirón, who provost Berkman described as "an accomplished researcher who has directed multiple public policy and school reform studies." 

Blucker plans to retire to a retirement community just south of Ocala, Florida. When asked what she will miss most about FIU, her answer was simple:

"I will miss the 'people' of FIU, the long-time staff and administrators, the faculty and the students," she said. "This university has been built by many hard-working and dedicated people and I have had the privilege of knowing and working with many of them over the past 33 years."
