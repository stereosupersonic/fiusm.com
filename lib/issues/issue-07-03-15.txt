Headline: Renowned author and journalist discusses journalists and their professional, ethical duties
Author: Christina Lemus / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
About 150 FIU students learned March 13 that being labeled a muckraker is a good thing. 

Samuel G Freedman, a Professor of Journalism at Columbia University, held a lecture on "Journalism and Democracy" at the Biscayne Bay Campus's Wolfe University Center Ballroom where he explained the role of journalists and referred to their work as "raking the muck to see the stars."

Muckraking refers to the name applied to American journalists, novelists, and critics who in the first decade of the 20th century attempted to expose the abuses of business and the corruption in politics.

According to Freedman, journalists have since taken the name and turned it into one that they should be proud of: pointing out the issues that truly matter. 

"Journalists must challenge wrongdoing and hold the government accountable when necessary. Journalism is shining a light that might be otherwise left in the dark," Freedman said.

Freedman is an author of six award winning books and was a contributing writer for the New York Times for seven years. 

His most recent book, Letters to a Young Journalist, discusses the balance journalists must find between maintaining professionalism and having a sense of humanity. 

Sponsored by the School of Journalism and Mass Communications, the lecture was held as part of the Hearst Lecture Series and in SJMC's observance of Sunshine Week-a nationally recognized week intended to raise awareness of the importance of an open government. 

Sunshine week was formed in response to some Florida legislatures who tried to make new exemptions to the state public record laws. 

In his lecture, Freedman discussed the role of journalism as finding the middle line between having empathy and maintaining professionalism. He encourages journalists to remain unbiased, do proud work, and have confidence about what is right.  

Many SJMC students felt Freedman's advice was extremely influential to their career. 

"The lecture reinforced the [Mass Communications Law & Ethics] book and provided information that students need to know about the field of journalism," said Jason Gellar, a senior and student within SJMC. 

During his lecture, Freedman educated students on their rights to information as journalists and as public citizens. 

According to Freedman, the public has a right to know what its government is doing and access to information should not be withheld from the media. 

Freedman also said journalists should not be afraid to start their career with the smaller stories-the stories in smaller communities that affect real people who do not get as much national attention. 

"Our highest purpose is not the headliner or the politically motivated story. But instead, what we do locally. Every wrong we right, that is our purpose," Freedman said. 

Freedman was also a guest speaker in two classes that same day. In associate professor Neil Reisner's Introduction to Journalism class and in visiting associate

Headline: Annual fair brings parking problems
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Senior Brenden McCune, who is studying theater, gets to school at around 11 a.m. He works on designing projects with the theatre department until 1 p.m. and then he's off to his first class at 2 p.m.

And for the most part, he likes to stick to his schedule.

Come March, however, McCune changes his routine and readies himself for anything that may offset his schedule. 

"I've come to the realization that come the beginning of March, I have to rethink my routine," McCune said.

And that's because it's that time of year again - the annual Miami-Dade County Youth Fair is in town and adding to FIU's already tight parking problem.

From March 5 until April 8, students will not be permitted to park in Lot 5 located next to the Wertheim Performing Arts Center. The lot will be exclusively used for fair parking.

But McCune isn't letting the fair faze him.

"It's just something I've had to get used to," he said.

According to Bill Foster, director of Parking and Traffic, half of the lot sits on Miami-Dade County owned property, while the other half sits on FIU property.

FIU has exclusive use of the lot for 11 months out of the year, while the Youth Fair has it for the remaining month - March - when it comes to town.

With the fair scheduled to open March 15, Foster expects it to be a busier opening day since entrance to the fair will only be $1.

"The Fair's schedule, except for [March 15 and 16], is during Spring Break and there is a method to that. It doesn't really affect our class schedule much for a week and a couple of days," Foster said.

With the added traffic during the opening weekend of the fair, Foster said that Public Safety officers will be stationed at Panther Hall and Lot 6, which is for students in housing only, in order to keep fairgoers from taking up the already limited amount of spaces for housing students.

"We staff it during the peak times of the fair [3 p.m. to 11 p.m.] to make sure that fair people stay out and housing people stay in," Foster said.

Kristina Bingham, a senior majoring in advertising who has lived on campus for four years, has dealt with the parking frustrations that arise when the fair arrives.

"In the evening when the fair is going on, there are a lot of police and some of the exits and entrances from the campus are closed and it's just a hassle to get to our parking when you want to get home," Bingham said.

On one occasion, she wasn't able to find parking in Lot 6 and said she had to go park by the Recreation Center and walk to Everglades Hall. That's one option for Bingham. Her other option can be costly.

 "If I'm really lazy, I'll just get a ticket and just park right in front," she said.

Bingham and other students feel that parking may be a bit worse this year, especially for students who live on campus, since the Lakeview residence hall was recently added.

Although the fair may create stress for those trying to find parking at University Park, Foster said there are plenty of parking spaces on campus to compensate for the month-long loss of spaces in Lot 5.

"There are spaces available on this campus that are not very convenient and they can use the Panther Garage. It's got 800 empty parking spaces," Foster said. "That's a really great place for them to go, but most people don't look at it as a great place to go. It is a little bit more of a walk."

Students can also park in Lot 7 next to the FIU Football Stadium, which has 200 additional parking spaces. 

Aside from parking further from the intended destination, students and faculty are encouraged to get to UP a little earlier. 

"It makes you rethink your scheduling. You have to consider how long it will take you to find parking," McCune said. "I have kind of gotten used to it by now because it's my fourth year here. It's kind of become a routine. I'm like 'okay, it's March, get ready to lose parking [spaces] and reschedule some things,' but it's still a hamper."

Headline: Off-campus center serves as 'home' for Jewish students
Author: Kelly Poveromo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Jewish students and staff at FIU now have a home they can call their own. At the new Chabad home, Jewish students are welcomed to pray and study their books and religious traditions.

Jewish students and families gathered March 11 to watch Rabbi Levi Friedman, director of the Chabad Jewish Student Center, as he led the dedication of the new student center. Located just half a mile from University Park, the Chabad Center is now officially open to the FIU community.

"The goal [of a Chabad house] is to provide an environment where students feel comfortable," Friedman said. "[There are] so many stereotypes about Judaism and here, we like to break down the barriers and eliminate those labels. Everyone has the same right to their heritage and we provide a non-judgmental environment."

The Chabad Center is officially known as the "Tabacinic Chabad   House," in commemoration of philanthropist Moshe Tabacinic, who donated funds to Chabad of FIU to help with construction of the new center. FIU students were often seen at University of Miami, participating in its Chabad activities. After learning of FIU students' wishes of a Chabad house to call their own, Tabacinic approached his own rabbi in Bal Harbour, combined efforts and created the home for FIU.

Generally, rabbis involved in a Chabad center aid their local community providing schools, synagogues and other social services. However, since the Tabacinic Center is student oriented, different activities are provided such as Chabad dinners, classes and hands on activities that bring the Judaism religion and culture alive.

"A couple of weeks ago, we had a big weekend in Gainesville where we were joined by 10 different universities with Chabad centers," Friedman said.

During this visit, FIU Jewish students were able to interact with other Jewish students from universities including Florida State University, Emory and UM.

Chabad is known as one of the largest Jewish outreach centers in the world with approximately 3,000 centers total. The Chabad Center is a project costing approximately $700,000. Chabad centers at universities usually cater to the students' needs.

"I think the dedication is an amazing opportunity. It allows students to get together in a traditional fashion. On most college campuses, there is a Chabad house and now, FIU can join and be a part of thousands of other colleges, too," said Nina Dardashti, one of many students at the dedication ceremony.

The Tabacinic Center's dedication ceremony began with the completion of the Torah Scroll, the handwritten first five books of the Hebrew Bible-considered the holiest item in the Jewish faith.

After announcing their Hebrew name, each rabbi then signed the scroll.

Soon after, Friedman helped to unveil a plaque on the wall stating the name and dedication date of the Tabacinic Chabad House. Among those present at the dedication ceremony were Chief Rabbi of Israel Yona Metzger, Rabbi Sholom Lipskier and FIU President Modesto A. Maidique. 

As stated in a University press release, roughly 3,000 Jewish students at FIU will be able to participate in this program.

"We hope to see exponential growth in student participation and perhaps a larger facility to make it that much easier for the students," Friedman said. "We're here, come out and visit. Stop by and you're guaranteed to come back again." 

The Tabacinic Chabad Center is located at 10031 S.W. 15th Terrace.

Any students interested in the Tabacinic Chabad house may visit the website www.ChabadFIU.com or contact the organization via e-mail: Rabbi@ChabadFIU.com.

Family, friends of deceased Cuban student donate $50,000 for new scholarship 

The family and friends of slain Cuban student leader Jose Antonio Echeverria is donating $50,000 to establish the Jose Antonio Echeverria Scholarship fund at FIU. 

The donation marks the 50th anniversary of an attempt by Echeverria and other students at the University of Havana in the late 1950s to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. However, the attack failed, and Echeverria was killed by the police. 

The Jose Antonio Echeverria Scholarship will award $2,000 each academic year to cover tuition and books.Although Echeverria was an architecture student, the scholarship will be awarded through the department of political science to encourage students to become active in governmental and political affairs.

Headline: Baseball squeezes past Rutgers for series win
Author: Roberto Cartagena / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers (12-7) took two out of three games from the Scarlet Knights (6-6) March 9-11 at University Park Stadium.

Overall, the Golden Panthers took control of the series behind strong starting pitching and timely hitting.

"We wanted to be tested headed into conference play and we were," coach Danny Price said.



Rutgers 12, FIU 5



Junior starting pitcher Jorge Ramos threw a season high 130 pitches, giving up seven runs - five of which were earned - in six innings. However, he did not get much help defensively.

Twice the Golden Panthers committed errors that kept Rutgers alive in the inning. The first error came in the fifth inning, when senior third baseman Bryan Pullin overthrew junior first baseman John Petika. Rutgers' Tim Querns ended up scoring all the way from first on the play.

The next inning, freshman shortstop Manuel Arrojo had a ball drop from his glove that allowed Todd Frazier to reach first. Frazier proceeded to steal second and was brought home on an RBI single by Michael Bionde.

The Golden Panthers scored a run in each of the first two innings, two runs in the fifth and a run in the seventh, which cut the lead 7-5.

It looked like the Golden Panthers were on their way to a comeback, but the momentum quickly died once the eighth inning came along.

FIU's Chris Siebenaler walked the first batter he faced, and gave up a hit to the next. The third batter of the inning, Ryan Hill, broke the game open with his second homer of the night.

The Golden Panthers scored five fewer runs than their season average, but Price said he was not concerned about his team's offensive production.

"If we stay away from errors, we'll win some ball games," he said. "Our offense is going to be there."



FIU 4, Rutgers 2



In the second game of the series, the Golden Panthers found themselves in an unlikely pitchers' duel with the Scarlet Knights.

Junior pitcher Chris Allen was supposed to start game three of the series for the Golden Panthers. Instead, he was moved up a game after freshman pitcher Corey Polizzano twisted his ankle. 

Allen ended up pitching a complete game and struck out 12 Rutgers batters.

Even with Allen's performance, the Golden Panthers still found themselves down 1-0 in the bottom of the seventh. The Golden Panthers hurt their own cause by getting out many times from swinging at first pitches.

Rutgers starting pitcher Steve Healing only threw 71 pitches through 6 2/3 innings.

The Golden Panthers finally got to Healing in the sixth inning and tied the game on a home run by Petika.

"All that was going through my mind was that we got to get Chris some rest, so I definitely wasn't going to swing at the first pitch," Petika said.

Pullin followed the home run with a single and was brought home by senior catcher Cody Jacobs's double.

At this point, Rutgers pulled their starter and brought in reliever Sean Spicer. The Golden Panthers countered by bringing in a pinch hitter, junior Raimy Fuentes, who took Spicer deep for his first homer of the year. It was the Golden Panthers' third pinch-hit homer this season. 

The complete game was the first for the Golden Panthers since senior pitcher Walker Whitley threw one on April 21 last year. It was also the first time a Golden Panthers pitcher had double-digit strike outs since Feb. 18 of last season - Whitley was the last pitcher to do that as well.

"I went in there knowing I had to be the stopper for the team and I'm glad we got the win," Allen said.

Coach Price's confidence in Allen made him realize that his starter was going to finish the game no matter the circumstances.

"There was no way, we were going to be able to take the ball away from Chris. After the seventh inning I told him this game is yours to win," Price said.



FIU 7, Rutgers 6



It was a back and forth game for much of the game, with the Golden Panthers striking first. Freshman designated hitter Tyler Townsend and senior catcher Luis Bautista hit back-to-back, two-out home runs in the first inning to give FIU a 2-0 lead.

Rutgers came back with two runs of their own in the fourth. Querns singled in Frazier and Hill to even the score. The Golden Panthers took the lead again in the bottom of the inning on an RBI single by Petika, who ended up going 4-for-6 in the game and extending his hitting streak to 17 games. 

Rutgers came back in the sixth inning with two runs, including a Dave Williams homer, which gave Rutgers their first lead of the game.

The lead was short lived, as the Golden Panthers countered with two runs of their own in the seventh inning. Each team would score one run a piece in the eighth inning. 

In the ninth, the Golden Panthers brought in freshman pitcher Ryan Bernal for Whitley, who was making his second start of the season. Whitley pitched eight innings, allowing five runs on eight hits, while striking out five batters.

Bernal gave up a game tying RBI double to Frazier, which send the game into extra innings. Bernal came back in the tenth and retired Rutgers in order.

Pinch-hitting in the bottom of the 10th, Fuentes hit a one-out single to right field. Chris Dunn was brought in to pinch run for Fuentes and freshman outfielder Brian Adams followed with another single. Junior James McOwen came up to plate and hit a single of his own, advancing the runners.  

Price, with the bases loaded, decided to try the squeeze play with Corey Lozano at the plate, which proved successful.

"I got a little bit of a late jump. The catcher was out two feet from the plate and I managed to slide in there," Dunn said.

Headline: Softball loses conference home series
Author: Andrew C. Julian / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In its first conference series of the season, the FIU softball team lost two of three games to the Hilltoppers of Western Kentucky. The two squads split the March 10 doubleheader at University Park Stadium, with WKU winning the first game 9-0 in five innings and the Golden Panthers winning the nightcap 5-3. 

The Hilltoppers took the March 11 matinee 9-2, as WKU sophomore starting pitcher Jennifer Kempf allowed only eight hits and one earned run while striking out five batters in 12 innings of work in the series.

"She was very, very good, and she kept us off balance," coach Kim Gwydir said. "Hopefully we can get on a winning streak over the next week, before getting back into conference play."

The Golden Panthers (9-17, 1-2) resume conference play on March 24 against Troy at home, after a home date with Rutgers and road contests against South Florida and the University of Florida.



WKU 9, FIU 0



The Golden Panthers, who came into the game winning eight out of their past 11 games, only managed four hits and stranded all six base runners as Kempf turned in her best outing of the year -- recording her first complete game shutout of the season. 

Junior pitcher Kerri Houck started for the Golden Panthers, but came out on the losing end even though she only surrendered one earned run.

The Hilltoppers scored five unearned runs in the second inning off of two FIU errors.



FIU 5, WKU 3



Sophomore pitcher Penny Eastman improved her record to 6-6 on the season in the second game of the double-header. The Golden Panthers earned their first conference win of the season as Eastman pitched a complete game, striking out eight and allowing two earned runs.

Junior outfielder Ashley Falk led the way offensively for the Golden Panthers, going 3-for-3 with three RBI. Senior catcher Kim Rodriguez went 2-for-3 with two RBI and scored two runs. 



WKU 9, FIU 2



The Golden Panthers ran into Kempf yet again and she was still on target from the previous meeting.

Eastman and the rest of her teammates could not keep up offensively as the Hilltoppers took the final game of the series. The Hilltoppers took an early 7-0 lead into the bottom of the third inning before the Golden Panthers could answer back. 

Tabitha Embry and Desiree Fink each drove in a run for FIU in the loss.

Headline: Editorial: Annual fair does not aid University's growing pains
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It's that time of the year again: the Dade County Youth Fair is setting up camp at the Fair Expo Center, right next door to FIU.

This means students can look forward to corn dogs, elephant ears and even more congested parking lots through March and early April. Although the fair doesn't open until March 15, students are prohibited from parking in Lot 5, next to the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, from March 5 to April 8.

Students who have been at FIU during this month are used to bracing themselves when fair seasons comes around. Parking at University Park is scarce enough throughout the year, but during March it becomes just plain chaotic. This situation prompts a logical question: Why does FIU have to share its parking space with fairgoers?

After all, we are here the whole year 'round, and our business here - studying - is more legitimate than, say, eating funnel cakes. Why should we have to disrupt our routine to accommodate the fair? To us, that question is valid, but the real significance of this situation is that it brings to light a more serious, pervasive and long-term problem: that FIU is outgrowing the University Park campus.

For the amount of students it accommodates, UP is already cramped quarters. FIU is also expecting to receive more than 1,500 new students next year. At this pace, FIU's main campus will soon be bursting at the seams.

The squeeze is that the campus' setting is urban; it is surrounded by residential and business properties. It's quartered off from all directions, which means that it doesn't really have anywhere to grow. Unless…

Yes, there is an "unless," a "but," an escape clause for this pressing situation. On a few occasions, FIU President Modesto A. Maidique has mentioned the possibility of taking over the fairgrounds.We can't take over all of them - a portion, including community areas, swimming pools and sports fields are city-owned public parks, and therefore off limits. But we could legally, and plausibly, take over the empty fields where the fair is held.

The process by which FIU could do this is unclear. For one thing, it would probably have to buy the land from the city. It would probably also have to get its hands dirty with a lot of local politics.

In the end, it's a matter of who could put that public land to better use. The Dade County Youth Fair uses that land for one month a year. The University would use it every day, year-round. The fair's purpose - entertainment - is important to the city's public life. But laudable as that objective is, it doesn't trump that of an institution of higher education, shaping the minds that will shape South Florida's future. 

As for The Beacon, although we can't speak to the process by which FIU acquires that land, we would wholeheartedly support the decision to acquire it if it's ever considered.

Headline: Coke wrongfully accused
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Lately I've been hearing a lot of people attacking the Coca-Cola Company and its business practices in Colombia. I am sick of it.

The "Killer Coke" campaign led by the United Students Against Sweatshops is the source of the negativity aimed at Coca-Cola. Currently, the USAS have convinced the Student Government Association to support them in their endeavor to rid FIU of Coca-Cola products and replace them with the only other real competitor, Pepsi.

While I believe USAS has every right to believe in what they want to believe, they do not have the right to force their extreme views on the rest of the student body.

USAS claims that Coca-Cola has been supporting paramilitary groups responsible for killing labor union leaders in Colombia and pressuring  union members to sign letters of resignation with Coca-Cola letterheads -31 percent of Coca-Cola's Colombian workers are unionized.

This stance has been the USAS' main point against Coca-Cola since the "Killer Coke" campaign began. 

But as stated in a previous Beacon article, those claims were thrown out of the Colombian court system for lack of evidence.

"Two different judicial inquiries in Colombia - one in a Colombian Court and one by the Colombian Attorney General - found no evidence to support the allegations that bottler management conspired to intimidate trade unionists," said  a document cited in that article.

The Cal Safety Compliance Corporation - a renowned global and impartial leader in conducting corporate social accountability audits - found no evidence to support the allegations against Coca-Cola. 

Yet despite these facts, USAS continues, trying to effectively ban Coca-Cola from campus. One thing the USAS should really take into consideration is the state Colombia is actually in at the moment.

The country is in the middle of a civil war. There are various political groups killing each other and innocent civilians in alarming numbers. Just because a few Coca- Cola workers have been among the unlucky victims does not mean that the Coca-Cola Corporation has something to do with it. Rather than blaming a soda manufacturer, perhaps the USAS should look more at the armed groups who might actually be responsible.

Whatever happened to the freedom to choose what beverage you want to drink?

Oh, and that "Don't Drink Coke Day" March 14 was an utter waste of time. Trying to prove Coca-Cola is a bloodthirsty corporation by giving away samples of its competitors does not make sense.

Now if USAS was trying to prove their samples tasted better than Coca-Cola, they would've  been onto something. But that, apparently, was not their goal. I wish they had spent that precious oxygen complaining about things that actually mattered - say, protesting the war in Iraq or bunny experimentations.

If the USAS succeeds in effectively banning Coca-Cola from FIU,  then they will be responsible for taking away the freedom of choice that we as consumers deserve. 

When Coca-Cola was made the official campus beverage, it was because they were cheaper than Pepsi and had more to offer. FIU shouldn't disregard that fact simply because a small group of students have decided to launch a crusade against what they deem a homicidal soda company.

"Killer" Coca-Cola has not been found legally responsible for the death of a single Colombian worker. However, the way this group is handling the situation, you'd think Coke has also been in charge of  kidnapping the Lindbergh baby, assassinating John F. Kennedy and Tupac Shakur. If you want to talk conspiracy theory, I'd bet that these "Pepsi Youth" were under that company's payroll.

Hopefully, when it comes time for the big decision about whether or not to renew the Coca-Cola contract, FIU will make the right choice by choosing the company that can best serve the students at FIU, not the company that a bunch of radicals claim is bad.

Headline: Trivial Pursuit...a pop culture column: Gritty graphic novel characters find home in Hollywood scripts
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Much has been said about 300, the violent, action epic on Sparta currently tearing up the box office. In fact, The Beacon has already written two stories about the film. Much of its praise has been for its groundbreaking visual style. But not everyone knows that the film is virtually a shot-by-shot remake of its source material by legendary comic book auteur Frank Miller, whose work was also the inspiration for Sin City.

The name Frank Miller may not be too familiar to those outside the comic book world but to those immersed in this sub-culture, he's often looked upon as one of the most influential and popular comic book creators ever. Along with the equally influential Alan Moore, Miller is credited for establishing the popularity and appeal of the graphic novel in the minds of the general public. This brings me to the topic of my column this week - the graphic novel and its ever growing popularity in Hollywood.

For many people, graphic novels may be seen as just another series of comic books on the level of other popular works in the genre such as Superman, Spiderman or Batman. But other than the medium in which the work is presented, the graphic novel can hardly be compared to regular comics.  Unlike comics, which have ongoing stories and characters, graphic novels are more in line with regular novels, that is, they have a beginning, middle and an end. In short, graphic novels are more like short story collections, science fiction or noir novels. The themes tackled in graphic novels are usually complex and intended for mature audiences as opposed to regular comic books, creating an obvious allure to Hollywood studios.

Although the superhero market has always been a commodity in movie history, Tim Burton's 1989 adaptation of Batman is widely regarded to have been influenced by Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns - a very momentous graphic novel, as well as Moore's Batman: The Killing Joke. Batman Begins, the latest film in the series, was also heavily influenced by Miller's works. Even many critically-acclaimed films such as Road to Perdition, A History of Violence, Ghost World, American Splendor and more recently V for Vendetta - along with the aforementioned Sin City and 300 - have had their source material rooted in graphic novels.

However, with Hollywood influence comes consequences. Although there have been successful adaptations that have pleased the creators, many of the adaptations have become massive disappointments with most replacing style and action with substance and depth. While the adaptation of Miller's works have been relatively well-received, adaptations of Moore's works have been mixed, including disappointments such as From Hell and Constantine, to the outright catastrophe that was The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Moore has been quite vocal about his dissatisfaction with the film adaptations and has disowned every adaptation of his works, including V for Vendetta and the highly anticipated adaptation of his groundbreaking novel Watchmen.

This work, which is set in an alternate world where superheroes live alongside civilians, has been spoofed and been referenced to in both film and television, ranging from "The Simpsons" to Pixar's The Incredibles, which was very loosely based on the novel. It is widely considered one of the greatest works in graphic novel/comic book history and the only graphic novel to be named on Time magazine's "100 Greatest English Language Novels of the 20th Century."

Zach Snyder, the director of 300, will be directing the film version of the novel and is expecting release in late 2008 or early 2009. With the success of 300, the upcoming sequels to Sin City and possible adaptations of other graphic novels such as Ronin, an end to Hollywood's love affair with the graphic novel seems far away.

Headline: ADVENTURES ACROSS AMERICA: Spring Break offers opportunities for much-needed sightseeing
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Between cramming for midterms and writing 10-page papers, many students may not have had time to explore the best ways to enjoy their upcoming reprieve from their academic pursuit, otherwise known as Spring Break. Despite travel agencies and websites' best efforts to boast packages that offer the same old fun-in-the-sun cliché, your college brain may need something a little more creative, bold or that at least avoids South Beach's unwritten "10-20-Life" law, which is what you pay for drinks, parking and how long you're in traffic, respectively.

Just like having a thesis for your paper, having a theme to your vacation may be the best way to organize your ideas and create a mini-adventure worthy of avoiding the four books and two projects you have to finish, if at least for a few days.



The Big City Blowout



There comes a certain age where you're almost expected to have seen certain key points of interest. The look of puzzled disgust that precedes the phrase "You've never been to … ?" gets old pretty quickly. So, if you missed your 5th grade trip to Washington, D.C., on account of the measles, this trip is for you. 

The Plan: The best way to see America is by car (driving up the east coast ensures at least four major cities en route), but if time and money are constraints - it takes roughly 10 hours to drive Florida alone - a good solution is to choose lengthy layovers in cities that allow you to break out of the airport and see the sights for a bit.

Can't miss: Statue of Liberty, New York City, N.Y.; White House, Washington, D.C.; Walk of Fame, Hollywood, Ca.; Sears Tower, Chicago, Ill.



The MTV-Generation Supreme Spring Break Bash



Thanks to the genius of Pauly Shore and marketing executives clamoring for your dollar, Spring Break is now synonymous with beach, bikini and beer buzz. If that's what you're into, then you're in exactly the right place. According to the Travel Channel, Florida boasts three of the top 10 Spring Break locales, which means expect a surge of pale Midwesterners.

The Plan: Head north. Start your path to bronze skin (and golden brown livers) at Key West. Then, make sure to hit South Beach, Daytona Beach and finally Panama City - the top-rated 2007 Spring Break destination among many travel critics. ­Thanks to our location, following the masses has never been so easy and gas-money friendly.

Can't miss: Countless of opportunities to see production teams from either MTV or Girls Gone Wild.



The History Buff Tour



There's nothing wrong with wanting to continue your education. Learning can be fun, too! If you want to have some fun and to take in some information as well, hit some museums. It doesn't have to be all wars and paintings. Many cities offer science, technology, sports and entertainment museums, many with interactive experiences.

The Plan: You won't find small, specialized museums in every travel guide, so try to Google your specific passion and quaint places will pop up everywhere.

Can't miss: Alcatraz Island, San Francisco, Ca.; Newseum (a personal favorite), Washington D.C; Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Cleveland, Ohio; Museum of Television and Radio, New York City, N.Y. or Los Angeles, Ca.



The Spooky City Survey



There's nothing cooler than going on a ghost chase or alien hunt. By traveling to so-called haunted destinations you get to do the grown-up version of camping out in the abandoned house at the end of the block. Fright is a known aphrodisiac, so get on a tram and cuddle up and prepare to go bump in the night. 

The Plan: The Northeast is all about a creepy, aloof atmosphere with its overcast skies and large wooded areas. Philadelphia alone has a bevy of scary spots, which include the house where Lizzie Borden gave her parents what was coming to them. However, don't neglect the Southwest with its alien crash sites - you'll "phone home" with news of possible sightings. 

Miami has its own number of haunts, which include a Ramada Inn that at one point was Al Capone's lair and Coral Castle, the tribute to lost love by weirdie Ed Leedskalnin. 

Can't miss:  Roswell Crash Site, Roswell, N.M.; St. Valentine's Day Massacre Site, Chicago, Ill.; New Orleans, La.



The Roller Coaster Rampage 



If thrills are what you're into, another aphrodisiac, then Florida again is a great launching point for a roller coaster tour to be remembered - and hopefully not all over your car's carpets. The benefit of being young is you still have a stomach that can handle it, so you might as well take advantage.

The Plan: If Florida theme parks are a bore, as many take advantage of Florida resident rates and annual passes, you can go for the best. The "Millenium Force" in Sandusky, Ohio, is the tallest coaster at 310 feet and reaches speeds of 92 mph. St. Louis, Mo., offers a wooden roller coaster named "The Boss" which has over 5,000 feet of track.

Can't miss: Still a favorite among Miamians, "The Incredible Hulk" roller coaster at Islands of Adventure, Orlando, Fla.

Headline: SG councils dispute election date changes
Author: Jessica Solis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While the Student Government Association as a whole agreed upon changing their election dates, the two councils at University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus could not come to an agreement as to how the date change, which was unconstitutional, should be implemented.

At a University-Wide Council meeting last semester, Charlie Andrews, director of Campus Life at UP, requested the elections be postponed so members of that organization could attend a conference in Orlando that would be taking place during the original election dates of April 4 and April 5.

Campus Life is responsible for supervising the election polls.

In order to accommodate the request, representatives from both councils agreed to move the election date by one week, although their  constitution states that annual elections "will be held for two (2) days of the second week following Spring Break." 

The request changes the election dates to April 10 and April 11.

The University-Wide Council is made up of the presidents, vice presidents, speakers of the houses and finance comptrollers from both campuses.

"It was never an option," said Providence Okoye, vice president of SGC-UP. "It was either change the date, or no elections."

While both branches of SGC agreed the dates should be changed, disagreements arose about how to change them. Since the constitution states a specific time for elections, changing the dates without formally amending the constitution would be a violation.

Some, however, were hesitant about not following the rules.

"I didn't want to change the date with a violation of the constitution," said Gabriel Labrador, SGC-BBC representative-at-large.

Andrews saw the concern some of the SGC-BBC officers had.

"I don't think the students at BBC were ever as comfortable as the students at UP with the concept that we were violating the constitution," he said. "But they were willing to accommodate the request in an effort to try and help the administrators with this conflict we were facing."

Labrador and other SGC-BBC officers who were part of the University-Wide Council then recommended holding special elections in January to amend the constitution. However, the special elections never happened, but the dates were still changed.

"Among [Labrador], myself, Camilo Silva [SGC-BBC president], and Brent Maximin [SGC-BBC vice president], we were not pleased, but we kind of knew it was going to happen," said Zachary Trautenberg, SGC-BBC comptroller.

According to Trautenberg, communication was the problem that hindered the chance for a special election.

"I think there was a lack of collaboration," Trautenberg said. "We lost our elections commissioner, which did hurt us, but it shouldn't have stopped us."

Concerns about voter turnout were also one of the reasons some SGC-BBC officers were hesitant to change the election date.

"If we push the elections a week after, students will be very busy due to finals and exams," Silva told Andrews in a November 2006 e-mail. The e-mail, originally sent to Andrews by Silva, was forwarded to The Beacon.

Trautenberg said the date change could be an advantage or a disadvantage for students on both campuses, depending on how it's looked at.

"The closer you get to finals, the more people are studying, so there might be less [students at the polls], but to look on the other side, more students might be on campus studying," Trautenberg said. "You really can't judge it until you see it happen."

Others see benefits behind the change.

"I don't think that it should have a negative effect at all because it's still two weeks before finals," said Craig Cunningham, director of Campus Life at BBC. "Personally, I think it will give candidates extra time to campaign."

To avoid future complications and misunderstandings, both branches of SGC proposed to change the constitution at the same University-Wide Council meeting in order to avoid future problems. On this year's election ballot, students will have the opportunity to vote on a proposed amendment that would allow for legal date changes. This new constitution would go into effect immediately after University President Modesto A. Maidique or a representative approves it.

In the March 1 issue of The Beacon, Kathryn Cubbon, a member of SGC-UP's judicial board, stated that students also do not care about when elections are held. Trautenberg agreed with Cubbon.

"I hate to agree with this, but I do think that students are sort of apathetic," Trautenberg said. "But I think it's wrong of SGA to plan things and do things with that notion. Our job is to encourage students, not to be apathetic."

Okoye said the violations were made to provide students with the opportunity to vote at some point rather than not vote at all.

"We don't have ulterior motives," Okoye said. "We're not changing our elections date because we want a specific person to win. It's not personal."

SGC-BBC is currently planning an information forum to let students know about the new election dates.

"I strongly feel that this was a learning experience for all of us to recognize, analyze and never do it again," Silva said.
