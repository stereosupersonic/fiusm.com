Headline: Student government welcomes UP students
Author: Adriana Oliva / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This year FIU will be celebrating a new football team and the College of Law. To kickoff the new school year and the new programs FIU has to offer, the Student Government Council has put together Welcome Week.

Today, August 28, two events will take place. First, SGC will host a convocation for freshmen. 

 "For this convocation, SGA will be giving away t-shirts as well as other giveaways," "Kickoff '02" Chair Griselle Diaz said. 

Also taking place today is "Ask Me Day." There will be more giveaways and "Get involved" shirts will be distributed. 

"We are going to basically be there to let students know which building is which, where they can find advising or financial [services], and things like that," Diaz said.

Thursday is "Kickoff '02." Events start at 11 a.m. and proceed until 5 p.m. A free barbecue will be provided from 11-2 p.m. and from 3:30-5 p.m. at the fountain by GC. Tents with tables will be located by PC so students can sit and eat. 

Entertainment events will be going on all day from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 

In order to attend the barbecue, students must have a valid student ID. When the ID is presented, the student will be given a wristband, which must be  kept on to get food and to participate in a raffle. 

Raffle tickets will be given at the football game, which starts at 7:30 p.m.

 "We are raffling away gift certificates to the bookstore," Diaz said. 

Gift certificates are in amounts of $50, $150, and $250. The raffle will take place in the first quarter. 

 "I think this is going to be a great welcome week, just because there are so many new things that FIU has to offer," engineering major Jay Cueco said.

After the barbecue, Panther Rage will take over from 5 to 6:30 p.m.. 

The last welcome week event takes place September 27. "Level 5," which is the name of the event, will take place on the fifth floor of the Gold Parking Garage. There will be free food and music. Surprise DJs will be spinning at the turntables. 

 "[Since] last year we only did half of the fifth floor, this year we want to expand and use the entire fifth floor," Diaz said.

Student government expects 1,500 people attend the barbecue.

Headline: Renovation brings campus life downstairs
Author: Marcela Levy / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Renovations have recently begun in the Wolfe University Center at the Biscayne Bay Campus in an effort to relocate the offices of campus life. Plans are also in the works for a new cafeteria and fitness center.  

 "Biscayne Bay has moved into a new upbeat phase where things are happening everyday," BBC's Student Government Vice-President Alexander Lewy said, "There are a bunch of projects coming up to re-vamp the Bay campus." 

WUC  Director Bill Williamson said the new cafeteria and gym are expected to cost $3.7 million. Campus Life office figures were unavailable.

The campus life offices will be moved from the third floor of WUC to the first floor where the game room once operated. 

BBC Student Affairs Vice President Dr. Brian Haynes said the relocation will provide students with better access to the offices that are more student-oriented.  It is also an effort in "promoting student activities and development," he said. 

Despite the attempt to assist students by relocating the offices, some students had concerns about the future of the game room. 

There was a petition going around to keep the game room open, which senior Zukina Contreras signed.

"It was a great way to relieve stress between finals," Contreras said.

Campuses across the country are closing their game rooms and campus life is more important, Haynes said.

Apart from attracting very few people, the game room was not making enough money to stay in operation, Lewy said.

 Haynes added that the billiard table and various arcade games will be spread throughout the campus for the amusement of the students.

In addition to the new offices of campus life, BBC's standards are being upgraded.

A 302-seat food court is in the works as well as a new 10,000 sq. ft. fitness center. The food court, which is now located on the second floor will be relocated by the telecommunications and disability services offices on the first floor, Williamson said. The new food court will extend the WUC and will have glass windows facing the pond behind the WUC and the ballroom. There is no consensus about what will replace the current food court, but Williamson said they might place new classrooms there.

The fitness center, which is currently on the third floor, will be moved to the first floor around the pool area. This way all the athletic facilities will be in the same area, Williamson said. The current space of the fitness center will most probably become meeting rooms.  

Many students have concerns about the funding going into these projects.

 "Maybe they should use the money to hire more advisors, especially for the business department," Senior Rene Garcia said.  

Sophomore Shimena Sims seems to agree.

"I think they need to stop focusing on the cosmetic and start looking at the academic," Sims said, "we need more classes at Biscayne Bay, not another food court."

But, Williamson said what they are spending is a small amount compared to what other universities spend on their renovations.

Many other students are showing enthusiasm toward the future changes. 

"Sounds extremely great," junior Vicky Morales said.

"I think that it is great that the school is planning on making renovations, it is long overdue," junior Leslie Russo said.

Junior Aileen Averbuch agrees, "It's about time we get some activities by the bay; I will definitely be spending more time on campus than usual."

  Haynes also said there are some plans for renovations of the Academic One building, but those are still under discussion.

The new campus life offices should be ready in October. All other projects are expected to be completed by the beginning of 2004.

Headline: New restaurant creates social atmosphere
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This fall, FIU will implement a brand new dining program in conjunction with Aramark, a dining services company contracted to operate FIU food services.

FIU's Dining Services Marketing Manager Manuel Rivera is excited about the new dining options available to students, noting that "It'll be new for everyone, not just the freshmen."

 "The new dining services are a joint effort between the department of dining services, business and finance, and student affairs," Business Services Assistant Director Felicia Townsend said. Thanks to the new seats and atmosphere, "eating will be a more social event."

The new dining area, which both Rivera and Aramark's National Brand Manager Ted McDaniel insist on calling a restaurant not a cafeteria, will have a makeshift entrance for about a year due to construction of the permanent entrance. 

At the first of five restaurants, Island Cuisine, a typical meal might include Trinidad chicken, jicama salad and flan.

"Because it's being prepared in front of students' eyes, there's no mystery," McDaniel said. 

Immediately following the Island Cuisine is a restaurant known as the American Kitchen. Here students will find regional comfort food such as rotisserie chicken, fresh garlic mashed potatoes and southern green beans.

The Mediterranean Kitchen has accommodations for people with more exotic tastes. Among the dishes that might be served here are eggplant parmesan casserole or lasagna for dinner, followed by tiramisu for dessert. 

The American Bistro will serve soups, wraps and sandwiches such as the grilled chicken caesar sandwich. 

A salad bar will feature a wide variety of vegetables and fruits.

If he has a meal plan, a student must simply swipe their Panther card and proceed to the wide variety of foods available to him. 

If a student chooses not to get a meal plan, they would pay $4.95 for breakfast, $5.95 for lunch or $6.50 for dinner and then proceed to the food section. 

Every meal eaten in the new restaurant is all-you-can-eat, with or without a meal plan.

 "Students can opt not to enroll in a meal plan," explained Jim Wasanar, director of housing and finance. "If they do, though, they'll get nice, convenient food service at a good price," he said.

Weekly menus will be available online at www.pantherdining.com. On this website you can also send a fellow Panther a gift basket containing snacks, candy and other goodies for events such as a birthday, Halloween, or "just because." 

The new eating area will stay open until 9 p.m., an hour later than it stayed open last year. It will also be open on the weekends. In the past, this happened only sporadically.

Thanks to the expansion in square footage, dining services will be able to serve up to 1,500 people, an increase of 350 people. 

To accommodate this expansion, the building will simply grow in a northern and western direction, bringing the building significantly closer to the Green Library.

FIU is the eighth American University to implement this program. Schools including the University of Florida, MIT, Clemson, Mercer and Eastern Kentucky University have had it for years.

"It's a real paradigm shift, so the employees will have to learn," said McDaniel.

In order to get employees ready this summer, 16 FIU employees were taken to the University of Florida – where the program has been running for a number of years – to give them a firsthand look at how the system works.  

McDaniel predicts that the program will take about three weeks to be fully understood and utilized by FIU's students. Once it is, he says, there will be a 40 percent increase in customer satisfaction. 

As an incentive to purchase a meal plan, during the next few weeks the dining services department will have a lottery for the first two hundred students who sign up for a meal plan. Prizes include a mountain bike, CD player and television set. 

If a student doesn't have the time to go to the GC to pick up a meal, they have many alternatives.

Subway, Gracie's Grill featuring Pizza Hut, and Pollo Tropical – all located in GC – will continue to function alongside the new restaurants. So will Java City, which is located on the first floors of both GC and the Green Library. 

A new Starbucks also opened in the FIU bookstore. 

West Side Cafe located on the other side of campus in the CSC building continues to offer pastries and also maintains a Starbucks coffee. 

Finally, a convenience store located on the first floor of the University Park Towers building was opened for students living on campus. This store offers groceries, snacks, and health and beauty supplies as well as Montague's Deli and Bene Pizza. 

The Panther Pit, located in the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences, features yet another Starbucks. 

Burger King, Pan Geos and the other staples of FIU dining will move to another part of GC that faces the library.

Headline: Anesthetics program receives $1.87 million from federal, local grants
Author: Elaine Johnson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The School of Nursing received $1.87 million in federal and local grants for its Nurse Anesthetics Program. The funding will be used for the expansion of the student admissions and faculty positions.  

The federal grant of  $1.15 million came from the Division of Nursing, Health Resources and Services Administration  and  $720, 000 came from the Miami Beach Anesthesiology Association.

The grants came in an effort to empower the program named "Expansion of a Culturally Diverse Nurse Anesthetics Program," to expand its admission to 40 students in the upcoming academic year, School of Nursing Director Dr. Divina Grossman said.  

It will also increase the number of culturally diverse and competent Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNA), who can practice in areas where the quality of healthcare is inadequate due to poor economic conditions. 

The funding allowed the school to hire two more faculty members and to increase the student body from 10 to 15. The newly selected group consists of two Asians, three Hispanics, one African American and nine Caucasians.  The students were required to have a 3.61 GPA and a cumulative GRE score of 1052. 

Two hundred students applied for the program for the 2000-2001 academic year and it was accredited in January 2001. The initial plan was to admit only 10 students into the program, but MBAA wanted to increase the admission so they donated one faculty position for the next three years, Grossman said.

 Anesthetics Nursing Program Director Dr. John McDonough submitted the federal grant proposal to the HRSA.

"There is documented need in both Florida and throughout the nation for this grant to come about," he said. 

He was referring to a recent study done by Congress to identify the areas of need in nursing.

Grossman said she feels the money is beneficial to the effort in diversifying the nursing student body of FIU. 

The funding will also bring in equipment such as LCD projectors, laptops and a human patient simulator. The simulator is a full-size dummy connected to a computer monitored by a student. Another student works with the dummy, which breathes, has a heartbeat and imitates a patient, allowing the student to get practical experience without using real patients, McDonough explained.

 "We are on the cutting edge of technology," Grossman said.

Grossman is optimistic the school will produce bright, students. 

 "The students who are admitted in September are the first core host students into the program," Grossman said. 

Tony Umadhay, a native of the Philippines, will graduate from the anesthetics program in Dec. 2003. He received a bachelor's degree in Nursing from St. Tomas University in Manila, Philippines. Umadhay came to the United States in 1994 to complete his nursing education at FIU and is now the president of the Nurse Anethetics Class of 2003. 

"Health care is unique here in South Florida, because [of] its geographical location and the retirement population," he said, "and being in this program at FIU is an asset.  It's a big help to the shortage of nurse anesthetists." 

Umadhay has no immediate plans to return to his homeland.  

"Basically I want to stay in South Florida," he said "and I'm looking forward to the School of Nursing to start their Ph. D. program, because I want to do it." 

Maria Ciceron, a Puerto Rico native who moved to the United States when she was two, received her bachelor's degree in nursing and Master of Science in Nursing from FIU.  Ciceron is now working to receive another master in CRNA. 

"I want to stay in Miami and within three to five years I'll get my Ph.D." she said. "I [have] done everything else at FIU; I think I'll go back there to teach." 

Ciceron is happy FIU received the grant.

"The CRNA is so intense and demanding you must rely on financial aid," she said, "and that's why this grant is so great. It's worth the sacrifice."

Headline: College of Law holds first convocation
Author: Hatzel Vela
&nbsp;
Twenty-nine year old Brian Abramson joined more than 100 of his classmates at the first-ever Law School convocation this past Friday in the Graham Center ballrooms. 

Abramson said the event was remarkable to the point of breathtaking. 

"It's hard to put into words how amazing it is to have seen this process from its birth to this point," Abramson said. An FIU alumus, Abramson was the first applicant and first student to commit to a full-time law program. He added that he was especially moved by the recognition from some Florida political leaders.

In attendance were Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Harry Lee Anstead, State Rep. Gaston Cantens, State Rep. Johnnie Byrd, State Sen. Mario Diaz Balart and Governor Jeb Bush.

"This is a great day for Florida International University and for South Florida," Bush said. "A lot of aspiring lawyers will now be able to afford getting a legal degree at a world-class university."

Bush added that the state does not have enough judges that represent the diversity of the state. He feels the FIU and FAMU law schools will now change that. 

"There are students from South Florida who are Hispanic or African-American who can now afford to be a lawyer," Bush said. He added that the state has a challenge to open roads for more diversity.

"This is going to be an important step for Florida to prove that it can give opportunities to every one, no matter the origin or color," Bush said.

For Bush, this event marked an important day in South Florida. For FIU president Modesto Maidique, this was a historic day for FIU.

Maidique told the crowd that upon his arrival at FIU in 1986, he was asked when FIU would have a football team and a law school.

"I've been president for 16 years and I've been stumbling over the answers to those questions and now, I have an answer to both questions – next week."

College of Law Dean Leonard Strickman said the students' credentials are competitive with those of any other law school in the state. 

He said the diversity of the students exceeds that of any other law school in the nation. 

The class is approximately 44 percent Hispanic, 43 percent Anglo and 8 percent Black. 

"We had, in our first year, 772 applications for admissions to our inaugural class. We offered admissions to 170 of those applicants," Strickman said. 

However, of those admitted, 117 college of law students are expected to attend classes the first week and not all will be full-time. 

The inaugural class is made up of 67 full time and 50 part time students. Colin Clark is one of those students.

Clark, 34, will be a part-time student. He just earned his MBA from FIU.

Clark is the highest-scoring LSAT student in the class. He earned a score of 170, which ranks him in the 98th percentile nationally. 

"FIU was really the only option," Clark said. "It was the only option for being able to commute and juggle the schedule with work and school and the price, of course."

Clark, who lives with his wife and daughter, said coming to FIU is a 15-minute drive.

Clark said this is the place to be and that's he's really excited.

"We've been waiting for this for a long time. For a lot of us, myself included, without FIU's College of Law we wouldn't be here," Clark added.

But convenience and price are not the only factors, administrators say. 

"(Students should) take advantage of the high-quality faculty that Dean Strickman has assembled," Provost Mark Rosenberg said.

Headline: Trustees hike tuition
Subheadline: non-resident graduate, undergraduate students face 20 ercent increase
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
As students probably realized for the first time last week, tuition has risen, and out-of-state and international  students are the hardest hit.

During their June 17 meeting, the FIU Board of Trustees approved a 20 percent increase for both non-resident graduate and undergraduate students, a 10 percent increase for resident graduate students and a five percent increase in tuition for undergraduate in-state students. These increases were the maximum allowed by the state legislature.

"I don't think it's fair at all," University Park Student Government President Jessica Morffi said, "but that's where they had been given the right to [increase tuition]."

"I don't think it's a matter of fairness," Biscayne Bay Student Government President Adrian Carter said. "In-state students already pay taxes in the state.

"It's not right that tuition was raised that much [for non-resident students]," he said.

But Provost and Executive Vice President Mark Rosenberg said the hikes were needed to help increase the number of services to the university's students.

The tuition increase will not have an immediate impact on the number of class offerings, Rosenberg said.

A meeting is in the works for the week of Sept. 10 to inform students of how the money will be spent.

Morffi, the only student trustee, was the only one to vote against the increase and said the university should look elsewhere for additional funds.

"If your car insurance went up 20 percent in one year, you'd change car insurance."

International student Dane Fairweather gets his department to pay for all his classes but thinks other students should not be forced to pay more for classes.

"Twenty percent versus a five percent [increase]...it's still unfair," Fairweather, a graduate student  studying electrical engineering, said. "We're students also. We should also have the right to study.

"It doesn't make sense. It's discrimination."

Electrical Engineering major Haig Durant said FIU never notified the students of the increase.

"I work on campus and I found out through the university mail [Univ mail]," Durant said. "I was not notified through my student e-mail."

Increasing tuition is something Durant, a senior, finds unfair in the wake of the cutbacks the university has instituted.

"Twenty percent is a very huge amount," he said "You have to print a syllabus and you don't even get handouts in class."

Resident student reaction to the increase was mixed.

Maritza Enriquez, a junior majoring in business and international relations, said tuition is "really expensive as it is."

Cesar Pachon, who was paying for his girlfriend's classes, echoed Enriquez's sentiments.

"It's kind of steep this year," Pachon said.

Some Florida Pre-Paid College recipients are not feeling much of a pinch on their pocket books.

"It wasn't that much of an increase," sophomore Yaminah Sutton said while waiting in line to pay for classes. "Since I have Florida Pre-Paid, it really doesn't affect me."

Jason Remy, now a junior, said even though he is in the Florida Pre-Paid program, he still ends up paying more for classes than he did at Miami-Dade Community College.

"At Dade I only paid $33 after Pre-Paid," he said. "Here I'm paying $200."

But before the trustees approved of the increases, Morffi lobbied for the creation of a committee that would recommend how to spend the funds.

In preparation for the committee meeting, she sent an e-mail to students asking for suggestions on how to spend the extra funds.

"I realize that this may sound minimal but if we are able to put the increase in the right places, it may make the increase that much more bearable," Morffi wrote to students earlier in the semester.

After the trustees ratified the increases, Morffi said it was decided that $700,000 would be spent on student financial aid, another $700,000 on student computer labs and classroom equipment and $500,000 on student support services. A contingency reserve would be created with the $300,000 left over.

Morffi, Carter, UP Vice President Omar Castillo and BBC Vice President Alexander Lewy got the administrators – Vice Presidents Rosa Jones, Paul Gallagher, Patricia Telles-Irvin and Provost Mark Rosenberg – to agree to four items students had suggested.

With the added funds, the Campus Area Transit System will purchase an additional bus and will take residence students to the Publix across the street, the mall and back to UP.

BBC's housing shuttle should  be added to the CATS system.

"We also wanted it to run from campus to the corner of Biscayne Boulevard and 151st. St.," Carter said.

The funds in the contingency reserve will pay for the shuttles.

Short term loans for international students will also be made available.

"Short-term loans are beneficial because there isn't much financial aid from the United States," Durant said.

New computers will also be bought for the Graham and Wolfe University Center computer labs. The labs should be open as long as the buildings are open.

Morffi also lobbied for a line-item budget, listing exactly where and how much money was spent. Morffi said she expects the budget by the week of Sept. 10, just in time for the student meeting.

Headline: BBC plans to spark student interest
Author: Beatriz Simoes / Biscayne Bay Editor
&nbsp;
As FIU prepares for its first football game, the Biscayne Bay Campus' campus life organizations are getting its students ready for the new academic year with a lot of activities and free food during welcome week events.

Since classes start on a Wednesday, this year's welcome week will take place in three days, counting yesterday's freshman picnic.

"It is a way for students to get out of the school frame of mind and have some fun," Student Programming Council (SPC) President Robin Miller said. 

The events of the week are also aimed toward getting students involved in organizations that will be represented in booths on campus throughout the week.

The student body will get a chance to participate tomorrow in SPC's Welcome Fest, outside the Academic One building and in Panther Square. From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., students will be able to get free BBQ, and participate in activities with giveaways. 

Welcome Week Chair Marcela Velazquez said she is excited about the events and expects a good turnout. 

However, Velazquez said she is not sure if students will be as interested in signing up for clubs.

"This campus has trouble with club participation," she said, so SPC and the Student Organizations Council will be working harder this year to promote campus life. She said the councils are working very hard and on a more personal level this year, talking to students and handing out flyers to give them more information and encouragement.

Thursday will be all about football. Panther Power President Sherilyn Lukas said everything is ready to get students in the spirit for the first game. A pep rally will take place in Panther Square and there will be a variety of other activities until 3 p.m. At 3:30 p.m. the first of two buses will leave BBC – in front of the library – heading to the University Park Campus where the game will take place. The second bus will leave at 5 p.m. and both will return at 10:30 p.m. Both buses will be available to students for free, Lukas said.

"The games are free for students," she said, "so there is no reason for them not to attend if they have transportation."

Panther Power is advertising the game and the bus services through flyers around campus – particularly in the Bay Vista Housing apartments – and announcements during all welcome week events.

Lukas said she and the rest of Panther Power will work through the season to make sure students at BBC are a part of the new football experience.

 "We know they're not going to reach championship finals or anything," Lukas said, "so our goal is to make sure everyone has fun anyway."

Headline: Una madre atrapada entre el sacrificio y el sueño
Subheadline: Miguel Olivares
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Siendo muy niña Patricia Rubio le pidió al niño Dios que le trajera dos muñecos para navidad. Aunque su deseo infantil jamás fue complacido, años después la vida le regaló dos hermosos bebés, pero con tan mala suerte que esta vez tampoco ha podido disfrutarlos.

Hace trece años Patricia decidió viajar a los Estados Unidos buscando solventar los apuros económicos de su familia. Jamás imaginó que su osadía tendría que pagarla con lo peor que le puede suceder a una madre: la pérdida de sus hijos. &#8220;Si yo pudiera echar todo esto para atrás yo lo haría, pero teniendo a mis hijos, porque yo te digo una cosa, yo a nadie le deseo ni a nadie le sugiero separarse de un hijo. Esto es un dolor horrible&#8221;.

Los últimos rayos del persistente sol de verano que se cuela por una de las persianas de su modesto apartamento en North Miami destacan en su rostro un matiz de dolor, mientras el sopor del atardecer parece congraciarse con las dificultades de su existencia. &#8220;El tiempo que mis hijos no han estado conmigo yo no la voy a recuperar nunca, a nadie le aconsejo que haga lo que yo hice&#8221;.

Antes de viajar al país del norte, Patricia había llevado una vida sosegada y tranquila en la que no faltó casi nada. Buena educación, una familia estable, un  apreciado grupo de amigos, un buen empleo y la certeza de un futuro promisorio. Repentinamente la estabilidad del hogar se vio amenazada por inesperadas circunstancias familiares. Después de dos prósperas décadas construyendo viviendas, su padre, el arquitecto Nemesio Rubio fue víctima de una estafa que lo dejó en la ruina. &#8220;Yo charlé con mi papá, una persona que yo admiraba, una persona muy leída y muy clara en sus cuestiones y le dije, aquí no queda otra, yo me voy a trabajar a los Estados Unidos&#8221;.

Acompañada por una gran determinación, una fuerte dosis de optimismo y José, su novio en los últimos cinco años, ella armó maletas y se vino al norte. Al poco tiempo de estar aquí, comprendió lo difícil que es abrirse paso en un país ajeno y sintió en carne propia el desarraigo cultural. &#8220;Yo vivía como una princesa en Colombia, estudié en un buen colegio y trabajé en una compañía de seguros, salir de ese mundo y llegar acá y no poder ejercer mi profesión fue duro&#8221;. Mientras intentaba auto imponerse extenuantes jornadas  que le permitieran ganar la mayor cantidad de dinero posible, el destino le hizo una mala jugada regalándole un embarazo no deseado. &#8220;Cuando quedé embarazada no tuve más remedio que viajar a Colombia a tener el bebé&#8221;.

Atrapada entre el deber de cumplir una promesa económica inconclusa y las exigencias impuestas por una maternidad repentina, ella se vio ante una difícil decisión.&#8221;Yo dejé a mi hijo recién nacido con el dolor de mi alma, yo me lo quería traer, pero no pude. Jamás olvidaré su rostro en el aeropuerto cuando me venía&#8221;.

Mientras su madre en Colombia intentaba reinventar la pericia del oficio maternal ya casi olvidado, ella aquí trabajaba de lunes a domingo ejerciendo los más diversos oficios: cuidar ancianos, servir de dama de compañía, atender niños, asistir a personas discapacitadas, arreglar jardines, limpiar casas y hacer el mercado. Sin embargo, ni la alienante rutina laboral ni el puñado de dólares ganados pudieron disipar sus sentimientos de madre recién estrenada. &#8220;Yo le preguntaba a mi mamá en el teléfono por todo lo que hacia el bebé, si se tomaba el tetero, si dormía bien, si botaba los gases, si le salían los dientes&#8221;.


Para sorpresa suya y de sus familiares, pocos meses después que el bebé cumplió su segundo año, ella volvió a quedar embarazada. El viaje a Colombia se impuso nuevamente como la gran solución pero esta vez con un agravante: la imposibilidad de volver a entrar legalmente a los Estados Unidos. &#8220;Me duele que mi hijo no haya nacido aquí, no quiero ni acordarme&#8221;. Sin alcanzar a vivir plenamente la euforia del nacimiento de su segundo hijo, Patricia y José planearon regresar, pero esta vez junto con los niños, razón por la cual contrataron a una vecina que atravesaba por serias penurias económicas para que se encargara de los mismos.

&#8220;La última vez que entró al país ella vino por el hueco, atravesó la frontera mexicana acompañada de su marido, los niños y una vecina que los cuidaba&#8221;, revela Verónica Yunez, una amiga de Patricia que trabaja en West Palm Beach. No obstante, el susto pareció valer la pena. A pesar de tener más obligaciones y estar enfrentada a mayores presiones económicas, ella intentó disfrutar la reunificación familiar hasta donde pudo, pero la felicidad no duró mucho. &#8220;A los pocos meses de su llegada, su marido la abandonó porque se enamoró de la empleada y la dejó tirada con sus hijos&#8221;, concluye Verónica.

Luego de desesperados intentos por trabajar y mantenerse al lado de sus hijos, ella desfallece y con el dolor de su alma aprovecha la visita de un pariente cercano para regresarlos a su casa materna. &#8220;Este es un país precioso, pero aquí no es como allá que hay el abuelo, el tío, el primo, que te ayudan a cuidar el bebé, sino que tienes que arriesgarte a dejarlo tirado a la suerte como un bingo&#8221;.

José David y Miguel Ángel crecieron en Barranquilla, la ciudad natal de sus abuelos y sus padres, y ahora son un par de jovenzuelos de 13 y 10 años respectivamente cursando la secundaria. Si bien techo, ropa y comida no le han faltado, el esmerado cuidado maternal proporcionado por su abuela, ni las fotos o llamadas telefónicas desde los Estados Unidos han logrado borrar la larga ausencia de su madre. &#8220;Ellos cada rato me dicen que cuando van a conocer a su mamá, que cuando va a venir a visitarlos&#8221;, confiesa la abuela.

Por su parte, Patricia ha hecho del ejercicio lejano de su maternidad un rito lleno de argucias e ingenio. &#8220;Yo tengo aquí cosas que le he pedido a mi mamá que me mande, un pedazo de sabanita de mi hijo mayor cuando era bebé, el biberón de mi hijo menor, un mechón de cabello, a veces yo paso y los toco, los beso, los huelo porque siento que hay un poquito de ellos ahí&#8221;.

En Miami, ella continúa con su fuerte rutina de trabajo de lunes a domingo, casi hasta olvidarse de si misma &#8220;A mi lo único que me estimula es cuando yo hablo con ellos por teléfono, gracias a Dios mantengo una comunicación bien chévere. Yo soy amiga de mis hijos&#8221;.

Después del 11 de septiembre las cosas se han puesto bien duras, ella vive al día y casi no puede reunir dinero para enviar a sus hijos. &#8220;Vivir el sueño  americano  para mí ha sido como un cuchillo de doble filo. Gracias a este país mis hijos han podido sobrevivir, pero me he perdido de poder tenerlos y disfrutarlos durante todos estos años&#8221;.

Cada vez que Alina Fernández se mira al espejo le dan ganas de llorar, y ya no son los gorditos de más lo que la atormenta, sino las cicatrices que le quedaron en el estómago por querer adelgazar. Una cirugía mal practicada para reducir el estómago le arruinó la vida. 

No son sólo las marcas sino la cantidad de complicaciones posteriores: hernia, fibrosis, estafilococos, principios de esepticemia. Imposibilitada para trabajar y para llevar una vida normal, Alina ha tenido varios intentos de suicidio.

El peso de pesar menos

Hace dos años con la idea de quitarse unos kilos del estómago, acudió al médico colombiano Ricardo Castro, un hombre anciano con licencia de cirujano plástico. Alina y su hermana de crianza, Martha Rodríguez, le pidieron su licencia, verificaron los papeles sobre el seguro de salud y miraron las fotos de pacientes operados con éxito anteriormente. Decidieron juntas someterse a la cirugía conocida como "Tummy-Tuck".

El doctor Ricardo nunca le habló a Martha, con problemas de obesidad, de los riesgos que se corren al operar personas en esta condición. A ella debían quitarle 22 libras, a Alina dos. El 14 de septiembre Alina entró al quirófano que quedaba en el mismo consultorio, 15 días después lo hizo Martha. Ambas salieron muy adoloridas pero confiadas pensando en las libras de menos y en la pronta recuperación que tendrían en casa. 

Pasado un mes, ni Alina ni Martha se recuperaron de la operación. Sara Martínez, la otra "doctora&#8221; del consultorio revisó a Alina y le aseguró que estaba perfecta. Una semana después Alina vio en la televisión el arresto de un grupo médico en Coral Gables. El noticiero publicó los teléfonos para denunciar los doctores sin licencia. 

De inmediato Alina llamó al departamento de investigaciones para medicina sin licencia del Florida Health Department y salió, junto con su hermana, de emergencia al hospital. Ninguna de las dos tenía costuras internas. 

Las verdades adentro

&#8220;Cuando llegué al hospital nadie quería atenderme porque ningún doctor se quería hacer responsable de un caso que no era suyo&#8221;, se queja Alina. 

Les dieron una primera atención por insistencia de Enrique Torres, jefe de la división de investigaciones de medicina sin licencia, pero a Alina la devolvieron ese mismo día para la casa. A Martha la dejaron hospitalizada porque se estaba desangrando.

Cuando los médicos la revisaron descubrieron que la carne de Martha se estaba pudriendo. "Tuvieron que cortarme pedazos enteros de carne que salía verde  porque yo estaba podrida toda", comenta Martha. 
 
Cuando allanaron el consultorio del doctor Castro se dieron cuenta de que no era él quien operaba a los pacientes, sino Daniel Jiménez, quien no tenía estudios médicos conocidos y quien aparecía en escena una vez los pacientes estaban dormidos con la anestesia. Al despertar, los pacientes sólo veían las caras del doctor Castro y de la "doctora" Sara Martínez. Martínez tampoco tenía ninguna preparación, era simplemente la dueña del local, pero se ponía todo el disfraz de médica", comenta  Enrique Torres.

Números en rojo

El arresto del grupo y la primera visita al médico fue apenas el comienzo de un drama largo para Alina y para Martha. Según ellas, cuando se enteraron de las secuelas, los agentes del estado prometieron que les iban a dar ayuda económica suficiente del fondo de compensación de víctimas de ataques violentos.
 
Durante el primer año recibieron una ayuda de $20.000 dólares; pero según Torres, este dinero de compensación es mínimo. &#8220;No es nada comparado con todos los gastos que tienen&#8221;. Hasta el día de hoy es todo lo que ha recibido Alina, quien ha acudido a cuanto estamento existe en busca de apoyo económico. Todos le cierran las puertas.

Justicia agravada

Hoy están viviendo a deuda y de la caridad de la familia, esperando la indemnización que quizás les corresponda con el juicio. Su vida depende ahora del dinero que resulte tras la condena del doctor Castro y su grupo, pero el juicio ha sido aplazado más de tres veces. Además, en realidad, en ningún caso los juicios penales incluyen indemnización de víctimas.

Daniel Jiménez tiene seis cargos en su contra. Tres por crimen agravado de primer grado con daños corporales, que podría darle una condena entre los 15 años y la cadena perpetua, y tres por práctica de cuidados profesionales de salud sin licencia, que podría condenarlo a un máximo de 15 años. Los mismos cargos tienen el doctor Castro y Sara Martínez, sumados a otro cargo más por intentar persuadir a los testigos del juicio a declarar en su contra.

Sin embargo, varios meses después del arresto el doctor Ricardo Castro fue dejado en libertad bajo fianza. Alina no entiende cómo un médico con los fondos en blanco puede pagar una fianza para salir libre, pero cada vez que alguna de las hermanas llama a preguntar por los avances en el caso, las secretarias de los fiscales les contestan con evasivas. Hoy el médico Ricardo Castro está fuera de las rejas y tiene vigente su licencia médica porque ningún profesional pierde su licencia hasta que no ha sido condenado.

De la primera indemnización ellas aseguran que no les queda un peso. "Los $20.000 dólares los usamos en pagar la renta y darle de comer a los hijos. Ellos nos dijeron que esa plata era para los médicos pero ¿qué vamos a ir al médico si no tenemos que comer?, nos operan y nos morimos de hambre", comenta Alina desesperada y llena de dolores. "No nos han operado nada porque no tenemos cómo pagar, vivimos a punta de pastillas", dice Martha con voz llorosa mientras sujeta fuerte un tarro de pastillas que mantiene permanentemente entre las manos. Son distintas: unas para el dolor, otras para la tristeza. A los problemas se suma la depresión.

Deuda siquiátrica

Luego de varios intentos de suicidio, ambas tuvieron que someterse a tratamientos siquiátricos. Martha con voz  entrecortada cuenta que su vida perdió el sentido, que ella ha preferido morirse a pasar por lo que está pasando. Según ellas, el siquiatra considera que su caso debería considerarse catastrófico para tener ayudas completas. Lo cierto es que las víctimas de las cirugías ilegales no entran en este rango. 

Se considera una víctima catastrófica  cuando ha tenido mutilación de algunos de sus miembros. Ellas no entran en ese rango. "No entiendo porque a nosotras no nos consideran casos catastróficos, nosotras somos catastróficas. A mí no me falta un dedo, me falta casi toda la barriga", dice Alina llena de indignación.

Ellas reclaman que el doctor Castro por tener licencia debía tener un seguro que cubriera los posibles daños a los pacientes. El seguro que ellas vieron no era válido. Nadie responde al respecto. Tal parece, según Torres,  que todo el dinero que pudiera tener el doctor lo escondió en cuentas distintas y en su cuenta no hay un centavo para ellas.
 
Después de mucho pelear Martha y Alina lograron que el Estado les financie el 50% del tratamiento siquiátrico. Esa fue la última palabra. ¿Quién va a pagar el resto? Se preguntan ambas, "si nosotras no tenemos ni en dónde caernos muertas". 
Alina debe hoy aproximadamente $60.000 dólares en el hospital Panamerican donde la atendieron, debe la renta, le debe a amigos y a la familia. &#8220;El terrorismo que hicieron en  las torres lo van a pagar los culpables, y el que me hicieron a mí, quién me lo paga? porque lo que me hicieron a mí es un acto de terrorismo&#8221;, dice Alina con voz llorosa.

...y el Estado dónde está?

¿A quién culpar de lo sucedido? Según Jorge, hermano de Alina y quien ha invertido buena parte de su dinero en ayudarla, el culpable es el estado que permite que se hagan cirugías en lugares distintos a los hospitales y que no revisa las licencias cada cierto tiempo. 

El coincide con  Enrique Torres en que además el estado no le da la importancia que debiera a estos casos y por eso las penas y las multas son tan pequeñas (según él, nunca exceden los tres años.

Después del caso de Alina el estado está empezando a investigar seriamente las licencias de los médicos. &#8220;Sólo ahora se están empezando a inspeccionar las clínicas, cómo es posible que hayan esperado tanto?, se pregunta Jorge. &#8220;Antes nos tocaba rogarle a los policías para que nos acompañen a hacer el arresto. Nosotros no podemos allanar ni hacer arrestos, nuestra función se limita a la investigación", comenta Torres. 

La historia continúa

El caso de Alina Fernández y Martha Rodríguez no es un caso aislado. Hace tres años se creó la división para investigación de medicina ilegal. Se han verificado aproximadamente 1000 casos de todo tipo de prácticas médicas ilegales desde entonces. Hoy Enrique Torres y su equipo tiene aproximadamente 300 casos abiertos; en lo que ha corrido del año fiscal ha tenido 37 casos y desde enero unos diez.

Lo preocupante de la situación es que, según Torres, por cada caso que se resuelve surgen 3 o 4 más. &#8220;Estas prácticas son como una plaga&#8221;, asegura.

Mientras tanto, Alina sigue tocando puertas entre idas y venidas al hospital y al siquiatra. Mientras tanto, Martha carga sus heridas mucho más pesadas que los kilos que soñó dejar de pesar. Mientras tanto, en cualquier lugar, a la vuelta de la esquina, alguien más le arruina la vida a otra mujer....

&nbsp;
Has estado trabajando todo el día y tienes una clase de 6:30 pm a 9:05 pm.  Llegas a la clase justo en el preciso momento que comienza, te sientas, escuchas, tomas notas y constantemente miras al reloj.  De repente&#8230; ¡qué felicidad, ya es hora de terminar!  Metes tus libros en la bolsa, dices hasta luego a los compañeros de clase y al profesor.  

Te apresuras hacia el estacionamiento, suena tu celular y lo contestas.  La conversación te entretiene tanto que olvidas buscar las llaves del carro antes de llegar a el.  &#8220;Qué fastidio no encuentro las llaves, te llamo más tarde&#8221;, terminas la llamada y buscas en el fondo de tu bolsa.  Encuentras un bolígrafo, el polvo compacto, tu cepillo, los &#8220;Tic-Tacs&#8221; pero de las llaves&#8230;nada. Decides entonces sacudir la bolsa hasta que las ruidosas llaves te dicen, &#8220;¡aquí estamos!&#8221;.  Han pasado sólo minutos.  Agarras por fin las llaves, buscas la que te abrirá la puerta y&#8230;algo mucho más fuerte que tú aprieta tus brazos haciendo que te estremezcas de dolor y miedo.  Tratas de forcejear pero escuchas una voz grave y nerviosa que dice, &#8220;no te muevas y ni si te ocurra gritar&#8221;.  Y ahora, ¿qué haces?

Afortunadamente, un escenario como este no ha sido muy común en nuestra universidad.  De acuerdo a las estatísticas publicadas por el departamento de policía de FIU, sólo se han reportado dos casos de violación forzada entre los años 1998 y 2000; uno en el recinto de University Park en 1999 y otro en el recinto de Biscayne Bay en el 2000.  No obstante, es importante recalcar que aunque se reportado una disminución de actos criminales en el condado de Miami-Dade, la incidencia criminal aquí soprepasa aún a la de otras grandes comunidades.  

Un artículo publicado por el Miami Herald el 6 de abril de este año, informó que el porcentaje de crímenes en Miami-Dade es más alto que el porcentaje calculado por el Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) a nivel estatal.  Esto significa que el riesgo de convertirse en una estadística criminal en este condado resulta mayor que en otras ciudades.  Para la mujer, implica la posibilidad de sufrir un ataque más personal que envuelve daño físico al igual que emocional.

En el folleto publicado por el Departamento de Salud de la Florida, titulado Después del Ataque Sexual se explica que &#8220;las víctimas del abuso sexual experimentan varias reacciones y sentimientos incluyendo la ira, la depresión, la confusión, la frustación, el sentimiento de desamparo e insomnio y diversos problemas en su vida de relación&#8221;. Sin embargo, existen una variedad de programas de prevención y ayuda para las víctimas de violación de la cual toda mujer puede participar.  

En FIU se extiende a todo el cuerpo estudiantil femenino, la facultad y todas las empleadas de la universidad.  El programa se conoce como RAD (Rape Aggression Defense), es totalmente gratis y tiene como objetivo principal el de entrenar a la mujer a utilizar varias tácticas que podrían impedir el ataque sexual.  La sargento Shawna McNeil, del departamento de policía de FIU, explica que el curso incluye consejos para evitar situaciones precarias, el uso de las manos como armas y localizar las areas sensibles del atacante, entre otras cosas.  En adición, se les enseña a las estudiantes a romper con las reglas de los buenos modales y demostrar al agresor que no permitirán ser victimizadas, &#8220;le enseñamos a las estudiantes a verbalizar, a decir que no&#8221;, dice la sargento.  

McNeil añade además, que si una víctima no toma ninguna clase de acción, el victimario tendrá un cien por ciento de éxito, sin embargo; si se toman medidas rápidas y educadas para evitar el crimen, el porcentaje será mucho más bajo.  RAD da la respuesta al escenario previamente presentado.  Cada clase prepara a la estudiante con el conocimiento necesario para evitar que un intento de violación no culmine en lo peor. En realidad, no hay excusa para no beneficiarse de tan importante programa.  

Los cursos se ofrecen en University Park mayormente durante la noche en los semestres de otoño y primavera aunque, de acuerdo con la sargento McNeil, se podría acomodar a aquellas estudiantes que deseen tomarlo durante el verano. El programa comprende de tres clases de cuatro horas cada una.  La primera clase es básicamente una orientación y discusión del manual que se utilizará. En el segundo día, se aprenden los aspectos físicos y las tácticas a usar. La última clase es para asimilar todo lo aprendido.  El completar todas la horas requeridas por el curso, no suministra una certificación pero sí un entedimiento más claro de todas las opciones disponibles en caso de que hagan falta. Los instructores del programa son los uniformados de FIU en conjunto con la policía de la Universidad de Miami y Barry University.

Tomar ventaja de este programa es muy fácil.  Para matricularse o pedir más información, sólo es necesario comunicarse con el departamento de policía de la universidad al teléfono (305) 348-2626.  

RAD está en peligro de extinción, la matrícula ha sido mínima en los últimos meses y la sargento McNeil no asegura la duración del programa.  Este es un instrumento de defensa, se inteligente y utilízalo.

Headline: Las elecciones acortan las distancias

&nbsp;
Son aproximadamente tres horas en avión las que separan los principales aeropuertos de Miami y Bogotá. Sin embargo, la distancia no fue suficiente para detener los corazones de los 27,317 colombianos residentes en Florida que votaron para las elecciones presidenciales de su país, el pasado 26 de mayo.

María Clara Valencia, estudiante colombiana de FIU, explicó la importancia de participar en las elecciones, a pesar de encontrarse fuera de su país: "Colombia necesita todas las manos posibles. Por el hecho de estar por fuera del país tenemos un compromiso mayor con Colombia". Natalia Vélez, también estudiante de FIU, señala que "los votos se suman acá (Miami) y cuentan igual que si estuvieras en Colombia".

Para Stephanie Kisner estudiante del Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, fue importante votar para "actuar en beneficio del país y contribuir para que Colombia mejore".  

Las elecciones presidenciales probaron que el estar fuera de un país no es impedimento para decidir sobre su futuro. Por el contrario, las elecciones sirvieron para borrar la distancia.

Algunos colombianos que votaron en Florida, como la estudiante de FIU María Clara Báez, se sintieron en su país de origen, a pesar de encontrarse a tres horas de camino en avión: "me transporté y sentí como si estuviera votando en Unicentro (un conocido centro comercial de Bogotá)". María Clara cuenta que lo logró acercarla a su país fue el ambiente que se vivió en el Consulado Colombiano en Coral Gables: "la música colombiana; la comida como los dulces de café, obleas con arequipe y sobre todo, las peleas entre seguidores de Serpa y Uribe". 

María Clara explica que los partidarios de los principales candidatos Alvaro Uribe y Horacio Serpa, intercambiaban ideas sobre las diferentes ideologías políticas de sus candidatos, de la misma forma que se hace en Bogotá, la capital colombiana donde solía votar.

En Pembroke Pines, las elecciones presidenciales también transformaron la ciudad. Stephanie Kisner se sintió en su país al entrar en el hospital donde estaban ubicadas las mesas de votación: "estaba todo lleno de banderas colombianas; la gente abría sus carros y ponía música típica colombiana, y todo el mundo te pasaba papelitos de sus candidatos y de negocios de colombianos en Miami". 

El ambiente colombiano de Coral Gables y Pembroke Pines fue compartido por los otros cinco centros de votación de la Florida en Tampa, Orlando, West Palm Beach, Weston, Kendall y Hialeah. 

La nostalgia e ilusión de cambio fueron los sentimientos que invadieron los corazones de los colombianos residentes en la Florida en estas elecciones presidenciales. "Confío en que el Presidente elegido ponga un primer grano en la solución de los problemas del país", dijo María Clara Valencia. Stephanie Kisner cuenta que sintió emoción al ser la primera vez que votaba y al mismo tiempo, "esperanza de que la situación de Colombia mejore".

La elección del nuevo Presidente de Colombia Alvaro Uribe Vélez, no sólo será decisiva para el país, sino también, para los miles de colombianos que viven en el exterior, que quienes como María Clara Báez, quieren tener la opción de regresar y no verse resignados a permanecer por fuera, dada la situación de violencia e inseguridad económica de Colombia.

Headline: Men's soccer faces early challenges, looks to improve
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team has experienced reaching the pinnacle, when they were ranked No. 1 in the country and worked its way to the national championship game in 1996, and falling short, as they did last season, being eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Championships in Dallas, Texas by the University of New Mexico.

The team ended its 2001 season with a 10-8 record.

"We have an experienced club with good additions," head coach Karl Kremser said when speaking about his team's outlook. 

"The winner of the conference now gets an automatic bid into the tournament. We expect to win [the conference]," the coach confidently stated.

Kremser knows talent when he sees it. The coach has been in his profession for over 30 years and is now in his 23rd season with the Golden Panthers. Additionally, Kremser boasts a 272-136-33 record.

While FIU was a Division II program, Kremser led his teams to four national championship game appearances, winning two.

"We expect a lot from guys like Matias [Asorey], Roy Rosenberg, Ezequiel [Romero] and [Hendrix] Emanuel. We also have a transfer coming in, Mark Stevenson, who we tried to recruit earlier and now we have him."

Asorey played in all nineteen matches last season, starting eighteen.  He finished with a team-leading eight goals and nineteen points. 

Rosenberg had 59 saves as the squads goalkeeper in 2001.

Romero was second on the team with four goals.

Emanuel played in nine games in a reserve role.

The road to a conference title and a bid into the NCAA tourney won't be easy. 

The team will hit the road to  face Fullerton and UCLA in California and travel for contests against William and Mary's and St. John's University in New York.

"Those match-ups are all in the first two weeks of the season," Kremser said. "UCLA is ranked in the top 10 every year. Playing them will be a true test."

Kremser remains confident even with the early challenges lying ahead."We're looking forward to a good year."

Subheadline: Football dominates St. Peters with 27-3 win in front of sell-out crowd
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;

FIU football arrived in a big way on Thursday night.

The Golden Panthers dominated the first half and then cruised to a 27-3 win over St. Peter's College in front of a sell-out crowd of 17,314 at Golden Panther Community Stadium.

"I told the players I'd build them a house, I'd build them a field, I'd build them a stadium, and like a field of dreams, we built it and they came," emotional FIU head coach Don Strock said. "Great players make great coaches."

All of FIU's scoring came in the game's first 28 minutes as the Golden Panthers got into the endzone on four of the team's first five possessions.

"Things didn't happen the way we wanted them to early," St. Peter's coach Rob Stern said. "The first fifteen minutes of the game got away from us. The big turning point was that first drive. [FIU] put the ball on the ground twice. Last year we got 47 turnovers. If we get those plays, maybe things will go differently."

FIU's first half play calling appeared to have St. Peter's on its heels for most of the 30 minutes.

Jamie Burke started the fireworks early when he completed a five-yard touchdown pass to fullback Jerrid Lundstedt, who caught the ball just shy of the endzone before sneaking it over the goal line. The score came with 8:18 remaining in the first quarter and opened the door for what would become a route.

Tori Robinson fumbled twice on the drive, but FIU recovered to preserve the scoring opportunity.

Burke struck again with 1:47 remaining in the opening quarter, when the true-freshman took a quarterback draw up the middle for a six-yard touchdown run, giving FIU a 13-0 lead.

That second score was set-up when John Haritan blocked a punt.

"What we did early was spread them out with four wide receivers," Strock said. "We didn't think they had the personnel to match up. They were in their base defense and we had guys running free through the middle of the field and we made a couple of plays.

Burke finished the game with 115 yards on 10-13 passing and two touchdowns.

Burke's longest completion of the game came with the Golden Panthers leading 19-0. FIU put the game out of St. Peter's reach when Cory McKinney caught a 52-yard pass from Burke and raced down the right sideline for a 27-0 lead. 

McKinney finished with 103 yards on 3 catches.

Julius Eppinger, Harold Leath and Everett Mitchell came up with key catches during the game, combining for five receptions and 69 yards.

FIU's four touchdowns came against a Peacock defense that ranked No. 1 in Division 1AA defense last season, but lost six starters from that team. St. Peter's allowed only six touchdowns over its final nine games last season and was the No. 1-ranked defense in Division I-AA, allowing 8.2 points per game, on its way to a 10-1 record.

"We knew what they did last year, and we knew what we had to do," Burke said.

Trailing by the same score at halftime, St. Peter's refused to abandon its wing-T, option offense and never got back into the game, despite owning a five-minute advantage in possession time.

Rashod Smith and Robinson combined for 82 yards rushing for FIU and Smith scored on a two-yard run in the second quarter.

Both teams rushed for over 100 yards, with the Peacocks running for 143, but FIU won the game in the air. The Golden Panthers out-gained St. Peter's 167-76 in the passing game.

FIU's defense came up strong on third down, stopping St. Peter's on 14 of 15 chances.

Haritan and Nick Turnbull led the Golden Panthers with six tackles each and Nick Carreno recorded the team's only sack. Both Turnbull and Gentry Jackson had interceptions.

The score could have been more lopsided.

The Golden Panthers had a John Haritan interception, deep in St. Peter's territory, called back on a penalty and fumbled five times, losing two. FIU also missed two extra-point attempts.

St. Peter's lone score came on James Galea's 32-yard field goal with 4:33 remaining. Those were the only points of the second half as the teams played to a stalemate.

"Once we got ahead, it was hard for them to run the ball and grind it out, making it hard for them to catch up," Strock said.

"In college football, guys just don't come out and layout down," Stern said. "They played hard in the second half. I think we showed a little better what St. Peter's football is all about in the second half. Hats off to those guys. They're going to have a successful year."

Andre Harris, the Peacocks' starting quarterback, completed five of 12 passes for 28 yards. He also rushed 12 times for 48 yards.

Derek Clayton led all rushers with 72 yards.

FIU will travel to Elon and St. Peter's plays at Fordham on Sept. 7.

Headline: Volleyball hungry for better year
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
The question is supposed to be a little more difficult than they made it seem.

Is anything less than what you accomplished last year considered acceptable?

Elizabeth Baldwin, Adriana Fundora, Betsy Moreland and Jennifer Owens all shook their heads simultaneously as if the question was as easy as a first-grade math problem.

Coming off the best season in the volleyball program's history, the Golden Panthers want more.

"I expect to improve upon last year," Fundora said. "Hopefully, we win the Sun Belt Conference again and make it past the second round of the NCAA's."

Their coach, Cookie Stevens isn't as quick to make this a one-goal season, pointing to the improvement that other Sun Belt teams have made.

"Other teams have reloaded. We haven't really reloaded," Stevens explained. 

"We've gotten the group stronger. But other teams have added new faces. The expectations we are setting are just getting better."

After winning its first Sun Belt Championship and advancing to the round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament, FIU knows that, unlike in years past, it is no longer the underdog.

"It's a little different," Stevens said. "In the past three years, we haven't been that way. No one is going to take us for granted anymore. They are out to get us."

Last season, on its way to a 24-8 record and No. 6 ranking in the South Region, FIU started 9-5 before winning 19 of its final 23 games. During that run, the Golden Panthers went 8-3 in five game matches.

"Confidence wise, they are very familiar with each other," she said. 

"The chemistry is already intact and we're building on that. They know that we don't have the most athletic girls, but its what we do as a team that counts."

FIU will be tested early, as it plays four pre-conference tournaments that include five teams that finished ranked in the NCAA women's volleyball preseason polls.

"We still feel that in the pre-conference tournaments, we are still the underdog," Stevens said.

The Golden Panthers begin the season on the road for tournaments at San Diego State and Xavier. They host the FIU Invitational on Sept. 13-14. 

FIU begins the conference schedule Sept. 27 at Arkansas State. 

The SBC Tournament will be held in FIU's Golden Panther Arena on Sept. 21-23.

Subheadline: 2000 recruiting class leads Golden Panther volleyball into new era
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Two years ago, head coach Cookie Stevens asked seven players to join her at FIU and help rebuild a program that had gone 27-61 in the three previous years.

Those seven players, six then freshman and one college transefer now 
have FIU defending a Sun Belt Conference championship and thinking about more.

"When I recruited them, I talked to each and every one of them about 
helping me build this program," Stevens said.

Mission accomplished.

Juniors Debra Amundson, Adriana Fundora, Charyln Ball-Llovera, Jennifer Owens, Elizabeth Baldwin, Betsy Moreland and senior Nirvana Kos have done just that.

Last season, FIU went 24-9 while winning 19 of its final 23 matches on the way to the conference championship and an appearance in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

In 2001, the recruiting class of 2000 accounted for 1,660 of the teams 1,945 kills (85 percent) and 1,666 of 1,741 assists (96 percent).

"[The class] is more than half the team," Owens said. "We kind of set the tone for how we want to play and what type of team we want to be.

"The new players who just came in see that. We are the older ones now."

"We're the backbone of the team," Moreland added.

In two years, when each member of the program-building class has left FIU, their names will be implanted in the FIU record books.

Kos already owns the team's all-time kills record with 1,145. After this, her final season, she will be surpased by teammate Fundora, who has one more year than Kos, the transfer.

Similar situations will occur througout the record books.

Baldwin ranks second in assists and a handful of players have chances to rank top-3 categories.

The recruiting class of 2000's members are in position to own records in kills, service aces, digs, assists and blocks. 

"They've come leaps and bounds and they have meant an extreme amount to this program," Stevens said. "They feel strong ownership to what has happened here the last two years.

So, what's the best way to describe seven people who took a program from complete obscurity to a first round win in the NCAA tournament?

"We're very important," Owens said, only half-jokingly.

The record books agree.

Headline: Record breaking high school star hopes for success
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Jamie Burke put together a senior season to remember at Cardinal Mooney high school.

Last fall, the Sarasota native passed for 2,835 yards and 34 touchdown passes. Both totals were school records. Along the way, Burke became the first quarterback in Florida to pass for over 500 yards in a game.

With awards, honors and scholarships being thrown his way, the 6-4, 215 pound quarterback was missing only one thing – an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

Burke tore his right ACL, a small stabilizing ligament within the center of the knee, which prevents hyperextension and excessive rotation to the joint. The injury came in the season's first game – the game that was supposed to be Burke's comeback attempt from the identical injury that forced him to sit out his junior season.

This type of injury is supposed to keep a player on the sidelines for up to 
12 months, but Burke post-poned surgery and didn't let the injury keep him out of Cardinal Mooney's line-up for a second straight year.

"He played all of last year without an ACL," Mike Dowling, Burke's high school coach, said. "I've been coaching here for 25 years. He's one of the highest quality players I've had."

Choosing FIU

Burke's journey to FIU was almost as extraordinary as his high school senior season.

Burke orally committed to the upstart FIU program, before electing to accept a scholarship to the University of Florida. 

Those plans came to a halt, when Steve Spurrier chose to leave the Gator program and take the head coaching position with the NFL's Washington Redskins.

Thirty minutes before Burke planned to announce his intention to become a Gator, FIU head coach Don Strock called Burke to inform him that Spurrier was no longer the coach at Florida.

The Gators' interest in Burke didn't change, but Burke no longer was sure that he wanted to be in Gainesville.

"They still wanted to recruit me," Burke said. "They still wanted me to be a Gator."

Burke would end up at FIU, battling David Tabor for the starting quarterback position.

Strock didn't try to hide his excitement when announcing FIU's February recruiting class.

"I'd like to thank Steve Spurrier for taking the Redskins job," Strock joked that day.

"During my couple visits down here, I enjoyed my time," Burke explained. "They made me feel real comfortable. With Spurrier leaving, that basically made my decision."

Burke also sees a chance to benefit from Strock's 16 years of NFL experience.

"If I can learn a fraction of what he knows, I'll be good," Burke said. "He explains things so well that it is easy to pick-up."

After arriving on campus, Burke set his sights on competing for the starting job and learning Strock's 200-play offensive system.

Last week, Strock put his six-inch playbook in the hands of the true freshman.

Burke, who started learning the system in February, impressed the former Miami Dolphin with his ability to move the offense.

"It wasn't an easy decision,'' Strock said. "[Burke and Tabor] had outstanding camps. But I think with Burke we'll be able to push the ball downfield a little better."

High school glory

Dowling, who has known Burke since the quarterback was eight years old, thinks that Burke will flourish as the field general in the wide-open, three wide receiver offense.

"When he was [at Cardinal Mooney], we put in Auburn's passing offense, with reads and everything else. We put a lot of pressure on him."

"At every level, he's been the best quarterback," Dowling added. "He's got great technique. He has the softest touch I've ever seen. He always throws a catchable ball."

Burke was very catchable on a Friday night last fall. While hobbling and in pain, Burke put together what is the single-greatest passing performance in Florida high school football.

Burke threw for 506 yards in a 42-32 shootout loss to St. Petersburg Catholic. 

Behind early, Cardinal Mooney was forced to go almost completely to the passing game and Burke completed 28 of 52 attempts and had three touchdowns.

"Even though we lost, that was an incredible achievement for me," Burke said. "We were throwing the ball all game. Everyone was banged up."

"He just put on a show," Dowling said. "It was a two-way show. It wasn't like we were playing someone who wasn't any good. They finished 10-1."

Dowling says that Jamie Burke can be summed up in one play that occurred a few weeks after the 500-yard contest.

"He's such a competitor. It's the greatest thing I remember him doing," Dowling said. "We were leading Booker 27-14 and they were closing. Jamie runs right down the field and gets a key first down. He risks injury. It's reckless abandon."

The Present

For now, the guy who showed toughness through that high school injury will be leading the offense of a coach who requires toughness.

The head coach makes use of the phrase "There's a difference between pain and injury," as if it's a tape recorded message.

Burke mirrors his coach in another way too – he doesn't want to look too far into the future or discuss the expectations that  traveled with him from Sarasota,  preferring to focus on the team that he will lead into FIU's inaugural game.

"I think our team is going to do well," he said. "I think we are going to be better than people think."

Burke will be looking to ride hard work to success.

'"All I dream about is football,'' Burke said following one practice. "If I'm not throwing touchdown passes and winning games, I'm hearing Coach [Don Strock] in my head. The playbook - don't even get me started. I've had nightmares about that.'"

"I came here and I wanted to start," Burke said. "I thought I had a good chance to start. I came in here with a lot of hard work. I went over the play book every night."

So, for now, Burke will leave the expectation building to others.
And Dowling, who has known the QB for 10 years, is a little more willing to share his hopes for his one-time pupil.

"Hopefully, he's going to set all the records at FIU, too," Dowling said.

Headline: Burke to lead FIU offense in inaugural game
Subheadline: Quarterback Tabor will also receive playing time for Golden Panthers
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Jamie Burke, a true freshman, will start the Golden Panther football team's inaugural game against St. Peters. Back-up David Tabor will also get playing time.

Head coach Don Strock named Burke the starter over Tabor on Aug. 21 and informed each quarterback in one-on-one meetings.

Unless either Burke or Tabor are injured, FIU will red-shirt Josh Padwick.

"They all worked hard," Strock said. "We're comfortable with David coming off the bench. If something goes hay-wire, I need someone who knows what we're doing."

"Dave will play in the first game. He'll probably play in every game," he added.

Tabor is part of FIU's first-ever recruiting class and Burke officially became a Golden Panther this past February.


Strock, a career-NFL back up, places a large importance on the No. 2 position.

"For me, I'm a career back-up, so I know what I want in the second guy, coming off the sideline," Strock said.

"With Jamie, we pushed the ball down the field a little better."
Burke, who had originally committed to the University of Florida before Steve Spurrier went to the NFL, set his sights on the starting job when he arrived on campus.

"I came here and I wanted to start," Burke said. "I thought I had a good chance to start. I came in here with a lot of hard work. I went over the play book every night."

Tabor refuses to dwell on the decision and will focus on the task ahead of him.

"I feel pretty good about the whole situation. Obviously, there is a little heartache," Tabor said. "There are no hard feelings. It's a difficult situation."

Padwick ran the option at Merritt Island High School and must adjust to Strock's wide-open, one running back offense.

Headline: Strock focusing on big picture
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
With all of FIU's attention focusing on Thursday's inaugural game against St. Peter's, head coach Don Strock is thinking about a bigger picture.

Strock is focused on the entire 11-game schedule and hopes his players do the same.

"I'm afraid of [focusing too much on the St. Peter's game]. I'm afraid of my players doing that," he said. 

"They're looking for someone to tell them what to think about. I tell them, 'Hey, listen. We're starting an 11-game season. St. Peter's is our first game. We have to go from there.'"

The former NFL quarterback learned this lesson first-hand when he was in college.

"Years ago, when I was at Virginia Tech, we played Alabama in the first game. We put so much emphasis on Alabama the whole camp – six weeks of Alabama. We lost to Alabama 14-7. We were ranked 20th in the country."

That loss sent his team into a tailspin that resulted in an 0-5 start.

"The second game, we played William & Mary and they beat us 21-7. We go, 'wait a minute. We played Alabama and its 14-7, then William & Mary beats us 21-14. Something's not right here.' Then you get that confidence thing as a team and next thing you know, you're 0-5 and you're fighting for your life."

After spending a year and a half preparing for St. Peter's, Strock is eager to learn how his team reacts to the routine of the regular season. Preperation for Elon will be much shorter.

"It will be interesting to see how they react. Win, lose or draw – it doesn't matter," Strock said. "When they come back next Monday, we have to go out and do it again."

"We've been preparing for a year and a half for this game," Strock added. "All of a sudden, you only have five days to get ready for Elon and we have to fly there. It will be interesting to see how they react to that pace – then go to school at the same time. It will be hard."

Headline: Edwards looks to rebuild women's soccer
Author: Pete Pelegrin/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In Everton Edwards' native England, the changing of the Buckingham Palace guards is precise and punctual.  

At FIU,  Edwards, the women's soccer coach, could only wish the changes on his team from last season to this upcoming one were just as precise and punctual.

It remains that the only thing constant is change.	

For the upcoming season, the team has dealt with three important changes happening within a month of each other.

The first change was inevitable.  Leading scorers from last season, Michele O'Brien and Sasja Odenyo both graduated.

Next the team learned they would be without goalkeeper Amy Staley, who will not play this season due to personal reasons.  Less than a month later, assistant coach Frankie Delgado informed the team he would be leaving to become the head soccer coach at Gulliver Academy. Delgado coached three seasons for the Golden Panthers.

With the losses mounting and the season yet to begin, Edwards still remains upbeat.

"It's a new beginning," Edwards said.  "We'll definitely miss everyone that will not be with us this season, but we have to go on in the future and not look back at the past."

The future of the team begins with exactly that, the team, or the team concept.

"Our work ethic is one of our bigger strengths," captain and defender Ifeoma Dieke said.  "It's not about one or two individuals.  It's about the team.  We win as a team and we lose as a team."

Dieke, along with Rossana Lopez and Michelle Torre, is part of an experienced group of defenders that will help out the team's lone goalkeeper, Adrienne McWilliams.

"Ife (Ifeoma Dieke) and I work well together," McWilliams said.  "I know how she works as a sweeper and that will only help our confidence as a team."

"We definitely have a lot more team speed than before," Lopez said.  
"We're technically sound in the fundamentals and coach Edwards positions the players well."

Among the players Edwards will be positioning to compensate for the 26 goals and 61 points the team will be missing from O'Brien and Odenyo are midfielder/forward Nicola Bell and midfielders Janessa Taddei and Charissa Gingerich.

Bell, who was third on the team last year with seven goals, thinks they'll be just fine with a minor adjustment.

"Our midfielders are our strength," Bell said.  

"Most of them are returning and we're a tight unit with good chemistry, but we have to be more aggressive. At times last year no one wanted the responsibility to take the shot, but that will change this year."

"We have to stay focused for 90 minutes and try and attack more and not be complacent," Bell added.

A major focus for the team will be the onus placed on goalkeeper McWilliams.

She will be challenged to maintain the goalkeeping standards Staley set last year (0.74 goals against average and .828 save percentage).

"This is going to be a huge year for me," McWilliams said.  "There's more pressure, but I perform well when things get tough."

Looking to perform well and not just sit on the bench will be some of the freshmen such as Liz Durozel, who scored 90 goals in her career at Westminster Christian and Carly Goldich and Kendell Hommel who are part of Olympic Development teams.

"We are always looking for a big impact from our new recruits," Edwards said.  "We're not looking for them to sit on the bench.  We're looking for them to fight for a job."

The schedule will have a big impact on how far the Golden Panthers go in 2002.  

FIU will play six teams that went to the NCAA Tournament last season.

The Golden Panthers open the season in the Florida Atlantic Tournament on August 30th against Western Carolina and Sept. 1 versus Memphis.

The home opener against FAU hopes to be a memorable one on a noteworthy date, Sept. 11th.

Among the schedule highlights are a trip to Tobacco Road as the Golden Panthers take on NCAA runner-up North Carolina and Duke.  The Golden Panthers resume their cross-town rivalry with the University of Miami, while Seton Hall and Villanova make their first appearances at FIU.
FIU, who had a 6-1-1 record in the Sun Belt last year, will be eagerly awaiting Middle Tennessee for the start of conference play Sept. 27.

"The schedule gets tougher every year," Dieke said.  "The quality and standard of the teams keep getting better, but if we want to improve that's who we need to play."

The Golden Panthers will be looking to improve on last year's 11-4-2 record and second round finish in the Sun Belt Tournament.  

As one of the top teams in the conference, they believe they can.

"Our first priority is to win the Sun Belt," Lopez said.  

"Then we take it from there, if we make it farther, which I believe we can, then it would be beautiful."

"Everyone on the team is always out there putting in the hard work," McWilliams said.  

"We have the best player in the conference in Ife. She's very unselfish and she never stops.  We could go as far as the second round of the NCAAs."

Headline: Confidence, consistency fuel Robinson
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Confidence.

Confidence is all that Taurean Robinson, better known to everyone as 
Tori, gives off.  However, with all the confidence Tori has in his abilities, there is an enormous façade of shyness that the confidence must break through. 

"Tori is a very quiet guy, he leads more by example, by working hard and being very attentive in meetings," Head Coach Don Strock said.


While shyness is inevitable with some people, confidence is not.  Why shouldn't Tori be confident?  While being part of a wishbone offense, meaning that there are three other backs in the backfield with him, he still managed to rush for 730 yards and seven touchdowns and help Southridge to a 10-2 record. If that's not enough, maybe its because he runs the 40-yard dash in 4.45 seconds, which is the norm for big time college and NFL athletes at Tori's position.  Robinson is a power runner that looks up to, and mimics, the running style of "The Bus," Jerome Bettis.  
"He's the perfect back for the type of offense that we run, he's a big back at 6-0 225lbs, has good speed, blocks well, and all that works well in a 
single back offense," Strock said. 

He also went on by saying that the future holds nothing but opportunity for Tori to succeed. 

Tori feels as if he has put himself in the best possible situation to succeed by choosing FIU over the likes of prominent college programs such as Rutgers, Indiana and Bowling Green.  

In addition to his successes on the football field, Robinson was also a member of Southridge's 4x100 record setting relay team.  He would go 
on to be named an all-county first team honoree in track his senior year.

Huge determining factors in his decision to attend FIU were family and friends and the opportunity to stay close to them.  Even though he lives on campus, he says it's easy for him to go home whenever he feels "homesick."  

Tori thinks the best part of his whole college experience isn't suiting up on autumn Saturday afternoons, but the chance to be on his own, as Tori put it, "be your own man."  

After leading the team in rushing last fall, Tori's goals were cut and dry for the short term: "run for 1,000 yards and to win now even though we're going to go through growing pains."

None of this can be sought without the hard work that Tori has put in. 

Offensive guard Ed Wenger said, "Tori is a great worker. He's pretty much a workhorse, he has really gained a lot of strength since last fall and has put in a lot of hard work."  

As far as the long term is concerned, Tori is hoping to set records that those who follow him in the program will have a hard time reaching.  

When asked what his football related goals after college would be, Tori smiles and shyly answers "to play in the NFL," just like he probably answered at age five when he started playing the game he loves for its physicality. 

"Just seeing the lavish lifestyles the players live," is another thing that fuels him besides his love for the game.  

Tori's formula for success is extremely simple, and that is to stay focused and put everything else that is not as important aside.  

While setting records and rushing for a thousand yards, Tori is shooting for a bachelor's degree in sports management, which he hopes to put towards a career as a sports agent.  

Graduating with a 3.5 is a must, and the Master's degree will be soon to follow, according to Tori.  

Running backs coach, Renato Diaz, also spoke volumes about Tori's personality and work ethic. "Tori Robinson is a wonderful young man, does everything you ask for and never procrastinates.  This is a huge benefit for the coaches because it gives us less worries."  

Robinson believes his attitude will translate into success in any facet of life, not just on the gridiron. It may be pounding the ball in at the goal line or gaining 30 yards on a screen pass into the flats. Or it may be helping his client net a big contract, graduating with honors, or walking up to the podium on draft day and shaking the commissioner's hand with team's hat in hand.  

"He is respectful and very coachable; the moment you teach him something, it will show up the next time he takes a repetition in practice.  As a coach you want as many of those guys as you can get," Diaz added.

Headline: Mitchell looks to make an impact
Author: Pete Pelegrin/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Most 13 year olds are into the latest video games, hanging out at a mall or discovering the opposite sex.

So it isn't everyday that you hear about a 13 year old who builds a circuit board in middle school.

FIU wide receiver Everett Mitchell, the Doogie Howser of engineering, did just that.

Mitchell, who was in the engineering program in a magnet middle school in Riviera Beach, Fla., was in class when he accomplished the unusual feat.

 "I was at a work station in class just messing around one day and through trial and error ended up building a circuit board," Mitchell, an electrical engineering major, said.  "It had an emergency hazard light and all the works.  I was kind of proud about it and the class looked up to me."

They aren't the only ones who look up to him. This fall FIU quarterbacks will as well. 

Mitchell, a graduate of Suncoast High School in Riviera Beach, will be the h-back/slot receiver for the Golden Panthers one-back offense. He will be counted on heavily to help move the chains and light up the scoreboard.

"Everett is a smart, smart football player, who runs good routes," head coach Don Strock said.  "You have to be quick to play the slot and he's just that, plus he's got good football instincts."

Part of the football instincts can be traced to two men. His father, who is also named Everett Mitchell, played college football at Lincoln (MO) University with Lamar Parrish, a former defensive back for the Washington Redskins.

Parrish was also the defensive backs coach at Suncoast High, Mitchell's alma mater.

"I owe a lot to both my father and Lamar Parrish," Mitchell, who was second last fall with 16 receptions, said.  "They both helped me out a lot, especially with breaking to the ball."

Mitchell was an offensive triple threat at Suncoast.  He caught 32 passes for 842 yards, rushed 45 times for 573 yards and even completed 19 of 36 passes for 653 yards.
He was named the Chargers MVP after the 1998-99 season.

He also played basketball four years, ran track two years and competed in power lifting two years.

All these athletic accomplishments did not go unnoticed. The University of Miami, Missouri and Eastern Kentucky, along with FIU, came calling for Mitchell.

At first, the choice was easy for Mitchell:  Go with the champs. However, the coaching change delivered a jolt of receiving energy.

"Miami was recruiting me hard, but then Butch Davis (former UM coach) left for the Cleveland Browns," Mitchell, who was being recruited as a defensive back/wide receiver, said.  "All the heavy UM recruiting stopped and I didn't want to go there anymore if Butch wasn't going to be there."

"After the Miami thing, FIU came knocking on the door and I knew where I was going," Mitchell added.

Even though Mitchell went from being a possible member of last season's No. 1 college football team to a first year player for a novice I-AA football team, he's glad he chose FIU.

"This is a nice, clean environment where everyone is excited for the first season," Mitchell said.  

"At the pep rally and around school, people come up to me and say 'you play football, all right! we're gonna be at the first game.'"

What FIU football fans will see at that first game is going to be a slot receiver with strength, speed (4.5 in the 40) and the ability to get open.

Mitchell has a knack for finding the end zone.  He scored twice in the second of the three spring scrimmages and had 152 yards receiving and a touchdown last fall.

He's eager to get going both on the football field and in the classroom at FIU.

The man dubbed "rocket scientist" by his best friend, Calvin Stuckey, a wide receiver at Eastern Arizona Community College, looks forward to a career in engineering; after all, it runs in the family.

"I look forward to owning my own engineering firm one day," Mitchell said.  

"My brother, Rohman Mitchell, is an engineer and I'd like to be one too, but also be the owner of the firm."

Mitchell also looks forward to owning some records.

"If I'm given the opportunity, I would like to lead the team in receptions, the nation and I-AA, and also yards after the catch," the ambitious Mitchell said.

"I'm ready to play my first college football game," Mitchell added. "It's a new school, first season, a chance to do something special."

Mitchell, who wore No. 1 in high school, will wear No. 2 at FIU, because he says he's "second to none."

"Coach Strock has given me this chance to show what I can do," Mitchell says.  "Wherever I'm at, I'll try to make something happen."

Whether it's middle school or the FIU Community Stadium, setting records or breaking them, Mitchell will connect a few wires or connect with a quarterback and either way, hope to make it happen.

Headline: Haritan, defensive player of year, becomes FIU safety
Author: Pete Pelegrin/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Sometimes you have to take one step back before you can take two steps forward.

Meet John Haritan.  A high school linebacker trapped inside an FIU strong safety's body.  

Haritan was all-everything at Longwood Lyman High in Casselberry, Fla. 

He was named the Orlando Sentinel's Seminole County Defensive Player of the Year. He also collected honors in the following categories: all-conference, all-county, Florida Athletic Coaches' Association all-district, All-Central Florida and honorable mention all-state.

Yet, when Haritan lines up this season for FIU, because of his size, it 
won't be as a linebacker, but rather as a strong safety, but that won't stop him from playing like a linebacker .

"I like to hit and I'll always have that linebacker mentality wherever I play," Haritan, who led the team with five tackles in the final spring game, said.  "It's been a little difficult at first, learning a new position, but when it's done I want to be the best safety in college football."

Despite the intricacies of the safety position, which along with middle linebacker could be equated as the quarterback of the defense, Haritan has learned to use his natural talents to adjust to his new position.

"I think my speed and lack of fear have helped in making the transition," Haritan said. 

"But I still need to fine tune my coverages.  Covering the pass is the toughest adjustment."

It's Haritan's aggressiveness and fearlessness that has also caused some trouble in the position switch.

"It's been a little difficult, because I'm too aggressive," Haritan, who also led the team in tackles last fall with 34 (20 solo), said.  "I've jumped at the run too quickly, that's the linebacker in me coming out."

Haritan is has the same type of fiery attitude.   

The linebacker mentality, aggressiveness and speed are what made Haritan stand out for head coach Don Strock.

"He was a tremendous athlete in high school who was a big hitter," Strock said.  "He's got good speed in the 4.5 range and good size for a safety (6'0, 195-200 lbs), plus he's put on 15 pounds of muscle."

The Golden Panthers have also taken notice of Haritan's size and speed.
"He's got the agility of a wide receiver," wide receiver Everett Mitchell said.  

"It's his instincts for the ball that help him out a lot.  There are not too many times you beat him to the ball."

At Lyman there weren't too many times anyone else beat Haritan either.

Besides football, Haritan also competed in wrestling, weightlifting and track. 

He finished undefeated as a senior heavyweight wrestler, finished his wrestling career with a 39-1 record and was voted Most Outstanding Heavyweight Wrestler in four tournaments.

But he has always loved football.

Haritan grew up rooting for the Dallas Cowboys and has always had football in his blood.

With the Lyman Greyhounds, he was as quick as a greyhound on the field, amassing 327 tackles his last two years and over 400 in his three-year high school career.

With numbers like that he drew attention from Big 12 power Colorado and Florida Atlantic, but chose FIU instead.

"FIU is all new, it's a great opportunity to set records, it's great," Haritan said.  

"The campus is beautiful, the people are friendly and I think they're excited about the upcoming season."

Haritan describes himself as a relaxing, get-away-from-it-all type of guy.  

To relax, he spends time playing Ultimate Fighting Championships on his PlayStation 2 and enjoys watching James Bond films and "anything with Arnold Schwarzenegger."

Ironically, it was Bond and Schwarzenegger, along with some of his friends' dads, who helped Haritan choose the career he would choose to master at FIU.

"I have always liked all the spy movies and the FBI is something I've been interested in my whole life," Haritan, a criminal justice major, said. 

"My friends' dads were with the DEA and they were good role models for me."

Haritan hopes to be a good role model for the first year defense.

"This first season is going to be a good learning experience," Haritan said.  "I hope to look back on something positive to make me a better person."

The coaching staff is looking for players to stand up and lead the novice program. Haritan believes he is what the coaches need. 

"I want to be a team leader who leads the team in tackles," Haritan added. 

"We're all working hard looking to prove ourselves.  We have to step up to the plate."

The Golden Panthers will begin their season on August 29th.

Headline: Confusion about future plagues arts editor
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
I clearly remember being a young man full of dreams and walking into the halls of FIU. 

Granted, the dreams were about other, presumably better, universities, but still, there was magic in the air, and the possibilities seemed endless.

Now, three years later, what's endless is my load of work, and those wonderful collegiate dreams have turned into nightmares. 

I'd figured that college would be the great crucible of my experience, providing answer after answer and clearing the road ahead for me. Instead, I have even more questions that I have permanently put aside for future process, and the future is about as clear as the foggy bottom of the beer I'm softly crying into.

Well, it hasn't gotten that bad, yet. What brings this depressingly honest column around? I've been talking to my friend in Washington D.C., who's one of those perverse over-achievers that excel at everything not out of any spiritual need to better the world through their work, but out of a need to annoy the heck out of everyone they come in contact with. 

A typical conversation with my friend goes like this:

Me: So, I'm working on my homework.

Friend: Yeah, I'm working on my thesis for the Department of Defense as well. President Bush might be coming by later to help me…

Me:  Ah, that's nice…

Friend: Yeah, but I have to brush him off quickly, because I've just discovered a new galaxy in the sky, and I must alert astronomers all over.  I have to be done by five because I'm being elected president of a South American country by then.

Me: Right.

Friend: Nothing to brag about: one of the little ones, but still, we must comply with the will of the masses. 

Perhaps one of the reasons I'm so bitter is because I have trouble believing that I'm a senior already. 

It's there in bright letters when I try to get my FIU football tickets at the website, staring me defiantly. "Class Standing: Senior." I feel like more a "Class Lying Down: Senior."

It's not like my life is a complete failure, but I'm frustrated by the inability to see clearly what lies ahead, to have a plan broken down into subdivisions that tell me what will happen in the next ten years, day by day. 

Some people do have this, (see my friend above, who can accurately predict what she will be doing on November 3, 2007 at 9 p.m., give or take an hour.)

I'm frustrated by my inability to control the future.

College has been loads of fun, don't get me wrong. But there's always that little nagging voice inside suggesting that the fun memory of college days won't help me much when I have to resort to baiting johns in a feeble attempt to feed my crack habit. I'm kidding. I would never do crack. Do you know how many germs you can get from sucking on a crack pipe?

I don't mean to depress all of you incoming freshmen. The best years of your life do lie ahead of you, but they'll slip by all too quickly, leaving you to face that illusory real world of endless demands and compromises. John Mayer may think there's "no such thing as the real world," but that's because he's a pop star: Reality's not one of their fortés. 

As for me, the real world is waiting right outside my door to kick my ass in worse than the FIU judo team. 

And on that cheery note, welcome to FIU.

Headline: Fall course offerings fail to provide sufficient upper division classes
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
The following column required exactly zero research whatsoever. 

It was written by sitting at my computer with the online interactive class schedule from sis.fiu.edu opened on my browser. 

If I tend to skew toward the English department, it's only because I am an English major. The overall message however, probably applies to all majors.

What is up with the university this semester? It was nearly impossible to find classes to take in the fall. There's next to nothing being offered for upper classmen. 

In fact, my options were so limited, I have to be on campus for twelve hours on Thursdays alone. 

And of the four classes I'm currently scheduled for, I have a sneaking suspicion that two are classes I've previously taken, but with different names. Admittedly, it's very possible that they're new classes, but what if they aren't? If that happens to be the case, I'm stuck rehashing the same material.

I think part of the problem is that our proud university seems to care only about our underclassmen and not the upperclassmen. It's a clever ploy too. After two years, reduce the number of classes available. 

That way, when they're scrounging at the bottom of the barrel, almost anything looks good. I think those really good classes with the awesome sounding names ("Studies In Love And Desire," anyone?) were never open to begin with. They're just put there, already closed, to make us think there's something good out there, and we just weren't lucky enough to get in.

I know we have a lot of incoming freshman, but am I the only one who thinks 87 "Freshman Experience" sections is a little excessive for a course that shouldn't be required in the first place? It's a class that teaches students how to be a student for crying out loud. 

I do feel kind of sorry for professors stuck teaching Freshman Experience though. In some cases, they have three Ph.D.s and were nominated for some U.S. grant for being one of the top minds in their field, and yet they have to sit there behind a desk, passing out activity sheets with questions like "Who is your SGA president?" and "Where is the comptroller's office?" Eventually, they turn into a university wide "Where's Waldo" book: "Can you find a man dressed like Genghis Khan?"

Unfortunately, Freshman Experience is mandatory, and we have to pay to take it. I can only hope that the money we spend on Freshman Experience classes goes towards something positive.

So here's the big question: what happens next semester? I know money is tight and professors are apparently dropping off the planet like flies, but next semester is supposed to be my final semester. 

I certainly hope that the number of classes available to me will increase, because honestly, I am not in the mood to scour between the hundreds of sections of "Essay Writing" and "Essay Writing (For Hospitality Students)" in a futile attempt to find something that will count as an early literature class.

Look, it's not that difficult a problem to solve. Don't make Freshman Experience a requirement. Drop those off the planet. Then, those freed up professors can go around teaching something else. Like perhaps the subject they were hired for being professors in. 

I know I would rather want to teach the subject I'm an expert in instead of making students memorize the difference between SOC, SPC, SGA and SIS. 

In addition, drop pathetic lower division classes like "Essay Writing," which actually don't count for anything and are there for the benefit of those who failed to grasp to English language in high school. 

Of course, before I can be a professor of anything, I need to get this stupid bachelor's degree thing out of the way, which all depends on whether or not the few upper-division classes I still have to take are offered.

Headline: Washington internship an interesting experience for student
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
The best summer of my life is over.  As I sit and think in retrospect, I realize all the things I learned during the past two months.  It all went by so fast that it is almost overwhelming to absorb everything at the same time. This summer 30 Hispanics from across the nation arrived at Washington, D.C. to work as congressional interns. I was one of those 30 individuals.

Before embarking on this journey, I had ambiguous feelings about the outcome of this experience.  I read the profiles of the other individuals selected and felt a little awkward when I discovered that most of them attended Ivy League schools.  

Right then, all expectations for having fun started to fade away.  "It can't be that bad," I mumbled to myself, in a weak attempt to be optimistic.  I thought that after all, I might have something in common with people who practice rowing and dress like Carlton from "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." 

Anyway, my social life would have to come in second and I would just have to concentrate on working for the next two months.

The situation only worsened when I received a letter with the recommended dress-code guidelines for congressional placements.  My eyes popped out as I read the words "Must Wear Pantyhose"– those horrible tight things that cut the circulation off your legs and feel like a torture device.  

I was so cranky that when the saleswoman at Express thanked me for shopping there and handed me the bag full of pantyhose and smiled, I fantasized about throwing the change back in her face. I also had to put up with everybody giving me hour long, paranoia-filled lectures that range from what to do in case there was a terrorist attack to how to handle dirty politicians who might want to get me in bed. Nevertheless my main preoccupation remained intact.  I feared that I would have to pretend to be someone else in order to fit in the Capitol Hill environment.

And so this mood darkened the first part of my journey, but little did I know that life was about to teach me a lesson.

Once I arrived in D.C., I began to see all my preconceptions contradicted one by one. All those Ivy League students actually came from very poor backgrounds, and like me, they relied on their achievements and dedication, not on their incomes.  

I didn't find any rowers or golfers, but I did find some of the best salsa dancers I have ever seen in my life.  And it was with these same people that I built a bond that carries the same weight of family ties.

Upon arriving at the Rayburn House Building, the elegance of the marble intimidated me.  Before walking through the doors, I promised myself that I would remain myself under all circumstances.  And I did. The people in my office were very nice and down to earth, including the Congressman. Contrary to the public's view that politics is just a dirty game for power freaks, I learned that although this might be true for some people, politics is more about public service and compromising. I learned that you can't get anywhere on your own because even the greatest leaders needed followers.  One must learn how to compromise enough to gain support for the causes that you believe in, but not so much that you corrupt the integrity of those causes.  This truly is an art and a skill.  

I witnessed former Ohio Congressman James Traficant's expulsion from Congress for embezzlement. I realized that there is still hope for a just political system. I witnessed Jews and Arabs come together and struggle to build a bilateral coalition to assess the human rights situation in the refugee camps.  I realized that there is still hope for peace. I saw the growing presence of Latinos on Capitol Hill – educated Latinos unashamed to be bilingual, proud of their heritage and roots. I realized that there is still hope for the Latino community.

After the first week in Congress, I realized that the women wore pantyhose so that they wouldn't have to shave their legs.  Therefore, I decided that I would break the rules and not wear panty hoes. 

After all, I had to stick to my own individuality. As I walked down Independence Avenue on my last day of work, I watched the white Capitol building rise against the blue sky.  

I thought about my theory that the United States was the modern-day Roman Empire. I looked at the building once again and smiled knowing that all my efforts had allowed me, in some small way, to be part of it.

Winners

FIU Judo: After years of practicing those moves on each other, you got to use them in the real world by stopping a rather unlucky carjacker.  And hey, if you ever need any coverage, let us know.  We love judo!  Just please don't hurt us.  

College of Law:  It took a good deal of effort, but this semester the FIU law program has officially begun.  Congratulations to the college for offering a more affordable alterative to University of Miami and helping FIU make a name for itself through academics.  

Golden Panther Football: Congratulations on your inaugural game. It's nice to see all our efforts to bring football to FIU have finally come into fruition. Hopefully this will do something to fix our rampant lack of school spirit.

Losers

Unlucky Carjacker:  So how unlucky do you have you to be to provoke a Judo instructor and his students?  With your luck, prison's probably safer; next time you'll probably try to mug a group of Section-8 navy seals. 

FIU tuition increase:   So what can be worse than a 20 percent tuition increase? FIU adding insult to injury by offering  international students a loan funded by the 20 percent tuition hike itself! If that sounds confusing, you're not alone.  It makes no sense to us either.

Jeb Bush: Making a man who once endorsed spanking to the point of leaving bruises and welts the head of DCF was a bad move so close to re-election. At this point, just hope that many Floridians fail to properly punch in votes again.

Headline: Students, parents should embrace exposure to new ideas
Author: Linda P. Campbell/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
One word to parents who may be sending their youngsters off to college: "ideas."

They're lurking everywhere.

Children may be introduced to ideas at unexpected moments, from unforeseen sources. These ideas may be exotic, unvarnished, disturbing, comforting, unexpected, enticing, repugnant, confounding, even outlandish.

And that's just the ones passed about by their friends.

If parents are getting their money's worth, school will challenge their kids to defend their opinions, explain their beliefs, contrast ideas both familiar and foreign.

In other words, to think. To grow _ emotionally, intellectually and socially. To prepare to meet, greet and engage in the process of being a contributing member of society.

That's a university's job.

But it apparently scares some folks so silly that they'll sue to prevent a school from doing it.

Thus comes James Yacovelli, et al. v. James Moeser, et al., in which lawyers from the American Family Association Center for Law & Policy claim that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is "indoctrinating students in the religion of Islam" by assigning incoming freshmen to read, write about and discuss a book on the Koran.

The UNC summer reading program requires new undergraduates each year to read a specified book, write a one-page response to it and take part in two-hour noncredit seminars, which have been scheduled for next week.

This year, the featured text is "Approaching the Koran: The Early Revelations" by Michael Sells, a comparative religion professor. The book was chosen for its current relevance – and, judging from the explanation and discussion questions on the UNC Web site, not as a brainwashing tool.

The study questions include the following:

"How important are images, metaphors, symbols and figures of speech in the language of the Koran;"

The guidelines apparently were amended after some complaints to allow students with religious objections to reading parts of the Koran to write a paper explaining why they chose not to read the book.

But if you believe the claims of the lawsuit and politically conservative pontificators who have been ranting about the assignment that the university is not only promoting an "enemy" religion at public expense but also violating students' right to exercise their own religions as they choose.

Forget that the university isn't taking a stand on the merits of Islam, insisting that students embrace it or suggesting that anyone convert. Forget that the university might actually be trying to stimulate inquiry, promote education about a culture unknown to many Americans, engage in the exchange of ideas or promote expression, reasoning, understanding and reflection.

In other words, UNC is performing exactly the function that students, their parents and taxpayers of the state expect.

Of course, educators must watch for land mines when undertaking instruction involving religion because it is such a personal and volatile topic.

Sensitivity, respect and an air of openness to dissenting views all are vital to the mix. So is a realization that some closed minds will stay forever shut.

But dialogue about religion in a university setting shouldn't and needn't amount to indoctrination. College students are mature enough to study religions for their cultural significance, their contribution to social and political structures, their impact on history. A course on the Bible as literature no more requires personal endorsement of its content than a survey class on American authors requires enthusiastic immersion in Conradiana.

Those who treat exposure to uncomfortable ideas like an encounter with a flasher – not only offensive but dangerous – miss the very essence of academic freedom. Higher education fails in its mission if it doesn't help students learn to think and analyze, weigh others' ideas and examine their own.

Arming the next generation of adults with the ability to sort through a multitude of ideas and make informed decisions about what to keep and what to reject will prepare them for citizenship and enable them to better understand and defend American values.

There's nothing blissful about ignorance – and it's foolish to impede the pursuit of knowledge.

Headline: In Our View:  Students deserve more forewarning of tuition increase
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
This summer, as most students probably already know, the FIU Board of Trustees has decided to raise tuition to the highest amounts allowed by state law.  The increase will ultimately result in a 20 percent increase in tuition for non-resident students, a 10 percent increase for resident graduate students and a 5 percent increase for in-state undergraduates.  

While this may not seem like much to some students fortunate enough to have received scholarships, many students have felt the effects, which does amount to hundreds more than they would normally have to pay in the case of non-resident graduates and undergraduates hit hardest by a 20% increase.  

Although tuition increases are a common headache for students in most major universities at some point, the main concern with FIU's tuition hike is simply the timing.  When the university decided to implement these increases, they simply should have given students ample warning.  

If that would have been the case, many students would have had more time to adjust their budgets accordingly and the increase might have gone over more smoothly.

The university could have, for instance, informed the students via the email system or perhaps deferred the implementation of the increase until the spring, giving students a fair amount of time to adjust.  

If postponing the increase a few months was not a feasible option,  the university still had plenty of time to inform students between June 17, the date on which the decision was reached, and registration.  A month of warning might have given many students time to make necessary arrangements.  

Perhaps in the future it would help if the university, upon making decisions like these, begins to see its students not as a money-making mass, but as individuals who need work, save and in many cases, make significant sacrifices to attend this university and pay for their classes each semester, as well as the ridiculously overpriced textbooks they must also purchase.  

Of course, the legitimacy of the tuition increase is not in question here and the extra funds are most likely required in order to, hopefully, resolve certain concerns that came as a result of the now notorious budget cuts FIU has experienced.  

The university has every right to raise tuition within the guidelines set by the state legislature and within reason if it feels such an increase is necessary.  

But the fact of the matter is, students also have every right to be informed of decisions like these that effect them in many ways and can seriously jeopardize their ability to attend the university and pay for classes on time if not given ample warning.

Headline: Commentary: FIU FAQ
Subheadline: Everything you always wanted to know about FIU (but were afraid to ask)
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Q: What's with all the initials on campus? Is there anyone who doesn't speak in acronyms?
A: Acronyms are there to make life easier. For example, instead of saying "Graham Center," which is three syllables, you just say "GC," which is two. That saves you a lot of spit, don't it? The same goes for Biscayne Bay Campus (BBC). Instead of saying Wolfe University Center, you can just say WUC. U C? It makes things EZ.

Q: What about all the foreign language stuff all over the campus?
A: Those are called international students. Please don't be rude.

Q: No, I mean on the buildings.
A: Those are called international graffiti tags. Los Locos rules!

Q: I'm talking about the names of buildings. What's that all about?
A: Oh that! Well, to reflect our international diversity, a bunch of our early buildings were given names in different languages to incorporate different cultures. They  are: Primera Casa ("First House" in Spanish), Deuxieme Maison ("Second House" in French), Owa Ehan ("Third House" in Swahili) and Viertes Haus ("Fourth House" in German). But to make things easy, just use that acronym system we mentioned earlier: PC, DM, OE and VH.

Q: I thought Primera Casa was the Charles E. Perry Building.
A: It is. It was also named after the founder and first President of FIU, Charles E. Perry.

Q: So is it PC for Primera Casa or CP for Charles Perry?
A: It's PC. CP is Chemistry and Physics, that funny little building where they teach Chemistry or ENC 1102.

Q: The other day, when I wasn't paying attention, I got on a bus to go to BBC and I wound up in Sweetwater at some weird building. Was I in the Twilight Zone?
A: Close. You were on our Engineering campus, a strange little  off-shoot where thousands of students congregate for one solitary purpose: improving the buzz-saws on their latest BattleBot.

Q: What does the new meal plan consist of?
A: Honey buns and Vanilla Coke.

Q: What do I do if I want to eat a meal on campus?
A: There are several places on campus that sell food, including chains like Pollo Tropical, Pizza Hut, Burger King and Subway. There are also a few safe eating establishments off campus.

Q: This is crazy. A whopper on campus costs like four dollars more than it does at Burger King across the street! That's just insane.
A: That's not a question.

Q: What should I do if I have a big essay due in 10 hours and I've yet to start it?
A: Find religion.

Q: I've already found religion and He isn't helping me write this damn thing. Now what?
A: Find "Courier New."

Q: I still have to write it. Big fonts don't help.
A: Sometimes, the best thing you can do is have a good light snack and just slowly string out your thoughts on paper until you get the ball rolling. When you're done, say to yourself "next time, I get this done early" and laugh at the funny joke you just made.

Q: What would you consider a good light snack?
A: Honey buns and Vanilla Coke.

Q: What's the big deal with FIU Football?
A: Almost 30 years after our inception as a university, we'll be having our first game ever this Thursday. It's a grand and momentous moment in the FIU timeline. Think of it as a university pube: A sign of adulthood and maturity.

Q: Wow. The new, improved bookstore is really incredible. It's like a Barnes and Noble in there. What's your favorite new feature about it?
A: "The Killer Bean 2," a short film on the plasma TV.

Q: What's with the big rocks everywhere?
A: That's construction.

Q: No, the ones with plaques in front of them on the sidewalks.
A: That's art.

Q: That's art?
A: Yes, very expensive outdoors art. Kind of like that giant cement Virgin Mary in a Latin front lawn, only these are much more expensive and about 85 percent of them are vaguely about sex. Please don't touch them.

Q: What about the one called "Man?"
A: You may touch that one only if you're confident of your sexuality.

Q: What does the big, spinning cube mean?
A: It means your Gamecube is turned on. Just kidding. Actually, this popular hunk of metal has kind of a mythic quality about it. Legend has it that if you spin it right before a test, it's guaranteed to help you get a better grade. The line to spin the cube on final's week is often larger than the one to sell back books.

Q: Can I jump on the seal?
A: Yes, but the seal will fight back.

Headline: Dirty Vegas cleaner, duller than expected
Author: Monica Gonzalez
&nbsp;
In their self-titled debut, the members of Dirty Vegas blend club-hopping trance grooves with guitar strums and laid back vocals. The possibilities of this unique blend dimly shine through some of the tracks, but most of the album is placid and uninteresting. The whole thing feels like one long car ride: I can imagine myself seated in the passenger's seat with my forehead stuck to the window, staring at the unchanging scenery while this album, or any other like it, hums in the background. 

The members of this group try to combine the catchiest elements of today's pop music scene, melding monotonous dance beats with rock-a-bye guitars and lyrics. The trio consists of Steve Smith, Ben Harris and Paul Harris (no relation). Smith gives us his voice and a solid sense of percussion and rhythm. 

Ben Harris has a predominantly rock-based background. Regularly spinning at London's Ministry of Sound by the time he was seventeen years old, Paul Harris brings in years of experience from the club scene.  

 "I Should Know" opens the album. Stylistic trance percussion keeps your head unconsciously nodding while Smith carefully weaves a flamenco-style guitar into the breaking points of the song. But when the vocalist begins with: "I'll show you things that you've never seen," I cannot help but think how misleading that statement is.  

"Days Go By" is, without question, the star track of the album. Brazilian backbeats and swooshing psychedelic swirls add a good deal of richness to it. Unless you have spent the last few months in an underwater cave, you've probably heard it enough times to find yourself singing along to it. 

To cue in the uninformed, "Days Go By" is the hit single that won popularity almost overnight when Mitsubishi featured it in a car commercial, and it has been making ripples on the airwaves ever since. An acoustic version of the song can be found in a hidden track at the end of the album, and it's just as tasty as the original.

When I heard "All or Nothing," the strange familiarity of Smith's voice and style suddenly became clear.  Is this soulful vocalist just another Bryan Adams backing himself up with a Brit-pop band in a vain attempt to appeal to a younger, hipper audience? Scary, but the bland lyrics and unchallenging melody left me with that sneaking suspicion.

Overall, Dirty Vegas is not at all dirty, and aside from the cheesy '70s art in the liner notes (I can't keep from mentioning that the liner notes are just portraits of porn star types), the band's debut album hardly brings to mind images of Las Vegas.  

The album does not boast notable breakthroughs, but offers a smooth and palatable blend of today's choice pop flavors.

Headline: Warped Tour scorches through Florida
Author: John Lovell/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Of all the important dates throughout the year, there is one very special day every indie-music-scene kid looks forward to. Each summer, the Vans Warped Tour embarks on a three-month trip across America with an armada of over fifty bands (losing and gaining some along the way) and a roster of respectable skaters and stunt-devils. 

The 2002 edition of Vans' edgy Warped Tour attracted an enormous crowd, from all over South Florida, to the Pompano Beach Amphitheatre. The masses gathered to be moved, literally, by the sounds of their favorite progressive rock bands ripping through the air in all directions.

Two main stages showcasing the talents of bands such as Something Corporate, NOFX, Bad Religion, Reel Big Fish, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Thursday, New Found Glory, Ozma, MxPx and the Alkaline Trio rotated between half-hour set lists (one band set up on stage-A while one band rocked on stage-B). In addition, four smaller stage areas, such as the Drive-Thru Records and Volcrom stages, brought acts like the Rx Bandits, the Starting Line, Five Iron Frenzy, Shai Hulud, Pepper and Finch.

Attending this festival can be a bit of a trial. An intelligent Warped Tour attendee plans out his day by deciding which bands to see and when. The task of finding a nice spot amidst a massive crowd watching any given band is not an easy one. 

You might have to sacrifice the sets of other bands in order to save a space before an area becomes too crowded.  And you might get tired of pushing and shoving through the swarms of hot and sweaty fans, a various number of merchandise tents, rest areas and other attractions like skate and stunt ramps. But honestly – who could ever get sick of being packed like a sardine?

This year, the Warped Tour seemed to have recruited the efforts of bands generally classified in the sophisticated progressive rock genre. For example, New Found Glory and Something Corporate go along nicely with the latest music trend: "emo," the sappy lifestyle of vinyl, vintage clothing, underground  music and look-like-skeleton diets which many teenagers emulate lately. 

Of course, the Warped Tour brought along its promised punk, ska and hardcore bands as well, yet I got the feeling Vans is trying to support this new and upcoming music trend.

My two favorite highlights of the entire festival were the performances of New Jersey's Thursday and of California's progressive ska/reggae group, Rx Bandits. Thursday jolted an audience in front of one of the main stages with their mix of hardcore screams that complement a softer-spoken lead singer. Fresh with their single "Understanding in a Car Crash," they delivered a performance which reached all possible levels of endorphin excitement.  

Playing on the smaller, Drive-Thru Records stage, the Rx Bandits also came through with a stellar performance. This group blends together many different styles of music and does it with a perfect grace, which is as stylish as it is beautiful.  A duet of trombone and saxophone combine with a synthesizer to complement powerful rock and reggae grooves. The end result is so amazing that it should simply be experienced instead of described.

The Vans Warped Tour has a reputation of showcasing bands that move on to become big-time national acts, like Blink-182 and Green Day. 

Some of the bands definitely displayed this potential, but only time will tell where they end up. In the mean time, we can rest assured that next summer the tour will return with an equally impressive list of bands.  It should be interesting to see how commercialized  indie  rock will be by then.

Headline: Rock your way back to school
Author: John Lovell/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"Back to school, back to school, to prove to Dad I'm not a fool." Those eternal words sung by Adam Sandler in the comedy classic "Billy Madison" ring louder than ever. It's fall, it's the first day of class and we're all in the same boat. We're here to spend our parents' (or our government's) hard earned money on some sort of semi-dazed attempt to attend college and educate ourselves.  This is the beginning of the rest of our adult lives. The doorway to tomorrow. We should be excited about all this, right? Yes, I'm about as excited as a cow in a slaughterhouse. My sleep is haunted by visions of last-minute cramming sessions at 4 a.m., 12 pages of final paper mayhem and that pesky Senator Gordon cackling "C or better."

There's only one thing I can think of to help me cope with the insanity of back-to-school fever. No, it's not beer; it's rock-and-roll, baby!  There's nothing like a few rockin' tunes to kick back with and listen to, in an effort to help ease the pain and take me somewhere else for a few minutes. I guarantee it will do wonders for you and I've even prepared a list of songs perfect for this occasion. Behold, the almighty, top 10 back-to-school rock songs! Since I'm almost positive there's plenty of stress going around, I'm suggesting everyone listen to the following 10 songs. Got "Kazaa"? 

I'm sure most of you remember the mockumentary "This Is Spinal Tap" about England's loudest metal group, Spinal Tap. I feel that their song "Bitch School" accents back-to-school time quite nicely. Even though this is a song about female dog obedience training, we can all relate. It's a funny song, with plenty of beautiful '80s metal, that offers some consolation for having to attend class again. Hey, even dogs have to go to school. 

Next in line are punk-rock legends The Ramones. Everybody's favorite skinny punk, Joey Ramone, knows what going to school is really all about in "Rock and Roll High School." "I just wanna have some kicks, I just wanna get some chicks" is a slogan that I'm sure is on everyone's mind. Who needs "edumacation?" When does the party start? 

The next song is more modern, Ben Folds Five's careless anthem, "Battle of Who Could Care Less." Although this song may not necessarily apply to actual school, it's a fair description of typical college kids, or at least what many of us strive to be. The illustrious lazy and lethargic, "whatever" lifestyle has been proven to be a healthy indulgence, but it's just not practical. However, in the case of dealing with getting back into a responsible routine, it's much easier to follow Ben Folds' description. Who cares?

Remember in high school all those girls who would die before giving up their army of 100 friends, the captain of the football team and the frail hearts of all the lowly nerds and geeks?  

There's one word for this, and it can be found in the next song on the countdown: "Popular" by Nada Surf. These one-hit-wonders really hit the mark with their catchy tune. The really sad part is that these kinds of people still exist, even at the university level. "Popular" is the perfect party favor this year for FIU's inaugural football season.

Keeping our minds set in the blur of education before college, the next song takes us into the realm of school lunches: "Pizza Day" by The Aquabats!, the ska band which once harbored Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, is an ode to public school cafeteria lunch days. "Pizza Day" waxes nostalgic for the beauty of leaving one's daily school meal to a pre-made lunch schedule.  Even though college cafeterias have evolved to chain restaurants and gourmet cooking, Friday will always be pizza day, the best day of the week.

With that in mind, The Cure takes the next spot with "Friday, I'm In Love," the best song to describe the way it feels to wake up on a Friday morning and soak in the beauty of a school-less weekend. During a hectic school week, there's nothing students look forward to more than Friday, especially if they don't have class that day. This is one of the greatest end-of-the-week songs ever and it works perfectly in this case.

Be cautious when listening to "Knowledge" by the punk/ska pioneer, Operation Ivy. Its catch phrase "All I know is that I don't know" is all too true for so many of us.  We think we know so much about life, when really we know little or nothing at all. We go to school for about 20 years because it's expected and what we're supposed to do. "Knowledge" simply asks if we're actually learning anything meaningful.

Changing the pace is Van Halen's sparky "Hot For Teacher." Did you ever have a professor or maybe a teaching assistant who was a total fox? Did they ever offer extra credit? You know what I'm talking about. This track hopes for a schedule with a hands-on anatomy class, taught by the hottest instructor one could ever imagine. A very creative way to get your mind out of the doldrums of educational boredom.

Next is one of my all time favorite songs. "The Good Life," by geek-rock gurus Weezer, is a cry for self-improvement. Trust me, you'll need it in times when your only motivation is to munch on Doritos all day. "The Good Life" is probably the most encouraging song on this countdown, so sing along with fist in the air, ready to go out and whoop some ass or at least do better on your next test.

Last but not least is the number one, back-to-school rock song. Paul Simon's "Me and Julio Down by the School Yard" is one of those runaway songs that takes you on a journey with an unknown destination. We're all on our way and none of us really have any idea where we're going. Right now, it beats knowing I have to go to Biscayne Bay Campus twice a week for night class, doesn't it?

There you have it. Ten songs to take away the chaos and dismay of the first week back. Go out, download these songs and burn yourself a mix CD. Whenever school has got you down on your spirits, pop it in the CD player, kick back and remember that even rock stars can get the school blues. You are not alone.

Headline: "Good Girl" not bad
Author: Lisa Cawley
&nbsp;
The sense of realism lacking in most of Jennifer Aniston's previous work is finally present in "The Good Girl." Aniston plays Justine Last, (get it?), a 30 year-old woman who hates everything about her monotonous, no-frills life, from her job at the local Retail Rodeo (think Kmart, only smaller) to her seven year marriage to a pot smoking, house painting, slow-witted, unattractive loser.  

Justine befriends a new 22 year-old cashier and aspiring writer (Jake Gyllenhaal), who calls himself Holden – after the main character in "The Catcher In The Rye." Holden and Justine identify with one another. They both hate the world and feel as though they've spent their entire lives "never getting got." Their friendship soon charges head-on into a turbulent affair filled with rendezvous at a nearby motel and in the storeroom at the Rodeo.   

There are no fancy cars or other signs of Hollywood idealism to glamorize the idea of an affair. The decisions that Justine faces are real.  She battles with the question "should I stay or should I go?" She's torn between her desire to be a "good girl" and her yearning for an escape from her stale marriage and unfulfilling life. Holden tries to persuade her to leave town with him, abandoning her life and fully committing herself to him. When she starts making excuses in indecision, Holden becomes obsessive, and the dark, psychotic shades of his personality begin to shine through. Justine then realizes that the man she thought would be her last chance at true happiness is "at best a child and at worst a demon."

She is forced to make a choice between her stable monotonous life and the exciting adventure she envisions her life could be. Stripped of her usual trendy clothes and flawless hair and make-up, Aniston is able to shed her "Rachel" persona almost entirely. Through her facial expressions, attitude and even the way she carries herself, she perfectly captures the essence of her character. 

The other actors are alsoe well cast. John C. Reilly, who plays Phil, Justine's husband, has no problem dumbing-down his personality to fit his role.  He plays the pathetic husband who spends his days painting houses and his nights sitting on his couch in paint-stained clothes, smoking weed and staring blankly at the television with his equally pathetic best friend Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson).    

But other than Aniston's, the most notable character is Gyllenhaal; he is magnificent as the troubled, young lover. The conflict screenwriter Mike White has written into nearly all of the characters in the film is magnified by Gyllenhaal's performance. One minute he seems lovable, with eagerness in his eyes and innocence in his smile; but the next minute, you want to leave him far behind, as he becomes intensely temperamental and morbidly infatuated. Holden is constantly trying to escape his life by attaching himself to Justine. He begs her to go with him to the motel, give him rides home from work, and ultimately, to run away with him.

"The Good Girl" does have some bad points. Justine is the only sufficiently developed character. We do not know much about Holden's life other than the fact that he hates it, and for the most part we are left in the dark about what Phil thinks. 

A downfall of the film that cannot be as easily justified is its slow pace. Director Miguel Arteta apparently wanted to keep the film as realistic as possible. Consequently, he does not employ any fancy camera tricks or upbeat, catchy songs to keep our attention.

All of this results in a realistically boring view of Justine's life. It isn't necessary to make a movie drag so that the audience will recognize how dull the character's life really is. He makes a 90-minute film seem like two hours, which, in this case, is not a good thing.

All in all, "The Good Girl" is realistic in an unrealistic way. Justine's struggle is familiar to those who've faced the complications that come with extramarital affairs. 

However, the implausible elements annoy you. For example, it's hard to believe that someone like Justine would marry someone like Phil in the first place. Also, after everything that happens, would she seriously consider leaving her husband for someone who's essentially a severely disturbed kid?  Probably not.

If you prefer to watch flashy, fast-paced flicks with a lot of action, don't bother to waste your time seeing "The Good Girl" because you will probably have a hard time keeping your eyes open.  On the other hand, if you want to see a well-acted film, then definitely check this one out.
