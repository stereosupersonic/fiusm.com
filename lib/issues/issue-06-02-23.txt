Headline: No. 25-ranked tennis team earns split
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The women of FIU's tennis team received a Valentine four years in the making on Feb. 14: a spot in the top-25 of the ITA national rankings.

"We're actually very excited," said junior Paula Zabala. "We're going to go to the NCAAs for sure but if we break the top-10 it would be really nice for the team and for the school."

No. 25 FIU solidified its standing among America's elite tennis teams with a 6-1 rout of Central Florida Feb. 17, before narrowly falling to undefeated North Carolina State two days later.

The Golden Panthers (3-2) play Alabama-Birmingham and Florida State on the road this weekend.



FIU 6, UCF 1



FIU clinched a hotly contested doubles point en route to five singles victories against Central Florida (3-4). 

The 24th-ranked team of Zabala and Nikkita Fountain defeated UCF's Pamela Fernandez and Anna Yakimchenkova, 8-3. 

But the Golden Knights won the No. 2 doubles match, leaving the doubles point in the hands of FIU's Shilla D'Armas and Marijana Cutuk, and UCF's Kenza Belbacha and Elvira Serrot. 

D'Armas served for the match at 7-6, 40-30 when Belbacha blasted a shot at Cutuk's feet. The sophomore used lightning-fast reflexes to dig the ball off the ground, shocking Balbacha who netted her next shot to give FIU the 8-6 win and the doubles point.

"After 1-1 in doubles, our match counted so we were like, 'we have to pick up and finish it off,'" said Cutuk.

The Croatian had Belbacha's number in singles as well, running her around the court with a full repertoire of winners. 

Cutuk hit a crosscourt backhand to clinch the first set, a drop shot to earn the first break of the second set and two inside-out forehands to seal the 6-0, 6-1 win at No. 4 singles.

Zabala got the best of Fernandez at No. 1 singles. Holding a game point at 4-4, Fernandez pounded three consecutive crosscourt backhands but a scrambling Zabala retrieved each one with her non-dominant left hand, drawing the error from Fernandez. 

"At that point, I just put my left hand and I was like, 'Come on, just do it, fight every point,'" said Zabala, who went on to break Fernandez's serve and spirit in a 6-4, 6-1 win.

D'Armas, Fountain and Courtney Jonson rounded out FIU's domination with singles victories. 

Jonson's opponent Jennifer Carati slammed her racket on the court and whacked tennis balls at the fence, frustrated with the Golden Panthers' ability to track down her best shots.

"I will run [until] I die on the tennis court: that's my philosophy," said Jonson. "Run down as many balls as I can, make them play one extra ball every time."



NC St. 4, FIU 3



The Golden Panthers led 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 in matches, but could not withstand the charge of North Carolina State (8-0). 

"Today was one of our tougher matches for the season but we just have to learn to hang tough," said Fountain, who whipped passing shots from all angles in her and Zabala's 8-3 No. 1 doubles victory. 

After FIU clinched the doubles point, Zabala won her fourth singles match in her last five outings.

Serving at 5-4 against 90th-ranked Barbara Orlay, Zabala lost three set points but kept her nerve and cracked a crosscourt backhand winner to take the first set.

The Zabala/Orlay match provided fans with a tennis rarity: opponents who both play with two-handed backhands and forehands. Zabala won 6-4, 6-4.

"I've played people like that before," said Zabala, a member of the All-Time Sun Belt Conference team. "Usually people who are two-handed, they have different games, but it wasn't that bad. I felt comfortable."

Fountain provided FIU with its third point, rallying for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over NC State's Nandita Chandrasekar at No. 3 singles. Known for her power, Fountain surprised Chandrasekar with timely drop shots late in the match.

"She was a little tired and I think it was in my best interest to make her move a little bit more," Fountain said. "So I found a way to do that and it really helped."

NC State came away with victories at No. 4, No. 5 and No. 6 singles, leaving D'Armas and Shona Lee to fight for the decisive point. 

Down 0-3 in the third set, D'Armas began to step inside the court and punish her strokes, rallying to 3-all. But Lee steadied herself and took the final three games, giving NC State a hard fought win over FIU. 

D'Armas, filling in for the injured Egle Petrauskaite at No. 2 singles, has proven worthy of the tougher competition.

"She's actually taken a step forward this year with her fitness," said Assistant Coach Carlos Casely. "It's really shown because she's been able to pull out some three-set matches more often than she used to. We're very happy with her."

Headline: Men's team loses despite late surge
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The final home game of the season for the men's basketball team did not go quite as planned. 

FIU scored just 11 points in the first period, tying a program-low for points in a half and, despite a late surge, fell in its final home contest of the year. 

FIU (8-17, 4-8) still had a glimmer of hope in climbing out of the East Division cellar, however, visiting South Alabama (19-6, 10-3) needed a win in order to claim the West Division Championship and the latter occurred as the Jaguars left Pharmed Arena Feb. 20 with a 64-51 victory. 

For the Golden Panthers, there was not too many words that could have described the first 20 minutes of play as they scored just 11 points while turning the ball over 17 times and shooting 5-of- 18 from the field and 1-of-9 from behind the 3-point arc.  

Ivan Almonte led all scorers with 17 points while only playing 24 minutes following a disagreement with head coach Sergio Rouco. 

"It was about playing time," Rouco said, after the game. "I just thought that he didn't start with the same focus he usually does. He had two or three turnovers in a row and I don't need that from my team leader. I need him to come in and calm the storm." 

Almonte was benched just four minutes into the first half after having a verbal disagreement concerning playing time with Rouco. The team suffered through his absence and trailed 27-11 in part because of poor shooting by USA. 

"It happens in the best of families and [it was a] misunderstanding between me and Ivan," Rouco said. "We aired it out at halftime and he came back and played a whale of a second half. Ivan is as emotional as I am, I guess it's our Latin blood; we are both very emotional. It was a misunderstanding on both our parts. I said something, he took it the wrong way and I took something he said the wrong way."

With Almonte absent, South Alabama took control of the game and finished the first half, over 15:30, on a 23-9 run. 

"The key to basketball is having your best player on the court," Rouco said. "When your best player isn't on the court, all the other guys are looking toward the bench to sub him back in and they stop playing. They went on a 16-0 run but sometimes you have to take a step back to take a step forward."

With Almonte working as the field general and inspired to prove the coaching staff wrong, the Golden Panthers fought their way back into contention bring the game to within four points at 41-37 with 7:28 to play. 

"We were as prepared as we have always been," said Rouco. "But we just didn't come out with the same fire as we did against Troy. We have had a hard time winning two home games in a row this year; I don't know what to attribute that to." 

That was as close as they would get as the Jaguars used their experience and superior free throw shooting to seal the victory. 

Johwen Villegas joined Almonte as the only Golden Panthers in double figures with 10 points on a horrific shooting night. The first-year man shot 2-of-12 from the field, including a lowly two-of-nine from behind the arc.    

Elvis Lora's consistent scoring output came to an end as the freshman was held to just three field goals 10 attempts, most of which came in the first half and he finished the night with seven points. 

The Jaguars were led by three scorers in double figures. Mario Jointer Demetric Bennett led the way with 14 and 13 points respectively, while Carlos Smith added 110. 

During the 11 point first half, the Golden Panthers were so out of control that they failed to even run plays offensively, simply trying to beat their opponents one-on-one every time down the floor. This proved easy pickings for a solid South Alabama team that could have walked away with a comfortable 30 point lead at the break. 

USA, at one point in the second half, led by as much as 20 points - fueled by 22 points off turnovers and 27 points off the bench. 



FIU 71, TROY 68



It took a career-night from FIU's captain but the job got done. 

Almonte once again put his demons to rest as he proved that he is back to full strength two weeks before the start of the conference tournament. 

The Dominican-born forward poured in a career-high 30 points along with 14 rebounds to record his new school-record 14th double-double of the season as FIU (8-16, 4-7) outpaced visitors Troy (12-13, 5-8) 71-68 Feb. 18 at Pharmed Arena. 

Elvis Lora, back from missing over a week of action, poured in 12 points off the bench to give the Golden Panthers their fifth win in their last eight contests. 

Rouco's defense was again proved to be the difference as Troy standout Bobby Dixon, who, coming in, ranked second in the Sun Belt in scoring at 18.7 points per game, was held to just 10 points during an aggravating night that saw him shoot four of nine from the field and turn the ball over five times. 

"We stayed with our game plan and did a good job of limiting Dixon to only 10 points with some great defense by Ismael N'Diaye and Chris Fuller," Rouco said. 

Sammy Sharp led the visitors with a career-high 24 points as the Trojans dropped their second consecutive conference outing. 

Coming in FIU had lacked solid play from their point guards and that had brought questions as to how far this team could go come March. 

Alan Guyton put some of that talk to rest for at least another night as he dished out six assists. 

"Our guards also did an outstanding job," Rouco said. "Alan Guyton controlled [the] tempo and for the ball to Ivan. We only had 11 turnovers and we controlled the tempo of the game. I'm very proud of this team because they followed everything we asked of them."

The Golden Panthers went through some scary moments down the stretch as they saw their five-point, 69-64, lead with 2:01 to play dwindle. 

Boo Ramsey connected on a 3-point attempt to make the game interesting with FIU leading by two with 30.7 seconds to play. 

With only fouling to help them, Troy took their chances by fouling FIU's Fuller who in turn made two attempts from the charity stripe to put the Golden Panthers up 71-67. 

FIU went on to miss their next four free throws and Sharp made it a three-point game from the stripe. 

Needing a three pointer to tie, Troy, who leads the nation in three-point attempts per game, at 11.8 could not even get the attempt away as Fuller stole the inbounds pass to give the home side the victory. 

The match-up saw 12 ties in the score and nine lead changes.

Headline: Bad luck, poor decisions mar Bush's image
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
President George W. Bush has perhaps been one of the most controversial wartime presidents, but nothing new as far as wartime presidents go. Perhaps only Lyndon B. Johnson had it worse during Vietnam, with such strong opposition to the war effort. 

Through fire and brimstone, Bush has pushed his issues forward and has stood his ground, stubbornly at times - which have bred a vicious cycle of wrong turns and mistrusts. His staunch positions on the war might look like bravery and commitment to some, but seems like ignorance and pigheadedness to others.

There have been two sides to this coin as we have watched the unraveling of this past year's events, one side showing an increase of issues on our own soil and the other concerning issues abroad. The story of this administration's first year of its second term has not been solely on the United States and domestic policy; the administration has had bigger fish to fry.

Throughout his presidency there has been considerable talk of morality. Values, principles, ethics and ideals have come into play with almost every speech. Bush was pushing for a family-oriented society who chose, in his own words, the "right to life." Words such as Social Security and Medicare, however, didn't seem to be part of his vocabulary - especially after efforts to restructure both programs have seemingly failed.  

I applaud the president's faith in the people of his nation to serve one another on the domestic front, but we cannot do it alone - money is necessary. It wasn't until Hurricane Katrina rolled around - destroying critical infrastructure - did heads turn in our direction. 

The best of America became evident when the heroics of our nurses, doctors, firemen and public service people dove into rough waters and went through difficult terrain to save those in need. But was there enough support from the government? 

In a recent ABC/Washington Post poll, 53 percent to 47 percent still believe Bush does well in times of crisis. However, his overall approval ratings have gone down. 

Bush's place in foreign diplomacy is a horse of a different color. Two thoughts fly between the battle lines and are constantly at war with one another. The red, white and blue bandwagon - as I like to call it - supports the president's mission in the Middle East unconditionally. They back the government's decision no matter what country they choose to invade next. The United States liberated people from the hands of a murderous dictator, but faces a situation of discontent and unrest among the very soldiers who did the job. More and more soldiers are sent to calm the situation, but it sometimes seems that the situation only gets worse. The killing hasn't stopped; the number of dead people on both sides keeps rising.

The U.S. has a short-term memory when it comes to mistakes from the past, particularly involving different people and their societies; do the freedom fighters ring a bell?  If they don't, then the Taliban should, because that's what they were known as when the U.S. supported them in fighting Russia at the end of the Cold War. 

America provided them with weaponry and trained them, promising to uplift their nation after they helped us. Then they left them high and dry. U.S. officials say they are there to help Iraq, but all they seem to be doing is fueling a fire of distrust that has been burning even before September 11, 2001.

Despite all of the errors of the past year, saying that we can't rise up from our mistakes would be quitting and that's one thing we as a society must never do. Obviously, mistakes have been made and a lot of work must be done before Bush's second term takes a turn for the better. Bush has done what any president would do in the mid of war - he has stuck it out. Through criticism and high degrees of bad sentiment, he has stayed unwavering in his commitments, wherever they may lead him.  

Bush had the fortune and misfortune to be in charge when our country seemed to be tumbling. He has been given the opportunity to strengthen our country's greatest weaknesses, whether it is Medicare, homeland security or the very levees that failed during Hurricane Katrina, inundating New Orleans. Hopefully President Bush knows what he has to do; he has three years left to do it.

Headline: Tuition increase proposed
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
The Office of Gov. Jeb Bush proposed a 5 percent tuition increase for all public universities in Florida which would mark a 31 percent increase in Florida tuition over the last 5 years. In response to this announcement, the Florida Student Association held a press conference Feb. 13 to protest the proposal. The FSA is comprised of presidents of Student Government Associations of 11 state universities.

According to FIU SGA President Alex Prado, the FSA has an attorney who is voicing their concerns to the Office of the Governor in an attempt to cut off the proposal. Although Bush allocated 52.4 million dollars to help low income and minority students, FSA feels that raising tuition will not aid students.

"It is counter-productive to provide aid to students with one hand and raise tuition on these same students with the other," said Mike Fischer, executive director of FSA, in a press relase.

Prado feels optimistic about the outcome of the protest.

"I think it's looking good," Prado said. "Because FSA is coming together from 11 universities fighting [for] the whole student body, [the Governor] will have to work something out."

The Governor is scheduled to meet with Fischer and FSA members during the University's spring break to discuss the proposal.

FIU:
Middle East Society Speaker

A relevant issue all over the news, the success of Hamas' in the first real election held in Palestine has affected how America views future cooperation's with the Middle East as a whole.

Thus, The Middle East Society of FIU, a subset of the department of International Relations and Geography, is brining notable expert Haim Malka of the Center for Strategic and International Studies to address these issues and more Feb. 26 between 2-3:30 p.m. in AC1 194.Malka's lecture is entitled: "Hamas Electoral victory and the Redrawing of Middle East politics" and will delve into subsequent issues following the surprising election of a group many in today's administration and abroad believe to be a known terrorist group. The Middle East Society was an initiative that just began this academic year and headed up by director and assistant professor Sholomi Dinar. 

"Hamas victory in the Palestinian elections has changed the political landscape of this region and we are indeed fortunate to have an expert on the topic come to FIU," said Dinar in an e-mail to The Beacon.

Study for women in business launched

The Center for Leadership and the College of Business Administration along with The Commonwealth Institute has joined to conduct the 2006 Women in Business Leadership Study. 

The study consists of successful businesswomen throughout Florida who have a leadership role such as primary owners, senior executives and chief decision-makers of companies. Nationwide, women hold 50 percent of professional and managerial positions and only 3 percent of top positions are filled by women in businesses. Part of the research is to study the backgrounds of these women, their work habits and life choices. 

According to Joyce Elam, executive dean of the College of Business, the data is designed to push the economy forward.


National:
Documents removed from National archives

For seven years, a secret program at the National archives, that allows public access to thousands of historical documents has been removed by intelligence agencies. This includes documents that were available for years, that were published by the State Department and some even photocopied by historians. 

Historian Matthew M. Aid noticed that documents he had photocopied years ago had been removed from the archives. They were mostly reports from the Korean War and the Cold War. 

"The stuff they pulled should never have been removed," Aid said. "Some of it is mundane and some of it is outright ridiculous." 

After several historians complained, J. William Leonard, director of the Information Security Oversight office, began a revision of the program.


Global:
England supports U.S. pressure on Iraq

Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, arrived in Baghdad and told Iraq leaders that they needed to form national unity without the domination of a single group. 

Straw reinforced the pressure the United States has placed on Iraq leaders to put aside ethnic and sectarian differences.  Straw made these comments a day after U.S. ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, warned Iraqi leaders that they risk losing the United States support unless they find national unity and take away the police and the military from the hands of religious parties.

Headline: Hospitality campus in China to open Fall 2006
Author: Jose Maya / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU and the Tianjin University of Commerce are close to opening an accord to expand FIU's School of Hospitality Management, creating a new campus located in the city of Tianjin in the northeastern part of China; giving students a chance to study abroad while paying in-state tuition, starting this Fall semester.

"I am very excited and looking forward to this new campus," said Joseph West, dean of the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management. 

West traveled several times this past year to Tianjin and met with representatives from the Tianjin University of Commerce to organize this affair. 

The new campus will offer students a chance to study outside of Florida while paying in-state tuition, and  it also offers them a chance to experience a city full of history and culture.

The school will offer two major programs: a bachelor's degree in hospitality management and a bachelor's degree in travel and tourism management. 

Students will be allowed to enroll in August and the school is encouraging as many students as possible to sign up.

There are approximately 850 undergraduate, and 110 graduate active students in the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management. 

The school has an approximate 90 percent graduation rate. 

"We pursue, and give the students a desire to graduate," West said. 

West also mentioned that the school has a 100 percent job placement status, meaning that a student is guaranteed to have a job by the time they finish their senior year.

"The great thing about the hospitality industry is that it is the fastest growing industry in the world," West said. 

According to the faculty, the school is excited about the expansion and hopes for success. 

They also believe that the students will be receiving a great financial opportunity that will allow them to study abroad.

 "As a graduate from the School of Hospitality, I believe it is an opportunity of a lifetime," said Claudio Castillo, international enrollment manager for the school. 

"The Tianjin University of Commerce is putting in $30 million for this structure, so students should take advantage [of getting] to choose their own classes. They also have brand new classrooms, offices and living facilities."

The ground-breaking point for the FIU-China program was the foundation stone carving ceremony on April 8, 2004. 

FIU President Modesto A. Maidique and Wen Jun Wang, the dean of the School of Hospitality Management for TUC, attended the ceremony.

Also present were West, the TUC student delegation and Xiangrong Dai, the mayor of Tianjin.

Students, like Jamie Moreno, a student majoring in hospitality management also believe that the project favors the school. 

"I think it's a great opportunity for students who want to acquire more knowledge about another country and it sounds like a wonderful experience that you might only be able to acquire while in college," Moreno said.

Tianjin is located in China's northeastern plains and it is the closest seaport to Beijing. 

The city has an approximate population of 13 million and has China's largest container wharf; ships from all over the planet use its accessories. It is also the third largest city in China, according to www.wayabroad.com.

Headline: Crime statistics public on campus
Author: Andrew Leins / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
University Public Safety publishes a pamphlet every Fall semester on campus safety which features criminal statistics for the University, including statistics from the previous three years. 

The most recent data was released in October of 2005 with 2004 statistics.

"Crime statistics vary sometimes from year to year in cities and it's difficult to correlate a rise in a particular crime with any single variable. There are many factors that affect crime," said Public Safety Captain, Jesse Scott. 

Campus crime information is made available to the public in accordance with the 1998 Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. 

This law is named after Jeanne Clery, a freshman at Lehigh University, PA who was murdered while she slept in her dorm April 5, 1986.

According to these reports, the most common crime on campus is burglary of which there were 86 cases reported to FIU Police in 2004. 

This figure has risen since 2002 when there were 57 reported, and 75 in 2003. 

Burglaries at the student residence halls dropped from 35 in 2003 to 14 in 2004.

"One of the main ways we try to prevent burglaries is to educate people about crime on campus. A lot of burglaries are crimes of opportunity. We try and tell people to keep their doors locked and make sure their property is secured [because] sometimes they don't realize that this is a public University and people have access to the buildings," said Lieutenant Alphonse Ianniello, inspector and a 15 year veteran of Public Safety.

No homicides or manslaughters were reported in the past three years, and only one instance of a forcible sex offense occurred in 2004. 

Three arson cases occurred in 2004. Aggravated assaults rose from one to 14 between 2003 and 2004.

According to Ianniello, "An assault can be simply someone saying they are going to hurt you and you believe they can actually do it, when someone then hits you that would be a battery." 

 No hate crimes have been reported in the past three years. 

Only two liquor law violations and three drug law violations were reported to Public Safety in 2004. 

Larceny/theft cases were not included in the statistics published by Public Safety because universities are not required to do so according to federal guidelines in the Clery Act.  

"If people have to look for the information themselves then they probably won't look for it, but if it was made more available, like if the statistics were published in The Beacon, then more people might know about crime on campus because it would be right in front of them," said junior Ann-Marie Fernandez. 

Some have doubts on Public Safety, "There not as visible as I think they should be, there doesn't seem to be much of a presence at night [at] Biscayne Bay Campus, perhaps they should be patrolling the parking lot at night," said senior Michael Haines.

Another student agrees.

"I would have to stay here late sometimes at BBC, and there was no visible security. I would have to wait sometimes for a while by the bus stop and I wouldn't see any security, just the bus," said Ann-Marie Fernandez. 

Scott asserts that the department's philosophy is community-oriented policing. 

"We go out to freshman orientations, new employee orientations and give out our brochures. We communicate with housing administration every week and sometimes have a police officer stationed at a residence hall during the night," Scott said. 

Students can access information on crime prevention and view crime statistics on the Public Safety website, by clicking on the Faculty and Staff tab, on the FIU Homepage. 

The campus safety pamphlets are available in public safety offices.

Daily crime logs can be given to students upon request from Public Safety. 

Ianniello asserts that they continue to look for ways of bettering campus safety.

"We will increase the patrolling in areas where there were a lot of problems and try to make ourselves more visible putting patrol cars in the problem areas. We will also go to student orientations and educate students on crime. One of the best ways to fight crime is to educate people about it," Ianniello said.

Headline: Restaurant offers affordable lunch
Author: Carlos Olaechea / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU community now has a new addition to the dining options surrounding University Park in the form of a Thai restaurant called Jasmine Thai and Sushi. As with most Thai restaurants in Miami, the menu tends to be a bit on the pricey side.  

Also reflecting the Miami Thai restaurant trend, Jasmine boasts a sushi bar that prepares decent renditions of standard rolls, as well as a few creative additions interspersed throughout the menu, which also includes standard Japanese fare (Teriyaki, tempura, etc.). 

 The Thai lunch menu, however, is probably the main draw at Jasmine, as well as the most affordable. 

There is a selection of approximately 10 various Thai classics served with fried rice, a spring roll and a choice of either miso soup or house salad with ginger dressing for less than $10 each.

On my first visit, my dining partners and I opted for the salad, which was just at the satisfactory mark. It consisted almost entirely of torn pieces of iceberg lettuce that were heavily doused in what tasted like a prepackaged Japanese ginger dressing that comes on almost any complimentary salad in any low to mid range Japanese restaurant.  

The miso soup that we sampled on the second visit wasn't any better and it was obviously a powdered mix.  

On both visits, we sampled Jasmine's version of Thai iced tea.  On the first visit, the tea was quite weak, almost suggesting that it was watered down.  

The second visit yielded a tea that was closer to the real thing. The only downside of the refreshments were that we were charged almost $3 for each tea; which is about half of what a lunch special costs.

Despite these small flaws, Jasmine pleased us on both visits when the entrees arrived. I was very pleased with the red curry on my first visit.  The soupy concoction was sufficiently flecked with chicken pieces, red peppers and vegetables.  

The fried rice was fluffy, tender and mild enough to not overpower the curry. The spring roll, although not outstanding in itself, was crunchy and not too greasy.  

The pad Thai on my second visit was equally pleased with a plateful of tender rice noodles, scrambled eggs, chicken, peanuts, fresh bean sprouts and deliciously balanced sauce.  

The fried rice and the spring roll were also consistent with my last visit. On both visits, my dining partners ordered the basil chicken; which also demonstrated typical Thai balanced flavors and a generous amount of fresh basil.  The portions are enough to sate without feeling stuffed.

The FIU community now has a new addition to the dining options surrounding University Park in the form of a Thai restaurant called Jasmine Thai and Sushi. As with most Thai restaurants in Miami, the menu tends to be a bit on the pricey side.  

Also reflecting the Miami Thai restaurant trend, Jasmine boasts a sushi bar that prepares decent renditions of standard rolls, as well as a few creative additions interspersed throughout the menu, which also includes standard Japanese fare (Teriyaki, tempura, etc.). 

 The Thai lunch menu, however, is probably the main draw at Jasmine, as well as the most affordable. 

There is a selection of approximately 10 various Thai classics served with fried rice, a spring roll and a choice of either miso soup or house salad with ginger dressing for less than $10 each.

On my first visit, my dining partners and I opted for the salad, which was just at the satisfactory mark. It consisted almost entirely of torn pieces of iceberg lettuce that were heavily doused in what tasted like a prepackaged Japanese ginger dressing that comes on almost any complimentary salad in any low to mid range Japanese restaurant.  

The miso soup that we sampled on the second visit wasn't any better and it was obviously a powdered mix.  

On both visits, we sampled Jasmine's version of Thai iced tea.  On the first visit, the tea was quite weak, almost suggesting that it was watered down.  

The second visit yielded a tea that was closer to the real thing. The only downside of the refreshments were that we were charged almost $3 for each tea; which is about half of what a lunch special costs.

Despite these small flaws, Jasmine pleased us on both visits when the entrees arrived. I was very pleased with the red curry on my first visit.  The soupy concoction was sufficiently flecked with chicken pieces, red peppers and vegetables.  

The fried rice was fluffy, tender and mild enough to not overpower the curry. The spring roll, although not outstanding in itself, was crunchy and not too greasy.  

The pad Thai on my second visit was equally pleased with a plateful of tender rice noodles, scrambled eggs, chicken, peanuts, fresh bean sprouts and deliciously balanced sauce.  

The fried rice and the spring roll were also consistent with my last visit. On both visits, my dining partners ordered the basil chicken; which also demonstrated typical Thai balanced flavors and a generous amount of fresh basil.  The portions are enough to sate without feeling stuffed.

Headline: Faculty and staff dance, sing at annual talent show
Author: Olivia Sarracino / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Organized by the Dance Marathon and the Student Affairs Association, the Faculty and Staff Talent Show not only serves as a promotion to Dance Marathon, but it also helps raise money for the Miami Children's Hospital and Children's Miracle Network. 

The thirds annual talent show kicked off with The Salsa Kings performing the legendary Latin dance "La Rueda." Yet, it was the enthusiasm of the hosts, assistant director of Multicultural Programs Allison McComb and director of Campus Life and Orientation, Charlie Andrews, that made many of the spectators go wild. 

Once the show was in motion, it was time for four judges to evaluate the four acts. 

Walter Conklin representing the Applied Research Center performed the firsts act. In his third year as a participant, he played the electric guitar as he sang an original song called "The Hook."

Conklin needs inspiration to write such deep songs.

"I write songs depending [on] the mood I'm in," Conklin said.

The following act had everyone, standing on pins and needles as Orientation Graduate Assistant AJ Costa juggled her way to a standing ovation. Her juggling talent was nothing compared to her enchanting charisma and unique way of teaching.

"The misconception of jugglers is that people believe that they are good at catching things, but they spend more time dropping them," Costa said. 

She proved this misconception when she dropped the balls more than once. 

The third contestant of the night was graduate student Adam Moss performing a song.

"Singing is pretty new to me," Moss said. 

However, the final act was the highlight of the show, having the entire audience dancing to a mixture of country and hip-hop. 

The four talented dancers were Arram Agramonte representing International Student Services, AJ Costa and Heidi Richard from housing and residential, and Tara Warshaw from the Woman's Center. 

To junior Desman D. Daniels, the four girls were his favorite act. 

"[They were] great, I loved it!" said Daniels. 

The closing act of the four dancers made the call for the judges to make their final decision. 

In the meantime, the host and hostess asked the audience to join the silent auction that was taking place in the back of the ballroom. The auction included paintings, a Starbucks basket, and a gift certificate to Burrito Restaurant and Laser Hair Removal, among many others.  

When the time to announce the winner came, many, like sophomore Vanessa Pineda, weren't surprised to find out that it was AJ Costa's group who had won. Pineda had, prior to the announcement, said that she wanted Costa to win. 

The winning prize was a gift certificate that included dinner for two at Plaza de España.

Despite the small amount of performances, the talent show was a success. 

Marila Campusano an advisor for the Student Affairs Association wants more awareness for the talent show

 "[It] can serve as a good promotion for the Dance Marathon that is coming soon," Campusano said.

Putting together a show like this is not an easy task. Sophomore Daniel Estevez - one of the members of the Dance Marathon - is thankful that the faculty is willing to commit to the show. 

"It is their way to give back to the community," said Estevez. 

Whether it's by playing the guitar, singing an emotional song, juggling four balls or simply dancing to the most uncoordinated beats, these faculty and staff members have demonstrated that they are willing to devote their time to support the Dance Marathon.

Headline: Playwrighting: "My First Love"
Subheadline: Healy wins first place in festival competition
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As a student playwright, senior Amanda Healy has achieved tremendous success. Her short play "Firefly" was recently awarded first place in the playwright competition at the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival and the play may be competing for national recognition in April at the Kennedy Center Theatre in Washington D.C. 

In addition, her latest work, "An Occasion to Kiss," received a staged reading Feb. 19 in front of FIU students at the University Park campus.  

Healy, who's  double-majoring in theater and English, was raised with theater in her blood. Healy's mother constantly took her to see plays and piqued her interest in theater performance. In 11th grade, Amanda finally set foot on stage in a work entitled "Joseph and the Technicolor Dream Coat," a play performed by her high school's drama club. 

Throughout her time at FIU, Amanda has starred in several University plays including "Dracula," "Hair" and "Tartuffe." Although she has enjoyed all of her roles, Healy's favorite performance was as Bianca in Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew." 

"Shakespeare is one of my greatest loves," Healy said. "Playing Bianca in 'The Taming of the Shrew' was amazing because I had a leading role in my favorite playwright's work. It was a dream come true." 

Amanda has also had her share of odd roles during her time at FIU.

"My oddest role was as a reveler in last year's 'Dracula,'" Healy said. "All I had to do was run out on stage, play a triangle and say 'Where's the chicken?' in French." 

Despite her constant on stage appearances, Healy admits that stage performance is not her first love.

"Being a playwright is my first love. I love theater performance but I love writing plays even more," noted Healy.

Leroy Clark, former FIU theater department chair, played a crucial role in Healy's development as a playwright. Clark's playwrighting class gave Healy the idea for the award-winning short play "Firefly."

"I got the inspiration for 'Firefly' from an activity in my playwrighting class. I was given a prompt that involved writing about a situation where a teacher suddenly becomes a young student," Healy said.

The short play revolves around three sisters who go into the woods to perform a ritual involving a dead hamster. 

"The play deals with childhood innocence. In the play, the ritual is performed because one of the girls wants to join her hamster in death. Firefly is about seeing the harsh realities of life through the eyes of children," Healy said. 

Amanda's first full-length work "An Occasion to Kiss" is more straightforward.

"An Occasion to Kiss" is a romantic comedy about a girl who runs into a lot of problems in relationships. It's a trial and error thing. She finally discovers that the right person was in front of her all along. Stability in a relationship becomes the most important issue for her," Healy said.

After graduating from FIU this semester, Amanda plans on moving to the northeast to attend graduate school. With her graduation impending, Healy has some advice for dedicated theater students.

"Make sure you do everything you can while you're a student. You can't get anywhere in theater unless you constantly keep yourself busy with performances and other things. By being motivated and just doing things in theater, you'll get ahead in the future."

Stephen Neal, business manager of the theater department, is saddened by Healy's imminent departure. 

"Amanda is a modest girl and doesn't let things go to her head. She truly understands theater and will have a terrific future as a playwright. It's going to be sad to see her go," Neal said.
