Headline: Student fees to be used to renovate Aquatic Center
Author: Nicole Acosta / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
The Biscayne Bay Campus's Aquatic Center, which originally cost $1.4 million to build, will now undergo an estimated $1.5 million in renovations this Fall, according to an e-mail Victor Citarella, Facilities Management's associate vice president, sent to The Beacon July 25.

Rosa Jones, vice president of Student Affairs, confirmed the left over activities and services fees from student tutition administered by the Student Government Association and the Division of Student Affairs will fund a portion of the repairs.

Jones  said she spoke to both SGA councils about helping fund the repairs in a July interview with The Beacon.

According to Jones, these capital improvement funds or student fees, go toward the building and maintenance of non-academic buildings within a University, such as an Aquatic Center.

As of July, Marbely Hernandez, University Park's Student Government Council president, only knew SGA's funding contribution would be a "nice chunk of money," from their accumulated cash balance account. She also did not know an exact dollar amount of the account, only that it had been controlled mostly by the Division of Student Affairs and had been accumulating over time since the council was not aware of it's existence until last year.

"If we could assist the University in supporting this University pool, then it's something that we're [going to] look into. [Arthur "AJ" Meyer] and I want to have a lengthy meeting with Dr. Jones about what we could do because it's student money," Hernandez said in a July interview with The Beacon.

Katiana Saintable, BBC-SGC president, was unavailable for comment about the Aquatic Center repairs.

Elias Bardawil, associate director of campus recreation, said the Aquatic Center's damages were due to natural elements surrounding the facility.

"The Aquatic Center is 25 years old. It runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and it is surrounded by the beautiful Biscayne Bay [which] has taken a toll on the open-air facility, [such as] the salt air and salt water," Bardawil said.

Citarella said the Facilities Management had noticed "abnormally high invoices for water consumption for that facility."

"That led to an inspection by the department staff that discovered a number of discrepancies, including structural damages. That required the intervention of the FIU's Building Official (a unit within FMD's organization), to close the facility until repairs are completed," Citarella said via e-mail.

These structural damages include the Aquatic Center's filtration system, plumbing and spalling, or the expansion and subsequent cracking of the support within the concrete throughout the facility, Bardawil said.

"The picture has been fairly bleak in a sense that the figures and the initial estimates that we have gotten are significant because the pool is several years old. Due to the nature of the construction and because of how the pool's constructed, it's pillars and where it's sitting, there appears to be a need for significant repairs," Jones said.

Citarella said the Aquatic Center will be repaired and not demolished and rebuilt due to economic reasons.

"It would be significantly more expensive to demolish the existing facility and construct a new similar facility at an estimated cost of $2.7 million. It is cheaper to repair and upgrade to 'like-new condition' the existing facility for about a little more than one half of that amount," he said.

The Facilities Management construction staff, together with architectural and engineering consultant CORZO Castella Carballo Thompson Salma (C3TS), and contractor, Dooleymack Constructors, has been evaluating the extent of the Aquatic Center's repairs since the summer in order to finish the necessary renovations, Bardawil said.

A recommendation was made last week to have the Aquatic Center remain closed until its completion rather than keep it open during various stages of repairs, an option that had been considered, according to Cathy Akens, assistant vice president of Student Affairs.

As to whether or not this recommendation was given as a result of safety concerns or efficiency issues related to the project's completion, Bardawil said it was a combination of the two.

"It will allow us to open the Aquatic Center with a more direct timeline, which will, in turn, save on our fiscal resources. But most importantly, it is the safety of the students, faculty, staff and community that the Division of Student Affairs is looking out for," he said.

The Division of Student Affairs will receive an Aquatic Center construction document and by mid to late October and should contain a guaranteed maximum cost for the project, according to a Beacon interview with Akens held Sept. 18.

"The scope of the project is so large, there has to be an assessment of issues about the way to carry out the project. The costs, the budget and the construction document will give us a final plan on how the project's timeline will be carried out," Akens said.

Headline: Priest overcomes city, high school to find calling
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
While arguing before the United States Supreme Court, the City of Hialeah presented several reasons to ban priest Ernesto Pichardo's religion, Lukumi-Yoruba, also known as Cuban santeria. 

The city tried to prove the religion's animal sacrifice rituals were an unnecessary cruelty to animals, a hazard to public safety and psychologically traumatic to children.  

A unanimous decision ruled in favor of the Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye in 1993 allowing humane animal sacrifices.

"We live in a Judeo-Christian society where Jesus was the ultimate, last sacrifice," Pichardo said. "Religious perception associates Cuban santeria with Africa, then primitive people, then tribal and evil people." 

During the trial, Pichardo presented the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, which requires that animals being sacrificed die instantly, to the U.S. Supreme Court. 

This proved the animal offerings involved in Cuban santeria were instantaneous deaths and not cruel and unusual.

"[Most Americans] live in rural America, take the lives of animals everyday," Pichardo said. 

According to The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, people are required to obtain a hunting license.  

He stood before the courts and spoke about the religion he has practiced since he was ordained at 16, when he witnessed his first animal offering.

Pichardo now imparts his knowledge to students at the Biscayne Bay Campus as he teaches about santeria in his Transnational Perspectives class.

"I invite students to learn about our treatment of animals [which] is in compartments: for food, for the environment that is connected to God," Pichardo said. 

He uses his experiences to repeat what he has explained to thousands of people for more than 20 years: santeria is not a savage diabolical religion.

"It's a faith that believes in one God, sub-deities with creative attributes, ancestor and nature worship with no hell or devil," Pichardo said. "Animal offerings seem to be the integral part of our faith, but it is the least thing that we do."

Akin Ogundiran, African New World Studies director, is responsible for convincing the longtime practitioner and scholar of santeria to teach at FIU.

"For him to bring that experience, history with religion, with the First Amendment case and with his unique perspective is amazing," Ogundiran said.

Pichardo came to the United States as a Cuban exile at the age of six. He spent 10 years in the public school system until he was expelled for missing 30 days of school following his official ordination into the priesthood. 

Sango, a Yoruba divinity, chose him to  be ordained before birth.

"My ordination was something that had been destined going back to my mother's pregnancy; it was already foretold," Pichardo said. "At the age of 16, I encountered Cuban santeria to be something real and true to me." 

The majority of the absences were not a result of his ordination, but because, according to Pichardo, the assistant principal of Hialeah High School used him as an informant to blow the whistle on his fellow classmates regarding drug deals and any other activity against school policy. 

"I never did get it; I shouldn't be yanked out of a classroom and given an 'F' for the day," Pichardo said.

Following his expulsion, he concentrated on his religious training in a program at the University of Miami and what was then Miami-Dade Community College.

Pichardo later used his training years to protect the religion.

Fellow santeria priest Jesus Suarez defended Cuban santeria during the First Amendment trial with Pichardo. Suarez recalls the trial as a moment when Pichardo used some of his defining characteristics as a professor and person.

"He has the extraordinary ability to keep cool," Suarez said. 

Currently, Pichardo is not scheduled to return next year, but Ogundiran hopes to convince him otherwise.

Headline: 2007-2008 Theatre Preview: Department showcases rock musical
Author: Lucia Sastre / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This season, the FIU Theater Department has scheduled several plays that, according to Phillip Church, associate theatre professor, will be relevant to students living in this idle saturation of society. 

"It is important to note that we live in a world portrayed by violence and materialism. These productions are released in order to remind us of that fault, and perhaps change them as time moves on," Church said.   

An example of such a play showing the true side of humanism and reality is The Who's "Tommy" a rock concert first performed in 1974 and turned into a Broadway musical nearly 20 years later when The Who guitarist Pete Townsend and Des McEnuff, artistic director of San Diego's La Jolla Playhouse, collaborated.

The story consists of a boy who ultimately is forced to overcome his physical deficiencies and accept life as it comes.

"This uniquely crafted story is about a journey of self discovery which takes place in London at the start of World War II," Church said.

After returning from the war, Tommy's father who was thought to be missing in action, discovers his wife moved on with a new man. A short fight ensues, and the father kills the lover in self-defense. 

After witnessing the murder in the reflection of a mirror, Tommy, who is four-years-old, is left deaf, dumb and blind. From then on, Tommy's journey takes him through the '40s, '50s and '60s. 

As the cast works to prepare for the performance of the well-known musical, long nights consume many of the members' schedules.

"For many theater students being involved in these productions is both rewarding and overwhelming," said Wayne Robinson, who is currently working on the production "Electricidad." "Many of the students in the fall cast would also be involved in the spring and in plays in between, making their schedule hectic and their hours limited."

The Who's "Tommy" production will be held at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center Oct. 18-28. 

This Fall, students can also expect to see the play "As Bees in Honey Drown," which is a comedy dealing with the quest to find fame and fortune. 

"I think we all need to laugh once in a while. School definitely gets you stressed out with all the classes and having an outlet like this play is definitely alleviating," said Marian Carrasquel, a sophomore and frequent FIU theatre attendee.

This hilarious comedy by Douglas Carter Beane, which has won the Outer Critics Circle Award and an Obie Award, will be performed from Nov. 8-18.

Another production, "Electricidad" is set to be performed in the Spring semester.

Based on playwright Luis Alfaro's creation, the work is derived from classic tales of vengeance by Sophocles and Euripedes featuring the character of Electra, but updated and set in the barrios of east Los Angeles.

"This play deals with family issues, history, fate and revenge, Robinson said, who is the director of this show. "It portrays a sense of life and death as almost being around the corner; a quest for survival."

Some students, such as sophomore Tania Santiago, are already excited about witnessing the play unfold on stage because of the Hispanic-theme surrounding it.

"I can't wait to see this play, not only because I'm Hispanic, but because it's very cultural based, and it shows the crude reality of our world," Santiago said.  

Performance times are Thursday, Friday, Saturday nights at 8 p.m. and Sunday afternoons at 2 p.m. 

Tickets for the musicals are $18 for general admission and $15 for FIU students & alumni. 

Tickets for the other shows are $12 for general admission and $10 for FIU students & alumni.All shows take place on the University Park Campus in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center Theatre.

Headline: Blogging makes late-breaking news available faster
Author: Elyse Coleman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the ability to be updated much faster than print and broadcast news, the blog, a site that serves as an online journal, is becoming increasingly popular among writers and news junkies alike. 

Technorati, a blog search engine, is currently tracking more than 104 million blogs and estimates that 175,000 blogs are created each day and updated over 1.6 million times per day.

LiveJournal, a popular blogging site, reports 1.7 million active accounts with a majority of users between the ages of 16 and 23, 19 being the peak age. 

"I've been a member of LiveJournal for six years and I love the wealth of information and community that I can find on there," said EJ. Greaves, a senior.

Created in 1999, LiveJournal is known for catering to a wide variety of interests including celebrities, online comics, news and even blogging itself. 

For some students, blogging on these sites such is seen as one way of expressing one's opinions to the world without censorship.

"Personal blogs can be looked at as a positive thing," said senior Chrisnatha Derosier, a senior. "They are sometimes therapeutic for the person writing it. They give the writer the opportunity to be honest and express themselves through journal writing."

But blogs have other uses aside from personal enjoyment and therapy. 

Independent online news journals received national attention in 1998 when Matt Drudge, proprietor of the The Drudge Report, was the first to report on the President Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal.

However, it wasn't until the Sept.11 terrorist attacks that blogging really came into the public eye.

"After 9/11, the Bush administration made it very clear to watch what you say," said professor Allan Richards, who teaches a course on online journalism. "And they were very careful as evidenced by the newspapers at the time. If journalists couldn't write something mainstream, [however], they would write something on their blog sites."

On Aug. 17, celebrity gossip blogger Mario Armando Lavandeira Jr., aka Perez Hilton, posted a rumor that dictator Fidel Castro had died, followed by two posts on Aug. 24 where Lavandeira falsely confirmed that Castro was dead. 

The entries spread like wildfire on the Internet, creating hysteria in South Florida.

"Perez Hilton is not a journalist. He's a blogger," said Leslie Gray Streeter, a writer for the Palm Beach Post who writes the entertainment blog, The Pop Shop. "The difference is that he doesn't have a journalistic background. As a critic, my opinions are based on things that are factual. I can't put up unsubstantiated rumors on my blog."

Lavandeira has yet to apologize or retract his statements and the entries can still be seen on perezhilton.com.

Personal blogs are also not without controversy either. 

This past May, LiveJournal teamed up with Internet watchdog organization Warriors for Innocence to review journals and delete accounts containing any pedophilic content. 

Journals with words related to pedophilia, rape or incest in the user's interest section were deleted without warning or explanation. Around 500 accounts were deleted, a majority of them containing no inappropriate content. 

On May 31, LiveJournal issued an apology and is in the process of reviewing and reinstated suspended accounts as they see appropriate.

As the popularity of blogging continues to rise, the ways in which people blog are changing. 

According to an April 27, 2006 article in Business 2.0, Mefeedia, the vlog-centric equivalent to Technorati, tracked over 6,500 vlogs, blogs with video content; only 300 vlogs were listed the previous year. 

Currently, Mefeedia lists more than 15,000. 

However, vlogging doesn't owe its rising popularity to blogging as much as it does to podcasts and the Apple iPod.

According to Wired magazine, vlogging began its rise to popularity with the video iPod. 

Podcasts were initially audio-only recordings of professional or amateur broadcasts created to be downloaded to the iPod, though an iPod is not required to listen to them. 

Once the video iPod was released, podcasts began to turn to video as well. 

"I see [vlogging] continuing to grow," said David Houle, proprietor of future-centered blog Evolution Shift. "I myself will be starting to do some video before the year is out. I believe that we have become more image-driven as a culture, [and] 2005 - 2007 will be looked at as the explosive initial age of the blogosphere."

Headline: My Life! Experience: Student overcomes disorder with tenacity, medication
Author: Jose Martinez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
There have been many times in the past where I have felt lost and overcome by confusion, going through the world without knowing what I'm doing or where I'm headed. 

This confusion aptly describes the periods of my life when I'm off my medications.

Such periods are also marked by bursts of energy that I don't know how to expend. 

I get the urge to run in circles, moving from one random task to another, not giving any thought to my actions. 

I'm not the only person in the United States to suffer from Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD/ADD). 

The American Psychological Association (APA) estimates that some three to seven percent of all school-aged children meet the criteria needed to be diagnosed with the disorder.

I was originally diagnosed with ADHD in the second grade, when my mother listened to my teachers' suggestions and had me evaluated. 

Since then, I've taken somewhere in the realm of 10 to 15 different medications to help me cope with the symptoms. 

I can say with certainty that had I not found the right medication to remedy the problem, I would most likely not have even made it to college.

Some of the more awkward aspects of my life, however, have been the interactions I have had with my family members, many of whom are also afflicted with ADHD. 

One of the moments I dread the most is having to sit in the passenger seat of my father's car, hoping and praying he knows where he's going and what his surroundings are like. 

I remember instances where my dad would spend a whole 20 seconds stopped at a traffic light, unaware that it had changed from red to green. 

Other times, he would fall asleep while driving and have to shake his head spasmodically to regain his focus.

My father is the perfect example of what happens to an individual suffering from a severe case of ADHD. 

He often tells me in the time we spend together that he could never quite focus on his studies and found other diversions to prevent his mind from wandering. 

He always emphasizes the importance of me continuing my studies, and I could see why. 

For my father, work was the only way to expend the incessant energy he possessed. 

"I had my first job by the time I was ten- years-old," he told me. 

To this day, my dad works feverishly - despite being 60-years-old - in construction, a line of work that would normally break men his age.

My aunt also suffers from the very same problems that haunt my father, only worse. She has totaled more cars than even the most persistent drunkard out there. 

I remember a time where she was going into the freezer to get some ice cubes and she instead pulled out a frozen chicken. 

She then proceeded to bash the chicken repeatedly on the counter-top before realizing what it was.

These experiences illustrate just how much of an impact ADHD has had on my life and my loved ones. 

People who say that the whole ADHD "phenomenon" is an attempt by the behavioral sciences to create a disorder that does not exist annoy me. 

I have lived the majority of my life wondering why I was never able to realize my academic potential, why I could never channel my talents, my energies, into something productive. 

It was because there was something in the way, something beyond my grasp that just kept prying me in a million different directions. 

For much of my life, I felt as if my destiny was beyond my control; I was a victim of my impulses. 

When I found the right medication and the right mind set, my life changed for the better and I am now able to pursue my dream of becoming a psychiatrist, helping individuals in situations similar to my own. 

ADHD is real, but just like any other obstacle I've encountered throughout my life, I have gradually come to learn that it is not insurmountable - it can be overcomed just like anything else - all you need is persistence.

Headline: COMMUNITY MOURNS LOSS: Officer's death not forgotten
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Thousands of people filled Pharmed Arena Sept. 18 to pay respect to slain Miami-Dade Police Officer and FIU alumnus Jose Somohano.

Somohano, 37, married and father of two, died Sept. 13 after being shot byShawn LaBreet who also injured three officers- one of them an FIU student. Sohomano received a degree from FIU in criminal justice. 

Attendees on the second story of the stadium were left with only enough room to stand against the railings and looking down into a pit of navy, black, brown, green and white-uniformed officers. 

According to Maydel Santana-Bravo, director of media relations at FIU, anywhere from 50 to 100 different police agencies from both inside and outside of Florida were in attendance at the service.  

In anticipation of the additional 5,000 to 6,000 mourners expected to attend the ceremony, FIU announced the day before that morning classes at University Park would be canceled for the day of the ceremony. 

"I didn't like canceling classes but, given the situation, I felt it was something we should do to give back to the community," said Ronald Berkman, FIU provost, at a Faculty Senate meeting held the same day. 

Closing the University was also a result of the overwhelming number of people who wanted to attend to the service, Santana-Bravo said.

Before the ceremony, police officers and color guards lined the sides of the street where the hearse carrying Somohano would pass and bagpipe and drum players practiced under a tree off to the side.

"Fortunately or unfortunately, we play at all of the police funerals this way -and we've played too many lately," said Frank Moran, a drum player with the Police Pipe and Drum Corps.  "It's just a shame," he said.

Inside, the arena was quiet considering the amount of people present. When it was announced that the Somohano family was nearing, everyone rose to their feet as if doing a somber and deliberate wave seen at sports games. The packed arena fell into complete silence as the officers waited, hats in hand, for the motorcade carrying Somohano to arrive. 

Eight people struggled with the weight of Somohano's American-flag covered casket as they pulled it out of the silver and black hearse and made their way inside the arena, followed by the officer's family and friends. At the command of a shouting officer, everyone present saluted simultaneously as the funeral party processed down the long aisle to the front of the stage.  "I stand before you with a heavy heart," said Robert Parker, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department, at the opening of the ceremony. 

The ceremony continued with many speakers, among them Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez, who spoke to the law enforcement community as the officer he once was.

"I know that no words will heal your pain," Alvarez said to the Somohano family. "No words will bring back your father, your husband and your son." 

Alvarez likened Somohano to a hero for his ultimate sacrifice.

"He is an American hero because he laid down his life for what he believed in," Alvarez said.

FIU President Modesto Maidique also spoke on behalf of the FIU community.

"FIU is in mourning today because our family has lost one of theirs," Maidique said.

Maidique also offered Somohano's children full tuition to FIU when they come of age. The crowd gave a standing ovation in response to Maidique's offer. 

"Offering scholarships to the children of Officer Jose Somohano is one of the few tangible things we can do as a university community for this grieving family," Maidique told the Office of Media Relations. 

Lieutenant Denise Bernhard delivered an intimate, yet bittersweet, account of what it was like to know Somohano. He was described as extremely meticulous -even organizing his action figures by rank and file- and said he had a "soft spot" for old ladies when interviewing witnesses.

"When I finish sharing a little about him, you will be jealous you didn't know him," Bernard said. 

When Bernard asked that everyone who knew, loved or respected Somohano to stand up, the entire crowd rose to their feet and applauded in support. 

A montage tribute followed, to the tune "Bad Boys" from the television show Cops, a song Somohano loved.

The casket was then followed out in the same way it came in, with bagpipes and salutes, and cars lined up for the funeral procession to Caballero-Rivero Woodlawn Cemetery where the service continued.

Headline: UP-SGC president uses opportunity to make a difference
Author: Vanessa A. Alvarez  / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
It is 8 a.m. on a Wednesday summer morning. Most college students are deep in sleep, but for Marbely Hernandez, University Park Student Government Association president, sleep is simply not an option.    

As a peer mentor in last summer's FIU mentoring program, Hernandez was not just up bright and early, but also ready to contribute as much as she could to the freshmen experience class she helped lead.

"My purpose as a peer mentor was to be there for the students and give them someone that they could relate to," Hernandez said.  

The SGC-UP president, who plans to attend FIU Law School after she earns her bachelor's in political science, has excelled in every arena of SGA. She completed the SGA internship program during her freshman year in Fall 2004 and moved herself up through representative positions in both the Lower and Upper Divisions in 2005 and 2006, respectively.  

As president, Hernandez plans to guide FIU into new horizons.  

"It has definitely been a big challenge but I feel I have a lot of offer FIU.  This is not only an opportunity for myself but it is also a chance to create change for SGA," Hernandez said.

And creating change is exactly what Hernandez's SGA administration strives to achieve.  This year's SGA has already accomplished three of the 12 goals it set for itself this year and a fourth goal will be up and running sometime this semester.  

The administration wants to open its doors to students and create an atmosphere of school spirit and campus involvement.  

"My biggest goal is to see many people running next year and wanting to be involved in SGA," Hernandez said. 

Katie McGee, the staff director for the 2007 Miss FIU Scholarship Pageant and assistant director for the Office of Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution, describes Hernandez as a "trooper" and "beyond dedicated." 

"She just goes above and beyond. I don't think people realize how much she cares.  She's very dedicated to improving students' lives here; she works tirelessly to give students opportunities and to get the students' voices heard," McGee said.  

Both Hernandez and McGee helped put together the 2007 Miss FIU Scholarship Pageant by jointly organizing paperwork and making sure that winners were awarded scholarship funds. Hernandez was the student director of the event.

"Marbely was adamant to see that the scholarship money was set aside for each of the top three winners," McGee said, "What was most important to her was to see that FIU was represented at Miss Florida."

The first in her family to attend college, Hernandez opted to dedicate herself to the students and to improving FIU. 

Besides becoming involved in SGA, she rushed for the Alpha Xi Delta sorority, where she held the position of scholarship and academic achievement chair. 

"That's the thing about Marbely, she is always willing to help," said Catalina Gonzalez, president of the Alpha Xi Delta sorority.

Outside academics, Hernandez, who danced since the age of four, also participated as both a dancer and Morale Captain for Dance Marathon, the largest on-campus student-run philanthropic event -whose proceeds benefit Miami Children's Hospital year after year.

"Marbely, I think, excels at everything she does.  I would say she's extremely committed to all her causes," Gonzalez said. "She's a very passionate person and her passion reflects in all she does." 

Hernandez, who spends most of her time in the SGA office between classes, also helps her parents with their family-run company.  

Her parents are her biggest supporters. Alba Hernandez, her mother, says that when Hernandez won the SGA presidency, the family got together and threw Hernandez a small party at the Amelia Earhart Park in Hialeah.

"We are very happy with all her choices," Hernandez said.  "She's an amazing daughter and both her father and I are very proud. She deserves it all." 

After she is done with Law School, Hernandez says she wants to become a lobbyist for higher education and work as a representative for state of Florida. And when referred back to FIU, she says she'd like to leave behind excellence.

"I hope to be remembered as a hard worker, an achiever; someone who knows the value of an organization and uses it to the benefit of the student," she said.  "SGA is not Marbely Hernandez, it is everyone who holds each and every position; it is the students voicing their concerns and us taking action; it's everyone getting together and achieving success."

Headline: Muslim students invite others to embrace culture
Author: Andrew Leins / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Ramadan -the time of the year when Muslims fast for an entire month, eating only after the sun goes down- is celebrated this year from the sunset of Sept. 13 to Oct. 12. 

FIU's Muslim Student Association, which gives Muslim students the chance to connect with one another on campus and reach out to the community, has several events planed to celebrate the month.

Its members will be meeting for prayers every weekday in the Graham Center, room 343 and will also meet daily for the breaking of fast at sundown in GC 241. 

As well, MSA wants to expand the awareness and knowledge of Muslim traditions in the FIU community and will be having an event to give non-Muslims a chance to learn more about Ramadan.

On Sept 26, at 6 p.m., MSA will host Fast-a-Thon in the GC Ballrooms, which will feature a lecture and a meal after sundown. Some of the food will be served as according to Islamic law, also known as Halal. 

"We'll have all kinds of food, no pork though, we invite students to fast for one day and then come and have dinner with us," said Vice-President of the MSA Ismael Bahr, 23, who is majoring in international relations.

For Bahr, the club's focus is to "lead by example."

 "We try to educate people about Islam and show a positive image of the Muslim community. We try to show people that we are not what they see on television. Some people use Islam for political purposes, which is against Islam," Bahr said

Ramadan is the name of the ninth month of the year in the Islamic calendar and celebrates the time when the Holy Qu'ran was sent down from heaven and revealed.

During this month, Muslims concentrate on their faith and spend less time on the concerns of their every day lives. It is a time of worship, reflection and gratitude.

The MSA has been in existence for about 20 years according to Lynda Raheem, faculty advisor for MSA and assistant dean at the College of Business Administration.

 "The MSA was started with the idea of helping Muslims who came from abroad to adjust to life in this country and also to provide non-Muslims a chance to learn more about Islam," Raheem said.

Muslim student Nasim Ahmed, who sits as sister activities coordinator for the MSA and is majoring in accounting, enjoys the lectures on Islam MSA organizes, which helped her understand more about her religion. 

"I wanted to learn more about my faith, before I came to college I never knew why we prayed five times a day or why we fasted, till I did research and learned more about my faith. It makes my actions more meaningful," Ahmed said.

Throughout the year, MSA meets on Fridays at 1:30 p.m. for Jumu'ah prayers in GC 343. This kind of prayer is shorter than the daily prayers and is usually followed by a sermon or a communal prayer led by an Imam, the officiating priest of a mosque.

This Fall, MSA also plans to have an inter-faith seminar where Muslim, Christian and Jewish scholars will be invited to attend and speak on religious issues. 

MSA organizes several lectures throughout the year, usually featuring Muslim scholars. 

Prayer and meeting hours vary each day depending on the sun's position and are available at MSA's Web site www.msafiu.com.

Headline: Show breaches legal boundaries
Author: Eric Feldman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The issue of child predators has  been continually addressed in the media over the past few years, and  law enforcement agencies have been focusing on using the Internet to find persons using the Web in hopes of soliciting sex from minors. By posing as children, officers arrange to meet with predators who are subsequently arrested. 

These stings have been very profitable to outlets such as NBC who regularly air them on the investigative series "To Catch a Predator."

 Some students from the Miami area probably remember WSVN-7 meteorologist Bill Kamal, who was arrested for meeting a fictional "young boy" he met via the Internet.

   Many parents became alarmed when the Broward Sheriff's Office launched a Web site where one could search for registered sex offenders in their area, and The New York Times recently reported that various agencies are using the popular website Craigslist.org in order to weed out individuals soliciting sex.  

All of the fear caused by the aforementioned have acted as a catalyst for "Dateline" NBC to capitalize on the situation and you have to question the motives of the show's investigations.  

The fact that the program makes no attempt to conceal the identity of these men but rather aims to humiliate them from multiple camera angles once the sting is revealed, proving that host Chris Hansen and his team are more concerned with powerful television than a legitimate investigation. 

It is a given that television is ultimately about ratings, and thus, profit.  

It is a business, and this is understandable. But there are some things that should be kept from being turned into cheap entertainment, and this is one of them.  

In no situation is it all right for the media to nationally crucify an innocent person.  

How can I call these "perverts" innocent?  

Because at the time of the airing of the show they have not been convicted in a court of law. Every human being under the U.S. legal system is innocent until that occurs.  

Once we start making exceptions to this rule, we will end up back in the days of the Salem witch trials.  

There is also the issue of entrapment, which is the legal defense that a suspect was incited to commit a crime by law enforcement. 

In some of the investigations, it is the decoy who mentions sex first, or otherwise hints, such as by saying that they will be home alone, to imply that a visit should be in order.    

In addition to the moral boundaries possibly violated by NBC, officials who participate with the show may be shooting themselves in the foot when it comes to protecting children.  

According to WFAA, a news affiliate based in Texas near where one episode was based, the district attorney will not even prosecute the 23 men arrested on the show due to concerns over whether the arrests were even legal due to them being orchestrated by private companies who are earning a profit from the operations.  

NBC may want you to think that they are doing a public service by exposing these criminals but they are really only humiliating the potentially innocent, and possibly sending actual threats back onto the street because their shoddy work can't even get a conviction.

The most important lesson here is do not buy into the paranoia sold to you without investigating for yourself.   

The media is an expert at taking advantage of insecurities and they will continue to do so as long as there is a buck to be had.  

Every situation, no matter how straightforward it may seem, leaves room for intellectual discourse and shows like Hansen's aims to undermine this through sensationalism.  

FIU students are above this cognitive level and should be able to tackle social problems through logic and reason rather than fear-mongering propaganda.

Headline: Letter to the Editor #1: There are traitors amongs us
Author: Joe Vazquez / Alumnus, 2007 / Political Science Major 
&nbsp;
FIU vs. University of Miami...You would think FIU students would support and take pride in their school. But this seems too much to ask when playing a nationally recognized school such as UM. 

Now while I cannot provide any direct proof, there have been many rumors and I have been told by many people that at this past Saturday's game, there were many FIU students dressed and actively supporting the opposition and can be seen in the many pictures taken at the pre-game tailgates. Furthermore, I have been informed that many of these pictures of traitors are of our, otherwise very spirited, Greek community at FIU. 

Regardless of whom these traitors are they should be ashamed of their actions. To me these actions are of cowards who are sore losers and do not deserve to be part of our institution and if ever found these individuals should be publicly denounced. Those of us who have worked hard to help develop the University and contribute to its spirit, feel let down and I suggest that if you know any of these traitors you should make it public. 

By doing this we can purge the filthy traitors from our University and begin again with students who are truly Golden Panthers.

Headline: Artist looks for potential nude models for next art installation
Author: Daniella Bacigalupo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A press release has been circulating around the FIU Honors College and Art Department asking students to take their clothes off and stand next to other naked people ... in the name of art.  

"For me, [being part of it] would all depend. If I didn't know anyone there and there's a lot of people doing it then you kind of lose your identity," Perry Narcisse, an FIU alum majoring in business, said. 

Narcisse refers to Spencer Tunick's latest installation that will take place at the Sagamore Hotel in Miami Beach Oct. 8. 

Tunick, the world renowned American installation artist, began photographing nudes in 1992 and since then has stretched the worlds', but most markedly, American society's boundaries on nudity and its acceptance. 

"Every artist always tries to find a uniqueness to their work," Martin Z. Margulies, a Miami art collector, owner The Margulies Collection at the Warehouse photography gallery and owner of various sculptures around the University Park campus, said. 

Tunick's uniqueness comes from the massive number of nude people that compose his artwork; his largest group figured 18,000 people in Mexico City. 

Several arrests and a lawsuit from current Senator and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, underline the discomfort and censorship tendencies that American society has toward nudism.  

Despite the criticism and society's inhibitions, thousands of people have participated in Tunick's work internationally and in various American cities; the appeal seems to originate from the break that Tunick's art, intentionally or unintentionally, causes in the inclination to associate nudity with sexuality.  

"There is one photograph of his, where there are thousands of bodies lying down on the ground, and you look at some of those bodies and they resemble a concentration camp. It has a real macabre feeling to it. There are just many dimensions to his work," Margulies said. 

But for Margulies, the significance in Tunick's work does not lie solely on the innovative use of nude bodies. 

"This is not just about a piece of art, there is a process involved: scouting locations, ads in newspapers for volunteers, government approval, permits, police security and lining up people. He has a lot of logistics involved," Margulies said. 

FIU art students can benefit from watching Tunick orchestrate this massive process. 

"Art school is very much about making a name for yourself rather than participating and collaborating as a whole. But art does not have to be artsy or individual. [By participating], art students can learn about the infrastructure on how something happens, dealing with large amounts of people and watching the whole process. They can be a part of something and then see it materialize in an exhibition," Tunick said. 

To register, students can log onto Tunick's Web site, http://www.spencertunick.com/, and click on the "Miami Installation" link. Participants must be 18 or older and will only be nude for a short period of time. There is no deadline to register, up to publication date.

Headline: Commentary: Team loses as passing game falters
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This past weekend's game was almost an instant replay of the previous week against Maryland. The score was nearly the same and FIU's lone touchdown came on the exact same play as it did on Sept 15. However, there was one key difference: the team played the University of Miami.

The Golden Panthers' perfromance improved from last year's game against that big college located nine miles down the road who shut out FIU 35-0 in last year's meeting. This time they managed to get on the scoreboard twice and only gave up two touchdowns to a talented Hurricanes offense. 

A'Mod Ned led the Golden Panthers with 87 yards on the ground and picked up some key first downs. Wayne Younger passed for 105 yards and had a 65-yard touchdown pass to Trenard Turner on the same play action double fake that he scored with last week.

One big surprise for FIU this season has been the punting of Chris Cook. After setting a new school record last week with a 66-yard punt, Cook managed to have two of his punts against UM go out of bounds at the one-yard line. This amazing feat is a perfect example of kicking a "coffin corner" punt which happens when a kicker aims for the corner of the field rather then just kicking the ball out of the end zone.

UM did most of its damage with its passing game, which was capped off by an 80-yard touchdown pass from Kyle Wright to Lance Leggett in the third quarter. Passing was also a problem when FIU was on offense as Younger only completed six passes. After the game, Head coach Mario Cristobal was quick to address the need to improve the passing game. 

"I think we have to do a better job of throwing the football when we have to," Cristobal said. "I mean, our running game has definitely picked up. Our quarterback showed that when he does have to run with the football he can do that. Our offensive line held up relatively well against a team that can really rush the passer." 

FIU is making some strides and performing pretty well against some strong teams, but they will need to become more consistent across the board if they want to become a winning team. 

With Duke winning on Sept. 15, FIU now has the longest active losing streak in division I-A football with 15 consecutive losses. Hopefully this pathetic stat will serve to motivate the team to have a very short stay on this record list.

On a positive note, the Golden Panthers did not have any players suspended indefinitely after this meeting with UM. 

The players behaved as if NFL commissioner Roger Goodell would handle any misconduct and it led to a clean game on the field. However, there were numerous fights in the stands and some fans were arrested. 

It is unclear whether FIU and UM will play next year. Hopefully, the conduct of the teams on Saturday showed that they can play a clean game. 

Without a doubt the fans would love to have another backyard bowl. Because several players and coaches  on both teams have play and coached together in other teams in the past, it's always extra special when cross-town teams play against each other.

For example, Randy Shannon coached against his son Xavier and against Cristobal. his former teammate. Several siblings were on opposite sidelines like Um's Kenny Phillips and FIU's Alonzia Phillips. Also, FIU's Lloyd Moss is the brother of former hurricanes Santana and Sinorice Moss. 

FIU has gone into every game this season as a major  underdog with odds makers thinking the team will be beaten by large margins every game. However, in FIU's last two games, the odds-makers have been proven wrong as FIU has managed to keep its games close.

Headline: Men's Basketball: New assistant looks to help shape team for future
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Men's basketball coach Sergio Rouco announced Kevin Fricke as the newest member of the Golden Panthers coaching staff Sept. 14. 

Fricke has been coaching against FIU as an assistant coach for the University of Little-Rock Arkansas, a Sun Belt Conference foe, for 11 years.

He helped UALR post players Darius Eason and Ryan Moss towards gaining numerous offensive and defensive accolades. 

Fricke also helped Montrelle Dibbons win the 2007 Sun Belt Player of the Year honors.

Fricke will be working with new FIU big men Russell Hicks and Badara Ndiaye to help them learn to dominate the paint and developa strong inside presence. 

In addition to working at UALR, he was also the interim head coach at Moberly Area Community College where he led the team to a 15-12 record despite taking the job two weeks prior to the 1994-95 season opener.

Fricke has also worked at Texas Christian University and the University of Nebraska. 

During his coaching tenure at his alma-mater of Nebraska, he was an integral part of the coaching staff that guided the Cornhusker team to  their very first NCAA tournament appearance. During his time with the team they also reached the NIT Final Four, and made the NIT tourney four times.

Fricke will be replacing former assistant coach Beau Archibald, who left the team in the offseason to take an assistant coaching position at his alma mater, the University of  Connecticut

Headline: Men's Soccer: Losing streak extends to five as team drops two in Michigan
Author: Luca Messina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers (0-5-1) dropped two consecutive road games for the second time this season. In what is now a five-game losing streak, FIU lost to No. 18 Michigan Wolverines (6-0) and Michigan State Spartans (5-0) Sept. 14 and 16, respectively, at the Michigan Invitational.

These two games were polar opposites as FIU played Michigan State till the end while struggling against the Michigan powerhouse. 



Michigan St. 1, FIU 0



In what was a defensive struggle, FIU played Michigan State very competitively despite an insignificant offensive effort.

 Junior goalkeeper Kyle Thomas made eight saves and kept the Golden Panthers in the game until second overtime when the Spartans finally broke through.

At the 104th minute, MSU's Raushawn McKenzie netted a shot that was just out of the reach of Thomas' hands, scoring the game's lone tally. 

The Golden Panthers faced two disadvantages throughout the game. 

The Spartans not only outshot FIU 25-16 but at the 68th minute, junior defender Corey Kendall received a red card, which hurt FIU late at a crucial juncture of the game. 

The Spartans are now 5-0 for the first time since 2004 and third time in 31 years under head coach Jim Baum.  



Michigan 5, FIU 1 



The encouraging vibes from the Michigan State loss proved to be insignificant as the University of Michigan pounded the Golden Panthers. 

Sophomore goalkeeper Michael Anderson replaced Thomas and was overwhlemed by the Wolverines' offense. 

FIU couldn't compete early as Michigan's Matt Schmidt netted a header three minutes into the game. 

After that it was all downhill for the Golden Panthers as they trailed 3-0 at the half. A Michigan mistake led to an own goal in the 78th minute which made it 3-1, but they responded only eight seconds later with a goal by Cameron Mich. 

Michigan would add another score at the 88th minute to put the game at 5-1 and even more out of reach. 

The Golden Panhters return home Sept. 21 against the University of Illinois-Chicago at University Park.

Headline: Kansas Notebook: Number one priority against Jayhawks is stopping passing game
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Following last week's loss to the University of Miami, FIU will hope to rebound against yet another tough out of conference opponent, the University of Kansas Jayhawks. 

So far this season, Kansas has burst out of the gate to a 3-0 start, winning all of its games by a combined 139 points. 

The Kansas team is led by quarterback Todd Reesing, who has passed for 831 yards and 10 touchdowns in only three games. 

The Jayhwaks also have a formidable defense that has only allowed 20 points all season.

In order to win, FIU will need to shutdown Reesing's passing attack and find a way to score on the jayhawks defense. A'mod Ned gained 87 rushing yards against UM and will look to put up more big numbers on Kansas. 

"We just have to execute better and practice; that's about it," Ned said following the UM game. "We have to come together as a whole unit and execute better. That's all it is, execution."

Quarterback Wayne Younger will need to use his feet and arm equally well to compete with Ressing offensively.

FIU's next three games against Kansas and Sun Belt Conference rivals Middle Tennessee State and Troy all feature teams with high scoring offenses, so the defense will need to make a statement. 

In FIU's last two games, the defense has played well when faced with a strong and efficient offense. However, both of those offenses relied mainly on their running games, unlike Penn State who passed for almost 300 yards as FIU suffered its worst loss ever in the season opener.

It will all come down to passing at Kansas. The Golden Panthers will need to shut down the Jayhawk's passing game and get their passing game in sync if they are to pull the upset at Kansas.

Headline: Women's Soccer Notebook: Golden Panthers attempt to build on first victory
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
After picking up its first win of the season at home, the women's soccer team (1-1-1) continues its home stand against the Murray State Racers (3-3-0) and Stetson University Hatters (2-2-1) Sept. 21 and 23, respectively.

The team will have a whole week to recover, but they will have only one day of rest between the two games. Due to the team's style of play, the Golden Panthers have to make sure not to wear themselves down in the first game against the Racers' offensive power.

The Racers embarrassed the Bacone College squad with a 9-0 slaughter Sept. 16, that included three goals from freshman midfielder Laken Dirkes. She uses her speed to find open shots and she was the Kentucky State Champion in the 100 meter hurdles in 2005 and 2006. 

Golden Panthers junior midfielder Maria Gualdron wore out Binghamton University Bearcats and will look to neutralize Dirkes' speed with her quickness and stamina. 

Despite the Racers' offensive prowess, they have been shut out three times this season. The Golden Panthers found success against Binghamton by not being overzealous and playing conservatively on defense. If they gamble by attempting to get more steals against the Racers, it will create more opportunities for scorers like Dirkes.

The Hatters are be coming off a 3-0 win against Tennessee Tech Sept. 16 as freshman goalkeeper Andrea Gravaglia recorded her first collegiate shut out. The Golden Panthers offense will try to take advantage of the inexperience of the opposing goalkeeper by pressuring the defenders.

Much like the Racers, the Hatters have one main offensive scoring threat, senior forward Sarah Stock. She has scored half the team's goals this season and has done it by using her ball handling skills and shooting accuracy. FIU defenders and team captains Kristin Hurst and Kia Rigsby will be instrumental in containing Stock.

Hurst's and Rigsby's defense shut down Binghamton after scoring in the first five minutes.  They blocked scoring lanes and cut down Binghamton's time of possession.

FIU coach Thomas Chestnutt finally relieved the pressure of obtaining the first win of the season last week and he will look to continue his winning ways against two offensively gifted clubs.

Headline: Kansas extends Golden Panthers losing streak to 16
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The setting was new but the outcome was all too familiar for Golden Panthers (0-4), whose losing streak extended to a nation long 16 games following a 55-3 loss to the Kansas Jayhawks (4-0) in the team's first visit to Memorial Stadium Sept. 22.

The Jayhawks offense, led by sophomore quarterback Matt Reesing's 368 yards passing and one touchdown, kept the defense guessing with disguised plays, misdirection and trick plays that led to big gains.

The Jayhawks were in control from the outset, blocking a Chris Cook punt from the Golden Panthers' endzone two minutes into the game, which linebacker Dakota Lewis jumped on. 

Following a three and out on offense, the Golden Panther defense bent, allowing a 35-yard pass from Reesing to wide receiver Dexton Fields, but did not break, holding the Jayhawks to a field goal on the following possession.

On the next drive, the Golden Panther offense showed signs of life, moving the ball into Kansas territory on two big plays from wide receivers Jason Frierson and Kendall Berry . Despite flashes of success, they were forced to settle for a 42-yard field goal from place kicker Chris Abed, the first points the Golden Panthers scored in the first quarter all season.

The Golden Panthers failed to take advantage of numerous opportunities throughout the first half, as Jayhawks running back Brandon McAnderson lost two fumbles during the first quarter only to have Golden Panther's running back A'Mod Ned give the ball right back on a fumble on the following drive each time.

Despite some flashes of success in the first quarter, the offense faltered from then on, gaining just 149 yards of total offense in the first half, following 90 in the first quarter.

Sophomore quarterback Wayne Younger showed flashes of why he was chosen as the starter at the beginning of the season, as he gained 58 yards on the ground and a career-high 133 through the air. 

However, he missed numerous open receivers and showed very little accuracy on downfield passes, overthrowing receivers on several occasions. He was replaced by freshman Colt Anderson in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, who threw his first career pass, an incompletion to wide receiver Torrelt Solomon.

The Golden Panthers defense, which had been strong this season, despite allowing the occasional big play, gave up 338 yards in the first half alone.

Despite these struggles, the defense only allowed one touchdown during the first half, and the teams went into the locker room with the Jayhawks leading 20-3. 

The struggles continued on both sides of the ball in the second half, as the Golden Panther offense finished with less than 300 yards of total offense, and were more than doubled by the potent Kansas offense. 

The Golden Panthers dropped to 0-16 as a Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) football team. They take on the Middle Tennessee State University Blue Raiders (0-4) next in Murfreesboro , Tennessee , on Sept. 29.
