This is an email that I've just sent to the UTS support center. I hope that you could do a story about the ongoing network problems. I'd prefer not to have this letter be in any published documents if you do decide to do the story. Thank you.

Sincerely,

There was a memo earlier this year, I believe that it was released in February. It was about increasing the bandwidth of the seriously congested FIU pipeline. In that memo it was stated that measures were being taken and that sometime in February (I'm not sure on the months) that we, the users of the campus network would experience a 40% increase in bandwidth which would further be increased to 60% by mid March. 

I don't see any changes in fact the internet lag is much worse than before. I've used the FIUnet Utilization since summer 2002 and there is a dramatic increase in network activity. Is anything being done about this? Were the plans scrapped?


p.s. I used to use my FIU email to send most of my personal mail because it was usually much faster since the new dorms came online but it's not lately.

Dear Beacon:
This letter is directed to the entire editorial board. It is the responsibility of you all to make certain that all articles, captions, headings, pictures, etc. follow ethical guidelines of journalistic writing. After 7 years of journalism experience, it is utterly dissappointing and disgruntling to have come across the picture (1B) and caption  on this Tuesday's front page. Upon endorsing a political candidate, it is their duty to refrain from defamizing the character of their running opponent. The picture of Ana Manrara expresses an emotional and personal moment which should not have been exploited by this newspaper. Post-elections, comments on Clayton's victory and reactions from Jorge's campaign are certainly acceptable. Yet, you have destroyed the image of what a university publication is supposed to uphold. University publications should not be at the hands of political opportunists, who build their support on the basis of defamation. The focus of this and any publication is to report actions, reactions and points of view. Certainly, it is not purposed to emphasize and mock the defeat of any one of its readers. I believe that this publication forgot that those who worked and voted for Jorge and Ana make up a significant portion of its audience. At this point, I can assure you that much of that audience has been lost at the disgusting and childish tactics undertaken by whomever proposed and allowed such a picutre to be published. If our school journalists cannot exalt the foundations of reporting ethic, then what credibility can we expect to gain from further publications? 

An upset reader

Headline: Defense beats offense 24-21 in first spring football scrimmage
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The FIU offense got off to a  solid start in the first half of the first spring scrimmage behind the rushing of junior Rashod Smith, who put together 61 yards on four carries and a touchdown. His longest run of the afternoon went for 64 yards. 

But it was a different story in the second half of the 69-play scrimmage as the defense held the offense scoreless to secure a 24-21 win on Saturday morning.

Gentry Jackson led the defenders with seven tackles. Josh Alexander, Payton Williams and Chris Horne each had one sack.  Gerrod Bodie and Derrick Kuilan had six tackles each.

"We played our starting offense in the first half and they played well," said Head Coach Don Strock. "In the second half, we brought in our second units on both sides and there were a lot of mistakes. But overall, I was pleased with the effort. Everybody got a chance to play and they came out and played hard."

The offense had five series and scored three times in the first half behind the signal calling of quarterbacks David Tabor, last season's backup, and Josh Padrick, who is seeing a lot more action after running the scout team in 2002.

Jamie Burke, last seasons starter, did not participate in the scrimmage in order to rest his surgically-repaired shoulder.

Tabor struggled going 6-for-16 for 49 yards but he did connect with sophomore Harold Leath for the lone passing touchdown of the afternoon.

Padrick went 9-of-15 for 66 yards and rushed for 13. His longest run of the day gained 20 yards on a fourth down and six.

Neither quarterback threw an interception.

"[Padrick] might be the most talented of the three quarterbacks we have. Both guys played well for the most part, but they need to improve their consistency if we're gonna win games this season," Strock said.

The rushing attack grinded out 165 yards. Sophomore Tori Robinson ran for 34 yards on eight carries. It was the first significant action Robinson has seen after a disappointing 2002 campaign which saw the Southride High School alumnus suffer from a nagging ankle injury. 

"We ran very well the entire day and probably could've gained even more yards," Strock said. "I'm very pleased that a lot of the guys like [Robinson] who missed time last year got the chance to play."

Smith opened up the scoring after he ran the ball in from one yard out to give the offense a 7-3 lead. The score was set up by Smith's own 64-yard breakaway run.

Padrick came out hot, completing his first four passes. OJ Price ran in a touchdown off a Padrick handoff to give the offense a 21-6 lead at intermission. 

The defense then stopped the offense on the next six series to earn the victory.  

"I expected the defense to play well earlier," said Strock. "We need more consistency. But there's no question that we have a good nucleus of players here. Every day we seem to be getting a bit more mature and they're beginning to better understand the system we're trying to implement. All this will make us better competitively next season."

FIU returns to the practice field on Monday and concludes the spring practice period with the Blue/Gold  Scrimmage Saturday April 12 at 10:00 a.m. Community Stadium.

Headline: Baseball wins two of three road games
Author: Steve Perhla / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers traveled to Murfreesboro, Tenn. this weekend, taking two of three games from conference foe Middle Tennessee State University, improving to 27-10 on the season.


FIU 11, MTSU 7


Despite allowing 16 hits, the Golden Panthers were able to muster a 15-hit, 11-run performance, out-slugging the Blue Raiders of Middle Tenn. State 11-7 Friday night.

Junior pitcher Josh Banks pitched well enough to earn his team-leading sixth victory of the season, going 7.1 innings, allowing six earned runs and striking out nine.

FIU was led offensively by freshman right fielder Yahmed Yema who blasted two homeruns and scored three times.

The Golden Panthers wasted no time getting the bats cooking in the first inning. Shortstop Luis Rivera singled and first baseman Mike Lopez was hit by the pitch. Freshman Bryan Pullin (2-for-4, three RBI) followed with a RBI single to right center, giving FIU the early 1-0 lead. Center fielder Ricardo Nanita (2-for-4, two RBI) made it 2-0 with a sacrifice fly to left. 

Pullin knocked home Rivera again in the third on a fielder's choice, expanding the lead to three. 

Leading 4-2 entering the fifth, the Golden Panther onslaught continued. Pullin drove in Rivera for the third time with a single up the middle. Nanita then doubled home Pullin, putting FIU ahead 6-2. After Yema walked, catcher Michael New hit a two-run double, giving the Panthers an 8-2 advantage after five. 

Banks (6-1) ran into some trouble in the eighth, by allowing four runs, but solid pitching by freshman Edgar Ramirez in the ninth, as well as homeruns in the seventh and ninth inning by Yema, helped preserve the FIU victory.


MTSU 6, FIU 4


Middle Tenn. State pitcher John Williams quieted the FIU offense, pitching a complete game, as the Blue Raiders edged the Golden Panthers 6-4 Saturday afternoon.

Trailing 2-0 entering the fourth, FIU finally got on the scoreboard when Skip Adams scored on a throwing error on a Dennis Diaz single, cutting the lead to 2-1.

The Golden Panthers tied the game in the sixth on a RBI single by Ricardo Nanita. 

But FIU starter Luis Gazitua ran into trouble in the bottom of the inning, giving up two separate two-run jacks to Brett Carroll and Shane Kemp, reclaiming the lead for the Blue Raiders 6-2. 

The Golden Panthers gathered some momentum when ace Derek DeCarlo, in a rare relief role, struck out the first two batters he faced and retired the side in the seventh.

The FIU offense responded in the eighth when Luis Rivera scored on a throwing error by MTSU right fielder Marcus Taylor, narrowing the deficit to 6-3.

Needing three runs to tie, the Panthers were unable to take advantage of DeCarlo's scoreless relief, adding only one more run in the ninth when Diaz scored on another MTSU error.

Gazitua (1-1), who struck out five in five innings, took the loss for FIU. DeCarlo struck out five in three innings in relief for FIU.

Williams (2-2) finished with seven strikeouts, while allowing only one earned run as the winner for Middle Tenn. State.


FIU 12, MTSU 0


The Golden Panthers, led by junior starter Arthur Santos and junior center fielder Ricardo Nanita, put the Sun-Belt Conference 10-run mercy rule into effect, pummeling MTSU 12-0 in only eight innings Sunday afternoon.

Santos (1-5) played his best game of the season, pitching eight scoreless innings, giving up only six scattered hits, while striking-out a team season-high 13 batters.

The FIU offensive attack got right to work early in the first inning, pounding out five runs right off the bat. First baseman got things started with a single to left field. DH James Bacon followed that up with a double to left. Nanita (3-for-4, four RBI) then knocked both baserunners home with a two-run double, putting FIU ahead 2-0. Yahmed Yema (3-5, three runs, two RBI) then doubled home Nanita, increasing the lead to 3-0. Left fielder Fernando Alvarez was struck by the pitch, and Michael New (2-for-4, two RBI) drilled a two-run triple right field, expanding the early jumpstart to 5-0.

However, the Golden Panthers didn't stop there, adding runs the next three consecutive innings. Nanita doubled home Lopez in the second inning, making the score 6-0. Yema made it 7-0 in the third when he scored on a wild pitch. Skip Adams (2-for-5, RBI) kept it going in the fourth with a RBI double of his own, giving FIU a comfortable eight run lead.

FIU decided to add some insurance, nailing four more runs to the scoreboard in the eighth, giving themselves a 12-0 advantage. 

Santos would shut the door on the Blue Raiders in the bottom of the eighth, forcing the umpires to call the game due to the Sun-Belt Conference's 10-run mercy rule.



Up Next for FIU



The Golden Panthers head to Daytona Wednesday, April 9 for a two-game series with rival Bethune-Cookman College. 

The Golden Panthers are looking for revenge after losing two of three to the Wildcats at home in late February in a series highlighted by several hit batters and a bench-clearing brawl. 

FIU catcher Michael New, who referred to B-CC as a "bush-league team" back in February, said, "It's a good rivalry, [but] we shouldn't lose to them again." FIU's two losses to B-CC were decided by a combined three runs.

After the B-CC series, the Golden Panthers (27-10, 6-3 Sun-Belt) get ready for a March 16 home showdown against the seventh-ranked, cross-town rival Miami Hurricanes (23-4) at University Park. 

A large home crowd is expected to be on hand, after FIU fell earlier this season to the Canes 12-7 in Coral Gables in another contest involving a bench-clearing fight.

In game two, Amanda Neeler (15-6) won her eighth-straight outing, limiting NMSU to three hits in a complete game.

FIU returns to Miami to host St. Thomas (Fla.) in a doubleheader on Friday, April 11 at 6:00 p.m.


FIU 13, NMSU 2


Gill hit her first career grand slam as the Golden Panthers knocked off NMSU, 13-2, in a game that was called after five innings.

The 13 runs were the most scored by FIU this season.

The Golden Panthers were hot at the plate with nine hits. 

The team took advantage of five Aggie errors to increase their lead. 

Owens went 2-for-4 with three RBI. Nicole Dubovik was 1-for-1 with three RBI and three walks.

Laminack (7-7) pitched four innings, allowing three hits and striking out four. 

Nicole Barrett came in relief to preserve the win.


FIU 2, NMSU 1


FIU pitcher Amanda Nealer (14-6) pitched her seventh consecutive win as she held the Aggies to four hits in seven innings.

 FIU broke a scoreless tie in the fourth inning. Lindsay Tippings' double to left field brought home Marleah Stapf. Gill was walked with the bases loaded to score Tippings.

Jennifer Bride hit a home run to bring the Aggies within a run. Nealer recovered to end the game with three strikeouts. 

Bride pitched a complete game, but dropped her record to 7-16 on the year.

Subheadline: World fears United States, not Saddam Hussein
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

This war, I hope, is just a bad dream. 

Our country, once the emblem of freedom throughout the world, has now become the antithesis of that concept. 

Not only are our enemies scared to death of us, but so are our allies. 

The current White House administration has taken our nation over the top and into the pits of fire, all in the name of freedom and liberty.

As we "liberate" Iraq, I wonder if any Iraqi civilians will be able to take part in that liberation after the war is over, as U.S. and British bombs continue to decimate civilians in an attempt to free them from their oppression. 

At last count, "coalition" forces have killed over 700 Iraqi civilians.

President George W. Bush has sent in our troops to fight this war, and as soon as they left the House of Representatives passed a bill that would cut $25 billion over the next 10 years from veteran's health care and benefits programs.

Our president asserts that Iraq has defied the United Nations for too long and must be "disarmed." 

Meanwhile our country has gone against the U.N. Charter and declared an illegal war against Iraq in defiance of the U.N. Security Council.

Osama bin Laden has still not been captured.

The Middle East and its people continue to loathe our country, as the breeding grounds for terrorist organizations are receiving more and more applicants to carry out attacks against U.S. interests and institutions. 

Most nations of the world and their citizens are against this war. Even the populations of "coalition of the willing" countries such as Britain and Spain, had over 80 percent of their people against the war.

65 percent of Americans cannot find Iraq on a map.

I hope Iraq does not look anything like Afghanistan after this war is over. 

Did you forget already? 

Afghanistan is the other country we "liberated," where more innocent civilians died during the U.S. campaign there than died on Sept. 11. I assume that justifies everything.

North Korea has nuclear weapons. Iraq never did.

Hamas, the now famous Palestinian terrorist organization, has never as much as spit in the direction of America, yet it is on top of the list of terrorist organizations the United States is set to take out. 

Why? Ask Israel.

Our country is not making any friends in the Middle East with this war, but is only exacerbating the rifts. 

All for the sake of one small "ally" who receives over $4 billion in aid a year from the United States.

Contradictions are in abundance as this war takes place. 

The moral high ground our country sat on after Sept. 11 has been swept away, and now it is we, not the evil terrorists, who the world fears.

Headline: Western cultural ideals will transform Iraq
Author: Hsin-Nan Wu / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
As the occupation of the Iraq begins we will transform the region through a series of "Shock and Awe."

We will Shock and Awe the region with our female equality. Our female officers will prove to them that women can be as capable as men. We will prove that women with freedom of choice (between the prospect of career and housewife) do not necessarily become "bad" women. And, women who maximize their potential will contribute more to the society in general. 

Simultaneously, our male soldiers will show the locals that there is no need to fear empowered women. Men who show deference and respect to women are still men.

We will Shock and Awe the region with our religious diversity. Our soldiers, a reflection of our society, will compose of people from different ethnicity and religious faith. 

Regardless of our personal beliefs (there could be a Chinese Baptist, an Anglo Buddhist, or a Hispanic Muslim), our soldiers will show tolerance and work together. 

We will respect one another's differences instead of engaging in endless bickering or infighting over trivial spiritual divergence.  

We will Shock and Awe the region with our work ethic. Americans have always been known to be wealthy but such wealth is built upon hard work and a system of fair play known as capitalism. 

American workers will be out in the field sweating to earn their paycheck alongside their Arabic colleague. Those who work hard will be justly rewarded for their labor and those who show initiative and ingenuity will move up the ladder without regard to their sex, ethnicity and religious beliefs.

We will Shock and Awe the region with our idea of fun. Many people are pessimistic about the idea of changing the fundamental nature of the people in general, but it can be done. 

The reward of abstract martyrdom will pale when compared to the palpable and realizable material comforts of secularism. 

Over the years, maybe a generation or less, we will influence them with our consumerism and pop culture. 

The offspring of the cold-blooded Nazis and the austere Samurai are now the strongest advocates of peace and some of the wildest party animals ever. China, the land once known for its monotonous blue jacket masses, is now trying hard to catch up to the bourgeoisie life that it once spurned. In December 1998, Ricky Martin stopped in China for his world tour.

 A full stadium of hysterical Chinese women screamed and shouted whenever the Puerto Rican heartthrob wiggled his signature posterior. Under the spell of the subliminal marketing, those conservative and mild-mannered ladies of the Far East behave no different than the crazy teens of the United States. 

The Arab people, as any other people, will succumb as well. They will prefer hanging out at the malls to discuss the latest tabloid rather than hiding in a cave to plan for world destruction. 

There may still be people like Osama around. Anti-social weirdos like those will be shunned and their message of sacrifice will be ridiculed as they perish away either through capture or through suicide missions. 

Conservative clergies will find that their audiences dwindle as people become increasingly occupied with mundane responsibilities of work and family. As the idea of democracy becomes more prevalent, people will demand more accountability of those alleged godly leaders. Leaders who fail to deliver economic prosperity will be rejected and replaced by those who will.

Trinity of our modern society (Capitalism, Secularism and Democracy) will prevail over the fanatic Middle Age theocracy.  Eventually, they will be just like us.

Headline: War is started, turn your attention to the future
Author: Andy Diaz / Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
I wanted - wanted is perhaps not strong enough a verb, if I wasn't such a dogmatic atheist I might go so far as to use "prayed" - nothing more than for those first wily tomahawks to live up to their moniker and obliterate their intended target. 

There was an ephemeral picture in my head of Saddam meeting with his subordinates, all wearing wolfish grins, right before the million-dollar missile did the deed. 

It would have been better that way. It would have saved us President Bush's exaggerated and spurious-looking salutes every time he addresses the troops (you'd think that a man who fought so bravely in the Texas National Guard during the Vietnam war to keep the Viet Cong out of Dallas would be able to manage a legit salute), the briefings from the Pentagon by the insufferable Secretary Rumsfeld and those never-ending segments on CNN of an ex-general with a pointer standing over a map of Iraq.

But Saddam outsmarted the smart bombs and survived, or so we think. 

Now, I sit in front of my television and cheer the American troops (and the British) on their ravenous dash into Baghdad. 

I use the word ravenous with the most positive of connotations in this instance, and let me prove it; I too am equally ravenous.

I despise all forms of tyranny, oppression and non-democracy. This is nothing original, I would hope that everyone reading this column feels the same way. 

But this is why I hate Saddam, the whole ruling family (what a cute name for an oligarchy) of Saudi Arabia and to a degree, John Ashcroft. 

But more importantly, this is why, now that this ill-conceived, and certainly ill-executed, war has started, I can't help but feel that at least one of the outcomes (which outweighs all other possible ones) - the removal of Saddam Hussein from power - will be beneficial to the Iraqi people and the world.

I staunchly opposed the war in Iraq, and in a way, I still do. I believe, to quote those chanting peaceniks who amuse me so, it is a war for oil. This doesn't bother me too much since I'd rather see Iraq's oil in the hands of the Bushites than in the hands of Saddam's military junta. 

Furthermore, I'll gladly watch as a post-Saddam Iraq helps destabilize the Saudi's oil monopoly. 

I opposed the war on slightly different grounds. I opposed the war because the whole world opposed the war, except of course for Bush's laughable "coalition of the willing" - whatever that means. 

This coalition is comprised of otherwise irrelevant poor countries like Afghanistan, Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia that wait open-beaked for American monetary magnanimity as reward for their membership in our ludicrous coalition. (There was a running Internet joke a couple of weeks ago proclaiming that five more countries had announced they were joining the coalition: Barsoom, Gondor, Ruri, Narnia and Cardassia.)

The war was also ingenuously untimely. The resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian is a worthier and more urgent cause and yet all the attention it got was an incomprehensible and obviously rushed so-called "road map" to peace, or as The Guardian's Brian Whitaker referred to it, a "little charade... contrived purely to help Mr. Blair by addressing the question of double standards in relation to Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict." 

The "road map" worked as a great smoke screen for that gluttonous fat bastard Sharon, who has lately started offering the idea of creating a temporary Palestinian state with no set borders as though it were a worthy offer, and certainly not offensive, to the Palestinians.

As is the case at home, the Bush Administration decided to disregard world opinion and the rule of law and do as it pleased. The war would also kill more people than Saddam, properly supervised of course, could. 

There was also one more danger that wasn't much discussed, if at all, in the American media: the fact that the majority of the Shi'a in the south, unlike the Kurds in the south, showed no sign of being interested in a secular form of government and most of them followed an Ayatollah of sorts. 

The fighting in the south of Iraq during the first week of the war proved me right. The Shi'a Muslims despise Saddam, and why shouldn't they, since he slaughtered hundreds of them after the first Gulf War? But they're equally resistant to the American forces.

For better or for worse (let's hope for the former), it has happened. Bush took that misguided step, shunning the stability the Western world has striven for in the past fifty years and gone ahead with his self-serving plans. 

There is no point in protesting the war anymore because it has already started, because it won't stop until Saddam has been deposed, and most importantly because the removal of Saddam Hussein from power is ultimately a good cause. 

We should be concentrating on Bush's ulterior motives: like the administration's shameless appointment of Halliburton, the company that Vice President Chaney headed, to the task of cleaning the oil fields; like Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz's intentions to keep Iraq ruled by the American military for over six months; like the White House's commitment to reconstruct Iraq without the help of the United Nations. 

But that's another column entirely.

Headline: But seriously folks, FIU is the best
Author: John Colagrande Jr. / Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
FIU represents.

We are the best school in Florida. 

No question. No doubt.

Take pride in FIU. 

U.S. News & World Report ranked us among the top 100 public national universities in America. 

We are one of the top 10 public commuter universities in the nation as well as the country's 18th best value in public higher education.

Our Creative Writing Program is ranked among the top-10 creative writing programs in the country and our School of Hospitality Management is recognized as one of the nation's top-five hospitality management programs. 

FIU represents and that needs to be recognized.

The best part is we're humble. We don't come off like we're the best school in Florida but we are the best school in Florida. 

We're not like those Gators who walk around with their heads held high acting like there's an extra element in the Gainesville air that magically makes them better than everyone else. 

Why do UF students think they're special? What, God lives in a Central Florida swamp?  

Seems like every kid I disliked in high school goes to school in Gainesville.   

UF: FU.

UCF: tell Mickey that he's not funny, besides, U Can't Finish.

FAU: is there a cosmetology school? The campus is in Boca. Find Another University.

USF: even though Tampa won the Super Bowl, U Still Fail.

And we're not like the Seminoles who call themselves Florida State. 

What state are they in? They're in an intoxicated state, that's for sure, with all the partying that goes on up there. 

But what else is there to do? They're in the middle of nowhere. 

Tallahassee is so far away from the rest of Florida that the Seminoles should be referred to as Near Alabama State, or Bible Belt State, or Red neck State.

There is more to attending a school than curriculum and cost. There is lifestyle.

We live in Miami. That is a huge advantage. Miami is a city. Miami is an international hot spot. 

There wasn't a hit show starring Don Johnson called "Tampa Vice."

There is no "CSI: Tallahassee." Will Smith did not sing "Welcome to Orlando, Bienvenido a Orlando." 

Students from all the other Florida schools flock to Miami during Spring Break. 

They feel that Miami is a whole different world and if they 'venture' down to crazy ol' Miami it's like discovering some uncharted territory. 

Well, Miami is another world compared to the rest of Florida because Miami is a city. 

And as a city we are plugged into the rest of the world, plugged into other cities. 

There is of course another school in Miami. 

It's pretty popular, too. 

In fact, its shadow is so big that it sort of eclipses our image. You may have heard of them. They have,  like, the number one football team in the country every year. 

The problem is a Bachelor's degree from that school costs one hundred thousand dollars. 

That's kind of a lot, wouldn't you say, compared to FIU? 

With a Pell Grant you can actually get paid to go to FIU. Besides, last time I checked, over there, one plus one still equaled two. 

You go to UM and you'll be scratching your head like, "Um, I need to call an accountant."   

Luckily, FIU graduate students rank first in the nation in passing the CPA exam on the first try, for all those UM students who need help with their finances.

There is much about this year's student government elections to be contented with.  

Biscayne Bay Campus and University Park both registered record high voting numbers. There was nary a shred of controversy, as candidates conducted some of the cleanest campaigning seen in years. For the first time, voting was conducted electronically, a departure from the older and more controversial punch card system.

But something was definitely missing: candidates.

At UP, seven candidates ran for office unopposed, while two other positions, College of Business and College of Education representatives, remain empty.

At BBC one office was taken unopposed, and a whopping seven offices, College of Business, Arts and Sciences, Journalism and Mass Communications, School of Nursing, Housing, Broward, as well as a representative at large position, remain vacant.

These offices will be temporarily filled for the summer by a council-appointed representatives, pending fall special elections.

It is great that students participated by voting, but it is necessary that students also participate by taking on these leadership roles.

Being able to choose the strongest candidate from a list of many allows the interests of the student body to be more strongly represented.

This lack of participation robs us all of that opportunity.

Headline: Groove Phi Groove helps foster children
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
With its recent inductment into the Student Organizations Council, the Golden Panther Chapter of Groove Phi Groove is already undertaking its first major project: taking foster children to see two Miami Heat games. 

On April 8, Groove Phi Groove members will be taking a group of 14 foster children from Miami River of Life and Dahlia&#8217;s Foster Home For Children to see the Miami Heat play the Toronto Raptors.  Groove Phi Groove took seven teenagers from Miami River of Life to see the March 28 game, where the teens got free Miami Heat souvenirs and had an opportunity to meet Miami Heat player Alonzo Mourning.

The Miami Heat donated 50 tickets for these trips and Groove Phi Groove paid for refreshments for the children.

Groove Phi Groove President Leon Delsol, a junior, said taking the kids to these games &#8220;keeps the fire in their eyes.&#8221; 

&#8220;Heat players are role models to them,&#8221; Delsol added.

Eighteen-year-old Christopher Evans is one of the teenagers who went with Groove Phi Groove to the March 28 game.  He thinks the outings will be beneficial for the children, especially the younger ones, because, he said, it will show them that Groove Phi Groove members care about them.

&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a good influence and help with [the kids&#8217;] behavior by showing them someone cares about them,&#8221; Evans said.

Miami River of Life has different programs for at-risk youth, including Dade Group Treatment Home in Homestead, which aims to teach youth responsibility and social and life skills, amongst other things.

Groove Phi Groove members visit the children at Miami River of Life at least twice a month.  They spend time with the children (who are between the ages of 10 and 18), throw barbeques, play basketball and sometimes donate items (such as a television and Christmas tree) to them.  But members say the most important thing they do is talk and listen to the kids, offering them guidance, encouraging them to go to college and stay away from drugs and alcohol.

&#8220;When I was younger, a lot of people didn&#8217;t really have a direction in life,&#8221; Christopher Channer, Groove Phi Groove vice president said. &#8220;Now that I&#8217;m older, I wanted to help others who might not have that motivation.  It&#8217;s good when we start with them when they&#8217;re younger &#8216;cause they still have a chance to change their lives.&#8221;

Groove Phi Groove is not a fraternity, but rather a social fellowship organization for black men.  The goal of the organization is to promote ethics, leadership, academic awareness, unity and the well-being of mankind.

The Golden Panther Chapter is the first undergraduate chapter of the organization in Florida. Co-founders Delsol and Channer worked with Groove Phi Groove&#8217;s Greater Miami Graduate Chapter before establishing this chapter at FIU.

Currently, the Golden Panther Chapter has 10 members, including five women who they refer to as &#8220;gems.&#8221; The women assist with events and provide a female perspective during discussions with the children, according to Delsol.

And so far the children&#8217;s response to Groove Phi Groove&#8217;s visits has been good.

&#8220;The kids love it,&#8221; Delsol said. &#8220;They can&#8217;t wait to see us.&#8221;

Evans appreciates Groove Phi Groove&#8217;s involvement with the kids at Miami River of Life and thinks it has had a positive influence.

&#8220;It&#8217;s been motivational,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They help take a lot of youth off the street.&#8221;

Delsol and Channer referred to Evans as one of their &#8220;success stories.&#8221; Evans is a senior at South Dade High School and he plans to study Computer Science at FIU after he graduates.

Other teenagers at Miami River of Life have also benefited from Groove Phi Groove&#8217;s involvement.

Jose, 15, said he enjoys when Groove Phi Groove members visit Miami River of Life, and he has learned important lessons from them.

&#8220;They help us not to smoke weed and do drugs and drink,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;You could die off of that.&#8221;

Above all, Groove Phi Groove members act as motivation for the kids. The main message they try to get across to them is that they can do anything they put their minds to, according to Delsol.

&#8220;It makes me feel good &#8216;cause I know I&#8217;m doing something positive,&#8221; Delsol said.

But the biggest reward of working with the children, Delsol said, is simply &#8220;putting a smile on their faces.&#8221;

Headline: Communications week brings professional journalists to BBC
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Communications Week kicked off April 7 with a keynote address from Brooks Jackson, a national CNN correspondent and investigative reporter.  Also held was a "Celebration of Life" ceremony honoring the memory of advertising and public relations professor, William C. Adams, who passed away unexpectedly on March 13.

The theme of this week's four-day event is "A Crisis in Confidence: The Role of Communicators."  According to Catherine Ahles, professor of advertising and public relations, Communications Week will be centered on discussions dealing with the negative aspects of the business world and how those in the journalism and public relations industries respond to them.  

The School of Journalism and Mass Communication has arranged a wide array of events including panels of professionals in the journalism and communication fields that will be visiting classes for the next two days.

According to Mike McQueen, chairperson of the journalism/broadcasting department, Communications Week gives students an opportunity to become better oriented with their fields of study by giving them the chance to hear from professionals.

"Journalism as a field is extremely professionally oriented," said McQueen.  "Newspaper people, and public relations people and advertising people are very busy. [Students] wouldn't be able to call up an agency and say 'I want to spend two days talking to your people.'  Communications week serves the purpose of focusing attention on the different fields."  

A highlight of the week will be the CEO breakfast, where business professionals will openly debate some of the issues brought up throughout the week.  Among them is Marilyn Laurie, former senior vice president of Communications at AT&T who was recently admitted in the Arthur W. Page Society Hall of Fame. The breakfast is scheduled for April 10 at 9:00 a.m. in the Kovens Center.  

J. Arthur Heise, SJMC dean, is looking forward to the upcoming week and is certain that the events planned will prove worthwhile to all of those who attend.

"I think ... any student, whether Public relations, journalism - anybody, will find some really interesting people who will be addressing some really interesting questions," said Heise.

Students of all majors are encouraged to reap the benefits of Communications Week.

"It's a chance for students to learn a lot more about the issues in the field and about their professions and kind of get outside of the strict content of the classes they're sitting in," Ahles said.  "We're hoping to give the students and members of the community a very concentrated opportunity to hear some top-notch speakers."  
Communications Week will close with the SJMC's 12th annual Student Celebration and Awards Ceremony featuring Marilyn Laurie as a keynote speaker.  The ceremony will take place on April 10, at 5:00 p.m. in the Kovens Center.

Headline: Insufficient lighting at both  campuses unnerves students
Author: Jennifer Camille/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Distant walks to their cars through dark parking lots at the Biscayne Bay and University Park campuses have some students and staff concerned about their safety. 

"It would be nice to have more visible security at the campus and more lights in the parking lots," senior Jenny Devereaux said. 

Students are requesting more visible security and the administration agrees this issue is important. 

"We understand how important it is for everyone to feel safe when they are walking to their cars at night," Brian Bitar, assistant director of Facilities Operations, said. 

Additional lighting has recently been placed at various locations of each campus, but BBC will be getting even more lights. 

The walkway from housing to the physical plant, from the library to the WUC, and from housing to the library had lights installed, according to Bitar.

 Still, Bitar said "paved areas are all covered by lighting but unpaved areas such as the dirt road that begins from the back of ACII to the Kovens Conference Center are not." 

Installing more lighting is the aim of Facilities Operations staff. 

"In the future we are planning to put more 12- foot light poles from the walkway that starts at the physical plant all the way to the KCC, and next month we plan to put two more poles in front of the library," Maintenance Supervisor Vladimir Shpurik said. "Each pole costs about $1500 because they are very good structures that last a long time and they are from Belgium, so we are working on that now. We get lights that have high watts and will not hurt people's eyes." 

Inadequate maintenance can also lead to insufficient lighting.

"Sometimes we have lights that burn out and that may give the impression that there are no lights around; [But] we have a pretty good lighting maintenance," Bitar said. "We also encourage anyone that feels unsafe or has any suggestions to feel free to come see us, and we would be more than happy to do a walk through with them so they could point out the problems." 

Many students attend late-night classes at both UP and BBC so security becomes a concern for them. Also, some students feel safer at one campus than at the other.

"I have a class that ends at 10:30 p.m. at  BBC and the darkness does not bother me. I used to have night classes at the University Park campus and I feel much more unsafe there then at the BBC," senior Melissa Gomez said. 

"At the UP campus it gets really dark, the parking lots are far away from the school and I only see a few people around." 

BBC has four parking lots. There is one in front of the library with faculty, staff and metered parking. Lots 2, 3 and 4 are mainly metered and student parking and are located next to the Academic II building. UP has 12 parking lots and two garages, with two more garages in the works.  

Placing more lights around the dark parking lots in both campuses is an important issue to staff as well as students. 

"I work in the Wolfe University Center and I have left [BBC] many times in the late night and the farther you get away from the library the darker it is," William Martinez, custodial supervisor, said. "It is especially important to add more lights for our guests and female students as they walk toward their cars at night." 

Public Safety officials are taking security measures to ensure the sense of security of students, faculty, staff and guests.  

"We have a 24-hour police escort service that is here to make sure that students feel safe," FIU police officer Pamela Turner said. 

Other security measures are in place as well.

"As additional security, we have 24-hour cameras, security lights, emergency phones and additional public safety officials on duty working all over on both campuses," FIU police officer D.A. Pitts, said.  

There are always at least two FIU police officers on duty and they make rounds at UP and BBC, according to Turner. Turner said that although she has not personally received any complaints about lighting from students, Public Safety should heed students' concerns.

"We cater to the students, and if they feel there should be more lights, it is worth doing," Turner said, "Surveys and drive-throughs in areas that need additional attention should be done." 

Public Safety warns students to take extra precautions when they are on campus at night.  

"At night students should stay in groups, call our 24-hour public safety escort officers and be aware of their surroundings," Pitts said.

Headline: Marketing internship gives students experience, credit
Author: Tony Metzelar / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU, in partnership with EdVenture Partners and General Motors, is now offering business students an on-campus internship in which they can obtain college credit hours while attaining hands-on business experience. 

The General Motors Marketing Internship was approved by John Nichols, the chairperson of the Marketing Department, and brought to FIU as a course for the first time this spring.  

"We encourage the students to take internships, so with this course, they can put into effect what they learn into a classroom setting as they would in a real world setting," Nichols said.  This course will be offered only in the spring.

 EdVenture Partners is a California-based company that specializes in developing industrial-educational partnerships to provide one-of-a-kind educational value to students and educators, while reciprocally providing clients with marketing and recruiting access to campuses across the country.  

 GMMI has sponsored and participated in such programs in more than 350 campuses nationwide.  

According to Professor Tim Dugan, the program was completed by the American Marketing Association members before it was offered as a course at FIU.  It was entirely voluntary to these members.  

"Overall, the events were a success, however, Henry Martell, our client (owner of Martell Buick Pontiac-GMC), and our partner Karin Fonte from EdVenture Partners, thought it was best if this was run as a class.  Since so much work is involved, the only way to help ensure success is to have students accountable by receiving a grade for their work," Dugan said. 

This semester Dugan, who is also an advisor of the American Marketing Association, said there were 40 people fully participant in every aspect of the event, compared to 10 fully active students in the past.

The class selected ADimpressions as the company name of their in-house agency that specializes in building the awareness - not sales - of its clients and products.  According to Dugan and Fonte, having their own company name makes the process more professional to their dealer than GMMI, the course title.

 The culmination of ADimpressions' 16 weeks of work is an interactive event aimed at increasing awareness for Pontiac vehicles in Miami. They named it "Spring Break 2 -The Extreme Getaway" because it will be presented after FIU students come back from their regular Spring Break on April 10.  This event will take place on the University Park's Graham Center lawn.

It will have many free giveaways such as food, water from Zephyrhills, prizes, $50 gift certificates, massages, makeovers,  facials, and a $4,000 voucher provided by this agency, with the authorization of the dealer, Martell, and much more.

The class agency, ADimpressions, prepared for a real presentation done in class before the Pontiac people.  They explored their target market and presented their strategic plan to the representatives of Pontiac General Motors in an agency-style presentation.

To get each of the 40 students involved as much as possible in every decision, just like in a real agency, students were "hired" or placed in six groups.  Each group or department had a leader or coordinator and was responsible for various goals/objectives.  Their responsibilities were divided into researching, implementing and raising funds and evaluating a promotional campaign for their client, The Pontiac Division of General Motors in Miami.

Victor Rodriguez is the on-campus coordinator.  Each of the department coordinators would report to him.

"I actually had quite a big job," Rodriguez, senior, marketing and management, said.  "I would highly recommend this class to all FIU students, but especially to students in the College of Business.  This class actually puts you in those real-life situations.  And in the environment [the students] learn to deal with the consequences of their decisions."

"The GMMI project has been an excellent opportunity for me to be able to express my creative side," Monica Cadena, senior and Marketing Major, said, "and at the same time strengthen my leadership skills."  As Advertising Coordinator, Cadena was responsible for allocating money, working closely with the budget coordinator, to advertising in the most in the most efficient way possible.

"'Spring Break 2' will be an exciting event to attend because besides all the fun filled activities we have scheduled for the day, food and music, there will be amazing cars that are going to be displayed so that students can look and become more knowledgeable about them," Cadena said.  

"This is a great opportunity that's been brought to everyone at FIU," said Constanza Traub, senior, marketing, and coordinator of the Public Relations Department for ADimpressions.  "There's always a catch-22 for recently graduated students.  After receiving a degree, they still cannot get hired in many places because they're required to have had experience."  GMMI effectively provides the experience and education necessary for the students to find employment, Traub said.

Professor Dugan said that although some of the students realized that there was more work than they originally thought, he believes they will leave with a great collegiate experience before they enter the professional world. 

"I think this [course] is as real as it gets," Dugan said.  "I think the students have encountered all sorts of work ethic problems - many deal with group dynamics." 

"Spring Break 2 - The Extreme Getaway" will be held on April 10 from 10:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.

Headline: Delta Lamba Phi petitions for fraternity status
Author: Adriana Oliva / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
First introduced to FIU as Gamma Lambda Mu, and now known as Delta Lambda Phi, the members of this gay organization are petitioning for fraternity status from the FIU InterFraternity Council for the fall semester of 2003.

According to co-founder Jorge Casas, FIU has 10 fraternities presently affiliated with the IFC; DLP would need six votes out of 10 to gain membership. 

During the fall semester of 2002, co-founder Mario Campa and Casas began researching other already established gay fraternities. They also started communication bridges with them, as well as with national gay fraternities such as Delta Lambda Phi and Alpha Lambda Tau. The plan was eventually to get picked up by one of these national organizations and become a local branch.   

"We were considered an interest group for both Delta Lambda Phi and Alpha Lambda Tau," Casas said.

Evolving quickly, the 14 members unanimously voted to colonize with Delta Lambda Phi in mid-November, the ease of which delighted DLP members.

"I am glad that we are moving along and evolving so quickly and so well," senior Alvaro Gutierrez said. "I truly feel that it's because we all strive to accomplish our goals although we have diverse backgrounds."

Becoming a colony is the second step in advancing to a full-fledged branch of the national fraternity.

"By the end of fall 2002, we had prepared a colony petition that we sent to DLP's national headquarters asking them to grant us colony status," Casas said. 

A colony petition is a long essay that is submitted to the national organization and includes members and reasons for wanting to join.

On March 9, 2003, Gamma Lambda Mu established themselves as a colony of DLP, changing their organization's name to that of their national counterpart. 

The next step and goal for DLP is to become a chapter. In order for this to occur, the organization needs to induct three pledge classes.

"When DLP was born on March 9, we initiated our very first Alpha class that consisted of 14 members," Campa said.

The Alpha class will be inducted on April 27 to New Member status. 

"Our Beta class, or second class, will be inducted as pledges when the alpha class gets bumped up to new member status," Campa said.

Both Campa and Casas acknowledge the pledge period as a time of learning and educating.

The pledge period is a time frame during which it is required to learn the basics about fraternities and the actual history of Delta Lambda Phi, as well as its symbols, Campa said.

"We also get to decide on what new traditions we want to build and which old ones to keep," said Casas. "It's really nice because we are the first class, so we get to set the standards and we get to do it together, which is essentially the best part."	

From the time Delta Lambda Phi first started as Gamma Lambda Mu and launched itself, it has received national media coverage.

DLP got national attention when its saga was picked up by The Miami Herald, Time magazine, In the News (Tampa) and Connections, which is a publication based in California.

Despite the coverage, DLP has not yet had an increase in the numbers of men trying to join.

"There hasn't really been a stream of new students, but wait till the fall semester starts," Casas said.

There is a bright side to this exposure though. The organization has received random calls and emails from people wanting to support.

"We have gotten tons of calls from people who have read the articles and want to donate money to us," Casas said.

They were also asked to co-sponsor the Miami Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. 

Now that the group has established a foundation, its members are just looking to grow and prosper. 

"I would like to see us grow stronger and have the stereotypes of the gay community erased," sophomore Juan Sebastian Arguello said.

Members are excited about their cause and say it gives them a chance to show FIU's diversity and gives them  a support group for what they believe in. 

"There are things in your life that you just can't tell your parents and even your best friends," Gutierrez said. "But a brother is different because no matter what the situation may be, I know that there will always be support and most importantly, trust."

Headline: Shepard encourages students to accept diversity
Author: Angela Castillo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Campus Life Lecture Committee welcomed guest speaker Judy Shepard March 31  at the GC Ballroom. She conducted a lecture on "Hate Crimes" that kicked off FIU's first  Motivation Week. 

Four years ago, Judy Shepard lost her son Matthew in a gay-hate crime. Since then, she has transformed her family's tragedy into a crusade for justice in an effort to raise awareness about discrimination and the importance of diversity. 

 "I'm not a professional speaker, I'm a mom," Judy Shepard said as she took the podium. "I'm here to show a different perspective, not to change your mind."

Judy Shepard started the lecture by discussing what she described as her "worst nightmare." 

Her 21-year-old son, Matthew, a gay college student, was fatally beaten and lashed to a fence by two men. In December 1998, the same year of Matthew's death, the Shepard family founded the "Matthew Shepard Foundation" as a way to honor their late son.  The foundation is a national non-profit organization that strives to "educate and replace hate with understanding, acceptance and compassion." Shepard, executive director of the foundation, said that the reason she travels around and speaks out, carrying the "legacy of Matthew Shepard" is not only because she does not want to see another Matt die, but also to encourage people to embrace and promote diversity. 

"[Judy] has let us realize that we have to move forward and make a difference in our world," FIU Stonewall Pride Alliance Vice-President Chelsea Boehme,  who attended the lecture, said.  "We and our children need to embrace diversity in order for hate crimes to not take place; gays and lesbians should be socially accepted."

Shepard told students that hate is a learned behavior that threatens all minorities and that such behavior must be unlearned.

 The best and simplest way to start, she said, is refusing to listen to jokes about "fags" because it is through these that people get permission for actual harassment. 

Shepard also addressed the issues of gay adoption and marriage as a way to support the legislation regarding equality of rights for homosexuals. In addition, she encouraged parents and friends of the gay and lesbian community to join Parents and Family of Lesbians and Gays, a national organization promoting the health and well-being of gay, lesbian and bisexual persons.

Before Shepard answered the audience's questions, she gave a piece of advice to the FIU community: "We are all human beings [who] should care for one another." As soon as she finished lecturing, an audience member asked her, "What advice do you give for those who are trying to survive against family rejection?" Judy and the audience member hugged and burst into tears.  

 Judy Shepard addressed the parents in the audience. "If you reject your kids because of their sexual option, you are not taking the time to learn from that choice." 

Students were not only touched by Matthew's story, but also by the courage Shepard had when speaking about her son's death.

 "I was touched by Judy's ability to lecture on something so sensitive for her, and I think that every person in [the GC ballroom] walked out of  there thanking [Judy] for the opportunity to hear her perspective that is based on the compassion we may have for people like Matthew," sophomore Andrea Lamelas said. 

Motivation Week will hopefully become an FIU tradition, said Clayton Solomon, University Park Student Government Council president-elect. "I think racial, cultural, and personal diversity is what makes FIU unique.  Events such as these are constantly helping me to grow as an individual and understand my peers."

Headline: Parillon succeeds Carter
Author: Geannina Munizaga/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council election results were announced in Panther Square shortly after noon April 3.

Voter turnout for the election reached an all-time high, beating last year's record by 1,000 votes according to David Cole, associate director of Campus Life and Orientation at BBC. 

"This election has been the most successful election in FIU history," Cole said before announcing the winners. "There were 4,656 total votes and 769 of the were cast at BBC. That's our best in two years."

Nicaise Parillon won the BBC-SGC presidency with 368 votes, beating her closest opponent by more than 100 votes.

"I want to have a good relationship with my vice president, the administration, students and SGC and make sure what needs to be done gets done," Parillon said.

Administration is pleased with the experience Parillon brings to the table.

"She is the oldest member in the council to be elected into office," Cole said. "She has been there through the good and the bad with the council and this experience will help her immensely."

Filling the shoes of her predecessor Adrian Carter, who is also Parillon's husband, is a concern for Cole.

"Nicaise's challenge is going to be carving out her own legacy," Cole said.

Carter disagrees with that statement.

"Nicaise winning is FIU winning," Carter said. "I have no problem assisting [her] strategize her approach to issue[s]...however, she will pursue her own agenda and run the council how she sees [fit]."

During his term, Carter believes he has made a difference at BBC.

"My role in student government has been to build the intangibles: bring integrity to SGC, build a sustainable relationship with the administration, make BBC issues more of a priority to the administration, and create a workable and consistent structure for SGC to work under," Carter said. "This I have done. [Though] issues never go away, BBC is better today than it was two years ago."

Parillon plans to begin instilling her "Five Star Plan," which includes improving customer service, creating a student media outlet and improving computer labs. 

Of the five, Parillon plans to tackle more pressing issues first, such as increasing class offerings and improving international student health insurance.

"To me, all aspects hold their own weight," Parillon said. "My plan doesn't single out any [type of] student in particular. It benefits the entire population, even alumni."

Ruth-Allyson Webster, who won the BBC-SGC vice presidency, ran for the position most voted for. She acquired 54.3 percent of votes.

"I put my all into [campaigning]. I had my name and face all over campus," Webster said. "I'm really enthusiastic about [the results]. [SGC] has a lot in store and I want to make a difference."

Webster's immediate concern is to create a student hold plan in which students are still able to register and allowed more time to pay fees, even if they have financial holds. 

"Students want to be in and out of here [quickly]. I want to help them accomplish that," Webster said.

Sophomore Merdochey Lafrance beat opponent Kattia Latino by 34 votes for the position of BBC-SGC representative at-large.

"I never dreamed I would be running, let alone win," LaFrance said. "I look forward to being the students' voice. I'm here for them."

Micah Mintz, sophomore, political science, won 64 percent of the votes, defeating two other opponents for lower division representative. 

"I'm ready to do anything that is necessary for students and SGC," Mintz said.

Votes were also cast for candidates who ran unopposed, which include Jesille Peters, voted Hospitality Management representative, and Raul Quintero, now the representative for the College of Health and Urban Sciences.

Students at BBC are satisfied with the election results, although some have doubts about campaign promises.

"Results were as expected," said Amoy Perrier, junior, nursing. "If Nicaise can manage finances, then she can run the school. I just hope all the candidates practice what they preach."

Others are bothered by the candidates' behavior.

"I think a lot of politics were involved in this election...it was crazy," Nikita Turk, sophomore, advertising, said. "I was surprised, I thought [the election] would yield different results."

Of the seven candidates who did not win, some plan to remain involved in student government. 

"I'm happy to have been a part of some record breaking turnout," Alex Lewy, former BBC-SGC vice-president, said. "And I will still be part of the system. There are two open spots representative-wise and one chair position I will be looking into."

Clayton "Hank" Schramm, who ran for vice-president, will move to Texas with his family to attend school in Dallas.

"I wanted to stay in FIU, but this gives me another opportunity in my life," Schramm said. "I am fairly certain I will get into the schools I'm scouting."

Admatha Israel, another vice presidential candidate, is looking into a job with the City of Miami and plans to run again next year.

"This election was training for the next one," Israel said. "I've learned a lot about the political system. It was a valuable experience for me."

"We are the champions! We are the champions!"

The victory song blared from the speakers in the Graham Center forum April 3 when the winners for the new president and vice president of University Park Student Government Council - Clayton Solomon, current SGC representative at large, and Ron Hollis, SPC president -  were named.

GC filled with cheers, surprised faces and a roar from the crowd as soon as the students heard the name, "Clayton..." The immediate screams of fellow students muffled the rest of the announcement.

"I'm really excited and overwhelmed right now.  I don't feel like myself," Hollis said after the announcement.

Solomon and Hollis defeated their opponents, Jorge Rosario and Ana Manrara, by 319 votes.  Rosario and Manrara got 45.87 percent of the votes.  The candidates and students said the numbers were the biggest shock.

"I went to bed [the night before elections] knowing that I lost," Solomon said. "Five minutes before the election, I went to [current UP-SGC president] Jessica Morffi's office wondering what to do when I lose.  When they announced my name, I didn't know what to do.  It's amazing."

Once the winners were announced, balloons rained from the ceiling, students threw confetti  and "we won" was the chant of the moment.  Grown men and women cried as campaigners lifted the new president and vice president in the air.

"I'm pretty ecstatic," said freshman Chris Ramcharran, who campaigned for Solomon and Hollis. "I put a lot of hard work, sweat and time into this campaign and I believe it paid off."	

According to out-going Vice President Omar Castillo, this year's campaign was cleaner than that of previous years. Students could not go wrong with either ticket, Castillo added.

"One thing that Clayton and I had, which a lot of people didn't have in the past, was an open line of communication, which kept the campaign very clean," Rosario said. "I know he will do a great job." 

Rosario and Manrara remain positive about the outcome of the election.

"I think that the most important thing after something so big like this is to be able to look back and say 'no regrets,'" Manrara said. "I would like to remain involved in student government and it would be my great pleasure to serve on Clayton and Ron's council this upcoming year."

Morffi suggested that Solomon and Hollis "stay focused on their goals,  work hard and do not lose any time because the year goes faster than one would believe." 

Other winners were also announced. Of the four students who ran for the three positions as representative at-large, Malik Wilkes won 1344 votes, Nancy Cadavid got 1126 votes, and Leo DaSilva received 1089 votes.

"I feel great about my victory," Wilkes said. "I worked hard over the last two weeks and I felt I was prepared."

Djenny Derane and Jackie Ginarte, won the two positions for lower division representative.

The only two candidates for the two positions of graduate representative, Aravinthan Arunachalam and Salman Azhar, tied at 105 votes.

The following candidates ran unopposed: College of Arts and Sciences Representative Roxane Fuentes, Architecture Representative Jennifer Frasen, Engineering Representative Marianne Espinoza, Law School Representative Collette Papa, Health and Urban Affairs Representative Max Gauthier, Honors College Representative Santiago Bermudez, and Housing Representative Phillip Hamilton.

Headline: Venezuelan Punk Group rocks the U.S.
Author: Jack Hernandez, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There was a massive amount of people waiting for the doors to open at Congas night club in Fort Lauderdale this past Friday. The entire crowd was very excited that Caramelos de Cianuro, which means Poison Candy, was playing live for the fourth time here in South Florida. 

Known for their incredible mixture of punk with alternative rock, Caramelos came from Venezuela as part of their promotional tour.

The Venezuelan-native group was celebrating their 12th anniversary together.  Caramelos  consists of Asier Cazalis, lead vocals, Miguel Gonzalez (a.k.a. "El Enano"), guitar, Alfonso Tosta on the drums and Luis Barrios playing the bass.

Signed to the international label, PolyGram in 1996, this band is revolutionizing a punk rock movement in Latin America.

 Still, this band has toured all over North and South America and their fan base is quickly increasing.

It was a couple of minutes past midnight and Caramelos was already rocking the Ft. Lauderdale crowd. The audience of about 600 people was singing and moshing to Caramelos' hit singles, "El Martillo", "Las Estrellas", and "Veronica".

I was fortunate enough to interview the band, here is what they had to say: 

Q: Can you name a couple of American bands which have influence on your career and music? 

Barrios:"Well we are currently listening to Audioslave, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Good Charlotte". 

Q: Did you guys expect such an enormous crowd tonight? 

Cazalis: "We kind of had a feeling that a large crowd was going to show up, but one thing we are all sure of is they are all going to have an incredible experience are most likely to mosh all night long"

Q:What's your opinion of Spanish alternative music here in the U.S. these days? 

Tosta:"It's definitely getting the support it needs all over from promoters, the press, radio stations, and most important the fans. Bands like Juanes are making sure it gets even bigger."

Their new and 4th album, Frisbee has an evolutionary sound and is packed with an incredible amount of energy. Caramelos de Cianuro will continue their promotional tour and are going to be playing a series of gigs here in the U.S.

Headline: Sigur Rós progresses with unique sound
Author: John Lovell, Arts Editor
&nbsp;
I love those few moments in life when everything about existence feels so perfect; when it just makes complete sense to believe that the world really can be beautiful. The Sigur Rós concert I witnessed at the House of Blues in New Orleans in late March was full of those moments. In fact, I would say the entire show, from the opening band to the end of the encore, was a huge reminder of how great it is to be alive. 

The band was nearing the end of their U.S. tour, a follow up to their 2002 release titled, (). Yes, those are parenthesis and no, the vocals on () do not contain any actual lyrics. Vocalist Jón Thór Birgisson, instead, sings in "Hopelandic," a practice only briefly experimented with on their previous albums which were sung mostly in Icelandic.

Basically, Hopelandic is an invented language that doesn't translate to anything at all. It's a sophisticated kind of melodic gibberish that simply acts as an additional instrument. The result is incredibly addictive and as strange as it sounds, it is one of the coolest things you will ever hear. Sigur Rós' musical originality does not end there; when Birgisson isn't strumming the guitar with a violin bow, he raises it to his mouth and sings into it as a medium for vocal effects. 

In the song, Hafssól, bass guitarist Georg Hólm plays the bass with a drumstick, it's things like these one can only experience at a live performance.

If you have heard Sigur Rós, you probably have an idea of what I'm talking about, otherwise it might be a little difficult to understand the wonderful degree of intensity I'm almost positive the entire crowd felt that night. 

I must honestly say I felt like I wanted to die when the show ended and the house lights came on, not because it was over but because I didn't think anything else in my life would ever feel so great. 

The show was something else. After a very pleasant opener, musician Jimmy Lavell's euphoric electronic band The Album Leaf, Sigur Rós aimlessly entered accompanied by the all-female string quartet, Amina-an essential component of the concert's flawlessness. 

By only the end of the second song, Birgisson massacred his bow, strumming it against the guitar with a frightening ferocity and even slamming it against the strings. The audience and I could do nothing but let our jaws drop.  This was a constant throughout the show, eyes and ears always to the stage where Sigur Rós boldly fed us every emotion imaginable.

Birgisson's voice resonated and shook the room, summoning up all the little hair follicles on my arms and neck. He mastered vocal range and volume level, singing very soft at times and viscously ferocious at others. 

The strings in the background kept a perfect balance with the melodies, blending in and standing out when necessary. Guitarist Kjartan Sveinsson, who also provided the flute and piano, maintained an effortless sync with the complex rhythms, while drummer Orri Páll Dyrason belted out some of the most incredible beats I had ever heard. He literally beat the hell out of his drum kit as if he had some sort of vendetta to resolve; it was fantastic.

After an anxious encore with several of their well-known songs, such as Starálfur, Sigur Rós exited one by one only to return twice for very theatrical and appreciative bows. 

They returned the audience's applause and Birgisson even handed his demangled bow to a lucky individual in the crowd.

 It is very exciting to know that creative new things are being done with and to music. Bands like Sigur Rós are living proof that a little bit of imagination and creativity can go a really long way. 

They are unafraid, taking serious risks with their music and in doing so create something that is, without a doubt, sheer genius.

&nbsp;
The White Stripes

Elephant 4 stars

The White Stripes' chic new album, Elephant, skillfully presents music in its purest and simplest form. The album was written, recorded, mixed and mastered without the use of computers; a brave move that clearly paid off for the band. 

Without innovative studio effects to cover it up, Elephant is an album standing naked in front of its audience. The album goes into different atmospheres, each with their own pleasing qualities. 

It begins with "Seven Nation Army," a masterpiece in itself. Not only pleasing to the ear, this tune features a guitar riff so melodious it sticks to your brain and sucks you in. The drums add to the melody, allowing you to bob your head to the beat of this truly sensational song.   

 The rest of the album is moody, with some soft, low tempo tracks like the smooth "You've Got Her In Your Pocket" that lead to crazier tracks like the classic "There's No Home For You Here," which embodies The White Stripes' signature garage sound. 

Elephant is remarkable for its ability to speak to listeners through its instruments. The guitars in these songs take on a life of their own and  convey as much emotion as Jack and Meg's vocals do. 

This album brings more to the table than most of its kind, giving listeners a raw musical experience. It is a "must listen to" for anyone who loves music.

-Robert J. Gramatges



Amon Tobin

Out From Out Where 3.5 out of 4 stars

What's so scary about Amon Tobin? Personally, I picture him hiding away on some distant planet, hunched over a set of turntables and a laptop while he tinkers out a soundtrack fit for navigating uncharted territories: landscapes both beautiful and terrifyingly intimidating. 

 Out From Out Where is a beacon of light from the outer folds of the aural universe, a gentle flicker in the corner of your eye, and a blazing supernova that outgrows itself with each progressive meditation.  The songs in this album seem to seep out of the speakers and swell up the room, curling around and straight through the listener. Tobin has created music that almost feels alive on its own, and that can even be creepy at times

With a determination to reinvent the music, Out From boasts grand orchestrations of vast sounds, deep growls and hollow, metal clanks that collide with acrobatic beats and dark, drooping bass lines. "Back From Space," the opening song, majestically shines like a bio-luminescent specimen of the deep. "Chronic Tronic" features a more complete picture of Tobin's sound. The song stretches out mechanical tentacles, unfurling ragged chunks of beat while whiney strings scissor through melancholy sitar riffs.  

"Proper Hoodige" slowly cranks along, heaving like a large and overexerted animal. The song maintains a liveliness with intricate layers of taps, pops, cranks and the signature thickness in all of Tobin's songs that sounds like something in between the crackling of an old vinyl recording and a storm as heard from inside a house. Out From contains pieces that simply glow.  The intricate movements create a very stylized sound that slowly grow and unfold with every attentive listen.

-Monica Gonzalez



Celine Dion

One Heart 2.5 out of 4 stars

 Just by looking at the track listing of Celine Dion's new album,  One Heart, you can tell this album was obviously rushed so it could be released in conjunction with her new Las Vegas show, which opened on the same day. The biggest proof of the rush is that three of the tracks on the album, "Have You Ever Been in Love," "Sorry For Love" and "Coulda Woulda Shoulda," which previously appeared on Dion's 2002 album A New Day Has Come.  

The bright spots on One Heart include the opening track and first single, the Cindy Lauper cover "I Drove All Night." Though maybe not at first, it will eventually get stuck in your head and leave you wanting more.

One of the weakest songs on the album is producer/writer Max Martin's "Love is All We Need." 

"I Know What Love Is" is one of the strongest ballads on the album. The album closes with "Je T'aime Encore," which begins on a down note, but builds up to the end, gratefully giving the CD a good finish.

Dion's amazing voice is what carries this album.  People who are die-hard fans will enjoy this album, but those who are fans of her biggest hits and like to focus on quality, will be yearning for the days of My heart will go on.

Headline: BBC Spring Fling concert a resounding success
Author: Michael Barnett, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU students and Reggae fans alike were treated to an entertaining Caribbean musical package last week, courtesy of BBC's Student Programming Council. Their annual Spring Fling Concert this year was outside on the lawn, between the Hospitality building and the Bay. Having the concert outside proved to be a great idea as the sizable crowd that attended were able to enjoy both the bayside breeze and the show, without having to worry about being hot, sweaty and dehydrated. The concert notably proceeded without incident or tension, probably because of the serene outdoor setting. 

The outdoor stage that had been built out on the lawn was impressive with its full array of lighting spread across the top of the front metal frame, complete with strobe lights on the sides, as well as the huge SPC banner which provided the back drop for the stage area.

Security for the concert was visibly tight with several Public Safety officers stationed at all corners of the concert perimeter, and the screening of all concert attendees with a metal detector gate placed at the entrance to the grounds which had been thoroughly encircled with wire fencing. The concert was heavily staffed by SPC students and other student volunteers, effectively facilitating the manning of the front gate, the entrances of the Hospitality building , (which served as a VIP lounge for artists), and the entrances to the Wolfe Student Center which served as the key reception area for Elephant Man. It was clear to see that a lot of planning had gone into the programming of this event right down to the very last detail.  

The early arriving patrons to the show were treated to the reggae selections of Earth Quake Sound, a popular local reggae sound system. After the scintillating reggae selections of Earth Quake came the first act, Nia -George, the new Trini sensation. Having a decidedly Soca music oriented repertoire, Nia was well received by the Trinidadian members of the crowd. After almost half an hour of live Soca, the crowd was treated to that notorious 99Jams Duo, Papa Keith and DJ Khaled. The energy level of the crowd was noticeably raised when DJ Khaled came on the decks with his assortment of Hip Hop hits, with heads bobbing up and down and hands pointing up to the sky. Khaled seemingly had the entire crowd so enthralled and pumped up that many were clamoring for more when he left the stage after about 15 minutes of mixing. Amidst much adulation and cheers, Khaled came back on stage and obliged the crowd with ten more minutes or so of intense Hip Hop. 

When Papa Keith returned to stage the crowd by now was absolutely ecstatic and were most receptive to the new and upcoming Dancehall artist Kip Rich who came on stage as the official warm up act for the star performer Elephant Man. Kip Rich a fairly seasoned artist at Jamaica's major Dancehall concert 'Sting', put on a masterful show. He performed songs like "Leggo de Bwoy" and "Dead Now". Kip Rich, a good friend of Elephant Man, has been touring with him now for at least two years. 

Then came the moment that the crowd had been waiting for- the arrival of the Elephant Man, currently one of Jamaica's most popular DJ's, especially in terms of live performances. For the record this writer can say that on this show, Elephant Man did not disappoint. Nicknamed the 'Energy God' because of his wild stage  antics, Elephant more than lived up to his name, jumping up on top of the stacked speakers on both sides of the front of the stage several times, and bouncing up and down to the contagious dancehall rhythms of the live band, Paradise. In addition, he invited several girls up on stage and indulged them with some highly erotic pelvis and hip gesticulations. 

Elephant Man began his set with tracks like "Jamaica" and "Move up your Bumper" and his self-titled song- "Elephant Man." Elephant Man then performed "Hot Girls," "Jamaica Pt. II" off his Log On album. He then moved onto "Show Me Dem," "Tall up Tall up" and his big hit "Online."

The performance of "Online" was probably the highlight of Elephant Man's show as almost every body in the crowd seemed to be following the artist's lead, turning themselves from side to side and pushing the lead foot forward, as Elephant Man demonstrated ecstatically how his self pioneered dance should be done. 

After the show, Elephant Man said that he enjoyed the evening and wished that he could have performed longer. The show had to end at 2:00 a.m. sharp because of University regulations, at which time Elephant Man was about 45 minutes or so into an electrifying set. The choice of artist by SPC president Brock Louider was admittedly a master stroke, especially since Elephant is arguably the most entertaining of all the current Jamaican Dance Hall Artists. 

The SPC advisor Rafael Zapata as well as North Campus Life Director David Cole were on hand at the event to make sure that everything went smoothly in terms of production and logistics. And smoothly it did go, giving the patrons a reggae Dancehall show that was comparable than the recent Dancehall Reggae show at UM this past weekend. 

SPC sources indicated that the total cost of  staging the concert was about $30, 000 and that all outstanding overheads were successfully covered by the total sale of tickets.

Headline: Powerful Neshat images question society
Author: Nery Diaz, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Shirin Neshat, an Iranian-born artist, creates visual poems where the narrative is replaced by stunning scenery, haunting music and breathtaking cinematography. 

Six video installations and twelve related photographs of Shirin Neshat's work are now exhibited at the Miami Art Museum through June 1, 2003.   

Her work is composed of video and sound environments with related photographs. In these visually breathtaking poems, every frame is a perfectly developed photograph based on the universal themes of hope, fear and longing.

Neshat's first works explored the role of women in a modern Islamic Society. "From the beginning I made a decision that this work was not going to be about me or my opinions on the subject, and that my position was going to be no position. I then put myself in a place of only asking questions but never answering them" said Neshat.

Neshat came to the United States in 1974 to study art at the University of California, Berkeley. It was not until several visits to her native country, Iran in the 1990s when Neshat realized, "I had reached a sort of intellectual maturity that I did not have before," she said. It was then that Neshat began to make photographs and videos.  

"Turbulent" is a ten-minute black and white film inspired by the Iran prohibition on women participating in the performance or recording of music.  

This piece is expressed on two juxtaposing movie screens. On one screen, a man before an all male audience passionately sings a song inspired by the Sufi poet, Jalal al-Din Rumi.  

On the other screen, a woman is standing on the stage of an empty concert hall. When the male singer finishes, the camera slowly begins to swirl around the solitary figure of the woman on the stage. The woman begins to utter a series of nonsensical sounds. As the camera increases its hypnotic trance around the woman, the utterances become louder and more piercing. The camera action becomes more energetic and creates a sense of urgency that is suddenly curtailed by the silence of the woman's voice.  

Filmed in 1999, "Soliloquy," explores the identity issues that arise from living in exile. In this film, Neshat is shown veiled against two contrasting cityscapes. On different screens, eastern and western architecture provides the backdrop for the contrasting cultures.  

Neshat wanders through opposing worlds exploring the sense of displacement that is the reality of a life led in exile.  

Neshat's work is internationally acclaimed because it deals with the difficult questions confronting modern societies in an honest manner, that is neither brutal nor ugly. This quality makes Neshat one of the premier artists of our generation. 

Neshat is the winner of several national and international awards, including the First International Prize at the 48th Venice Biennale. 

Admission to the Miami Art Museum is free on Sundays and the second Saturday of the month. Otherwise admission is $2.50 with a student ID.

Marisol, a Bronx native of Puerto Rican heritage, has an unsavory narrow escape on the subway from a man with a golf club - with a little help from her guardian angel. That night she has a dream-like visitationwhere she is told that her angel is leaving her, along with all angels, to fight a cataclysmic war with a senile God, who has stopped paying attention to the human race.

Was it a dream, or was it real? What did the angel mean when she said, "When I drop my wings of peace, you won't recognize the world"?

Headline: car theft
Subheadline:  
Author: dtyanks1@aol.com
&nbsp;
this letter is regarding the real crimes being committed at this university. i read the beacon all the time every tuesday i grab a copy and i find in some of the issues your crime reports. most of them consist of incidents that end in a happy ending or petty things that do not really affect anyone such as a vending machine that was vandalized and yet nothing was taken out of it. i want to talk about what happens when a car is broken into, or stolen. does anyone know what happens? because i have had two cars broken into within the past 9 months at this university (university park campus).one was stolen and found 3 days later completely stripped and the other one they were not so lucky to take. what i do not seem to understand is why nobody is investigating these crimes? i know i am not the only one who has had a car stolen here which makes me think what exactly is it that we are paying for when we pay all the fees we are made to pay? we pay a parking fee, is that only to provide us with a slab of concrete in which to put my car on? is that what we all pay for? i understand that the new trend now is to not worry about auto thefts because everyone feels that the insurances will pay for it. well that is great if all they were taking were cars, but instead what these people are taking are our valuables, things that may have been our graduation presents, our birthday presents, things that have a sentimental value to us not just a big piece of machinery that takes us from point a to point b. not to mention all the money we all put into these cars, and  i do not mean the money we put into making them more desirable to the eye, instead i mean the money you pay every month, so that they do no take it from us, i mean the money we pay our insurances in case something happens to our cars. my question is again why is it that nobody cares to investigate why it is that there are cars being taken from the parking lots we pay to park in, while im paying attention to my professor who is going over what is going to be on my final next week. why do i have to have extra worries because nobody sees that a car is being stolen in the middle of the day twice!?! can somebody explain these things to me? because i am not understanding.
