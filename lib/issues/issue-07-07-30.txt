Headline: Librarians enjoy 'academic detective work'
Author: Jose Parlade / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Although Jorge Pearson and Stephanie Brenenson both work in different FIU campuses, they both feel their roles as librarians are crucial to enhancing student knowledge and diverse points of view.

"Libraries are fierce advocates of intellectual freedom," said Pearson, a librarian at the Biscayne Bay Campus. "We supply all different sorts of ideas, perspectives, and resources. We're the middleman who doesn't charge."

"I enjoy exploring new and better ways to teach and supply information to students. Everything [librarians] do is make students have a great experience," said Brenenson, a Library Instruction Coordinator at University Park's Green Library.

Pearson has worked at the BBC Library since 1990. He said he has seen it change from having print-based resources to currently having a large number of available computers with Internet access.

"I've enjoyed seeing the changes," Pearson said. "For the library to stay a central part of FIU, it has to meet the changing needs of students, faculty, and staff."

Some of Pearson's goals are to keep up with what is happening worldwide and to help make the BBC Library more accessible to students.

"I have to know what they are talking about and what information sources would best fit their needs. In a sense, it's a bit like selling TVs. You have to know the product, and you have to know what the customer wants and needs," Pearson said. 

Supplying people with needed resources has always professionally interested Pearson, who graduated from Montclair Saint University in New Jersey and later worked at what is now called Macy's at the Westland Mall in Hialeah selling television sets. 

 "Working as a salesman helped [me] develop [my] psychological and communication skills. In retail, it's called qualifying the customer: what motivates them, what does their body language say, what do they really want? You go through a similar process when you help people at the reference desk," Pearson said. 

After observing the duties of his sister, who is a librarian and witnessing her satisfaction with her career, Pearson decided to become a librarian and took courses in Library Education at the International Fine Arts College in Downtown Miami.

Pearson said that he has enjoyed his basic duties as a librarian because he enjoys primarily being available to help people if they need it.

"I know what it's like to be in a frustrating situation where you don't know what to do or how to proceed. As a librarian, I get to be that person [who helps others]. I'm the one who helps track down a long lost relative, or locate an article that a student has to have [so that he will not] bomb out in a course," he said. 

Pearson predicts that the BBC Library will undergo changes in the future as it advances technologically.

"The electronic revolution of the 1990's isn't over. It's just entering a new phase," Pearson said. "The Internet is rapidly becoming a social space where people communicate and access information in radically different ways than surfing the web."

Pearson said he looks forward to making the BBC Library one that will facilitate technological resources in order to create an even better student environment.

"Librarians are well placed to keep up with all this, because we understand the organization of information, and have insight into how people access and use it. But it's a huge challenge, because the changes that are happening are so extreme and happen so fast," Pearson said.   

Likewise, Brenenson said that she looks forward to trying to provide great experiences through new and better methods of teaching for students who use the UP library, such as podcasting and teaching through gaming, which she believes may become intertwined with her functions as Library Instruction Coordinator in the future. 

The emergence of better technology that allows students to learn faster and easier has played a role in her methods of teaching.

"We also try to use technology as much as we can," Brenenson said. "New technology helps students utilize new resources and databases." 

Brenenson moved to Miami from New York in 1996 in order to work at the Green   Library. An enticing aspect of this position for her was the ability to provide information.

"The curiosity and the search for information - they are both very exciting to me," Brenenson said. "It's like academic detective work."

Brenenson is currently preparing for her elected role as chairperson of the Library Faculty Assembly, which she starts in September. She said this position will allow her to facilitate and encourage decisions within the UP and the BBC Libraries.

"We are here to support locating and creating information. We are here to make everybody happy."

Headline: Drama club lets students explore their artistic sides
Author: Vanessa A. Alvarez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Stephen Neal, FIU theater professor, sought to give the Biscayne Bay Campus students the opportunity to hone their social skills through the performing arts with the BBC Dramatics club.

The reason Neal was driven to help form the club was not only because there were no acting or theater classes being offered at BBC, but also because he remembers how acting changed his life for the better.

"I was able to overcome my shyness and by the time I graduated, I was one of the most popular and respected kids in the class. I attribute this and much of my success in life, to the caring teacher who reached out to me and to the self-confidence she helped me find through acting exercises and training," he said. Neal was soon determined to pass on the gift his teacher had given him by agreeing to be the driving force for the club as its advisor.

"It has been very good for the kids [at BBC] to exercise their passions for theater.  [The club] has helped people outside of the major be comfortable with the idea of being in front of an audience," he said. 

The club, which  began in 2002 with the goal to get more theater-related events at BBC, rapidly evolved into an organization specifically for non-theater major students who have an interest in exploring their artistic side. 

Dramatics members get their chance to participate in large-scale productions and activities such as Open-Mic Night, which occurs once every semester and gives members the chance to sing, act and recite poetry. They also participate in Skit Day, which is when they collectively pick a skit and perform it for anyone willing to watch.  

Plays such as: "Butterflies are Free," "Beyond Therapy,"  "The Odd Couple," and "Baby with the Bath Water," a comedy by Christopher Durang, have all been performed at BBC since the creation of the club.  

The club is funded by the Student Organizations Council and according to John Morris, Dramatics president, the actors participate in fund-raisers and even use their own props in the productions. 

"For the last show we had, my parents came and recognized half the set," he said, "They kept on telling themselves 'Ooh, I recognize that table cloth, I recognize that chair,'" Morris continued.

Morris, a senior double-majoring in English and History, was one of the charter members of Dramatics.

He and a few other students decided to create the club in the Spring of 2002 after taking Introduction to Acting with Neal. Morris says that without Neal, the club wouldn't have been as successful.  

"Professor Neal is one of our biggest supporters. This club is his baby. He's our advisor, our mentor. If we ever need anything, he's always there," Morris said.  

According to Morris, to join Dramatics no experience is required. The only requirement is creativity. 

"Acting does not have to be the only interest. Some people come up to us and say 'I want to join but I can't act and that is okay because there's a job for anyone who wants to get involved. People can participate in the areas of production, make-up, and even stage," Morris said. 

Now, going on its fifth year, the club, which Neal dreamt would serve as a creative outlet for students, has also opened many doors outside of school for its members.  

Students like Heather Callam, former president of the club and FIU alumna, for instance, had the opportunity to participate in a short film while staying focused on her non-theatrical major. The mini-film titled "Spies," which she helped write, direct, produce, as well as act in, debuted at the first FIU Film Festival last Spring. 

However, according to Callam, this was not the only thing she got from her active participation in Dramatics.

"Dramatics allowed me to open up to people. It helped me come out of my shell and be around other cultures.

I began participating in activities around school and eventually this lead me to become more involved in my community. And while I am passionate about acting, I'm looking forward to either going on to law school or obtaining a masters degree in social work," Callam said.   

The club, which began with a group of 20, now operates with a mere handful of active members. A conflict of schedules is the reason for the inactivity, but that does not stop Dramatics and in fact, according to Morris, there is still a lot of interest to keep the club going.  

Three Dramatics members have been cast to perform in the community theater show "Jack and Jill and the Special Wish" this summer. The show will tour in South Florida and will open to the public Aug. 17. The location has not been confirmed. 

Furthermore, the club is considering to bring the musical performance of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" to the Mary Ann Wolfe Theater within the next year.

Headline: SGA discusses Aquatic Center, food options
Author: Elvis Ramirez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Student Government Council representatives discussed several issues that will affect students in the upcoming semesters at the University-wide meeting. The new cafeteria and Aquatic Center renovations were some of the items discussed at the meeting held at the Biscayne Bay Campus on July 31.

Ten people consisting of Student Government Association members and a few guests attended the University-wide meeting, which was held in the Campus Life office room at the Wolfe University Center.

The status of the new cafeteria at BBC was one of the first topics discussed. The cafeteria will not be opening in the Fall semester due to construction being six months behind schedule, according to Cassandra Andrade, SGC-BBC vice president.

Gabriel Labrador, former speaker of the house for the university-wide meetings, said there may be a conflict between FIU and Aramark, the company that provides the University with its food services. Labrador did not give any details as to what the conflict could be since the University has not given any official word on the subject.

Andrade said that the cafeteria will be divided into three components. Bleaker Street Cafe will serve fresh fruits, soups and other healthy options, and Grille Works, will continue to serve hamburgers and other grilled menu items. The third component will most likely be Moe's Southwest Grill, but this is still in the works, Andrade said.

Aside from the cafeteria, another food option for BBC students is in the works. The snacks and drinks section of the bookstore will remain open past the store's normal hours. Discussions about the convenience store's expanded inventory and the date of its opening are still under way, Andrade said.

According to Andrade, a quality assurance program for the food offered at both campuses has also been proposed by Damian Fernandez, the University's vice provost.

The SGC representatives also spoke about the funding for repairs for the Aquatic Center at BBC. 

"The price hasn't been determined yet," said Arthur "AJ" Meyer, SGC vice president at University Park. "From conversations I've had, it may cost over $1 million."

"We're looking for alternate means to fund the repairs, instead of using the [Student Government Association's] accumulated cash balance," Labrador said. "We want to make sure that the students are the primary beneficiaries of the service."

Both councils speculate that the cost of the Aquatic Center will exceed the original estimate of $250,000. The representatives voted to postpone further discussion on the Aquatic Center repairs until the exact total is made available at the next meeting.

"The $1.5-1.6 million dollar total you've heard about is to repair the pool and the diving well," Labrador said. "I can only assume that the problems [with the Aquatic Center] have gotten worse since the budget deliberations, which were in March of 2007."

Katiana "Kathy" Saintable, SGC-BBC president, raised the topic of possible conflict between the Monday, Wednesday and Friday schedule change and the Golden Panther Express bus schedules.

While FIU is implementing the new schedule, the buses that shuttle students between UP and BBC will still be running at their regular times. The buses ran at certain times in order to allow the students to get to classes on either campus on time, Saintable said.

"The problem is that the Monday Wednesday schedules have changed, but the bus schedules have not," she said.

According to Labrador, the original bus schedule would take an hour and 15 minutes to get to either campus, which allowed students to miss only one class if they missed the bus. Under the new schedule, the classes will be 50 minutes long, but the busses will still take an hour and 15 minutes to shuttle back and forth.

"Instead of missing one potential class, you miss two potential classes," Labrador said.

The councils withheld further discussion on the subject until they know for certain that it is a problem for students.

"We don't want to take preemptive measures before knowing if it is a problem," Labrador said. 	

However, Micah Mintz, a graduate student who was guest at the meeting, suggested that both councils conduct a survey to see if students believe that there will be a bus schedule conflict.

Saintable asked what SGC-UP representatives were doing to increase environmental awareness at their campus, one of the four university-wide goals. She did not mention what actions the SGC-BBC was taking, although Meyer complimented SGC-BBC for printing on both sides of the paper in order to limit paper waste.

SGC-UP is planning a "Green Day," a day to heighten environmental awareness, for their campus. SGC-UP has not set up an exact date for the "Green Day," but they did confirm that they are speaking to Jeff Corwin, an active environmental conservationist and television show host, to speak at the event.

The council representatives voted on a panther head design for the t-shirts that are going to be given to the freshmen of the class of 2011. They also voted to use gold as the only color on the design if using two different colors proves to be too expensive.

Meyer mentioned the creation of a telecommunications system to connect both campuses. It will cost $40,000 to establish this system, said Meyer. Meyer did not mention any other specifics about the system as it may still not be feasible.

Meyer said a constitutional change will allow the election dates to be moved to an earlier time in order to allow the president-elect and vice president-elect to have a say in the this year's budget hearings. Meyer did not mention a specific date for the earlier elections.

The next University-wide meeting is scheduled for Aug. 23 at noon at UP.

Headline: Model of Health...a wellness coloumn: Managing stress levels begins with managing one's life
Author: Sandra Mateu / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As we all have experienced, some more than others, the side effects of stress can be worse for the body then the causes of stress to the mind. Continuous headaches, lower back and neck pains, insatiable hunger or uncontrollable weight loss are some of those tricky results of poor stress management. What would our lives be like without these annoying pains and symptoms? 

According to Dr. Melissa Conrad Stöppler, a U.S. board-certified Anatomic Pathologist, on Medicinenet.com, "Elimination of stress is unrealistic, since stress is a part of normal life. It's impossible to completely eliminate stress and it would not be advisable to do so. Instead, we can learn to manage stress so that we have control over our stress and its effects on our physical and mental health."

Now that a semester is ending and a new one is looming, it's an ideal time to regroup yourself - especially with finals around the corner.

While it's true that today's world is more complicated than yesterday's, that's no reason for stress to manage your life. But first, let's define stress.

"Stress may be considered as any physical, chemical or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental unrest and that may be a factor in disease causation," Stöppler said. 



How do you know if you're experiencing stress?



The American Institute of Stress (AIS) lists 50 common signs and symptoms, which include frequent headaches, neck ache, back pain, muscle spasms, sweating, blushing, poor sexual desire and anxiety. 

Sometimes you may experience a few symptoms separately or a combination of many. Whatever the case may be, the key is to know that they are stress symptoms and identify the source.



What can cause stress?



There are a lot of factors that could contribute to anxieties in your life. According to eMedicineHealth.com, a first aid and consumer health information site, family history or even a traumatic experience (known as Post-traumatic stress) can create stress. 

If you are able to remove the source of the stress, which is rare, do it.

If an exam, event, job, or situation is causing you stress, you may create a series of steps to make it more approachable and easier to solve. 

If it is a test that is bothering you, design a plan where you can study little by little everyday and advance toward your goal. 

If you do not have a job, dedicate some hours of your day to search on the Internet, go to events, make connections and work with the problem. By not doing anything, the problem gets bigger and you feel guiltier. 



Why manage stress?



Stress has to be taken care of in its early stages because it can have dangerous consequences on, for example, your immune system. 

When you are weak, you become more vulnerable for diseases and less productive, which will cause you more stress. 

According to the AIS, "there are numerous emotional and physical disorders that have been linked to stress including depression, anxiety, heart attacks, stroke, hypertension and immune system disturbances ... "

To get your mind off of stress, Stöppler recommends exercise, relaxation, meditation and Yoga. 

The AIS also recommends activities such as jogging and aromatherapy.

From all these recommendations, you need to apply the ones that work for you because each person is different and consequently reacts differently. 

Above all, in order for stress to be managed, you have to actively seek activities and the motivation to help yourself.

Headline: Review: Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword (Game)
Author: Kevin Castro / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Considered the 2005 Strategy Game of the Year by gaming web sites such as IGN.com and Gamespot.com, Civilization 4 found its way into homes with its offering of addictive gameplay and an immersive world. In Civilization 4, you take command of an entire nation in 4000 B.C., expanding your boundaries through peace or war.

Now, the second expansion pack to the Civilization franchise, Beyond the Sword, has been released and offers an overwhelming amount of content, including new units, technologies and buildings.

There are 11 new scenarios for gamers to experience such as Final Frontier, Fall from Heaven, and Next War - three of the most eagerly awaited scenarios; Final Frontier takes place in space and Next War introduces powerful units and new technologies.

With 11 new scenarios come 16 new leaders and 10 new civilizations that allow greater freedom, especially when you're choosing leaders based on their traits and characteristics that give in-game bonuses.

If you want gold, BTS's new corporation feature allows you to form a major corporation to make some money. To create one of these money-making machines, you must meet the required technologies and resources. As you spread the corporation, your opponents' cities pay the costs and you receive the gold.

In the original Civilization 4, espionage was disregarded and underrated. In BTS, espionage has been completely overhauled. You can now accumulate espionage points and perform espionage missions that involve poisoning your enemies' water supply or even starting a city revolt.

In real life, a nation isn't always stable, so BTS presents random events that occur throughout the game, ranging from a wedding between members of two nations or a volcanic eruption. If you happen to hate having to endure a seemingly everlasting-game, then just buy everything you would have had through the advanced start feature. This allows you to skip 6000 years while having a powerful empire. 

The visual graphics and sound in this latest expansion have been extravagantly updated and deserve recognition. Civilization 4 was and still is a great game, and this expansion pack makes it even greater with loads of new content and features to play around with. Because of the innovative new features as well as the introduction of fun novel scenarios, Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword truly is the largest Civilization expansion in the franchise's history.

Headline: Review: Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s (Game)
Author: Eddie Zeng / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Game publisher Red Octane and developer Harmonix are rocking American audiences with their juggernaut hit series Guitar Hero, which involves rocking and strumming the five button plastic Gibson SG guitar controller.  

With the recent change in developers (Activision's Neversoft division will be developing Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock) and Harmonix working on the upcoming Rock Band project, Harmonix have decided to end their Guitar Hero tenure with an expansion that is pretty mediocre.

For those eagerly awaiting the release of Guitar Hero III and needing an '80s music fix, Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s is an expansion to Guitar Hero II with an '80s theme, from the characters, venues and even the music.

Since the whole point of the game is to highlight songs from the '80s, there are only 30 songs available to play, ranging from artists such as The Police to Iron Maiden. Five of the 30 songs are listed as "Master Tracks" in which they are the original songs performed by the artists themselves. Basically, you will be jamming to the original version of Twisted Sister's "I Wanna Rock" or Flock of Seagulls "I Ran (So Far Away)" instead of a cover version that would make you rip your ears out. 

Game play remains the same as in Guitar Hero II: pick a song and your difficulty, ranging from easy to expert, and rock out with your "Star Power" for more points in the song. Performing guitar techniques such as the Hammer-on or Pull-off are easier to perform.  Also, the appearance of three note chords makes a return. Multiplayer and Practice modes are still in there so you and a friend can have some epic guitar duels if you choose. 

After playing through all of the 30 tracks in this game, the quality of some cover songs were not so accurate. Some of the fret (note) patterns were fun to play, but the songs can be a headache to hear.  Although some characters and venues were given the '80s makeover, everything else remained the same. 

A $50 price tag for 30 songs and few unlockables is too pricey - this game should have been sold for less. Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s will keep you playing for a while, but you'll want to go back to Guitar Hero II eventually.

Headline: Review: Grim Grimoire (Game)
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Last time we saw developer Vanillaware, they wowed PS2 owners with the 2-D action/role-playing game Odin Sphere. With its latest release, Grim Grimoire, Vanillaware has created a unique experience that delves into the normally PC-dominated real-time strategy genre.

Grim Grimoire tells the story of young magician, Lillet Blan, and her studies at a magic academy known as the Tower of Silver Star. Within five days of her arrival and meeting with Professor Gammel Dore, the Archmage Calvaros attacks the school and all the inhabitants of the school are dead except for Lillet, who finds herself caught in a temporal loop, re-living the five fateful days leading up to the attack. As she relives the past, she must try to figure out the mysteries behind the time loop and the connection to the Philosopher's Stone. 

 Harry Potter references aside, the story starts up pretty quickly and moves along a simple path - you watch characters exchange dialogue to move the story and then participate in battles.  Battles play out on a two-dimensional map where you can create runes to manufacture units for resource gathering, defense, combat and support as well as issue commands to your army in an attempt to destroy the enemy.  Upgrading your runes can bestow new skills to your existing units and allow for the creation of new ones.  

The game's units are standard fantasy fare: mythological beings ranging from smaller creatures such as imps and fairies to colossal golems and dragons that can take up a fourth of the screen.  All the units are divided into four opposing magic schools and are further divided between Substance (physical beings) and Astral (ghosts and phantoms), each with their own abilities, advantages and weaknesses; for example, attacks from substance creatures are practically ineffective against astral types.

For a real-time strategy game on a home console lacking mouse and keyboard support, Grim Grimoire manages to control well and is accessible to any player.  The first loop of the five days serve as the game's tutorial showing the basics and the main campaign is pretty lengthy; the extra bonus missions provide an added challenge. 

Because the game allows for many units to be on screen at once, it can be easy to lose track of units in the clutter, but the use of the directional pad allows for easy cycling through all units on screen as well as selecting units of the same kind for group formation and issuing commands

	On the presentation side, Grim Grimoire does not disappoint.  All the units are very detailed and noticeable even amidst the chaos of battle (and some slowdown), although the backgrounds do become repetitive.  Full voiceovers help give life to the characters, and composer Hitoshi Sakimoto from Odin Sphere once again does a fine job of providing the music score.

PC RTS games have evolved throughout the years, making Grim Grimoire seem archaic at times, but Vanillaware did their best while incorporating their unique style.  In the end, RTS newcomers and veterans alike can appreciate the work that is Grim Grimoire and we can only wonder what Vanillware will bring us next.

Headline: Review: Riviera: The Promised Land (Game)
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Two years ago, publisher Atlus and developer Sting brought us a surprising role-playing hit on the Game Boy Advance. Now, Riviera: The Promised Land is back on the PlayStation Portable for us to discover for the first time or enjoy once again.

The land of Riviera is caught in the middle of a war between angels and demons.  Ein, a Grim Angel in service of the gods, must now save Riviera and end the war once and for all; it's a simple tale with plenty of intrigue that will keep players captivated throughout the game's eight chapters.

The game has a simple method of progression. There is no free movement in the game, but players have two modes of exploration. "Move" mode allows for travel to adjacent spots on the map, while "look" mode allows for interaction with characters and other points of interest on the screen, often leading to information, items, enemies and new paths. Although it is restricting, the game offers much to seek and find and allows for the story to carry the game as much as the mechanics do.

Combat is handled in turn-based fashion with an emphasis on careful equipment use.  Players must choose four items from a limited carrying capacity. Since most items have a limited amount of uses and different effects depending on which character uses it, players must manage their gear with caution.  

Adding more strategy is the use of a three-tiered gauge that fills as the fight continues. Characters have attacks that use varying levels, including deadly Execution Level skills that destroy the gauge for the duration of combat. Enemies also have a similar meter in which they can use special attacks of their own. Characters can learn new skills and increase their stats through multiple uses of certain items and can train without exhausting their inventory while obtaining new items in the process.  While combat is simple to grasp, the strategic elements of your inventory and skills add an interesting challenge.

Even though there have been no outstanding changes from the GBA original, at least gameplay-wise, Riviera does benefit aesthetically from the PSP's capabilities.  The graphics have received a nice facelift along with spell effects and redrawn art.  The sounds of Riviera have been upgraded with a redone soundtrack and fully spoken dialogue for all characters.  While this version of the game does suffer with the PSP's loading times, it does not detract too much from the experience.  With multiple endings and other extras to find such as an art and music gallery, Riviera offers plenty of replay value while already boasting an extensive quest.



With Riviera now available on both major handheld consoles, RPG players owning either platform can enjoy this classic adventure and, presentation differences aside, no one misses out on the simple yet well-executed gameplay and classic story that drives Riviera to be something memorable.

Headline: ACADEMIC AGONY: FIU faces  long-term academic penalties
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
No school in Division 1 will lose more scholarships this year than FIU. A total of twelve scholarships will be lost due to inadequate graduation rates calculated by the NCAA. However, the Athletic Department is making changes toward improving and preventing FIU from meeting academic standards.

The Academic Progress Rate is a system implemented by the NCAA in order to assure that athletic programs are graduating their players up to a fixed standard.

"We have not met the standard the NCAA put in there," said Athletic Director Pete Garcia."

APR is a system that is calculated by giving points to each team based on the number of players in respectable academic standing and on the number of players who remain in the institution.

The minimum score a team can record without losing any scholarships is 925, which indicates that the team's athletes earned 92.5 percent of all possible points and that the team is on track to graduate 50 percent of its athletes. 

If a team scores less than 900, it cannot replace scholarships even if an academically ineligible player leaves the team.

"Unfortunately, the way the APR is it keeps holding that data," Garcia said. "It takes a number of years to dig yourself out of that hole, but this administration has made a commitment to not let that happen again." 

This year, three FIU teams scored less than 900: baseball, football and men's basketball. Due to the low scores, FIU will lose nine scholarships in football, two in men's basketball and one in baseball. 

Baseball scored the worst, with 850, and was placed in the top 10 percentile nationally, which means that 90 percent of Division 1 schools were better at graduating players.

"Receiving help graduating players was a long time coming," said former FIU baseball head coach Danny Price. "This past year was the best year academically. Help was being given away like Kool-aid."

The basketball team scored 870, and the football team scored 889.

The NCAA currently has retrieved nine scholarships from FIU. The remaining three scholarships will be lost in the Fall.

The Athletic Administration has made decisions to make sure that its athletes do not lose any more scholarships in upcoming years. 

The Athletic Department hired a consultant firm, Bond Schoeneck King. Garcia says they reviewed all of FIU's academic systems including personnel and our resources. 

Legal Counsel Christina Mendoza is the architect of a plan approved by President Modesto A. Maidique. Mendoza was not available to comment on the plan due to a visit to Tallahassee, but Garcia says the plan is one of the measures the administration is taking in order to amend the past administration's errors.

"We've made a commitment for student-athletes to be able to take financially 15 credits instead of 12 during their regular terms," Garcia said. "We've also made a commitment for student-athletes to be able to take summer classes."

Price states that in past years, it was difficult for student-athletes to take summer classes, but that this year summer classes were offered to those athletes whether they needed it or not. 

Former golden panther baseball infielder Brian Pullin said that the coaches and administration stressed academics equally every year at FIU. 

However, the last few years he said he saw administration help students more.  

"My last year, the academic center had so many resources," said Pullin. "At that point I already knew what I was doing, but that extra help would've helped me out when I was younger."

The amount of services available to students dictated how athletes would perform in the classroom more than the coaches according to Pullin.

In addition to the APR, the NCAA is taking note of what type of initiatives schools are taking to losing scholarships. 

It is possible to appeal past APR scores, but Garcia stresses the importance of looking ahead.

"We could appeal, but we're looking toward the future," he said.

&nbsp;
As the ever exciting time of year that is college football approaches, many questions need to be answered for your very own Golden Panthers if they wish to exit the basement of Division I-A football. 

Currently ranked 117 out of 119, according to a poll on ESPN.com, and winless since Division 1-A status, FIU's football team has promised that it has turned the page on its troubled past, from the program's direction a player discipline to the infamous brawl with UM.

Rookie head coach Mario Cristobal has promised to expect many changes that range from head coaching responsibilities to its overall mentality. These changes, coupled with the loss of productive players to graduation and the NFL, have left no shortage of questions in their wake.

The most noticeable change that fans can expect will be the installation of the spread offense. This offensive scheme will attempt to maximize the team's weapons and look to improve upon last year's measly numbers. 

Is this new offensive approach going to result in dramatic changes? You can chalk this one up as a critical question that enthusiasts should keep in mind. 

Another question to be solved is that of the quarterback situation. With no proven starter on the roster, Cristobal will have his work cut out for him in determining his offensive general for 2007. 

The competition for the spot is likely to be between sophomore Paul McCall and redshirt freshman Wayne Younger. McCall, who saw limited action in game play last season, played decently in the Spring Game back in April, but his performance was overshadowed by the upstart Younger who put up impressive numbers. 

Wayne finished the game with two touchdown passes and 80 rushing yards in leading the offense to a 28-17 win. If Younger continues to impress in camp and show the grit that Cristobal desires, the job is his to win. Will McCall pull off the upset or will Younger outlast him? 

As far as the running game goes, FIU will also focus on solidifying this position in the upcoming weeks. Junior A'mod Ned led FIU with 445 rushing yards last season, but had seemingly lost his status as the incumbent starter to fellow junior Julian Reams, but Ned's job hasn't officially been taken from him. Reams had 104 carries for 325 yards and three touchdowns last season. Who will assume the starting position or will a dual back system be used?

With the above critical positions to be determined, FIU will look to tackle other positions. Sophomore receiver Ashlyn Parker is coming off an impressive season in which he was honorable mention All-Sun Belt Cnference. 

He is currently the leader in receptions for a returning receiver as he had 23 last season and will be counted on heavily to produce after the losses of wide receivers Chandler Williams and tight end Samuel Smith. 

To compensate for the loss of former defensive end Antwan Barnes, strong defensive line play will be counted on as well. Juniors Jarvis Penerton and Jonathan Betancourt impressed in the Spring Game and strong play will help make up for the loss. 

With all these unanswered questions in the next few weeks, a knowledgeable fan of college football must be extremely patient as a supporter of this program. This is quite evident with the current commitments and actions that have recently been taken. 

Cristobal was hired to flush out old mentalities and habits in what were the past few years of this already young program. FIU football has posted an 8-25 record since its 2002 inception. Another commitment to keep in mind is the refurbishing of the new stadium, which is expected to be completed in time for the 2008 season. 

Cristobal's hiring and the new stadium clearly show the desire the Athletic Department has to improve the football program. Even though certain games on this year's schedule may look daunting (see Penn State, Maryland, UM and Kansas), these games against upper tier teams will only benefit the team in the long run due to the exposure it will be receiving. 

So as this exciting time of year approaches, FIU football fans can only hope that these questions are answered by opening kick off.

Headline: Setup of sporting events a crucial, overlooked process
Author: Darren Collette / Contributing Writer 
&nbsp;
This coming Fall, FIU Athletics will embark on another season of Division I NCAA sports. What many may not be aware of is the amount of preparation involved that allows all the teams to play throughout the season.

The Facilities Department  is in charge of setting up sporting events. It handles everything from basketball at the Pharmed Arena to setting up outdoor sports including baseball, soccer, track and even swim meets at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Setting up the Pharmed Arena for a basketball game will normally take a crew of two to three workers about three hours.

The bulk of the work involves pulling out the bleachers and setting up the score keeping equipment. Moving one of the massive baskets can take up to five minutes.  

Perhaps the most challenging tasks the department has is setting up the numerous high school graduations, which are held every year at the Pharmed Arena. 

"When we do graduations it's more of a full day setup. We start in the morning and put the carpets down. Then we go to the stage to get the drapes that go all the way around - it's quite an extensive setup," said John Eckart, assistant director for Facilities.

This football season is going to be played in the Orange Bowl due to the ongoing construction of the FIU stadium and the Golden Panthers will play University of Miami on Sept. 15. 

Working with the Orange Bowl staff will bring some changes since its own staff will do most of the setup. 

According to Robert McDaniel, assistant athletic director for Facilities, "When we do the events at the Orange Bowl we're responsible for setting up sponsors signs and the instant replay set-up. 

We set up the instant replay equipment and they have officials that come in and run it." 

Event setup is not all moving basketball hoops and preparing bleachers, though. The ticket office takes part in an essential part of setup. 

The office handles sales and fans wanting to buy seats for events, it is also in charge of the giant inflatable Roary that football players run out through during the beginning of each game. 

"It will take us about 10 to 15 minutes to inflate it then it takes a good 20 minutes to deflate and wrap it up," said Drew Agueste, the FIU ticket office manager. "Sometimes it takes a half hour just to push all the air out."

The ticket office will also setup tables and attend to the needs of visiting teams. It also tries to get more people to the games by offering deals like two sets of season tickets for $100 for students and $50 for faculty. 

The offer will be in effect this season at the Orange Bowl and for the 2008 season when the new stadium is complete.

Headline: T.V. TROUBLE: Television used to manipulate consumers' purchasing habits
Author: Joy Clahar / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
What is the impact of television on your life as an American?  The important thing to understand is that the primary purpose of television is to advertise to the public, not to entertain, to inspire, to enrich, or to empower.  

The big screen at the focus of your entertainment center is not intended to bring you what you want but to make you think that you want or need something you do not already have. It is a constant manipulation of your emotions by so much more than just a stream of commercials.

Have you ever taken the time to think about the effect of local news on the psyche?  What does it accomplish, knowing that Paris Hilton went to jail, a store was held up, and someone was killed.  It's summertime in South Florida and that means a number of things. For those of us who don't work nine-to-five jobs, going outside during the day is only done when absolutely necessary and the air conditioner is on at full blast along with the television. 

According to the A.C. Nielsen Co., the average American watches more than four hours of T.V. each day - or 28 hours/week, which equates to two months of nonstop T.V.-watching per year. In a 65 year lifespan, that person will have spent nine years glued to the tube. There is so much else to do, like prepare for a better job, read, write or learn a new language.

But for most people, television inevitably leads to only one activity: spending.  You may think of television as cheap, convenient entertainment but the producers are making money because businesses are willing to pay them large sums to keep you in your seat for their commercials. Since they know that the public is there, waiting receptively for the return of their favorite show, they can sell you anything from toilet paper to prescription drugs. 

College students are especially targeted by the media and because of their youth they are easily influenced. If a college student becomes a buyer of a disposable product, they will possibly be for life. Are you deciding how you spend your money or is someone else?  

The ability of the media to manipulate the public should not be underestimated. In his book, An Assault on Reason, Al Gore gave an example of how this power is used not only to sell Downy toilet tissue but to influence voting patterns. 

During his campaign  for the presidency, campaign advisors were able to ensure Gore an 8.5 percent increase in the polls. This was all possible due to the implementation of mass advertisement schemes, which increased exposure and showed just how influential adverstising could be. 

There are companies, such as  A.C. Nielsen Media, whose business it is to collect and deliver data on the demographics of television programming and commercial viewing to local stations, broadcast networks and, most significantly, advertisers. According to their web site, measurement is only the beginning. The advertiser Services group provides 'unparalleled and objective third-party insight into the media activity of advertisers and their competitors.' 

Television, like almost anything else, can be a good thing when used in moderation. There is a variety of programming that educates on everything from history and engineering to nature and biographies. I was shocked the other day when my cousin's five year old daughter explained evaporation to me and told me that she had learned it from a kid's television show.  

There are entire channels dedicated to inspiring creativity in the kitchen, home improvement projects, and even adding a bit of spice to any wardrobe.  But after getting a few ideas, true learning and fun comes from what you do with them,  

But no amount of technical equipment or data analysis could give advertisers the power to achieve their goals without the consent of their viewers.  

Do you want to earn a 4.0 GPA this semester, own your own home by age thirty, get in shape, have a healthier diet or even help stop global warming?  Whatever your dream, ask yourself: is being in front of the 50 inch television right now getting me closer or farther away? 

The next time you sit before that lovely plasma screen in your living room just remember one thing: you are not just watching it, it is watching you.

Headline: Editorial: Anonymous donation stirs up questions and concerns
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
FIU has been given an anonymous donation for its medical program. The $5 million donation from a generous benefactor, whose identity remains shrouded in uncertainty seems something out of the ordinary. 

This may seem entirely beneficial and in the interest of this institution however, the most alarming aspect of this donation is the unflinching insistence of both the administration and the donor to prevent any details from leaking and compromising the secrecy of this whole process. 

Following the loss of what could have been the largest donation contributed to FIU's medical school, it seems that the effects of desperation are starting to plague University President Modesto A. Maidique. 

Maidique, who was involved in the negotiation of a $20 million donation from Dr. Herbert Wertheim (which was later revoked), not only managed to tarnish the University's relationship with one of it's most generous benefactors but also succeeded in losing $40 million in potential funds, once the state's matching donation was taken into consideration. 

In a letter written to Wertheim several months ago, Maidique stated that Wertheim was getting the naming rights to the medical school "on the cheap," and thought other donors would line up to pay $100 million for such a privilege. 

Eight months later, FIU has yet to find an individual or corporation interested in purchasing the naming rights to the College of Medicine. 

In what seems to be an attempt to make amends for past mishaps, Maidique has accepted an anonymous donation, which apparently carries terms just as cryptic as the donor. 

What is alarming is the fact that a public institution adamantly refuses to disclose the source of these funds, and that the acceptance of the funds is entirely dependent on an assurance of anonymity.

The necessity of public awareness is becoming ever more necessary, now that the state is going to utilize public funds, contributed by the tax payers of Florida, to match the donation, which could have come from anywhere. 

The sheer fact that the University agreed to undergo a lifetime liability for two insurance claims, only serves to raise even more red flags. It leads to speculation on the part of the general public, who are left to ask many questions. 

Administration is making no effort to quell such suspicions, with the Office of Media Relations refusing to comment on the specifics of the donation. 

Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that Maidique did not share transcripts of the legal analyses he allegedly received, with the Board of Trustees. To the uniformed observer, these would appear to be efforts to conceal the truth.

The administration should be more forthcoming in elaborating on the details of this donation, as it is within the interest of the general public and the student body to know. 

This is a public university that is funded by public dollars and is subject to Florida's Sunshine Laws, as such, anyone so inclined to inquire has the right to know the details of this information. 

This private donation made by a private individual or corporation is going to be matched dollar for dollar with taxpayers money.

Ambiguous terms that may inconvenience the University in the future, should not be agreed to in what might seem to be a desperate attempt to raise money. 

Other donors will come, who are reputable and generous enough not only to reveal themselves, but who also will not burden the university with dubious stipulations.

Headline: Anonymous donor offers $5 million
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
The terms may be unclear, but FIU's Board of Directors accepted on July 25 an anonymous potential donation of $5 million for its new medical school.

Presented with only an oral statement from University President Modesto Maidique, the board not only accepted the cash donation, but according to The Miami Herald, it also assumed a "lifetime liability on two insurance claims" as a term for the gift.

It is not fully understood what this could mean for FIU, and Director of Media Relations Maydel Santana-Bravo said that she was not in the position to describe this special condition to The Beacon. 

The Miami Herald also reported that Maidique reviewed the offer with attorneys, determining that the only risk associated with this donation is a $10,000 administrative fee. 

Santana-Bravo could not comment as to what the fee would pay for, or where the funds would come from.

Though unconfirmed, Maidique also said the donor may have an endowed professorship named, which would allocate funds to help recruit top professors to FIU.

"Endowed professorships give the University a chance to attract a star in a field," Santana-Bravo said.

Currently, Santana-Bravo said that the donor is in the process of making a final decision. If the gift is made, FIU will qualify for a matching gift from the state.

When the gift is complete, the donor's identity may be revealed.

"I don't know why the donor has remained anonymous, but I do believe he will eventually be identified," Santana-Bravo said.

Headline: Climate conscious: Dean explores sound art in South Pole
Author: Nicole Acosta / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
When Lesley A. Northup became the interim dean of The Honors College a year ago, she needed to find someone to replace her as associate dean. Eventually, Juan Carlos Espinosa was hired for the position in the fall of 2006. His qualifications: his previous experience at Miami-Dade College's Office of the President and being a "Renaissance Man" involved with politics and sound art.

"We want people [on the faculty] who are in themselves what honors students in the Honors College should be, and [Espinosa] is a very good model for that," Northup said. "He's a very conscientious mentor who works closely with his students one on one to get job interviews and scholarships. Teachers who love teaching are usually the best teachers."

Espinosa said he has two passions, one of them being his academic political science background and his teaching, the other being his sound art.

Born in Cuba in 1959, he migrated to Miami when he was six-years-old. After years of public schooling in Miami, Espinosa went on to earn a bachelor of arts degree in international relations from Florida State University in 1981. 

After coming back to the United States to live in San Francisco for some time, Espinosa came back to Miami to teach in the mid 1980's and went on to earn his masters degree at the University of Miami in 1995 and then his doctorate in international relations and comparative politics at the University of Miami.

Throughout this time, Espinosa was involved in Cuban and Cuban American studies, eventually becoming one of the founders of the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at UM and going on to give political commentary on the subject.

"I was not particularly interested in Cuban history and culture until I went to college. Later, I became obsessed with the history and culture of Republican Cuba. My passion is more a curiosity as to how Cuba ended up living under dictatorships for most of its history with the current one being the longest and most destructive. On a more personal level, it's a curiosity mixed with sadness and frustration," Espinosa said. 

It was his background in international relations that has prompted Espinosa to teach the overall theme of "Aesthetics, Values and Authority: The Art of War" to his third year Honors College students last year.

According to Espinosa, his course looks at war through a cultural lens by studying war and its themes through television, film, video games, music videos and national anthems. 

One example of a medium used to interpret the Cold War and Vietnam War in Espinosa's class were Star Trek episodes, which showed how the conflicts were being carried out through popular mediums at the time.

"The study of video games which seems non-traditional and is of great importance and great influence today and the fascinating thing is that what we're seeing in this new media the same symbols, imagery, archetype and iconic images [used throughout history]," Espinosa said. 

Espinosa also has a classical music section in the class, which allows him to incorporate his academic expertise with his second love: composing music.

"I really enjoy the classical music section and obviously it was a contemporary interest with what we're living with in the world today whether its the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. And by looking at these things through the past I am hoping it will give me and the students insights into understanding or interpreting what we're living through," Espinosa said.

Espinosa's most recent work integrates his academic background with his sound art which lately consists of social commentary on the environment or trying to understand what he calls a sense of place.

Espinosa traveled to Antarctica with Xavier Cortada, a Miami-based artist, last January in order to add his sound art to Cortada's visual art projects.

One of the projects Espinosa collaborated on with Cortada, called "Longitudinal Installation," consisted of Cortada placing 24 shoes in a circle around the South Pole. Each shoe represented a person affected by global climate change in each latitude. 

Espinosa added sound art to the project by with sounds he recorded around McMurdo station in Antarctica, and added a collage of people speaking on the radio in each latitude of the world to the piece.

Cortada said he and Espinosa made a great team, working together on these socially-conscious projects now on a United Nations exhibition touring the world.

"By having a sound board and someone you can talk to and look at an issue together enhances the art because it's greater than the sum of its parts," Cortada said. "There was great synergy when both of us were working with each installation and I look forward to working with him at our next installation at the North Pole."

Headline: 'Disaster relief' status granted
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Living under constant threat of tropical storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, the FIU community was pleased to be granted status as a Disaster Relief University by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as FEMA, on March 20.

"A lot of universities applied for the DRU status," said Carolyn Robertson, assistant director of the International Hurricane Research Center. "But they didn't get it."

The program was established in 2000, and FIU is the first public university in Florida to receive the DRU status. Having this designation allows FIU to request grants from a $100 million fund from the federal government. Only DRU designated universities can apply for any portion of this fund.

"It opens a door that allows us to compete for substantial federal funds," said President Modesto A. Maidique.

According to Maidique, the funds FIU could obtain from FEMA are crucial.

"With these funds we can make improvements such as securing climate control systems that are vital for many of our laboratories, and installing impact resistant windows in key areas," Maidique said in a July 25 university-wide e-mail. 

"We've already identified $12 million in possible mitigation plans," Maidique said. 

DRU recipients can receive $3 million per mitigation project they undertake. The need for the program comes from the potential loss of billions of dollars during a disaster. One of the first steps in applying for the DRU status was identifying the hazards at FIU and taking an inventory of its assets.

"There are a lot of one-of-a-kind objects you can't replace in our library," Robertson said.

Robertson also stressed the importance of the PantherSoft system.

"If something were to happen to PantherSoft, the backbone of the University would be affected," Robertson said. 

Not wanting to take any chances with gaining the DRU status, Robertson, along with Jennifer Mwaisela, associate vice president of risk management and environmental health and safety, brought in outside help from two engineering firms: URS and PBS & J.

These firms were contracted to identify risk areas as well as to establish the mitigation plans that determines what level of protection to assign to buildings around campus. 

Robertson and Mwaisela also established an advisory council consisting of faculty, staff, professors and students.

"We rated [the structures on campus] in order of importance to protect," said R. Bruce Dunlap, a chemistry and biochemistry professor who sat in the council. "We wanted to show FEMA that we'd done our homework."

The process took the council almost two years to complete. 

Maidique, who was not heavily involved with the council, commented that it's no surprise that FIU gained the DRU status given that the International Hurricane Research Center, located at FIU, already spends millions of dollars on research. 

Most of the IHRC funds are federal funds and the center was recently awarded an additional $20 million from the federal government.

There are only 29 DRU designated universities, including FIU.

According to Robertson, after receiving DRU designation, the next step is to look into academic areas to identify the most pressing needs.

"We worked very hard on this," Robertson said. "Now comes the real hard work."

Headline: Senior loses life before graduation
Author: Maria Chercoles / News Director
&nbsp;
Pre-physical therapy senior Daniel A. Matos, 22, died July 18 at his home in Westchester. 

His mother, Trini Blaya, found him dead on his bed hours after he died, when she went to wake him up to go to class. It is estimated that he died at about 10 a.m.

After an autopsy, the cause of death remains unknown. A pathology exam was conducted as well but results can take up to three months.

Matos had spent the night before playing video games at the house of his friend Danny Quinto, who was the last person to see him alive. He got home at 3 a.m., prepared to go to sleep, and lay on his bed with his glasses on.  This is how he was found. 

"He passed away very peacefully in this sleep. There was no struggle, it didn't look like there was any kind of pain," Blaya said.  

His family has ruled out suicide as a possible cause of death.

"There were a lot of things going on in his life that he was looking forward to. I don't think he would be capable of committing suicide," said his sister Lissette Matos, 30.  

Matos, a graduate of Southwest Miami High, would have graduated next fall with a pre-physical therapy bachelor's degree. 

He wanted to get into FIU's physical therapy master's degree program but was not accepted into it. He was considering taking a year off and reapplying next year, his sister said.  

According to Physical Therapy Associate Professor Awilda Haskins, the program is very selective, admitting only 48 students per year. Haskins remembers Matos from a class last spring. 

"He really wanted to get into the program and become a physical therapist," Haskins said. "He was an outgoing and diligent student, and a warm and caring person." 

Matos' family is now trying to get a post-mortem degree from FIU.

"He was about to graduate and it's a shame. He did so much work for it," Lissette Matos said. 

According to FIU student Derek Sorare, who knew him since elementary school, Matos enjoyed the outdoors and nature. Both joined the Boy Scouts in elementary school. While Sorare quit a few years later, Matos continued in the program as long as he could until, according to Sorare, "he was basically kicked out of it because of his age."

Last June, Matos joined Sorare and other friends on a sailing and snorkeling trip through the Florida Keys. 

"It was one of the last exciting things he did," Sorare said. 

While taking classes, Matos also worked at TGI Friday's at the Dolphin Mall, where he is remembered as a caring person who would always stop working to help everyone else. 

Coworker Nely Titart remembers one day when Matos sang Tainted Love in front of everyone else at the restaurant.

"He didn't care what people thought of him," Titart said. 

His sister describes him as an intellectual who enjoyed gadgets, books and games. She remembers going to concerts together, taking turns in paying for the tickets.  Nine Inch Nails was the last concert they went to.

"It was a little thing we had. If he couldn't pay for the ticket, I would get him and he would get me next time," Lissette Matos said.

"His friends were his passion," said Blaya, and added that the funeral procession was so long she had to get extra police forces.

"There might have been over a thousand people there," Blaya said.

Matos was buried Saturday July 21 at the Our Lady of Mercy cemetery in the City of Doral.

In addition to his mother and sister, Matos is survived by a brother, his father, a stepfather and two grandmothers.

Headline: Anime Assembly: Yasumicon celebrates five-year anniversary
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Japanese animation fans will be suiting up as their favorite characters at the fifth annual Yasumicon Anime convention taking place Aug. 11 and 12 in the Graham Center and Green Library Auditorium. 

Hosted by the Anything Goes Anime Film Club, the convention is expected to achieve its highest attendance numbers ever.

"We're free - that's our biggest pull," said General Director Edwin Perodin.

Yasumicon, composed of numerous concerts, contests and vendors, is a showcase of all things Japanese culture. 

Unlike past years, the 2007 convention has a defined, concrete theme: Natsu Matsuri, which is Japanese for  "summer festival." The name Yasumicon itself stems from the Japanese word "yasumi" meaning "vacation."

 "It's a chance to come together as friends with the same interest," Perodin said. Last year's events included performances by Piano Squall, a musician who plays widely-known video game music on his piano, as well as sushi demonstrations and local shops selling DVDs and other memorabilia. 

This year, AGA is introducing several new features for convention-goers.  

"There are some new attractions like the 'Meido café'," said FIU alumna and Marketing and Public Relations Director Claire Daniels. "Akihabara is where major fans go and have girls in maid outfits serve coffee and Japanese snacks."

Although the girls in maid costumes cater to the male contingency, the convention itself offers cultural events for everyone. 

"I think it's just a stereotype that mostly guys go to conventions," said sophomore Kimberly Marti. "I go to conventions with my friends, who are mostly girls, and I see a bunch of girls at conventions, too."

Many participants take part in one of the convention's largest events: the Cosplay contest. 

Cosplay is a Japanese subculture that involves fans dressing up as their favorite characters from different media such as anime or video games. 

The contest requires that participants have a handmade costume and a live performance.

"People really get into their characters and come up with some wacky costumes," said Cosplay judge Cristian Alvernaz. "This one guy had foam armor and it was really impressive."

Attendees might have the opportunity to meet the voices behind the characters they love. 

Fans such as sophomore Lauren DiGiovanni enjoy meeting voice actors because it gives their favorite character more of an identity.

"I like to meet a character's voice because you can see how the person acts," DiGiovanni said. "You get to see that the way the person acts in real life is just like how the character acts."

Last year's star voice actor was Vic Mignogna, who has voiced lead characters on hits such as Fullmetal Alchemist and D.N.Angel. 

This year's voice actor will be Sonny Strait who is best known for his parts as Krillin from Dragon Ball Z and Maes Hughes from Fullmetal Alchemist.

Also in the flesh will be live musical acts Artbeat, a Japanese-American band, and Select Start, which replays familiar video game songs in classical fashion. 

In addition to the three bands, the Consul General of Japan, Hiroshi Yamaguchi, will be using his violin to interpret anime theme songs.

Despite all of the activities, some people attend the convention just to see familiar faces. 

FIU alumnus Juan Mendez III perceives anime conventions as more of a family gathering. 

"It's a chance to see faces you don't see everyday," Mendez said. "A bunch of us cram into hotels. It's a bonding thing like a family, a chance to goof off and have fun."

Headline: Review: "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" (Book)
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
After more than 10 years of adventure and mystery, the story of Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, is finally over with the release of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." 

In this last adventure, it's up to Harry and his two sidekicks Ron and Hermione to stop He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (Lord Voldemort) once and for all by destroying magical objects called Horcruxes that each contain a portion of Voldemort's soul. To make the mission even harder, the trio are forced into hiding when Voldemort takes over and makes our heroes into wanted criminals. 

To further compound our heroes' troubles, Voldemort spends most of the book looking for one of the  three Deathly Hallows, a magic wand said to be more powerful than any other. The trio of objects were created by Death itself, whose legend says if you have all three objects, will make you the master of death. 

The story is set at a very fast pace, which made "Deathly Hallows" stand out from the other six books in the series by J.K. Rowling. The action and bloodshed starts from the very first chapter and does not stop until the very end, with no breaks in between.

The action was a refreshing spin on the series. In previous installments, there were usually long pauses of side storylines that were not essential to the overall book. In the case of "Deathly Hallows," there are no side plots in the book at all - which will make the movie adaptation in a few years a little tricky. Every single detail builds up to the shocking revelation at the end of the book. And is it a whomping willow of a twist ending. 

One thing that was a big letdown was how Rowling handled death in the book. In past books, each time a character died, it was carefully planned out and had a distinct meaning and impact on the story. But in "Deathly Hollows," death was completely random. Random death was due to Rowling trying to create a sense of war between Voldemort and the forces of good. In war, people die randomly. Many characters die and a lot of the time it seemed like Rowling was doing it for pure shock value. 

 Also, in the final battle, which took place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, screamed, "I am trying to be as epic as Lord of the Rings." The final battle just seemed like a forced epic for some reason. 

Besides the symbolism of death Rowling created, everything else about "Deathly Hallows" lives up to the expectations many readers had for the last Potter book. What was also enjoyable was the fact Rowling didn't leave you with any unanswered questions … until you read the epilogue. 

The epilogue takes place 19 years after the conclusion of the book and leaves you with a lot of questions such as, "What is that person doing now?" 

Hopefully the rumors of Rowling writing a Harry Potter encyclopedia with all the information you could ever want about the characters is true. 

So, for the million-dollar question, does Harry Potter, indeed, become the Boy Who Once Lived? 

For the sake of my own existence, I recommend that all just read the book and find out for yourselves - or you can train in Legimancy aka Google.

Headline: Apple iPhone hits stores
Author: Daniella King / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Pulling up to the Cingular/AT&T store June 29, 2007, registered nurse, Alejandro Garcia, 41, quickly walked into the store ready to make a purchase that he has been waiting months for. The phone was previewed on Apple.com as the "revolutionary phone with multiple features."  Not having much experience with up-to-date technological devices, it sparked his attention to see a device that would contain multiple media features; he jumped at the chance to buy the phone.  As he walked up to the counter, the sales associate announced that the new Apple iPhone was completely sold out. 

This was the problem that many Cingular/AT&T customers' faced trying to buy the new Apple iPhone.  The stores contained a limited amount of phones in stock, which were sold out shortly after going on sale at 6:00pm in 164 stores nationwide, according to the iPhone press release contained on the apple website (apple.com.)  

The iPhone is the new "revolutionary" phone made by Apple.  It is a sleek, palm held phone with a 3.5 inch widescreen that's lets you review your calls or change the song on your ipod.  It allows you to make calls by tapping the name or number in your address book or call log.  The ipod holds multiple multimedia such as music, audio books, videos, tv shows, and movies. It also contains a picture-precise camera and an organizer.  

Another feature that "revolutionizes" the iPhone is its high technology and internet service.  The phone is completely touch screen and its wireless Safari internet contains Google and Yahoo search engines.  

Alejandro Garcia recognizes this capability as a good one because of the differences between the two operating systems.  "There are two types of people, apple people and not apple people," he states, admitting he's a fan of MAC.  

So what's the going price for the new iPhone that contains these features: $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB model, letting you choose the option of syncing it to a MAC or PC. 
The frenzy behind this new piece of technology caused people to take shifts standing at the Cingular store awaiting the iPhone to go on sale.  

Dr. Nathan Hiller, Ph.D in Industrial Organizational Psychology, currently an Assistant Professor of Psychology points out people's need to have the "newest" thing out there.  "Early adopters," the term Dr. Hiller used to describe who crave to have the most exclusive product out, even though there may be glitches.  

He emphasizes that Apple's media presents a rebellion-cool image that draws in the young identity and sex appeal.   
"Apple has been successful in playing out this arrogance in the media.  Everyone wants to be savvy and rebellious by buying this new product to show it off.  And it's worked!"

Reception in different areas is a big concern when it comes to buying a phone.  For Leila Walker, currently a junior at FIU, she admits the reception on the phone is really good.   "I love my phone, it has great reception and I love the features that are included in one phone."

It comes down to one basic question: Is the Apple iPhone worth purchasing? 

For Junior Jensey Rivra, he feels that it was one of the best investments ever.  It gives him the convenience of not having to carry around multiple devices and keeps him organized as well. 

"It's the best investment ever! My planner keeps me super organized and now I'm hardly ever late."

You can purchase an Apple iPhone at the Cingular/AT&T store, online at apple.com, or at the nearest apple location near you.

Headline: Best 'buy back' bargains

With the semester coming to an end, many students are wondering what to do with the stacks of books that have consumed so much of their budgets. From Facebook Marketplace to Booksmart to the FIU Bookstore, each student can find the most convenient way to turn in his/her book for money. Here are some of the places to check out if you're looking to get some money back:

Facebook
	
With a wide range of FIU students enrolled in the popular web site Facebook.com, your chances of selling books are pretty high. According to Veronica Trueba, a journalism major at FIU and an active member of Facebook, the best time to list your book in the Marketplace is two weeks before the semester ends - it's enough time for others to review your books for the following semester.

"The books that have the most success are those that are not falling to pieces, and at least for me, I make sure my books do not look like they are being held by staples when I'm about to list them in Facebook," Trueba said.  

Whether the book is new or used, highlighted or lightly outlined with pencil, it must be stated in the book's information corner along with the price and shipping cost. Pictures of the books you are selling are recommended, and listing your book in Facebook Marketplace is free. 
 
"Not many people see Facebook as a medium to sell books - it is more like a social network," said Trueba "But in reality, Facebook is the new eBay but easier and faster and much more convenient for students enrolled in a university"


FIU Bookstore 
	
After exams, at the end of the semester, everyone seems to spend a good portion of their time crammed in endless lines along the FIU Bookstore.  According to student Laura Dias, there is a very simple answer for this.

"Not only is the FIU Bookstore generous with their book returning policy, but they also provide a wide variety of books that you can turn in.  They rarely reject a book."

Nevertheless, the condition of the books that are being turned in are highly critical.   

"One cannot expect a book to be accepted if it has coffee stains all over or pages missing," said Dias.  

The best time to turn in books at the FIU Bookstore is right after exams, but most of the time they accept books at any time, so there is no need to hurry.  Still, some students want their money back as soon as they finish their finals.

"Through my experience," says Dias, "I learned that waiting in line for a couple of minutes is a small price to pay for such rewarding gain." 

Amazon (Online Site):

Another very popular site among FIU students is Amazon.com.  Many students who are not in hurry to sell their books opt for this site.  

"Their professional attention is rewarding, and in the long run, your book will be sold at the price you want. No questions asked," said Marcia Ramos, a regular visitor of Barnes & Noble and a member of Amazon.com.     

When selling a book through this site, it is important to note the whole book's profiling information, that would give others a better insight on the material, therefore making it easier to be purchased.

Pictures are very important, and many people judge the material according to them.  Amazon takes both new and used books as long as they have a certain description next to them. 

Booksmart:

	The Booksmart across the street from FIU's Southwest 16 street entrance is another option for students who don't want to brave the long lines at the University's own bookstore.

"At the first glance, I did not think Booksmart was going to be my first choice when it came to turning my books in, but once I realized that not many people knew about this place, it was evident that I had an advantage," said Sean Caines an engineering student at FIU who lives close to the campus.  

The best time to turn in books is definitely right at the end of the semester, right when you walk out of your last class, that way it is not too crowded. 

Booksmart accepts both new and used books that are in good condition. Usually the books that get turned in the most are those that are used for required classes, such as English or math books.

Headline: Anime Convention brings color to FIU
Author: Andrew Leins / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On Saturday August 11, futuristic warriors, sorcerers, and crazed schoolgirls invaded FIU as teenagers and adults dressed up carrying swords and chains, with painted hair and strange masks for a celebration of all things Japanese animation, also known as anime.

Yasumicon 2007 was the fifth annual convention where anime fans come to play games, buy merchandise and meet with friends; Japanese animation has developed a growing following in the United States for several years with fans enjoying shows such as Pokemon, Naruto and Sailor Moon. Held in the Graham Center and organized by FIU's student club Anything Goes Anime, the convention included various games and appearances by voice actors, as well as a costume contest and performances by bands such as Rocket Propelled Geeks. 

Attendees ranged from Super Mario, toting a big hammer, Mr. and Mrs. Pacman and a boy dressed as Sailor Moon, a female character; both children and adults dressed up for the function. Teresa Montgomery, Anything Goes Anime President attributes this widespread popularity to the various themes seen in different anime.

"The thing about anime is that there are different themes, there are stories for everyone," Montgomery said.

Ken Jackson, a father who brought his fifteen year old son to the show from Deerfield Beach believed the convention allowed the younger crowd to properly express themselves.

"I think maybe people in the past felt like dressing up but didn't, but these kids actually have the guts to take it to another level," Jackson said.

Montgomery said that a lot of the people who come to this convention are usually timid, but when they come to these types of shows, they have fun and are more sociable. 

"We come to celebrate our nerdiness," Montgomery said.
