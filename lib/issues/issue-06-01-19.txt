Headline: Men's basketball gets romped in Denver
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Men's Basketball team thought the first two games of their road trip could bring them some success. The game against Denver Jan. 14 proved different. 

Denver (10-6, 3-0) dominated FIU (3-13, 0-4) from start to finish and, thanks to poor shooting from the Golden Panthers and a better than average night from behind the arc for the Pioneers, Hamilton Gymnasium saw Denver go atop the Sun Belt West division with an 80-55 romp. 

The Pioneers got better than average performances from forward David Kummer and guard Steve Wetrich, who torched FIU for 15 and 23 points respectively on a combined 10-for-14 shooting and 9-for-11 from behind the three-point arc. 

FIU managed to hold Denver's senior leader Yemi Nicholson in check, allowing him just 16 points and seven rebounds in 29 minutes of play. Coming into the game, Nicholson, the pre-season nominee for conference player of the year, was averaging 19.4 points and 11.3 rebounds per game. 

The Golden Panthers, though being able to contain the Pioneers for the most part on the other end, couldn't get anything going offensively. 

As a team, they shot just 19-for-60 (31.7 percent) from the floor and a dismal  2-for-22 (9.1 percent) from behind the three-point arc. 

Head coach Sergio Rouco once again started a different lineup, choosing to give Elvis Lora and Cesar Chavez-Jacobo their first starts of the season. 

No Golden Panther played more than 26 minutes, with leader Ivan Almonte leading the side with 11 points and nine rebounds in 17 minutes of work. 

Facundo Giorgi, back from injury, and Elvis Lora, who got his first career start, both added nine points a piece, though combined for just 6-for-22 shooting from the floor and 2-for-13 from three-point range.    

Despite out-rebounding their hosts, shooting 15-for-20 (75 percent) from the charity stripe and turning the ball over an uncharacteristic 11 times the Golden Panthers fell by 25 points to extend their losing streak to 11 games. 

FIU drops to 0-8 on the road this season but more importantly 0-4 in the conference. 

Western Kentucky continues their torrid pace atop the east division, having won their last six games - four of which were in the conference, which puts them atop the SBC with a 4-0 record. 

Arkansas-Little Rock and Arkansas State trail them, both have beaten the Golden Panthers at Pharmed Arena so far, with conference records of 2-2 and 2-3 respectively. The Hilltoppers of Middle Tennessee occupy the spot above FIU with a 1-2 conference mark with a game in hand. 

The Golden Panthers head back out on the road Jan. 19, this time to New Orleans as they look to put an end to their road struggles when they face the 5-10 Privateers, who are 2-2 in Sun Belt play.

Headline: Women's tennis returns championship team
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The sun shined brightly Jan. 13, the wind swirled mightily Jan 14 and the cold arrived bitterly Jan. 15, but one thing stayed constant this past weekend: The tennis team opened the 2006 season strongly at the FIU Spring Classic, winning 10 of 20 singles matches and six of nine doubles matches against Illinois, South Florida and the University of Miami. 

Last season, the women earned the school's only Sun Belt Championship and defeated Florida State in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Returning to the court Jan. 13 were all eight members of last season's talented team, making 2006 a year of great expectations.

"We're always looking to have a better year than the year before," said Paula Zabala, the Golden Panthers' No. 1 player, "Go to the Sun Belt Conference and win it one more time."

Zabala got FIU off to a good start against Illinois, defeating Macall Harkings 7-6, 6-4 before teaming with Nikkita Fountain for an 8-5 victory at No. 1 doubles. The 24th-ranked doubles team in the country, Zabala and Fountain pulled off a major upset Jan. 14, defeating 5th ranked Gabriela Duch and Neyssa Etienne of South Florida 8-4. 

"When you go out there you don't really think about what they're ranked,"  Fountain said, who whipped several forehand returns past the Bulls, "You just have to play."

Junior Shilla D'Armas showed her versatility for the Golden Panthers, playing three different singles positions on the weekend. D'Armas edged Miami's No. 2, Melissa Applebaum, 6-4, 1-6, (10-1) Jan. 15, one day after defeating USF's No. 4 Duch 6-2, 6-4. 

For D'Armas, her victory over Duch was bittersweet because the two teamed as doubles partners at the 2002 Yucatan Cup. Playing through brutal winds, D'Armas out-muscled Duch by hitting with heavy top spin to set up her patented backhand down the line.

"I was controlling the points every time by hitting the ball how I could," D'Armas said. "Serving was impossible; I had to serve really slow."

Not slow enough apparently. D'Armas joined seniors Courtney Jonson and Desanka Jovanovic as FIU players to win two singles matches at the Spring Classic. 

Jovanovic breezed past her opponents from Illinois and USF without the loss of a set, dropping only seven games along the way. In her 6-0, 6-2 victory over Luisa Obando of the Bulls, Jovanovic handled the wind brilliantly. She settled into points by mixing up the pace of her shots: slicing backhands and hitting forehands with a heavy top spin. 

 "The girl that I played, she also plays different," Jovanovic said. "She plays spins, she plays slice and she comes to the net. So I just played the same thing and I think I was better. I won 6-0, 6-2 so I was happy because it's hard to play when it's windy."

Also impressive was sophomore Egle Petrauskaite, who fought back from a set down against Courtney Vernon of USF at No. 2 singles. Petrauskaite showed off a fluid backhand, whipping the ball cross court several times to bring Vernon to her knees. 

While Vernon held on for a 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 win, Petrauskaite swept both her singles and  doubles matches against the Fighting Illini.

Bruna Discordia and Marijana Cutuk paired for a doubles win that was years in the making when they beat Pavlina Akritas and Anastasia Sokolova of Illinois 8-2. Both Golden Panthers hail from Croatia and played against each other many times as juniors in their native country. 

Their victory over the Fighting Illini marked their first match as partners.

"It was a lot of fun," Discordia said.

Because the FIU Spring Classic was conducted in a hidden dual format, no team scores were allotted and results counted only for individual records. FIU will open its official season at home against Stetson Feb. 4 at noon. After finishing 2005 with a 19-6 record, the Golden Panthers have high hopes for the new year.

"We should do really well because we're playing well now and we haven't practiced a lot; we just practiced a few days," Jovanovic said. " We should win the conference again; I really think so."

Subheadline: Physical beauty too important
Author: Vivian Cepero / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Whenever I walk into a Publix, I see: non-fat, sugar-free, low-carb, low sugar. At this point, every food imaginable seems to have a "healthier" counterpart. However, we in Miami, can hardly be surprised by this sudden invasion of the low-fat craze. We live in a city obsessed with looks. Thin is in, but thinner is better.

Growing up with someone like my brother, a bodybuilder, teaches one a lot about resistance and it's scary to see how obsessed people are with 'looking good,' whether it be either for themselves or for others. 

According to The National Eating Disorders Association (NEAA), 25 percent of men and 45 percent of women are on a diet on any given day and 80 percent of women are dissatisfied with their appearance. Even more terrifying is the fact that 80 percent of children who are ten-years-old are afraid of being fat. When children begin to be affected directly by this sudden, unrealistic fixation with having a thin body that is when the craze has gone too far.

The simple fact of the matter is that it's ridiculous to expect that anyone can have the perfect body.

Still, let's be practical: It would be dumb to say that when I, or probably any woman, looks at Angelina Jolie or Sienna Miller in their size two couture dresses that there isn't a twinge of jealousy and longing. However, they aren't real. They have highly paid, highly skilled personal trainers and chefs that travel with them.

We live in a sex obsessed, clubbing crazed culture that seems to value the size of your breasts rather than the content of your brain. This is a dangerous path to take but we most probably passed the point of no return a long time ago. 

Let's compare: According to NEAA, the average American woman is 5'4" and 150 pounds. The average model? 5'11" and 117 pounds. 

Seven million women struggle with eating disorders any given day. And for what? For a false sense of satisfaction that can lead to your death?

The ones responsible for this phenomenon don't really care how much you suffer in order to conform into this twisted ideal of beauty. The only way anyone ever really be happy is if they do any diet or exercise for themselves, not for others.

Despite the fact that I have very strong opinions about body image and self esteem, I was, and still am, affected by this influx of what others think my body should be, not what I think that my body should be. 

In the past four months, I have lost thirty pounds by simply not eating all the fried foods I am so fond of. I weakened myself so that I would look good to others. 

 The other day, I felt guilty eating an entire Lunchables simply because I had eaten three full meals a day earlier. I struggle with myself all the time and it upsets me that others have to do so as well.

Fighting the image projected by Hollywood or anywhere else is pretty much a losing battle. What should be done, however, is to see it for what it is: fake. Fake tans, starvation diets, exercising three times a day is nothing that the average woman can or should do. 

If so-called Hollywood beauties didn't have all of their resources, they would be plain Jane, just like you or me.

Medicare program glitches cost recipients more money 

New Medicare's prescription plan was aimed to help low-income people; however, within the first two weeks some seniors and disabled Medicare recipients have learned that the new plan does not cover their medication. Some have been charged full price for their medication or have gone home without their drugs because of computer glitches which show them as unlisted in the Medicare program. 

Pharmacists have spent hours on the phone with Medicare officials explaining to them that their customers are enrolled in the Medicare plan or  that they are being charged the wrong price for their medication. According to Diann Geronemus, a clinical social worker in South Florida, a man was charged $2,500 when the correct amount was $35. 

When Medicare does not cover the medication recipients need, they either must pay out of pocket, appeal to the plan to get the drug covered or switch to another drug or plan - all of which Medicare officials say takes time.

Oldest death row inmate executed

California's oldest death row inmate was executed minutes after his 76th birthday on Jan. 17. Clarence Ray Allen was blind, mostly deaf, wheelchair-bound and had suffered a nearly fatal heart attack in San Quentin State Prison. Allen's lawyers claimed that executing a frail old man would violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment; in addition, the lawyers claim  that the last 23 years Allen spent on death row were also cruel. Allen's request for stay of execution was rejected by the high court 10 hours before the execution. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger also denied Allen clemency.

Allen was arrested for having his teenage son's girlfriend murdered, fearing she would speak of a grocery-store burglary.

Headline: New club offers non-theater majors opportunities
Author: Sergio Carmona / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Four years ago, the medium of theater was introduced to the Biscayne Bay Campus in the form of the Biscayne Bay Dramatics club. The inception of Biscayne Bay Dramatics was a blessing for any student attending BBC as it spared them the hassle of having to make a long drive over to University Park to seek theater participation. 

"Our goal was to help [BBC] students who aren't theater majors because everything associated with theater was in the south campus," said John Morris, club president. "We wanted to bring theater to [BBC]."

Biscayne Bay Dramatics was founded in Spring 2002 for BBC students involved in theater.

"We wanted to help students participate in theater," said Stephen Neal, club advisor. "Our intention was to have all elements of theater for students and audiences of Biscayne Bay."

Before, students had to invest time and gas mileage to become part of the theater, but now that participation has been transformed to a suitable one for students, all they need to do is walk over to the Mary Ann Wolfe Theatre.

 "I'm a [BBC] student," said Adam Aronson, FIU graduate who was treasurer of the club while he was studying for his BA. "I live by there and that's much more convenient."       

The club has produced plays such as "The Odd Couple" in November  2002, 'Paradise" in November 2003 and "Beyond Therapy" in 2004, drawing anywhere from 30-70 people for their plays. 

Although the club hasn't produced a play in two years, they have produced special events like open-mic nights, for which it won a Student Organizations Council award and typically draw around 30 people.However, the club is starting to get its act together with the production of the play "Butterflies are Free" in Feburary.  

"I've gotten a lot of people on the e-mail list," said Morris. " We've had some successful events like the open-mic nights."

The open-mic nights have also presented On-Point poetry, an event where members get to recite poetry or perform improv. Another event that the club sponsors is Theatre Appreciation Day, where the actors show students what the club is about by performing monologues and short skits. 

 "The club has been a success," said Neal. "We have helped raise the awareness of theater at Biscayne Bay."

One of the keys to the club's achievement is their promotion. Officers would recruit students during class time or orientation. 

"I went over to a couple of classes in the Fall and got a couple of new members off that," Morris said. 

Club members meet each Thursday afternoon, but scheduling conflicts have become an issue for members and the time for the meetings in the Spring is still to be determined. 

"We've had meetings where we're lucky to get two people and some where we'd have fifteen to twenty, " Morris said. "We'll try to do whatever the bulk of the club can do, if we can do two meetings, that's fine."

Students interested in joining should contact Morris at (305) 336-1362 or Vice President Heather Callan. There is no membership fee.

FIU alumni are also welcome to join.

"We can always use more people," Morris said. "One of our goals is for more participation."

Headline: Speaker welcomed at MLK breakfast
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A diverse group of over 555 students, teachers and members of the community gathered together to answer a call on Jan. 13: a call to consciousness.  

The 15th Annual Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast was held on the morning of Jan. 13 in the Graham Center ballrooms. 

Guests filed in to listen to the guest speaker, Kweisi Mfume, former U.S. Congressman and former president of the NAACP.  

This was a first time in attending for junior Alexine Jeannit, who was also an usher at the breakfast.  

"I had heard of Mr. Mfume before and I really wanted to hear him speak because he is such a strong voice for the black community and human rights," said Jeannit. 

Senior director of Multicultural Programs and Services, Bob Coatie began the ceremonial breakfast with an introduction honoring the, 'proverbial writers and doers of history as it pertained to the civil rights movement' names ranging from Rosa Parks to Coretta Scott King.

  Guests continued to come in even after the breakfast and during a video tribute, illustrating through music and quotes what Dr. King stood for. Other contributors were also observed and honored by the committee for having a large impact directly on the South Florida community. 

Past guest speakers had been prominent leaders of the time, speaking on a variety of different issues surrounding the community as a whole. 

This year proved to be no different.  

Mfume is from Baltimore and who was raised in a troubled community,  forced to drop out of school after his mother passed away.  

He became a teenage parent, the father of five boys, and rose to be a well-known and respected voice for the black community.  

He has made an impact on local and national issues regarding diversity and has been a spokesperson for these issues through amending law and appearances on the radio and television.  

Nevertheless, work still needs to be done - and lots of it, because according to Mfume, "We have a problem."  

The climax of Mfume's speech used an unlikely movie quote from the film Armageddon to make his point.  

Mfume raised his voice in criticism of the condition of our society. 

"Brother, you're not a man because you can kill somebody," said Mfume.  "You're not a man because you can biologically make a baby - you're a man when you can take care of that baby."

Ron Thompson, a member of the MLK 2006 commemoration committee and assistant director of residential life reflected on Mfume's speech.

"No one could have better punctuated the 15th year of this celebration then Kweisi Mfume.  He was right, powerful and true and I only wish more people could have witnessed this," Thompson said.

His concern for society and sincerity at addressing the place of minorities was received with multiple standing ovations.  

Rhetorical thought provoking questions were asked of the audience and Mfume challenged all to do what they could to make a difference.

"This is an event that works every year. There is no day like this, which gives students and faculty a time to reflect upon opportunities they have to make a difference. I can only hope more students are able to attend each year and perhaps, we may even move it to a bigger venue," said Interim Provost Ronald Berkman.  

 "The is my fourth year," said Janae Jackson, one of the ushers at the event, a senior majoring in human resource management and president of Sisters in Spirit.  "It's the event of the year for FIU and I wouldn't miss it for the world. The speakers are absolutely phenomenal."

Headline: Senate looks for compromise
Subheadline: New committee to address faculty concerns
Author: C. Joel Marino / Content Editor
&nbsp;
Members of the Faculty Senate have decided to appoint a provisional committee following reports that a Dec. 13 meeting involved a censuring of University President Modesto A. Maidique that could lead to a vote of no confidence.

"The [Miami] Herald wrongly reported that we censured the president," said Bruce Hauptli, president of the Faculty Senate. "There was no censuring, we only formed a new committee to deal with some of the problems that were brought up at that meeting."

During this session, a special investigatory committee set up in 2004 to research if the president deserved a vote of no confidence presented its findings through a special report.

Although the report (written by three Faculty Senate members, Hauptli among them) praised the university's continual growth as "a testimony to President Maidique's administrative vision, leadership and use of limited financial resources," it also listed "a number of consistent concerns" related to this very growth.

Among the report's concerns were the "puzzling and troublesome" financial crisis FIU has been experiencing; the "immense risks" of undertaking the medical school initiative; and the sluggish contract negotiations between the faculty union and the administration.

"We listed both positives and negatives in these findings to present a balanced view of the administration," Hauptli said. "I thought the report was going to be the end of the matter, but I was clearly wrong."

According to Hauptli, the senate's Steering Committee did not agree on the moderate tone of the report and decided to make "a strongly worded motion" against the administration that may have been confused as a call to censure the president.

"Much of the concern and dissatisfaction the faculty expressed had been addressed sufficiently by the administration before," Hauptli said.

After the Steering Committee demanded the grievances in the report to be addressed, the Faculty Senate decided to appoint three professors to work with the president and acting provost in coming up with solutions for the complaints. 

This panel will be called the Collaboration Committee, making oral presentations each month before showing their final results sometime in March. 

The senate will decide to take action based on data from their report.

Although Maidique and Interim Provost Ronald Berkman could not be reached for immediate comments, Berkman briefly alluded to the formation of the committee in the Faculty Senate's Jan. 17 meeting, stating that he "looked forward to cooperating in anyway possible" as he assured that "the administration cares for these concerns and their resolution."

While the three-member committee focuses on finding administrative answers to faculty grievances, the senate will be working on the final steps of the contract renewal process, negotiations having finally been reached during the winter break between Berkman and union leader Alan Gummerson.

Headline: A path around apathy
Subheadline: a guide to getting to class even when it hurts
Author: Alicia Bustomante
&nbsp;
How to:

It's the mid-school-year hump and we're all dragging our feet to get back into the swing of things. With every passing year the holiday break seems to get shorter, with stress outweighing replenishing relaxation. You don't even have time to break the news to your mom that you failed finite math without already having to hit her up for money to take it again. 

Gladly, the new year signifies rebirth and forgiveness for past scholastic indiscretions. At FIU, a clean slate is handed to you in the form of a schedule with four to five ambiguous last names that hold your potential GPA hostage until the end of April. You and your peers fall under what's known as 'the first-week façade' - happily taking 40 minutes to find a parking space, shaking professors' hands, hunting for bookish-looking people to form study groups and promising yourself that this will be the semester you make the dean's list. 

Tragically though, the high doesn't last. Life's other demands mistake you for taffy and you get so overwhelmed with a thankless existence that you begin to say, "What's the point of any of this?" Apathy begins to rear its sloth-like head. 

This semester though, that response is unacceptable, especially after having so many withdrawals that your grades for last term look like the beginning of an internet address. Here's how to combat the apathy fog:


No class in class:

Some classes don't end up like what you think they will be. Titles of classes can be very misleading, which can be very distressing - for instance, the rude awakening one finds when he or she realizes "history of Greek life" doesn't give extra credit during rush week. 

You can try to get into another class but by the time you realize the original class isn't what you want, all other options are gone. Therefore, you have to make the most of it.

There are many ways to keep entertained in a regrettable class without being too rude or disruptive. For example, you can try to get the professor to tell an anecdote about the class topic (which hopefully is more interesting than the subject matter). You'll make a good impression because professors love talking about themselves. Why else would you pursue a profession where it's practically a one-man show? All that's missing is a ventriloquist dummy. 

Carrot in front of the horse:

Apathy sinks in most when you only look at the small scope and get caught in the drudgery of everyday life. Looking beyond your classes or even your major keeps you focused on the big picture. Keep reminders in your room of who you intend to be, like a giant flow chart that concludes "college = success" or pictures of people who motivate you. If you're into politics, post a giant picture of Dick Cheney to remind you of your goals. It can inspire or traumatize anyone to get out of bed and get to class.


Get out of jail free:

As romantic as it may sound to forge through the dullest of classes with perfect attendance, for many students the odds are greater to be ripped from a dorm room by a T-rex. With that said, when you do skip class, you should make your activity worth the average-dropping zero for the day and make sure those bookish types are taking good notes for you. 

Try to avoid commonplace activities like going to the beach or drinking yourself into a stupor and look for something really worthwhile to do. You don't have to limit yourself to one indulgence either. Keeping a full schedule of fun (facials, pedicures, money laundering) makes sure you release enough stress so you'll be less likely to skip in the future.

Then again, why kid ourselves? It's inevitable. Everyone succumbs to apathy sooner or later - for example, when trying to conclude a humor column for the student newspaper.      

The end.

Headline: Film makers to host festival for independant films, music
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Every artist, whatever their medium, waits for their proverbial 'big break' when their works of self-expression can finally be appreciated by larger audiences. For all those interested in having that medium be either film or music, an upcoming event may present an exciting opportunity to showcase their talent.

On Feb. 6, the Miami Independent Film and Music Festival will be accepting submissions from any filmmaker or band/DJ interested in entering the competition. Independent filmmakers Jose and Karim Fernandez, who are arranging the entire event, emphasize that when it comes to entries, what matters is not the budget but the story being told. One of the few guidelines is that all work submitted must be purely original. Film-makers can choose among four different categories in which to fit their entries (Feature Film, Short Film, Short Short Film and Animation) and musicians are asked to send at least three of their songs on CD.

Once the submission process is completed, the actual showdown is scheduled for July 28 at The Roxy theater across from University Park, where a formal dinner will be held for the finalists. 

Throughout July 29, two celebrity judge panels will watch the live 'battle of the bands' and view the finalists' films, selecting those they believe to have the most potential. 

Representatives will be present from such impressive film companies as Universal, Sony and Disney; and one of the prizes available to a very fortunate band will be a contract with a record company. Winners will be chosen and announced July 30. 

Jose and Karim, though not related, are partners in Fernandez Bros. Films and explain that the basis of this festival is one that has been building up forever. Their voices reveal they are obviously excited that their dream is finally materializing. 

Through much hard work, they have networked and made the calls necessary to ensure that this will be a successful event. 

Karim says he feels that they are "pulling this off by the skin of our teeth," but that they are doing it simply because it is what they love. 

"It's not about the money, but instead in a way it's about the glory," he said. 

Although the Fernandez 'brothers' have a comedy series of their own and have acquired a fan base through MySpace, they have decided to refrain from showing their own films during the event. 	

"It's not about us," Jose explains. "It's about giving everyone else a chance."

Jose and Karim hope that this can become an annual festival, but they need the help of FIU students to make their very first one a hit. Anyone interested in helping out or submitting an entry can e-mail them at miamiindie@yahoo.com and can also use this address to look up their MySpace page.

As you walk in, the mysterious sounds and evergreen surrounding sooth the body. The snakes, fish and water streams on display capture your attention. The scientific games make you feel like a kid again.

This and much more is part of the Amazon Voyage exhibit at the Miami Museum of Science and Planetarium.

World-renowned scientists from major universities (including FIU) and ecological organizations from North and South America have put together years of research in this 5,000 square foot interactive exhibition.

Philip Stoddard, professor for the Department of Biological Sciences, is glad to have some of his work on display.  

"It's opportunities like this that you can take things that you have generating in your expeditions and laboratories and bring it out to the public and make it part of the general knowledge," Stoddard said.

Stoddard's display titled "Electric Fish" focuses on the way knifefish generate low-voltage electricity and use their electric fields to navigate and communicate. He traveled to the Amazon many times researching this and worked on his findings at FIU.

"The electro fish recording came out of the lab at FIU and a number of things here are things we discovered at FIU," Stoddard said. "It's a nice opportunity to see basic research being put into the public ground from FIU. We have contributed to the knowledge of this exhibit."

Stoddard also co-wrote many of the descriptions on every exhibit and wrote them in a way to help people understand them.

"Being a teacher, you learn to explain things to people on many different levels," Stoddard said. "You work hard to make it interesting for adults and understandable by children."

The museum is set as various stops along the Amazon River. Through hands-on activities, original multimedia presentations, live fish in tanks from the Amazon, live demonstrations and much more, the exhibit has something for everyone. Work from artist Ray Troll is also featured across the entire museum.

Despite the various displays of the Amazon, a computer, nothing to do with the nature of Brazil, seemed to attract plenty of attention. Titled "Age Machine Wrinkles," the computer takes a photo of a person and is able to access a prediction of how they will look up to 25 years down the line. 

There is also a special walk along a bridge where there are several artifacts form Central and South America both authentic and replicated. One in particular, a big head titled "El Rey," is a full size replica of a Mexican Olmec monument standing nine feet tall of the original that dates 1100 BC. 

The exhibition will be in Miami for a limited time. It will soon travel to Washington D.C. for a presentation at the Smithsonian Institution. It then will begin a five-year tour of U.S. museums across the country.
