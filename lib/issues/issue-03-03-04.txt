Headline: Venezuelan forum triggers controversy
Author: Andrea Martini / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A guest panelist's controversial views turned an academic forum sponsored by the Venezuelan Student Association (VENESA) into a heated debate Friday.

Nearly 140 people attended the forum titled "Analysis of the current situation in Venezuela and its impact in the political, social and economic arena," which was held in MARC 245.

Members of the audience accused radio personality, and FIU alumnus Carlos Matamoros of being a communist and a "chavizta" after he questioned the Venezuelan media and expressed support for Chavez's new constitution.

"It is hard because the country's situation is changing by the hour and people are really sensitive at this time," Cristobal Lander, a 27-year-old FIU alumnus at the event, said.

VENESA sponsored the forum to inform the community about the overall effect, both internally and internationally, of the country's socio-political crisis.

 Joanna Garcia-Rubio, president of VENESA, said VENESA is a neutral organization, and that the forum was an academic event and not a political one. 

"We are very glad because we had a large audience and we were able to present information about all the different aspects - economic, political, military - of the conflict," Bertha Correa, VENESA advisor and director of public relations, said.

In addition to Matamoros, the forum also featured former Venezuelan Secretary of Defense Radames Munoz, former Member of Congress Raul Leoni, and advisor to the Cisneros Investing Group, Beatriz Rangel, as expert panelists.

Leopoldo Lopez, mayor of Chacao and prominent leader of the opposition movement in Venezuela, whose presence was scheduled as the highlight of the forum, did not attend the event because  an emergency situation was declared after bomb threats were directed against his municipality last week. However, forum coordinators were able to establish communication with him via telephone. 

Lopez spoke about the government's recent arrests of opposition leaders and labeled it as political persecution.

Munoz, Rangel and Leoni all criticized the tactics of the Venezuelan government and its head, President Hugo Chavez, but insisted that a democratic, electoral referendum was the appropriate solution to the problem.

Matamoros, who defended the legitimacy of the new 350-article constitution drafted by Chavez and questioned the neutrality and veracity of the Venezuelan media, stated on several occasions that he was not a "chavizta."

Some of the members of the audience reacted to this claim by laughing, and a few walked out.  

Matamoros was not surprised by this type of reaction. 

"I am used to this reaction because I am one of the few Venezuelans who has the courage to say these things," he said.

Matamoros also refuted the audience's claim that he was not qualified to speak about the issue because he left the country at 17. 

 "I am qualified because I am a journalist and I keep up with the current situation," he said.

Joseph Feo, a 56-year-old Kendall resident, thought the forum was not well organized.  

"What was meant to be a forum ended up being a debate," Feo said.  

But not everyone saw the event in a negative light.  

"A point of disagreement is always necessary to motivate a discussion, and Matamoros contributed to this," Munoz said.

When asked about the audience's negative reactions to Matamoros' comments, Lopez said that people need to understand both sides of the issue. 

"We must respect each other's opinions because this is important in order to preserve the dialogue," Lopez said.

Rumors circulated that Matamoros was a last-minute addition to the forum, and that he was only invited to fill in for the individuals who could not attend the event.

VENESA denied these claims.  

"We extended an invitation to Carlos Matamoros in the beginning because we wanted to be neutral and his views were different than the rest of the panelists," Correa said.

Headline: Blood banks in need
Subheadline: Drives will be held at FIU to help with shortage
Author: Geannina Munizaga / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Blood drives will be held at both campuses next week in order to help replenish much needed supplies for the nation.

"Now, more than ever, we need the help [of the FIU community]," Greta Mallon, who has been the director for donor recruitment at Community Blood Centers of South Florida for the past three and a half years, said. 

Blood drives will be held Mar. 11 - 12 at the University Park campus and Mar. 12 - 13 at the Biscayne Bay campus. After that, they will held on both campuses every month.

"In South Florida alone, blood banks need to collect more than 600 pints per day to fulfill the needs of our hospitals," Mallon said.

According to Dr. Robert Dollinger, executive director of FIU's University Health Services, blood shortages have reached a dire state.

"We're always in need," Dollinger said. "We're in critical shortages. All blood types - A, B and O positive - are needed."

According to Dollinger, the looming war is making blood supplies even more scarce. In addition to the rest of the nation's regular needs, American troops also need to have blood supplies readily available. 

"We're doing special blood drives specifically for the war because we're experiencing shortages," Dollinger said.

 Because of the nation's military reliance on U.S. blood centers, they are collecting donations throughout the United States in anticipation of a greater need during wartime. 

"We want to do as much as we can," Dollinger said, "because one main function [of UHS] is to help out the community."

Up to three lives can be saved each time someone donates blood, Dollinger said.

Trained phlebotomists, specialists who draw blood from patients or donors for analysis or other medical purposes, perform the procedure inside the bloodmobiles. The procedure includes a small series of medical history questions and a mini-physical - where your iron, blood pressure, temperature and pulse are checked.  Then the donating begins which, after the initial pinch, takes about five to eight minutes.

It's not only the blood banks that are helping out the cause. 

"Fraternities, sororities and [FIU] athletes in particular are very receptive to helping the cause," Dollinger said.

"I try donating whenever I can," sophomore Sarah Lozoff said. "I wish I could do more, but you have to wait two months in between donations."

According to Mallon, FIU ranks high on the list of schools in South Florida who contribute significant amounts of blood. Organizers of the blood drives feel students are ready, willing and able to donate blood.

"We get a lot of blood from FIU," said Carlos Jaramillo and Raul Justiniano, recruiters for Community Blood Centers of South Florida. "Of course, we get a larger amount from the University Park campus because the student body is larger, but many [FIU students] donate and donate often."

"Students are sensitive to the importance of donating, especially in devastating times," Dollinger said.

"After 9-11 there were huge lines [of students]," Dollinger said. "There weren't enough bloodmobiles to go around. It was totally incredible."

The requirements for donating blood are few. In order to be eligible to donate you must be at least 17 years old, weigh no less than 100 pounds, be in good health and wait at least eight weeks since your last donation. 

Though the requirements for donating are few, certain circumstances can prevent you from donating.

These include if you've had hepatitis at or after the age of 11, received a blood transfusion during the last year, are pregnant or have been within the last six weeks, had a tattoo within the past year or are practicing risky sexual behavior.

"Many people, students in particular, don't know how simple the requirements are," Mallon said. "The most important issue of all is education."

After the donation, the blood goes through a long process, undergoing many tests. These include tests for blood type, cholesterol and diseases such as hepatitis, HIV and syphilis. You can contact the center to find out your results.

"We need volunteers to go forth and help their community," Mallon said. "Donating doesn't really affect you physically. Blood plasma is replaced within 24 hours, and red cells need about four to eight weeks for complete replacement."

Despite sterile instruments, gifts, free food and the opportunity to save a life, some students won't give blood because they are afraid. 

"I'm terrified of needles," Mike Sequeiros, a political science major, said. "I don't think the nurses would be able to hold me down. I would be kicking and screaming once that [needle] came near me."

Senior Steven Burgos cringes at the thought of donating.

"I know I might sound ridiculous, but my stomach gets weak when someone even speaks of needles," he said.

Headline: Holocaust seminar focuses on women
Author: Jennifer Sittig / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A "Women and the Holocaust" symposium will be held on Mar. 9 from 3 - 6 p.m. at the Kovens Conference Center at the Biscayne Bay Campus.  

"Women and the Holocaust" is the last in a series of three seminars about Jewish women and their impact and contributions to humanity. "Women in Sephardic Culture" and "American Jewish Women" were the themes of the first two symposiums.

Each symposium's purpose is "to raise the level of intellectual discussion in the greater Miami area," Oren Baruch Stier, assistant professor of Religious Studies, associate director of the Judaic Studies Program at FIU and moderator of the symposium, said.

The Institute for Judaic and Near Eastern Studies, the Department of Religious Studies, the Women's Studies Center and The Holocaust Memorial will be sponsoring "Women in the Holocaust."

Avi Mizrachi, The Holocaust Memorial executive director, said their goal as a sponsor is to "work together with universities to promote issues related to academia and to education."  

Sara Horowitz and Bonnie Gurewitsch, will be speaking about women's experiences during the holocaust and how they differ from those of their male counterparts, as well as what impact Gender Studies has had on the ways humankind understands and observes the events of World War II.  

Horowitz, a professor at York University in Toronto and associate director of its Center for Jewish Studies, will be curating on the topic "The gender of good and evil: women and holocaust memory." The focus will be on women and their memory of the holocaust based on her ongoing research on gender and the Holocaust.  

Bonnie Gurewitsch, the archivist for the Jewish Heritage in New York City, will be curating on the topic "Camp sisters: a ray of hope in the concentration camp," which will focus on the concentration camp experiences of Jewish women.  In her lecture, she will draw from her own work of more than 25 years as a holocaust historian.

"We are very excited to host these speakers for this important event," Stier said.  "Bonnie and Sara are the leading experts on this little-explored but critical area of scholarship and remembrance."

Stier said the symposium will benefit both students and the public.

It will "draw attention to an under-examined area of scholarship on the holocaust, highlighting women's unique experiences and the significance of gender as a lens onto the memorial and historiographic issues facing those who study and remember the holocaust," he said.

FIU has hosted numerous Judaic Studies events, but this is the first time "Women and the Holocaust" will be held. The event is free to the public  and Stier hopes there will be "a packed house." 

He said that The Institute of Judaic and Near Eastern Studies wants "to foster intellectual discussion and enhance the student learning experience through events like this one."

Headline: Last minute spring break cruises, flights still available to students
Author: Marjorie Rizzo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Spring break is only two weeks away, and the clock is ticking to take advantage of remaining deals. 

FIU's spring break is Mar. 17 - 21, and according to Sharon Conception, a travel agent at Travel Leaders, FIU's travel provider at the University Park campus, students have been booking spring break vacations for months in advance. 

"Kids have been coming in since last November and October for spring break vacation arrangements,"  Conception said, "and business has never slowed down."

"People are still dropping by asking about any remaining deals and offers," Conception said. 

The most popular spots during spring break are Cancun, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, with Puerto Rico being the most expensive of the three, according to Conception.

 And if cruises are your thing, Conception recommends Carnival Cruise Line.

 "Carnival is the most fun for students 21 and over; it's a fun ship and young people like it," she said.

The cost for a Carnival Cruise Line three-day round trip from Miami to somewhere like the Bahamas can range upwards of $229 per person, depending on the availability of the cruise when travel arrangements are made.

According to Ester Lozanal, a guest vacation specialist at Royal Caribbean International Cruise Vacations, cruises are popular among college students, and a three-night round trip from Miami to the Bahamas may range from $257 per person, depending on availability.

Cruises aren't the only option for spring break trips.

Claire Samaniego, Fontainebleau Travel manager, said that although cruises are popular among college students, flying to fun destinations is also a way to go. She recommends paying attention to timing and prices to seize the best deals.
"Booking flights early is important, but perhaps more important, is keeping your eyes open for bargains," Samaniego said.

She offered some traveling tips for students.

"Students should know about all inclusive packages that include air fare, hotel-stay, all meals, gratuity and entertainment, because not only are they usually at a good price, but it means students don't have to worry about carrying a lot of money with them," Samaniego said.

Fontainebleau Travel currently offers some all-inclusive packages that fly to popular spring break locations.  

It offers a package for Puerto Plata in Puerto Rico for $559 per person and one for Cozumel, Mexico, which is a three-night package for $484 a person. 

There is also a two-night package to the Bahamas that includes everything except meals, for $409 per person. 

No matter where students are going during spring break, Samaniego recommends that they keep their passport with them.

"Young people should always make sure they have their passport at all times," Samaniego said, "and make sure they leave copies at home with their parents or friends, so that in case of an emergency they can be faxed copies of their passport."

Freshman Lisa Toy has already made plans to go to Los Angeles, Calif. for spring break and she said she is not worried about any emergencies that may arise relating to Homeland Security. 

"I am planning on having fun during my break, and I am not planning on worrying about any orange or yellow codes of alert," Toy said. 


"I booked my flight to Los Angeles since last month, on Cheaptickets.com and it cost me about $400 for the plane ticket," Toy said. "I am going with two friends and we're staying with my cousin, so I'll have to take spending money, but not too much because I am planning on mooching off family." 

Senior Fadia Ferrer has not yet made any official plans for spring break, but she has an idea of what she would like to do.


She said her budget for the trip will be $1,500, and she would like to spend her break somewhere in the Caribbean where they have the best beaches. 


Ferrer adds she is not worried that she won't find any remaining deals. 

"You can always find something, no matter how late it is," she said.

Disability Services grateful for council's help

Kathryn Trionfo, BBC Disability Services associate director, took cake and soda to the meeting as a "token of appreciation" for the council's assistance in getting a larger room for the disabled at the BBC library.

The previous room, on the third floor of the library, was smaller and there were complaints of inadequate air conditioning and ventilation.

"This room is a wonderful, big room, with enough space for people in wheel chairs to be able to turn around," she said. "The old room didn't even have air vents - and we like having air conditioning." 

Disabled individuals can access the room, LIB 122, by borrowing the key from the circulation desk on the first floor of the library.



Funding approved for organization's trip

The council approved an appropriation of $710 to cover the cost of The West Indian Students' Association's trip to Tampa from Mar. 28 - 30.

The funds will cover the cost of a rental van and two hotel rooms at the Embassy Suites in Tampa.

The resolution states, "The West Indian Students' Association provides a medium for students of West Indian descent and mind to network and communicate through a statewide cooperation, to ensure that their voices are heard in their home away from home, Florida."

Finance Chair Nicaise Parillon, Representative at Large Admatha Israel and Lower Division Representative Micah Mintz sponsored the resolution.

The appropriation was approved by a vote of five in favor, none against and one abstention.

Headline: Crímenes de mujeres: una investigación plagada de negligencia
Subheadline: Jorge Humberto Chávez 
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;

La noche del 9 de noviembre de 2001, agentes judiciales sometieron a una brutal tortura a Víctor Javier García Uribe y Gustavo González Meza. Fotografías y exámenes médicos revelan que los golpearon, les apagaron cigarros en el estómago y aplicaron descargas eléctricas en los genitales. Y así fue como la policía supuestamente resolvió el asesinato de ocho jovencitas y convirtió a García Uribe, alias El Cerillo, y a González Meza, alias La Foca, en los últimos homicidas seriales de Ciudad Juárez, en el norte de México. Desde su celda, los dos acusados aseguraron que preferían morir torturados antes que volver a confesar los ocho asesinatos que dicen no haber cometido ("La foca" murió recientemente; más detalles en el artículo "Una muerte controversial").

La realidad es que no hay ninguna evidencia que demuestre la culpabilidad de La Foca y El Cerillo, y la Procuraduría General de Justicia del Estado (PGJE), encargada de buscar la verdad y la justicia, ha hecho todo menos eso. Y en su afán por mantener su supuesta investigación, funcionarios de todos los niveles, desde agentes judiciales hasta el procurador del estado, participaron en el secuestro, tortura, fabricación de pruebas y testigos, ocultaron dictámenes, violaron la ley y recurrieron a los medios en vez de los tribunales, para demostrar ante la opinión pública la culpabilidad de los dos acusados. 

En el expediente de los ocho asesinatos no hay una sola prueba pericial que demuestre o vincule a los acusados con los crímenes. La único testigo del caso ya se retractó, la tortura está documentada, y la confesión, tan llena de detalles como de inconsistencias, se contradice con las pruebas de la misma PGJE y la defensa.

Pero lo más importante: según exámenes de ADN, cinco cuerpos encontrados entre el 6 y 7 de noviembre en un campo algodonero no pertenecen a las mujeres que los choferes y la procuraduría identificaron.

Y mientras tanto, ocho familias viven desde hace un año con la angustia de la incertidumbre por saber si los cadáveres encontrados en noviembre pertenecen a sus hijas: Guadalupe Luna de la Rosa, estudiante universitaria de 20 años; Verónica Martínez Hernández, de 19 años, trabajadora de una maquiladora; Bárbara Aracely Martínez Ramos, de 20 años;  María de los Angeles Acosta Ramírez, estudiante, de 19 años;  Mayra Juliana Reyes Solís, de 17 años; Laura Berenice Ramos Monárrez, de 17 años, estudiante; Claudia Ivette González, de 20 años, trabajadora de maquiladora; y Brenda Esmeralda Herrera Monrreal, estudiante y trabajadora de 15 años.

Quiénes son las víctimas

Cecilia de la Rosa contiene las lágrimas y se aferra a que su hija Guadalupe Luna de la Rosa sigue viva. Poco importa que tenga más de dos años desaparecida y dos hombres estén acusados de su asesinato.

&#8220;Por qué me voy a exponer a un dolor que no es el mío&#8221;, reclama Cecilia, quien exige una sola prueba de que dicho cadáver es su hija.

Un estudio de ADN realizado por la Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) a los ocho cadáveres, a petición de la PGJE, reveló que ninguna de las ocho osamentas pertenece a Guadalupe o Lupita, como la llaman sus familiares y amigos.

Todos los exámenes periciales que se hicieron al cuerpo que supuestamente pertenece a Lupita también dieron negativos, pero la PGJE insiste en que ella fue víctima de La Foca y El Cerillo. 

&#8220;Lupita no esta ahí. Hay estudios preliminares que te dicen el tamaño de los huesitos, craneometría, dientes, y no esta ahí&#8221;, dice Oscar Maynes, ex jefe de peritos de la PGJE en Ciudad Juárez. 

Pero desde el día que aparecieron los cuerpos se especuló sobre su identidad. A Cecilia de la Rosa le dijeron en un principio que no había evidencia o ropa que indicara que su hija estaba entre los cadáveres, pero el 11 de noviembre, el entonces procurador de justicia, Arturo González Rascón, reveló la supuesta identidad de las ocho osamentas y afirmó que Lupita era una de ellas.

Otros cuatro cuerpos tampoco corresponden a las víctimas.

La perito en genética forense de la PGR, Xóchitl Adriana Félix López, envió los resultados de los exámenes de ADN el 20 de septiembre y el 8 de octubre del 2002 al subprocurador de la PGJE, Elfego Bencomo López. Los exámenes consistieron en comparar el perfil genético de las ocho osamentas con el de las ocho familias que reportaron a sus hijas desaparecidas.

Los resultados destruyen los argumentos de la PGJE y contradicen las confesiones de los sospechosos: 

La primera joven asesinada, Guadalupe, quien desapareció el sábado 30 de septiembre del 2000, no estaba entre los cadáveres.

La segunda, Verónica Martínez, secuestrada el 19 de octubre del 2000, sí estaba entre los cadáveres: es la osamenta marcada como 191/01 y su cuerpo fue el primero de los descubiertos el miércoles siete de noviembre. Pero a pesar de que tenía 13 meses desaparecida, un análisis forense determinó que tenía entre seis a ocho meses de muerta. Esta contradicción muestra que la víctima pudo estar secuestrada por varios meses. Maynes asegura que en varios de los asesinatos contra mujeres existen indicios de que las víctimas fueron secuestradas por varios días. 

El reporte continúa indicando que Bárbara Aracely Martínez Ramos; la tercer mujer asesinada; María de los Angeles Acosta, la cuarta; y Mayra Juliana Reyes Solís, la quinta, no están entre los ocho cadáveres.

Los resultados de ADN revelaron que las autoridades entregaron el cuerpo equivocado a la familia de Laura Berenice Ramos Monárrez. La familia cremó los restos identificados en el expediente como osamenta 190/01, creyendo que era su hija, tras identificar la ropa que portaba el cadáver, lo que indica que el asesino cambió la vestimenta de sus víctimas. Maynes asegura que no es la primera vez que encuentran mujeres asesinadas con ropa de otras personas.

Las muestras genéticas de Claudia Ivette González no arrojaron información alguna debido a que factores ambientales dañaron el material genético. Sin embargo, su cuerpo fue identificado por medio de exámenes de craneometría y odontología, pues su quijada era muy afilada y estaba más marcada de lo usual. Brenda Esmeralda Herrera Monreal también fue identificada fácilmente, pues tenía apenas ocho días de muerta y su examen de ADN sí coincidió.

Los errores en la identificación de los cuerpos ha indignado a las familias de las jóvenes, quienes vivieron por un año bajo la impresión de que sus hijas estaban muertas, pero sin la certeza de tener un cadáver para sepultar. &#8220;Se contradicen unos a otros. Por qué me dicen que no está, luego que sí, por qué surgen dudas. Si no está, va a ser una año perdido, un año en el que ya no la buscaron&#8221;, dice la madre de Lupita. 

Desde el sábado 26 de octubre, Angela Talavera Lozoya, titular de la Fiscalía Especial para la Investigación de Homicidios de Mujeres, encargada de investigar los crímenes contra mujeres en Ciudad Juárez, ha caído en una serie de contradicciones cada vez más inverosímiles que demuestran como la PGJE está más preocupada por resanar sus errores que encontrar la verdad y hacer cumplir la justicia. 

Los funcionarios de la PGJE ocultaron los resultados de los exámenes desde el 20 de septiembre, incluso ante la Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos de la Organización de Estados Americanos, donde compareció el 18 de octubre el actual procurador Jesús Solís Silva y la fiscal especial Angela Talavera, para explicar los avances en la investigación de los asesinatos. Fue el diputado David Rodríguez, integrante de una comisión legislativa encargada de investigar los crímenes en Juárez, quien reveló los estudios de la PGR, provocando el reclamo de las autoridades estatales, quienes alegaron que la PGR no tenía justificación alguna para divulgar el estudio genético.

El lunes 28 de octubre la fiscal Talavera minimizó los resultados de ADN y los calificó de incompletos. Alegó a los medios que los exámenes no eran &#8220;nada nuevo&#8221; y que correspondían a un avance preliminar dado a conocer 6 meses atrás, ignorando que el primer dictamen estaba fechado el 20 de septiembre y el segundo el 8 de octubre. 

Las justificaciones continuaron el martes 29 de octubre, cuando Talavera y el subprocurador Bencomo reconocieron que la dependencia había recibido los resultados, pero la fiscal argumentó que &#8220;el doctor Alejandro Santos Rubio, jefe del Departamento de Servicios Periciales, recibió el dictamen desde el 8 de octubre y apenas este martes me avisó&#8221;. Esto a pesar de que ambos estudios están dirigidos a Bencomo.

La declaración más inverosímil para restarle credibilidad a los exámenes de ADN la emitió el subprocurador Bencomo, quien explicó a los medios que por lo general las pruebas genéticas que se hacen con huesos resultan negativas. 

&#8220;Eso es totalmente falso. El ADN en los huesos no resulta negativo&#8221;, explica el Dr. Paul Goldstein, especialista en investigación genética de la Universidad de Texas en El Paso (UTEP). &#8220;El ADN se encuentra en cualquier célula, y los huesos están hechos de células y además es muy fácil obtener buenas muestras de ADN de la médula ósea&#8221;, afirma Goldstein. 

Después Talavera afirmó que la PGJE no se conformaría con los resultados de ADN y restó validez a los estudios que la misma dependencia solicitó, calificándolos de preliminares e incluso, de no concluyentes, aduciendo el avanzado estado de descomposición de los cuerpos, y se aferró a las identidades establecidas basadas en estudios antropométricos, craneométricos y odontológicos. 

Para el Dr. Pablo Arenaz, especialista en ADN y subdirector del departamento de ciencias de UTEP, es falso que se pueda basar la identidad de una persona con exámenes craneométricos u odontológico cuando el ADN da negativo. &#8220;El ADN es la prueba absoluta e inconfundible para establecer la identidad de alguien. Se puede lograr una certeza superior al 99 por ciento&#8221;, dice Arenaz. El doctor Goldstein lo respalda: &#8220;No hay nada más confiable que el ADN para establecer la identidad de un individuo&#8221;.

Y Maynes, en ese entonces jefe del departamento que realizó los primeros estudios para identificar a los cuerpos, confirma que los análisis craneométricos y antropométricos resultaron negativos, el tamaño de los huesos no correspondía con las medidas de las víctimas y el tiempo de muerte de los cuerpos no coincidía con las fechas de desaparición, por eso se recurrió a los exámenes de ADN.

Además el actuar de los agentes de la PGJE se contradice incluso con afirmaciones de la dependencia. Manuel Esparza Navarrete, coordinador de Ministerios Públicos adscritos a la fiscalía especial, asegura que &#8220;para poder iniciar una investigación nosotros necesitamos conocer a la víctima, si no conocemos a la víctima, no podemos trabajar&#8221;. Y en este caso hubo detenidos confesos antes de identificar a las víctimas.

Pero el hecho de que cinco de los cuerpos no correspondan a las mujeres que los choferes dijeron asesinar, le resta credibilidad a una confesión que se percibe, según varias fuentes, un guión prefabricado por la misma judicial.

¿Y entonces, a quiénes mataron?

Los exámenes de ADN revelaron una falla importante en la investigación: hay dos indiciados de matar a ocho mujeres identificadas, pero que los cuerpos no corresponden. Es decir, son acusados de matar a víctimas que no son.

Y las contradicciones de la PGJE aumentan. Cuando era evidente que la opinión pública no creía en los argumentos para restar credibilidad a los exámenes de ADN,  la fiscal Talavera descartó que la identificación negativa de los cuerpos ayude a la defensa de La Foca y El Cerillo, pues aseguró que ellos están acusados de la muerte de las tres mujeres identificadas y de otros &#8220;cinco cuerpos sin fijarles el nombre&#8221;. Después, el 30 de octubre, declaró que &#8220;están acusados del homicidio de ocho cuerpos, los cuales no tienen marcados los nombres de cada uno de ellos&#8221;.

Pero un oficio del Ministerio Público, encargado de solicitar el procesamiento al juez tercero de lo penal, José Alberto Vázquez Quintero, desmiente a la fiscal Talavera, pues solicita &#8220;acción penal persecutoria en contra de Víctor Javier García Uribe (a) &#8220;El Cerillo&#8221; y Gustavo González Meza (a) &#8220;El Gordo&#8221; y/o &#8220;El Foca&#8221; como presuntos responsables de los delitos de violación, homicidio y asociación delictuosa, cometidos los dos primeros delitos en perjuicio de Guadalupe Luna de la Rosa, Verónica Martínez Hernández, Bárbara Aracely Martínez Ramos, María de los Angeles Acosta Ramírez, Mayra Juliana Reyes Solís, Laura Berenice Ramos Monárrez, Claudia Ivette González y Esmeralda Herrera Monrreal&#8221;. El auto de formal prisión firmado por el juez Vázquez Quintero también enumera a las ocho víctimas y los días en que fueron secuestradas y asesinadas.

Los exámenes de ADN también contradicen a la misma confesión de los choferes, pues ellos identificaron las fotos de las ocho víctimas y dieron una descripción detallada de su físico y la ropa que vestían.

Finalmente la PGJE reconoció que no pudo probar científicamente la identidad de las ocho víctimas ante el nuevo magistrado que lleva el caso, Javier Pineda Arzala, juez séptimo de lo penal, y pidió cambiar la acusación, ahora por la muerte y violación de ocho cuerpos sin identificar.

Sergio Dante Almaraz, abogado de los acusados, denunció la maniobra de la PGJE como una más de las irregularidades del proceso. El abogado Eduardo Mariscal, quien tiene litigando 20 años, asegura que la acusación &#8220;se le va a caer&#8221; a la PGJE, pues &#8220;ya los acusaron de matar a personas plenamente identificadas, y si esas personas no son, no hay cuerpo del delito y estas personas (los acusados) tienen que salir&#8221;.

&#8220;Eso es absurdo&#8221;, también dice Maynes. &#8220;Aquí ya estamos en una situación kafkiana completamente. Hay una hipótesis oficial y lo que no va ajustando, lo van cambiando a su voluntad porque tienen controlado periciales, los jueces, los ministerios públicos&#8221;. 

Para Marisela Ortiz, de la organización Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa, las acciones de la PGJE sólo han traído más dolor y confusión a las familias de las mujeres desaparecidas. 

A Maynes le preocupa otro detalle vital: si los cuerpos no corresponden a cinco de las víctimas, quiénes son entonces las otras mujeres asesinadas y dónde están Guadalupe de la Rosa, Laura Berenice, Mayra Juliana, María de los Angeles y Bárbara Aracely.

I guess you want a newspaper that more reflects the student body. I have already talked to several members on staff at the Beacon and they are staunchly liberal. This newspaper is one of the most intolerant student papers that I have ever seen in my life. Not only do you slant your news toward the left, but also you flood the opinion section with liberal rhetoric. Then you print my little teeny tiny article in the form of a "letter to the editor" and titled the opinion article as an attack ad against me. More students read the rebuttle article against me then the original article it was rebutting because you decided to title it: Mallo article ignorant. You could have at least sent me an email saying that you weren't going to print my article. If you had printed my teeny tiny article next to the Bush-bashing one that took an entire page you would have been a little more balanced. I am very digusted with this newspaper and vow never to read it again until you make a formal apology for not printing both sides. Shame on you!!

Headline: Subject : Guest Article: Where is the Logic?
Subheadline:  
Author: thedrdrew@netzero.com
&nbsp;
I am not totally convinced that Alqaedawhateveritscalled and Saddam Hussein collaborated to attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. That is not the point. It should have never been suggested as the reason for war against Iraq anyway. I will return to this point later.
 
First of all the cynicism that some of these anti-Americans (they are not truly anti-war--they are anti-American) have for the Bush administration--that they do not trust Colin Powell's report that Iraq harbors and aids alquedawhateveritscalled henchmen further reveals their true intentions. What you must accept is that they trust Saddam Hussein--a man who has been lying to the world for over 12 years. Just recently inspectors found missiles that Hussein did not disclose in the weapons declaration required by the UN. The anti-war crowd has a credibility problem and has a difficulty with logic. First of all the call for proof is ridiculous. Clearly they disregard the recent evidence of undeclared weapons. That is the most recent overt evidence. Twelve years of deception and the fact that we have passed seventeen resolutions all demanding he comply with past resolutions to disarm is further evidence. What more is the anti-America crowd requesting-- More resolutions and more time for Saddam to disarm? Where is the logic? Twelve years is not long enough for Saddam to do what nations like South Africa did in much less time? You have anti-American nations like France and Germany asking the same thing: More time to disarm. Saddam has no willingness to do so. As I covered in a letter to the editor, France and Germany show more interest in profit than they do for the very freedom Americans have paid with their own lives for France and Germany.
 
This leads back to the first point. The war on Iraq is not about retaliating against them for alleged ties to the September 11th attacks. This is a war on terror- and Iraq is a terrorist state that is not worthy of weapons of mass destruction. They utilize weapons of mass destruction to murder neighbors and people residing in Iraq who dare to oppose the regime. Weapons of mass destruction are tools for peace--not tools for terror. Therefore it does not matter of Hussein was involved in 9/11 or not. A war against terror is to wipe out terrorism so that future generations do not have to live with terror levels everyday like we do today. The failure of the UN to protect and defend peace has proven that it is inept to deal with serious issues. Once again America is called to deal with the threat against peace--and history will look upon nations like France and Germany and the anti-American citizens of this nation with extreme shame and embarrassment. 
 
The anti-war crowd in the United States has a problem with thinking globally. This is part of liberal thinking. Liberals fail to look at the future and are only interested in what is happening now. Their drive is wholly centered on fear alone. They are so afraid that they are numb from the neck up. Every argument they make stems from emotions like fear. They fear that if we act more terrorism will occur. But where is the logic? Freedom does not inherently exist. It exists because people are willing to fight and die for it--not because we talk about it or because of the fear that we might make someone angry. 

Where are the organized marches against Saddam Hussein in Baghdad? As I stated before in a previous letter to the editor, these people are weasles and panzies who are allowed to protest against their country because the military ensures and protects freedom.

G-d bless George W. Bush--and G-d bless the United States of America!!!

Author: jarhead982003@yahoo.com
&nbsp;
For those not familiar with the word Heterosexual this simply means if you're a man you're attracted to women and if you're a woman you're attracted to men! Do you hide your status and date the HIV-? You risk being sent to prison for several years for a felony if you don't warn your potential sex partners! Now why risk this! There is a much easier solution! Just date exclusively those like yourself who are also HIV+! There is a simple way to find those like yourself on the internet at http://www.livingpositive.com you don't need a computer to go on line! Any public library has computers that anyone can use for free and log onto the internet and create a email address at yahoo.com or hotmail.com which are free email services, then log onto livingpositive.com and email those there in the ads or place a free ad yourself, none of this costs anything it is all free! If one believes the government's statistics there are about 1 million HIV+ people in the USA today and that is only the ones who know they are, this does not include the ones who don't know their status for fear of getting tested! So these numbers are no doubt much higher! If you own a computer or have a friend who owns one you can also go on line this way but as stated "library computers" are free to use to the public...! There are treatments now for HIV that may not cure it but do keep it under control and extend one's life significantly....! Don't be a fool and hide your status and date someone and expose them knowingly since this is a felony and is punishable by several years in prison...! There is a solution simply date others with HIV+ status and avoid the fear of rejection and exposure of your status!

Headline: Women's basketball rolls over UALR
Subheadline: Shafer becomes 16th Golden Panther to score 1,000 points
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It was a record-setting night for the Golden Panthers and Mandy Shafer.
Behind a game-high 27 points from the senior guard, FIU (18-9, 9-5 Sun Belt) easily defeated Sun Belt Conference rival Arkansas Little-Rock 96-44 on Saturday night at Golden Panther Arena. 

Shafer became the 16th Golden Panther  to surpass the 1,000 career point mark with her performance.  The Eustis, FL native also connected on five three-pointers giving her 60 for the year-a new FIU record. 

Additionally, Shafer stole the ball six times for another career best.

"It's a nice way to leave," said Shafer, who is currently 15th all-time in scoring at FIU with 1,004 points.  "It couldn't have come on a better night.  It was pretty special to accomplish this in our gym and in front of my family."

The game was also the final home contest for four FIU seniors all of which reached double figures.  Shafer, Cormisha Cotton, Anita Heller and Silvia Mesa each competed in their final home game of their collegiate careers.

The 52-point margin of victory was the largest for FIU in a conference matchup since joining the Sun Belt in the 1998-99 season.  

Defensively, FIU recorded season-high's with 12 blocked shots and 15 steals while also protecting the ball offensively knotting a season-low seven turnovers.

Heller scored a career-high 21 points and Cotton blocked six shots to tie her career-high and FIU's single-game record.

The Golden Panthers  connected on eight of their first 12 shots. UALR (5-22, 0-14) hung tough with FIU  in the early going. The teams were tied at 16 with 7:10 left in the first half before the Golden Panthers went on a 31-7 run to close out the half.

Mesa scored 10 points while Cotton added 12 and a game-high 10 rebounds for the 23rd double-double in her career.

UALR was led by Eplunus Brooks' 15 points and nine rebounds.

Next up FIU will be defending their Sun Belt Conference crown from a year ago at the Aeropostale Sun Belt Conference Tournament, March 6-11, in Bowling Green, Ky.  

FIU will face the sixth-seeded Ragin' Cajuns of Louisiana-Lafayette (8-18, 4-11 SBC) in the play-in round on Thursday at 9:00 p.m. EST. 

The Golden Panthers will be the third seed in the bracket.

Last season, FIU won the conference tournament and advanced to the NCAA field of 64. The Golden Panthers defeated Creighton 73-58 before falling to Penn State 96-79 at State College, PN.

FIU was on a thirteen-game winning streak and had not lost a contest in nearly two months before losing to the Nittany Lions.The Golden Panthers closed out the season at 27-6, 13-1 in the SBC.

&nbsp;
FIU hosted the Coca-Cola Golden Panther Invitational over the weekend. 
FIU opened the tournament with split of its two games played. The Golden Panthers won for a third-straight time with a 5-1 victory over Furman, then fell to Tennessee, 3-2.

Buffalo and Tennessee took the co-championship with victories Sunday at University Park.

FIU 5, Furman 1

After Furman grabbed an early 1-0 advantage against FIU winning pitcher Kendra Laminack (2-5), the Golden Panthers took the lead with tworuns in the top of the third inning.

Stephanie Wolter doubled home Meagan Dontrich with one out. Wolter later scored from second on a wild pitch.

FIU added three additional runs in the fifth on RBI singles by Jennifer Owens and Jennifer Powell and a run-scoring triple by Marleah Stapf.

Laminack lasted six innings  allowing two singles and a walk. She also recorded seven strikeouts. Nicole Barrett pitched a scoreless seventh inning in relief.

Headline: Baseball falls to FAU; knocks off FAMU 7-1
Author: Steve Perhla/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers hit the road this week, taking on two fellow state ballclubs, Florida Atlantic University and Florida A&M University. The Wednesday loss to the Owls marked the third straight defeat of the season for FIU, but the Golden Panthers got back on track Friday against the Rattlers, improving their record to 13-4.

FAU 13, FIU 7

FIU junior Josh Banks pitched a scoreless first inning, extending his team record to 30 consecutive scoreless innings, but got tagged for eight runs after that, as the Golden Panthers lost to FAU 13-7 in Boca Raton. 
Banks, who shut out the Rattlers twice earlier in the season, got into trouble early this time, leading to a high-scoring slugfest between the two clubs.

FIU got on the board first when shortstop Luis Rivera singled home right fielder Solomon Frieder, who had reached base with a double to the right-center field gap. A Fernando Alvarez sacrifice fly scored Skip Adams, giving the Panthers an early 2-0 lead.

Nursing the lead in the bottom of the second, Banks surrendered his first runs of the season when FAU outfielder Matt Pali hit a two-run homer to right-center field.

An inning later, FAU right fielder Jeff Fiorentino got to Banks again, homering down the right field line with two outs, giving the Owls a 3-2 lead.

FIU responded in the fourth. James Bacon, pinch hitting for Alvarez, drew a two out walk. Catcher Michael New and second baseman Dennis Diaz followed with back-to-back RBI doubles, giving FIU a 4-3 lead.

The Golden Panthers continued to build the lead in the sixth. Adams led off the inning with a walk. Rivera then singled to right. After recording the next two outs, FAU starter Chris Pillsbury allowed a two-out walk to Diaz. With the bases loaded, first baseman Michael Lopez drilled a Pillsbury pitch to deep left-center for a double, scoring all three Golden Panther baserunners, and increasing the FIU lead to 7-3.

But things went downhill from that point. In the bottom of the sixth, Fiorentino homered off Banks again, this time a two-run shot and his second of the game, narrowing the margin to 7-5. Three batters later, FAU first baseman Rusty Brown doubled off Banks, knocking in two more runs, tying the game at seven.

Senior Derek Taylor was called upon to replace Banks with a runner aboard. But the first batter he faced, second baseman Derek Hutton, singled home the go-ahead run, reclaiming the lead for FAU, 8-7. After an RBI groundout and another run on a throwing error by Taylor, FAU jumped out to a 10-7 lead with three innings to go.

But things got worse for FIU in the seventh. Freshman Ammer Cabrera replaced Taylor, and allowed four consecutive walks, giving the Owls an 11-7 advantage. Freshman Frank Gonzalez then entered the contest for FIU with the bases juiced, giving up only an RBI groundout to Pali, and escaping the inning down 12-7. The Owls tacked on one more insurance run in the eighth to increase the score to 13-7.

But the Golden Panthers couldn't get the bats going after that. FAU pitchers James Callahan and Chris Saxton combined to cool down the Golden Panther offense in the last two innings to preserve the win for Pillsbury and the Owls (10-4).

Banks (2-1) suffered his first loss of the season for FIU. 

The Golden Panthers will get a chance for redemption Wednesday, March 5, when the Owls visit FIU at University Park Stadium.

FIU leads the season series between the two sides 2-1.


FIU 7, FAMU 1

FIU, led by sophomore ace Derek DeCarlo and junior outfielder Ricardo Nanita, got back on the winning end on Friday afternoon crushing the Florida A&M Rattlers 7-1 in Tallahassee. 

DeCarlo, a preseason All-American, went the distance, pitching his first complete game of the season, allowing only five hits and one earned run.
The Golden Panthers wasted no time getting on the scoreboard in the first inning. First baseman Bryan Pullin doubled down the right field line. Nanita then singled, advancing Pullin to third. Senior captain Adam Summerell then gave FIU a 1-0 lead on an RBI groundout.

The Rattlers tied up the score in the bottom half of the inning on a single by Ben Morgan.

But FIU got cooking again in the fifth. Dennis Diaz led off the inning with a walk. After reaching third on a throwing error, the speedy Diaz scored on a wild pitch, giving DeCarlo all the run support he would need. Nanita provided some insurance in the fifth with an RBI double down the right field line, making the score 3-1.

Nanita wasn't done yet though. In the seventh, after a Pullin walk, Nanita doubled to deep right-center field, scoring Pullin and increasing the Golden Panther lead to 4-1. After advancing to third, Nanita scored on another Rattler wild pitch, giving FAMU a four run deficit to overcome.

But DeCarlo gave the Rattlers no opportunities to stage a comeback.

But that didn't stop the Golden Panther offense from adding more runs to the scoreboard in the eighth. Senior outfielder Solomon Frieder led off the inning with a walk, then stole second base. The next batter, Michael Lopez walked, giving FIU runners on first and second. Frieder and Lopez then executed a perfect double steal, putting both runners in scoring position. Michael New then singled home Frieder, and Dennis Diaz brought home Lopez with a bunt, putting FIU up 7-1, which is where it ended.

DeCarlo (2-0), who went undefeated as a freshman last season, has yet to lose a game in his Golden Panther career. The rematch between the two sides, which was scheduled for Saturday afternoon, was cancelled due to rain, and will not be made up.

The Golden Panthers completed the sweep of the Rattlers, winning all three meetings between the two clubs this season.

Headline: Protest, regardless of form, is patriotic
Subheadline: Athlete turns back on flag before games
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
So, how is it that Division-III Manhattanville College women's basketball has grabbed more headlines and spilled more ink than a host of professional sports teams? Because one of its players, senior guard Toni Smith, has done what few professional athletes have had the guts, or the freedom, to do: take a stand.

 At the start of each game, Smith, standing hand-in-hand with her teammates, turned away from the American flag during the "Star Spangled Banner."

And this act of turning her back on the flag has garnered her the kind of attention she never expected. And that isn't necessarily a good thing.

During a recent game, a 56 year-old Vietnam vet, Jerry Kiley, shrouded in an American flag, charged the court during a free throw attempt. He got into Smith's face, calling her a disgrace, before being ejected from the arena. She stood silent while he was escorted away.

At a Feb.11 game against the Merchant Marine Academy, Smith was met with a sea of American flags, many of them brought by fans and others paid for by the academy's student government. And while the crowd jeered at her, chanting "U-S-A!" and "Leave our country!" Smith quietly turned away for the "Star Spangled Banner." She had to look straight down to avoid facing a flag.

But still she did not waiver. She did not hesitate. 

Why would she take that abuse? What conviction would drive her to that?

Those who oppose her views have quickly assumed that she is protesting an impending war with Iraq. They are correct only in part.

In a written statement, Smith, whose player profile lists, "It will be a great day when our schools get all the money they need and the military has to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber," among her favorite quotes, explained that, "For some time, the inequalities embedded into the American system have bothered me...As they are becoming progressively worse, and it is clear that the governments priorities are not on bettering the quality of life for all it's people but rather on expanding it's own power, I cannot, in good conscience, salute the flag.

"The war America will soon be entering," Smith elaborated, "has reinforced my beliefs, while further angering me."

You see, Smith isn't just an athlete. She is a student. A sociology major to be exact. So it seems fitting that her sensitivity to injustice would take precedent over even the venue of her passion: the game. 

After all, she is only doing what all institutions of higher learning ask of their students: thinking for herself, trying to make a difference in the world around her. And we can't blame her for that, can we?

Her critics argue that she is disrespecting the flag, and those who have sacrificed their lives for it. Her critics got everything mixed up. Those that died did not do so for the flag, but rather, what that flag stood for. They died for freedom. They died for justice. They died that all of us might have a better world, or at least a chance at it. That is what they died for, and not some piece of cloth.

Smith did not turn her back on that sacrifice. She did not turn her back on the opportunities this nation gave her. She cannot be viewed as "unappreciative."

In taking a stand, in turning her back on that flag, she epitomized those sacrifices. She turned towards freedom.

Reader's comments ignorant, war on Iraq justified

To the editor:

Shane Howard's rebuttal of Drew Mallo's submission (The Beacon, Feb. 25) carries flaws that need to be addressed. 

Drew submitted a piece that was thought out and compelling, opinion aside. I would like to address Mr. Howard's remarks.

"How can you possibly think this war on Iraq is justified? I thought the war on terrorism was against Afghanistan and the Taliban. The Iraq situation is about nuclear arms, unless I am mistaken."

Well Shane, for those of us who don't have our head in the sand, the connection between Iraq and terror is obvious. 

Not only has Saddam Hussein admitted to sponsoring terror campaigns, he has also authorized and launched attacks against the United States and U.S. interests. 

Even if there is no formal tie to al Qaeda, Saddam is a threat. 

The lesson that most of us learned on 9/11 is that threats need to be dealt with. 

Your sophomore status indicates that you were probably in "your mother country" and not here during the attacks. 

It was a scary time, even here at FIU.

"Until we hear Iraqi citizens come together and ask for help, their problem is not ours, or we'll have another Vietnam War on our hands."

The above is a clear indication of your ignorance. 

Not only is that not the purpose of the U.S.-led campaign, but people who stand up to Iraqi policy are often tortured or killed. 

"If America did not stick its nose into everyone's business then we might not be in this situation."

You may be right. 

But if we didn't than we might all be speaking German and living under a Hitlerian regime. 

In addition, keep in mind that the reason countries like France, Switzerland and Germany can "stay out of it" is because time and again the United States has been there to bail them out. 

We, as the super-power, need to take action to arrest these threats. 

"I'm sure that, we being the super power we are, we have much scarier arms than others do."

The difference is we do not have a history of using those arms against our people. 

Saddam does. Clearly he is dangerous. 

"Drew, you need a reality check because freedom may come at a cost, but it shouldn't be by spilling gallons of blood."

World History dictates otherwise. 

Take a History elective. You still have time.

Hip-hop review does disservice to artist, genre

To the editor:

I wanted to write about Danielle Bienenfeld's review of Common's Electric Circus album. 

Why was she picked to review the album? 

The very first sentence she uses in her review (I'm not really a hip-hop kind of girl..) discredits her entire review. 

If I am reading a review on a hip-hop album, I would expect the critic to know what they're talking about. 

The examples she uses to justify her opinion are weak. She doesn't do a good job of describing the album's flaws. 

It really does the album (and hip-hop in general) a disservice to be criticized by a person with such little knowledge on the topic.

Headline: Concrete ultimatum only solution for Iraq conflict
Author: Eduardo Rodriguez-Perez/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The other day, as I waited patiently at the blue tables for my laptop to boot up, a young woman with pretty eyes came up to me, hoping to recruit me to for the anti-war movement. 

I allowed her to speak her mind, secretly agreeing with her, and politely let her continue her argument. 

One week later, I was out sitting at the same blue tables and I couldn't keep my mind from rationalizing war. 

What changed in that week? Nothing.

I'm still of the belief that war, or any other form of violence, should only be a last resort. 

Not second to last, not if something or other, only a final resort. And only if we've honestly tried everything in our power to avoid it. 

The international political stage has become one in which someone will fall, and it's not necessarily Saddam Hussein. 

Bickering and stalling at the level of the United Nations, a bloated global bureaucracy, have up to this point produced no definitive proof of any sort. 

And in the meantime, the United States builds a massive military force in the area. 

My question is: "When will it all snap?"

This has nothing to do with credibility, or logic. The world is acting solely on fear. And it's not the fear of Saddam actually launching biological weapons at Israel or capturing more oil fields. 

The fear is solely of another 9/11. 

Do you think it's interesting that France and Germany are the most vocal fence sitters? 

If you factor the huge Muslim populations of these countries, it's not that interesting. It's just plain ol' politics at its best. 

And Germany is definitely deterring terrorist activity. After all, they just sent a man to prison for 15 years for his aid in killing over 3,000 people. That's fair, right?

To put all biases and emotions to rest, we have to be logical about the whole process. 

Despite some meager concessions on the part of Iraq, the overall opinion of the U.N. inspectors is that the country is not cooperating fully. Period.

It's time for the United Nations to put this baby to bed. 

And the simple way to do that is to impose a simple, unchangeable deadline for Iraq's complete compliance. 

We can't sit around and wait another month or two. 

We have to stop doubting the world and ourselves. 

The basic aim of terrorists the world over is to instill a constant sense of fear in the target population. 

If the United States, the United Nations, and the rest of the world, succumb to the networks of terrorists around the world, then the 9/11 hijackers didn't just blow up the World Trade Center. 

They also killed the spirit of freedom of our nation and globe. 

And all the United States flags on your cars, and 9/11 posters in store windows, and real feelings of pain mean nothing. It's all in vain.

Headline: Media, politics rooted in sensationalism
Author: John Colagrande Jr./Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
The sky is falling. The sky is falling. Code Orange. Code Orange. We are in a HIGH state of TERROR. 

Tom Ridge, director of the Department of Homeland Security, said recently that Americans should stock up on water, candles, and duct tape in case of a biological attack. Duct tape? Are you kidding me? Always knew that you could fix anything with duct tape. 

Ridge went on to say that we are in a high state of terror and these are necessary precautions. In almost his next breath he explained that the Department of Homeland Security is designed to make us feel safe. If they want us to feel safe maybe they shouldn't use such fear inducing terms like "terror." 

Why can't they use phrases like high level of caution? Or how about using levels of heads up-ness? Can you hear the broadcaster: "heads-up level is low today, folks." 

The "terror" code was recently lowered to yellow but terror is still terror.

Maybe they use "terror" because they want us to feel scared. 

Why would they want us to feel scared? Because if something did happen, then the Bush administration wouldn't come off looking like idiots because they had warned us, but most importantly, fear sells. 

Last week, on MSNBC, there was a little orange box in the corner that reminded us that we were in a high state of terror. This is Chicken Little sensationalism. The media loves sensationalism because exaggeration and fear attracts viewers. It's such a dirty form of journalism. Politics is rooted in sensationalism too. Fear fools the average citizen into the belief that we need a government to watch our backs. 

What does this really do? It scares us and it scares our children. If you were a seven-year-old hearing phrases like high level of terror what would you think? Scaring children is not a business to be proud of. But terror is a serious business. 

There is a terrorist professor at the University of South Florida - lock him up, ruin his life and the lives of his family because he supports a Muslim jihad, because he supports the Palestinian cause. 

It doesn't matter that there are many rich Americans of Jewish descent who support the cause of Israel with money. The Arab-linked man is a terrorist. 

This could be viewed as the beginning of a modern day McCarthyism designed to chase down terrorists with the diligence of a witch-hunt based on circumstantial evidence.

Robin Williams joked in an HBO special that blacks and Hispanics can finally breathe easily because America has found another ethnicity to pick on - Arabs. 

What is sad is that America, from the beginning of our history, has been a country that has made discrimination a way of life. 

I don't want to come off as being unpatriotic because this country is by far the best in the world, God bless America, land that I love, stand beside Her, but I'm Italian so maybe I have more liberties, than, say, an Arab.

Just remember the sky isn't falling but the stock market, consumer confidence, and America's reputation is.

Headline: In Our View: Athlete held to higher academic standard
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Men's basketball holds a lackluster 1-12 conference record. There is much that's questionable about the coaching decisions regarding this season's record.

Taurance Johnson, one of the biggest recruits ever landed by FIU athletics, sat out the season after a series of suspensions, for varying reasons.

His first suspension came at the start of the season. At the time, coach Donnie Marsh said "In order to assist Johnson, I thought it was important to help him refocus on what it takes to be a good college student." Johnson was academically eligible according to NCAA standards.

He played two games, Dec.14 and 18, before again facing a suspension, this time for a missing grade. "University policy is not to allow a student-athlete to dress when this is the case," Marsh said.

While serving that suspension, Johnson's season was ended by another suspension because he "...[had] academic obligations that require his total attention and focus," Marsh said. 

And so the team went on without it's star forward, losing seven conference games by 10 points or less, a number that might have been drastically different if Johnson, who averaged 14.7 points a game in his freshman season, had played.

It's understandable that the program wants its players to be successful students - the athletic program as a whole suffers from low graduation rates as it is - but in this instance, Johnson was never ineligible by the standards set forth by the NCAA, the sanctioning body that governs collegiate athletics. He maintained a GPA higher than the 2.0 required. 

Student-athletes carry a heavy burden as it is. They are expected to make road trips and participate in out-of-state tournaments, which take them out of the classroom for long periods of time. It is unrealistic to ask that they maintain a GPA higher than that which an ordinary student is expected to hold, a 2.0, while carrying that burden.

Headline: Further Seems Forever comes back strong
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Just as I expected, the mainstream emo flame is starting to dwindle. The lifeline has not gone completely flat, said emo bands still thrive in a somewhat "underground" music scene; however, I see less and less indie-rock videos on MTV2 and the commercial radio stations are beginning to move on. 

Let's face it, we all knew it wouldn't last long in the spotlight. Besides, the talented efforts of bands like Further Seems Forever could never appeal to the mindless, bop-rock-craving masses who continue to dumb themselves down with pathetic garbage on television, the radio and all over teen magazines.

Are you wondering if that band name sounds familiar? I'm sure you've all heard of Further Seems Forever and if you haven't then shame on you for not being faithful Dashboard Confessional groupies. Emo poster boy Chris Carraba earned his singing degree when he started and led the small, Pompano Beach band several years ago.  

In 1999, they first appeared on a split EP with Recess Theory entitled From the 27th State and released their first full-length album in 2001, The Moon is Down.  

As you know, Dashboard Confessional was a big hit with the kids, so Carraba handed the microphone over to the hands of Jason Gleason.  For two years, the band toured the world, gaining more and more popularity in "the scene."

This brings us now, to Further Seems Forever's bold new album, How to Start a Fire. For two years, the band was only known for their recordings with Carraba, nothing else existed. Up until now, the only way to get a taste of the new Further Seems Forever was to see them live, which is an experience in itself. Gleason may have proved himself in the live performance department, but how would he fare in the recording studio? Fans have been anxious for this release and I think it's safe to assume they won't be disappointed.

How to Start a Fire is definitely a departure from previous material. One of the first conclusions I came to about this album was that although it is similar to the Further Seems Forever I was used to, it is completely different. 

What the band has been able to do is maintain the powerful essence from The Moon is Down and re-sculpt it into a new entity.  It's not a copy in anyway, but one can really sense the character that defines Further Seems Forever.  Powerful chords, emotional vocals with vengeful lyrics and a subtle kiss of sweetness.

What worried me most about this record was that Gleason might try and emulate Carraba. Fortunately, that's not the case at all.  He's been able to add a new flavor to the band that fits perfectly in their design.  In general, How to Start a Fire is less whiney. Instead, he creates a well-balanced diversity using a very schizophrenic vocal range. 

Hard and biting in songs like "Against my Bitter Judgment," but soft and swooning in "On Legendary."  Then there are roller coaster songs like "The Deep," which implore different singing moods. 

Of course, Gleason pays homage to the classic Further Seems Forever sound with melodic yelling and bellowing, which are executed with professional perfection.

The band also observes this phenomenon of staying the same and changing at the same time. Complex melodies that mix and intertwine with each other and all the right tempos.  

It's a sound that constantly compliments Gleason's voice: very harmonic at times but angry and hard-hitting when necessary.  "A Blank Page Empire" is a song that perfectly exemplifies the great capacity of the band's musicianship.

Though I thoroughly enjoyed listening to How to Start a Fire, it isn't a flawless album. There are many aspects of the band which some may not find too agreeable. Further Seems Forever has turned up the hardcore/distortion notch a bit.  

They've also had to accommodate the differences in the lower-toned Gleason, compared to Carraba's softer and higher-pitched voice. These things aren't necessarily horrible, but it's a difference some may not appreciate. 

The album does a good job of keeping the hokey-ness of the lyrics to a minimum, but sometimes it gets a little repetitive with phrases like "It's been a long time since I've felt the rain upon my head," or "Your idle hands rekindle."  That's a little too campy for me.

At times it's difficult to understand what the heck he's saying at all: even less appealing.  However, these things don't weigh it down so much when the album is looked at as a whole. It's a well-made record.

There is one last complaint I have. Yeah it's a departure from The Moon is Down, and it's fairly original. However, when listened to in comparison with trillion other pop-punk indie rock emo whatever bands out there, it all generally sounds the same. Where is the real originality? This recent trend in emo music could actually prove to be disastrous for the genre, killing the newfound teenage popularity slowly with boredom.

I can't completely discredit this album though. How to Start a Fire does in fact give some hope to a genre plagued with so much fluff and worthlessness.

Headline: Play addresses mental illness
Author: Alexander Blanco / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Fictive rebels without causes have always seemed, to me, to be overwritten characters without clues.At any given moment in a fictional story, you can count on this type of character to either say something irreverent, deliver a deeply emotional speech after acting irreverent or exercise a brutal display of angst-ridden violence after acting out irreverently. 

In William Whitehurst's "Mosshead," directed by Leroy Clark, the central character David Wyatt, an aspiring musician suffering from bipolar dementia and still living with his mother, is no different.He goes through the motions like a checklist: says something naughty about Jesus; shows his inner beauty to his girlfriend, Darlene (played by the exquisitely enticing Christina Perdomo), the only rational character in the play; and ends the plight of the clueless protagonist with a pair of tantrums and a bloody knife in hand. 

That is not to say that the  main character is not compelling or even charismatic enough to pull the audience along for the pair of hours it takes to lead us to its inevitable outcome.On the contrary, Daniel Suarez, as David Wyatt, embodies the role so well that it is quite difficult to discern where actor and character pathology are seamed together.

All that the audience is aware of is the remarkable intuition and insight it must take for an actor to embrace the darker side of nature and acquiesce to its demands.There is not one instance, not even in the humdrum first act, where Suarez is evident and David stifled, so lost is he in the depiction.His performance is worth the price of admission times two.

The cast is excellent, true to their characters at all moments and physically depicting each scene for all its emotional, comedic and sometimes horrific, intensity. One horrendous scene in particular, which graphically shows a questionable sexual encounter and its brutal consequences, is totally believable and quite shocking to see first-hand.The actors in the scene, through their enigmatic portrayals of these characters, embody the symbolic essences of tortured innocence and troubled souls.

In the first act, we are introduced to Becky Wyatt (played by Christy Webb), an overbearing mother of two, David and Kim.Her struggles to keep a stable home in the light of an absentee husband and two mentally handicapped dependents is evident in her nuances and in the method by which she attempts to keep the harmony of her household.

It is heartbreaking to see the beauty behind her haughty and domineering demeanor, the implication that she has had to sacrifice a lot for the sake of her children is painstakingly apparent.

Kim Wyatt (played convincingly by Melissa Amaguer) is David's mildly retarded sister. She stands out as a counterpoint to David's dilemma, only to be exploited of her innocence by play's end.

At times, it seems her only worth is that of comedic foil, but her loss of grace is a fitting conclusion to her character. Her tragedy entails that no one touched by mental decay is left unscathed by the downward spiral of pathology.

Mickey (played by Alex Dominguez) is David's long-hair friend and fellow musician who may harbor less brain cells than aspiring Neanderthals.He bobs along the stage with a light air about him and a singular purpose in mind: to get wasted and play metal music.

If there is a weakness about Dominguez's performance, it is due to Mickey's ill-established persona in lieu of the charismatic Suarez. With what he is given, Dominguez shows exemplary craftsmanship and proficiency, never straying far from the character's boundaries.

The original music in the play is another pleasant surprise. Seeing Suarez strumming an acoustic guitar and singing along to an original tune adds to the atmosphere of the play. 

All in all, Mosshead is a definitive theatrical production worth catching in its abbreviated run. The themes dealt within the play are universal, if a bit on the adumbrated side of experience.

The effort to keep a family together despite opposing forces, both internal and external; the struggles of, and the coping with, mental disabilities; and the entropy of an aspiring musician inhibited by pharmaceutical dependency, are all viable themes in the play. 

"Mosshead" is a clear window to view what mental decay may be like, or may lead to, for those lacking any experience with it.

Headline: "David Gale" fails to bring death penalty issue balance
Author: Krystal Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A Harvard graduate, a professor at Texas University and an anti-death penalty activist makes for an unusual death row inmate. Yet, David Gale, played by Kevin Spacey, finds himself in that exact situation. Gale had the "perfect" life before a series of events destroyed his family, home and spirit. First, he was accused of being a rapist and then convicted for the murder of his friend and colleague, Constance Harraway (Laura Linney). 

As Gale's last attempt at proving his innocence and escaping Death Row, he hires loyal reporter Bitsy Bloom (Kate Winslet). "The Life of David Gale" follows Bloom as she gets engulfed in the murder case and tries to prove Gale's innocence with some help from her silly intern/sidekick Zack, played by newcomer Gabriel Mann.

The movie was certainly entertaining but was unnecessarily preachy with its message. The whole movie centered on overzealous advocates against the death penalty. 

It is no wonder that with this focus the movie revolves on a variety of reasons why one should not support the death penalty.  Instead of actually focusing on Gale and his fall from society, it seemed like a lot of effort was put into how to change the audience's mind. 

With such a bevy of stars there should have been more emphasis on a character-driven story. The movie is called "The Life of David Gale," why would anyone expect Gale to play a minor role next to the movie's major issues?  

The acting is compelling. Both Linney and Spacey deliver an excellent execution of their roles. Both are very believable and make the movie interesting. 

Their characters seem like real people and they have good on-screen chemistry.  However, Winslet's character did seem over the top. 

I doubt any journalist would put themselves in the type of situations Bloom is seen in throughout the movie. It's too bizarre to even think that Connie Chung or Barbara Walters are capable of breaking and entering or tampering with evidence. 

"The Life of David Gale" does however suit an audience that wants to experience a new type of movie. It does not have cliché themes and does have a lasting impact on viewers who may be sitting on the fence as to where they stand on the death penalty issue. 

It will definitely not change the mind of death penalty advocates and it might even make them a little vexed.  As for those who are anti-death all the way, "The Life of David Gale" will definitely add ammo to your arsenal.  

I do recommend anyone with an extra six bucks to see "The Life of David Gale" but be forewarned it may cause some conflict if you and your date don't see eye-to-eye on certain issues. 

This is definitely a movie that gives people something to talk about. 

Maybe, it won't make an audience completely change their minds but it provokes some serious conversational topics. If you go see "The Life of David Gale" bring a chatty friend.

Headline: Forget movies, go to the theatre

&nbsp;
What's all this "Mosshead" stuff about?

"Mosshead" is the drama currently being put on by the FIU theater department. Last week the play was staged at the south campus to audiences that were led to tears. From Thursday to Sunday the play will be at the north campus. 

Why see a movie when you can see a play? There is an extra dimension in seeing a play. Movies are two-dimensional projections on a huge screen. A play is a three-dimensional experience performed live by people you could almost touch; by people that you can, and should, go up to afterwards and converse with. The theater is personal, cozy, cultural and educated. It's an experience.

A theatrical production, when produced correctly, is an experience that is so much more rewarding than a movie. When the set is perfect, the writing crisp, the lighting just right, the acting engaging and the direction flawless; when all the elements of theater come together there is a release you experience that leads you to catharsis. It takes you to the promised land and sends you home covered in goo because the whole experience sticks to you. 

Watching a good theatrical production will keep you on the edge of your seat. Afterward you will feel more human for the experience. 

Being familiar with the Miami theater community, "Mosshead" is a bargain at $6. It's even worth the drive to the North campus.

By attending the theater you are contributing to the local arts. It is so important to support the arts. The arts are the voice of our collective consciences. It's bad enough that artists make such little money, but it is even worse if people don't support them. 

By getting out and seeing Mosshead you are not only showing love for FIU but you are supporting the local arts. You won't be disappointed with the experience.

The Dancer Upstairs

John Malkovich has proved himself as a filmmaker with his film, "The Dancer Upstairs." Malkovich has enlisted the talents of Javier Bardem to star in this detective/mystery/love story.  Bardem plays a detective named Rejas in a South American country who hunts down the leader of a revolutionary guerilla movement and he couldn't have been a better pick.

Through his chase, we discover much about South American culture and political situations.

The cinematography is beautiful.  Malkovich demonstrates his ability to tell the story through the gorgeous settings and camera play. The film's gruesome side cannot be excluded as part of this beauty either.  Its shocking nature at times was done with precision and was horribly realistic.

   "The Dancer Upstairs" is Malkovich's first film, but we can only hope he pursues his newfound career as a director .	              

-John Lovell



Salomé

Following his recent trend of filming the passion and beauty of dance, Carlos Saura has made a new film based on the Biblical story of Salomé. The first "act" of the film follows the "director" (Pere Arquille) talking to designers and dancers, explaining the story and his ideas for the production and the dancers' rehearsals.

This ends with the final call to a dress rehearsal.  The second part is the production itself.  Saura's ability to choreograph the camera to follow the dancers' movements has never been more mesmerizing than in "Salomé."  His trademark use of minimalist sets and contrast lighting are present along with mirrors and giant projections used to enhance the dancers' emotions.  Led by Aida Gomez, former head of the Ballet Nacional de España, the cast passionately reenacts the Biblical story, bringing to life jealousy, sexuality and sorrow like no other interpretation of Salomé ever has.

Historias Minimas

Actors should be very afraid of Argentinean director Carlos Sorin's new film, "Historias Minimas."  

"Historias Minimas" is the story of several characters, each on their own journey to a city named San Julian. 

The attention focuses on three individuals: an old man searching for an unusual old friend, a salesman hoping to surprise an attractive client's son and a shy mother who has a spot in a TV game show. Their paths intertwine with each other along the way in a humorous but at times saddening plot about, simply stated, life.

What makes this film so fascinating is that Sorin has managed to spring up an amazing film using less than the bare essentials. He bravely takes normal, inexperienced people and makes them actors for his film, which was revised to meet their personalities. 

The end result is astonishingly realistic. I don't believe any professional actors could match Sorin's cast.				  

-John Lovell



Eden

Polish director, Andrzej Czeczot's "Eden" is the type of film you just have to see to understand even the slightest concept.

"Eden" is an animated epic,  that tells the history the world from a somewhat biblical point of view. The film has no real dialogue and is seemingly made to confuse its audience. Once you begin to understand what is going on, something changes and drags you back into delirium.

Its artistic value shouldn't go unnoticed. The redeeming qualities of the film lie in its interesting animations, character portrayals and funky music. However, even that might not keep you awake. 

Still, the film is worth at least one viewing so you can decide for yourself.				

-Melissa-Nicole Greco



As Tres Marias

Brazil's "As Tres Marias" is a messy revenge fable done  by its obsessive, almost unnatural attention to symmetry; it wants to dedicate equal time to all the characters and in doing so neglects to develop any of them. The plot concerns itself with three sisters who must find and convince three particular hitmen to kill the three men responsible for the murder of three of the men in their own household. We've heard that bad things come in threes, but this is ridiculous. 

The script has to be one of the messiest ever, with long stretches that contribute nothing to the movie, and short, contrived, suspense-less resolutions to potentially suspenseful situations. 

Overall, the movie is simply a failure; probably one of the coolest premises ever takes us absolutely nowhere.			            

-Hansel Castro



Till Human Voices Wake Us

The genius of "Till Human Voices Wake Us" is in the way it crosses from reality to fantasy without you ever noticing. This film boasts a strong script, subtle but effective direction and an outstanding cast. Sam (Guy Pierce), a psychiatrist in Melbourne, travels to his childhood home to bury his deceased father. Ruby (Helena Bonham Carter) is the woman he meets on the train who later resurfaces, literally, with amnesia and a preternatural knowledge of his past. The film flashbacks between Sam's relationship with Silvy, his first love, and his relationship with Ruby - using water and T.S. Eliot's poem "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" to connect the two. The film is the most stunning depiction of a man's struggles with love and death that I've ever seen.

Headline: 'Classics!' interweaves multicultural dance
Author: Jennifer Sittig / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Department of Theater and Dance program presents its diverse choreographic dance styles in "FIU Dance: Celebrates the Classics!," their 2003 Main Stage production. Performances will be held on Mar. 6 - 8 at 8 p.m. and Mar. 9 at 2 p.m. at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center at the University Park Campus.  

"FIU Dance: Celebrates the Classics!" is made up of choreography and performance by FIU faculty, guest artists and students.  Featured choreographers include Mariana Alvarez Brake, Elena Garcia, Tom Hagood, Katherine Kramer, Louinis Louines, Constance McIntyre and Sherone Price.  

The choreography in each piece varies and includes dance styles such as modern, Afro-Cuban, tap-fusion, ballet, West African and Haitian. The diversity in the production's choreographic dance styles reflects the diversity in the dance program at FIU.    

This multicultural perspective breaks down traditional artistic barriers and allows innovative work to transpire.

The benefits of the performance for students and the public are "inspiration and awareness," said Michelle Orellana, junior, English.  "[The performances] may inspire the audience for further learning."

The preparation for this production started the third week in September 2002, when auditions were held. There, choreographers picked the dancers for their particular choreographed pieces, which they have been working on weekly since the auditions.

 On Feb. 26 and 27, the Dance program performed this production for high school students, which is part of the Dance department's "commitment to young audiences"  said Ana Maria Perez, business manager of the Dance Department.

The Dance program presents a yearly production and is made possible, this particular year, through the support of the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs, the Cultural Affairs Council, the Mayor and the Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners, the Hannibal Cox Jr. grants program, and the Community Grants program.  

Tickets for the public are $12, $10 for FIU faculty and staff  and $8 for students with IDs. Tickets are available at the door or in advance.

8:00 a.m. Un día cualquiera, en una parada de autobuses muy cerca de ti . Llevas una semana en Miami, y ya te vas percatando de que las distancias entre un sitio y otro no son las mismas que pensabas. Te vas acoplando poco a poco a la noción de &#8220;Southwest&#8221;, &#8220;Northwest&#8221;, que la US-1 llega hasta Baltimore y que te digan &#8220;eso es como a cinco cuadras&#8221; se traduce en 30 hora de viaje. Miras el reloj con esperanza y alargas el cuello un poco más para ver si en la lejanía aparece un autobús. Te has preparado con un mapa general  de las rutas y el itinerario dice que pasa uno en  dos minutos más. Tienes fe en que la puntualidad norteamericana cubre los autobuses.

8:30 a.m. La misma parada. Llevas 20 minutos esperando, cuando por fin ves que el bus llega a tu parada. Afinas la vista y ves un reluciente &#8220;NOT IN SERVICE&#8221;. El bus sigue de largo mientras el chofer te dirige una mirada de desahuciado. Ya el sol empieza a asarte un poco y te preguntas por qué en las paradas no hay un triste toldo pero agradeces que, por lo menos, hay un asientito.

8:50 a.m. Por fin llega el ansiado bus, pagas tu tarifa y te das cuenta de que no tienes cambio exacto. El chofer te mira con indifirencia mientras le pides un &#8220;transfer&#8221;. Tienes la opción de sentarte en un asiento al lado del mendigo que expide un olor objetable o de sacar tus habilidades de primate y bambolearte en el tubo, rogando para que el chofer no pegue un frenazo y no caigas sembrado en la falda de la viejita que lleva cinco bolsas de Burdines. 

9:15 a.m. Entre pasar dos semáforos en rojo y tres paradas, has avanzado ya tres cuadras. La viejita de las bolsas de Burdines empieza a contarte cómo sobrevivió a los colmillitos voraces de un tiburón mientras intentaba llegar en balsa de Cuba a la Florida. Un haitiano de &#8220;dreadlocks&#8221; te rompe el tímpano cuando grita &#8220;BACKDOOR&#8221; y pelea con el chofer que se ha pasado la parada. Se monta un anciano flaco con bastón que hace malabares miedosos para sostenerse en el tubo; el constructor de unos 30 años, que está sentado frente a él, lo mira con enojo cuando tropieza con sus piernas estiradas. Un niño llora a decibeles dignos de un Pavarotti, decenas de usuarios del autobús lo ignoran con sus audífonos retumbantes. Ves una revista Auto Mart tirada en el suelo, la boca se te hace agua cuando miras un Jeep reluciente y te imaginas manejando por South Beach como el protagonista de Miami Vice que puede llegar temprano a los sitios. El chofer pega un frenazo y te das cuenta de que esta es tu parada, la 151 St. FIU North Campus.

Headline: Una mujer entre dos mundos
Subheadline: Verónica Van Derdys

Deborah Romano* tenía diecinueve años cuando un viaje a Jerusalén le cambió la vida por completo.  Era la experiencia más gratificante de su vida, como judía, estaba visitando la &#8220;Tierra Santa&#8221; y se sentía en el tope del mundo.  Deborah era una muchacha tranquila pero fuerte de carácter, y había viajado al otro lado del mundo para envolverse más en la religión que sus padres decían profesar.  Quería concebir el verdadero sentido del judaísmo en su máxima expresión, así que tomó un seminario religioso por unos meses y cuando regresó todo era diferente.

Deborah acababa de graduarse de la escuela superior judía &#8220;Hebrew Academy High School&#8221; en la Florida.  Era la década de los ochenta, y Deborah, a diferencia de su descendencia judeo-cubana reformada, decidió convertirse en una judía ortodoxa.

Ha pasado el tiempo y son tantas las cosas y las reglas que esta muchacha tuvo que cambiar y seguir, que, después de catorce años, Deborah continúa su travesía espiritual en el mundo apartado del judaísmo ortodoxo. No se retira, muy a pesar de que reconoce que esta forma de vida no es fácil para nadie.

Con el calor alarmante que fustiga a Miami, Deborah, una mujer de cinco pies de estatura, tez blanca y ojos acaramelados, se mueve dentro de su mundo, vistiendo modestamente y cargando con una peluca en su cabeza que la hace sudar cruelmente y más que nada le produce alergias.  Ella tiene cabello propio, pero ninguna mujer casada que practique el judaísmo ortodoxo puede mostrar su cabellera puesto que es el único regalo de belleza que la mujer le hace al hombre cuando se casa. No hay razón de mostrarlo a nadie de afuera.  Esta es una de las reglas que su comunidad debe seguir sin protestar, cosa que, a pesar del modernismo, estas mujeres siguen al pie de la letra.

Deborah a veces viste en colores oscuros, pero se dio cuenta de que eso es imposible en Miami, el calor es insoportable y los colores sobrios lo atraen más.  

&#8220;Yo me visto de otros colores, es más fresco y hasta me maquillo un poco, ¿por qué no?&#8221;, asegura Deborah, después de mirarse y estirar sus mangas hasta las muñecas, como cubriéndose un poco más, y tocando su peluca.

Una vida de sacrificios

La vida de una mujer judío-ortodoxa en estos tiempos no es fácil. Deborah trabaja fuera de su casa, y aún debe llegar cada día a cocinar una dieta especial y preparar una vajilla y cubiertos distintos solamente para una cena regular. El esposo y los niños de Deborah se rigen por la dieta kosher, que no es más que lo que establece el Torah, sobre lo que se debe y no se debe comer. Nada de mezclas de carne y productos lácteos, nada de cerdo ni animales que se alimentan de desperdicios, nada de pescados sin escamas. Se debe esperar seis horas de digestión si se antoja un helado y ya se había comido carne.  

&#8220;Es una cara purificación del sistema&#8221;, afirma Deborah, quien explica lo costosa que esta dieta resulta ser, ya que los productos kosher son manufacturados de una manera especial y con extrema cautela, lo que los hacen más costosos que cualquier producto comestible regular.

Deborah tiene 33 años de edad y no almuerza en ningún restaurante de comida rápida desde hace años.  Sus colegas del trabajo le hacen bromas y le preguntan si es estrictamente necesario ir a un lugar kosher para poder almorzar con ella. Deborah sonríe y, en su naturaleza amigable, les contesta que sí, que sí es necesario.  

Deborah tiene dos hijos varones, Benjamín y Ali, quienes asisten a escuelas judías y reciben educación extra en la sinagoga. Ella, por su lado, asiste más de una vez a la semana a su congregación religiosa &#8220;Shaaraw Tefillah&#8221; en North Miami. Además, cumple con casi 613 leyes que dicta el libro santo del judaísmo el &#8220;Torah&#8221;, leyes que pertenecen a una homilía del siglo XIII. Son leyes muy diferentes a lo que le enseñaron las escuelas católicas a las que asistió en su infancia, porque sus padres no vivían cerca de una comunidad judía.  

&#8220;A veces es imposible seguirlas, pero una trata&#8221;, son las palabras de una consternada Deborah, cuando recuerda todas las reglas que su familia y ella deben acatar diariamente.

La comunidad judía de Deborah es una donde pocas mujeres trabajan porque sus padres pueden mantenerlas. No obstante, la familia de Deborah no tiene esa &#8220;bendición&#8221;. Su familia necesita que ella trabaje.  Deborah se desempeña, desde hace seis años, como analista de sistemas para una escuela de educación continuada para adultos.  Está a punto de obtener su grado en administración de empresas y actualmente busca una mejor posición laboral para ganar un poco más y adquirir más experiencia.  

Recuerda sus días de recién casada, cuando la religión le exigía a su marido quedarse aislado de ella y de sus responsabilidades en el mundo para asistir a sesiones de día entero de &#8220;escucha y aprende&#8221;, un sistema donde los hombres pasan días completos escuchando las doctrinas de un rabino de la comunidad.  

Durante ese tiempo, el hombre no trabaja, así que Deborah, que no tenía padres pudientes como las demás mujeres de la congregación, tuvo que trabajar turnos de tiempo completo mientras su esposo oraba y aprendía todo el día.  

&#8220;Fue difícil hasta que no pude más y le dije que debía volver a su empleo, porque necesitábamos dinero&#8221;, asegura Deborah.

Son muchas las veces que esta mujer se ha visto en problemas con su esposo, quien es rabino y también técnico químico de farmacéuticas. Aunque es ortodoxa, ella no ve su religión como un impedimento para hacer relucir sus raíces latinas y luchar por lo que merece: respeto.  Los hombres de estas comunidades un tanto radicales favorecen las escrituras y las llevan un poco al extremo cuando algunas de estas lecturas les dan la potestad de mantener a su mujer bajo sus pies y controlada.  Deborah nunca quiso, todo lo hace por voluntad propia.

 La purificación

&#8220;Mi esposo es muy serio, muy formal&#8221;, expresa Deborah al conversar sobre todas las exigencias que los hombres judíos-ortodoxos les hacen a sus cónyuges.  Por ejemplo, es difícil tener que salir de un hogar cuando la mujer experimenta su período menstrual.  Esta comunidad no permite que la mujer se mantenga en su hogar mientras dure su ciclo.  No puede tocar a su esposo ni dormir en la misma cama con él; no puede tocar a sus hijos, simplemente debe esperar varios días porque su cuerpo es considerado &#8220;sucio&#8221; e &#8220;impuro&#8221;.

Todas estas mujeres experimentan la tediosa ceremonia de esperar siete días después de su ciclo para someterse a una limpieza corporal extrema.  Deben limpiarse ellas mismas su área genital con gasas porosas, especiales para esta rutina. Luego, cuando consideran que están limpias, deben ir a un lugar llamado Mikvah, que funciona como un &#8220;spa&#8221;.  Ahí todas las mujeres deben pagar una cantidad monetaria mensual por utilizar sus servicios; ahí se desnudan y comienzan una fase extrema de limpieza.  Deben lavar cada orificio corporal, recortarse sus uñas, lavarse el pelo y no tener ni un gramo de suciedad en el cuerpo. Luego de esto, se someten a una inspección detallada por una fémina que decide si están lo suficientemente limpias como para sumergirlas en la alberca donde se comienzan a purificar.

Esta alberca está conectada subterráneamente a tuberías que llevan a agua de río y mar. Solamente así las mujeres pueden volver a casa y sostener una relación íntima con sus esposos. Durante esos días de regreso, el cuerpo de la mujer está preparado para concebir, porque estas parejas judías-ortodoxas no pueden sostener relaciones íntimas a menos que sea con el propósito de procrear un hijo.  

Deborah estuvo una vez a punto de morir y fue por un embarazo.  Después de dar a luz a sus dos hijos y posteriormente a un &#8220;purificamiento&#8221;, ella concibió de nuevo.  Este embarazo puso en peligro su vida, y solamente por esta razón el rabino líder de la congregación le dio el permiso especial a Deborah para utilizar pastillas anticonceptivas.  Ninguna mujer que siga esta doctrina puede evitar los hijos, debe tenerlos y cuidarlos sin importar las veces que salga embarazada.

Estas comunidades tan exigentes son vistas por los demás como comunidades aisladas que no se relacionan con nadie.  

&#8220;La gente no entiende, somos gente normal, con una decisión hecha, decidimos ser ortodoxos&#8221;, sostiene Deborah animadamente, mientras explica cuán importante fue su decisión porque pensó en su familia.  

Ella quiere que sus hijos practiquen esta religión. Dice que a lo mejor no les será difícil porque nacieron en ella, pero asegura que muchas veces su cambio, aunque lleva años de costumbre, la abruma y la recarga.  

 El Shabbath

Su rutina agotadora comienza todos los viernes. Deborah debe pedir un permiso especial en su empleo para poder salir ese día a las tres de la tarde. Entonces, recoge a sus niños en la escuela e inmediatamente, al llegar a la casa, los baña en agua caliente y ella también lo hace.  

&#8220;Los viernes hay que hacer un millón de cosas, es agotador, además tenemos que aprovechar el agua caliente porque después de las seis no podemos bañarnos con esa agua porque es calentada por el sistema eléctrico&#8221;, dice Deborah.

Después de las seis comienza el aislamiento. Cada judío ortodoxo se recoge en su hogar y se dedica a comer en familia. Toman una comida semi-caliente, ya que no pueden utilizar ningún aparato eléctrico, no pueden encender luces ni pueden trabajar.  Deborah es la encargada de todo; ella cocina corriendo, prepara los minuteros de las luces y el aire acondicionado y se alista para que a las seis de la tarde el mundo se vuelva abstemio y místico en su propio hogar.  El esposo reza, los niños escuchan y Deborah observa.  Cada uno tiene una pequeña vasija con agua para lavarse las manos para poder tocar el pan; esto es una costumbre ortodoxa ya que el pan es sagrado y no se puede tocar con las manos contaminadas.  La noche pasa en silencio y todos se relajan para descansar.

Durante el sábado, Deborah pasa el mayor de los trabajos. Debe preparar a los niños para la sinagoga, tratar de organizar la comida pre-cocinada y, muchas veces, tienen que come alimentos fríos, puesto que no pueden calentar ni cocinar nada. La vida es complicada para Deborah, pero ella lo acepta con esmero y dedicación.

 En dos mundos

Cuando Deborah decidió cambiar, se acercó a la comunidad Lubavitch por un tiempo, pero entendió que la vida de las mujeres en esa comunidad era tan oscura como sus ropas. Ella sabía que estar encerrada en el hogar sin mirar a los ojos a nadie no era parte de su personalidad.  Así llegó a su congregación en North Miami.

&#8220;La comunidad a la que asisto, aunque me da lástima decirlo, se deja llevar por el dinero, y si no tienes, no te ayudan, pero es la única cerca de mi casa y a mi esposo le gusta&#8221;, asegura una contundente Deborah, cuando se refiere a su congregación.  

A esta comunidad asisten y pertenecen muchas personas influyentes y pudientes dentro del círculo ortodoxo.  Existe la competencia entre las familias y mucha gente decide alejarse.

De hecho, las parejas recién casadas pueden cumplir con todos los preceptos porque sus padres tienen tanto dinero que los sostienen económicamente para que la mujer pueda estar en la casa mientras el esposo estudia.  

&#8220;Yo nunca pude hacer eso, yo tuve que trabajar&#8221;, son las palabras de Deborah, cuando recuerda sus experiencias de recién casada y madre primeriza. Esta comunidad exige un contacto constante y donación de dinero, según Deborah. Después de que ella tuvo a su hijo y las responsabilidades la hicieron alejarse un poco de la sinagoga, todos los miembros comenzaron a dejar de tratarla y a echarla a un lado.  

&#8220;Ellos te fuerzan a unirte más a la comunidad sin importar tus responsabilidades. Tienes, prácticamente, que vivir allí, y yo decidí no hacerlo&#8221;, dice Deborah. Ella responde afirmativamente cuando reacciona ante esas exigencias y comprende que tiene una vida que hacer fuera de su religión, como trabajar y sufrir como cualquier otra persona. En definitiva, dice que muchas veces se siente frustrada y decepcionada del lugar que ha elegido para encontrar a su Dios.

Lo último que Deborah ha decidido experimentar es mudarse del área &#8220;para ver sin encuentra otra comunidad un poco más humilde, pero ortodoxa&#8221;.  Quiere vivir más tranquila o, al menos, no quiere tener que ser parte de una competencia &#8220;tonta&#8221; por quién es más bueno que otro según el dinero que posea.  Esto lo debe consultar con su esposo; aún no se lo ha dicho, no sabe qué esperar.  Ella sí sabe, con certeza, que seguirá con su historia ambigua, en donde dos mundos se juntan en su mente y su alma y asimismo le barajan su existencia cada día.  

Para Deborah, vivir en un mundo sobrio en las noches y encontrarse con una diversidad intermitente cada mañana cuando sale a trabajar es una como &#8220;vivir en la cuerda floja del tiempo&#8221;.

&#8220;Antes yo era más feliz, pero lo hago por mis hijos, quiero que ellos sean personas de bien, yo lo decidí&#8221;, dice Deborah. Ella entiende que ésta es su responsabilidad y que la única manera de llevarla a cabo es viviendo esa vida; una vida imprecisa que muchas veces le exige el retraimiento y la rutina, y otra que le presenta la realidad del mundo que la rodea, del cual es parte importante, y de la cual, sin importar su esposo, sus creencias y su congregación, no puede desbandarse, esconderse o escaparse para siempre.
