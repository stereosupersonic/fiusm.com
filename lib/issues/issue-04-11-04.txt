Headline: College students - especially freshmen - battle weight gain

KANSAS CITY, Mo.  - There's one part of the freshman curriculum that McKenzie Tyrrell is determined to skip.

That would be the Freshman 15, the zipper-straining weight gain that, according to conventional wisdom, accompanies a student's first year away from home when she or he is surrounded by the temptations and stresses of college life.

Tyrrell started hearing and worrying about becoming a chubby college coed back when she was a high school senior in Boulder, Colo. The older girls would return home from college with, if not visibly larger posteriors, chilling tales of tighter pants.

"They were talking about how it's something that's going to happen," said Tyrrell, a freshman at the University of Kansas. "They were saying it's hard to prevent because of the all-you-can-eat whenever you want (dormitory food) and the partying."

Tyrrell, for one, is taking preventive action. She works out almost every day ... OK, since she's gotten "off track" it's really been more like three days a week.

But at her all-you-can-eat dormitory cafeteria, she tries to keep her portions reasonable. And as for pizza and beer, she hardly ever ... well, she does occasionally join her dorm-mates in a gooey cheese-covered late-night snack. But she hardly ever washes it down with a cold brew.

Given the potent combination of bountiful eats, lots of pressure, plenty of food-focused socializing and an absence of parental limits, Tyrrell said, "I can totally see this happening."

It happened to Julie Carey, a junior from Springfield, Mo. She shed 20 pounds in her last year of high school. They returned during her freshman year at KU.

"It wasn't something I worried about," she said, finishing dinner with her usual dining companions, three sophomore friends. "Some women are really concerned. Being overweight anyway, I wasn't concerned with my body image."

Socializing and easy-access dormitory food are a set-up for weight gain, Carey found. Even if she'd already eaten lunch, for example, Carey might consent to accompany her roommate to the cafeteria. And while she was there, it seemed she might as well pick up a bowl of ice cream so her friend wouldn't eat alone.

"That's the only time a lot of us have to talk," Carey said. "Otherwise I'm busy with meetings and homework."

When she eats alone, she said, "I grab a sandwich and leave. I don't stick around for ice cream."

It's hard to say just how many students pack on the pounds. The third- or fourth-year student who has gained 20 pounds since the start of freshman year "is a pretty common scenario," said Ann Chapman, a dietitian at KU's Watkins Memorial Health Center. She counsels students about eating issues. 

"One of the things that impresses me is how students let weight creep up on them ... 20 or even 40 pounds over two or four or five years. Some are shell-shocked they've gained that much."

Joe Donnelly, who directs KU's Center of Physical Activity and Weight Management, has studied eating and exercise habits among the school's students.

Although conventional wisdom targets freshmen as the weight gainers, Donnelly said a study he has conducted at KU suggests that it's the upperclassmen, not the freshmen, who are putting on the pounds. 

"As far as we can tell, it isn't 15. It's probably more like 5, or maybe 8," he said. Some students are still growing - taller, that is - and for them, weight gain isn't necessarily a health issue. But for those who are growing only thicker, Donnelly said, 5 or 8 pounds in a year or two "is quite a bit of weight." And it's often just the start.

College can be a fattening experience for some obvious reasons, Donnelly said.

"KU has food everywhere. Lunchrooms are all-you-can-eat. There are pockets of food all over campus. There's vendor stands in both unions. The new school of education, they immediately put in a cafe. These things are all over the place."

"My legs are definitely in shape. I walk literally everywhere," said Anjanee Reeves, who was dining with two other non-bus riders at Mrs. E's cafeteria, on Daisy Hill next to Lewis Hall. Reeves, a freshman from Kansas City, Kan., guessed she walks 40 minutes a day.

To get a better understanding of college weight gain, KU's Donnelly and Debra Sullivan, an associate professor in the department of dietetics and nutrition at the University of Kansas Medical School, have been watching what the students in Lawrence are eating. At KU, as among most adults, weight gain seems to be a greater concern among women than men.

One of their findings: Even students who buy a standard meal plan that provides on average 10 or 12 meals a week "typically eat 55 percent to 60 percent of their meals outside the cafeteria," Sullivan said. 

Compared to students from an earlier era, Sullivan said, "They seem to have more indiscriminate money and to eat outside the dorms. I paid for a meal plan, and I ate my meals there."

The timing of that discretionary food is part of the problem, Sullivan said .

"A significant chunk of the day's energy comes after 8 at night," she said. And that generally means one thing: pizza. Or maybe two: pizza plus beer.

"You're studying at night, and you're stressed or bored," Sullivan said. "And there is that socialization factor. You're not hungry, but somebody says, `Let's buy a pizza.'

Although the cafeteria invites students to make a sack lunch in the morning, few actually do that, Chapman said. "And many of them skip breakfast, so you lose that structure. Their eating becomes more erratic, there's more late-night eating, more fast food. And more alcohol."

"Undereating leads to overeating," Chapman said. "A lot of students get into a pattern of that. They're not eating breakfast because they want to sleep in. They grab something quick for lunch, and then they eat a huge dinner and feel terrible, both physically and emotionally. There's a lot of guilt associated with overeating, especially with females.

The program now encompasses snack foods in vending machines and at convenience stores on campus. 

That translates into baked instead of fried chips, granola bars instead of candy bars, and bags of seeds and nuts.

There are no data yet on the response to the healthier-food campaign, but Chapman said that may happen soon.

While they may make some impact, the best efforts of the university's food service won't counter all of the forces driving college students to overeat.

Headline: Despite losses, there is still hope for football
Author: Messod Bendayan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Before the season began, I wrote an opinion piece talking about football's move to Division I-A and how it was premature. 

I figured it would get some people mad - notably, those involved with the program - and that did happen. 

What I didn't expect was the reaction it got from others - good and bad.  It was the most-read sports article in The Beacon website for that issue.

So when The Beacon asked me to write another piece, I figured it'd be a good idea to look back at that old article and see how much progress has been made; especially since we've seen this team in action for the first six games of the season. 

My original article was based on five main points:

1) "The Golden Panthers' all-time record: seven wins, 16 losses, was mostly against Division I-AA schools." 

There are nine wins and 20 losses now. A 2-4 record is not a good sign, especially since at least two of those losses should have been wins. 

2) "FIU has never won a road game." 

Not anymore. Both wins have been away from FIU, including a surprising win against No. 5 Stephen F. Austin. It isn't what Florida Atlantic is doing (11 straight road wins and counting), but it's a big step in the right direction.

3) "FIU has never beaten a scholarship opponent."

Like No. 2, this is true no more. The win versus Youngstown got FIU off the schnide, but the Lumberjack game that showed fans for the first time what FIU is capable of doing. It's a very positive sign.

4) "FIU has averaged roughly 7,000 fans a game, 8,000 short of what they need to stay I-A."

Hurricanes cancelled the first two home games.

The Lafayette game saw FIU barely crack 10,000. The McNeese game couldn't get to 9,000, even with rappers Method Man and Redman performing a free concert. 

Homecoming should see an increase, and the showcase contest against Florida A&M could draw over 20,000 fans if FAMU fans attend.

Petitioning the NCAA to waive the attendance requirement for this year is a viable option, if its Board of Directors doesn't decide to waive it first. But, it's not a good sign that FIU is nearly 6,000 people short of what they need. 

They'll need mother nature to stay out of the way. Some wins would help too.

5) "FIU Community Stadium needs a makeover."

Plans are in place to create a new stadium within the next couple of years, if sponsors are found. 

Overall, the season has been disappointing so far. While both of the wins were big, we're still seeing an underachieving team. I won't punish them for the Cajuns game; they played tough against one of the better teams in the Sun Belt. The disappointments were the other losses.

A 17-0 lead against Louisiana-Monroe degenerated when the Indians started chucking the ball and FIU couldn't stop them.

A 24-0 lead vs. McNeese melted away when the defense folded like a tent and the offense couldn't run or pass the ball with consistency. 

The penalties in the game hurt FIU. That should be unacceptable.

The run game was fantastic against New Mexico State and it kept both teams even for a at least the first half.

But the passing game had another sub-par performance, and the defense couldn't catch a fly, much less an Aggie.

With that said, there's no reason to give up hope. FIU still has a chance to prove that they are capable of handling a full Division I-A schedule next season, but it won't be easy. 

I only see one game left where FIU is the favorite (FAMU). Georgia Southern (ranked No. 2 in I-AA) will be much tougher than the team FIU lost to last season, and Western Kentucky (ranked No. 7 in I-AA) is no cakewalk. 

Don't forget Florida Atlantic; they've looked amazing all season, cruising to a 6-1 record. 

If FIU can get it together and play like they're capable of playing, a .500 record by season's end is possible. 

If they do it, I like their chances when they go to a mostly I-A schedule next season, even though they still haven't beaten an I-A team. 

That's asking a lot, but they have the talent to make it happen.

So go on, boys. Prove you can do it. Just remember this: Time is running out.

Headline: Soccer wins back to back games
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a rematch of the 1996 NCAA Title Game, the Golden Panthers brought their A-Game and got their long-awaited revenge against No. 9 St. John's team, winning 2-1 on Oct. 29. 

FIU started the game very slowly and sloppy by falling behind 1-0 in the first half, but eventually the team got their act together and came from behind to score two goals to record one of their biggest wins of the year. 

"We played a very, very good team that is very difficult to beat," said head coach Karl Kremser. 

The match was filled with intensity and emotions, as expecations for the team have been high since the beginning of the season.  

Kremser's goals are to reach the NCAA tournament, like last year.  

During a tough defensive battle the two teams remained scoreless for the first 30-plus minutes of the match. 

Then, St. John's was able to jump ahead at the 34:57 mark, when Steven Old recorded his fourth goal of the season on a difficult header, assisted on a perfect free kick from Andrei Gotsmanov.

The Golden Panthers trailed 1-0 going into halftime, as they had several opportunities, but were not able to convert them into scores. 

Players knew that they would get their act together and pull out a victory in the second half.

"We knew we could win this game all along, it was just a matter of time for us," said  senior Fernando Plentz after the game.

The intensity then soared in the second half, as the play became more physical and the Red Storm collected a total of five yellow cards, including numerous confrontations between opposing players. 

"In the second half we kept our attitude up. We never gave up, and we just played our game and got the goals," Plentz said.

FIU capitalized on its first break when Carron Williams broke free by putting a move on the defender and nailing the ball into the net from the top of the box in the 79th minute of the match, knotting the score at one.

 It was all Golden Panthers from there on out, as the momentum of the game clearly shifted to FIU. 

"We showed a lot of resiliency and we just kept pecking away," Kremser said.

The winning goal came in the midst of several, loud chants from the fans. It energized the Golden Panthers to victory. 

Allen Handy made a great pass to Plentz, who took care of the rest and drilled the ball past the St. John's goalkeeper in the 84th minute of the match. 

"I don't think I've seen a prettier goal than the one Fernando scored," Kremser said.

The FIU goalkeeper Shawn Crowe played one of his better games this season; he contributed immensely. He finished with four total saves, which included two spectacular saves that erased sure goals off the scoreboard. 

"I thought Shawn Crowe had come back," exclaimed coach Kremser. Dailey Reed of St. John's finished with three total saves.

The victory propels FIU to (7-5-0) overall and drops the Red Storm to (9-4-4) for the season. 

In the end, it was only fitting that a game of this magnitude would end on a controversial call. 

With FIU leading 2-1 and about five seconds left in the match, the referee called a foul on the Golden Panthers at the top of the box. 

But, as the Red Storm players were setting up for the free kick, time expired, and upon coach Kremser's request, the sideline official informed the referee; sending the team and the fans into elation. 

"Look, time expired, go tell him, go tell him," coach Kremser said explaining the final play.



Oct. 30: FIU 2, FDU 0



After picking up an emotionally charged victory against No. 9 St. John's, the Golden Panthers returned to the FIU Soccer Stadium on Oct. 30 and shut out Fairleigh Dickinson 2-0. 

With the win the Golden Panthers improved to (8-5-0), winning five of their last six games, including two straight this weekend to win the FIU Invitational. 

"I feel like we're finally coming together," said FIU head coach Karl Kremser.

The Golden Panthers jumped out to an early 1-0 lead, when junior Jared Rose connected on a penalty kick in the 20th minute, as he recorded his fourth goal of the season. 

The goal was all FIU needed for this one, as Rose provided his first game-winner of the season. 

The Golden Panthers then added an insurance score when Oscar Gil made a great move on the defenders and scored his third goal of the season in the 87th minute, giving FIU the 2-0 win. 

 FDU did not have many opportunities, as the Golden Panthers completely shut down their offense, allowing only one total shot on goal throughout the match.  

FIU goalkeeper Shawn Crowe played another superb game, as he finished with one save and picked up his second shutout of the season. 

FDU (8-6-1) goalkeeper Antonio Treglia recorded five saves in a losing performance.

FIU's Allen Handy was named the tournament defensive MVP for his outstanding performance during the two games, while Andrei Gotsamov of St. John's earned the offensive MVP for his three-goal effort in the 5-0 Saturday win against USF.

The Golden Panthers return to action on Nov. 5 when the team takes on the conference opponent Adelphi.

Headline: Student questions odd smell at Biscayne Bay Campus
Author: Arianne Britt / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Biscayne Bay Campus is an extraordinary sight located along Biscayne Bay and in the heart of North Miami. 

It's the perfect place for a marine biology program, a nice day of kayaking ­­­­­- and landfills. That's right, landfills.

  Luckily, the Munisport Landfill that once surrounded the campus is now inactive. 

However, after a class discussion in which questions arose about the smell that floats through the air every time it rains at the FIU Biscayne Bay Campus, I decided to find out the truth about the dump that became a haven for higher education.

The area formerly known as the Munisport Landfill, is bordered by Northeast 151 St., which is the street you must drive along to reach BBC. 

In 1972, after purchasing 300 acres of land in 1970, the City of North Miami leased 291 acres to Munisport, Inc.    From 1974 to 1980, Munisport operated a landfill to fill low-lying areas of the site, with plans to build a recreational facility in the future. 

During this time, the landfill amassed over six million cubic yards of waste.  

The many materials the site collected included household garbage, construction materials, industrial trash and hazardous waste.

In the meantime, BBC, then called the North Campus, opened in 1977. 

If you take a look at FIU's history, the landfill was disguised by calling the site a "former Interama site." Nonetheless, the landfill finally had neighbors, academia.

 In 1981, Florida and Federal authorities revoked Munisport's operating permit, after hearings and lawsuits about permit violations and noncompliance at the landfill. 

The site was investigated by the Environmental Protection Agency, and they found  no threat to humans or any species of college student. Nevertheless, the EPA considered the site a threat to the environmental health of the area, because it released more ammonia into the environment than is naturally useful.

The county removed some hospital waste, and the EPA made plans to treat the water and put the landfill back into the hands of the state.

The landfill site was altered by digging eight burrow pits over 16 acres of land and filling them with water to cover  the old landfill waste. 

And, even though the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has reported that the soil, sediments, surface water and ground water are contaminated, you will only see warning signs if you slow down and look extremely closely when driving down 151 St. on your way to class.

    So why does the campus smell when it rains? I say, it's because it is next to who knows what kind of toxic waste and chemicals. Is this frightening? A little. 

Has anyone been seriously injured? No. Does the rain make everything smell stank? Definitely.

Headline: How can we save Miss America?
Author: Lenore Skenazy / New York Daily News
&nbsp;
So, ABC is dropping the Miss America Pageant but signing on for another nine episodes of ``Desperate Housewives''? Where is the logic in that? 

A girl spends 10 years learning how to play the ukulele and ABC couldn't care less. But have her tear off her clothes, French-kiss a sweaty gardener and moan off camera and somehow that is supposed to be more interesting to American audiences?

Whatever happened to our long-standing love affair with the flaming baton? 

Does no one give a darn anymore about roller ballet? Do ABC execs think it's easy to juggle fruit while singing Neil Sedaka tunes?

It is not!

Or at least, I always assumed it wasn't, and gave those girls extra points on my scorecard.

This was an annual rite in my home, of course, and in everyone else's home, too, for many years. 

In 1961, for instance, 75 percent of all American TVs were tuned to the pageant. (And 76 percent of all little girls sat watching in sashes made of toilet paper.)

Last year, however, only 9.8 million people watched _ one for every reference to the ever-so-serious scholarship aspect of the contest. (Bathing suit competition? What bathing suit competition? Oh, that bathing suit competition.)

Still, it seems pretty clear that rather than dropping the show, ABC could have had a red-hot hit on its hands with just a little tweaking. Why, oh why, didn't they try:

TRADING FACES 

Pairs of contestants are given lipstick, rouge, eye shadow, glue, fake hair and Magic Markers. Time to trade make overs!

REAR FACTOR 

Combining speed and surprise, contestants attempt to take a bite out of one another's fannies. Staff surgeons from "The Swan" stand by.

SURVIVE HER 

Girls are dropped onto a desert island ruled by a bitter has-been (Kathie Lee Gifford). Which of Cody's 50 potential baby-sitters will please the lady of the land _ and which will be sent to the sweatshop?

THE BACHELOETTE'S

 DEGREE

One handsome (and, unfortunately, married) professor presides over an honors seminar filled with female students from every state. 

Each week, these coeds write papers and contribute thoughtful insights to class discussion while dressed in pushup bras and high heels. Whose grade will be the first to inflate?

I'M A BEAUTY PAGEANT BIMBO, GET ME OUT OF HERE! 

Contestants gather on the edge of an active volcano, where they have their choice of tap-dancing, cart wheeling or unicycling their way around the rim. Last one unconsumed by sulfurous flames wins!

WORLD PEACE

 Instead of just talking about world peace, these brave beauties go out and make it happen in their choice of exotic locales _ Fallujah, the Gaza Strip, North Korea or the Bronx _ dressed only in Red Sox T-shirts.

Red states. Blue states.

Pink ribbons. Red ribbons. Yellow bracelets.

Green Party.

Orange terror alert. 

What can brown do for you? 

Need I say more? Suddenly our lives, and our allegiances, have become color-coded. It's as if we've done away with words to state our states of mind. I wonder why. Are we too busy to take the time to explain our beliefs? Or are we just tired of listening?

I'd like to think the move toward color is good, that it's a bold stride away from seeing the world in simple black and white but it isn't.

Instead of inviting questions, conversation or even a bit of analysis, our Crayola-colored platforms have become just another form of shorthand.

First we embraced sound bites that reduced complex thoughts to simple phrases. Then we moved to text messages that turned conversations into new-age hieroglyphics (C U L8TR). 

Now we don't even bother to speak. Just flash a color and be done with it. 

If you ask me, it's a giant step backward. We've all painted ourselves with such broad brush strokes that there's no room for shades of gray.

Red string around your wrist? You're an alternative-thinking, yoga-practicing follower of kabbalah. Probably vegan, definitely for animal rights and Pilates. Rainbow flag flapping outside your door? Gay.

 I can remember when being blue meant being sad, when Big Blue stood for IBM. Now, blue is a discount airline, or a troupe of men painted indigo performing on Broadway. 

And oh, the things yellow has seen! In old cowboy movies it stood for cowardice. During the Jimmy Carter-era hostage crisis it represented hope and remembrance. Now, Lance Armstrong has usurped the primary color, with his LiveStrong rubber bangles.

In mommy circles, pink still stands for baby girls and Barbie. But once that kid gets out of elementary school, she'll know that the cheerful shade of rose veers toward the darker side of womanhood, especially in October. 

Don't act surprised. If you've ever owned a T-shirt, mug or bumper sticker that says I  (HEART) N.Y., you've contributed to our painter's-palette world. The day you slapped an oval decal on your car touting your vacation spot (VT, OBX, OC), you joined the wordless revolution. 

I mean, honestly, where did we expect the nation to head after that? America has become a living version of the Candy Land board game for ages 3 and up. Truth is, there isn't much we can do about it. 

Except raise a white flag and surrender.

Subheadline: Journalistic rights must be respected for all events
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It was inarguably an honor to have one of a series of Florida senatorial debates held at FIU's Universtiy Park campus last week, especially because of the prestige and political interest it brought to the university. 

However, while The Beacon covered the story, it was surprised to find out that The Miami Herald would exclusively photograph it. 

A newspaper that serves the public has the duty to cover politics;  however, the notion of the press sponsoring a political event appears strange. The two entities should remain unlinked, mainly as it is a question of ethics. However, the ability of all media to be able to participate in such events and fully communicate information to the masses is also of importance.

Because of "security measures," the reason why photographers could not document the event, the sponsors did not allow any media except for the Herald to enter the debates. It was most unfair that The Beacon was excluded from taking pictures of an event that occurred on campus. As a student newspaper, the range of events that we cover must be geared to what's within campus walls and when those options become censored, even if just by photographic rights, journalism becomes tainted. The small steps that we take to become legitimate and respected are halted and that is a plight we shouldn't have to face.

Subheadline: Lack in food variety and over-pricing at FIU's food court  encourages student to eat off campus
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
I get a sinking feeling in my stomach every time I walk by the food court area of GC. 

The lack of variety in terms of food choices is simply unbearable. 

Not only are the menus redundant and overpriced but also the quality of the food is anything but palatable. 

I would much rather spend twenty minutes driving than spend an equal amount of time in the lines for Subway. This lack of patronage amounts to a decline in profits for the university. 

If those in charge of the school's finances see a sharp drop in returns from the rubbish peddlers they call restaurants, it's because they are not keeping their consumers satisfied. 

The simple solution would be to offer a greater variety of food, perhaps a pizza place? A Burger King? 

I'm sure a franchise owner would jump at the chance to have a store open in such a busy campus. 

So until this problem is rectified, I will continue giving my money to the Taco Bell across the street.

Headline: "Embarrassing"
Subheadline: Team fails to keep up with Aggies, lose third straight
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It could be called a second half curse or just a second half slump but whatever the situation is, it's definitely costing FIU football games.

FIU (2-4) lost 56-31 on Oct. 30 to Division I-A opponent New Mexico State (3-5) at a chilly Aggie Memorial Stadium in front of 14,472. 

Both teams got off to explosive offensive performances as the Aggies edged FIU by only a field goal at halftime by a score of 31-28.

Things didn't go FIU's way in the second half however, as NMSU outscored the Golden Panthers 25-3.

FIU head coach Don Strock wasn't pleased after the game with the performance of his team, particularly the defense.

"Defensively, it was embarrassing," said Strock. "We didn't do anything. You can't catch up if you don't have the ball."

With the loss, FIU wasted the efforts of senior running back Rashod Smith who finished the game with 232 yards rushing on 24 carries. 

Smith scored a school record four touchdowns on runs of 76, 73, 2 and 2 yards, all in the first half.

"That was probably the best first half I've had in my football career," said Smith who had 204 rushing yards in the first half. "Everybody was pumped up at halftime and ready to come out and finish the game strong, because we haven't finished a game yet this season."

Smith however, ran out of power in the second half, as both he and FIU had no answer for the Aggies.

"I started to hit the holes slow in the second half, and mainly I just started cramping up," he said.

The defense once again struggled as it allowed 646 yards of total offense, 429 coming on the air. Aggies quarterback Buck Pierce finished the game nearly perfect, hitting 27 of 35 passes for three touchdowns. 

Pierce's main target was wide out Tim Tolbert who totaled up 126 yards and two touchdowns.

The 56 points given up by FIU was the most in school history. The previous high was 55 against Western Kentucky in 2002. The Golden Panther defense didn't force the Aggies to punt in the game.

"It's not a mystery, that team was just a better team than we were," said defensive coordinator Bernard Clark. "What it boils down to, New Mexico [State] has a better football team."

During the first half, FIU was in the red zone at the one-yard line and failed to score on fourth down. Going for it backfired on the FIU coaching staff.

"The disturbing thing was that we went on it in fourth down at the one yard line thinking they couldn't possibly go 99 yards, and they did," Strock said. "We didn't make any plays defensively."

The Golden Panthers opened the game strong scoring on the first drive, striking first for the third consecutive week. 

Quarterback Josh Patrick completed a 40-yard pass to Chandler Williams, setting up a two-yard touchdown by Smith. 

After a New Mexico State field goal and touchdown, FIU answered right back with a 73-yard touchdown run by Smith.  A big block by full back Adam Gorman set up the run as FIU led 14-10.

The Aggies answered back with another touchdown on a seven-yard pass from Pierce to Jared Quick.

FIU then missed on a fourth and one at the one-yard line. NMSU followed by completing its longest drive of the season, 99 yards on 11 plays. The FIU secondary struggled as a pass from Pierce sailed over the head of corner back Matt Castillo in the end zone to give NMSU a 24-14 lead.

 The secondary was without senior and leader Greg Moss, who has been bothered by a sore hamstring. Freshman Lionell Singleton and senior Kevin Tomothee were ineffective replacing Moss. Both struggled but according to Strock, it was part of the teams domino affect.

"They all struggled. Everyone struggled," said a fuming Strock after the game.

Smith's 76-yard run erased the deficit to 24-21 but the Aggies had some tricks in the playbook.

On the ensuing drive, NMSU lined up with three linemen instead of five. 

The outside guards were set as wide receivers, including four on the left side. Pierce was quarterback under center and lateralled the ball to back quarterback Joey Vincent who was lined up at wide receiver. Vincent then completed a 47-yard pass to Tolbert as the FIU defense looked stunned.

Smith scored a 2-yard run to end the half 31-28 NMSU. The FIU offense disappeared in the second half putting up only three points on a 28-yard kick by Adam Moss. It was the ninth straight field goal by Moss.

The loss is the third straight for FIU who started the season 2-1. The Golden Panthers have yet to defeat a Division I-A opponent in the three-year history of the program.

Subheadline: Kovens Center
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Have you ever walked into the Kovens Conference Center? Well, NASA, IBE and General Motors are among the multi-million dollar companies that call it home.

The South Florida Chapter of Meeting Professionals International voted this state of the art audio-visual equipment facility the number one venture of the year. Located on the Biscayne Bay Campus,  it is a premier center for corporations looking for a place to have meetings, conferences and seminars. Anything from a major scientific meeting to a wedding can be held here.

"Conferences, seminars, staff retreats or special events like baptisms and weddings. Anything that you can think of, anybody that needs a meeting space, we provide it," said Seenu Ramalingam, acting director and event and conference service manager.

The Center was built through the College of Continuing and Professional Studies with state money designated for business education and continuous learning. 

After they used the money set aside to build the facility, Roz and Cal Koven invested personal money to finish the project.

"After we went short on money, Roz, Cal and the Kovens family came in and invested a lot of money that helped us complete the building," Ramalingam said. "To honor their donations, we named it the Roz and Cal Kovens Center.

Despite being located on public property, neither the government nor FIU provide funds to run the facility. It is a self-sustained non-profit organization. 

Earnings from events held at the center go to the operation of the building. Left over money is used for facility expansions and upgrades.

The Kovens Center won the award by beating out the Westin Diplomat Club and Spa and the Boca Raton Resort and Spa, two of the major conference centers in Florida. 

Winning the award over prestige hotels was a big accomplishment for the Kovens Center.

"We were competing with two big hotels. These are big players we were up against, and we took it right off the floor from them," Ramalingam said. "We got the award for best customer service and high-tech meeting facility with the latest technology in terms of audio-visual services."

The award also means more clients will consider using the facility.

"Winning the award is a leverage to show our potential clients that we are a serious facility," said Jennifer Fucci, marketing director for the Kovens Center.

Despite being an academic facility, the center won the award, showcasing a different accomplishment for the university. 

"It helps us in terms of bringing our name recognition. We excel not only in academics, but we have an excellent conference center," said Biscayne Bay Campus Vice Provost Raul Moncarz.

Moncarz credits the centers' staff for making it the number one venue.

"The human factor has been the deciding factor in making it a success," Moncarz said. 

Though the facility operates independently from the university, the Kovens Center works with the school of Hospitality Management majors. 

According to Ramalingam and Fucci, FIU students are constantly being hired in order to gain first-hand knowledge and an inside look into the hospitality profession.

"[The students] bring the energy and new ideas. Their creativity and excitement is very invaluable to us," Fucci said.

The Center offers technology like videoconferencing, webcasting and web conferencing, LCD projectors and Internet 2 (I2) technology. Internet 2 is a new technolgy used to transmit web conferencing, which other companies have yet to come across. This provides an advantage for the Center.

"The technology is much more advanced, because of that, we do have an edge [over other companies]. We do have some kind of monopoly when it comes to video and web conferencing," Ramalingam said.

Headline: College students - especially freshmen - battle weight gain
Author: Karen Uhlenhuth / Knight Ridder Newspapers
Karen Uhlenhuth
&nbsp;
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  - There's one part of the freshman curriculum that McKenzie Tyrrell is determined to skip.

That would be the Freshman 15, the zipper-straining weight gain that, according to conventional wisdom, accompanies a student's first year away from home when she or he is surrounded by the temptations and stresses of college life.

Tyrrell started hearing and worrying about becoming a chubby college coed back when she was a high school senior in Boulder, Colo. The older girls would return home from college with, if not visibly larger posteriors, chilling tales of tighter pants.

"They were talking about how it's something that's going to happen," said Tyrrell, a freshman at the University of Kansas. "They were saying it's hard to prevent because of the all-you-can-eat whenever you want (dormitory food) and the partying."

Tyrrell, for one, is taking preventive action. She works out almost every day ... OK, since she's gotten "off track" it's really been more like three days a week.

But at her all-you-can-eat dormitory cafeteria, she tries to keep her portions reasonable. And as for pizza and beer, she hardly ever ... well, she does occasionally join her dorm-mates in a gooey cheese-covered late-night snack. But she hardly ever washes it down with a cold brew.

Given the potent combination of bountiful eats, lots of pressure, plenty of food-focused socializing and an absence of parental limits, Tyrrell said, "I can totally see this happening."

It happened to Julie Carey, a junior from Springfield, Mo. She shed 20 pounds in her last year of high school. They returned during her freshman year at KU.

"It wasn't something I worried about," she said, finishing dinner with her usual dining companions, three sophomore friends. "Some women are really concerned. Being overweight anyway, I wasn't concerned with my body image."

Socializing and easy-access dormitory food are a set-up for weight gain, Carey found. Even if she'd already eaten lunch, for example, Carey might consent to accompany her roommate to the cafeteria. And while she was there, it seemed she might as well pick up a bowl of ice cream so her friend wouldn't eat alone.

"That's the only time a lot of us have to talk," Carey said. "Otherwise I'm busy with meetings and homework."

When she eats alone, she said, "I grab a sandwich and leave. I don't stick around for ice cream."

It's hard to say just how many students pack on the pounds. The third- or fourth-year student who has gained 20 pounds since the start of freshman year "is a pretty common scenario," said Ann Chapman, a dietitian at KU's Watkins Memorial Health Center. She counsels students about eating issues. 

"One of the things that impresses me is how students let weight creep up on them ... 20 or even 40 pounds over two or four or five years. Some are shell-shocked they've gained that much."

Joe Donnelly, who directs KU's Center of Physical Activity and Weight Management, has studied eating and exercise habits among the school's students.

Although conventional wisdom targets freshmen as the weight gainers, Donnelly said a study he has conducted at KU suggests that it's the upperclassmen, not the freshmen, who are putting on the pounds. 

"As far as we can tell, it isn't 15. It's probably more like 5, or maybe 8," he said. Some students are still growing - taller, that is - and for them, weight gain isn't necessarily a health issue. But for those who are growing only thicker, Donnelly said, 5 or 8 pounds in a year or two "is quite a bit of weight." And it's often just the start.

College can be a fattening experience for some obvious reasons, Donnelly said.

"KU has food everywhere. Lunchrooms are all-you-can-eat. There are pockets of food all over campus. There's vendor stands in both unions. The new school of education, they immediately put in a cafe. These things are all over the place."

"My legs are definitely in shape. I walk literally everywhere," said Anjanee Reeves, who was dining with two other non-bus riders at Mrs. E's cafeteria, on Daisy Hill next to Lewis Hall. Reeves, a freshman from Kansas City, Kan., guessed she walks 40 minutes a day.

To get a better understanding of college weight gain, KU's Donnelly and Debra Sullivan, an associate professor in the department of dietetics and nutrition at the University of Kansas Medical School, have been watching what the students in Lawrence are eating. At KU, as among most adults, weight gain seems to be a greater concern among women than men.

One of their findings: Even students who buy a standard meal plan that provides on average 10 or 12 meals a week "typically eat 55 percent to 60 percent of their meals outside the cafeteria," Sullivan said. 

Compared to students from an earlier era, Sullivan said, "They seem to have more indiscriminate money and to eat outside the dorms. I paid for a meal plan, and I ate my meals there."

The timing of that discretionary food is part of the problem, Sullivan said .

"A significant chunk of the day's energy comes after 8 at night," she said. And that generally means one thing: pizza. Or maybe two: pizza plus beer.

"You're studying at night, and you're stressed or bored," Sullivan said. "And there is that socialization factor. You're not hungry, but somebody says, `Let's buy a pizza.'

Although the cafeteria invites students to make a sack lunch in the morning, few actually do that, Chapman said. "And many of them skip breakfast, so you lose that structure. Their eating becomes more erratic, there's more late-night eating, more fast food. And more alcohol."

"Undereating leads to overeating," Chapman said. "A lot of students get into a pattern of that. They're not eating breakfast because they want to sleep in. They grab something quick for lunch, and then they eat a huge dinner and feel terrible, both physically and emotionally. There's a lot of guilt associated with overeating, especially with females.

The program now encompasses snack foods in vending machines and at convenience stores on campus. 

That translates into baked instead of fried chips, granola bars instead of candy bars, and bags of seeds and nuts.

There are no data yet on the response to the healthier-food campaign, but Chapman said that may happen soon.

While they may make some impact, the best efforts of the university's food service won't counter all of the forces driving college students to overeat.

Headline: Debate bursting out all over Iraq's university campuses
Author: Nancy A. Youssef / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
BAGHDAD, Iraq - Within the relatively safe confines of Baghdad's university campuses, a picture emerges of what democracy could look like throughout the country if worries about security hadn't trumped everything else.

It's not pretty. Indeed, it's messy, uneven and at times angry. Students and professors alike are still learning what democracy is and debating how to execute it on campuses - or whether universities are ready for such debates at all.

Like American universities, Iraqi campuses provide a haven for open political thought. The discussions are much more progressive than they are off the grounds, in large part because campuses are among the few places that aren't overburdened by security problems.

Students hold protests and sit-ins, sign petitions and go on marches, all new since Saddam Hussein fell. This week, a group of students from al Mustansiriya University protested Iraqi national guard officers using their dormitories, saying that space should be reserved for students. The debates are steeped in religion. Most universities have only two major political student associations: a Shiite Muslim one and a Sunni Muslim one. Each group from Iraq's historically rivalrous Islamic traditions is advocating a different style of university life, and how much religion should shape it.

Should women be forced to wear head scarves and should they be allowed to wear pants? Can students put up posters of their favorite candidates or would that offend others? Can a Shiite student be treated fairly at a school administrated by a Sunni president, and vice versa?

Politics has become so pervasive that the Higher Education Ministry has posted signs on all campuses that tell students their rights. Among them: "The freedom of opinion expression is a guaranteed right to the entire academic society, under the rule that this does not interfere with a student's education."

At Baghdad University, students are debating whether women should be forced to wear uniforms: long gray skirts and white shirts. Last year, students largely tossed out the idea of a uniform. But when the school year began earlier this month, it appeared to make a comeback.

At al Mustansiriya, women are forbidden from wearing pants on the grounds. Guards monitor those entering the main gate, and any woman in pants who attempts to enter will be required to leave.

Taki Ali al Moosawi, the chancellor of al Mustansiriya, said the ban on trousers allowed students to focus on their studies.

Some at al Mustansiriya are assigning separate staircases for men and women, saying it's a democratic right not to have to share. Others are pushing for separate campuses for men and women.

"Our policy at the university is that there is no political or religious influence," al Moosawi said. "The university is here for teaching."

Sunni students disagree, saying the new rules are in place because the university wants to impose a stricter way of life, one that reflects al Moosawi's Shiite background.

"There are some problems between Sunni and Shiite groups," said Ahmed Nihaad, 21, a third-year computer science student who's Sunni. "They are very sectarian. The nationalistic feeling has disappeared."

On the other side of the city, at al Nahrain University, the president is Sunni. Shiite students said they had to form an association to protect their interests. They call their group al Quafar, named after a verse in the Quran. Their counterparts are called Youth and Students.

"We feel the university president is the reason the level of education has gone down." Ahmed Faras, 25, a graduate chemistry student.

Headline: Returning soldiers struggle to resume campus life
Author: Aamer Madhani / Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. - Lying on the hood of the Humvee he used as his bed for much of the war, Brandon Nordhoff would put on his earphones, turn up the volume on his Discman to drown out battlefield noises, and imagine himself at a party back on the Indiana University campus.

After one such dream, Nordhoff determined when he returned to campus, he would pledge a fraternity and make up for the social life he lost while deployed with his Indianapolis-based Marine reserve unit.

He has made up for lost time with his social life, but for Nordhoff and many of the thousands of Iraq war veterans, the transition from war zone to campus has not gone smoothly. They acknowledge they struggle to mend war wounds, mental and physical, while trying to readjust to the relative triviality of life as a student.

As the oldest pledge in this year's Acacia fraternity class, Nordhoff, 21, often feels awkward. Partying while many of his Marine buddies are still in Iraq now seems frivolous. And the occasional war protest on campus can make him furious.

"Going to war changes you," said the corporal, a junior from Kirksville, Ind., a small farming community near Bloomington. "I feel 200 percent different than the people in Bloomington and a lot of the kids at the university."

In the first few weeks of the school year, Veterans Affairs officers at campuses throughout the Midwest have reported being inundated with soldier-students looking for help collecting their education benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill.

The officers can help them straighten out their benefits, but universities have no one designated to help the soldiers with the transition from battlefield to classroom.

Although the Iraq war has not generated the unrest on campuses the Vietnam War brought in the 1960s and 1970s, divided opinion on the current conflict is obvious. Some returning soldiers complain their classmates and professors often have a shallow view of the war and they do not show enough support for the troops.

"Inevitably in classes, you have these kids who criticize the war and criticize the president and don't know what they're talking about," said Cpl. Daniel Rhodes, a Marine reservist from La Grange, Ill., and a senior in political science at the University of Illinois in Champaign. "I want to say to them, `Do you realize that you're sitting here in a classroom, living freely, because we're willing to fight?'"

Other veterans have returned to campus with doubts about the necessity of the war in Iraq. From lectures in his Chinese history class about how emperors sold war to their people, to a local business' toy-soldier display representing Americans who have died in combat, Bradley Rehak, a senior at the University of Iowa, said he is constantly reminded of the war.

"We can say that we got rid of a terrible dictator by going to war," said Rehak, 24, a medic with the Iowa National Guard. "The argument misses the far greater points that we haven't found that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and we haven't found links between al-Qaida and Iraq."

INTERNATIONAL

Arafat exit would leave Mideast at crossroads

According to Palestinian political analysts, the long-term incapacitation or death of Yasser Arafat, 75, who was flown to Paris on Friday for treatment of an undiagnosed illness, would mean Palestinians  would have to cope for the first time with the absence of a leader who has for decades concentrated the power of his country in his own hands.

Without Arafat, new pressures could mount on Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to resume peace negotiations, possibly by undercutting the rationale for his policy of unilateral disengagement. Sharon's oft-stated assertion that Arafat is no partner for peace lies behind his decision to withdraw Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip and erect a barrier separating Israelis from Palestinians.

The U.S. administration might also now show greater interest in Middle Eastern diplomacy. For the past four years, President Bush has shunned Arafat.

As they have in the past, Palestinian leaders are confronting the prospect of who would replace Arafat.

Many expect that Arafat's titles- President of the Palestinian Authority, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, Chairman of the Fatah Revolutionary Committee and Chairman of the Fatah Central Committee- will be divided.

OTHER UNIVERSITIES

Fewer black students choose state universities


From Georgia to California and throughout the Midwest, the number of black freshmen on state college campuses has declined, in some cases by hundreds, puzzling admissions officers and university officials. Comprehensive statistics on minority enrollment for the year have not been gathered, but a survey of a dozen major universities reveals a troubling trend: fewer black freshmen and no explanation, despite record numbers of high school graduates.

The University of Michigan, the subject of a fiercely contested U.S. Supreme Court case on affirmative action that may have discouraged potential applicants, enrolled 350 African-American freshmen this fall, down 60 from last year.

This year, African-Americans enrolled at the University of Georgia dropped by 26 percent.  Ohio State enrollment declined by 157 first-year black students, or 29 percent. The University of Wisconsin at Madison was down by eight students.

Not all state schools saw declines. Indiana University in Bloomington registered an increase of 106 black freshmen, a 36 percent jump, and the University of Illinois at Chicago enrolled 18 more than last year, according to admissions officers.

Some private schools also recording strong increases. Northwestern University enrolled 109 African-American freshmen, the highest number in four years.

The University of Chicago welcomed 55 black freshmen, one short of last year's record of 56.

Education experts say it's too early to determine what's behind the apparent shift, but they say that because of the steady increase in African-American high school graduates, the explanation cannot be found in demographics.

Headline: Shopping spree promotes Breezeway's new hours
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Breezeway Café, at the University Park residential quad, has been sponsoring a contest since Oct. 18 to promote the store's extended weekday hours.

"[The reason why we're having this contest is because] we're trying to advertise," said Carlos Palomino, assistant manager of the store. "We're trying to let people know that the Breezeway  is now open until 2 a.m. on weeknights."

The concept of the contest is simple enough: Members of the housing community who visit the Breezeway can register for the contest by filling out a short form available at the cash register between 12 a.m. and 2 a.m., Monday through Thursday, Oct. 18 to Nov. 9.

On Nov. 10, a prominent member of the Housing Community will randomly draw a winner from one of the registration forms. 

The winner will then be given 15 seconds to grab as many items as he can carry from around the store. As a prize, he will get to keep whatever he collects.

All members of the housing community, whether they are students, employees or teachers are allowed to participate. The only exception to this rule is employees of the Breezeway Café; they are prohibited from entering.

Housing residents are hearing about the contest in many different ways. Some have seen the sign at the checkout counter of the Breezeway. Others, like senior Courtney Capoano, heard about it from their roommates.

"My roommate, Alli, saw a flyer in an Everglades hallway and told me I should enter," she said. "I'm excited. I don't know what my chances [of winning] are, but I have hope. It's like "Supermarket Sweep" and that show is awesome." 

The contest is being sponsored by the Fresh Food Company.

Headline: Ramadan Fast-a-Thon encourages charity
Author: Katherine Beale / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Adel Elsayed, a sophomore and biomedical engineering student, hadn't eaten since dawn. Yet he didn't touch the plate of cookies his 2 p.m. class passed around.

Elsayed, a Muslim student, will not eat anything during the daylight hours of Ramadan, the month of purification  from Oct. through Nov. Instead, he said he will feed himself spiritually by praying, reading the Koran -Islam's holiest book- and trying to keep his mind and actions free from lust and negativity.

"What I get out of Ramadan is discipline," he said. He added with laughter that watching other people eat in front of you requires even more discipline.

For the estimated one billion Muslims in the world, fasting during Ramadan is an essential part of Islam. As one of the five pillars (or required duties) of their religion, fasting is proudly observed by able Muslims as an act of faith and empathy.

In an effort to keep up with this tradition, FIU's Muslim community invited students to join them on Nov. 1 for an entire day of fasting. 

The Muslim Student Association coordinated the third annual Ramadan Fast-a-Thon to benefit the Daily Bread Food Bank. For every non-Muslim student who agreed to go without food and drink from 5:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., a local business donated $1 to Daily Bread. In the end, over $650 was raised.

MSA President Lora Kajan, a junior and international business major, was pleased that many non-Muslims participated. 

"Besides the charity...it makes you appreciate that you have a lot more, because once you go without food for a whole day, you really appreciate the privilege of eating," she said.

The Fast-a-Thon also gave students an opportunity to see what their Muslim friends  experience during the month of Ramadan.

"It's a very rewarding experience," Kajan said. "They step into our shoes for the day...It's not easy what they're doing, and we appreciate that."

An estimated 33 million Americans are living without enough to eat, according to the National Student Campaign against Hunger and Homelessness. 

The Ramadan Fast-a-Thon is one way for students to help those people. Around 300 participants signed a pledge-sheet promising to abstain from food and drink and to try not to think any negative thoughts.

Kajan described the renewed gratitude students have for food once they have fasted. 

"When you buy something [to eat], you [might] eat just a little bit of it and then throw it away. Then when you're fasting, you think, 'Oh, if only I had that now.'" She says that when she gets hungry during fasting, she puts her discomfort into perspective by remembering that  she is fasting for only a month while there are others who constantly go without food.

At the end of the day, 125 of the students who  pledged their time joined FIU's Muslim community for a meal in GC 243. 

The Muslim students began the event with a group prayer, eating a date as a sign that the fast had ended. 

At the end of the meal, they showed a movie to educate non-Muslims about the history and importance of Ramadan in the Islamic community.

Headline: Leftover candy can be baked into anything from breakfast to dessert
Author: Jill Wendholt Silva / Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
Candy is dandy - until after Halloween.

As you stare down the pile of Fun Size candy bars rising in a mound from the kitchen table, you, a frugal cook, begin to wonder how to tackle the kids' trick-or-treat largesse.

Our advice: Bake it.

Using candy as a baking ingredient isn't a new idea, of course. Where would kindergarten room mothers be without the standard-issue M&M cookies?

Or a popular chain restaurant without a decadent Snickers cheesecake? But to get a sense of just how candy cuisine has captured the popular imagination, just cruise on over to www.cooks.com, where you'll find no fewer than 97 recipe variations for the toffee-flavored Heath Bar.

"It's something fun, and it's something to do with all those candy bars you get from fund-raisers. I don't like to be wasteful," says Patti Alderson of Buckner, Mo., who has a collection of candy recipes she makes all year.

Alderson makes cookies and fudge using candy bars. Her husband pours melted Cherry Mash candy bars over ice cream to create a sweet sundae. 

And now she's handing down the melted candy tradition to her grandsons, Troy, 9, and William, 4.

For Christmas, Alderson crushes peppermint candies with a rolling pin and rolls balls of fudge through the sprinkles. 

When she makes chocolate chip cookies, she often substitutes an equal amount of crushed or chunked candy bars for the chocolate chips. 

Oatmeal-raisin cookies get a flavor boost with the addition of mini Hershey bars with almonds. She also stirs chopped Hershey kisses into Rice Krispy Treats.

At www.recipegoldmine.com, you can delve into variations on a cheesecake theme with flavors including Heath Bar, Junior Mint and Tootsie Roll. Imagine an early morning encounter with Candy Bar French Toast available at www.mrbreakfast.com. 

And at www.thatsmyhome.com, Snickers chunks are the main ingredient for an, ahem, "salad" recipe featuring apples chunks, Cool Whip, sour cream and peanuts.

"The Candy Bar Cookbook" (Longstreet Press, 2000) by children's author Alison Inches and pastry chef Ric McKown takes candy bar cookery to a new level with such tempting morsels as Bit-O-Honey Pumpkin Cake, Milky Way Pain au Chocolat (which could definitely work for breakfast) and Dots Tartlets.

But perhaps the most offbeat recipes appear in the "Sticky Fingers" section featuring recipes especially for children. 

They include Circus Peanuts Cereal (we're not making this up!), Pigs in Blankets (Tootsie Rolls wrapped in Fruit Roll-Ups), Pop Rocks Crisp Rice Bars and Shortbread Pizza with Candy Toppings ("One cookie pizza to go Hold the Swedish Fish").

The National Confectioners Association, www.candyusa.org, offers these tips when cooking with candy:

Since candy is naturally sweet, be sure to cut back on the amount of sugar in the ingredient list.

Most baked goods with candy in them require a lower baking temperature and less time in the oven.

When using chocolate candy, be sure to mix pieces into the butter or dough to protect it from the direct heat of baking.

For frozen desserts, choose candies that don't freeze too hard, such as toffees and mints.

Unbaked candy products, such as candy canes, Necco wafers or Butterfinger shards, can be used to make dessert garnishes.

Melted candy bars make tasty dessert sauces and glazes.



	RECIPE

The following recipe is from "The Candy Bar Cookbook: Baking With America's Favorite Candy" (Longstreet Press, 2000) by Alison Inches and Ric McKown.

MILKY WAY PAIN AU CHOCOLAT

The Milky Way Bar was invented in 1923. It was the first candy bar with a fluffy nougat center.

Makes 4 servings



2 (2.5-ounce) Milky Way bars 

1 container refrigerated rolls

For the glaze: 

1 cup chocolate chips 

1 tablespoon milk 

1 tablespoon butter

For the pain au chocolate: 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and spray a cookie sheet with nonstick spray.

Chop the candy bars into 1-inch slices.

Break open the crescent roll container. The dough will be in 2 halves. Unroll dough and divide on the middle partition, taking care not to tear the diagonal perforations. 

There will be 4 rectangles of dough.

Place all 4 rectangles of dough on the cookie sheet with the narrower edges toward you.

Sprinkle 1 cup of chopped candy bars on top of each rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border on both sides and a 1-inch border on the end furthest from you.

Roll up the dough like a sleeping bag, beginning with the edge closest to you. If the diagonal perforations tear when rolling, gently pinch them together.

Repeat with the remaining 3 rectangles.

Space the pains au chocolat 2 to 3 inches apart.

Bake 20 to 22 minutes, or until golden.

&nbsp;
Turns out Avril Lavigne isn't just an inscrutable pop Smurf. The singer, in the midst of a North American tour, is also a modern-day pioneer for Canada.

The extraordinary success of the 20-year-old sk8er girl from tiny Napanee, Ontario, opened the borders for a raft of precocious female talent from up north, including Fefe Dobson, 19, Skye Sweetnam, 16, and Keshia Chante, 16.

Actually, Chante hasn't managed to cross over with the rest. Though the impressive young soul singer from Ottawa may well be the most talented of the bunch _ she ran the table at the Canadian Urban Music Awards two weeks ago, she is the only one who hasn't landed on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, the only one who hasn't been on MTV's video countdown, "TRL," or featured on AOL's influential music programming.

She is, most tellingly, the only one of the four signed to a Canadian, rather than U.S., record label.

The disproportionate musical influence of the U.S. recording industry makes it difficult for purely Canadian acts to turn a profit, says Jennifer Hyland, artist-and-repertoire manager for Chante's label, BMG Canada.

"Even if we're platinum in Canada (100,000 units sold), it doesn't mean we're recovering the money we spent," Hyland says. "We need the international sales to start making money. And the first question they ask when we pitch an artist to Germany or Australia is, `What is the U.S. doing with it?'"

Our northern neighbor is not only less populous _ 32 million compared with 295 million here _ its musical tastes are unusually balkanized. 

Nova Scotia and other eastern provinces nurture a distinctive, rather rural, often fiddle-based folk music. Quebec fiercely maintains its Gallic identity.

"After last year's `Canadian Idol,'" Hyland says, "we signed the winner and the fourth runner-up who spoke no English at all, only French."

Tipping the trade imbalance even further is the cultural hegemony we enjoy over Canada.

"The media in Canada, 80 percent are American _ the fashion magazines, the TV, and teen magazines, all of it," Hyland says. "Even Much Music, our music channel, is importing (MTV's) `Newlyweds' and `Making the Band.'"

Radio gives Canadian artists their only home-field advantage with a rule that at least 40 percent of all music played must be homegrown.

As a consequence, Canadian musicians, from the time of their first talent showcases, are eager to attract the attention of U.S. labels.

Ken Krongard, the music executive who discovered Lavigne for the Arista label, recalls the mindset of her first manager.

"Cliff (Fabri) was all about the American labels," Krongard notes. " ... The deals are much bigger and the (promotional) power of the American labels is far superior. They can break artists on a worldwide level. There aren't many Canadian artists signed to Canadian labels who have broken worldwide."

Without Arista's influence, Lavigne's bratty-punk 2002 debut, "Let Go," would not have sold 14 million copies. The young singers in her wake may not reach such sales heights, but thanks to her, it's cool to be Canadian. 

Back in 2000, Krongard was one of few Americans actively scouting for talent in Canada.

"I wanted to look in virgin territory and Canada was being undersearched," he says. "People were intimidated to travel to what they perceived as overseas, but it's a short flight to Toronto and they speak English."

Still, it took a discerning ear. When he first heard Lavigne, she was a raw 15-year-old, warbling her way through a derivative brand of country karaoke.

"A lot of young Canadian singers come from the country scene," Krongard says. "It's the only place for them to perform and hone their skills."

With her latest album, "Under My Skin," Lavigne's style has evolved into to a sophisticated and personal brand of power pop. Curiously, though, her next single, due Nov. 9, is the theme song from the "SpongeBob SquarePants" movie.

At this point, all four artists have had a chance to experience life on both sides of the border, especially the pop-oriented Sweetnam, who traded places with a teenager in Lexington, Ky., for a week for the ABC Family series "Switched!" 

"It's totally different down there," Sweetnam says from her home in Bolton, Ontario. "Everything revolves around the school and the cheerleaders. Up here, everything is hanging out and chilling. A lot of our activities are outside school."

All remark on the more relaxed pace and civility of their native country.

"In Canada, people on the streets seem to talk to each other and hold the door open for one another," Lavigne says via e-mail. "They'll even say hi to strangers on the sidewalk. It's more laid-back than America."

Yet, all are vigilant for any signs of their own Canadian provincialism.

"I call beenies `toques' and I call soda `pop,'" Lavigne says. "In fact, I can't use the words `beenie' or `soda' because they're just too weird for me."

Sweetnam recalls: "When I was recording (the song) `Tangled Up in Me,' there's a lyric that goes, `Do you want to know more/More about me?' And the producer stopped me and said, `You went a little too Canadian on that line.'" In other words, "about" came out as "aboot."

Accents aside, what is most noticeable about this freshet of talent from the north is its diversity.

"My mom is white," she says on the phone as she is being driven to an appearance in Montreal. "She's Canadian, (native) Indian and Irish. My dad is black. He's Jamaican and Asian. I think of myself as a rainbow child."

"Canada is at a crossroads right now," says Rebecca Sullivan, an assistant professor of communications at the University of Calgary. "What's great about this emerging group of female artists is it shows that Canada is finally growing up and recognizing itself as an urban nation with many subcultures coexisting in large cities."

Headline: Members of Nonpoint reveal passion through lyrics
Author: Chris Whitfield / Contributing Wrtier
&nbsp;
With awe inspiring lyrics meant to unearth the inner rage of every head bouncing fan, the Fort Lauderdale based band Nonpoint achieves a higher level of respect on their new album, Recoil. Released August 3rd, Recoil marks a new era for them as they team up with Lava Records of the Warner Music Group. The powerful melodies of Nonpoint have been felt throughout the hard rock hierarchy, enabling them to hold their heads up high along side the likes of Linkin Park, The Deftones, Disturbed, Mudvayne, GlassJaw, Sevendust and others. 

If you have not seen Nonpoint in concert, you will be deafly pleased. As they build a reputation as one of the most thrilling live events on tour today, Nonpoint combines supreme guitar melodies with lyrics of truth. With recent appearances at Ozzfest in the U.S. and Great Britain, they are here to stay, adding to the depth of genuine, aggressive rock. 

Nonpoint's single "Truth" relates directly to the war in Iraq. With criticism pulsating in every phrase, this song challenges the U.S. government's involvement in Iraq without crossing the thin line into anarchist blabber. 

The band took 12 months to capture their thoughts on a new album after their first two sold over 300,000 copies. With one year dedicated to this album, it is no wonder that Recoil can harness all that emotion, providing the release we've all been waiting for. 

The lead vocalist Elias Soriano and drummer Robb Rivera explored their Spanish roots "Rabia" or "Rage." This song is entirely in Spanish, yet it succeeds. Even the "no speaka español" fans admire and understand its angry tone. The track "In the Air Tonight" is a take on the classic Phil Collins song of the same title. With Nonpoint's unique spirit, they manage to create their own song while maintaining a sense of respect for the original. "Wait" banks in as my personal favorite with addicting vocal melodies. 

You will find yourself overcome by Andrew Goldman's enchanting guitar work as you catch yourself selecting repeat on your CD player. "Past It All" reflects  on the hardships of relationships with touching lyrics like, "This wasn't what you said it would be when I got there / and when I got there they didn't even recognize me." 

Recoil shows elements of love and sorrow behind all the rage, providing a balance of emotion throughout the entire album. 

 With twelve beautifully crafted songs, it combines powerful lyrics with melodic guitar work creating an emotional roller coaster that confirms Nonpoint as a mainstay in the rock community.

Headline: The art of ink
Author: JARROD MILLER-DEAN / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
South Beach is known for its beach, heavy tourism, and never ending link of clubs, gyms and bars.  On the side of  14th and Collins, a small shop sticks out from the rest.  

A large-chested mermaid riding an eagle soars across the wall next to the entrance, while a ghoulish character circa Rat Fink, holds a sign reading, "18 or older only."  

As you walk into the basement-sized shop, miniature posters, drawings and designs crawl upon the walls.  Farther in the room, a tattooing area of four sectioned stalls, equipped with reclining dentist chairs and diamond plated swinging doors is reminiscent of a surgical nightmare. 

A heavily tattooed artist with a sinister grin seems to say, "This will only hurt a little bit," slowly draws on the skin with the dreaded ink gun. 

The miniature pistol-shaped device buzzes along the skin like a swarm of bees as clients lie helplessly squirming in the chair, like insects under a magnifying glass. 

With a charismatic crew of talented tattoo artists and piercers, Tattoos by Lou isn't your average tattoos parlor - it's a part of Miami's history. 

Notoriously known as "Miami's Original Tattoo," the shop was opened by renowned tattoo artist Lou Sciberras in the late 1980s. His technique of bold lines and solid colors put the little shop on the map, eventually growing to four different locations throughout the Miami area.

Though the shop is unlimited in its style and art, some customers tend to prefer clichéd images: tribal bands, zodiac signs or Japanese calligraphy. Others come in for more meaningful works like tattoos paying respect to a deceased loved one. 

"Tattoos are addictive. I get one every time I break up with a guy," piercer Kendra said.

 The more serious clientele have their pieces worked on in sessions. This is when a piece is so large or detailed that to work on it for more than a few hours at a time would be too much for the artist and, especially, the client. 

The sacred style of Maori, indigenous to New Zealand and Easter Island is one of many tattoo techniques. Originally bones were used to mark young warriors as a sign of manhood or life experience. An artist must know what each symbol means and where it must be placed on the body. It is not an easy process, being very rigorous and detailed.  

This is one of many things that sets Lou's apart from the average shop. Each artist has several years' experience, specializing in various areas with their own style. 

One artist's skull and crossbones can look extremely different from another's.  Many artists sell their flash work (drawings), resulting in similar tattoos for sale in different in shops.  

"Tattoo artists are a tightly knit society.  We look down on 'scratchers' (non-professionals that do work out of the home).  It's a bad representation of tattooing as an art form," artist Matt said.

If a person wants to become an artist, they have to take on an apprenticeship. The rigorous training can last anywhere from three to five years before they even touch another person with the ink gun.  They must know the proper procedures for designing flash, free-hand (drawing freehand on the skin), sterilization, and the gun. 

If the tattooer goes too deep, it can cause serious damage. 

Another thing that is discouraged is getting tattoos on the hands or feet. Both parts of the body are very active and sweat glands won't allow the ink to hold. Lou's also refuses to do work on the face or neck.

"It's a moral thing.  Most employers won't hire a person with visible ink," Jorgie, the store manager, said.

When getting a tattoo, customers are encouraged to either know what they want ahead of time, or to come to the shop and discuss a piece with an artist. After all, it will be with you for a lifetime, so make sure that you really want it.  

Although Lou Sciberras is no longer with us, his vision and work will live on in the heart of Miami.  

When you get a tattoo or piercing at Lou's, you don't just leave a walking road map or a human pincushion, you're walking away with a piece of a legend.

Call or visit Tattoos by Lou at one of their four locations in North Miami, Kendall, Hialeah and South Beach. Or visit their website: www.tattoosbylou.com.
