Headline: Photographers dedicate lives to work, each other
Author: Jessica Señorin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
From having to share one camera in high school to having their work exhibited in the United States and other countries such as Japan, Eduardo del Valle and Mirta Gómez never worried about their future as photographers.

"We never think of it in those terms. We never get enough. Right now we're still learning," del Valle said.

As associate professors of art and photography at FIU, del Valle and Gómez involve each other in every aspect of their lives. 

The couple have been married 37 years, worked together within the photography profession for 35 years, and taught classes together at FIU for the past 24 years.

According to del Valle, working together was not something that he and Gómez had initially planned. 

"It just sort of happened because when we first began photography, we were sharing one camera. So at one point, the pictures were so much the same that we couldn't tell who made what. And that's how it started. We didn't even know it was a collaboration," del Valle said.

When the couple realized they couldn't distinguish who did what in their photographs, they began to request to have both their names attributed to their work.

This later led them to agree to a collaboration, something del Valle believed was a good start.

They have had their work exhibited in several permanent collections, among them the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the New Orleans Museum of Art in Louisiana and the Hemphill Fine Arts museum in Washington, D.C.

Gómez said their work ethic has also integrated into their teaching style.

"It gets to the point where the students don't even ask [why they have two teachers]. It's so seamless," she said.

Born in Cuba, the couple eventually moved to the United States when they were children. 

Although they did not meet until high school, both del Valle and Gómez dealt with language barriers by communicating through visual means.

"[People] communicate verbally. That's the main focus of getting your message across and understanding things ... Then your main mode of communication and understanding a new culture becomes something else. In our case, it was visuals," Gómez said.

They both agree that working with beginning photography students is one of their biggest challenges and greatest rewards.

"They are the best because they have nothing to unlearn. [They] shoot something without even thinking about it. Most students have never really operated a piece of equipment thinking they're going to make art. It's very rewarding," Gómez said.

Del Valle and Gómez have received many grants in order to publish their work.

Some of these fellowships have come from the Oscar B. Cintas Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship.

One of the main goals del Valle and Gómez have is to publish their photography because, "books have a lasting effect that future generations can learn from," according to Gomez.

Del Valle said it's important for any professor to publish books in order to use their experience to better teach and engage their students.

"As a professor, if you don't do your research, if you don't exhibit work, if you don't publish work, then how can you translate that information to students if you're not transmitting something that you preach or something that you do?" he said.

The couple provides all the photographs, while different writers provide the text for the books.

The couple has three previous books all published by the Nazraeli Press.

The photographs in their book Between Runs (2006) were taken in Dongguan, China, while they were overseeing the production of their book Fried Waters (2005), and where most printing houses are located.

Between Runs is comprised of photographs  taken at the Hing Yip printing plant in Dongguan, during the couple's artistic "down time," or the time when a book is on press, between the approval of one printing form and the time when the artist is waiting to see the next printing form. 

"Every photographer's dream or fantasy is to go to press and see your book ... becasue you're in control of any change that occurs," del Valle said.

The couple's upcoming monograph, On View, will be out next year. It documents the transformation of the human body after death. Photographs will also be taken in the Yucat&aacute;n.

"Life, like photography, [is] very intuitive. You always learn. What you think you're going to see this way, it turns out to be the other way," del Valle. "We put our bodies in a situation where we know it would be interesting to work. But then once you're there, you look through a viewfinder, [and] things are always different than what you see in a three-dimensional world."

Locally, the couple's work from their four books can be viewed in an exhibition at the Chelsea Galleria Wynwood, located at 2441 NW Second Ave. in Miami.

The exhibition continues through April 7 in recognition of the 44th National Conference of the Society for Photographic Education.

"We teach to learn. [As professors] you have to be a working and engaged artist. You have to be interested and passionate in your own work. Otherwise, what good are you to your students? How do you feel their passion?" Gómez said.

Headline: Student braves cold weather, nagging mom to protest war
Author: Alexandra McAnarney / Sttaff Writer
&nbsp;
The trip starts with a Quarter Pounder.

In an unexpected and grotesque turn, McDonalds sullied my lips for the first time in three years on the night of March 15. 

Not feeling justified at propagating the corporate burger mill because I was going to Washington, D.C., for four days, the grease went down hard and the milkshake hit my nervous system like china white, just as pure and twice as devastating.

But the guilt hit as I mourned my clogged arteries sitting on the D.C. Green Line subway shooting to Columbia Heights on Friday morning. Besides, there are worse things than biting into a stale, grey, meat patty after a three-year pause - like cultural and political apathy.

The subway walls kept the freezing waters at bay.

I guess that's what experiences feel like: a 50-foot wall of water crashing upon you, purifying you yet leaving you frozen and half-dead right where you stand. 

I haven't shared that small observation with my traveling companions: organizer Muhammed Malik, president of Act Now to Stop War and FIU's chapter of End Racism- and also my boyfriend and liaison to ANSWER Washington D.C., as well as Greta Martinez, photographer and international relations major.

The journey to come to Washington, D.C., had been an odyssey in itself. 

It had begun with an intense amount of lobbying in front of the student government association at the Biscayne Bay Campus asking them to please sponsor the trip around December. Our argumenet was that we are a student organization interested in taking its members on a worthwhile experience to a Iraq War protest, 40 years after the Pentagon March 1967, where thousands protested the war in Vietnam.

Tempers ran high at the FIU ANSWER chapter, forms got trashed after months of bureaucratic nonsense and in the end, only three of us remained but we were still only getting $120 per person. 

That didn't even cover the entirety of the plane ticket. Thank God for my stash of frequent flyer miles. But after that cleared, I was still budgeting myself at $380 for food, transportation and our hostel.

There was also the matter of my overprotective, very Catholic mother.

Born and raised in El Salvador, the fact that I was traveling with my boyfriend, regardless of the other Salvadorian girl traveling with me, made her bless herself twice.

We tend to guilt-trip very well as Catholics.But I was finally in D.C. and out the plane when guilt slapped me in the form of a wind chill factor of 20 degrees.

Guilt over a cheeseburger, my angst-ridden mother and the money I had spent so far - considering the state of my finances, it was serious.

I pretty much left the guilt at the doorstep of the Washington International Students Hostel, my home for our four-day extravaganza.

We had walked an hour in sleet and slush to get there after the subway because we wanted to see the sights.

We were spoiled Miamians without an inkling of cold weather. More whining ensued when it reached 30 degrees on Friday night, and after the initial "oohing" and "aahing" at the cold white powder flurrying around our shivering bodies in the middle of Chinatown, we said "[Expletive] that!" and crammed ourselves into an Audi, speeding off, looking for a warmer place.

While trying to stay warm, I began to wonder how many people there actually knew where Iraq was.

I tossed around these thoughts in my head while listening to Melinda Arredondo speak about her deceased stepson Alexander Scott Arredondo.

"I paid for his dental, his health, his school," she spoke, her voice breaking in a fit of maternal anguish and militant passion. "He was my son, I was there with him and now he is dead."

Behind her, the conservative contingent composed mostly of leather jacket clad men of the "incredibly religious southern persuasion" armed itself for a counter protest supporting the war. 

The march began in front of the Lincoln Memorial and ended at the Pentagon. The lead banner of the march, "U.S. Out of Iraq Now," was carried by Cindy Sheehan, peace activist and mother of a fallen soldier and Cynthia McKinney among others involved in the anti-war protest.

The walk took about 30 minutes across Memorial Bridge and kept our blood running in the slicing cold. Greta stopped to take pictures along the way, while Muhammed and I walked at the very front. Ramsey Clarke, former U.S. attorney general under former president Lyndon B. Johnson, and one of the founders of ANSWER National Chapter were our walking partners. 

At the Pentagon, marchers rallied in the parking lot; we weren't allowed to get any closer. We saw Pentagon Riot Squads advancing on protesters loitering on the hill, wanting to get closer to the ultimate bastion of military intelligence. Fortunately, no tear gas flew and no blows were dealt.

It was warmest in the crowd. Posters stuck in sharp contrast against the sky with the occasional papier mache Bush head on a spike. Some kids from FIU's Bolivarian Youth served as security between the stage and the crowd. We had started our day at 11:30 a.m., some even earlier. It was now 4:30 p.m. It felt good, empowering and manic.

Our motley protest was sprinkled by Palestian Kefiahs, pin splattered jackets, Iraq war and Vietnam veterans, mothers,  ex-politicians, a man who looked suspiciously like Woody Allen and these two hippies, one of which was wearing a fishnet shirt but didn't even shiver while he played his banjo in the middle of a field. In the end, our numbers ranged from 10,000 to 20,000. It would have been more, but due to weather, many supporters were stuck on buses and delayed flights.

We by no means expected to end the war at that very moment. 

Still, we exerted a basic right in voicing our contempt when things have taken an Orwellian turn and saying "bomb" or "terrorist" on the phone can put you at risk.

Headline: New club represents gay students
Author: Paula Acuña / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
History, information and sociability are the three main characteristics that describe Stonewall 2, according to Daniel Anzueto, its president and sophomore majoring in psychology.

The club for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning students, known as the LGBTQ community, meets every Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. in the Wolfe University Center, room 141, which is the Campus Life office conference room. 

Currently, the club has 10 regular members.   

The new club's purpose is to reach the gay community in the Biscayne Bay Campus, but is also open to all students who are allies or friends and are not part of the homosexual community. 

"Three of the five members of the board are not gay or lesbian, they are just friends who support us; they are allies," Anzueto said.

The club held an informational campaign March 27 and 28 named "LGBTQ One on One Housing Education." Its aim was to educate students at Bay Vista housing about the lifestyle of the LGBTQ community.

Anzueto said that other projects of the club involve participation in the Pride Fest by the end of March and raising funds for the AIDS walk by the end of April.

The club at BBC is connected to Stonewall Pride Alliance, the club at University Park created in 2002.

Michelle Gonzalez, the club's vice president and a junior majoring in humanities, hopes both clubs can have joint activities.

 "We are planning a get together at the bay with the two Stonewall clubs.  We are expecting more people to get motivated to come after this activity," Gonzalez said.  

Anzueto agreed.

"The idea is not to make people choose between the UP club and the BBC club, but to do things together," said Anzueto.

  According to Gonzalez, both clubs share the same webpage, which is www.fiu.edu/~spridea. Stonewall 2 also has a group on Facebook and on MySpace.

The name Stonewall comes from the name of a gay and lesbian bar in Greenwich Village, New York.

On June 28, 1969, the police went in the bar to arrest its patrons. A group stood against the police during that night and the riots continued for several nights.

"[It] is an important place and historic event for the LGBTQ community," Anzueto said.

"The club is open not only for members of the LGBTQ community, but also for those who want equalities for everyone.  It's about LGBTQ awareness through community events like raising funds for the AIDS walk," Gonzalez said. 

However, Anzueto is expecting the club to grow, as "more students from the LGBTQ community start to come out and go to the meetings."

"I think people are not coming because we started the meetings by the end of the Spring semester, but I'm hoping to see more people coming during the summer," Gonzalez said.

The club has posted fliers around campus with the time and place where they meet, and is trying to spread the word through the LGBTQ community to recruit more people.

The meetings are informational and social.  They share news relevant to the LGBTQ community and discuss them.  They also review history, such as the meaning of the upside down pink pyramid, which is a gay symbol.

 "We dedicated the last meeting before Spring Break to plan our get together at the bay.  We had a great time," Gonzalez said.

According to Vicky Owles, the club's advisor and assistant director of Campus Life for BBC, the group has been "warmly welcomed by the administration."

This has been Anzueto's first time creating a club. He said he received support from Owles; A.J. Costa, a graduate assistant working on LGBTQ issues through MPAS at UP; and Kathy Akens, the assistant vice president of Student Affairs.

"We are different, yes, but we are still people, and we have a right to be represented by a club," Anzueto said.

Headline: Student Aesthetics: Honors College exhibit challenges art perception
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There are many different forms of art, ranging from the simple portraits and landscapes to the melding and warping of metal. Third year Honors College students have brought what some may consider a more controversial art to FIU with their "Aesthetics & Values 2007" exhibit under the direction of professor John Bailly.

The exhibit was unveiled on March 16, to the pleasure of its Honors College student curators, to challenge how people perceive art.

Located on the second floor of the Green Library, the exhibit features controversial artwork, including various nude photographs and other pieces that some may consider bizarre.

"The exhibit, to me, is an amazing accomplishment by our entire class," said curator Rocio Perez. "I'm not used to seeing nude women as soon as I walk into a library. But I love the meaning behind it."

During the initial phases, Honors College curators set out to find local artists willing to have their work on display at FIU, an arduous, but fulfilling task according to curators. By the time each piece was set up, student curators were completely responsible for the "Aesthetics & Values 2007" exhibit.

"It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside about the insights the Honors College [students] have certainly gained by dealing with Values and Aesthetics in such a direct way," said artist Bill Maguire.  

There was also a more graphic display by Samantha Salzinger. Salzinger's work, which became the defacto icon of the exhibit, consists of photographs of people undergoing plastic surgery as well as several nude photographs. When asked if she thought her work was too risqué, her reply was a simple "no."

"Confrontational, yes … too confrontational, maybe. But let's consider the fact that these women are cutting themselves up for the sake of beauty … and don't we see this all over the television anyhow?" Salzinger said. 

Other artists also consider the pieces displayed to be completely within the bounds of acceptability. 

"I do not feel that any work in the exhibition is too risqué," said artist Barry Sparkman. "One of the important functions of art is to challenge and expand the way that viewers see the world. None of the nudity is pointless or gratuitous."

"Aesthetics & Values 2007" will culminate with a reception April 4, where the exhibit curators will be explaining the meaning behind each piece of art. In addition, the actual artists of each work will be present. 

"[The artists being present] is great since a lot of the times you have no idea what the art really means," Perez said. 

The reception will be more like an opening night at a gallery, according to curators. It will begin at 5 p.m. in the Green Library in front of the exhibit and will last until 8 p.m. 

There will also be a special discussion with artist Xavier Cortada April 11 at 12:30 p.m. in the Deuxieme Maison building, room 100. During the panel, students will be able to have one-on-one time with Cortada to inquire about his artwork and art in general. The panel is open to the public. 

The "Aesthetics & Values 2007" exhibit will end April 18. Artists on display also include Carlos Betancourt, Clifton Childree, Julie Kahn, Clive King, Gretchen Scharnagl, Wendy Wischer and Carlos De Villasante.

Headline: My Life! Experience: Student reflects on trip to Ghana
Author: Cristela Guerra / BBC Editor
&nbsp;
As soon as I walked out of the plane and my feet touched the tarmac floor, Ghana became my home.

My feet still remember the hard red clay roads, picking up dust that stuck to all parts of my sandal. My eyes acknowledged the fruit trees surrounding large homes and the high, fortress-like walls. Even now I still dream of people's smiles and strangers' glances, especially those of the children.

While visiting the African country during Spring Break, I sensed their contentment, and I found that these people have a joy of living that seemed miraculous under some of the circumstances that they were in.

Yet, this happiness was rooted in the struggles they faced as a people; throughout their lives these experiences bring sorrow, giving birth to strength.   

I still feel the children's hands in mine as they showed me around their communities my first week in the city.  Their stories were sometimes the most heartbreaking and yet, their smiles were also the most honest.

Tales varied: some were runaways, leaving home at a young age because of abuse. They left to fend for themselves because it was just too much.  Many of the girls were sexually abused from the age of 10 and then made it their livelihood because otherwise they would starve.

The smaller ones looked like they just knew too much about the world - they were as young as 6 years-old.   

Our purpose in Accra was to meet their needs the best way we could.  Six individuals, including myself, were going to host a Vacation Bible School for some of these children at an orphanage called The Beautiful Gate. Pastor Ben Kote and his wife Beatrice began their mission in life with Ghana's street children because Ben felt it was his vocation, a true calling by God, to serve - to provide a place for them when no one else would.

My first night there, we had more than 100 kids running around, laughing and singing worship music. Lights were rare on the road, but I could see them waiting. Only so many children actually lived at the Center, while the rest would trickle in through the open gate. I felt nervous. What if they didn't like us?  What if they didn't have fun? Or worse, what if they didn't come back?

Yet, they did come back. Night after night they returned, according to Ben; some slept on the concrete floor of the pavilion to wait for us.

Our lesson for the week was to teach them love. Corinthians 13: "Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast…"

We emphasized God's love, not the pseudo love some might have given them, not the apathy and even anger they experience at home.

We showed them the true meaning of unconditional love through our actions, through our hugs and through our words.

Some weekend, the Center shuttled the children in from the streets in a van the Kotes would pay for.  Most weekends, they brought the kids to have a church service with them, feeding them and clothing them if they could.  

The children's faces soon became familiar to me - so did their hugs. There were so many kids that some had to sit on the floor while we had puppet shows because the pavilion was so small. I was in charge of games and always ended the night sweaty, dusty and smiling.

These kids became my heart, and at the end of every night, my hearts gathered themselves up hand in hand, some carrying their sibling to spend their night in their home, out on the street.

I find solace in the fact that for a few hours each night for a week, these faces of the street that no one glances at were finally able to be what they are - children.

Headline: Review: Tekken 5 (Game)
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Just as "Virtua Fighter" introduced 3-D fighting games into our culture, Namco's "Tekken" arrived to give competition to Sega's franchise in the arcades and home consoles. Both original games have been compared and contrasted many times by casual gamers and enthusiasts alike while competition continues to be as fierce as it was when both franchises began. Now, more than a decade later, "Tekken" is still running strong with its fifth incarnation, "Dark Resurrection," an inexpensive downloadable game for the PlayStation 3.

Sporting 36 characters, "Tekken 5: DR" offers lots of choices for players.  With new moves, characters and tweaks, "Tekken" is a more balanced and polished game than its predecessor.  The game's classic four-button control scheme (two punches and two kicks) still works very well and is very responsive. Although there is no training mode and the lists of moves and strategies for all the fighters can be daunting, the game is still very accessible to anyone willing to learn.

For the low price of $20 and some time to download, this is a great deal for a solid fighting game in the PS3's small library.

Despite being a straight port of the arcade version with no graphic enhancements from the PS3 hardware, the game's look has aged well. The new  versions of the old "Tekken" stages are nice and there are a few new places to fight in as well as the old stages. 

The fighters themselves look great and with many customizable items available, you are sure to find a look that fits you and your favorite character.

Some gamers might see this offering of "Tekken" as being limited in extras and such, but there is no denying that the real meat of the game is top-notch.  "Tekken 5: DR" continues the tradition of great fighting action for both newcomers and veterans and the low price point makes the deal even sweeter.

PlayStation Portable owners can also pick up the equally impressive portable version of the game for fighting on the go.

Headline: FIU Goes Green: New environmentally friendly buildings will lower energy costs
Author: Joy Clahar / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A few weeks ago, millions of people worldwide watched as former Vice President Al Gore's documentary film, An Inconvenient Truth, won two Oscars. The idea that the movie is trying to portray is that it's the responsibility of the individual to make a difference in the threat of global warming and things that have to do with the well being of our Earth.  

The world's environmental issues are only the big picture. Closer to home, there are concerns about the environment and its protection here at FIU.  

There are many discussing the prospect of making our campus more environmentally friendly by constructing new "green buildings" that are ecologically compatible. These buildings will have natural lighting and use non-toxic paint and carpeting.

Unfortunately, what inspired the creation of FIU's new Building and Environment Committee to consider this was probably not the noble heeding of a call to action to save the beloved Earth. It is the usual suspect: finances.  

The committee is intended to address the challenge of "increasing electricity costs," cited in the University's Millennium Strategic Planning report. 

With a budget of $2 million allocated for utilities in the 2005- 2006 school year, and 19 building projects planned as of Fall 2001.  This is an issue involving a lot more than loose change.

We shouldn't expect to see any solar paneled roofs or buildings out of sci-fi movies any time soon. That may be a bit too expensive.

Whatever their motivation, any effort to conserve energy, reduce pollutants and recycle building materials is a step in the right direction for the health of our planet and ourselves.  

Although finances may be a big motivation for this project, the fact that it will be very beneficial for the environment is the most important factor.

The fact is it doesn't take a lot of money to make a real difference in the efficient use of resources.  For example, FIU currently uses fluorescent bulbs, which use less electricity and are more cost effective. 

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, compact fluorescent bulbs use two-thirds less energy and last as much as 10 times longer than standard incandescent bulbs. They may also reduce cooling costs compared to other bulbs because they generate only 30 percent as much heat.

The fact that green buildings can be just as aesthetically pleasing as the already beautiful University Park campus is another plus. Students at the Biscayne Bay Campus can also rest assured that if these building techniques are applied to projects such as the Hospitality Management Expansion, they should be a positive addition to the natural appeal of the bay setting.

FIU can be given kudos for being more environmentally conscious when choosing building materials.

This may not only produce a substantial monetary benefit, but also have positive effects on the world around us.

Any way you look at it, it is in the students' best interest to support FIU in its efforts to cut costs by implementing cleaner, more efficient policies.  

As the school's expenses increase, student fees will undoubtedly rise accordingly. As it expands, we take in construction waste, safe or toxic, in our air and water.

Most importantly, thousands of years from now, even if the University system as we know it is obsolete, our children's children will still be able to enjoy the foundation and care on which it was built.

Headline: American culture lacks positive female role models
Author: Jose Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the rise of women to uncharted planes in the workforce and the gradual loosening of moral boundaries on women over the past few decades, there has been an overwhelming surge of positive change for women in American society.

However, in tandem with this new freedom, there has been a profound emphasis on sexuality, and women have seen themselves become portrayed as mere objects of lust in various mediums, including film, printed publications and television.

We have seen the emergence of a new breed of women: uninhibited party animals and flamboyantly sexual exhibitionists.

Stars such as Paris Hilton, Nicole Ritchie, Lindsay Lohan, and most vividly Britney Spears, have become glamorized by the tabloids as arguably the highest-profile celebrities in the United States today.

Little attention has been paid to the overwhelmingly negative effect that such role models can have on the female youth of our nation.

The unhealthy lifestyles of these women have been frighteningly apparent, as evidence of substance abuse, eating disorders and countless other maladies have arisen as a direct result of all this unwavering press coverage.

 For instance, most individuals who keep track of the news have become aware of the fact that former pop star Britney Spears has been in and out of various rehab facilities for substance abuse.

This serves merely as a stark reminder of the detrimental effects that a lifestyle of incessant parties and nights filled with binge drinking can have on a young woman.  

Television and magazines have become so saturated with images of these women that they are hardly avoidable.

It seems to me, however, that the press coverage of this debauched crop of women is propagating substance abuse  among young girls who lack apt parental figures and have a minimal degree of parental control restricting their choices.

The problem has intensified to the point where women are beginning to comprise a sizable portion of our nation's substance abusers.

In a recent survey of the problem, it was found that women accounted for 31.5 percent of the nationwide admissions to substance abuse treatment. 

The 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) yielded far more frightening results, showing that approximately 41.6 percent of women ages 12 or older reported using an illicit drug at some point in their lives.  This is a higher proportion than at any other time in history. 

Further effects that have resulted from this drought of positive female role models are a growing prevalence of scandalous, arguably seductive forms of dress amongst young women.

A great deal of the blame, if not all of it, can be placed on the parents. 

It is of utmost importance that a more responsible and censorious form of parenting emerges. For there has never been a greater prevalence of depravity in all forms, be it violence, sexuality, and vulgarity, in all facets of life. 

Great care must be used by parents to ensure that their daughters are not influenced by the negative female figures that dominate the media.

It is my belief that the media should focus on more positive female role models, who can at least impart some laudable and desirable moral values on the emerging generation of female youth.

Headline: Review: Amy Winehouse - Back to Black (Music)
Author: Ana Davis / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
She's an admitted wino, a tabloid magnet and a powerful singer -  Amy Winehouse is an artist unlike any current performer. Her sophomore album Back to Black, released in the United States March 13, is an honest tale of heartache.

After winning Best Female Solo Artist at the Brit Awards, Winehouse received major attention from the U.S, music scene. The album was released after much publicity centering on her performance antics caused by too much alcohol consumption. Around the time of the album's stateside release, Winehouse cancelled two consecutive gigs in London (both allegedly due to "unforeseen circumstances"), later admitting that she was too drunk to perform. In another alcohol-related incident, she ran off a London stage mid-show to vomit. This time, she did finish the set.

All this is easily forgiven, however, because Winehouse is among the great female talents of her generation.

In Back to Black, Winehouse's influences are too obvious: girl groups of the '50s and '60s. Her voice is as soulful as Aretha Franklin's and her lyrics are as raw as Alanis Morrisette's post-Dave Coulier-breakup days.

Her producers, Salaam Remi (who returns from Frank, Winehouse's first album) and Mark Ronson (who has successfully worked with Christina Aguilera and Robbie Williams), made Back to Black sleeker and more theatrical than Winehouse's first album.

But it's the incredible juxtaposition of the music and her vocals that make Back to Black stand out from among recent female vocalists. Winehouse's vocals manage to stand out from the music which feels too old. In "Tears Dry on Their Own," Motown's "Ain't No Mountain High" is almost sampled. Classic background "doo wops," common in female groups of the 60s, are heard throughout the album. Winehouse manages to seem young among the overstated music, a feat that makes the album a must-listen.

 Her persona makes her believable: she sings about refusing rehab (in the appropriately titled "Rehab") and immediately, the listener knows Winehouse is just human. In "You Know I'm No Good," she sings about cheating and being caught.  She seems to use her lyrics as a method of therapy, rather than just entertainment.

All her problems are on display in Back to Black : dealing with heartache and addiction, leaving men and being left by them. Her lyrics are universally understood and relatable by both men and women. We know what you mean, Amy: we all wish we could sing our problems away. 

Winehouse has been recognized by American music critics, but gets most of her attention from her antics. Aside from the drinking, she is rumored to have an eating disorder and has admitted to engaging in self-injuring behavior.

Most critics agree that Winehouse is a powerful artist and her album is original in a scene full of drum machines and lip synching. 

Some compare her to Janis Joplin; hopefully this amazing talent won't suffer the same tragic end.

Headline: Theater department ends 2007 season with two dramatic plays
Author: Angelina Esposito / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU theater season will break ground this Spring semester with the productions of Proof and Silence. Unlike their most recent predecessor, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, the two are neither musicals nor comedies. The performances will add something new for the theater department: usually one production runs consecutively for two weeks but these productions are implementing a rotation performance schedule. Basically one play will perform one night and the following night the other performs.

According to Stephen Neal, business manager and instructor for the theater department, the choice was made to further the students education.

"As far as I know it's the first time we've done rotating rep," Neal said. "We're doing it to give our students the experience of performing in a rotating repertory set so when they get out in the real world they'll have it under their belts."

And according to some students the experience is appreciated.

"I think it's a really interesting idea. I'm waiting to see what happens when the actual show goes up. I think it will bring people's attention," said Juan Espinosa, who will be acting in Proof. "It's really cool to be doing two shows at one time. It's a good experience."

Silence has been described as a "dark, sexy medieval fairy tale" by its director Tracey Moore, assistant professor and head of voice and movement for the School of Theater. However there isn't much to say about this production since the goal has been to keep most of it a secret. The cast are under strict agreement to remain "silent" and not to divulge any plot twists or other information.

However, one thing the cast discussed was their bonding as the show has progressed and excitement for the show's performances.

"We have become a family through this production. We came in as just acquaintances and we've become much closer through the rehearsal process," said Michael Leon, who plays King Ephelred in the production.

Although a lot of the play has been kept secret, several characters seem to parallel the medieval romance The Adventures of Silence. Whether or not the modern play will follow true to the medieval one is uncertain.

One piece of information offered was that this is a show meant for mature audiences. It touches upon the subject of sexual identity and includes partial nudity and violent scenes. There may be other subjects not suitable for younger audiences.

Whereas Silence deals with swordplay, Proof, aptly titled, takes a more academic route and incorporates mathematics. 

The play, directed by assistant professor Judy Bauerlein, is about a young woman, Catherine, who's recently deceased father, Robert, is a mathematical genius who's final years on earth were spent dealing with a mental illness. After his death a young man wants to go through Catherine's father's notebooks in hopes of finding a mathematical break through. The conflict arises when Hal finds an amazing original mathematical proof and Catherine claims that she's the author, not her father.

The play focuses on Catherine and her battles with an overbearing sister, a fear of following in her father's footsteps, medically speaking, and proving the proof is hers.

Many might find this plot familiar because the play was turned into a 2005 movie starring Anthony Hopkins, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jake Gyllenhaal and Hope Davis.

Espinosa commented on having to take on the same role Hopkins portrayed in the film.

"When I first got the role everyone told me I have to live up to Anthony Hopkins," Espinosa said. "I think every actor has their own take on the part and I wanted to build my own interpretation. [But] even thought the two industries are starting to come together they're still very different."

The works will be running in rotation April 4 - 15 at 8 p.m. all nights except for Sundays which are 2 p.m. matinee shows. Tickets are $8 for students and $10 for general admission.

If interested in attending either play contact the FIU theater box office at 305-348-3789.

Headline: Grand Slam: Tennis team ranked among best in nation
Author: Chris Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For the women's tennis team, success has become part of its character. Its not just sought after, but expected.

The highest ranked team at FIU - they cracked the top 25 this past week - has established a winning culture thanks to the relationship teammates have with each other and with their coaches, Ronni Bernstein and Carlos Casely.

The team has compiled an impressive 13-4 record, with two of their losses coming against two teams ranked in the top 10: Florida and the University of Miami.

After beginning the season ranked No. 35, the Golden Panthers have gone up 10 spots and look to continue their ascent.

Bernstein has pulled together an impressive group of talent that not only performs well together, but also sets up the team for future success.

The team has a group of freshmen who are ready to take in the knowledge and experience from the seniors and are ready to dedicate themselves for the next four years to their team.

Having been at the head of the program for 11 years now, Bernstein has become an excellent recruiter, using both the international appeal of FIU and the simple desire of living in South Florida.

"There are so many benefits to playing here aside from being in Miami," Bernstein said. "The hard schedule that we play every year ensures visibility to the players, and there are so many opportunities to be found."

It certainly appealed to Maria Pazo, former resident of Rio Cuarto, Argentina, and one of the freshmen that Bernstein has brought in to be part of the program, sporting an 8-3 doubles record and impressive ambition,

Maria hopes to take her skills professionally once her collegiate career is done.

The chance, however, comes from the opportunity that has been provided to her by both the chance to compete at the top college level and the teachings bestowed upon her by her coach.

"We get into a lot of discussions, if that's what you want to call it," Pazo said. "Coach always gets through to me, though, and in the end it does nothing but make me a better player."

While the coaches have certainly done their job in sculpting top players, the old guard of the team, the seniors, have also gone beyond the call of duty in ensuring the young ones are up to the task of competing at the highest level. 

However, experience and the simple task of competing is something you can't teach, and four years of both have netted Paula Zabala an eight-match winning streak, only losing one set over the course of it.

"Experience has made such a difference this year for me. Much of the success this year comes from what I've collected over the past four years," Zabala said.

Having been around for the past two Sun Belt Conference Championships, she hopes to make it three in a row at the end of the year. 

Showing the wisdom of an experienced athlete, Paula stresses that nothing can be taken for granted.

"Just because you are ranked high and there are high expectations doesn't mean you can just walk right in and win," she said.

Coach Bernstein certainly agrees, taking 







caution when asked about her goals for the year. 

While the NCAA tournament is certainly the greatest goal to be seen on the horizon, she reminds that the conference championship cannot be overlooked.

A dent certainly can be made in the national picture with a second round victory in the NCAA.

The second round is where the Golden Panthers have been knocked out, not because of upsets but rather to tough seeding.

"Since the tourney is scheduled regionally, the second round always pits us against powerhouses UM or UF," Bernstein said. 

While FIU is certainly more talented and better than the opposition that is in the same situation with athletics, it is tough to compete against the schools that can pick and choose who they would like.

A victory over these schools would certainly make a national splash.

The chance to even compete with these schools and maintain a high ranking over the years is testament to the fantastic job the coaching staff has done. 

By putting together a group of girls who get along and have such good chemistry, coach Bernstein has done as much as she can to ensure not just present but future excellence.

"The girls really get along well with each other, and I think that has a good part to do with the success," Bernstein said.

And when things don't go so well between the players, "Coach is always there to sort things out," Zabala said.

With the home stretch coming in the next month, it will be time for the players to turn in their best performances, starting with one of the most important matches of the year on April 15 against the University of South Florida.

Five days later, it will be on to the conference champions where the girls will be looking to defend their titles.

Then in just over three weeks the team will play the NCAA Championships.

Headline: Baseball team sinks Harvard Crimson with offensive display
Author: Adam Wasch / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU baseball team took advantage of a mid-week game against Harvard to tune up for the upcoming weekend series against the 21-5 University of Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin Cajuns.

The Golden Panthers (15-13) battered the Crimson (3-8) pitchers in a 13-6 victory to bring FIU's all-time record against Harvard to 8-1.

FIU put on an offensive display in the bottom of the sixth inning scoring five runs to break the game wide open. Heading into the inning tied at four, junior Raimy Fuentes singled to left and he advanced to second on an errant pickoff attempt.  Freshman Junior Arrojo was hit by a pitch, and senior Chris Dunn singled to load the bases.

Junior infielder Corey Lozano was hit by a pitch to bring the score to 5-4.  Junior outfielder James McOwen chopped a single over the Crimson third baseman to score Dunn and Arrojo.  Junior John Petika ripped a double to the right-center field gap to score Lozano and McOwen capping the five run inning.

"I waited on the pitch," Petika said.  "The pitcher was throwing sliders and I took it to the gap. It is tough playing a mid-week non-conference game, but we all got up for it and put our work in. We want to keep the momentum going to the weekend against ULL- Lafayette."

In the bottom of the eighth inning, senior infielder Bryan Pullin hit a towering shot over the left field wall that completed the Golden Panthers' scoring at 13.

The Golden Panthers briefly took the lead prior to the five-run sixth inning when Coach Danny Price manufactured two runs by calling a double steal with no outs.

Dunn advanced to third and Lozano advanced to second.  McOwen and Petika each produced fielder's choice RBI groundouts to give FIU the lead 4-3.

The Crimson chased junior starting pitcher James Lajiness out of the game by putting up three runs in the second inning. Freshman pitcher Brian Santana was brought in, and he shut down the Crimson offense for four innings.

Santana was brilliant giving up only one hit in four innings with three strikeouts.  Freshman Evan Ellison shut the door with a scoreless ninth inning.

"My slider and fastball were working for me," Ellison said.  "The goals were to come in, keep the ball down in the strike zone, and close out the game."

Coach Price's team continues to swing a hot bat with their 11th game of 10 or more runs this season. The team is second in the Sun Belt Conference in runs (235) and batting average (.331) behind Florida Atlantic.

Individually, McOwen leads the Sun Belt Conference in hits (58) and batting average (.483), while senior Bryan Pullin became FIU's "Hit King" against Troy last weekend.

Unfortunately, the pitching has been hit-or-miss this season. 

While FIU has two Sun Belt Conference Pitchers of the Week Chris Allen and Corey Polizzano, the staff has a combined 5.81 Earned Run Average ranking toward the bottom of the Sun Belt Conference.

"I am more concerned about stopping the other team than I am about what we are going to do offensively," Coach Price said.  "We are going to get our shots offensively. We need to try to win one pitch at a time and not reinvent the game."

Coach Price feels that regardless of the opponent, the team needs to keep its focus on the main goal of winning ball games, especially with an upcoming schedule that includes the Ragin Cajuns and the University of Miami Hurricanes.   

"I am trying to refocus these guys and get them on an even keel," Price said.  "We committed too many errors tonight."

Headline: Commentary: Rainy weather, heckling strangers among reasons fan loves baseball
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the first pitch of the Major League Baseball season just minutes away (or it may have already passed, depending on when you're reading this), I thought I'd serve you a treat and give you my five favorite things about baseball season.

Now I know what you're thinking, "Why should we care what your five favorite things about baseball season are?" 

Well, I don't have a logical answer for that, but I'm going to tell you anyway.

So here they are - in no particular order:



1. Weather



This one's an easy one. I mean, who doesn't love the weather during the spring? 

The signs that the season has arrived include clear skies, mid-70s everyday, and a nice wispy breeze for no apparent reason. But that's not the weather I'm talking about. 

I'm talking about that mid-July weather that goes so well with an afternoon baseball game.

Who doesn't like a good sweat as the sun hits you on the left side of your body, giving a lovely, uneven tan? 

And nothing, absolutely nothing, beats the taste of a $9 beer in those lovely plastic bottles that enhance the flavor so much.

If that isn't enough, after baking in the sun for two hours, the baseball gods bless us with a nice and cool torrential downpour. 

Not only does this downpour cool us off, it also prolongs the game, meaning the baseball fun can sometimes last an extra seven hours.



2. Tailgating



On those days where MLB decides to get crazy and schedule a night game, there are usually some people who arrive two hours early and proceed to tail the gate. 

Yes, the food and drink are delectable, but that's not what's so special about it.

After a few beers, I love to see guys in their early 40s decide to relive their glory days of high school baseball by playing catch. 

The fun really starts when they start telling each other to "go long" and these guys start sprinting for balls as if it were game seven of the World Series. 

My toes start to tingle whenever I see one of these guys backpedaling into a barbeque, or better yet, lose a ball in the sun and have it plunk them in the face.



3. Hecklers



You got to love these guys. Nothing makes a game more enjoyable than a stranger three rows behind you yelling nonsensical musings to everyone from the players, umpires and beer vendors.

They are masters of word usage and creativity with statements such as "You suck, ump. Better get those glasses checked out." And who doesn't love, "you throw like a girl"?

These usually non-bathed individuals make the experience so much better for me and those with their families.



4. The seventh inning stretch



With the game of baseball changing so rapidly (from the fans to the stadiums to the players), it's good to see that this little bit of tradition is staying in tact. 

Nothing says "baseball" like singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" (because the song is about baseball).

It's also nice to know that the sport of baseball in general cares about its fans. 

I mean, after sitting for six and a half innings, it's easy to pull a muscle or something if you don't stretch yourself out.



5. World class athletes



Going to a baseball game can really be a damper to your ego when you see the amazing shape most of these athletes are in.

Some of these guys have such strong abdominal muscles that it looks like their stomach protrudes outward in the shape of a ball. 

Some of these same guys with the super strong abs work out so much that they can't even run. 

They're so sore from working that it looks like they're waddling along the base paths.

You also have to admire the stamina some of these relief pitchers have.

Sitting in the bullpen, making jokes and farting on one another can easily fatigue any normal person.

I hope you all can look forward to these five things and learn to appreciate the subtleties that make the game of baseball America's pastime.

The Golden Panthers football team will play a spring game on Friday, April 20, at 7 p.m. at FIU Stadium.
The game was originally scheduled for April 18, but coach Mario Cristobal decided to move the date due to a schedule conflict.
Cristobal said too many of the players had classes on Apr. 18 - the final day of the spring semester - so the game had to be moved.
The first four games of the 2008 season are against competitive, out-of-conference opponents such as Penn State University, University of Maryland, University of Miami and Kansas University.

Headline: Teammates' friendship stretches across globe
Author: Xavier E. Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Freshmen point guard Erick Nsangou and forward Cedric Essola's friendship lasted over two continents, and several winning and losing basketball seasons. The Cameroon natives first met playing basketball in their home country.

After a turbulent season in which several of their teammates left the team or were dismissed, the freshmen duo is ready to enjoy their well-deserved break.

"If there was one bright spot about this year, I would say it was the progress of our freshmen," coach Sergio Rouco said.

Located on the west coast of Africa, the Cameroon teammates said they are very enthusiastic about advancing their basketball careers at FIU.

They first became teammates three years ago while playing for the Cameroon national youth league.  

"Basketball in Cameroon was unorganized; here it's treated like a serious job," the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Essola said.

"The sport here is more athletic and faster," the 6-foot, 200-pound Nsangou said.

While living in the capital city of Yaoundé, the duo led Cameroon's Under-20 National team to a silver medal in the 2004 African Championship.

Their impressive performances caught the eye of NBA scout and fellow Cameroonian Joe Touomou. He invited the boys to play in the Basketball Without Borders training camp in South Africa, and later arranged for them to finish high school in the United States.

In search for new opportunities the two teenagers headed for Florida with high expectations.

Essola joked about practicing on dirt courts back home compared to the wooden courts of the United States. Basketball often takes a backseat to soccer in Cameroon, and because soccer is the main sport in Cameroon, basketball is not funded as well.

"Schools are better here and so are the conditions for playing basketball," Essola said.

With Touomou's assistance, they received full scholarships to Florida Prep, a small private school in Port Charlotte. When they arrived, the high school consisted of only 67 students and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Regardless, the school served as a pivotal educational institution in their lives.

Their first obstacle in their new home was conquering the language barrier. The national language of Cameroon is a dialect of French, so the boys spent most of their senior year learning English.

"At first it was difficult understanding what plays were being called," Essola said.

He adjusted quickly to his new home as his production on the court demonstrated it. He averaged 19 points and 11 rebounds a game his senior year in high school.

They considered this period in their young lives very stressful. As graduation grew closer everyday, they were growing wary of their future in the United States, but their anxiety decreased when they met Rouco.

"One day during an open-gym practice, coach Rouco sat in the bleachers watching us," Nsangou said. "He approached us and started to speak of FIU and its academics."

Rouco invited them to visit FIU and offered both of them a full scholarship. Rouco said his decision to take on the boys was highly influenced by their determination.  

"They bring a great attitude everyday. They're very dependable on what they do," Rouco said.

In his first college basketball season, Essola totaled 76 points, nine blocks and 61 rebounds. 

Nsangou totaled 132 points, 18 steals and 64 rebounds. His strongest ability on the court is driving to the basket.

During their first semester at FIU, Nsangou and Essola excelled beyond the court, each earning a 3.5 GPA.

"It's hard balancing class and basketball, but coach helps us not forget our studies," said Essola, an international business major. 

Both freshmen agree if it weren't for each others' support, their experience would've been far more difficult.

"Erick is someone I can relate to; someone I can always talk to," Essola said.

"We're like brothers," Nsangou said.

Headline: Officers still complain over faulty radios
Author: Naihobe Gonalez / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
Andrew Axelrad, assistant general counsel of the Police Benevolent Association, continues to receive e-mails from FIU police officers complaining about their department's radio communications system, even three months after department officials announced finalization of work on the system.

"We've been getting a lot of complaints from officers," Axelrad said. "We forward as many of them as we can to be sure that the department is aware."

The Beacon reported Dec. 6, 2006, that Public Safety was in the middle of a difficult transition from the state communications system to its ultra-high frequency system. 

After purchasing new radio equipment, problems arose and officers were unable to communicate with each other, at times placing them at risk.

The department hired Code 3 Technology in July 2006 to smooth out the glitches, but as problems persisted, by December 2006 it began consulting with a new company, Rapid Wireless of Florida. 

According to department officials, as of Dec. 6, 2006, Public Safety had spent $157,438 on the radio system, $60,976 more than the initial projected cost of $96,462.

Three months later, officers continue to deal with what they call a "poor" system.

Officer Frank Torres, the PBA representative, voiced concerns over the slow progress of the system.

"It's working the same way as before," Torres said. "At [Biscayne Bay Campus] it goes down all of a sudden for hours at a time. The radio system works poorly, period. It's going to get somebody hurt."

Sergeant Douglas Ochipa, the day shift supervisor, said he has seen some improvement, but that it is inconsistent.

"From one day to the next it varies from pretty good to very bad," Ochipa said. "It's probably improved a little overall, and at least it's not constantly bad anymore. But technicians haven't been here very much lately."

In a March 26 interview with The Beacon, Bill King, chief of Public Safety, explained that since December the department has met with new vendors to discuss enhancements that have been put in place as well as new ones that may be needed. 

According to King, Rosa Jones, vice president of Student Affairs and Undergraduate Education, who oversees Public Safety, has personally met with vendors. Axelrad said PBA representatives have also been invited to participate in meetings.

"For the most part, the system is coming along better, I feel. It's not going as fast as some people might want, but I still think we're making good progress," King said. "We put a lot of emphasis on vendors moving as fast as they can."

King said that in the past three months the department has ordered different parts and is looking within the next few weeks to do surveys at both campuses to see how the signals are being sent and received. 

They would then decide if they'll move forward with the system.

King offered that substantial improvement has been slow to come partly because the department changed vendors, which caused time lapse issues, and that while the radios are not working at optimal levels, they are working "okay."

In order to ensure officer safety, King said his department is considering purchasing a limited number of county radios to offer to officers as a back-up. 

When asked for other alternatives, King said that a consultant with no affiliation to local vendors could be hired if necessary.

"We've already made an investment," he added.

According to Leidy Cabrera, accountant to Public Safety, nothing substantial has been spent on the radio system since the change in vendors. 

Cabrera explained that Code 3 Technology was not paid in full since its agreement was not carried out, and that leftover funds had been used to finance the new vendor.

Although no additional funds have been spent, in December Public Safety submitted a funding request for $150,000 to the University as a strategic initiative, according to Claudia Paz, director of strategic development.

"That was to serve as a back-up," King explained, "in case we had to do something different with the radio system."

In a second interview held March 29, King said he was in the process of obtaining an independent consultant. 

He said the University would issue a Request for Proposal, an invitation for companies to submit proposals and bid for a contract. 

"We don't have an estimated timeline, but I would say we are anxious to have the system up and running," King said.

Axelrad, from the PBA, was disappointment with the pace of progress.

"It's frustrating because [Public Safety] can't seem to get a grasp on what the problem is so that officers can effectively and consistently communicate with each other," he said.

Headline: Students win at UN conference
Author: Maria Chercoles / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
As representatives of Slovenia's World Food Program Committee, Christian Ochoa and his FIU team partner, had to evaluate Slovenia's resources to finally reach an agreement with Russian and Ukrainian representatives - two of the toughest negotiators present at the meeting.

But the duo wasn't really creating diplomatic relations. They were pretending. 

Ochoa was one of the 17 students who attended the National Model United Nations in New York March 19-25. After a week of global discussions and negotiations simulating the real United Nations, the FIU team won all the awards it was competing for: Outstanding Delegation and Outstanding Position.

"There are a lot of countries in the committee, even some you don't have a good relationship with, so you have to find what you are going to work with," Ochoa said about the discussions.

Denmark, France, China, India and Senegal were some of the countries with which the FIU team had better luck negotiating with, Ochoa said.

Every day, the students tried to pass resolutions addressing regional conflicts, peacekeeping, human rights, economic and social development, the environment, and other issues relevant to the country they are representing. The FIU team was assigned to represent the central European country of Slovenia.

They attended the conference in New York as part of a three-credit political science class offered every Spring semester, called Model United Nations. Aaron Ramirez taught the class this year.

"The focus of the class is teaching students how to research, how to write, public speaking and negotiating skills," Ramirez said. "Then they go to the conference to practice everything they learned," Ramirez said.

However, acceptance into the class is very competitive. More than 75 students applied this year, but only 17 were accepted after a series of interviews, Ramirez said.

Upon acceptance, students spend the semester doing research and learning as much as possible about the country. They learn about the country's resources, policies and environmental issues, among other things. They also prepare for the two Model UN conferences the team then attends, Ochoa said.

It was FIU's European Center and Europe's important role in world politics what encouraged Ramirez to select a series of European countries for this year's model. Slovenia was the one the conference organizers approved for the FIU team.

The first one was the Harvard National Model United Nations, in which the team was awarded for the first time.

The second, the National Model UN, in New York, is the oldest conference of its type, and the most prestigious. FIU has won an outstanding award for its eighth time and for its seventh year in a row.

This year it won two Outstanding Awards. The Outstanding Delegation award evaluates the team members' performance. The Outstanding Position Papers evaluates the team's research and brief presentation.

"What is great about the program is that students come in with a lot of potential, and they soon realize that they can compete at high levels.

Every single year we prove that FIU does have the potential to compete at national levels," Ramirez said.

In fact, over 200 universities from across the world participate, bringing together thousands of students. The FIU team performed above the top 10 percent, Ramirez said.

One of the more exciting parts of the conference is that discussions and negotiations take place in the actual UN building.  

Another student who was involved in the conference was Amanda Fernandez. She was one member on the committee of Europe.

"You meet with other countries and see what you what to negotiate about," said Fernandez, a junior majoring in political science.

To her the biggest challenge was passing resolutions.

"At the end you want our resolution to pass," she said. "You have to be willing to compromise. Every country has its own agenda. You have to know … where the country stands and what the UN has done, so that you know what you have to negotiate and what not."

In the end her team passed 15 resolutions. They sponsored one through education and democracy. And as a personal plus for Fernandez, she got to meet people from all over the world. 

"I loved working with everyone, even if it wasn't your partner," she said. "We met them and were able to work with them."

Headline: Charity raises funds for foreign group
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In an effort to help an array of charities around the world, Charity Ball International is holding it's fourth annual fundraising drive. This year's beneficiary is Centro de Educacion para la Salud Integral, an education center in the Dominican Republic.

Each year, CBI helps a different charity. This year, the charity event is under the direction of Jasmine Flores. 

CESI is a charity organization in the Dominican Republic that is responsible for the building and maintaining of community centers that provide poor communities a place to receive medical care, have social gatherings and educational affairs, among various other services.

Choosing CESI was a tough choice this year, according to Flores. Eleven other charities from China, Latin America and other countries were being considered during the voting process of what organization would be funded by CBI this year.

"It was over an hour of voting," Flores said.

Every November, a committee is formed to decide the CBI beneficiary. Old and new members are welcomed to join the committee and discuss the issues facing countries around the world.

The ball will be held April 7 in the Graham Center Ballroom at 7 p.m. The cost of admission for students will be $15 for one ticket and $25 for two tickets. Cost for faculty and non-FIU students will be $25 for one ticket and $40 for two. All proceeds will be donated to CESI.

"The ball is where we get most of our money for the charity," Flores said.  

But the ball isn't just a way to make money for the charity. Attendees are also expected to have a little fun. Besides the music and food, Flores sayid there will be salsa and merengue dancing, a slideshow and two keynote speakers.

The first speaker will be Kathleen Mitchell, the founder of CBI. Mitchell, who spent several months working directly with CESI, will talk about her experience with the organization.

Bianny Fernandez, the graduate assistant for the center of leadership and service and the second keynote speaker, will talk about the current state of the Dominican Republic and community service.

Flores also hopes guests will be informed about the Dominican Republic while attending the event. 

It is meant to teach attendees about the country and the impoverished state that many of its citizens are in. 

CBI strives to promote the understanding of different cultures across the globe and provide students with the leadership skills to do so.

CBI places strong values on children, commitment, hope and charity, according to their MySpace profile. 

The goal of the organization is for members to become more appreciative of life and the potential that they have to impact others.

There are several sponsorship levels. 

A donation of $500 will earn you the rank of Golden Panther, $250 Silver Panther, $100 Bronze Panther, $50 Blue and Gold, and $25 Friend of the Charity Ball. Of course the CBI welcomes donations exceeding $500.

Those wishing to donate to CBI, contact Flores at 305-348-9995 or at jflor011@fiu.edu or for more information visit their MySpace profile at www.myspace.com/charityballinternational.

Headline: Media Board elects new editor, general manager
Author: Betsy Martinez and Maria Chercoles / Beacon Staff 
&nbsp;
In a unanimous decision, the University Media Board elected Charlie Grau as The Beacon's new editor in chief and Pablo Penton as WRGP's new general manager March 29.

Grau - the paper's current sport's editor - ran against  Beacon staffers Ben Badger Jr. and Christopher Necuze.

"I would like to continue the level of excellence The Beacon has achieved this past year and raise the bar for those who follow," Grau said. "Honestly, I feel very happy and grateful for this opportunity and hope to accomplish much in the upcoming year."

Penton - WRGP's current traffic and training director - ran against Tom Morris and Dan Molluzzo, interim general manager. Grau will replace C. Joel Marino, who has been editor in chief since Fall 2006.

"He's had experience writing a wide range of stories, so I know maintaining the quality of the paper's content will be his strongest point," Marino said.

Grau has worked at The Beacon since 2006.

"In a competitive race, Grau and Penton demonstrated clear visions for the future of student media," said Alfred Soto, assistant director of Student Media.

Like Grau, Penton has also been working at the radio station since 2006. Penton - whose on-air name is "P. Duffman" - has a '60s and '70s rock show on WRGP that airs Thursdays at 6 p.m.  The name was inspired by a character on "The Simpsons."

"I was very nervous going in front of the Media Board, but I had prepared a lot," Penton said. "I'd like to reach out to other student organizations and make the student radio station a forum of University information."

The Media Board, the entity supervising both The Beacon and WRGP, consists of Lillian Kopenhaver, Dean of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, and faculty members of SJMC as well as other South Florida professionals with experience in media and media law.

Robert Jaross, director of Student Media, says the Media Board had the pleasure of interviewing three outstanding candidates for general manager this term. 

"Penton wowed the Media Board with his presentation, and I'm looking forward to working with him at the radio station that The New Times rated 'Miami's Best,'" Jaross said.

FIU's radio station has had a long history of challenges since its first transmission 20 years ago, when its signal wasn't strong enough to reach University Park. Today, WRGP has a staff of about 50 student deejays and directors, who are heard across Miami thanks to a new translator that was placed on top of the Green Library last year. Soon, students at the Biscayne Bay Campus will also be able to tune in.

Among the challenges Penton will face as the general manager is carrying out the plans of installing a translator at BBC, which would increase the station's reach to orth Miami-Dade and south Broward.

"That's my biggest goal … reaching out to BBC students," Penton said.

A 39-or-plus-hours-a-week job, the role of The Beacon's editor-in-chief has also had some changes since the student newspaper first came out in 1990, back when it was only published once a week.

Before The Beacon, however, there were other student newspapers and publications. As the new Beacon editor-in-chief, Grau will supervise a team of almost 30 editors and assistants and 20 staff writers.

He will also face the challenge of producing three issues a week, a plan initiatied to coincide with the University's move to a three-day class schedule.

The paper began going two time a week Spring semester of 2004. The change has been in the works for years and is expected to take place in Spring 2008.

"It's going to be a challenge, but it's going to be worthwhile for the students and the University," Grau said.
