Headline: NATURE CALLS: Efforts underway to save campus preserve
Author: Camila Martin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Away from University Park's crowded buildings and parking garages lies an environmental preserve with a variety of exotic plants and trees. With no signals around campus pointing to it, the preserve has been the site of concerts, photography contests and a subject of discussion after administrators tried to use its grounds to expand University development. 

The creation of the preserve was proposed in 1977 by two students taking a class with environmental sciences professor John Parker. Parker adopted the idea and integrated other students' thoughts into the project, which was officially approved by the senior administration and FIU president in 1977. It was finally established in 1978 as a nine-acre area to be used for research and nature preservation. 

"The main purposes of the preserve are to protect and restore the ecosystem and ensure that it enhances student learning," said Melissa Abdo, graduate student and research assistant.

Ever since, faculty, staff and students have added to the variety of native and exotic plants and trees. The preserve also hosts a butterfly garden, around 95 bird species - including 48 non-migratory species - approximately 20 species of amphibians and reptiles, and about the same number of mammals. 

In addition, a nature trail with 20 information points was developed between 1987 and 1988 by Mabel Miller, an environmental educator associated with the Key Biscayne Nature Center.

Since its establishment, the preserve has become an important resource for a variety of courses and disciplines such as biological science, environmental studies, visual arts, and science education. In addition, there are a total of 96 courses at FIU that use the preserve, approximately 76 belonging to the visual arts discipline. An estimated 1,750 students use the preserve each year for academic purposes.

"One of the advantages of the preserve is that it allows students to conduct research and learn in a real living laboratory without having to leave campus," Abdo said.

Despite its active role as a place to study nature, the preserve has faced battles against University proposals to destroy it. In the summer of 1998, the FIU administration wanted to build several fraternity houses there. After extensive discussions and faculty members' opposition, the fraternity houses were built on the east side of the campus.

The preserve celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2003, and to commemorate it, the Environmental Preserve Committee had a series of events including a photography competition, of which pictures were displayed in the Graham Center. Also that year, the FIU New Music Ensemble performed a concert there.

Since 2003, there have been other initiatives to use the area for development. However, Parker and other faculty members, staff and students have strongly opposed it. After their effort, Interim Provost Ronald Berkman announced last Fall that no buildings will be constructed on the preserve grounds for at least the next decade.

Through the last years, the preserve has also become exposed to natural dangers, including the introduction of plants not native to South Florida, such as Australian Pine, Brazilian Pepper and Burma Reed. These plants have a negative effect on the ecosystem.

Removing these invasive species requires lots of hands-on work, and for this reason, the environmental studies department hosts workdays every month in which volunteers help remove the plants.

Yet, as if invasive plants and development plans were not enought, the preserve now has a new threat after University administrators proposed putting a fence around it after complains that wild dogs inhabited the area.

Some of the preserve's future plans include developing a self-sustainable agriculture garden, a picnic area and a trail to facilitate access to it. However, Parker explained, most projects had to be put on hold until the administration comes to a decision on the fence debate.

"A fence would defeat the purpose of the preserve, since it would limit access to it. Having a picnic area makes no sense if students won't have access to it," Parker said.

Volunteers are always needed for the maintenance and development of the preserve, and those interested should contact the environmental science department located on the third floor of the Engineering and Computer Science building. The next preserve workdays will take place Jan. 30 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.

Headline: Government may increase financial aid
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Freshman German Muniz recently began working full-time to help cover the costs of attending FIU.

"I don't want to end up like my brother," said Muniz. "I don't want to take out more loans."

Muniz's brother attended two years of graduate school at the University of Florida. Though he graduated five years ago, he continues to pay $200 every month for his student loans and still owes about $20,000.

For his first year at FIU, Muniz received a Florida Bright Futures scholarship that covered 75 percent of tuition and a $500 federal Pell grant award. Pell grants do not require repayment and are awarded only to eligible students based on their families' financial need. For Muniz, $500 was not enough, so he resorted to a $3,000 subsidized federal Stafford loan. Stafford loans offer lower interest rates and deferred payments until after graduation.

Last week the U.S. House of Representatives voted 356-71 in favor of legislation that would help students like Muniz afford the rising costs of higher education. The College Student Relief Act of 2007, which would cut interest rates on Stafford loans from 6.8 to 3.4 percent over the next five years, is part of the new Democratic leadership's "Six for '06" goals for the first 100 legislative hours of the 110th Congress.

Rep. Debbi Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston and Rep. Kendrick Meek, D-Miami said in a press conference Jan. 17 that the proposal could affect over 100,000 college students in Florida. The bill would cost taxpayers $6 billion.

Francisco Valines, director of financial aid, commented on the proposed changes.

"FIU students would benefit most from an increase in the Pell grant award," Valines said. "A large number of our students [about 11,000] receive Pell grants, and those are the students with the greatest need."

At FIU alone, approximately 17,000 students receive financial aid. Of those, about 16,000 borrow funds. Last fiscal year, 59 percent of those borrowers took out Stafford loans for a total sum of $57.2 million. Unsubsidized loans totaled $39.3 million and Parent PLUS loans $2.6 million. 

Valines believes anything that makes college more affordable for students would benefit the University as a whole.

"I'd rather have a student say, 'Loans will cost less, so I won't work 30 hours a week, maybe I'll work 20.' Working is good, but the students are here to get a degree, and we know that for a lot of our students working gets in the way of their grades and the time it takes them to graduate," Valines said.

Though the bill passed in the House with an overwhelming bipartisan vote, its future in the Senate is uncertain.

Lending companies oppose the bill, and Democrats in the Senate hold the slimmest majority possible at 51-49.

If the Senate approves it, President George W. Bush must sign the bill to put the reforms into effect.

The White House released a statement Jan. 16 opposing the act.

In the Senate, the College Opportunity Tax Credit of 2007 bill was also introduced earlier this month, which would increase the availability of Pell grants.

Currently the maximum award per year is $4,050. Democrats in the Senate hope to increase the maximum Pell grant award by 26 percent to $5,100. Last academic year, FIU received $26 million in Pell grant funds.

This bill, along with the College Student Relief Act of 2007, is awaiting a hearing in the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. 

Keeping her finguers crossed, Muniz, who wants to study management information systems, decided not to take out any more loans. 

"I know I won't have time to study, but there's no other way. I'll just have to work full-time," Muniz said.

While the debate continues in Capitol Hill, students and officials remain alert.

"We just stand on the sidelines and watch," Valines said. "Financial aid is different from politics."

Headline: Scholarship offers students a chance to study abroad
Author: Jessica C. Padilla / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Gabriela Junco will be traveling to Madrid, Spain, this February as part of a study abroad program. Once there, she hopes to stroll the city's historic streets, interact with the locals and savor typical Spanish dishes.

And she won't have to pay a single cent.

Why? Because Junco earned the American Airlines Global Leader scholarship that will pay for the program, an endowment she feels many students may not be aware of.

As a student majoring in art history and fine arts, Junco longed to study in Spain, a country known for its history and architectural treasures.

Although she currently receives financial aid from other scholarships, Junco's awards were not sufficient to pay for the round trip ticket to Europe.

According to Elizabeth Vretto, the head representative for AA at FIU, many students decide studying abroad would be out of their budget.

To help students take part in the experience, the Office of International Studies, in conjunction with AA, grants scholarships every semester to aid students interested and enrolled in this program. Every scholarship is worth a different amount depending on the destination and time of year. 

Junco was among the many applicants vying for the chance to study abroad.

"It is a huge accomplishment to have been awarded the Global Leader Award," Junco said. "I am very excited to travel to Spain since it enables me to challenge myself academically and artistically. Aside from that, I think it will be a rewarding experience from which I will grow."

According to Junco, the registration portion of the scholarship is simple and the requirements are not too demanding. In order to qualify for the Global Leader Scholarship, the applicant must maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.5, be an undergraduate or graduate student, submit an essay, resume and a short application. 

Finally, the award recipient must create an online journal narrating their study abroad experience. 

In November, Vretto chose Junco for the scholarship because she "embodies what American Airlines idealizes a student should be."

"This star pupil should be well rounded in all sense of the word and in an academically good status," Vretto said. 

This award opportunity is not limited to Europe. Students who want to travel to other continents such as South America or Asia may also qualify. 

FIU is one of 11 universities to be selected nationwide by AA. 

"Its primary interest is to better serve the needs of the community, therefore making a wide array of grants accessible to students," Vretto said. 

Vretto agrees with Junco that not many students are taking advantage of the opportunity to apply for the award.  

"Many students are not aware of this and other scholarship programs offered directly by American Airlines," Vretto said. "It is important that the student body knows that there are many scholarship opportunities offered through American Airlines that assist students with their college finances." 

AA also offers numerous other grants and scholarships which are accessible by logging on to their website http://www.AA.com/college.

Chavez comments on Castro's poor condition

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says Fidel Castro is "battling for his life," comments he made after he said he spoke with the Cuban leader for nearly half an hour several days ago. 

Chavez, a close ally and admirer of Castro, compared Castro's attempt at recovery to his guerilla efforts, when Castro attempted to overthrow Batista's government in the 1950s.

Castro has not been seen in public since shortly before July 31 when he announced he was temporarily stepping aside while he recovered from an operation. 

He has provisionally ceded power to his brother Raul.

Headline: Immigration Conflagration: Republican Congressman handles issue the wrong way
Author: Luis Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The issue of illegal immigration has always been a hot topic in American politics. One politician is trying to make it even hotter.

Enter Colorado Representative Tom Tancredo, who seeks to further inflame the debate over immigration policy even as it is already engulfing the American southwest and shows no signs of burning out.

Tancredo, a Republican, has been pushing for stricter immigration policy for some time and is trying to make it a big issue any way he can. Just recently, Tancredo announced that he is seriously considering making a run for the presidency.

This is the same man who infamously told conservative web site worldnetdaily.com that Miami is a Third World country and is being taken over by "thugs" and "separatists".

He was referring to the many immigrants who have made their home here in our city.

Tancredo wants to rip out Miami's heart and soul and, ultimately, a huge piece of American culture.  Is Tancredo aware that our nation was founded by immigrants hundreds of years ago?

Now I understand the need for controlled immigration, but Tancredo takes his public antics on the issue too far.

Blasting his opponents is one thing, but as far as saying "They're coming to kill you, and you, and me and my grandchildren" in reference to undocumented immigrants?

That is xenophobia at its most extreme form and this is not the way to champion immigration reform.

It is this kind of behavior that has not won many friends within his party, and Governor Jeb Bush and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen have fired back at Tancredo. The fact that so many people attempt to enter this country, legally or not, can't be ignored, but shutting ourselves from the entire world is not the answer.  

Whether it's business, the arts, diplomacy and many more areas too numerous to mention, the United States has thrived on its citizens working together with it's visitors and many of them have proudly declared our nation their very home.

In this age of heightened paranoia due to the fear of terrorism, it is easy to see why Tancredo has garnered much support to his anti-immigration cause. 

It is also easy to see that this push for extremist immigration reform is veering toward creating more unnecessary fear within our nation.

We, as the American people, native or immigrant, can't afford to let our own fear tear us apart. 

It is individuals like Tancredo who, knowingly or not, propagate the public's fear of invasion to the point we will be afraid of anyone different.

We are already fighting a war on fear abroad.  Let's not take that very fear back to our home where it can do even more damage.

Headline: Students lack pride in own university
Author: Iris Febres / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students at FIU wear many faces when it comes to pride in their University. I constantly see FIU students traveling the halls wearing University of Miami jerseys and loudly complaining about how horrible FIU is in comparison to UM.

But when it comes time for the free food and giveaways at FIU events, the same students will show up in droves wearing happy faces and exclaiming how wonderful FIU is.  It gets on my nerves. 

In high school I can remember my classmates asking me where I was going to college. I found myself quietly mumbling FIU, hoping they would hear Florida State or Boston University or even, if I was lucky, Harvard. I felt ashamed to admit I had been rejected from my first choice and had settled for FIU instead. I have come to realize, however, that FIU was not as bad as the word-of-mouth made it seem. I soon overcame my snobbery.

The fact that FIU has relatively easy admission requirements has something to do with the lack of pride students have. Though I love my classes and professors, the University's standard is low. "They let anybody in." said junior Dawn Higgins.

Also, when rating FIU, many students only take into consideration the football team's record. Sure, our football team may be lacking, but that hardly justifies the way that many look at the school.FIU is constantly expanding, getting newer and better resources. When people start badmouthing FIU, they tend to forget the fact that it recently received accreditation for its new College of Law (in record-breaking time), as well as approval for a college of medicine.

But there are those who support the school wholeheartedly.    "FIU is an excellent university with strong academics and work ethic."said Gabi Rosell, a freshman. "Though I wanted to go to another university [Norte Dame] I had to come here instead, due to financial reasons." said Rosell.  

Many students select FIU for financial reasons. The University boasts one of the lowest tuition rates in the state. According to admissions.fiu.edu/costs, Florida residents pay a little over $3,000 in tuition costs a year, and over $15,000 for out-of-state.

 From my experience, I'm certainly getting my money's worth and I'm glad I'm not forcing my parents to pay over $40,000 a year for the same basicundergraduate courses. I have grown to love the University and I don't wish to leave just yet. But for those who do, "If you want to be a Terrier, Hurricane, Gator, or whatever, then try to go to that university." said freshman Michael Fernandez.

Headline: Editorial: FIU may suffer from university system overhaul
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Florida's state university system has grown quickly over the past 30 years, and if the state follows the recommendations of a report released Jan. 18, it will start suffering some serious growing pains over the next few decades.

The report is a harsh indictment of the state higher education system. It describes how grandiose ambitions, misguided financial policies and runaway enrollment growth have created a bloated giant. 

Also, the report offers detailed solutions, which together would amount to a full-scale, long-term overhaul of our university system and leave Florida with top-of-the-line higher education. The problem is that the solutions it provides are far from easy fixes. 

On the contrary, if the report's recommendations are applied in full, both students and universities can expect to make some painful sacrifices. 

For students, tuition may increase and some scholarships may vanish. Meanwhile, some universities would be stripped of their research status and reduced to a lower "teaching universities" tier.

On the face of it, these seem like grim measures, but a further analysis shows that our current state of affairs is worse yet.

Florida university tuition rates are among the lowest in the nation. Along with generous programs like Bright Futures scholarships and the Prepaid Tuition Program, most Florida college students are paying little to no tuition, and the rest are paying next to nothing compared to national rates. 

Cheap tuition might be attractive, but it doesn't necessarily translate into a good deal. You get what you pay for, the saying goes, and in this case, it is painfully true. Out of 11 Florida universities, only 2  have national name recognition, University of Florida and Florida State University, and out of these, only one - UF - has a respectable national academic ranking.

The rest make Florida's university system into the Wal-Mart of postsecondary education, offering wholesale-quality education at bargain-basement prices. While Florida has only one top 10 school in the academic rankings, it does feature three of the largest universities - FIU among them.

In this, FIU is a perfect illustration of what plagues Florida's state universities. 

The legislature gives universities money based on how many students they enroll each year. The more students they enroll, the more money they get. Consequently, universities are motivated to become bigger, but not necessarily better. 

Policies like these have casued FIU to grow into the 37.000-student behemoth it is from the 14,000 seedling it was in the early '90s.

The report suggests opening new universities by converting community colleges into four-year teaching institutions, for example, so that college students are distributed among many small schools rather than a few big schools. 

Meanwhile, universities would be funded according to academic performance rather than enrollment numbers, so they would be motivated to outperform, rather than outgrow, competitors. 

All these measures would ultimately translate into better academics. Where FIU fits into that scheme, though, remains unclear.

What is true, however, is that as a school that aims to present itself as "Miami's Public Research University," FIU is probably in for a rough adjustment. It is likely that it may need to sacrifice, or at least curb, its research ambitions.

But what is good for higher education in Florida will end up also being good for FIU and for South Florida college students in general, and it will only work if Florida's state schools - FIU included - decide to cooperate rather than compete.

Headline: Men's basketball starts road trip with loss
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coming off two gut-wrenching wins over Sun Belt Conference opponents Denver and North Texas, coach Sergio Rouco marveled at his team's impressive play on the defensive end.

Unfortunately, all of the defensive magic displayed in the past two wins at home disappeared in a 77-69 loss against the Louisiana-Monroe War Hawks (12-8, 6-2) on Jan. 20. 

Still riding the wave of momentum from a thrilling one-point victory over North Texas Jan. 18, Rouco believed his team didn't come out ready to compete.

"Its hard losing but sometimes it's even harder to handle success, and we did not know how to handle two wins in a row," Rouco said. "I do not make excuses for my guys. They may have been a little fatigued, but they did not come out with the eye of the tiger." 

The Golden Panthers (8-11, 3-6) showed flashes of brilliance early by jumping out of the gates with a 7-2 run.

However, the War Hawks wasted little time getting back into the game as they buried three bombs from 3-point range en route to a slim 20-16 advantage.

With the War Hawks finding their groove from the perimeter and a stagnant offense beginning to plague the Golden Panthers, somebody needed to step up to keep them in contention.

The answer came in the form of junior guard Chris Fuller, who poured in six of his first half points in the final two minutes to pull the Golden Panthers into a 32-32 lock at halftime.

In the second half, the War Hawks' guard tandem of Jonas Brown and Lance Brasher began to penetrate the Golden Panther defense for a series of easy buckets. 

Fortunately for the Golden Panthers, freshman point guard Erick Nasangou was able to drill a big 3-pointer and penetrate the lane for an easy bucket, while sophomore Alex Galindo and freshman big man Nikola Gacesa took turns cashing in easy buckets in the paint to tie the game at 49 with less than 12 minutes remaining in regulation. 

When it seemed as though FIU was poised to take complete control of momentum and the game, Galindo, the team's biggest offensive threat, had to go to the bench after picking up his fourth foul of the game with 11:02 remaining. 

With Galindo confined to the bench, the War Hawks took full advantage of the Golden Panthers lack of size and lack off firepower from the perimeter. 

Brown powered his way in the lane at will and swing men Jordan Payne and Darien Bynum began to get into the action offensively for the ULM, who went on a 10-3 run to open their biggest lead of the game, 58-52. 

Staying true to the up-and-down theme of the game, the Golden Panthers responded with a quick 6-0 run of their own as Fuller swished two jumpers and senior guard Johwen Villegas made good on a lay-up in the paint. 

Galindo re-entered the game at the 3:16 mark and made two quick buckets before fouling out. 

Although Fuller made good on two more buckets in the final minute, and Nasangou continued to dive into the paint, it was FIU's inability to contain Brown and Brasher on the other end that cost it the game. 

Together, the ULM combo made good on 7-of-8 free throws in the final minute of the game to secure the win for the War Hawks.   

"We hit the wall at the 10 minute mark in the game. I thought we weren't playing as hard as we were in the Denver and North Texas games. I think a lot of it had to do with fatigue. We got tired and hit a wall," Rouco said.

 Fuller, who has developed into the Golden Panthers' defensive stopper, poured in a career-high 19 points.

Villegas finished with 13 points and seven rebounds and Nasangou continued his impressive play of late with a career-high 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting. 

Coming off arguably his best performance of the season (24 points, 6 rebounds and a game winning three pointer against North Texas), Galindo, plagued by foul trouble, shot 4-for-7 from the field to finish with just 10 points and five rebounds in 26 minutes of action.

Brown led a balanced scoring attack for the War Hawks with 19 points, going 6-for-11 from the field. Brasher added 16 and Payne and Bynum chipped in with 11 points each.

The Golden Panthers will look to get back on the winning track on the road against New Orleans on Jan. 25.

Headline: Peyton Manning still has much to prove
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
o, Peyton Manning finally made it to a Super Bowl. All those years of, "he can't win a big game" can now be stricken from the record. Or can they?

It's easy now to forget about all the times Manning couldn't come through under pressure, especially after he just finished beating his archnemesis, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. But just because he finally got to cut deep into the hearts of New England fans - instead of being laughed at by them - doesn't mean he's completely off the hook yet.

The comparison has been made hundreds of times, but Manning has a lot to do in order to catch up to Brady.

And you may think it's unfair to compare the two because Brady had a better coach, a better defense or a better supporting cast of offensive players, but you'd be wrong.

Bill Belichick may be the best coach in the NFL, but he wouldn't be considered so if it wasn't for Brady. After all, it was Brady coming off the bench in 2001 who brought New England its first of three Super Bowl rings.

To compare both quarterbacks fairly, you'd have to look at them as two average office workers.

In that case, Manning would be the popular guy at work who knows everybody. He's friends with the bosses, sometimes swaying their decision-making, and prepares for work more obsessively than anybody else. 

On an average day, he arrives to work 30 minutes early, just to get a head start on everyone else. Because of that, his production numbers surpass everybody else's.

However, when it comes time to deliver a big presentation, office Manning would arrive late, lose his note cards (forgetting his preparation) and proceed to slur and mumble through his speech. Because of this, he ultimately loses a big potential client.

For office Manning, this hasn't happened once, it happens every time he has a big presentation for a big potential client. If it wasn't for the fact that everyone - even the bosses - liked him, he'd be out of a job, wouldn't he?

Office Brady, on the other hand, may not be super popular, but he is still well known. And he doesn't arrive super early to work every day, but his production numbers are highly above average. He also spends a lot of time helping co-workers who may not be as popular or productive.

And unlike office Manning, office Brady shines when it comes time for a big presentation for a potential client. In fact, the majority of clients he has gotten were those the company thought would be long shots.

Now, ask yourself which of those two employees would you choose to handle the most important presentation of your life?

Now, what if office Manning finally gets one client; would you change your choice? Or what if Brady blew a shot at just one client?  

I'm sure your choice would stay the same - Brady. Hands down.

Don't get me wrong. I like Manning - he was my fantasy football quarterback. But if my life depended on a game and I had to choose one quarterback to lead a team, it would be Brady.

Take, for example, the careers of Deion Branch, David Patten and David Givens. All three were pretty unknown players until they started played with Brady in New England. After those three left the Patriots to sign big money deals - those three combined make more than twice as much as New England's entire current receiving corps - and are now nowhere near as productive as they were under Brady.

He just makes those around him better. 

Manning, on the other hand, has had an All-Pro supporting cast.

So, Manning can enjoy his time down here in Miami for these next two weeks. And if he wins on Feb. 4, good for him, but he'll need to do it a couple more times if he doesn't want to be known as the second-best quarterback of his generation.

Headline: Fitness fair encourages healthy lifestyles
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Recreation Center will be holding its semi-annual "Spring Fitness and Health Fair" Jan. 31st, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. 

While the main goal of the fair is to promote the center, it also has an ulterior motive, according to Christina Theosevis, a fitness coordinator and director of the fitness fair. 

"Recreation Services is committed to providing the students, faculty, staff and alumni of FIU with a convenient and affordable way to adapt a healthy lifestyle," Theosevis said. 

The fair will be composed of various health exhibits including stress relief mini massages to take care of that pinched nerve, blood pressure screening and body composition testing. 

There will also be a chiropractor representing the Wellness Center giving spinal screenings .

Like previous fitness fairs, there will be numerous free giveaways including health snacks, bags and water bottles. 

In addition to giveaways, there will be prize drawings and educational health literature available for fair attendees to pick up. 

"We usually keep along the same lines [when executing the health fair]," Theosevis said. "We wanted to have the Red Cross here during the fair, but they had to cancel."

Headline: My LIFE! EXPERIENCE: DNA test shatters family image
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I come from a pretty big family. I have four sisters and a brother, but we're not all full siblings. We came from the same mother and I only have one full sister, Cathy.

Throughout my life, we have literally done just about everything to each other; we've broken bones, given each other black eyes and called each other names. My two eldest sisters even put my brother into a dryer and turned it on.

Despite our petty squabbles, we have never stopped caring about each other. I don't look at any of my siblings as half siblings but as my brother and sisters. 

I had a clear picture of what my family was like. I knew who was in it and why - until my father pulled me aside one day and said I might have another 30-year-old sister.  

Needless to say, I was speechless. 

Two months later, the DNA paternity test results came in and it was official: I had another blood relation.  

Apparently, before my father met my mother, he had been intimately involved with another woman and had a daughter named Lisa. My father did not take responsibility for her. He's basically been living a lie for the past 30 years.   

For the most part, I've remained very calm about the whole situation, although my sister Cathy has had several episodes. She's no longer "daddy's only girl" or even the oldest sibling. Her identity has been completely shattered. Meanwhile, my vision of the family has crumbled.

The day the results came I had the longest and most serious conversation I've ever had in my life with Cathy. I discovered even small details, such as how the children were named, made her sad. I was named after my father, Lisa was named after my father's mother, and Cathy - she was named after no one.

All this has even hurt my half-sister Denise, who has no blood relation to my father. She considers my dad her second dad because he raised her. The two have always been very close. But from the time Lisa reappeared into our family my father has barely had any contact with her - even though he lives less than five minutes away.  

My father has been very insensitive to everyone's feelings. He doesn't do it maliciously or on purpose, he just doesn't have the best of common sense.

Almost immediately after Lisa was back in his life, he had already decided to alter his will to include her. While I don't care at all what money I get when he passes away, if any at all, (I'd rather pretend he'll be alive forever) I do care that he was so quick to take away from his two children who have known and loved him their whole lives. 

I don't consider blood the determining factor for who is family and who's not. Since the incident, my father seems to have completely forgotten about the family that'd been there all along.

Family isn't blood. It's a lifetime of knowing a person. My father just doesn't get it.

Right now, I have no clue if I will ever want to meet Lisa or even speak with her for that matter.

A part of me just doesn't trust her. Perhaps it's the pessimist in me, but I just don't understand how Lisa could be so nice to the man who shunned her for 30 years. 

The fact my father gave me power of attorney really eased a lot of the fears I had.

He's been having a lot of surgeries and a procedure on his spinal cord is scheduled to happen in the next few months.

So knowing I could make his medical decisions and no one else made me feel a lot more secure.

So while my fears over my father's health have been put to bed, the uncertainties I have are still rampant. I don't know what's going to happen. All I can do is hope things end up as best they can, regardless of how bleak the situation may seem.

Headline: FORUM FARCE: Students bring on the comedy in upcoming musical
Author: Angelina Esposito / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
The FIU Theatre Department is presenting a musical once again: Stephen Sondheim's A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.

"It's clever, witty and chockfull of sexual innuendo with nothing too risqué to deter family audiences," said Matthew Mur, who plays Senex, "a dirty old man" and father to the character Hero in the musical.

The musical takes place during the time of the Roman Empire and revolves around a slave named Pseudolus and his ambition to gain his freedom. By helping the master's son, Hero, woo the virgin courtesan, Philia -who is promised to the great Miles Gloriosus of the Roman army- Pseudolus is promised his freedom. Along the way, Pseudolus encounters sexy courtesans, a pimp and other quirky characters, creating a chain reaction of hilarious events as his quest for freedom unfurls.

The musical theater process is something new for many theater students at FIU because the department doesn't offer a musical theater track in their curriculum. So while some of the actors involved with A Funny Thing have formal musical training, several of them don't. However, this doesn't mean they can't sing - they all sing very well, according to Renier Murillo, who plays Marcus Lycus, the "seller of flesh" or in other words, the pimp.

"A blend of musically trained and those that aren't is a unique experience," Murillo said.

But the singing isn't what is considered the difficult part of the show - it's the comedic aspect of the piece that requires the most attention.

"Comedy is serious business," says Phillip M. Church, director of A Funny Thing and associate professor. "Comedy can't be unfocused." 

And his actors feel the same way; many saying the belief that comedy is easier than drama is a myth.

"Comedies are so much harder because it's harder to find the jokes funny after rehearsing them everyday, then add to that, singing and dancing," Murillo said.

The students play stereotypic roles but try to break the mold, avoiding monotony while having fun with the characters they're playing.

Jennifer Marie, who plays Philia, goes so far as defending her character, with whom she said she has formed a strong attachment.

"I love playing [Philia] because she's a lot like myself in different ways and I'm able to display my quirky side and my comedic side," Marie said. "I think people see Philia as air-headed but she's more innocent and na've."

While most of the student actors play only one character, the play has a trio of young performers called the Proteans, who share one name but play many roles from eunuchs to roman soldiers.

In addition to the student actors, technical positions - like stage managers and the assistant director - are filled by students.

Among the technical aspects of the show are the costumes. Designed by Professor Marina Pareja, the costumes are inspired by Federico Fellini's Satyricon and are still in the process of being completed. 

"The whole idea was doing something different," Pareja said. "The comedy is already formulaic so we wanted to do something different."

The cast and its directors are excited about the play and their hard work seems to be paying off, every day getting closer to perfecting their performance in anticipation of opening night.

"[I want the audience to leave with] a glow, just warmth," Church said. "The warmth of comedy and laughter."

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, will be performed Feb. 8 to 11 and Feb. 15 to 18, $8 for students and $10 for adults. Other upcoming shows this semester include Silence and Proof in April.

Headline: Program highlights African studies
Author: Raquel Maya / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After taking over as director for the African New World Studies program last August, Akin Ogundiran had a vision of increasing awareness of African studeis at FIU.

A Nigerian native, Ogundiran replaced Carol Boyce Davies as director for the ANWS program. 

"It was an honor and a privilege when asked to take over the directorship," Ogundiran said.

Since his arrival to the United States in 1993 and then to FIU in 2001, Ogundiran has made it his own academic mission to advance the study of the people of Africa and their development. 

"As an Africanist, I immediately recognized the importance of working with [the ANWS program] and its interdisciplinary approach. My interaction with the program was very intimate from the beginning, almost six years ago," Ogundiran said.  

Ogundiran attributes his early experiences in Nigeria as one of the main driving forces behind his academic pursuits.

"I grew up in a traditional environment in which history was always present. You tend to listen and pay close attention to the stories around you," he said.

After completing his Doctorate at Boston University, Ogundiran joined FIU's History Department as an associate professor in 2001.

"We have to be creative in how to stretch our small budget," Ogundiran said. "We have to partner with other departments and programs in order to further our own goals."

Ogundiran not only has his own set of goals to achieve as director and professor, but his primary objective is to further the awareness of African studies at FIU. 

"I believe that undergrads are beginning to see the importance of area studies, which can explain the popularity of all of the classes our program offers," he said.  

Currently, the ANWS program offers African studies classes through the history department as well as offering students specialized certificate programs within ANWS. The program has also begun offering a growing number of art and culture classes, in addition to the dozens of lectures and community events they put on each semester.

Ogundiran took much pride in announcing the Program's plans to establish the first African study abroad program at FIU within the next two years. In cooperation with the University of Miami, a program in Ghana will focus on culture and tourism and bring together several schools within FIU.

Rosa Henriques, ANWS program coordinator, said that the ANWS office has been very busy since Ogundiran came in as director. 

She mentioned the proposal for a Bachelors of Arts degree in African studies that was submitted last semester as signs of the program's growth.  

They hope to offer this degree to students by 2008.

Originally intended to promote research of African culture and provide some courses through the History department, the program has branched out to establish itself as what some say is the "preeminent source of knowledge on African peoples in South Florida."

Headline: Writing program receives grant
Author: Ana Davis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Creative Writing program recently received a $15,000 grant from the Lawrence A. Sanders foundation of Boca Raton to be used for the renovation of Academic II, room 218, where most of the program's classes are held.

"This grant is a vote of confidence in the students, it confirms that the community values them," said Les Standiford, director of the Creative Writing program. 

Students in the program, such as graduate student Scott Cunningham, take most of the classes required by their curricular program in AC II 218.

Cunningham said that upgraded accommodations in the room would result in a better studying environment. Currently there are no estimates of the amount the upgrade would cost.

"I can't wait [for the upgrade to be completed], the environment definitely affects what we learn. This will make us feel right at home. We could use bigger desks to place two or three sheets [of paper] on so we can work better," Cunningham said.

Standiford first heard about the grant after Florida Atlantic University received it. He was encouraged to apply and his research paid off.

The room will be rededicated after its inauguration as the Lawrence A. Sanders Seminar Room, after the Boca Raton resident and author. Sanders died in 1998. 

The date of the inauguration is still unknown as the specifics of the upgrade are still being worked out, according to Standiford.

A press release posted on the College of Arts and Sciences website says that AC II 218 will be upgraded from a standard classroom, with only desks for students and a television, into a "modern seminar room."

"The creation of the Lawrence A. Sanders Seminar Room will provide a state-of-the-art learning facility for [the Creative Writing program] and other programs on the Biscayne Bay Campus. We trust this is only the beginning of a long and mutually beneficial association between FIU and the Sanders Foundation," Standiford said in the press release. 

Like other rooms in that building, 218 is not equipped for PowerPoint presentations.

The room, which stands alone across the hall from the Dance Studio, is one of the smallest classrooms in AC II. But its old, shabby desks and the unkempt color of the walls are anything but inviting, something professors of the department hope it will become after the renovation.

John Dufresne, faculty member of the Creative Writing program, explains that the room will most likely have a conference table, new carpet and paint, a flat screen T.V., a DVD player and will be equipped so professors can teach with the aid of PowerPoint presentations.

"We teach screenwriting, so being able to show movies [in DVD format] is very important. Sometimes I have to bring my own DVD player," Dufresne said.

Many professors in the program agree that 218 needs an upgrade.

"The improved atmosphere will have a very positive effect on the students and what they write and discuss … It makes us all feel that what we are doing is honored by the University," said Dan Wakefield, faculty member in the department.

"It has been difficult to teach graduate writing workshops [in AC II 218] as students sit on chairs with tiny attached desks that slope at an angle. While there have been comical moments, too much of the time is spent picking up manuscript pages from the floor," said Denise Duhamel, another professor in the program. 

Standiford also said that although the Creative Writing program has first choice in using the room, other departments would be able to use the room as well. The sharing of the room is at Standiford's discretion since he is the director of the program.

"It will be reserved for our classes but other than that, I don't see a problem," Standiford said. 

The Creative Writing program is a 48 credit program that, when completed, earns the student a Masters of Fine Arts degree. Students cannot earn bachelors in Creative Writing specifically. 

According to the Office of Graduate Admissions, workshops that go towards the degree include short fiction, the novel, popular fiction, screenwriting, creative nonfiction and poetry.

For Standiford and Dufresne, the grant is validation that the program is being well received by the community.

"We've needed this for a long time. We have a terrific [Masters of Fine Arts] program, its time to feel legitimate and be able to talk seriously in round table discussions," Dufresne said.
