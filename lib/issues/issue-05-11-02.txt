Dear Editor,

I just wanted to say a few words about Mr. Sneed.

Mr. Sneed was an innovatitive, charming, gentle teacher.  

He always treated everybody with courtesy and respect and his class was an oasis. He thought with creativity and with humor and he inspired his students to have faith in themselves.

If it was not for him, I probably would never have gotten the courage to contact an editor.  Thanks to Mr. Sneed's advice and encouragement I I got several articles published.  

I was his student more than 3 years ago, but I still keep the papers that he graded for me because his remarks where uplifting.

I can only hope that he knows that we will miss him deeply.

Headline: Football to take on UM in 2006, 2007
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The football team will gain yet another instate rival. Only this time, they won't even have to leave their own county.

The Golden Panthers and national powerhouse University of Miami have agreed to play two games at the Orange Bowl.

The games - set to be played on Oct. 14, 2006 and Oct. 6, 2007 - will mark the first football meetings between the two schools, which are located only 11 miles apart.

"From every measurable standard, these games will have a tremendous impact on our program," said FIU athletic director Rick Mello. "Recruiting, ticket sales, media exposure, alumni out reach, marketing and above all, exposure in our own community will be significantly enhanced by playing the five-time national champion in our hometown."

 Head coach Don Strock added, "This is a great opportunity for a young program like ours to play a team that has won five national championships."

UM coach Larry Coker agrees.

"It'll be good for both programs and the fans of both schools," said  Coker. "FIU will give our fans a reason to come, and it'll draw FIU fans, too."

Judah Hernandez scored his second game-winning goal of the season to lead FIU's men's soccer team to a 1-0 overtime victory over defending Conference USA champion Memphis on Oct. 28. 

Other than that, not much went right for the Golden Panthers over the weekend.	

As has been the story during most of the season, FIU struggled mightily on the road. Following their dramatic win over the Tigers, the Golden Panthers lost to Alabama-Birmingham 3-0 on Oct. 30 - FIU's fourth shutout loss in its past six road games.

"For some inexplicable reason we came out flat in a game that was all important," said head coach Karl Kremser, in his 26th season with FIU. "It's just beyond me. It's the most frustrating thing I've ever gone through as a coach."

Hernandez has scored FIU's last three goals on the road, dating back to Sept. 7. Shawn Crowe earned his fourth shutout of the season against Memphis to help FIU clinch a spot in the Conference USA tournament.

Headline: BACK WITH A BANG
Subheadline: Three seniors help revive volleyball team
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers have got their groove back. 

It's evident in the intimidating approach of Anna Dmowska. You can sense it as Laura Vogel blocks an opponent's spike back in her face. And it's crystal clear when Carolina Cano dives recklessly for a dig.

The three seniors on FIU's volleyball team are enjoying quite an exhilarating run. With a mix of enthusiasm and athleticism, they've triggered the team's 12-11 start to the 2005 season. 

"I'm really excited to play and I feel like I really want to do it," Dmowska said. "That's all that matters when you play a sport: That you want to do it and you're excited and you're enjoying yourself on the court."

But Dmowska wasn't having much fun last season. Alongside Vogel and Cano, she suffered through FIU's worse season since entering Division 1 in 1987. The team finished 3-23 and missed out on the Sun Belt Conference tournament.

"I personally cried a couple times after games because Division I couldn't stand [the] losing all the time," Dmowska said. "It was hard to play but it was harder to come to practice every day and give your best when you have 15 or 20 games lost already."

Head coach Danijela Tomic was hired this past January to put the pieces back together on a team that was SBC champion in 2001. She didn't wait long to make her presence felt. 

During spring break, Tomic took the returning players to Puerto Rico in an effort to gain match experience and build team unity. Mission accomplished.

"It was a lot of fun," Vogel said. "With the new coaches coming in, we got to bond with them, getting to know them in a different environment."

Cano adds, "I loved that trip. It was a good way of getting to know each other better and was also something to rely on to get a good start for the season."

The Golden Panthers lounged on the beach, went sightseeing and dined on island cuisine. On the court, they defeated the University of Puerto Rico and UPR-Mayag√ºez in exhibition matches, erasing the memory of the disastrous 2004 season.

Since then, Tomic has successfully recruited Anita Szymanska, Mina Spasojevic and Mariana Drumeva, all talented players with international experience.

"They're funny, but they're also really good players," Vogel said. "They just bring a sense of Europeanness."

Dmowska has been particularly impressed with Szymanska, her Polish countrymate. 

"She doesn't give up," Dmowska said. "If it's not working, she just keeps pushing hard. I really like [that] about her, as a player and as a teammate."

While the contributions of the newcomers cannot be ignored, it is hard to imagine FIU being successful without its senior class of Vogel, Cano and Dmowska.

Vogel's versatility makes her an invaluable volleyball player. She was a redshirt freshman during FIU's title run in 2001 and was the only Golden Panther to play in all games for FIU in 2004.

This season, Vogel leads the Golden Panthers with 75 blocks on defense and a .260 attack percentage on offense. 

"I just focus on what I need to do and I think the rest will come," said Vogel, who served an SBC-high six aces in FIU's win against Morehead State Nov. 3, 2004. "If I do my job, then that helps with the whole team doing their job."

Cano agrees with Vogel's philosophy. A Coral Park graduate, Cano transferred to FIU from Miami-Dade College and changed position from primary setter occational setter and to libero. When the ball gets by FIU's defensive front, Cano puts her body on the line to keep it in play.

"It's exciting, wanting that ball to come to you all the time," Cano says. "Because you're going to try to make the best you can with that ball. That's my thinking process, giving a good pass so a hitter can hit it hard."

Cano is constantly digging FIU out of trouble, literally. She leads the team with 250 digs (2.98 per game) and posted a career-high 20 digs against Stetson Sept. 16. 

"It's a matter of working hard in practice," Cano siad. "Having that feeling of not wanting to be like last year is a motivation for us to work even harder and do our best."

After Cano's digs reach setter Whitney Kenney, they often end up on the mighty right hand of outside hitter Dmowska. Dmowska is second in the Sun Belt with 297 kills, averaging 3.86 per game. Already she has eclipsed her 2004 season total by 34 kills.

"We are better prepared and much more confident," Dmowska said. "Individ ually, each of us push harder and I think coach has a huge ability to get the best out of us."

Trained by legendary Polish coach Teofil Czerwinski, Dmowska possesses a powerful approaches in her playing style. She will need to be on the attack often Nov. 11 and 13 when FIU hosts Arkansas State and Arkansas-Little Rock, respectively. 

These two final regular season games will heavily impact Sun Belt standings and determine whether FIU qualifies for the conference tournament.

"What I expect from us is to win," Dmowska says. "We have to step up and play better. It's on our side of the net what's going to matter the most."

The three seniors are bonded by more than a common jersey. Dmowska and Cano are majoring in recreational therapy, while Vogel is pursuing her master's degree in the same field.

"I help them out whenever they need it because I've already been through the classes they're taking," Vogel says. "So I'm there as somewhat of a mentor to them, but I'm still learning stuff myself."

 Before becoming best friends, Dmowska and Cano were junior college rivals in 2003. As a Missouri State University-West Plains Grizzly, Dmowska led her team to the NJCAA national title game by defeating Cano's Miami-Dade squad in the semifinal.

"It was the first time in my school's history that we beat Miami-Dade," Dmowska recalls. "I'm getting chills just thinking about it. I have this tape at home here and I watch it. It's the game of my life. I've never felt so excited to play."

The Golden Panthers bring that sense of excitement on every point, especially at home. FIU is a perfect 5-0 at Pharmed Arena and 5-1 in matches that reach a climactic fifth game, proof positive that the senior leadership on the team is strong.

So what could make this dream season even better?

"Winning the rest, going to conference and winning that," Vogel said. "It would be awesome, but we've gotta take one game at a time."

Having sparked a remarkable turnaround in only a year, the FIU volleyball team's seniors have tasted the fruits of victory. And they want more.

Subheadline: Rosenberg's chancellor nomination may bring many consequences
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Mark Rosenberg, university provost and vice-president, has recently been nominated for the Chancellor of the State University System position, one of the highest educational chairs in the state of Florida. 

This election could possibly invoke several positive, as well as potentially negative, consequences for the university.

One of the most obvious results would be a higher level of recognition for FIU and South Florida at a statewide level.  Already, several Miami citizens are positioned in levels of influence within the government, including Marco Rubio beginning in 2007 as a leader in the state House and John Dasburg with the Board of Governors in 2006. Moreover, FIU's name will now be recognized among the governing body in Tallahassee. 

However, certain questions may arise following Rosenberg's appointment, especially in matters relating to the controversial medical school initiative. 

Nov. 17, FIU will finally learn if the BOG will approve of its long contested medical school. The University of Central Florida, which is also vying for the same program, will find out their results on that day.

Since Rosenberg will most likely be appointed before this date, it is possible that opponents to the medical school decision will use the nomination to charge that FIU only received the program due to a former administrator being in a position of influence.

Rosenberg's greatest challenge will be to disprove these critics,  executing his job with fairness and impartiality towards all universities. 

"This doesn't mean FIU will get any special attention," said Bruce Hauptli, head of the Faculty Senate. "Of course, this could not happen without having friction with other universities." 

If FIU is given the opportunity to have a medical school, it should be because the university is qualified, not just because of Rosenberg's appointment.

Headline: Technology addiction at peak
Author: Christine Liriano / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"Good afternoon. Welcome to our first group therapy session. Now if you would stand up, state your name and your problem, we can start. You, over there with the silver laptop, begin."  

In response, a "Hello, my name is Christine and I'm a technology addict," is heard.

It's hard to imagine living without a cell phone, the use of instant messaging or even an iPod. Even though it's not healthy for us to revolve our lives around technology-based activities, we still do and become technology addicts. How can a technology addict survive in a world not dependant on technology? 

One thing's for sure, and it's that technology is growing increasingly more popular by the moment. It feels like just yesterday, when the walkman first came out and people from coast to coast were stunned and rejoiced, that one could take their favorite music wherever one wanted. Now-a-days if one were to mention a walkman people become flabbergasted. 

As time progressed, new and more technical gadgets began to appear - like compact, portable music players and cellular phones. With some cell phones, you can even check your e-mail, download music and have a portfolio of pictures taken with a click of a button. And how about navigation systems? What ever happened to the good old days when one had to stop and ask for directions or simply just get lost in the middle of nowhere? 

To us, technology is used to cover up the gaps in communication and relationship skills where we lack it. When was the last time you held a meaningful eye contact in conversations, or even had face-to-face conversations at all? 

What many call conversations are actually quick chats over the Internet through instant messages. Is it the fear of the awkward silence between conversations that motivates us to use virtual messaging instead of face-to-face confrontation? Or do we tend to take advantage of this technology and become lazy because we are given the chance to? Is it so wrong to want to be able to check e-mail, do homework, talk on the cell phone and cook dinner at the same time? 

Like many college students, we have all had several "AIM" windows up at one time talking to 15 different people about God knows what. As a result, most of those conversations were probably insignificant and a waste of time.

From the CD player to the MP3 player, to the iPod, technology has changed over the past years. But what has not changed is our demand and dependency on such gadgets.

We are now so dependent that our ability to function is weakened or eliminated if something breaks, crashes or is attacked. Some of us have even been known to count down the days until the newest iPod is released as if it were a holiday. Yet, instead of the iPod being the newest form of entertainment, it is now somewhat of a drug - a drug composed of plastic, metal and some wire. Now, don't get me wrong, this new technology is great and really making the world an exciting place to live in, but some people's dependency has gone too far. 

We need to become a society that benefits from technology rather than simply becoming dependant on it. We crave this new technology so it can supposedly "improve" our lives. 

We routinely assume the next advance in technology will ultimately make our lives better. This assumption is our pitfall because technology often hurts the quality of life it was formerly meant to enhance. Technology beckons us to exchange valuable time with those around us for time spent with inanimate objects. 

Technology certainly has helped us develop as a society and grow as a community. Advances in medicine, faster communication and less physical work are all fantastic.

 However, too much of something can be bad too. We too can suffer from technology addiction. Imagine a future in which group therapy is needed for technology addiction. 

Not only would people of all ages be treated for symptoms such as vision and hearing loss, socialization issues, but also for a general loss of enthusiasm for all life outside of technology.

Headline: Today's Music: Ain't Got The Same Soul
Author: Lauren Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Talk about today's music with anybody from the baby boomer generation who has a slight appreciation for music, and you most likely will hear a response like "Music today just isn't like the music back then." 

They will talk to you about the days when music was really music, when playing instruments or having an amazing voice were essential to success and admiration. Then they will probably go on about how music today has no soul, substance or resonance.  

It sounds like the lament of every generation.

Unfortunately, it's much more than that.  Though my first instinct would be to agree with the baby-boomer generation and pop in a Pink Floyd album, the situation is much more deeply rooted.  The problem with music today does not lie in a lack of good musicians, depth or in generations. It lies in the fact that the music industry, like much of the arts, has become just that - an industry. An industry that makes albums instead of art.

And what is a 20-year-old doing listening to Pink Floyd, the Beatles or Steely Dan? Could it be there's no sound to fill the artistic vacuum?

Although music has always been a great marketing tool in terms of jingles and such, today's music takes it much further, molding every hit to appeal to masses of teeny-boppers and musically un-inclined couch potatoes who couldn't tell U2 from The B-52s. 

 Presently, there is a direct correlation between a musician's image and a musician's popularity, while in past generations the music was the most essential part of a musician's success. A Carlos Santana concert this summer drove the point home.  

Clearly, here was a man whose ability to play guitar far outweighed his outer appearance and whose talent drove him beyond mere generational appeal. But could he have made it today? Would average-looking artists like Santana, Neil Young or Janis Joplin have made it in our image-obsessed, media-driven society, or would they have been forced to get by playing in clubs and sending their tapes desperately to music industry moguls? Would their auditions be reviewed by marketers looking for visual appeal, rather than musical originality? There are many musicians that exist out there today, desperate and capable of joining the ranks of bands like The Beatles and Led Zeppelin, but without the in-the-box appeal required for the industrial masses. 

Currently, music that is original, soulful and at the same time popular, has become an oxymoron. Arguably, the only way truly good musicians can have large-scale success today is if they possess an approved combination of looks, standardization and, maybe, actual musical talent. 

Some bands, such as Incubus have managed to combine true talent with approved looks, but what a loss in all the others who will never be heard.  Or should I say "seen"?

Popular music has sacrificed much of its originality, with different sounds seldom getting the opportunity to be heard. Most big record labels won't even consider promoting a musician unless the music sounds as if a majority of people will tune in to listen to it and eventually buy the album. 

Even musicians who have already earned their mark must battle to overcome the marketers. 

Fiona Apple's recent struggle with Sony's record label illustrates this perfectly. The multi-platinum selling artist, who has often been compared to music legends such as Carol King, struggled to release her most recent album, Extraordinary Machine. 

 Sony had it sitting on a shelf for nearly two years. This could be partly to blame on Sony's decision to hire a man with no musical background as their CEO, in place of the previous CEO, Tommy Matola. Apple's album was finally released in October, after being completely re-done with a more well-known producer. In a song she wrote in response to this travesty, she sings "Give us something familiar something similar, to what we know already that will keep us steady. Steady going nowhere." 

Music cannot make progress without risks, pretty soon it will not matter what radio station you put on- because they will all sound exactly the same.  Wait - don't they already?

Good music is out there - you can find it if you look. But you have to look, and look hard. Can we overcome the odds? It's all formula, and good musicians simply end up playing at local nightclubs, getting old, never having had the opportunity they deserved.  

The norm has become overly produced. One-dimensional pop stars like Britney Spears and Ashlee Simpson, who sit in the spotlight, are actually empty talents filled only by the wants of the masses. Instead of the legacy of a generation, music is becoming a forgettable background noise in our lives, a money machine based more on image than on talent.

Headline: Deceased professor missed by  students, faculty
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
From country music videos to field trips to a local jail, Donald Sneed did everything he could to ensure his students got the real-life experience portion of a college education.  	 

Sneed, a journalism professor and country music fan, died three days short of his 61st birthday from a heart attack at his home in Plantation on Oct. 30.

Sneed graduated from Southern Illinois University where he earned a doctorate in journalism and mass communication.

Before coming to FIU in 1996 as department chair for the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, he taught at Texas A&M, the University of Mississippi and San Diego State, worked at several newspapers across the country as a writing coach and helped prison inmates develop news-writing skills. 

Students, like Ana Ribeiro, remember Sneed as a person with a loaded heart and a great mentor. 

"He always said he was proud of me, and he was the only person who encouraged me to pursue this profession," Ribeiro, a junior majoring in print journalism said.

Ribeiro recalls the last time she was able to speak to Sneed a few days ago.

"The last time I spoke to him he said, 'We have to meet up soon or else I'm going to run out of chances.' If there's an afterlife, I'm sure he's watching over his students," Ribeiro said.

Sneed was known for sending graded assignments by e-mail and students viewed him as the mascot of the journalism program.

"I got most assignments he sent by mail, but it wasn't so much about the grades. It was about the teaching," said senior Alex Mateo. 

Senior, Daniel Diaz, a senior majoring in broadcast journalism recalls enjoying chocolate bars and watching videos with Sneed during class.

"What I remember most was that every time he put on a video he said, 'Here we go,'" said Diaz imitating Sneed's drawled Southern accent. "He also brought in expired Moose Bars and said they were a delicacy. We all ate them, and survived. He was the only professor I could actually talk to." 

Sneed encouraged students to prepare for life after graduation by obtaining internships and clippings from local newspapers.

"I got my [Miami] Herald internship because of him. He told me to call editors by myself. He gave me a phone number and told me to call right away. I did, and I got the job," said Diana Sempere, a senior majoring in print journalism. "Now, every time I report I do it the way he taught us in class." 

SJMC chair Allan Richards remembers the way Sneed welcomed him to FIU in 1997.

"During the summer I started working here he took this lowly adjunct to get his picture taken for a photo ID and library card. I couldn't figure out why a department chair would want to take a lowly adjunct like me on a campus tour - it was because he was a gentleman," Richards, said. "Don was admired, respected and loved by his students."

This semester Sneed was on sabbatical to complete a book on Ralph Renick, Miami's first television news anchor. His co-workers are eager to get the book published and say he kept them updated on it.

"He liked to send e-mails very early in the morning. He sent me e-mails about the progress of his book. And after interviewing Walter Cronkite he was trying to get him to write the foreword of the book," Richards said. 

Sneed was also famous for sending e-mails about famous people who wear bow ties and the cost of life while his generation was growing up.

"He sent lots of e-mails. It's his strange and sarcastic sense of humor that'll be remembered most, and it all begins by looking at his office," said Pat Rose, associate dean of SJMC. 

He left his dimly lit office stacked with newspapers dated decades ago. His desk is cluttered with about a hundred videotapes, and the shelves around the room hold over 300 books. A poster of Shania Twain smiling down on him decorated part of his wall.  

The university is encouraging students and staff to donate funds to the Don Sneed Memorial Scholastic Fund in lieu of sending flower arrangements. Checks should be made to the FIU Scholarship Foundation and sent to Lewis Alpert in care of SJMC.

Sneed is survived by his wife Elizabeth and daughters Samantha and Sarah. 

Although he will be buried in Mississippi, a memorial service for friends, faculty and students will be held at Plantation United Methodist Church, 1001 NW 70 Ave. 

Information on the time and date of the memorial services will be available at the SJMC department.

Headline: Provost nominated for state chancellor
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
A special committee of the Florida Board of Governors announced Oct. 20 that they had unanimously chosen to recommend Mark Rosenberg, FIU's provost and executive vice president, as prime candidate for the Chancellor of the State University System position.

Rosenberg, who has worked at the university since 1976, was chosen out of five finalists representing such colleges as the University of South Florida and Florida Atlantic University.

"The Chancellor Search Committee had various requirements they were looking for in the candidates," said Bill Edmonds, media coordinator for the Office of the Chancellor. "They really wanted someone with Florida experience and the right academic credentials, and [Rosenberg] fulfilled all those expectations."

The nomination will be presented to the BOG at a meeting to be announced.

If chosen, Rosenberg would become a sort of chief of staff, working directly with the governors and university presidents to run the state's public university system. His tasks would also include budget development and academic advocacy.

"Dr. Rosenberg has been an excellent leader, the best man capable of handling such high responsibilities," said Bruce Hauptli, head of the Faculty Senate. "He's a man who understands state-wide issues and the needs of urban universities, always asking how decisions would affect students before anything else. I know for certain that he'll be able to handle it."

Following the administrator's confirmation, (which both Edmonds and Hauptli believe is assured), Rosenberg will be working out of Tallahassee with a 62-member staff under him.

The provost says he has not yet begun to think of possible projects, though he recognizes one of his first jobs would be to help the BOG strategize a budget request to present before the State Legislature, a group formed in 2002 to oversee and handle the education system's money.

For now, Rosenberg admits he is just trying to figure out how to react to the news.

"At first, I felt a tremendous sense of gratitude and excitement on one hand, but also, a sense of loss as it related to my relationship with FIU," Rosenberg said.

No interviews were held for the position, but the provost believes his seven-year track record working with the BOG probably led to the nomination.

"I worked for four out of my seven years with all the current board members, so I guess that time counted as one long interview," he said. 

As the board meets to discuss the recommendation, university faculty and staff will have to begin the search for a possible replacement.

"We're going to be soliciting nominations from deans and the Faculty Senate, hoping to have an interim provost before the next Board of Governor's meeting [Nov. 17]," said President Modesto A. Maidique.

Though the president was not willing to provide the names of any possible candidates, he did confirm  the search for a permanent provost would be conducted nation-wide.

"[Rosenberg] presided over a time of great expansion for the university, both academically and in our quality," he said. "We're going to be looking for a candidate able to follow in those foot-steps, and we're going to look wherever we need to find that person."

The provost began his university career as an assistant political science professor, reaching his current position in 1998.

When asked what he believed to be his most important accomplishments, Rosenberg mentioned such joint efforts as the development of the Latin American and Caribbean Center, where he worked for 14 years; the university's attainment of the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa honor; his involvement in the establishment of a law school and marine biology initiative; the introduction of inter-collegiate football; and, most recently, this year's increase in faculty salaries and the record-number freshman class.

"I got to where I am through luck and through the mentorship of great people who knew what they were doing. All my work at this university reflects this, something I will always be grateful for," Rosenberg said.

Overall, Rosenberg is optimistic that FIU will continue to grow even after he has left.

"I see an institution that will continue to grow in size and impact on the community," he said. "I also know University Park will one day become University City, becoming an important hub of learning and culture in West Dade. FIU is destined to succeed."

Headline: Housing residents endure Wilma
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Though originally not expecting the strong winds and rains brought by Hurricane Wilma on Oct. 24, students around FIU nevertheless sought shelter either on or off campus, hoping to avoid the storm that shifted from category three to one once it had made landfall.

"I've never been through a hurricane before, so though I was sleeping when it finally happened, I kept waking up to look out the window and see what was going on," said junior Laura Kerr, who is originally from Colorado and resides in the University Park Apartments.

Many students remained on-campus during the storm despite warnings from the Offices of Residential Life advising those who had families close by to seek shelter away from the school.

Students who opted to stay in their residence halls were not evacuated to the shelter at Primera Casa, though residents of Bay Vista housing on the Biscayne Bay Campus were moved to UP on the evening of Oct. 23.

According to Cathy Akens, senior director for Student Affairs and Residential Life, the order to evacuate Bay Vista was ordered by the university even though the city of North Miami did not issue an evacuation order. Transportation was provided and the students stayed in Everglades Hall until Oct. 26. The building did not lose power and sustained minimal damage, including three broken windows.

However, the residence halls at UP were not so lucky, where power was lost shortly after the storm. The only exceptions were five UPA buildings and the fraternity houses.

 "I didn't go home for the hurricane and stayed in the Towers because I wanted to catch up on partying and homework," said sophomore Nickolai Koverda. "I expected the power to go out, but I didn't care. I just didn't know it would be gone for so long."

Facilities remained without electricity until Oct. 26, except for certain parts of UPA which did not regain full power until Oct. 31.

"These buildings are apparently on a separate electrical grid," Akens said. "Alternative arrangements had been made to provide students in these affected buildings with a place to stay in Everglades Hall. Many other students remained in their rooms or stayed with friends. Our staff encouraged students to help out one another, just as neighbors do in a community."

Many students living in rooms with light and hot water provided aid to those who needed it, especially during the days right after the hurricane.

"Because I was alone in my room and it got hot there at night, I chilled mostly at the apartments. A friend let me charge my cell phone there and other friends gave me food, which I needed a lot since I didn't have anything," Koverda said.

Kerr also agrees that she was able to make it through the week without power thanks to help from her friends.

"I had to throw away all my food because the fridge wasn't working and I ended up eating with other people," she said. "I'm also not a fan of cold showers, so I had to go over to other's rooms for hot water."

Even those few students who's apartments never lost electricity had to face challenges, particularly boredom during a week in which all classes were cancelled.

"I've never in my whole life had a week in which I did nothing," said sophomore Steve Perchikov, a student from New York residing in UPA. "I went with some friends to Orlando over the weekend just because there was nothing else to do. I had light here, but that wasn't going to help me."

Perchikov also stated that barbecues and gatherings held by students from all the residence halls helped create some additional entertainment, as well as the efforts from the resident assistants to keep idle students busy.

"It's a shock that so many people could lose their electricity, but the RA's did what they could to handle the situation. Everything was pulled off very well," Perchikov said.

During this time, FIU provided free meals for members of the university community who had stayed behind. They were provided from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. during the entire week and were distributed from the Fresh Food Company in the Graham Center.

"The Aramark staff did a great job and were able to open the morning after the storm. The meals also provided a nice opportunity for students to get out of their rooms and gather," Akens said.

Cleanup around the residence halls began soon after the storm had cleared. According to Jim Wassenaar, executive director of Student Affairs Operations and Auxiliary Services, "Housing pays the cost [for cleanup] out of reserve accounts and submits the cost to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for reimbursement." He stated, though, that the school would only receive a percentage back and not a full payback.

Wassenaar also commented that the Lakeview housing project, currently under construction, will be delayed due to the impact of the storm. He did not know how much the impact would be but reassured students that "the contractor will be asked to formulate a plan to get the project back on schedule for opening August 2006."

3.2 million FPL customers affected by hurricane 

Now that Miami has experienced the aftermath caused by Hurricane Wilma, Florida Power and Light's president, Armando Olivera predicts that 95 percent of customers will have light by Nov. 8. Until then, this means more canned foods, cold shower and no air conditioning for approximately one million homes in South Florida. Hurricane Wilma affected approximately 3.2 million FPL customers statewide. Power has been restored to 464,300 homes in Miami-Dade and 534,400 in Broward County. 

However, as of Oct. 31, 620,000 homes were still without power throughout Miami-Dade and Broward County.

Judge Samuel Alito nominated for Supreme Court
President George W. Bush nominated republican Judge Samuel Alito, 55, on Oct. 31 to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court. Some lawyers compare Alito to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia for his conservative views and even go as far as dubbing him "Scalito" or "Scalia-lite". Democrats fear Alito's nomination will shift the Supreme Court on abortion rights towards the radical right. 

"Of course, he's against abortion," said mother of Supreme Court nominee, 90-year old Rose Alito.

Alternatives for Bird flu vaccines are being worked on 

Avain influenza or bird flu is an infectious disease of birds which can be spread to humans. In response to the bird flu, several vaccines have been traditionally grown in fertilized chicken eggs for at least six months. Companies such as Chiron Corp from Emeryville, California and Sanofi-Aventis of Paris have begun clinical trials. The chicken egg method makes it harder for the companies to keep up with mutating flu strains and limits the quantity of vaccines produced quickly. 

Companies have looked for alternatives to produce vaccines by use of cell cultures and DNA cloning which could make the process quicker. Although they are not commercially available, the vaccines could be ready by next year.

Headline: New season of ''Lost'' unsatisfying to old fanatics
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"Lost's" debut season earned it its status as one of the most-watched shows on air. On ABC it has been second only to its contemporary hit Desperate Housewives. For a  year now,  J.J. Abram's and Damon Lindelof's creation (Alias and Crossing Jordan, respectively) have traced the fate of plane wreck survivors stranded on a remote, unknown island.  

Its popularity last season was due in part to the cult following that spread "Lost" forums and blogs all over the Internet, but with each episode it also seemed clear that the show was not the average deserted island  clich√© and had the potential to be much more than a mindless fad. 

Much of the show's merit comes from the writers' skill in character and plot development. 

The fairly large cast of 14 includes such different personalities as a doctor, a compassionate convict, a healed paraplegic, a lottery winner, a misunderstood smart aleck, an ex-rock star and recovering drug addict, a Korean couple and a former Iraqi soldier. 

Even with so many characters to juggle, each one is thoroughly fleshed out through flashbacks into their previous personal lives, which also make the new relationships between the survivors more complex. 

More importantly, much to the viewers' and characters' surprise, it is clear that their past lives are connected, not just to each other, but to this mysterious island where they now find themselves. Audiences have been kept especially intrigued by the bizarre qualities of the island itself; after all, it is home to a huge monster, a polar bear and a disturbed French woman, just to name a few. 

All of this brings up the question, has "Lost" kept up its reputation so far in their second season? A record 23.5 million viewers tuned in to the season premiere to figure out the same thing.  

Audiences had expectations; The show would have to keep them guessing, but also dish out some answers. 

Their anticipation wasn't in vain; the season started off with a bang. The premiere unveiled a completely new twist in plot, which caught the audience by surprise so much that they had to make sure they were watching the right channel. 

The hatch that Locke (the healed paraplegic) was so curious about at the end of the first season is inhabited by a man from Jack's (the doctor) past named Desmond, who claims that if he doesn't press a button on his computer (yes, he has modern appliances) every hour, the world will come to an end. 

The next three episodes explore this new storyline more deeply, and along the way bring up some fascinating psychological issues. As Desmond runs off into the jungle, are the survivors now going to be slaves to pushing a button every hour to save the world? Is this all a mind game and a hoax? 

Locke's mystical faith and Jack's skeptical logic once again clash, especially because their past experiences make both of them hold to their views very strongly, and even emotionally. 

These episodes provide some imaginative answers while offering even more brand new questions. 

Episode five has been the only one so far that did little to advance the plot and instead went into meaningless tangents. While the audience wanted to know more about the hatch storyline, they had to settle for following some of the characters aimlessly around the jungle. Because of the show's usual fast pace, any dragging episode stands out and can be especially frustrating. 

Although it may be too soon to tell how the rest of the season will go for "Lost", for the past few weeks it has alternated between third and fourth place among all shows on air, statistics that are not likely to go down anytime soon. No doubt the series' writers have a challenge ahead of them. They are expected to offer at least one solution during every episode, however small it may be, and yet produce increasingly creative mysteries; all this while they dedicate enough time to characters' developing relationships. 

As Locke would say, "They've earned our faith; they have rarely let us down in the past."

Headline: Attempt at genre mixture proves faulty for quintet
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There's a common misconception that blending two good things will automatically result in something even greater. Maybe that's the reason why Rehab decided to fuse alt-rock and hip-hop into one form of music. Unfortunately for the Atlanta-based quintet, something went wrong in their latest mixture.

Rehab entered the music scene with the modestly successful debut album Southern Discomfort. The rock-hip-hop hybrid produced the 2000 hit "It Don't Matter" and created a momentum that the group never capitalized on, instead choosing to disband soon after. Lead singer/rapper Danny Alexander is the only original member in the new line-up of Rehab, which explains why Graffiti the World sounds so cluttered.

Plainly stated, Graffiti the World is an unorganized mess. The album combines the worst elements of rock and hip-hop - poor musical arrangements and meaningless lyrics - into one bad creation. While groups like Run D.M.C., Outkast, and Linkin Park managed to focus on rock or hip-hop and be influenced by the other genre, Rehab tries in vain to use both forms of music equally. The lack of concentration produces bland results. 

On "Bottles & Cans," a song about abusing drugs and fearing the future, Rehab uses unexciting guitar riffs and even duller words to address a topic loaded with ample source material. Though Alexander has a commanding vocal presence, his performance is wasted by lines like "Don't over-think it/I think somebody told me that before/Yeah, whatever/That's my attitude. What can I say?"

"Red Water" reflects the problem of shallow lyrics even further. Alexander croons, "He was laying in an overflowing bathtub of red water, the first and the last time he relaxed," an allusion to his next door neighbor's suicide. Why did the man kill himself? Listeners will never know because the verses feature directionless memories about cars, baseball, Rice Krispies Treats, and Tom & Jerry. The song is yet another case of Rehab just creating, rather than carefully crafting. 

Graffiti the World has a few moments of redemption, namely during the title track. Rehab finally manages to streamline their efforts into an enjoyable song and Alexander provides the depth the rest of the album lacks. Over a beat that cleverly incorporates the rattle of a Krylon spray can, he raps, "Sort of morbid ain't it? This picture that I just painted/It's an epiphany I had, I realized how tainted/Our thinking really is when in New York I saw/A kid being arrested for tagging a f***ing wall."

While other rockers pine about losing their religion, Rehab gains it on "This I Know." The group channels a harmonic chorus and the classic Christian hymn "Jesus Loves Me" to showcase the strength that faith provides. Alexander does not preach or encourage listeners to seek a higher power, instead focusing on his personal struggles and love of Christ. He raps, "I try to be a role model/But I ain't going to lie, I still battle the bottle/That's my biggest struggle, I ain't the one to follow/Sometimes I get the urge to leave a 12-pack hollow." 

Alexander addresses his battle with alcohol abuse at other times during Graffiti the World, but not as well as he does on "This I Know." The song naturally exposes Alexander's weakness and showcases his ability to pen a respectable song. If he could have applied that same creativity to insincere tracks like "Bump" and "This Town," the album would have had much more substance.

The fault of Graffiti the World is that Rehab took the album title in a literal sense. The group tossed musical elements together the same way some artists splash paint on walls and expect classic work. 

This album unfortunately lacks the focus required to produce quality results. Though rock music and hip-hop have been married several times before, Graffiti the World will make listeners wonder if a divorce may be in order.

Subheadline: National Lampoon invades campus for reality show casting tour 
Author: Geoffrey Anderson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Programming Council's Campus Entertainment Committee brought the National Lampoon Disorientation Casting Tour to FIU on Oct. 20.

The tour is currently stopping at colleges nationwide to offer students an opportunity to host an upcoming reality show on National Lampoon Networks. Videos of the winners from each casting call are posted on the tour's website for visitors to vote on the best contestants.

¬†To host the tour, National Lampoon recruited "Real World" stars Chris "CT" Tamburello and David Burns. Before the FIU casting call started, both stars wandered the Graham Center food court to promote the event. Their presence was met by loud screams and flash photography. Admiring fans took advantage of the chance to meet some of their favorite MTV celebrities and the opportunity to take pictures of them.

From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., students filled the GC Atrium to sign up for the event and enter raffles to win free merchandise. The casting call was composed of several stages, beginning with a pre-screening. 

"We do a pre-screening at first because a lot of people sign up. The pre-screening weeds out who is shy on camera and who's not," Tamburello said.

The pre-screening involved having participants introduce themselves to the audience and the judges. This part of the casting call allowed contestants the freedom to represent themselves however they wanted. 

Several students simply talked about themselves, but some did interesting things such as freestyle rap. Many contestants were noticeably nervous, but others seemed relaxed in front of the camera.

Tamburello noted that the judges look for specific criteria in participants. 

"National Lampoon is all about funny - you need to be able to speak at length. You need creativity," he said.

After the pre-screening, the judges eliminated several participants and the remainder competed in doing improvised skits and speeches. Contestants were forced to make up fake commercials for some of the tour's sponsors such as Rohto V, an eye drop brand. The main sponsors included Microsoft and Dell. Also, contestants were teamed up to do skits similar to the ones on the television show "Whose Line is It Anyway?"

Between each round, Tamburello and Burns made funny comments and announced raffle winners. Lucky audience members got their hands on Dell laptops and MP3 players such as the Dell Inspiron 6000 and the Dell Digital Jukebox. Staff members also threw out National Lampoon t-shirts to screaming fans in the crowd.

Fans were treated to music from Seattle-based group The Mob Law. The band effectively mixes elements from different genres of music such as rock, hip-hop and reggae. The trio had an enjoyable time in Miami. 

"The spirit was really nice. It was cool having a multi-cultural crowd because everyone was excited. Everyone was sharing their own respect and all that stuff," said drummer and vocalist Caleb Cunningham.¬†

Only three students made it to the finals - Mary Knowles, Geoffrey Merconchini and Eric Wiltz.¬†All three contestants had to do a mock interview with The Mob Law. They were required to ask the band five questions and act like professional hosts.

Freshman Mary Knowles won the competition. She felt ecstatic about the experience. 

"It was really random that I did the competition, but I'm really happy that I did it because I had the best time," Knowles said.

SPC Campus Entertainment Chairperson Ann Marie Munoz also felt great about the tour. 

"The National Lampoon tour was awesome and SPC received great feedback. The turnout was impressive and the band sounded fantastic," Munoz said. "We hope to bring similar events to FIU next semester."
