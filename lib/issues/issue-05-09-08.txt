Subheadline: Despite producing four turnovers, football loses
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The upset-minded Golden Panthers entered Manhattan, Kan. with the goal of any football team: Win. However, 2003 Big 12 Champions Kansas State would not let the newly branded Division I-A team do it in their house.

The Wildcats, who had only a 13-7 lead at halftime, scored twice in under three minutes at the start of the second half and swung momentum back their way. KSU would not relinquish the lead as the game ended 35-21.

"This team plays every game hard for 60 minutes," said head coach Don Strock during a press conference Sept. 5. "Usually, in a football game there are two or three plays that really swing the momentum one way or the other. But in this game, there were probably seven or eight instances."

The FIU defense held it's own against the Wildcats, forcing four turnovers, which led to all of FIU's 21 points. 

Trailing 13-0, quarterback Josh Padrick connected with Julius Eppinger on a 12-yard touchdown pass with 42 seconds in the second quarter, to cut the led to six.

Eppinger ended the day with a career-high seven receptions,  for 53 yards and a touchdown. Senior Cory McKinney added four receptions and remains the only with a reception in all of FIU's games.

Padrick went 17-of-24 for 174 yards with one touchdown and an interception - which snapped a school-record streak of 91 attempts without an interception.

KSU took control of the game early in the third quarter when running back Thomas Clayton, who had total of 71 rushing yards last season, had an 80-yard touchdown run. Soon thereafter, he scored another touchdown from two yards out, following a 67-yard punt return, to make it 28-7.

Clayton led the Wildcats with a career-high 177 rushing yards for the game. Freshman running back Julian Reams had 15 carries for 40 yards in his collegiate debut. Overall, the Golden Panthers were held to just 82 net rushing yards.

The Golden Panthers would make it close again, 28-21, following two superb defensive plays. 

After a Johnathan Sturrup fumble recovery at the KSU 15-yard and a 12-yard reception by Eppinger, senior Adam Gorman pounded the ball into the endzone for another six points.

Antwan Barnes later blocked a punt which was recovered by Nick Turnbull and taken 17-yards to the endzone for yet another score.

"I'm proud of the fact that we fought right to the very end. We recovered a fumble in positive territory with about three minutes left in the game, which gave us a chance to score, but we didn't get it done. That shows me that our guys came to play," Strock said at the press conference.

FIU played in front the largest crowd it has ever seen, 43,611. The previous record was 21,010 when FIU defeated FAMU in the Orange Bowl last November.

"We have never played in front of a big crowd like this one," Padrick said. "It was totally different than playing in our stadium. The Big 12 has a lot going for them and it was great to play here, today."

He also expressed what his team got out of that game, despite it being a loss.

"What I think it really showed them was that they can play with teams like this." Strock said. "I am sure that their confidence level is up because they just went tooth and nail with a team that played big games in the BCS not that long ago."

The Golden Panthers go back on the road to play another Big 12 opponent, Texas Tech, on Sept. 10 in Lubbock, Texas. The game marks the Red Raider's season opener and another capacity crowd in expected.

When: Sept. 10 at 7:00 p.m.
Where: Jones SBC Stadium, Lubbock, Texas
TV: None
Radio: WKAT 1360 AM, WRGP 88.1 FM 
Record: FIU 0-1, Texas Tech 0-0


On offense, FIU will need to score early, primarily using their running ground. A strong performance on the ground (which was almost non-existent last weekend) will slow down the tempo of the game and limit scoring, which the Red Raiders aren't used to. A successful running game will also set up the passing game, which could use a couple of long play-action passes. And much like last week, they cannot get intimidated by the 50,000-plus fans that will be rooting against them. Kansas State's group of 40,000 did not fase them, so nothing should change in that aspect. 


On Defense, The Golden Panthers will need to stop Texas Tech's pass-heavy attack. Fifth year head coach Mike Leach's offense with test FIU defensive backs early and often. FIU's defense must use the same formula is used last week (save for those three disasterous minutes in the beggining of the third quarter). Kansas State's artificial turf caused many FIU tackling errors, so they must limit mistakes and, more importantly, force turnovers - like they did against Kansas State.

Headline: Women's soccer remains undefeated
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Homefield was not an advantage for the women's soccer team after a 0-0 draw to the University of North Florida. The scoreless game comes five days after a 1-1 draw to Stony Brook University and leaves the Golden Panthers without a win at FIU Soccer Stadium during the 2005 season. 

Lightning forced delays five-minutes before and 88 minutes into the Sept. 2 night game. Neither team could score in regulation, and two ten-minute periods of extra time also failed to produce a winner. 

There were no goals, but the game featured plenty of opportunities. FIU had 22 shots with 10-on-goal to North Florida's 10 shots with 6-on-goal. Strong defensive play and mistakes prevented those attempts from changing the scoreboard. 

"We outplayed that team 100 percent," forward Janet Liguori argued. "We need to work on finishing our chances because we should have beaten them."

The Golden Panthers failed to finish any of those chances, including a series of attempts in the 64th minute. While UNF goalkeeper Rachel Howard was on the floor from a previous save, freshman Kenisha Masters' shot was cleared by an Osprey defender. 

"The goalkeeper was lying down and we could have shot it to the other side of the goal," head coach Everton Edwards said about the incident. " When they should shoot, they don't. There are too many touches in the box."

The Ospreys also failed to finish key chances. In the second minute of overtime, Elizabeth Gowan almost scored on a free kick from 20 yards out, but wind carried the ball slightly above the left goal post.

When asked what type of adjustments could assure victory, Edwards replied, "If you score goals, you win games. You don't have to adjust." 



FIU 3, JSU 0 



The Golden Panthers added a victory to their undefeated record . After two consecutive draws, the women's soccer team earned its first win of the season by defeating Jacksonville State University 3-0 at home on Sept. 4. 

Janet Liguori set the tone for FIU (1-2-0) by netting her first two goals of the 2005 campaign. The senior forward led a Golden Panthers attack that out shot the Gamecocks (0-1-2) 17 to 6, just as head coach Edwards wanted.

"I told the team I'm tired of them coming out in games and playing after the first 20 minutes," Edwards said after the victory. "We knew [JSU] was a good team and we would have to go at them from the get go."

Go they did once Liguori struck in the 21st minute. After taking a pass from Tamara Kochen, Liguori banked a shot off the right goalpost to give FIU a lead they never would surrender. 

Janessa Taddei scored four minutes later by pouncing on a deflected balled. 

The senior forward raced away from defenders and sailed the ball into the right side of the goal to make the score 2-0.

FIU's defense held on to its lead by limiting Jacksonville State to three shots on goal, all of which were saved by Laura Snell. 

The transfer student from Auburn University recorded her second consecutive shutout and her first win as a Golden Panther. 

"I'm new to this system and we're quickly coming together," Snell said. "It's fun to finally get some goals put away."

Liguori secured FIU's victory with her second goal in the 88th minute. She guided Elizabeth Durozel's cross into the bottom-right corner to finalize a 3-0 win. 

FIU will next face Wofford College at the College of Charleston Classic, Sept. 9.

Subheadline: Conflict in the Gaza Withdrawal, both sides hope for better tomorrow
Author: German Silverio / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
August marked the beginning of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza strip. Both tension and anticipation couldn't run higher.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, defying many ultra-conservatives of his Jewish kin and a significant number of protesters, has made clear his decision to dismantle all settlements in the Gaza Strip. 

Along with the Palestinian authority, President Mahmoud Abbas has paved the way for the return of the territory to Palestinian control.

For those who have implied that the social conflict between these two groups is irremediable, this recent development has proven otherwise.

The Israelis and the Palestinians can work together, and with Yasser Arafat's absence, this has never been more obvious. 

Despite Arafat's pivotal role in the creation of a political machine, through which his people could negotiate with the Israelis, I find it convenient that he is no longer leading his people. 

The Palestinians needed someone new to run their governmental machine, and it appears that Abbas is just the man need to revitalize and run negotiations with the Israelis.

Joyous crowds gathered in boats along the Gaza strip coastline to celebrate the future withdrawal. Abbas, present during the congregation, told his people, "From here, our people begin the march towards establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital," and went on to give hope to a population ravaged by war, conflict and occupation.

On the Israeli side, feelings appear to be mixed, while Sharon has encountered some resistance to the withdrawal even from within his party. He has shown the needed determination to go through with his plans.  

Sharon has ordered any Israeli who remains settled in the Gaza Strip past the mid-August deadline, to be dragged out with military force. 

To much of his credit, he is not as futile and as favorable of the status quo as many believe. I had always thought that Arafat was the one stalling progress on the peace talks and now it appears circumstances are proving me right.

The Gaza strip, along with the West Bank, are two occupied territories which have been under Israeli control since the Six Day War in June 1967, and now have come to symbolize the struggle for independence by the Palestininans, who envision the two locations as their potential future state.

According to H. J. de Blijj and Peter O. Muller's book, "Geography: Realms, Regions, and Concepts," the total estimated Palestininan population - including those who have been displaced to foreign countries - stands at about 9.3 million (2003 est.), of which an estimated 1.3 are located in the Gaza strip. 

With that one, it isn't difficult to see why this upcoming withdrawal is such a grand victory for the Palestinians.

Now that the Israelis have made their move, it's up to Abbas to prove his worth. 

Depending on how well he excercises control over the Gaza Strip, along with reining in different Palestinian militant groups, we will see future developments take place in the relationship between these two nations. 

Despite finding himself in a compromising position, Abbas has satisfactorily promised and delivered.

Headline: The Day Disaster Struck
Subheadline: Bush fails to help hurricane victims on time 
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A disaster on the level of 9/11. There is no other way to describe the destruction and anarchy in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Thousands are dead, thousands more are homeless and there is widespread looting and corpses floating around the former heart of the city. There is speculation that New Orleans will never rebuild itself into the vibrant city it once was. If one isn't moved by the savagery of this disaster, they have no pulse. 

Unfortunately at a time when compassion and aid should be pouring out of every city, we are finding anger and questions. Anger at the frightening reality that the damage ensued from Katrina may not entirely be the result of an act of nature.

In 2004, the Bush administration killed a study by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to examine how New Orleans could be protected from a catastrophic hurricane. 

It's not like the possibility was unknown to the administration; in 2001, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) issued a report stating that a hurricane striking New Orleans was one of the three most likely disasters in the United States. The administration also cut New Orleans flood control funding by 44 percent in order to divert the money to pay for the Iraq war. It's tragic that our own government has assisted al-Qaeda and other terrorist cells trying to harm Americans. 

Without terrorists having to lift a finger, this administration allowed thousands of our own citizens to die because of its propensity to lie and inability to properly manage multiple operations simultaneously. 

National Guard troops are meant to assist in the recovery efforts during national emergencies. Instead of Louisiana and Mississippi troops being deployed into action at home, they were off maintaining a country that posed no threat to the United States; 35 percent of Louisiana and 40 percent of Mississippi National Guard troops to be exact.

The de-funding of our federal budget is as much a culprit in the catastrophe as any other factor. In 2004, the Bush administration cut funding requested by the New Orleans district of the Army Corps of Engineers for holding back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain by more than 80 percent. 80 percent! Where did that money go? You got it: The Iraq war and tax cuts for our nation's wealthiest one percent.

The pummeling that the Bush administration is receiving for its slow reaction to Katrina doesn't stem from political differences. Republican governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, Senator David Vitter (R-LA) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) are among the many blasting the government's slow reaction time. 

The day the storm struck the Gulf Coast, Bush was giving a speech in Colorado comparing the Iraq war to WWII and himself to FDR. The following day he met with business leaders in San Diego who are a major segment of his supporters. 

There was no standing on the remaining rubble addressing New Orleans through a megaphone with motivational words. Apparently, if those affected aren't ardent supporters, (which 57 percent certainly aren't) then putting the effort forth isn't worth the political points as it was in New York.

Was race a factor in the slow response? Not only are a majority of the victims African-American, but they're poor blacks. It's certain that the response would have been much swifter had Katrina struck in Beverly Hills or West Palm Beach. It sure wouldn't be politically beneficial to have the world looking on while affluent white folks wafted through dead corpses and human feces. 

To add insult to injury, such scenes of desperation have resulted in such headlines as "Third World America" in overseas newspapers. Some foreign governments have questioned America's strength while sharply criticizing the Bush administration's response. 

Among the foreign leaders offering aid are Cuba's Fidel Castro and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. They have offered doctors, fuel, tons of medical supplies, humanitarian aid and relief workers. It will be interesting to see whether or not Bush puts the needs of victims over politics and accepts the aid. Here's hoping he does.

This tragedy has affected us all, even if only through $3 per gallon gas. Surely many within our own FIU community have loved ones in the affected region and are praying daily for their safety. Let's do what we can to help in the recovery and rescue efforts. Even if it's just "filling the boots" of firefighters on street corners or donating to the Red Cross, these people have lost everything and need our help. 

As Bush rightly stated, the response of the federal government was "inadequate". We have the ability to help these poor souls just as they would do if we were in their shoes.

LOCAL:

Gas prices in South Florida below national average

A large shipment of fuel in the Panhandle Thursday is starting to level off gas prices across the state, according to a report by AAA Auto Club South.

The report also states that South Florida gas prices are still below the national average - reporting that the average price of gas in Fort Lauderdale was $2.901 on Monday, while the average is $3.057 a gallon around the nation.

U.S. gasoline production is down by about 40 million gallons a day, or 10 percent of consumption, according to analysts. Before Hurricane Katrina hit the region, the Gulf Coast accounted for about 30 percent of U.S. production. Much of the oil imported into the United States also made its way through the region before the storm.

Last week, Gov. Jeb Bush asked Floridians to save gasoline and energy in an effort to lower gas prices and conserve oil.


NATIONAL:

New Orleans still submerged; pumping stations put to work

Amid crisis and chaos, there are small signs of hope in the Big Easy. Crews began draining floodwaters out of New Orleans Tuesday after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers patched the levees that broke after Hurricane Katrina ripped through the region.

Officials say it could take up to 80 days to dry parts of the city. 

The levee system's failures left about 80 percent of the city flooded with water up to 20 feet deep. Officials say the water became toxic after mixed with chemicals, garbage, human waste and human remains.

Crews also continue to recover bodies of people killed in the storm. Officials say that over 70 are confirmed dead so far in Louisiana, but the death count could easily reach into the thousands.

In Mississippi, the death toll stands at 161, according to the state's emergency management agency, but is still expected to rise.

A plan to move some 4,000 evacuees from shelters in Texas to three cruise ships was postponed Tuesday because many of the people were not ready to move, officials said.

The chaos is taking a toll on police officers too. Last week, two officers committed suicide in New Orleans while dozens of others are turning in their badges.

Meanwhile, former President Bill Clinton said the government "failed" the people in the Gulf Coast by not moving fast enough in Katrina's aftermath. Clinton and former President George H.W. Bush joined forces to create a fund to help Katrina's victims.

Also, the six major television broadcast networks will hold a rare, joint telethon on Sept. 9 to raise money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The simulcast will begin at 8 p.m. and will be carried live on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox,  WB and UPN. The last time such a telethon aired was after the September 11, 2001 attacks on America. It helped raise about $130 million for the families of the victims.

Headline: University professors remember Justice Rehnquist
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who died on Sept. 3 due to complications from thyroid cancer, was buried in Arlington Cemetery on Sept. 7. His legacy as one of the longest serving justices was remembered with commemorative speeches from family, friends and an address by President George W. Bush.

Though Rehnquist - who had served 33 years as a justice and 19 years as chief justice - was known for his conservative leanings, some argue that his exact political positions cannot be easily pin-pointed.

"He had a very distinguished career," said Leonard Strickman, dean of the college of law. "He was very much a dissenter when he began and he led an activist court in striking down laws that were written by Congress. That's not a conservative thing to do for a court. Activism is the complete opposite of conservatism."

Strickman met Rehnquist in the 80s when the justice was invited to lecture at Northern Illinois University at a time when he was that school's college of law dean.

"There was a reception in his honor at my home, so I had an opportunity to spend a day with the chief justice which was very memorable," he said.

Thomas Baker, a professor in the college of law, was also acquainted with Rehnquist, having served as the chief justice's temporary administrative assistant in 1987.

"I admired and respected him as a person," he said. "He was one of the best bosses I've ever had."

Despite certain controversies that followed his career (such as a memorandum he wrote against desegregation for Justice Robert H. Jackson in 1952), Baker affirms that Rehnquist will be a personality remembered for years to come.

"He had a good sense of humor, wrote history books and studied painting," he said. "He knew many things. He was a truly historic person."

Meanwhile, as the nation remembers the justice's accomplishments and life, attention will also be drawn to the positions now left vacant in the court.

Bush nominated 50-year-old John Roberts to fill the chief justice position on Sept. 5, though the judge had originally been tapped to enter the slot left by retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.

"These spaces will let us see to what extent the president will be activated by his core, right-wing supporters," Strickman said.

Many Washington insiders have speculated that Bush may choose a woman or minority to fill the spot. Dean Strickman, however, gave his opinion as to whom he would like to see nominated.

"I would want to see Raul Cantero, justice of the Florida supreme court nominated, who is a conservative but highly regarded attorney, intellectually very strong and somewhat of an independent thinker," he said. "Still, he's certainly not a favorite in anyone's speculation right now."

Strickman agrees with Roberts' possible role as chief justice, stating that the decision "is the logical thing to do."

"If he had moved someone from the court, Bush would have had three positions to fill. That's why he didn't choose [Justice Antonin] Scalia," Strickman said. "[Justice Clarence] Thomas, due to the scandal surrounding his appointment, is too controversial; Scalia is too old and could be seen as extreme."

Many agree, though, that whoever is finally chosen to fill the slots will carry an administration under Rehnquist's shadow, who left a legacy of policies ranging from such issues as the nature of federalism, abortion, copyright laws and the death penalty.

"This is a very important time for the country, and the only person who knows what will happen is the president," Baker said. "There is now potential for a lot of change in an institution based on stability, and that means a lot."

Headline: Exchange students add international presence
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Jaime Hernandez, a senior studying international business, often gets complimented for his good English, even though he's not from the US.

"That's one of the reasons why I came to this country, to improve my English skills," he said with a laugh.

Hernandez was born and raised in Mexico and is currently attending the University of Colima. Though he has visited Florida before, he is enrolled in FIU for the first time through the school's International Student Exchange Program.

There are currently 17 students from all over the world taking classes at FIU this semester through the same program.

These students attend FIU as non-degree seekers and do not pay out-of-state tuition. Instead, they pay whatever tuition is charged by their home universities and can use their own system's financial aid to pay for their fees.

"We have students from various countries including Spain, England, Chile, Finland, Japan and others," said Laura Cronin, a coordinator for the Office of International Studies. "We're very happy with the numbers of people who have come in."

However, Cronin admits that the numbers could be higher.

"The only way we can accept more foreign students is if FIU sends out our own students," she said. "We had to put a stop to the people who wanted to come in because we didn't have enough of our students going out."

 Through the ISE, students in the US are able to travel to other countries and attend specific universities that have ties with FIU, such as the University of Belgrano in Argentina.

 According to Cronin, though, the interest in the program is minimal during the regular school year.

"We put out promotions and try to recruit whoever may be interested in the travels. But most of our students work one job or two jobs, and come to the school part-time. It might not be very good for them to take off for a whole semester," she said.

Besides the limits set by the balance regulations, Cronin also states that high expenses could also contribute to the lesser number of foreign students coming in.

"These students have to pay a mandatory insurance fee and have to pay for living on campus, which is also mandatory," she said. "And of course, the cost of living in Miami is generally going up."

Cronin did not think problems with immigration could be a factor in the lower numbers, though she did state that the time it takes to appeal for a J-1 visa - a requirement for foreign students - has increased.

"We had to rework our deadlines, but we're still helping students when they seek the visas at their embassy," she said.

Hernandez had some problems getting into the country, but he admits that it was worth it.

"A homeland security [officer] in the airport was really specific. He looked through everything, and that took a while," he said. "But I was happy when I was in Miami. I knew I would be in an environment full of international people and I was looking for that kind of thing."

Hernandez will be staying at FIU for only one semester and plans on doing another exchange program some day.

"Maybe I'll go to Germany or New Zealand. Miami's still great. I'm happy they told me about the program, and I'm going to like my time here, even if it's short," he said.

Cronin agrees that many students enjoy their time at FIU just because of the Miami setting.

"When we ask students why they chose to come here, they always say the weather," she said enthusiastically. "And Miami is just a big city that attracts people from other countries."

Though she enjoys working with these incoming students, she still wishes members of the FIU community would consider the program, allowing more foreigners to attend the university.

"They won't pay out-of-state tuition and their scholarships will cover everything. It's a great deal.

If our own students knew about programs like these that help make the school international, we'd have more success with other programs," she said.

For more information regarding international exchange, students are urged to visit their website at www.ois.fiu.edu.

Headline: Spotlight on:
Subheadline: Judo-Aikido Program
Author: Alejandra Serna /Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Mats cover the surface of the classroom. Lined up against the wall, students wait in seiza, the Japanese formal sitting position. As the sensei approaches, a volunteer follows to assist in the demonstration of a new technique. The volunteer rushes in with an overhead strike, which the sensei catches and uses to lead his opponent in a series of turns until his face finds the mat. And, so, class begins.

The Judo-Aikido Program began offering classes through FIU's Physical Education Department in 1994 with only three students. Today, it is the largest program of its kind in the United States.

The program's origins are in the chanceful meeting of Nestor Bustillo, the program's current activity director and adjunct professor, and Charles Bigger, faculty advisor to the Judo and Self Defense Club at FIU. The two worked together for years, volunteering in youth programs, before founding the Judo-Aikido Program.

Although only two martial arts are mentioned in the name, the program offers a broad selection of classes covering numerous disciplines. Bustillo, a third degree black belt in judo, took it upon himself to respond to student demand for specific types of courses such as Tai-chi, Karate, Capoeira and Aikido. In this way, the program is able to accommodate every type of student.

For instance, the program offers courses in competitive judo for the more aggressive. For those with more passive attitudes, Bustillo suggests Aikido.

"Aikido is non-competitive, geared to self-improvement of the individual and working cohesively," Bustillo said.

The variety also allows students to explore their interests in order to find the right fit. For example, junior Phillip Sossler has taken classes in Judo, Kempo, Taekwondo and Tai Chi before uncovering his passion for Aikido.

"The whole idea behind it appealed to my personality," Sossler said. "There is no fighting opposition, just finding a way around it."

For those students attracted to the broader scope of martial arts, not knowing which discipline to pursue, there is an Introduction to Martial Arts course. Essentially, this lecture class focuses on historical background and philosophy of several martial arts.

Unlike other university courses, the Judo-Aikido Program provides its students with numerous benefits outside the classroom. The FIU program is supplemented by student clubs, which coordinate extracurricular activities such as competitions and seminars.

"The seminars in particular are a great tool because they allow you to explore the art, learning all the different ways to apply each technique by working with so many people," said Adrian Valladares, a junior in public relations.

These organizations also help the program fight budgetary constraints and become self-sufficient. Through the sale of class uniforms, called "gi", and other fundraisers, they have purchased $30,000 worth of equipment over the past 10 years as well as contracted Tamiami Park for the use of its facilities.

Additionally, the program also offers students the chance at a career in the field. For those who develop a passion and true dedication, the program is happy to assist them in becoming instructors.

"I think teaching allows you to know whether you really know something or not," said Sossler, a third kyu, or green belt in Aikido, and also a student assistant in the program.

Although the steps are different for each art, the program readily covers the scope.

"Judo requires certification to teach, but others only require a certain level of experience, which the current instructors assess carefully," Bustillo said.

Once a student passes inspection, which depends on the type of martial art, the program also provides assistance in the job hunt.

"We have hired ex-students to become adjuncts or placed them in after-school programs," Bustillo said.

The study of martial arts also grants a series of less tangible benefits. Among these are the enhancement of social skills and personal confidence. In fact, students who originally start with intentions to learn to fight are "the least likely to engage in the type of activity," Bustillo said.

When talking about the program, Bustillo is most fond of its universal nature.

"This is a program that anybody can participate in, whether they have the abilities or not," he said.

Headline: Ozzy and friends rock the house in what may be last Ozzfest
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Broken noses, busted lips and people throwing up, all while someone screams through a 100,000-watt speaker system might not sound like a good time for most, but it definitely seemed like fun for over 10,000 metals heads on-hand for Ozzfest 2005 at the Sound Advice Amphitheater in West Palm Beach.

Whether it was watching any of the 20 bands perform, having bodies crash into you in a mosh pit, paying $8 for a beer, standing in torrential downpour or simply staring at topless women covered only by a $20 airbrushed design, there was something for everyone - which bodes especially well for an event that went from 9:30 a.m. until about 10:40 p.m.

The first 14 bands performed on the Hot Topic Second Stage, which was substantially smaller than the main stage and allowed standing room only for spectators. The major flaw in the Second Stage setup was that most of the bands had similar styles.

Therefore, if you didn't know any of the bands going in, it would sound like each band was performing the same song over and over again. Despite this, there were still many highlights to the Second Stage. A band named Bury Your Dead wins the award for most active crowd participation. Before their last song, they made the entire crowd - about 2,500 people - part down the middle and have the two sides run at each other as soon as the song began. 

It didn't turn out as bad as it should have; the only notable casualty from this imitation of a battle scene in "Braveheart" was a 110 lbs. teenage boy with a broken nose.

After Bury Your Dead performed, the heavy rains that annoyed some concert goers for most of the morning had almost completely stopped.

Another highlight - if only for the sheer unintentional comedy - was the performance of a band named Wicked Wisdom, which is actress Jada Pinkett-Smith's band. She probably cursed more in one song than her husband Will Smith has in his entire life. 

Musically, the band was surprisingly good; it was just the weirdness of seeing Jada Pinkett-Smith on stage as lead singer of a heavy metal band that kind of tainted the experience.

The second to last band to perform on the Second Stage, Killswitch Engage, also had the crowd going partially due to their lead guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz - dressed in Daisy Duke shorts and a pink tank top. Between songs he'd spit out one-liners that would make the crowd roar in laughter. 

His most notable line: "For this next song, I don't want girls to show their [breasts]. I wanna see some [expletive word for vagina]. So get up on some guy's shoulders and spread those legs."

The best performance on the Second Stage was the final act, Rob Zombie. Even though it wasn't a typical Rob Zombie show, which usually include pyrotechnics and flame-spitting robots, he still worked the crowd well. 

The crowd knew all of his songs and sang along accordingly. Also, before one of his songs, he instructed all the ladies in the crowd to climb on "some big dude's shoulders." But it was his guitarist, Jay-Five, who stole the show near the end with stunning renditions of the introduction solo to Van Halen's "Hot For Teacher" and the Star-Spangled Banner - played with his teeth.

Then it was off to the Main Stage, where the first three acts (In Flames, Black Label Society and Shadow's Fall) were more fit for the Second Stage due to almost non-existent crowd reaction. Some people in the lawn were actually napping during their performances.

Then came Mudvayne, who definitely had the most disruptive crowd reaction. 

The lawn of the Sound Advice Amphitheater is notoriously known for getting really muddy after it rains, but by the time the main stage was open, the lawn was already dry. 

Many people were apparently upset by this and decided they wanted to get themselves dirty by ripping up patches of grass and launching at one another. Not only did Mudvayne's hardcore sound fuel these actions, they also gave the vandals their vocal support and the flying sod continued until well after their set.

As the sun was setting, Velvet Revolver took the stage. Their hard rock seemed mellow in comparison to the other acts of the day, but they did get the crowd excited when the performed a cover of Stone Temple Pilot's "Dead And Bloated."  

In their usual concerts, front man Scott Weiland (formerly of STP), lead guitarist Slash, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Matt Sorum (all formerly of Guns N' Roses) play like it was 1992, but this time they didn't look too thrilled to be there. It also didn't help that their speaker volume was lower in comparison to the other bands.

 The concert concluded with a performance by Ozzy Osbourne with the original line up of Black Sabbath - guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward and bassist Geezer Butler. Ozzy still knew how to work the crowd, but during his first song, he sang a few notes off key. 

After the song, he explained in his almost indecipherable mumble, "I apologize for my bad singing there. I have a chest infection and the doctor told me not to do the gig. But I told him to f*** off!"

 Ozzy, in possibly one of his last performances, continued working the crowd by mooning them, dumping buckets of water on them and making them hum the beat of "Iron Man." Even though his stage presence was at about 30 percent of his former self, 30 percent of Ozzy is better than 80 percent of front men out today. Iommi's guitar playing shouldn't go without mention either. 

One solo lasted well over three minutes and had the crowd mesmerized as they looked at a close-up of his fingers on the big screen. It's hard to believe that a man with prosthetic finger tips can play the guitar that well.

In what was possibly the last Ozzfest ever, due to Ozzy's deteriorating condition, the only people who didn't have a good time were the Amphitheater crew that had to re-sod the huge part of the lawn that was ripped up.

Headline: COLLEGE POINTERS:How to get by
Subheadline: Tips to help you get through college without any major illnesses or injuries
Author: Michelle Ferrer / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
"I'm a freshman," you hear yourself saying. In high school, it meant you were the lowest of the low. 

You were at the bottom of the food chain. 

You were a frightened animal hiding from the scary sounds of the wild, but now you're in college. Now everything has changed and it's your time to shine.

You presently find that you're on top of the world. You would even go as far as saying you're awesome and  find yourself quoting Dave Chappelle by saying the occasional, "I'm [insert your name here], bitches" from time to time. Life is good, but for how long? 

Here's a comprehensive guide of college life at FIU to make things easier.


Death by music:

Never. Repeat after me, never go to the gym without an MP3 player, Walkman, or CD player. 

The music played there will make you want to either blow out your ear drums or run home crying to mommy.


"If it doesn't kill you, it will make you stronger":

Be prepared to eat some crappy food. Forget the Ramen noodles and canned food, The Fresh Food Company takes the cake for worst food in my book, except perhaps for their pizza. 

There pizza isn't too bad, but otherwise, why pay $7 for terrible, poorly made food? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you will at some point in your freshman year make your way to the Fresh Food Company. 

When you do, pray you don't get food poisoning like I did, and take some Pepto-Bismol. 

If you want to take the safer route, your best bet is to either eat somewhere off campus, visit the Pollo Tropical or Subway located on the first floor of GC.


"I want to be President":

During election time (mid-March) stay away from the Graham Center pit. 

Actually, stay away from GC in general, unless you enjoy being groped and for all intensive purposes, tied down by  candidates. 

They will follow you to your classes, as you buy a Snickers from the Panther Stop, as you make copies and, if they must, they'll even follow you home, but enough of that. 

When March rolls around, and someone says, "let's go to GC" you know what to do, quote the D.A.R.E. campaign, "just say no."


Turn, Smile, Shift, Repeat:

People always told me that friendliness was the best way to make friends and it is now that I realize it is so true. 

A smile goes a long way. All it takes to make a new friend is a friendly conversation with aclassmate.On that note, be nice to your teachers. Say "hello" and "Good morning/afternoon" every time you see them. 

Trust me, it goes a long way. It  also helps if you talk to them from time to time. 

Most teachers remember students who are friendly, and some go out of their way to help those students. When final grade time rolls around you'll be a name and a face instead of just a number. 


Don't drink and study:

It's no secret that most students like to have a couple drinks once in  while. That's fine, as long as you're 21 or over and if you're drinking in the right setting, like a party. 

But when you start showing up to class a bit tipsy, you should probably lay off the bottle for a while. 

Math is much easier when you're not drunk.So if you want your college experience to be all it could be. 

Be weary of these simple things and all will be well in this world we call college. You've been warned.
