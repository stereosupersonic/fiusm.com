Headline: Bay cleanup: a family affair
Subheadline: Campus unites to collect backyard trash
Author: Catherine Kaiman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Biscayne Bay is used to recruit prospective students to the Biscayne Bay Campus, which is why more than 80 people helped to clean it during the Day at the Bay event.

"When the Student Government Association sighted the bay and saw the trash and dirt, we knew that something had to be done," said Cassandra Andrade, vice president of the Student Government Council at BBC.

Day at the Bay was held Nov. 2 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the bay behind BBC's Hospitality Management building. More than 80 students, student clubs, faculty and local high school students attended the event while discovering where the bay is located on campus.

Day at the Bay was a collaborative effort among the Student Organizations Council, Student Programming Council and SGC-BBC. Baynanza, the Miami-Dade organization that cleans different areas of Biscayne Bay annually, donated T-shirts, garbage bags and bottled water for the event.

After a few hours of cleaning trash on the shore of the bay, many played frisbee and football while enjoying the natural surroundings of the campus. Free kayak rides were also provided to participants, courtesy of the  BBC Recreation Department.

David Fonseca, environmental affairs and community relations coordinator, had planned Day at the Bay since the beginning of the  semester. 

"It was a University-wide goal to bring awareness about the environment and recycling programs," Fonseca said. "This is one of the few SGA events ever to be held on a Saturday and the fact that we got so many people to show up at 9 a.m. is terrific."

Some BBC faculty and staff brought their families to the event in order to teach them about the importance of the environment.

Karen Baer, accountant for the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, regularly jogs with her husband and children around the bay and picked up trash along its shore. She said she was glad to help maintain the grounds of the campus.

"We like to come here with our kids and we want to see our campus be beautiful," Baer said. "We want to encourage the student population to recycle because we keep finding bottles."

Many participants of Day at the Bay offered suggestions for FIU to become more environmentally friendly.

"At our new gym, we should not have the lights on in the aerobics room when no one is in there. We should have some type of motion sensor lights to save energy," Sarah Hammill, distance learning librarian at the BBC Library, said.

Recycling was a concern that many students expressed.

"Half the stuff we found [on the bay] was just bottles and bottles, we really need recycling bins on campus that are labeled clearly," Shanell Middleton, a political science major, said.

Jason Geller, a journalism major, said he participated in the cleanup because after living in BBC's Bay Vista residential hall for four years, he noticed the excess trash around the bay. However, Geller does not believe that participation will make much of a difference.

"It's sad to say, but this is really pointless, even though it is a nice idea, the water is so polluted that everything is going to come back and wash ashore again. [We] really can't make much of a difference, with huge landfills and poor waste management, you could be driving a Hummer and not be affecting the enviornment as much because if governmental policies aren't changed, nothing can really be changed," Geller said.

 Angela Thomas, special events director for SGC-BBC, was pleased with the event's turnout and enjoyed spending the day outdoors.

"I think we [had] a great response, people are really excited about cleaning because it's our school. I personally enjoy it here because it is nice to sit by the bay and it's nice for it to not be filthy and to be clean," Thomas said.

Headline: Air guitar grows from fan ritual to competitive sport
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
If you were to watch David Jung perform for a crowd of thousands of adoring fans at a packed theater in New York City, watching every jump and every wild solo he breaks into, you wouldn't be able to help but feel something is missing, something that sets him apart from your typical guitar hero.

He's not missing any of the signature moves or flair for the dramatics, and aside from a Hello Kitty logo across his chest and a noticeable beer belly, the entire ensemble does not look out of place for a rock show.

What's missing is obvious, and the reason he's performing: Jung is perhaps the biggest star of the burgeoning competitive air guitar movement, which includes his biggest claim to fame, a US and World Air Guitar title in 2003 and his role as the star of the documentary film Air Guitar Nation.

 Next to throwing up the devil horns and drunkenly shouting "Freebird," air guitar is one of the most basic actions of any fan of rock music. While the act itself ranges in intensity from softly strumming like a member of a late 60's folk pop harmony duo to jumping around and head banging like late Metallica bassist Cliff Burton, the basics are the same no matter who is performing.

"It's like dancing, in a sense. You are playing along with a song, but it's also a way of pretending you are that person," said sophomore Mike Costa. 

At its most basic, air guitar is literally a form of mime. Merriam-Webster Dictionary dates the term to 1982, and describes it as "an imaginary guitar that one pretends to play." 

Along with Jung, who describes his style as aggressive, some of the other more well known competitors in the US Air Guitar Championships, which is held annually in New York City and for which there is a $1,000 grand prize, include 2007 champion William Ocean (whose dedicated fans call themselves the 'Waveriders') and 2006 champion Craig "Hot Lixx" Billmeier. 

Miami is a potential site for the 2008 U.S. Air Guitar National Tour.

The competition itself consists of each performer taking the stage one at a time and performing a song of their choosing for 60 seconds, while the judges grade them on a scale of 4.0-6.0 on three criteria. 

Some things participants are judged on include technical merit, or the raw abilities of the performer; stage presence, or how much the performer can command the audience's attention and lastly and most importantly, "airness," an intangible quality that each judge defines as they see fit. 

The last quality is the one that even the verbose, over the top air guitar championship's official rules cannot seem to pin down.

They finally settle, however, on "the extent to which a performance transcends the imitations of a real guitar and becomes an art form in and of itself."

It might seem silly for people to be glorified and honored for their ability to not play an instrument, but some students such as Costa don't seem to mind.

"I don't think it's goofy; no more so than a national Scrabble or Oreo stacking competition, which they actually have. It's something people enjoy doing, so why not crown someone?" said Costa. 

The way air guitar went from something that overzealous Who fans did in their bedrooms as a way to try and replicate Pete Townshend's infamous windmills, to something so ingrained in culture that it requires a national competition to settle the debate of who is the best, can be linked to pop culture.

One notable and memorable air guitar moment in pop culture includes Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, which features two slackers whose prowess at air guitar exceeded their own abilities in their band Wild Stallions, and which would eventually become a symbol for a George Carlin led society based on their music.

The idea of air guitar has even spawned an overwhelmingly popular video game series called Guitar Hero, which lets the player take control of a guitar shaped controller and attempt to win over a crowd by "playing" along to a song by hitting the correct buttons to correspond with the notes in the song.

"It is similar to the progression from something like a pet rock to a Tamogatchi," said freshman Stephanie Rodriguez. 

While it may not be considered a legitimate art form, it is hard to deny the influence air guitar has had on culture in this country; it is practically impossible to imagine going to a rock concert without seeing at least a few people doing their part to keep the proud tradition of air guitar alive.

"Say what you will about grown men prancing around on stage in costumes pretending to play music," said sophomore Natalie Levy. 

But in the end, is it all that different from a normal rock show?"

Headline: LATE NIGHT DINING OPTIONS: Food options abound at night
Author: Shannon Fallon / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A well balanced diet includes three meals a day, yet sometimes three meals are not enough. With mid terms and late study sessions in the library, hunger can often kick in. A night out on the town can be exhilarating, but when the music stops, hunger and perhaps a little dehydration can set in. 

These times call for what recent fast food advertisements for a certain Taco outlet have dubbed "The fourth meal." Long after dinnertime, and well before breakfast, a late night food stop can do the trick. 

Luckily for students, there is a wide variety of late night stops to grab a bite and keep the party going, and most are a short drive away from FIU.

Los Perros, a student favorite for late-night Colombian/Venezuelan food with a nightclub setting is conveniently located on 133rd and 42nd  St.. Los Perros offers a variety of arepas, burgers and hot dogs while listening to DJ-type house music. 

The restaurant is located in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you; the inside d&eacute;cor consists of club lights and a dance floor.

"I always go to Los Perros after a night out," said student Rodger Moreno. "It's awesome. I've never had their food sober, but when you're drunk, everything tastes great."

If the club scene isn't for you Los Verdes is another great Colombian hot dog stop, right off Coral Way and 133rd Ave.

Hot dogs are served with a special sauce, potato sticks and a small quail egg to top it off. You'll leave there full and happy like Lakeview housing resident Brianna Clark.

"The hot dogs are to die for; thinking about them makes me want one right now," she said.

If you feel lazy and hungry but don't feel like making the drive then Latin American Cafeteria is a great choice for late night dining. It's convenient location on 107th and Coral Way makes it easy for students to grab a Cuban sandwich, ropa vieja, pan con bistec, media noche, or just a cup of caf&eacute; con leche to get you through some late night studying. 

The 24-hour Starlight Diner, located off of Kendall Drive and 124th Ave. serves the late-night college crowd traditional meals including such as eggs, hash browns and pancakes along with staples like burgers and sandwiches throughout the night. The diner gives a fifties vibe and is fully stocked with a working jukebox. 

It also offers a full bar and fun activities such as karaoke on weeknights.  

"I love the milkshakes at the Starlight Diner, said sophomore Katie Paige. "I'll go there after a late night of studying with some friends and hang out and usually eat something light like a grilled cheese [sandwich]."

It is possible to become sick of the generic tacos from Taco Bell and ridiculous late-night lines. Roberto's Taco Shop, on Kendall Drive and 107th  Ave., alleviates this problem.

The taco shop is open 24 hours and offers made-to-order tostadas, enchiladas, chimichangas, quesadillas, burritos, tortas and tacos. Frosty Mexican beverages such as the cinnamon-almond-rice blend horchata, tamarind nectar and the hibiscus-flower derivative jamaica are the perfect thirst-quenchers. 

Breakfast includes a variety of breakfast burritos and combo plates that feature rice, tortillas and beans;  making for a tasty and filling first meal.

"The taco's at [Roberto's] are so much better than Taco Bell," said Taylor Prochnow a political science major. "They have real Mexican food and its all fresh and made right in front of you ... my favorites are the chicken burritos and the enchiladas."

So if it's 3 a.m. and you just have to get a burger or some chimichangas, there is no shortage of options to choose from; you just have to know where to look.

Headline: Student Government: Re-evaluation of councils questioned by SGC-BBC
Author: Nicole Acosta / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
The Student Government Council at University Park is supporting a restructuring proposal for Student Government Association; an idea proposed every few years since the restructuring of SGA about 16 years ago - and met with resistance from Biscayne Bay Campus' SGC every time. 

Arthur "AJ" Meyer, SGC-UP vice president, introduced the restructuring proposal during the Oct. 25 University-wide council meeting held at BBC.

Jonathan Doozan, SGC-BBC comptroller, thinks the proposal is being revisited now due to a potential correlation between Meyer's original SGA skybox proposal for the new football stadium and SGC-BBC rejecting it.

"I think it's possible that [SGC-UP] may have had the idea before just because they have the majority of the students down there and they have the majority of administration," Doozan said. "They are kind of the hub, we're kind of an appendage up here at BBC. Sometimes, it's kind of a pain to have to consider us in making decisions."

Kenny Gelok, SGC-UP chief of staff, was appointed to lead a UP committee through the re-evaluation process. If SGC-BBC decides to participate, it will more than likely form its own committee, according to Sergio Ibarra Bola&ntilde;os, SGC-UP comptroller.

Meyer said the committee would be structured separately in order to avoid the clashing of council members from either campus.

"In past years, generally, there is a clash between [SGC-UP and BBC and how are you supposed to benefit the student body when you have a clash among presidents and vice presidents of the same University?" Meyer said.

Meyer maintains that his proposal to form a committee to re-evaluate SGA comes from wanting to search for the best system possible.

However, Katiana Saintable, SGC-BBC president, said that the proposal to examine SGA's procedures is revisited often by UP councils despite not being constitutionally mandated.

"If something is working effectively, why stop a good thing?" Saintable said. "This is the same question we asked the administrators that we posed the question to - why is that something that consistently comes from the UP council?"

Meyer said that neither council could be sure what the end result will be and there just might be some "rough edges to smooth out." He also stressed that the evaluation proposal has nothing to do with SGC-BBC being considered ineffective.

"I'm basically bringing up the question to the executive board, the council and the student body: 'Is having two presidents for the same University who are essentially supposed to have the same power, but yet one is a Board of Trustees [member] and the other is a Board of Director's [member],"' Meyer said.

According to Meyer, this year's councils have worked together better than past councils. Saintable, however, wanted to know why Meyer would push for a "process of self-assessment" if he believes that the councils' relationship has improved.

"When [SGC-UP] brought this to our executive board, we decided that it would be a waste of our time, energy and manpower to work on something like this. We decided that it's more important to serve our constituents if we would focus our energy [and] resources on things that would benefit our students immediately," Saintable said.

Larry Lunsford, associate vice president of Student Affairs and University ombudsman, can recall the point in FIU's SGA history when there was only one student government for all FIU campuses.

Lunsford was serving as the director of student activities - which encompassed his role as SGA's advisor - when University President Modesto A. Maidique, in a letter sent to the council on February 1991, disbanded SGA. The dissolution, which was effective immediately, came as a result of "questionable uses of funds, poor record-keeping, massive numbers of senate resignations and difficulty in achieving quorum at senate meetings," according to Richard Correnti, then the vice president for Student Affairs, as quoted in the Feb. 26, 1991 issue of The Beacon.

Maidique's letter also called for an Interim Governing Council composed of students and advisors. 

IGC eventually unveiled a new constitution on Dec. 1991, according to a Jan. 7, 1992 issue of The Beacon. It proposed two separate but equal SGCs, one for UP and one for what was then called the North Miami campus. Each council would have 20 members and the Broward campus would be represented by one member of the North Miami Council.

The constitution would provide equal representation for both campuses, giving the North Miami campus more voice than it has received in the past. University-wide issues would be reviewed by the University council and, in the case of campus-specific issues, the respective campus' council may act alone and cannot be overridden.

There have been two SGCs since.

Lunsford said if the current proposed evaluation concluded that there should only be one student governing body again. The recommendation would go to Rosa Jones, the current vice president for Student Affairs, who would discuss the recommendation with Maidique.

Overall, Meyer said that he, Hernandez and Ibarra Bola&ntilde;os think this re-evaluation proposal is for the benefit of future councils.

"We want to make sure that future SGAs down the line are going to provide more and provide better to this University and the student body than we are now, that's the only way to succeed, so that's why we're looking into it," Meyer said.

Lunsford agreed.

"It's hard to speak with one voice if you have two voices that don't agree. All in all, it boils down to what's best for the student body," he said.

Headline: Young heroes break veteran mold: Soldiers discuss life changes after serving country
Author: Evelyn Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Every year, the soldiers respected for their patriotic sacrifices on Veteran's Day become younger and younger. 

As are the cases of Cadet Iulia Tanase and Cadet Michael Boyle; both full-time students at FIU and young veterans in the Iraq war. 

As veterans, Tanase and Boyle have learned to live their lives among the very people they protected while on duty. 

Tanase served five years of active duty in Iraq and is now an FIU  student majoring in psychology. While on active duty, Tanase enrolled as a part-time student on eArmyU.com to keep up with her higher learning.

EArmyU has 28 regionally recognized colleges and universities, which offer 145 certificate and degree programs. The program allows soldiers to receive credits, degrees and certificates at a low or no cost while on active duty. 

Dealing with basic training and the other obstacles soldiers encounter, Tanase admits that it has changed her, as it does most soldiers. 

"There are parts of you that change, like your mentality. It makes you grow up a little bit faster," Tanase said. "It gets in your blood." 

While Tanase found it peculiar to be called a veteran because she shares the common belief that veterans are older men and women, she admits that the change of becoming a civilian again is not a major one. 

"It does not change much. It is part of what you are, a soldier," Tanase said. 

For Boyle, being a soldier is also a part of who he is. 

When in uniform, he enjoys the feeling he gets when people around him thank him for his service.

Boyle was on active duty for three years in Iraq and inactive for two years. 

His college education started at Miami Dade College. He is now attending FIU and majoring in political science.  

"Adapting to college is like adapting to any other job," Boyle said, who believes that the military kept him out of trouble as a young adult. "The army has kept me busy and I could still be adventurous." 

Boyle takes what he has learned from the army and lives by it every day. 

"Try to live your life as if you have an audience in front of you," Boyle said.

Headline: LATIN AMERICAn AND CARIBBEAN CENTER: Center greets new,  heralded director
Author: Xavier E. Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Cristina Eguiz&aacute;bal joined FIU as its new director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center. 

Eguiz&aacute;bal, who has over three decades of experience working within international relations, is LACC's third director in its 28-year history at FIU. The former FIU guest professor has dedicated most of her life to the study, teaching and funding of Latin American and U.S. relations.

"LACC is a very prestigious center. It has very high visibility and is well-regarded among the Latin American academic community," Eguiz&aacute;bal said, who has been a program officer at the Ford Foundation for the past 10 years. 

The Ford Foundation is a nonprofit, charitable organization created to fund projects that reduce poverty and promote international understanding. 

"I think LACC's prestige comes from their public policy and turn toward society and business," Eguiz&aacute;bal said.

At the Ford Foundation, Eguiz&aacute;bal was in charge of administering a portfolio that gave grants of up to $4 million a year for projects geared toward improving Latin American and U.S. relations. As program officer, she provided funding for institutions like FIU's Cuban Research Center and the Inter-American Dialogue. 

She also helped create the Centro de Studious y Programs Inter Americanos (Center of Inter-American Studies and Programs), an international relations fellowship program, at the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology).

Despite her many accomplishments with the Ford Foundation, her former colleagues admit her talents may be better spent in academia rather than philanthropy.

"This is a very good place to be at for her career.  In an academic atmosphere, she'll really be able to apply her analytic and writing skills," said Peter Hakim, president of Inter-American Dialogue, Washington D.C.'s premier think tank on Latin American affairs. 

He's known Eguiz&aacute;bal for over 15 years and says they've had many long conversations discussing ways to improve diplomatic relations.

"She has a great sensitivity toward the people and politics of the region because she was raised in it," Hakim said. 

Her plans for LACC include developing student or faculty exchange programs and joint courses with universities in Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two largest countries. She also wants to initiate more cross-regional work within FIU by linking and collaborating LACC with the Asian and European studies.  

She wants to examine issues that can be looked at through the prism of different regions such as trade and violence.

According to Eguiz&aacute;bal, due to growing globalization trends there needs to be a worldwide attitude in how academics study the region. 

"It's important to understand how Latin Americans view the rest of the world because everything works globally now," Eguiz&aacute;bal said.

Headline: Military officials find new meaning to Veteran's Day
Author: Evelyn Diaz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Major Luis Fuchu has served with the military for ten years. He fought in Iraq in 2003 and 2005. Fuchu now works in the Department of Military Science in FIU. 

"I have been blessed with the opportunity to lead. Now I am twice blessed to coach and mentor these students," said Fuchu about working with FIU students. 

Fuchu's military career began while he was in college, when he joined the Army ROTC with a friend. His life soon changed.

"It felt good to be part of something. They counted on me and I on them. Coming from the streets, that meant a lot," Fuchu said. 

As Veteran's Day gets closer, Fuchu plans to celebrate the holiday by remembering the soldiers who served before him.

"On Veterans Day I think a lot of those who came before me. I respect them. I think of those who did the ultimate sacrifice. I now understand that they did the ultimate sacrifice for a reason," Fuchu said.

MSG Tyler Doughty has served for seventeen years and is still active in the military service. While at combat, Doughty became injured and received two purple hearts while serving in Iraq. He now works with FIU in the ROTC department. 

Doughty said his idea of veterans changed when he became one.

"Before I was in the military, I thought it was the ones who retired and served for the military that were the veterans. I believe now it means a whole lot more," said Doughty.

Sergeant William "Patrick" Miller served twenty years in the military. He has been in combat in Panama, Iraq and Afghanistan. Miller has been working with the ROTC department in FIU for three years.

The meaning of Veterans Day has also changed for Miller since serving for the military.

"Veterans Day has more of an impact. It is more significant as a soldier," said Miller. 

Miller believes that the rest of the country should also appreciates the holiday, especially since the U.S. is at war. Doughty and Fuchu agree.

"I think the country as a whole is very supportive," Fuchu said.

Fuchu acknowledges that the soldiers who serve the U.S. are indeed the best.

"United we stand is the only way we do it; it can't get any better," Fuchu said.

Headline: Editorial: Motives behind proposal unclear
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
At the University of Florida, each student pays $28.50 in fees for their Athletics program according to a Dec. 22, 2006 Miami Herald article; UF has won three national championships in the past three years. University of Miami students pay $26 in fees for their Athletics department, and they have won several championships throughout their storied history. 

Each FIU student pays $184.90 in Athletics fees, and unlike those departments, our Athletics department is best known for being unknown. 

 In a proposal labeled "The Partnership," the Student Government Council at University Park is pushing for a deal that would give $90,000 to the Athletics department in exchange for the use of a skybox and various venues around campus including the Pharmed Arena and the new Football Stadium among them. These venues were, until recently, available for student activities free of charge.

The current proposal is an evolution of the initial proposal, which did not include the use of any of these venues and would have cost an additional $30,000. The Athletics department had no qualms with allowing student organizations to use these spaces for free, but after a "restructuring," the department suddenly has a problem with continuing this practice. 

The first proposal only included the skybox and was substantially more expensive. After the proposal was reevaluated to include the use of the other facilities, the price dropped.

The reason for adding the use of these venues is seemingly obvious. Instead of having to gain support for a $120,000 proposal for a skybox alone, SGC-UP can claim that this proposal is not  really about a skybox at all; it is about paying for the use of other facilities. 

Only now can this deal be called a "partnership," instead of what it is: an attempt by SGC-UP to spend $90,000 on a skybox that, no matter how you look at it or raffle the tickets, can only benefit a maximum of 120 students.

By adding some previously free items to a $90,000 proposal, Athletics and SGC-UP can make it seem like a better value. This tactic is reminiscent of a late night infomercial, trying to entice you to buy a certain product by including several other products as added bonuses. 

Most of the time, however, those add-ons are worthless and nothing more than a cheap sales ploy. In this case, Athletics was so generous that they even knocked off one easy payment of $30,000.

The fact that students have to pay for the use of public facilities their fees and tax dollars paid for is preposterous. Yet what ultimately makes this move by Athletics so outrageous is the fact that, according to Robert Frye, director of Recreation Services, the department has yet to pay for the use of several facilities operated by Student Affairs, such as the racquetball courts, the BBC Aquatic Center and the intramural sports field for football practice. 

It seems as if the only people who w­­­ould benefit from this proposal are a handful of students and the Athletics department. 

It bears noting that the most vocal advocate of this proposal on the council is its vice president, Arthur "AJ" Meyer who, interestingly enough used to work for the Athletics department as a marketing coordinator. When asked if he thought this was a conflict of interest, Meyer said: "It may be a conflict of too much love for different entities of the University."

In a year when budgets are being cut and departments are struggling to simply fulfill their obligations to students, one has to wonder why Athletics is receiving such special treatment.

Headline: Letter to the Editor #1: Athletics partnership fiscally responsible, will save students money in long run
Author: O. Bill Buchanan III / Director of Internal Affairs, SGC-UP
&nbsp;
The Beacon has misrepresented the issue of the Student Government Association/Athletics partnership using it as a cornerstone for a personal attack on those working diligently for the betterment of the University.  

The lack of factual information listed in the article, along with the omission of key aspects of the proposal that benefit the student body, has framed an argument that is unfair.  

The Athletics partnership does a great deal of good for University Park students. 

Currently, the Student Government Council at UP has a contractual agreement for three free arena usages in each fiscal year but due to new management, and Athletics restructuring, this contract will become null and void after this year.  Therefore, each of these usages would cost a total of $9,000 in Activities and Service fees.  

This partnership guarantees events such as: Dance Marathon, Homecoming Panther Prowl and the SPC Spring concert.

Not only are the arena usages saved in this partnership but also the SGA gains the usage of the football stadium three times a year, a $22,500 value. 

These usages alone cover the $30,000 a year investment, not to mention the addition of the FIU baseball stadium and donors club as well.  While every student may not take advantage of the opportunities that this investment will provide, it is not the fault of the SGC-UP; SGC-UP can only provide the student's with the best programming available in the most fiscally responsible manner.  

If the rental fees of all of these venues are added, one would see that the partnership between the SGA and Athletics saves the students $16,500 a year in activities  and service fees.  

The purpose of the skybox was well described in the presentation given in the council meeting, yet the article and editorial fail to mention that seats will be raffled to students who attend home games, given to those recognized by the University for scholarship and those students who have had great accomplishments. 

For The Beacon to frame this as an entitlement measure for the SGA is not fair.  As for the statement that students pay an Athletics fee and should not pay to use these venues: this is incorrect.  While it may be a source of overall budgetary contention, it is a fact that student organizations have to rent these venues each time they have an event, costing each student even more in Activities and Service fees than the proposed $30,000 per year. Therefore, it is actually fiscally responsible and not a frivolous waste of funding.

Headline: Letter to the Editor #2: SPC's Hispanic Heritage events fall short
Author: Gabriel Rodriguez / Junior / Business Major
&nbsp;
After reading the article "Events raise cultural awareness, interest" I was moved to express my opinion regarding the state of the Hispanic Heritage Celebration at FIU this year, particularly that at University Park. 

I was completely surprised to read that there have been events throughout the month of October celebrating Hispanic Heritage, since there has been no effort from the Student Programming Council to properly promote these events. I have not seen any events that showcase the eclectic richness of the Hispanic culture. 

They really missed the target this year. In past years, Hispanic Heritage events have been unavoidable. 

It is impossible to miss the music, food and student interaction at the events. Where has all that been this year? 

Another thing I found ridiculous is what Michelle Oria, vice president of external affairs for SPC at UP said, "When most people think of Hispanic Heritage they think of Cinco de Mayo." Who exactly considers Hispanic Heritage to only encompass the celebration of Mexico's independence? 

The only event I saw promoted was their dinner and a movie - which I saw posters for on the day of the event. The event took place on the same night as, "A Night For Molly," which is a fund-raising dinner for a FIU student who was struck by a drunk driver. 

It's incredibly irresponsible of them to plan an event that offered free food on the same night as an event that was offering students dinner in exchange for monetary donations. The dinner and a movie should have been held on a different night as to not conflict with the philanthropic event. It's just not right.

The point is that, regardless of the claim that events have been held throughout the month of October, students have not noticed. They have been unaffected by this year's 'festivities.' If there have been Hispanic Heritage events and no one is around to notice or participate, has the culture been represented properly? The answer is no.

Headline: MAKING THE PASS: Energetic point guard sparks women's team
Author: Andrew Julian / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It happened one December day last year, 17 points and eight assists, while she wore a pair of knee-high black socks. Point guard Iva Ciglar had her highest assist total in a game in which she led her team to a convincing win. 

The 5-foot-7 junior, finished the season averaging 5.9 assists per game, which led the Sun Belt conference and was 13th in the nation.

Nearly 11 months later, Ciglar is concerned with only one thing - winning.

"What gets me going, man, is that I hate to lose," said Ciglar, who also earned third team All Sun Belt Conference preseason honors.

The acknowledgement from the conference of her accomplishment is of only marginal importance compared to winning the Sun Belt Conference title to Ciglar.

"I'm very flattered," Ciglar said. "It's a very nice acknowledgement, but it doesn't mean much." 

Her attitude is what makes her the an example to lead by.

At practices, the second year starter, who averaged a team-leading 36.5 minutes per game last year, shows passion and emotion, perhaps more than anyone on the FIU team.

Constantly vocal and always encouraging her teammates, Ciglar has evolved into one of the real team captains.

"I hope they see that and will follow me, and I like being someone my younger teammates can look up to," she said.

 Being a leader, however, isn't just about getting teammates fired up. Sometimes, it's doing the little things that give the team the edge and that starts with preparation. 

"If you don't go hard in practice, you're going to lose," Ciglar said. "And how you practice is how you play the game." 

Ciglar is always jumping at opportunities to get better, whether it's going over film in her spare time, or getting in extra shooting after practice, which she does at least three days a week.  

Over the past 12 years, basketball has become such a key part of Ciglar's life that it's hard to imagine not playing it. 

When asked what she would be doing if she wasn't playing basketball, she responded swiftly. 

"I don't even want to think about that," she said.

The question made her reminisce of a moment when not playing basketball ever again was a big possibility.

Ciglar had surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament in her knee in 2002.

"It was when I got injured that other schools started turning me down," she said.

 Coach Cindy Russo stuck with the 2001 European Championship Bronze medalist from Velika Gorica, in North-Central Croatia, and she now has, arguably, the finest distributor in the Sun Belt Conference. 

It is from home that Ciglar draws her biggest inspiration, her father, who doubled as her first coach. 

"I trust my dad with almost everything he says," Ciglar said. "He really means it, because he only wishes me well."

As a child, Ciglar was around practice before she could barely hold a basketball.

"I remember running around the gyms all the time," she said. "We played with a men's ball and I was six or seven years old. I tried to start, but my dad realized I was too small."

It wasn't for another few years that Ciglar got her chance to finally play organized ball.

"I finally got started when I was 10; when I could finally shoot the ball," she said.

She stresses how her basketball career would not be possible without the most beloved people in her life.

 "Without family, I wouldn't be here where I am right now without their support," Ciglar said. "This has been really hard for me to be away from my family for so long." 

Tearing an ACL, being named to the All Sun Belt Conference team and moving halfway across the world to go to school is a short chronology of Ciglar's life the last few years.

 She now prepares to be an important player of one of the most successful mid-major women's basketball programs of the past 20 years. 

The finance major is no stranger to adversity as she has become accustomed to finding ways to succeed.

"I know even when things get tough, I can make my way because I'm like that," she said. "I was raised like that."

 Saying that things will get tough this year for the women's basketball team might be an understatement with several NCAA tournament and WNIT participants from last year on the schedule, including DePaul, Florida State and Georgia.

In addition, the team will face Sun Belt Eastern Division foes Middle Tennessee and Western Kentucky.

As confident a player as the Golden Panthers have, high hopes are prominent among the women's basketball team. 

The season opens Nov. 9 against Lynn University and Ciglar will be there, leading her team once again in knee-high black socks.

Headline: PROFESSIONAL DREAM: Junior imparts experience to young squad
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
When FIU alum and Orlando Magic point guard Carlos Arroyo led the Puerto Rican National team to victory against the United States in the 2004 Olympics, current Golden Panthers' forward Alex Galindo ran his mouth.

"I was talking trash to all my teammates," Galindo said.

His teammates were players from the University of Kansas, but before he played for Kansas, he left his home country and family to improve his basketball skills. 

At the age of 17, Galindo's drive to play at a higher level in the United States led him to move from his hometown of Mayaguez, Puerto Rico to St. Benedict Prep in Newark, NJ.

The transition from the Caribbean island to the United States was difficult for the teenager.

"It was tough not speaking English, and I was homesick, but I fought through it," Galindo said.

He made the decision to move the United States on his own. His parents supported their son's wishes, but they never pushed him to play basketball or to live in the U.S. He had to overcome the trial and tribulations he placed on his own shoulders.

Another current NBA player would assist relieving the weight off Galindo's shoulders. Denver Nuggets' guard J.R. Smith's family hosted Galindo while he was playing at St. Benedict Prep.

"My host family helped me out a lot," he said. "Me and J.R. just clicked from the beginning; we always played against each other in a lot of one-on-ones."

In addition to Smith's family filling a void, the large Hispanic community in Newark provided some comfort to Galindo.

"You know, it's nice to see and hear people you can relate to," he said. "It made me feel like I was back home."

After attending St. Benedict Prep for two years, he attended the University of Kansas from 2004-05, but he opted to transfer to FIU where he would play more minutes and play under coach Sergio Rouco, whom he met when he was 16 years old.

"I wanted to show coach my abilities and I felt comfortable playing for him," Galindo said.

But Galindo would have to wait an entire year, sitting on the bench as a redshirt transfer, before he could contribute to the team. The long wait taught him patience and allowed him to learn as much as he could before stepping foot on the court.

"I learned to watch the game from a coach's perspective," he said. "I also learned to let the game come to you. When you force things, then you start to suffer."

As a result of his first season, Galindo has taken fellow countrymen and Florida State transfer Josue Soto under his wing.

This 2007-08 season, Soto finds himself sitting out the whole season just like Galindo did during his first year at FIU. 

"He tells me to pay attention and work hard during this first season," Soto said. "We're still like brothers, always joking in Spanish."

Despite their brotherly friendship, back in Puerto Rico, Soto thought Galindo had a big ego. He was surprised to find out Galindo is modest despite possessing talent.

"I thought since he was his team's superstar that he wasn't humble," Soto said. " I just look at his work ethic now and I see why he is so good."

Galindo's work ethic was revamped during the summer of 2005, the summer prior to him arriving at FIU, when he was given the opportunity to tryout for the Puerto Rican National team. 

"I learned to play with men," Galindo said. "They taught me what can happen when you work hard enough." 

He would see former Golden Panther Arroyo at the pre-selection where Galindo's hopes of playing professional basketball were amplified.

"The trip just gave me more aspirations of making it to the NBA," he said.

Galindo didn't make the team, but he left the pre-selection with tools he is using this upcoming season. But he will tryout again this upcoming summer.

During the off-season, he evaluated his strengths and weaknesses and worked diligently to improve his jump shot, quickness and defense.

His dream is to emulate his childhood idol, Scottie Pippen, because of Pippen's overall game. 

"I want to be able to do everything as a player," Galindo said.

The 2007-08 season will be Galindo's second full season playing for FIU. With the addition of big men Russel Hicks and Badara Ndiaye, Galindo expects his perimeter shooting to improve vastly.

He also expects to be the leader of this season's squad, with some teammates looking up to him because he comes from a big time college program. 

"I think he's the captain of the team because of how he talks to people," Soto said. "Even when somebody messes up, he doesn't yell, he just tells them how to get better." 

As Galindo leads the Golden Panthers throughout the 2007-08 season, he wants to some day be able to play against the man who drove Puerto Rico past the United States and the man who provided him with family as an impressionable teenager.

"Yeah I wouldn't mind playing against J.R. again," Galindo said, "but on the NBA court."

Headline: Basketball Preview: Women look to win Sun Belt with new contributors
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The women's basketball team has undergone a lot of changes since last season, losing previous starters. This year's team is a lot younger and less experienced, but is fairly deep and will look to challenge for a Sun Belt Conference Championship and a birth in the NCAA Tournament in March.   

This season's schedule is laden with talented opponents like Florida State, DePaul, Middle Tennessee State and Miami. 

The players are ready to face elite opponents this season.

"[Miami is] always a tough one," said junior point guard Iva Ciglar. "Middle Tennessee, they beat us bad and we would like to get back at them. We have a tough schedule, so every game is going to be really exciting and I am looking forward to it."

It is uncertain at this time who exactly will be FIU's starting five when the 2007-08 season tips of Nov. 9 against Lynn University. The team's only returning starters from last season are Ciglar and LaQuetta Ferguson. 

"It could be anybody," coach Cindy Russo said. "Potential starters could be Marquita Adley, Jasmine Jenkins, Elisa Carey, LaQuetta Ferguson, Asha Neal and Iva Ciglar." 

Senior guard Ferguson is FIU's number one scoring threat this year. Last season, Ferguson averaged a team-high 15.4 points per game. She is also a preseason first team All Sun Belt selection. Last season, Ferguson took center stage in a 83-78 win over the University of Miami when she scored a career-high 28 points. Coming into her final season, Ferguson is confident that her experience will lead to success on the court. "I think it makes me better prepared. I got a lot of people to pass the ball to and they will put it in the basket."

Red-shirt senior guard Asha Neal will start her fifth season with the basketball team this year. Neal will likely be looking to play a bigger role with the team this season and rekindle memories of her sophomore season when she played in 29 games, starting in 28 of them. Aside from that season, Neal has only started three times. This season, coach Russo said that it is possible for her to get into the starting rotation again.

Ciglar ended last season as the leader in assists for the entire Sun Belt Conference with 5.9 per game. Like Ferguson, Ciglar comes into this season with a preseason accolade under her belt, having received third team All Sun Belt honors. Ciglar will likely handle the point guard duties and should lead the team in minutes played after going a full 40 minutes 13 times last season.  

Junior forward Marquita Adley is one of FIU's more polished returning players and could contend for the team and Sun Belt lead in rebounds. 

Last season Adley played in every game, averaging eight points and 6.3 rebounds per game. Adley had an outstanding high school career at Monsignor Edward Pace where she averaged 19 points, 17.5 rebounds and seven blocks per game. Her hustle play off the bench last season made her a standout.

Sophomore guard Monika Bosilj played in all of FIU's games last season as a freshman and averaged 5.1 points per game. 

Bosilj's standout game was against North Florida when she scored 23 points on 9-for-15 shooting, with three shots from behind the arc.  

Sophomore forward Elisa Carey could be a candidate for this years most improved player. Carey is one of the tallest players on the team and is an excellent rebounder. 

Last year as a freshmen, Carey only averaged 1.6 points and 1.4 rebounds per game in 16 games. However, this year a great improvement is expected as she scored 11 points and grabbed 16 rebounds against Barry in a exhibition game.

This season's team is also equipped with a very strong incoming freshmen class. Maja Krajacic is a 6-4 center and comes in as the tallest player on the team.

 So far Krajacic has really impressed her teammates and the coaching staff with her size and skill in the paint. 

Fanni Hutlassa comes to the team from Hungary where she had a decorated prep career. 

Hutlassa was a part of five national championships, a two-time MVP and a 3-point shooting champion. Tabitha Drake is a local product out of Monsignor Edward Pace.

 Drake was a two-time first team Miami Herald All-Dade selection in high school when she averaged a double-double with 12.5 points and 14.5 rebounds per game. 

FIU may have lost 2005-06 First-Team All-Sun Belt Conference center Lasma Jekabsone to graduation, but her little sister Liene Jekabsone joins the squad this season. 

The younger Jekabsone was an accomplished player in Europe and was a part of Latvian championship team four times. 

Russo will begin her 29th season with FIU. In her coaching career, Russo has been a consistent winner. Russo's overall career win percentage is an impressive .696 and her overall record is 609-266. 

She hopes to use her 29th season as a stepping stone to obtain another Sun Belt Conference title with a balanced and complete roster.

Headline: Basketball Preview: Men hope to bounce back following a subpar year
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As soon as a disappointing 12-17 campaign came to an end last season, the men's basketball team was already feeling optimistic about this year's potential. 

Coach Sergio Rouco is back at the helm this year with a young squad that is ready to shock everybody but itself. 



Point Guard



Once again, the 5-foot-9, lightening quick Mike James should secure the starting point guard spot. After playing passive early in the season last year, James came along late in the season and wreaked havoc on the opposition. With more weapons than ever before, his modest 2.89 assists per game should boost to well over five this year. Also, his ability to penetrate and burst through zone defenses makes him a tough cover for anyone. 

His quick first step should create more than enough opportunities for his new running mate, the athletic Kenneth White. James will have to play well in his final year with back up Erick Nsangou vying for playing time. The 6-foot, 195-pound Cameroon native who averaged 5.3 points per game in just over 17 minutes of action per game in his freshman season should get even more open jumpers this time around. Redshirt Freshman Nick Taylor will look to push the two guards as he also vies for a spot in the rotation. 



Shooting Guard



In his senior year, Johwen Villegas was arguably the most consistent member of the Golden Panthers last season. The man looking to fill that void at the two spot is a very capable Kenneth White. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound guard made his mark as a lethal outside shooter with Texas A&M last season. With no Acie Law IV ahead of him in the lineup this season, look for White to showcase the offensive ability that makes him so coveted. 

White has a good mid-range jumper, but his athleticism and fearlessness adds to his appeal. With a saturated point guard slot, look for hometown favorite Tremayne Russell to see time at the two spot. The crafty freshman averaged 20 points per game in his senior year at South Dade High School and can fill it up from all over the court. 



Small Forward



Although he is listed as a guard, senior Chris Fuller fits well at the small forward position. The 6-foot-5, 209-pound lefty has a tireless work ethic, good rebounding ability and a willingness to take on the toughest defensive assignment every game - drawing comparisons to former Golden Panther Raja Bell. 

His 31.2 minutes per game led the team last season and his career-best 10.7 ppg average should increase as the team looks to run more.

 Last season, he extended his range to the three-point line and should attempt even more this season. Sophomore Cedric Essola, who played with confidence towards the end of the season, should allow Fuller some rest at the small forward spot. 

At 6-foot-8, 210 pounds Essola can use his long, thin frame to block or alter shots in the paint.

Power Forward



Thanks to offensive juggernaut Alex Galindo, the four spot is the one that coach Rouco and the Golden Panthers should be least worried about. Last season, Galindo became the 50th Golden Panther ever to score 300 points in a single season (13.9 ppg), notching a series of buzzer beaters, game winners and highlight worthy plays along the way. 

Rumor has it that he worked on his jumper even more over the summer, so look for defenders to be at his mercy once again. Sophomore forward Nikola Gacesa should also get time at power forward. Gacesa's rebounding and high basketball IQ should help the team out a lot once again.



CENTER

Attention, Golden Panther fans. Finally, this year's team will not be drastically undersized at the center position. The 7-foot, 250-pound Russell Hicks will give a much needed face lift to what has been the weakest position for the Golden Panthers in recent years. 

The Pepperdine University transfer has a soft touch and is expected to be the force in the middle that FIU fans have been waiting for. 

But wait, there's more. Joining Hicks at the revamped center spot will be Badara Ndiaye, a 6-foot-11, 225-pound transfer from Southeastern Community College in Iowa.

 Ndiaye, who played basketball, soccer, and volleyball in his native country of Senegal, will look to flourish in Rouco's system with basketball as his only focus. 

Together, the two big men should turn away the smaller guards that lived in the paint against the Golden Panthers last season.

The team opens the new season with a seven-game home stand starting Nov. 12 against Florida Tech. Considering that almost half of the team are newcomers, chemistry might be the biggest challenge for the Golden Panthers early in the year.

 James has to be assertive at the point and make all of his weapons happy. Galindo has to be more aggressive than ever and the entire team has to follow Fuller's lead on the defensive end to be successful.

 If the team can stay healthy and buy into Rouco's system, this may be a season to remember.

Headline: Senior considered for 'Best New Artist' Latin Grammy
Author: Christopher Necuze / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Alejandra Alberti, a senior majoring in marketing, is up for the Latin Grammy for Best New Artist after the release of her first, self-titled album. Despite her busy schedule, Alberti found time to sit with The Beacon to discuss her life-changing nomination and future.



Q: How did your parents influence you?

A: My parents were musicians. I would hear them singing in the house all the time. 

I would be the only child in the house hearing them playing and singing.





Q: When did you get into music?

It wasn't until college that I actually began to take music seriously. I knew I wanted to graduate with my marketing degree, but I knew 

I wasn't going to be happy when I left so I decided to take singing lessons. From there, I went to the studio where I started working with a producer and we started writing. 

We came up  with like 30 or 40 songs and from there we chose the 10 we produced for the album. From then on  it's been non-stop promotion for the album.



Q: What was your main inspiration for you album?

A lot of things, from relationships to other people's experiences. My first single is about my aunt going through her divorce. It's mostly personal experiences. 

I just feel that these songs mean more. People are going to know that you went through that experience. When people open up the album and read the lyrics, they're always interested [in knowing] why I wrote a particular song or why I'm sad or happy. It keeps people interested, knowing that it could possibly happen to you.



Q: Which artists in particular have influenced your music?

My music has a great deal of Anglo and Spanish influences. In Spanish music, I listened a lot to Mana and mostly a lot of rock artists. 

On the Anglo side, I listen to The Cure, Coldplay, U2, 311 ... When I was young I loved Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. So I have a little bit of everything, I have the rock side and the R&B side.



Q: Were you surprised when you heard that you received the Grammy nomination?

Of course, I mean I knew that nominations were coming out and everybody was hopeful. I think I was the only one who was of the mindset that if I get it, that's cool. If not, I'll continue with my career. But then the minute I got nominated I realized that my life was going to change. Interviews started pouring in and I got new opportunities for different shows; people calling all of a sudden who want to work with me. It really has been like an open door for me ever since I got nominated.  

This was my first album and I'm signed to an indie label and I don't have the kind of backing other artists do. There are other artists who are signed to major labels that back them up and pretty much make life much easier for them because they do all the work for them ... I'm very lucky to have gotten to this point without these resources.
