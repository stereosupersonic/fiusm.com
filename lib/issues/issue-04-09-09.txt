Headline: Hurricane Frances splashes out season opener
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Palms were sweaty, knees were shaking and players were ready but Hurricane Frances had other thoughts in mind.

Freshman and veterans alike were ready to open to 2004 season against the Jacksonville Dolphins on Sept. 2 but the Golden Panthers faced an opponent no team can stop-a hurricane.

The players were staying at the Miccousukkee Hotel, (their usual stay before any home game), when they found out the game was going to be canceled. 

The cancellation was a disappointment for both players and coaches.	

"Everyone was disappointed, the coaches were disappointed. We put a lot of hard work over the summer so we could play this game but things happen for a reason," said offensive lineman Ronny Silva.

The exhaustion was felt by Jamarcus Green who commented on the depressing aspect of the cancellation.   

"That took a lot out of me," said offensive lineman Green. "It was depressing that we couldn't play."

For many players, this was their first time through a hurricane and did not take Frances as a serious threat to Miami.

"When I first heard of Frances I didn't take it seriously. It didn't hit me till football players started leaving to take care of their families," said Green who stayed in the Towers.

Many players decided to stay on the university campus but took the time to visit family and go home.

"The team has a lot of Miami players, so pretty much everyone went home," said Silva. "The people who live up north in Tallahassee and all those places, went home for a little while."

	For many fans, the canceled game left the desire for live-action football.

"I was hoping the game would not be canceled because my friends and I were all planning to go and support the football team," said sophomore Christine Guzman. "We had all gotten the days off from work in order to go."

A big crowd was expected because the game was the first the FIU Golden Panthers would have played under the transition to Division I-A football, where a 15,000 home average requirement is needed.

"I am a big football fan and I was going to attend the game to support the team. I had not gone to games in the past but with Division I hopes, I was looking forward to it," said sophomore Mikel Urbistondo.

The game has yet to be rescheduled according to football SID Rich Kelch who is doubtful the Golden Panthers will face the Dolphins this season.  The next game is scheduled for Saturday against Youngstown at Ohio and the next home will take place on Sept. 25 against Western Kentucky.

 Method Man and Redman will perform after the game as FIU honors fans with Fan Appreciation Day.  

Fans wishing to attend must arrive to the game prior to the fourth quarter. Fans arriving later will not be allowed to come in.

&nbsp;
It was just yesterday when the Golden Panthers played their first football in front of a sold out crowd at "The Cage." Fast forward three years and now the team will open its third season with games at higher stakes - Division I-A football.	

It is hard to believe that FIU is the fastest university to apply to I-A. Lots of people question the move by Athletic Director Rick Mello to pursue I-A so quickly but in the long run, FIU needed to do this.

With Florida Atlantic University moving to I-A this year and with the University of Miami in town, FIU had to make this move to avoid falling behind. The biggest question will be whether the team can average 15,000 fans per game.

The university is making all the right moves by giving tons of giveaways including Don Strock bobble heads and FIU seat cushions. 

But, the biggest move FIU is doing is providing a free concert for fans during the Western Kentucky game. None other than famous rappers Method Man and Redman will be the highlights at the concert. 

The Golden Panthers will also play a home game at a bigger venue, the Orange Bowl. The team will face FAMU in the Orange Bowl Classic, which should draw over 20,000 fans.

FIU has some very talented players and if fans want football to stay here they will need to come out to the stands. 

Last year FIU had a losing record but four of the losses could have been a victory if a play or two had gone right. 

The offense has a talented duo of receivers in Harold Leath and Cory McKinney. The defense has a linebacker in Antwon Barnes who could be the first Golden Panther drafted into the NFL.

This is an exciting team with players that are hungry for success. Everyone knows Miami is a win driven town and the only way FIU will attract large crowds will be if the team can start winning more games. 

The team won four games the inaugural season and two games the following season, but this doesn't mean the team regressed. The Panthers faced  talented teams and this year will be no different. They will face I-A schools, which are no joke.

Strock knows wins are what eventually will draw fans to the stadium, not bobble heads or FIU visors. He knows the team is no longer young and being young is no longer an excuse for losing. 

FIU will open the season Saturday in hopes of drawing fans and proving to the community they belong in Division I-A. The players are hungry, the giveaways are set to be handed out, and Method Man and Redman are on their way; the question is, will you show up?

Headline: Student-athletes share how to work fitness into college life
Author: Bridgette Williams / The Dallas Morning News
&nbsp;
Staying fit, or deciding to get fit, can be a challenge in college, with its crazy study schedules, classes and jobs, friends to meet and pizzas to eat. 

But college also means campus activities that can get you up, out, around and involved. Take your pick from any number of phys-ed classes, intramurals and sports clubs. 

There's no denying that balancing it all is the key. We asked area students who are especially determined to stay fit how they do it and how the rest of us might get started. 

Amber McMeans, a three-time, All-American gymnast from Hurst, Texas, and a junior at Texas Woman's University, has been a gymnast for 17 years. Her specialty is the balance beam, but she also competes in the vault, floor and uneven bar events. 

THE WORKOUT

 During the gymnastics season, from January to April, the team works out four hours a day, five days a week. There's running at 5:30 a.m. before class and more practice after class. Off-season, Amber practices and works out on her own time. 

THE STUDIES

 Amber, 20, is a psychology major at TWU, aiming to be a school counselor or psychology teacher. In keeping with NCAA regulations, she takes at least 12 hours of classes a semester and usually studies after practices, with lots of late nights. 

"It can be stressful, and sometimes it's exhausting, but it's not anything that's not doable. Exercising helps relieve stress. Sometimes it can just take your mind off everything that's going on in the world." 

THE MOTIVATION

Amber's motivation to stay in shape comes from her team. "Nothing about gymnastics is individual. It's all about us working together, and we each have to do our best." 

That bond translates to other aspects of college life. 

"As a team, we try to look out for each other and help each other keep a healthy mentality. It's good to have someone around going through the same things you're going through because they understand exactly what you're saying." 

THE ADVICE

"Whatever you're able to do that's convenient for your schedule, I'd say go for it, whether it's working out, sports or joining intramural teams. It all starts with your mentality. 

"If you know you want to develop a healthier lifestyle, take baby steps. 

"Start with an organized mindset on how you want to do things. On top of your classes, schedule a workout program for yourself. 

"Whatever your thing might be, you need to be happy with what you're doing for it to work, whether it be school or eating habits."

Mike Austin, 21, is a Southern Methodist University senior from Seattle who plays intramural sports _ specifically football, basketball and volleyball. 

THE WORKOUT

Mike makes time to hit the gym. Monday is chest and triceps day, and Tuesday is back and biceps. Shoulders and abs on Wednesday, legs on Thursday. Friday is free day. A little cardio every day, and intramural games take up an hour, a few times a week. 

THE STUDIES

 Mike is a financial consulting major who studies after class when he can and at night. Exercising helps him cut the stress. 

"It's hard to balance such a hard curriculum and a strict workout schedule because when you have papers, a test or my friends want to hang out, it can be hard to get to the gym. That's why I try to stick to a schedule. When I get tired, I take a week or so off, and that's a good thing to do, too, to let your body rest." 

THE MOTIVATION

 When Mike was a freshman, he started intramurals to get involved in something. 

"It was also a good way to stay in shape because between working, school work and the college lifestyle, it's easy to get in bad shape. 

"Most frats have teams that play in tournaments, and with all the sports available, there are lots of chances to play just about any sport you can think of." 

THE ADVICE

 "If you're new on campus and if you're starting to get healthy, get involved. Get involved in your dorms. Most of them have intramural teams themselves or residents who play on a team. 

"Start there, and you'll find ways to stay active." 

Make a schedule that you can stick to, and try to work out with a friend. 

"It could be a roommate or just someone else in the dorm. That extra person can get you motivated to go work out when you don't feel like it."

WHAT YOU CAN DO 

Intramurals: Intramural sports are usually offered year-around. 

Here's just a sample of the men's, women's and co-ed teams you might find: flag football, softball, football, racquetball, table tennis, basketball, indoor and outdoor soccer, volleyball, sand volleyball, golf. 

How good do you have to be? As good as you want to be. But some do get competitive. 

Sports clubs: Archery, crew, folk dancing, field hockey, cycling, swimming, ice hockey, polo and gymnastics are just a few clubs offered at Texas universities. 

Clubs often welcome a range of skill levels, and offer instruction. They often compete against other universities' clubs and regional teams, and some charge dues. 

Check your university's Web site for more information. 

Go solo: Enrolled students who have paid their fees can take advantage of the rec center at most schools. Here's your chance to experiment: 

Try the swimming pool, weight room, track, gym equipment, aerobics classes and yoga. 

Or get in shape and get credit for it. You've got elective hours, right? Use `em. Why breeze through badminton when you could challenge yourself with weight training? 

	If nothing else: walk, walk, walk. Allow enough time between classes for a stroll. And always take the stairs.

Headline: Volleyball Coach Cookie Stevens optimistic on season despite a high number of new players
Author: Natalie Sabia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Q:   How have you and the team been preparing for this upcoming season? 

We have been practicing at least two times each day for the last 2 weeks and we have been doing team building exercises, physical conditioning, individual skill work, team concepts and strategies. 

Q:  What are your expectations for this season?

I am very encouraged that even though this is a new team of players, we have good talent and some players with experience already to help us be competitive from the start. Our goal is to work hard and put the puzzle pieces together each week, that will bring us success. 

Q:  Are you excited about the new players?

Very excited, these players are hard working, dedicated and passionate about playing and winning.

Q:  How do you mold your young players?

Demand from them everyday a level of excellence on and off the court and be consistent and caring. They have to know the coaches care about them as people first. 

Q:    How do you feel about the schedule of games your team will be playing this season?

I think the schedule is very challenging but very doable as far as wins against conference opponents and exciting to play the new non-conference opponents. 

Q:    How do you get the team in shape for the season?

The players worked hard to come in to training camp in good physical shape, before they got here. Of course, some more than others. But training two times a day, every day for two weeks - gets you in shape quickly.

 It will take a few matches to find the right combinations. This process is ongoing throughout the season. Many things can affect the puzzle: injuries, players going in and out of mental slumps and confidence levels. 

But our job as coaches is to train the team everyday and try to bring the best out of each player helping them to gain a higher level of performance every couple of weeks. 

Q:     What do you think is the best way to maintain a strategy for winning?

Know our strengths and weaknesses as a team. Capitalize on our strengths and reduce our weak areas. Know what our opponent is capable of, plan for it, and set realistic goals.

Headline: Under new coach 'Tiger' Clark, defense switches to 4-3 formation
Author: Henry Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Twenty-eight points per game, a four-and-a-half yard rushing average and a miniscule twenty-one sacks. When you couple those underacheving numbers with the fact that opposing teams averaged more yards rushing (227) than they did passing (172), defensive line changes are a must.

Last year's team opened the season playing a 3-4 alignment. As a result, the defense suffered and was forced to revert to the original 4-3 scheme halfway into the schedule. 

"We had to change it up," declared Defensive Line Coach Taubert. "We're more familiar with the 4-3 because that's how we first started".

 Last season's 3-4 style demanded  large defensive tackles that can handle at least two offensive linemen. That means putting up with, and pushing off nearly 600 pounds every play while simultaneously trying to make a tackle. 

While arduous, this task is not impossible and is successfully executed by many teams. However, the defenses that accomplish this enlist gargantuan men on their rosters who routinely exceed 300 pounds. 

The Golden Panthers do not have that luxury. The defensive tackle average on the team was 257 pounds. The large discrepancy in weight represents trouble.  It means opposing linemen are usually heavier, leading to offensive success for the enemy. 

Opposing teams found big holes to run through and had lots of time to release the football. Because of this, it should come as no surprise that teams averaged more than ten minutes of possession time against the Golden Panthers. 

Giving up an extra ten minutes of offense tires the defense and limits the offense. Opposing teams outscored FIU all season and why the Panthers produced a disappointing 2-10 record. 

This year, FIU acquired a full-time defensive coordinator to avoid last year's debacle. Bernard Claker is taking over the squad in hopes of improving a defense that gave up 28.4 points per game. 

"I'm bringing a lot of different things with me," said Clark. 

For one, he is focusing on the 4-3 defensive scheme and plans to bolster it with the addition of a 4-6 defense. The 4-6 simply brings a safety up to act as an extra linebacker. 

This move will undoubtedly help the run defense by providing one extra tackler near the line of scrimmage. The 3-4 will not be totally abolished, but will only be used sparingly in situational downs. 

"I feel the 4-3 is better. It covers all the gaps and produces more pressure on the quarterback," said Clark.

The players also seem to agree that the new defense will allow them to be more proactive. 

"We'll be able to attack more with the 4-3 because offensive linemen will have more defenders to block," said linebacker Gerrod Bodie,.

 With more defensive players on the line of scrimmage, linebackers will have more room to run and make plays. The old 3-4 formation let offensive linemen go out and chase linebackers. 

It also let them dominate defensive linemen by double-teaming them. These problems will be minimized by the new set up.

 "I'm excited because I won't have to deal with linemen coming at me this year," said linebacker Lance Preston.

Headline: FIU not ready for Division I-A football
Subheadline: Commentary
Author: Messod Bendayan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Well, here we are, folks. Part trois of FIU Football. Year uno of I-A.

It seems like yesterday when 17, 314 fans packed into FIU Community Stadium to see the Inaugural Game, way back on Aug. 29, 2002. I was a sophomore, then, and that game was my first taste of being a football play-by-play broadcaster. 

Now, I'm about to graduate. I get to call five more games before Radio Golden Panther sends me packing. And my school's about to get its first taste of big-time college football. 

Goodbye, St. Peter's College, Elon, Butler, Gardner-Webb, Albany and all of the other small-time Division I-AA schools FIU played during these last two years. It's been a pleasure knowing you. Good luck in the future. 

Hello, Kansas State, Texas Tech, Alabama and all of the other Division I-A schools FIU has yet to schedule. Oh, and all of you Sun Belt schools, too, even if you're the worst conference in I-A football. FIU wouldn't be here without you. 

I'm pretty excited about my Golden Panthers moving up to the level of Miami, Florida and Florida State. And there's certainly a nice ring to this statement: "FIU's transition from I-AA to I-A is the fastest ever." 

Oh, you haven't heard that yet? Guess you've been at the beach all summer. Get used to it. You're going to be hearing it- a lot. Especially when the losses come. 

I'm a Golden Panthers fan, to be sure. But, I'm also an aspiring media geek, and in the business I hope to go into, facts are facts. And the facts about this move are depressingly simple: FIU isn't ready for big-time college football. 

Here's 5 reasons why:

1. The Golden Panthers' all-time record: 7 wins, 16 losses. Most of their opponents up to this point have been I-AA schools. The difference between I-AA and I-A is huge. It's like comparing the Florida Marlins to the Durham Bulls, or comparing the Miami Dolphins to Miami's former arena football league franchise, the Hooters - both of whom can claim FIU Head Coach Don Strock as a former member.  

2. FIU has never won a road game. 

3. FIU has never beaten a scholarship opponent. All of their wins have come against non-scholarship I-AA schools, which means that the majority of those school's athletes don't get a scholarship to play football. Like most of FIU's students, those student-athletes usually pay for school out of their own pocket. 

All Division I-A programs grant at least 85 scholarships, and FIU has yet to beat one of those teams. 

4. FIU has averaged roughly 7,000 fans a game, which is 8,000 short of what they need if they're to stay I-A past 2005, according to the NCAA.

5. FIU Community Stadium needs a makeover like Pam Anderson needed breast implants. That is, unless FIU's looking to be on the Top 5 list of 'smallest and ugliest I-A Football stadiums'. 

But at least it's not called something totally nasty and disgusting, like Pharmed Arena (formerly known as Golden Panther Arena), yet.

To say that this move is premature is an injustice to the word "premature." This is like a baby being born only five months in the womb and expecting it to live. 

Sure, it can happen, but it's going to take a lot of hard work and skillful people. All the rabbit's feet and four-leaf clovers in South Florida would probably help, too.

FIU Athletic Director Rick Mello has told me - and everyone else he talks to - that FIU had to make this move now, despite all the facts I listed above. And he may be right; events in Coral Gables and Boca Raton certainly forced his hand.

Miami's move to the Atlantic Coast Conference saw a domino effect on every other conference, especially small ones like the Sun Belt. 

They lost New Mexico State and Utah State to the Western Athletic Conference after the lost some of their schools to other conferences. 

That put the Sun Belt with less football teams, jeopardizing their I-A status with the NCAA. FIU's already a Sun Belt member in all of their other sports, and they need to use Sun Belt schools to get 5 I-A schools to play at FIU next year, an NCAA requirement for moving to I-A. If FIU doesn't go I-A now, the Sun Belt and FIU is up a certain kind of creek with no paddles.

Florida Atlantic's move to I-A put the Golden Panthers in an unenviable position. FAU, overall, is better-prepared to make the move than FIU is, and in a market that may well be over-saturated with college football teams, FAU or FIU cannot afford to let the other get too far ahead of them, lest the one left behind be deemed irrelevant. 

FAU's move to the Sun Belt also put pressure on FIU; don't think the other conference members weren't putting the screws on FIU to make the jump when their neighbor to the north and fellow conference rival had already done so.

To protect FIU's massive investment in the big money-maker of all collegiate sports, Mello was forced to put his John Hancock on this move, even though he, and pretty much everyone else in FIU, knows that this program isn't ready for I-A. 

To delay was probably to be left behind Owl poop and Hurricane debris for good. 

To delay would almost certainly mean that FIU better start looking for another conference to call home. Too much had been invested into football to see that happen now. It was time to perform the football equivalent of a Caesarean birth.

So, here we go with part trois of FIU Football. A premature baby is about to be born into a very unforgiving world. 

For its sake, I hope this baby's strong enough to begin walking on its own, quick. History is not on its side.

Headline: Student radio broadcasts football

&nbsp;
Tucked away in FIU's press box during the Golden Panther Football games are not only the voices who shout out every detail that fans are already saying in their heads, but they are also the voices that blissfully bring us up to speed of the most crucial things that are happening down on the field.  

Among the announcers and analysts whom we listen to are Sports Director Andres Cordero, Messod Bendayan, Will Schanez and Harry Coleman.  These men are the faces behind the microphones during the most thrilling sports events at FIU, who bring their fans the most desired sports information by the second.

"I really enjoy calling the games," said Bendayan, "I am a huge sports nut."

Despite the small space they have to work with in the press box, both the play-by-play announcers and game analysts sit anxiously in their seats to broadcast games.

By dividing the staff in two different crews, they are able to broadcast each football game, including those games away.  

"Football is the only sport that we travel for, because it's the sport FIU is trying to push the most," said Cordero. Along with the twelve football games coming up this fall, WRGP Radio is also involved with basketball, soccer, baseball and volleyball games. 

Broadcasting on 88.1 FM, the WRGP, which is Radio Golden Panther, the sports staff is already getting set in gear for an exciting upcoming football season.  

On top of their game list are the games that will be played in the Orange Bowl, against FAMU, and in Pro Player Stadium, verses FAU.  

"I am looking forward to those games because we will be in a real press box," said Cordero.

Securing a storyline that will go along with each game is their most difficult job.

Whether it may be a particular threat that the opposing team will pose or maybe an interesting story that involves a player, both the announcer and analyst must create their storytelling voices fast enough so they don't get behind the action, but yet still entertain their crowd.  

"Trying to work in a story is the most difficult," said Bendayan.

Among the sports announcers, who are all very much sports nuts, they all go through a lot of preparation before announcing a game.  

"It's not an easy thing to just become an announcer," said Bendayan.  

"It is a tremendous help to alternate games," said Bendayan.

Considering that WRGP is strictly a "volunteer" radio station, securing employees who will commit, while developing an on-air chemistry with the staff is the station's main focus.  

For most of the announcer's, including senior journalism major Messod, it is really the experience that plays into hand.  

"At the end, it is all worth it," said Bendayan.

Along with the other broadcast majors, also for senior Andres, announcing games is an opportunity of a lifetime.  

"I have been a sports fan my whole life and I wanted to get some broadcasting under my belt," said Cordero.

Despite which crew announces the games, you can be sure that the people behind it all work through long hours of dedication to keep the sports spirit alive in each of their listening fans.

The next broadcast will be on Sept. 25, for football's home game against Western Kentucky.

Headline: Smith returns strong from tendon injury
Author: Natalie Sabia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
He rushes down the field protecting the football that he holds tightly to his body while passing defenders as they latch out towards him. He looks up ahead in hopes to see the end zone near; this year, look for him to be there, look out for running back Rashod Smith.  

This season, it will be his No. 4 jersey sprinting down the field, celebrating his rushing yards, along with touchdowns.  Standing at 5-feet-8-inches and carrying 188 pounds of muscle, Smith is ready for his comeback; the question is, are opponents ready for him?

Recovering from an injury last year, after slicing a tendon in his foot from a run in with a piece of glass, the senior running back is anxiously awaiting his return to the field after an injury that was more serious than initially thought.  

"I stepped on glass in the cafeteria, but I didn't know it was that serious," said Smith.  

Smith was limited to only six games last season and finished with 278 rushing yards, third best on the team.  

While his teammates played throughout the season, Smith continued to get healthy in hopes for another try. 

 "I tried to get back and play, but I couldn't run," said Smith who had gained over 1,000 yards on 194 carries, before his injury while averaging 5.5 yards per run.

During his freshman year at Bryant College in Rhode Island, Smith was already a talented player, who rapidly became a glimmer in people's eyes. 

He averaged more than 60 yards in his first two games of the year, but after breaking a toe he was unable to return.  Despite a frustrating season, Smith headed home to Miami for a fresh start. 

 "I wanted to get back home to keep playing, especially for a new program like FIU had to offer," said Smith.

The Sports Management major, who is no stranger to the Dean's List, came to FIU as s sophomore and was non-other than team MVP after leading the Golden Panthers with 784 yards over nine games and averaging 6 yards per carry.  

As FIU's leading scorer in 2002, with nine touchdowns, sitting out in 2003 was a major upset for Smith. 

 "I had to learn how to walk again, but I'm ready to get back into the swing of things," said Smith.

As far as Smith is concerned, the Golden Panthers are ready for action.  Their days have been consumed by daily practices on the field, while getting focused for the season.

  "Right now were taking one step at a time and one play at a time," said Smith. "Were getting ready for Thursday [season opener]."  

Despite Smith's nagging injuries he has endured and the fact that he hasn't played a full season in a while, he is prepared to get back on the field and do what he is great at.  

"I'm good now," said Smith, "I'm excited to get back with my team. I just want to help my team through the whole season."

Headline: Position by Position Analysis:
Subheadline: FIU strong at QB, Receivers, weak on offensive line
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the 2-10 record neatly tucked in the back of their minds, the Golden Panthers are set to kick-off a new football season. The sports world is cyclical and once the disappointment of a losing season fades, it's replaced with the hope and prospect of a clean slate. 

Regardless of last season's performance, every team kicks off the Fall with a zero in the loss column. FIU will try to add wins by relying on its strength, the offense. While it's a widely accepted cliché that defense wins games, it's still impossible to win without putting points on the board. What follows is a preview of the individual parts that make up the offensive unit for 2004.

Offensive Line

The O-line is the backbone of any offense. Unfortunately for the Golden Panthers, this is where the team is in most disarray. FIU has two very capable quarterbacks on its roster and it may need them both if the O-line can't protect the starter. 

The unit has given up 76 sacks for 583 yards over the past two seasons. With junior John Shanahan suffering a high-ankle sprain in a recent scrimmage, FIU will start the season with three offensive linemen sidelined. Tackle Tim Dierks (knee) and Guard Jonathan Taylor (shoulder), who combined for 1,579 snaps in 2003, will be alongside Shanahan on the injured list.      

Offensive line coach Leon Searcy will look for converted defensive tackle Ronny Silva and freshman Tad McConahie to contribute. McConahie is a 6-feet-3, 310-pound lineman who can play guard, tackle and center. His strength and versatility has earned him praise from the coaching staff and made him a viable option to fill some of the holes left by injury. The bottom line is games are won and lost along the line of scrimmage and the offense will need the O-line to hold up to be effective.

Running Backs 

The Golden Panthers' ground attack rushed for 1,417 yards and 16 touchdowns in 2003. When placed side-by-side with last year's Sun Belt Conference teams, the ground game ranks 6th in touchdowns, rushing yards and yards per game. 

The team's leading rusher in 2003 was  full back Adam Gorman (736 yards, 8 TD), who stepped in because of injuries and was named the offensive player of the year. He and Diamos Demerritt became the first FIU tandem to rush for 100 yards each in the same game last year. Demerritt will not be back because of the six felony counts he's being charged with as a result of his alleged involvement in an on-campus robbery attempt.  

The player expected to fill the team's starting role as halfback is returning senior Rashod Smith, who battled injuries throughout the 2003 season. Smith is the school's only career 1,000 yard rusher. In his sophomore season, Smith was voted team MVP by his teammates after rushing for 784 yards in just nine games. 

The player to keep an eye on is true freshman Julian Reams out of Coral Reef High School. A true freshman is a player directly out of high school. He's making strides in practice and coaches like his quickness as well as his ability to make cuts and hit holes.    

Tight Ends

Junior Joe Struyf will be sidelined with a possible season-ending surgery. This means that the door is open for either Samuel Smith or Moses Hinton to step into the starting role. Smith is a sophomore who caught 9 passes for 119 yards in 11 games as a true freshman. Coaches are impressed with his progress and he holds a slight advantage over the freshman Hinton. 

Hinton is a big and physical player who at 6-foot-5, 260 pounds can be a force at the line of scrimmage. The tight end position is the biggest toss-up on the team and the former Delray Beach standout has a legitimate shot to start

Receivers

The receiver position is one of the strongest on the FIU offense. With returning starters such as Harold Leath (6-foot-3,199 lbs.) and Cory McKinney (6-foot-3,219 lbs.) both healthy, the team's passing game should be every bit as good as it has been. They are the school's only career 1,000 yard receivers. Both played in all 12 games last season, and were a huge part of Josh Padrick's break-out season. 

Also in the mix will be senior Chandler Williams and junior Andre Rollins. Williams is an experienced threat that made 29 catches for 460 yards last year as the  number three receiver playing the slot. 

Rollins has been impressive in the spring after returning from a shoulder injury. At 6-foot-4 and 222 pounds, the big guy out of Carol City High can be a good option at the slot or wide-out position. He looks more comfortable in the offense than in previous years and should see more time in the wide receiver rotation.

Quarterbacks     

If ever there was a strong position on this team, this is it. The Golden Panthers have a good situation at quarterback with the return of Josh Padrick and a healthy Jamie Burke. Padrick stepped in for the injured Burke in 2003 and quickly became the story of the year en route to a school record 2,493 yards. 

The number of sacks decreased with Padrick under center due in part to his superior mobility over Burke. After averaging 226.3 yards per game and completing nearly 50 percent of his passes, the starting job is his to lose. 

Burke is returning from his third career ACL surgery and has spent much of the off-season getting stronger. He was impressive in his freshman year and is expected to challenge for the starting spot. David Tabor is an experienced back up who can step in if things go terribly wrong for the number one and two guys.

The addition of Tavares Kendrick is a solid move for the future of this team. Kendrick was the top rated quarterback out of the top-25 Miami-Dade recruits and should be the quarterback of the future for FIU. At 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, he runs a 4.60 second 40-yard dash. He is praised for his size, speed, and powerful arm.

Headline: Fearsome Frances: beware of my destructive breeze
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Pandemonium. Mass chaos in the streets, gas shortages everywhere, people fighting over the last case of Aquafina. Journalists described you as the one that could rival Andrew. 

They told us to get shutters, plywood, or anything to protect our shelter and our family. I expected to lose water and power. I expected to lose half of my shingles and a couple of windows panes. 

I expected to heat SpaghettiOs with a sterno and eat them by candlelight in a stifling, pitch-black pit of your creation. In a sick way, I was looking forward to it.     

Quite frankly Frances, I expected more from you. You call yourself a hurricane? 

You resembled a group of swarming gnats rather than the four horsemen I thought you'd be. 

Yes, you did get me out of a couple days of school and work and I thank you for that, but couldn't it have been at least a month into the semester, you know, when I really needed it? 

There are words for hurricanes like you Frances, and among those the best I could think of is "punk." You saunter into the Atlantic like some sort of threat, taking your sweet time to get here. Then, by the time you limp past the Bahamas, you're a category 2 at best. 

I don't think you know who you're dealing with, Frances. We survived Andrew: a category 5, town shattering force that spit out houses like pieces of chewed gum that had lost its flavor. 

After he passed, people used words like "survived" and made T-shirts in his honor. 

Do you think people are going to make t-shirts after you? I wouldn't hold my 60 mph breath if I were you.

You might argue your importance by remarking on the four major networks 257-hour coverage of you. But let's break this down a bit. 

Your only competition was the last part of the Republican National Convention. And if it's between your swirling patterns and President Bush trying to pronounce "no child left behind" in Spanish, I think we both know what we'd rather watch.  

But I'll give it to you Frances, you are a clever rogue. You are the storm that cried hurricane. And we all flocked into the stores knowing you might be "the big one." 

And you did do some damage, humbled us a bit, and made lots of people annoyed and miss their 21st century comforts. But we're still standing, Frances.

As you unravel in the south, I hope you think about that. You get an E for Effort though. 

  Oh, and if Ivan asks, tell him the Carolina beaches are wonderful this time of year.

Headline: Facts get fuzzier as election day approaches
Author: Laura Scott / Kansas City Star
&nbsp;
In last year's movie "Something's Gotta Give," Jack Nicholson tries to explain his errant behavior as a suitor to Diane Keaton:

"I've never lied to you. I've always told you some version of the truth," he offers, weakly.

But, she protests: "Truth doesn't have versions."

Ah, Diane, wish you were right. But sorry, in love, as many people know, the truth often does have versions. And people choose to believe what they want to believe about what a lover is saying or doing. It's a human foible connected to being in love.

Unfortunately, politics is a lot like love in this regard, and people act much the same. Best example to date: The different versions of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry's Vietnam War record.

Another fresh example: two versions about the ability of this country to win the war on terrorism -- both from the mouth of President Bush, one day apart.

It's an election year, and Americans know what that means. Voters have been subjected through advertising and campaign rhetoric to the usual nonissues, side issues, misstatements and outright distortions. Most are some version of the truth, loosely defined.

Whom can voters trust? Who speaks the true truth? And how can voters ever possibly know?

Absent guarantees, it seems most Americans are choosing what to believe based on their personal views of the candidates themselves. Public opinion polls show us to be an already polarized country concerning our choices in the presidential election, and the Republicans haven't even finished their nominating convention yet.

Some say that Kerry asked for a dissection of his war record by making his veteran status part of his resume to serve as president.

Yet, the dissection that occurred -- by a GOP-connected veterans group -- has been countered by a claim of inaccuracy that is backed up by official records.

The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a misnamed group if ever there was one, bought airtime to present their version of the Democratic nominee's record.

They basically claimed Kerry was a liar and a coward and did not deserve the medals and honors he received for valor in combat.

The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth discredited the stories of other veterans who actually served with Kerry in the war, including one who says Kerry saved his life by plucking him out of the water under enemy fire.

In fact, one of Kerry's chief detractors on the war issue received a Bronze Star for the very same action that he now says Kerry fabricated. The military's official version of what happened is incorrect, he says. I'm sure his memory hasn't faded in all these years.

Further, many Republicans now say, the issue of military service isn't important in choosing a president. That isn't what they said when Bill Clinton ran for president, of course. 

Clinton, a Democrat, was denounced for eight years for choosing to evade military service during the Vietnam years.

So now the Democrats have a candidate who fits the requirements of volunteering, showing up and putting his life on the line. And Republicans -- all of a sudden -- put down that service as unimportant. Which version of that doublespeak do Americans choose to believe?

Speaking of Bush, this week he confused Americans with his comments on winning the terrorism war. First, he says we can't and then he says we can.

One of these statements probably was a misstatement, and I am guessing the first one.

But it might have been the most honest one, if you look at the war on terrorism in the big picture. We likely will be fighting against terrorism for many decades to come.

But I figure those who support the president do not want him going around saying that the war on terrorism can't be won. So Bush's handlers got to him, plotted a new statement, and on Tuesday, the president reversed course.

The election is not until November, and it is just September. Lots more time for "facts" and "records" to show up.

But because most Americans seem to have made up their minds about whom to believe and what to believe, it is likely that we will just continue batting "facts" back and forth. Likely most voters won't be dislodged from their favorite fellow.

That leaves the minority of undecideds in key states to determine which way this election will go. And the campaign spinmeisters are going to be very busy trying to appeal to them in the coming weeks.

Hold your ears, cover your eyes, and wait for incoming. More versions of the truth are on the way.

In moments of crisis, one of the first things we are forced to sacrifice are our basic rights, guaranteed by the amendments. Only in the most exceptional of situations is such action understandable but in the sheer chaos last weekend, when FIU closed because of Hurricane Frances' impending arrival, our rights as journalists were unabashedly overlooked.

It's difficult to think that at FIU the first amendment is taken for granted (to refresh your memory, the first amendment guarantees freedom of the press). Last weekend, the red tape of bureaucracy was woven so thick that this freedom seemed like a dream.

While trying to report on the hurricane and tell the story of thousands of students living on campus, The Beacon encountered more hesitation than Frances had as she slowly made her way towards Florida. Trying to interview anybody important was nearly impossible. 

During the storm, speaking to the administration seemed out of the question and resident assistants were given orders to remain tight-lipped by the resident life coordinator. Although we were able to speak with administration after the storm, it was too little too late.

We understand this is not a direct violation of our first amendment rights and we are grateful to be able to publish this opinion. Furthermore, we were ultimately able to work around and solve the problem through other resources. What really concerns us is the lack of cooperation for such an important matter. 

Had the situation been different and the big story involved, for example, providing coverage for some sort of housing event or special program, the doors of information would have welcomed The Beacon warmly. 

If we are expected to serve our purpose as journalists and produce a quality newspaper that is honest and recognizable for its exceptional work, we cannot be taken so lightly. We expect to receive the same treatment as any other major newspaper. The Beacon is by no means a public relations rag; we strive to be an important source of information, created by students who care about this university.

We are deeply saddened and disappointed by the lack of cooperation during Frances. Hopefully, we can strike new ground and create a new cooperative relationship. Such helpful actions can only benefit FIU.

Headline: Students find ways to escape hurricane doldrums
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
Expecting rough winds and massive rains, students around FIU sought shelter last week either on or off campus, hoping to avoid what seemed like the imminent arrival of then category 4 hurricane Frances.

On campus, resident students remained in their dorms, the thick windows and walls keeping the noises of the eventual storm out; off campus, many left the smoke of their "hurricane party" grills behind, finding themselves inside shuttered houses, a few family and friends their only companions.

Whatever shelter route taken, many students would agree that in an attempt to escape from the arms of the storm, there was one calamity that could not to be escaped: boredom.

Mike Calero, a sophomore who decided to stay in Panther Hall during the few days of Frances, believed that, despite efforts from the students to keep themselves entertained, the feeling described as "cabin fever" could not be quickly ignored.

"We played ping-pong, pool, volleyball, a whole bunch of board games, soccer in the hallways for a really short time because it's not allowed by the [resident assistants], and basically did a lot of sleeping and eating. You do a lot of that when you have nothing else to do."

From  Sept. 3 to early Sept. 5, when Frances' landfall brought about heavier winds, some of the housing was placed under temporary lockdown, in which no one could either leave or enter the buildings without special permission. 

This decision brought about mixed reactions from the students.

"When they said we couldn't leave the building, it kind of sucked, because you knew you were about to get cabin fever, you knew you just didn't want to be here. I mean, you know they're doing it for your own safety, but nobody likes to be caged in, even if it is your own house," said Calero.

Ramon Alatorre, a freshman also living in Panther Hall, took a different stance on the policy. 

"Honestly, I didn't care much about the lockdown. I wasn't getting out anyways, only going to the cafeteria and back. I really wasn't planning on hanging out in the weather, so when they put us under house-arrest, it seemed normal to me."

If anything, students agree that it was the solidarity they found among neighbors while grounded in their dorms that afforded them the most entertainment.

"From what I saw, the few people left in the dorms were getting along," said Alatorre.  "We talked about how bored we were and did things to keep occupied, but I think the mood was pretty much high-spirited."

On the other side of the school, the 10 out of 30 residing members of FIJI house who decided to remain throughout the hurricane found their own means of entertainment.

"During the weekend, the weather wasn't that bad. We walked around sometimes looking for some place that was opened so we could eat, and the only thing we found was the Latin American Cafeteria on 107th street," said Aaron Anderson, junior, who has been living in the FIJI fraternity house for three years.

Besides searching for adventure and food, the fraternity members volunteered their services to their nearest neighbor, Modesto A. Maidique, stopping by the FIU president's on-campus house to see if he needed any assistance. Besides taking him his morning paper, though, there was not much to be done.

Later, out of what the members claim was the tediousness of that long monotony, the residents decided to move towards more desperate actions.

"It just got so boring, we all decided to clean the house together,"  said Anderson. 

For those students who left campus, choosing to stay in more homely shelters with family and friends during the windy weekend, the doldrums of a shuttered house proved to be as inescapable as any boredom faced by the housing residents.

"I went back home to Davie to put up shutters for my family and neighbors and then I just stayed there," said David Carr, a junior currently living in the FIJI house as a non-member resident. 

"But when I was there, there wasn't much to do-sleep, eat, watch the Dolphins' game, see movies, but mostly sleep. Yeah, there was just a lot of sleep. Actually, there was just way too much sleep."

Sleep, games, and just the presence of another soul - for some, with the hurricane like a lullaby pulsing against shutters or storm-proofed windows, it was these things that eventualy became the most sought after and appreciated survival kit during the wait through that slow-moving storm.

Headline: HURRICANE HALTS FIU
Author: Harry Coleman / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
Hurricane Frances, the second major storm to affect South Florida in less than a month, brought the FIU community to a halt on Sept. 2 as predictions of menacing floods and heavy gusts of wind permeated the air.

While the supposed Category 4 storm slowly approached, offices and buildings at the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses closed early in preparation for the event. 

"We put bags on the computers and took everything off the floor. We always expect flooding in [Primera Casa]," Shawnda Mair, program assistant at the Registration office, said. 

As preparations continued, students at UP found themselves in long lines as they attempted to make those last minute payments and registration changes.

"The window has been very busy,"  Mair said. "Students came to do everything before the hurricane."

Lines also stretched around the Academic One building at the BBC campus as students waited in anticipation for the hurricane and attempted to beat the Sept. 4 payment deadline, which has now been extended until Sept. 11.

While crowded lines and early closing of offices sent many scurrying all over BBC, Bay Vista housing residents on the same campus faced the problem of evacuation. Some of the students drove to UP and others were bussed to Panther Hall from the northern campus at the onset of the hurricane on Sept. 2.

All 38 students and staff members took up residence in student lounges in Panther Hall and later throughout lounges in Everglades Hall.

"When they said we'd be leaving BBC, I had no idea we'd be evacuating so early," said senior and Bay Vista housing resident Jennifer Ngo. "If anything, I'll have a story to tell when I get back to my college," added the exchange student from Mesa State College in Colorado.

According to the executive director of Student Affairs, Auxiliaries and Operations James Wassenaar, students were evacuated from BBC due to a mandatory evacuation order issued by the county. 

The saga for BBC housing students continued as they arrived at UP and found themselves in a frenzy of students scattering around trying to find food and a more comfortable place to stay off-campus before having to take up possible shelter in PC. 

"I am [at the cafeteria] to get one last good meal before I have to go to the shelter. They said they would make us go soon," said sophomore and Towers resident Kristin Quigley. "We want to get a spot before the community comes over," she added referring to the 550 spots available if Monroe County residents evacuated and sought shelter at FIU, their appointed shelter during major storms or hurricanes.

Whereas UP housing students worried about food and a possible evacuation, BBC housing students were in the thick of their own storm. 

Throughout the three days they spent living in Panther Hall and Everglades Hall, BBC students slept on mattresses in student lounges, used the showers at the Golden Panther Arena, and ate what free food the cafeteria was able to prepare under the intense circumstances.  

"I enjoyed the free cafeteria meals," said Ngo, who later added that the circumstances were not ideal.

As BBC students worried about evacuating, UP housing students were urged to buy food and gather supplies in preparation for the hurricane.

"I went grocery shopping and bought water, bread and cheese," said sophomore and UP Towers resident Reena Ramnarine. "I'm from Trinidad so we barely ever see a hurricane, this is all new to me."

A few creative students had other priorities in mind as Frances approached land.

"[For preparations] I waxed my surfboard and I bought a bunch of beer. I figured everybody else would get water so I can barter for water. My beer is going to be worth more than water," said junior and Panther Hall resident Bill Buckanan.

Some just simply went without preparing. 

"I didn't buy specific food or anything...I just kept whatever I thought I'd be good with," said freshman Bryan Fox. "What we've been eating [at the cafeteria] wasn't the best but... they are doing the best they can do with what they got," added Fox referring to the free pizza and hamburgers given at the cafeteria.

This in stark contrast to the many students at the University Park Apartments and in the FIJI house who weathered the storm unaware of the food being provided to other housing students at the same campus. 

Further adding to the scuttle for food and comfort, housing students were also urged by resident assistants to close all windows and blinds, cover valuable items with plastic and store items off the floor to avoid water damage. 

"I packed up all my electronics and my shoes. I used plastic bags and tapes and put everything in high places. I put the mattress against the window like the RA said," said Ernestine Saint-Louis, a junior and resident in housing.

Despite the efforts of the housing staff, some of the given information sent mixed signals and left many students bewildered. Some students were told to evacuate immediately in Panther Hall while students in the University Park Apartments were given until late night to evacuate on Sept. 2. 

Resident assistants also informed students that it was better to leave than to be evacuated to PC.

"We spoke to students to see who was staying. We encouraged them to go home so it's not chaos if we have to evacuate.  Many students went with friends to their parents' homes or left to be with their families," said Towers' resident assistant Shannon Hanson. 

However, despite all the preparations, police officers patrolling Panther Hall and the supposed lockdown, none of the evacuation plans were ever set into motion. 

Wassenaar, who was not available for comment until Sept. 6, responded to the rumors of temporary lockdown by stating that students were never told they had to stay in Panther Hall. He also commented that the precautions and warnings were simply safety measures.

Some students agreeded with Wassenaar and said they appreciated the security measures and felt safe staying in housing.

"I think the administration was pretty good about the whole thing...I think it was very responsible of them," said sophomore Andres Camacho.

Amidst the impending threat of Frances and the stress of a slow-moving storm, many students took solace in simpler activities.

"We did a lot of stuff together. We played board games, people came over and we watched TV and movies. I played Playstation when I wasn't doing anything else," Fox said.

Others found the evacuation procedures bewildering but appreciated the efforts of housing staff.

"I think the administration was pretty good about the whole thing. Panther Hall seemed to have some more security measures as compared to other housing; I'm assuming because it's all freshmen. Still, I think it was very responsible of them," said sophomore Andres Camacho.

Headline: Universities watch out for torrent of users
Author: Erika D. Smith / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Who says students don't learn anything over the summer?

Chances are quite a few of them attended the new school of file sharing. They learned all about BitTorrent, and how it's easy to download full movies, CDs, video games and software.

But the University of Akron and Kent State University are prepared.

``We monitor network usage and bandwidth and we respond to complaints,'' said spokesman Paul Herold, summing up UA's strategy.

Kent State isn't much different.

``We know we have a lot of people out there using it,'' said Greg Seibert, Kent State's director of security and compliance.

The university doesn't root out and punish students for using BitTorrent or any other file-sharing network. It does, however, limit how much bandwidth a single student can use. That way the university's high-speed network won't get bogged down by a few users swapping the new Eminem CD.

The only time that changes is when the Recording Industry Association of America slaps Kent State with a cease-and-desist notice. 

Then, the university will block a user's access to the network until he removes all the offending files from his PC.

Last year, Kent State received 45 of those notices _ small potatoes compared to the hundreds and thousands sent to other colleges. No numbers were available Thursday for the University of Akron.

At Kent, more and more of those notices list BitTorrent as the partner in crime, Seibert said.

``They don't understand how it works,'' he said of students. ``They just go to a Web site, and they see movies and they see songs, and they're happy.''

This year, Seibert expects even more students to switch from peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing programs like KaZaA. They are regular targets for lawsuits.

In a way, that's good because BitTorrent tends to manage bandwidth better than its file-sharing cousins, he said. It's incredibly efficient and stable, even though people tend to swap huge files of full-length movies.

That could be behind BitTorrent's growing popularity.

By some measurements, the use of BitTorrent has eclipsed that of KaZaA, the most popular file-sharing program for music. 

A six-month analysis showed BitTorrent accounts for 53 percent of all file-sharing traffic in Europe. 

In June, CacheLogic also reported that about 8 million users were online at any given time sharing a petabyte, or 10 million gigabytes, of data.

``It's much stealthier,'' said Eric Garland, chief executive of the P2P tracking firm BigChampagne LLC.

But buzz aside, BitTorrent is still largely the domain of early adopters in the United States _ typically teen-agers and college students. Much of mainstream America is still taking its legal chances with P2P.

``They feel there really is safety in numbers,'' he said. ``They think, `Yeah, I could get hit by a bus, but I'm not going to.' ''

Headline: Coben's No Second Chance, with conspiracy theories, mayhem yield best seller
Author: Julia Marchese / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Suspense, shock and surprise. With these elements combined, author Harlan Coben created the New York Times best seller entitled No Second Chance. Dr. Mark Seidman endures the an unfathomable pain of his wife being murdered, his daughter vanishing and nearly being murdered himself by an unseen assailant. 

The authorities thought he did, but were unable to fill in the blanks, such as him being shot and nearly meeting his death the day the crime took place.  He is given a chance to find his six month old baby girl, Tara, when a ransom note is delivered to his rich father-in-law. 

It ordered him not to contact the authorities or they would disappear and he would never know what happened to her. They had an inside source, but little did Mark know it was his best friend and lawyer. They wanted two million dollars.  His every move was anticipated and watched. 

When the first ransom drop was made, things went wrong. You'd think that was the end to him seeing his daughter again, but that was only the beginning of Dr. Seidman's hellish reality. 

For eighteen months he agonized over the occurrences in his life. 

He tossed and turned at night replaying that morning in his head and trying to search for reasons or clues.

 As the plot unfolds he begins to realize how wrapped up in his work he had been and failed to address issues in his life, such as his unstable wife's condition. He was forced to analyze his relationship with his depressed wife, family members and ex-girlfriend, Rachel Mills. But more importantly, he evaluated his own manhood.

As the story line thickens, a second ransom note is delivered to his father-in-law requesting another  two million dollars. 

His father-in-law provides him with the large sum of money  in hopes of his granddaughter's safe return home, but has to warn Dr. Seidman of his depleting liquid funds. 

Dr. Seidman decides not to contact the authorities this time. He requested the expertise of former FBI agent and ex-girlfriend from his college days, Rachel Mills. 

They embark on a life altering experience together and repeatedly risked their lives for one another as well as Tara. They bonded and realized their was so much more to their relationship than just the past. 

It's not until the last few pages that everything falls together. From the granola bar he was eating when he was shot to his wife crying at night and the mysterious girl from his childhood who appeared standing on his lawn twice during those eighteen months finally made sense. 

His life was truly flipped upside and changed for the better. While trying to find his daughter he made companions and confronted his feelings for Rachel Mills. 

The irony is that he actually did get a second chance with her. And, he was given a  second chance with his daughter when they were reunited her, leaving readers in tears. 

The title refers to those  who betrayed Dr. Seidman that didn't get a "second chance."

Headline: Polyphonic Spree: From feel good sounds to pastel gowns
Author: Tom Moon / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
The No. 1 question that Tim DeLaughter, leader of the Polyphonic Spree, gets when people see his 25-member group wearing flowing choir robes in pastel colors, and singing unabashedly positive Up With People-ish songs: Is this some kind of a cult?

The second question: Is there room for one more?

"Every show, somebody comes up to us with this look in their eyes, and you just know they want to be in it," DeLaughter said a few weeks back, on the day the Dallas-based band's long-awaited new album, "Together We're Heavy" (Hollywood), arrived in stores. "I mean, they're really serious. They're prepared to relocate. I've got enough people to start three more Polyphonic Sprees right now."

Sure, there's a novelty aspect at work. But the appeal of this mammoth chamber-pop group goes deeper. The 10 singers interpret DeLaughter's earnest songs of faith and devotion like sacred texts, singing in powerful youth-choir unison or simple two-part harmony. The instrumental accompaniment tends toward the florid, with flutes and trombones and multiple keyboards offsetting electric guitars and a traditional rock rhythm section. And the songs are big, epic creations _ sometimes exhibiting a touch of Brian Wilson, or the grandeur of Electric Light Orchestra.

DeLaughter's original idea was simple: "I wanted to create a sound that was appealing to me." The 38-year-old former rocker and father of three, whose band Tripping Daisy put out several acclaimed records in the early `90s, says he had grown bored with the highly formatted songwriting that is the status quo in rock, and the sameness of its instrumental sounds. He wanted to completely change the canvas.

"It's not like I was thinking I needed to have this many singers or anything. It was more about experimenting with something that would never be confused with whatever else was going on. We're so out of the musical climate, I don't think people know what to make of this band."

The songs of "Together We're Heavy" came about through improvisation. DeLaughter would bring in a skeletal idea, and strum the chords while singing what he hears as the melody. 

The musicians, many of whom are classically trained, would fall in around him; they are encouraged to add counter lines or whatever else they hear. 

"Most of these people grew up reading sheet music. At first they'd ask what key and what the chords were, and I had to get them to let go of inhibitions. Now, when we work on material, it's `Let's all just play and see where we go with it.'"

When asked if he purposely leaned in the direction of the idealistic _ if not the celestial _ when writing the Spree's lyrics, DeLaughter referred back to Tripping Daisy. "From when I first started in music to today, the general tone of hope has always been my subject matter. I didn't change my lyrics for the group."

But, in the next breath, he acknowledges that the themes do resonate differently when sung by such a large ensemble: "It works out, conveniently, that having so many people sing gives the lyrics extra weight. And I like that. It's sort of uncharted waters, this very innocent way of talking about being human in these times. 

Some people see it as almost borderline hokey. But to us it's key, because some sort of spirit is there when we perform. And we're not afraid of communicating that."

For the record, DeLaughter says that despite all the spirit talk, the Polyphonic Spree is not a cult. "I haven't adopted a specific religion in the songs. There's no clear-cut agenda." As for the robes, DeLaughter says they're just another way to differentiate his group.

"I was thinking a lot about the way people look at someone's clothes, and they made judgments about what kind of a person they're looking at," DeLaughter says. "That's annoying to me. I wanted something to unify the group, and the first image was white robes, so I went to my mother-in-law, and boom _ right away we made the robes. At first the idea was to project images on the (white robes), but as we've gone along, we're so much more of a band and a family, we've realized there's a lot of vividness, a lot of color. So now each of us wears our own color - we're like pixels on a TV screen."

Headline: Cabin fever hits home
Subheadline: Frances makes Floridians frantic with lockdown boredom
Author: Julia Marchese / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
It's when you've been cooped up in the house for too long. Cabin Fever -we've all experienced it on different levels during the existence of Hurricane Frances last week. Symptoms include talking to yourself, dressing up in your fanciest outfits and getting "tanked." 

The first couple of days aren't so bad. One could use the sleep, especially after being physically drained from boarding up your house and your Grandma's house and waiting in those half a mile long lines at  Publix and your local Shell gas station. Yes, when your head finally hits the pillow, it will be good. 

Your eyes finally open on the third day. But not because the morning sun has casted it's glorious rays upon your face. No, that wouldn't happen because your room is still all boarded up. You fall out of bed and wonder what's for breakfast. The most effortless,   yummiest, non-parishable food item you discover in your kitchen cabinet is of course, Cheerios. After a couple bowls of dry cereal (your mom used up the milk the day before because she didn't want it to spoil due to loss of electricity the hurricane was supposed to incur) and watch some television or those DVDs you rented last week from BlockBuster, something suddenly dawns on you. Where the hell is the hurricane? Shouldn't it already be here? 

You enter the living room where your mom and dad have been residing while you've been asleep in your dungeon. They're not surprised to see you-they've known about your intense sleeping habits since you entered your teen years almost a decade ago. You ask them what happened to Frances, but they're already watching the news so you find out for yourself. She's making her mark in the Bahamas -the category 4 hurricane has been sitting there since yesterday because she's only moving six to nine miles an hour. You sigh in agony because that's 50 miles off the Florida coastline and the monster, twice the size of hurricane Andrew, is still moving toward central Florida. Nobody could be sure if it would shift routes, but they did know Miami would feel Frances's wrath - they just didn't know to what extent. 

Great. you're nap is over. Now what? After having neglected your parents for the last two days you hang out with them for a good while before venturing back into the four walls of your room and pulling the covers over your head. After all, you have no choice but to stay indoors because the hurricane warning is still in effect and the streets are still unsafe. Once you're snuggled back into your queen-sized bed (as comfortable as it is, you're already sick of it and wish there was an alternative to just relaxing all day and night) you turn on the tube and flip to everyone's favorite, MTV, and watch an episode of Room Raiders. After losing interest in the show that followed, Road Rules, you search through your extensive DVD collection. Pulp Fiction, no. Kill Bill, maybe next time. Big Fish, now we're talking. But sleep has made you lazy, and you've fallen asleep half-way through your favorite flick.

It's now 4 a.m. and you're entering the fourth day of being held captive by Frances. Agh, you can't sleep! You slip out of your bed again and fumble through your things, only to realize the mess that you live in. You begin cleaning and organizing your room.  You must be beyond bored to have to result to cleaning. At 7 a.m. your roll continues. Half-an-hour earlier you found that kidnapping, murder mystery book, "No Second Chance."  You decide that now would be a good time to finish it. You cry your eyes out for 20 pages as the father and daughter are reunited.   It's 11 a.m. Downing yet another bowl of dry Cheerios wasn't as easy as it was during the last three days. While you're going through the monotonous routine of eating, the lights are flickering on and off. You think to yourself, "So much for using my computer to finish up that English paper that's due on Tuesday." Your parents gasp in disbelief after seeing your room completely picked up, bed made, and closet color-coordinated. They're proud of you, but at the same time, worried.  You figure that you can't blame them, because everyone's on edge  after being restricted to the confines of the house. So it's been decided for you that cleaning the bathroom would be your next task of the day. You're semi happy that you're being productive. 

After scrubbing the mildew off the grout in between the tiles of the bathroom walls, cleaning the toilet, and wiping the bathroom mirror, you're stuck. You don't know what to do with yourself. "Where are my homies?," you've been wondering all day. You make some phone calls and make sure your friends are still maintaining their sanity.  After reminiscing about your high school days by looking through four years of pictures and then reading a couple chapters in preparation for Tuesday's Psychology class, you make your way back into the bathroom to wash your nappy hair. After doing so, you spend from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. blow drying and ironing your hair. You're growing increasingly restless so you experiment with your makeup. You try on eye shadows of different hues. Time to try on clothes and accessories. You try on your classic, dark red prom dress to see if it still fits you after gaining the freshman 15 a couple years back. You smile. It still fits, instead now you just have more to fill it with. 

After a trying on a few more outfits of different color combinations, you decide it's time to take the plunge. Hurricane Frances -Miami knows it as a girly storm - will no longer get the best you. Besides, the hurricane warning had been lifted earlier that day. You're now well dressed and your hair looks great. You're going out! It doesn't matter where you go, but you're going. You can hear the rain and wind outside, so you decide it'd be best to wear sneakers - you're red Diesels will complement your outfit and look great with your new jeans. You kiss your mom and dad goodbye as they wish well on your first outting in four days in to the outside world. They warn you , "Be careful and cautious of the down power lines." 

You're now turning the knob the of the front door. It finally opens- the experience is euphoric. The light of day is the most beautiful thing you've ever seen, and the air has never smelled so sweet. Who cares if it's raining -you like the rain. You make your way to your '98 blue Saturn as the rain drops dance on your head. You don't even mind that your beautifully-styled hair is getting messed up. By this point, driving feels foreign to you. However, it's never felt like less of a nuisance. And you're grateful because you've survived "Hurricane" Frances and never before has life seemed as blissful
