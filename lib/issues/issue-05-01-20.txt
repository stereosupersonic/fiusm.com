Headline: Hands-on coach and united team end player's long journey

Born in the Ivory Coast, Ismael N'Diaye has found a second home in Miami and has been a key part of the Golden Panthers turn-around this season.

N'Diaye sat down with The Beacon to talk about his goals at FIU and some of his experiences playing basketball since coming to the United States.

Q. You were born in the Ivory Coast. At what age did you move to the U.S. and why?

I moved here when I was 18-years-old because I got a scholarship to attend Berkshire Academy, a prep school in Homestead. I went there for a year-and-a-half. I then went to the University of Miami for a year, attended Los Angeles City College for a year, and then I came back to join FIU.  

Q. Berkshire was a school that was reprimanded for recruiting, correct?

Yes, it was. Basically, I got recruited to go there. When we got caught we could only play against out-of-state teams. 

Q. When did you start playing basketball, and what brought you to the sport?

I started playing basketball when I was about 11 or 12-years-old. It was a couple of American guys who moved into my neighborhood, and they introduced the game to us. I just loved basketball from then on. 

Q. How popular is basketball on the Ivory Coast?

It wasn't really popular at the time I started, but now it's getting really big. Soccer is the number one sport there. 

Q. Did you ever play soccer?

Oh yeah. I played soccer before basketball. Coming from Africa you have to know how to play soccer. That was my first sport, but I like basketball better. 

Q. You were recruited by the University of Miami out of high school, then played junior college ball at Los Angeles City College, and now you find yourself back in Miami playing for FIU. Were all these changes anywhere near your plans three or four years ago?

I would have never expected that. To move and to go to three schools in three years, it was definitely not what I expected coming out of high school. It seems as though everything is coming out well. 

Q. You have the rest of this season and another one next year. What's the plan after your stay at FIU?

First of all, I am going to try and get my degree, and hopefully try and play pro somewhere, maybe overseas. If I could play pro over here that would be even better, but the most important thing is to get my degree. 

Q. What are your expectations, both personally and for the team this season?

Our expectations for the team are to win the Sun Belt. My expectation is to just enjoy the season and have a great year. 

Q. What is the most memorable game you have ever played in high school or college?

My most memorable game was my first time in the U.S. when I was 17-years-old. We went to a tournament in Chicago with my team from back home. I think I scored about 45 points in that game, so I'd say that was the most memorable game of my life. 

Q. How do you like playing for coach Sergio Rouco, and how is he different from other coaches you have had in the past? 

I like him. He is more of a personal guy. He doesn't just care about the team and winning. He cares more about the person than about the team. I know everybody likes that. With most coaches all they care about is their career and not about individuals and their players.

Senior Milena Tomova scored a career-high 43 points to lead the women's basketball team past Denver, 74-59, in Sun Belt Conference action on Jan. 17. Tomova's 43 points are the most by a Division I women's basketball player this season. With the victory, the team improved to 12-5 on the year and 2-2 in Sun Belt Conference play.

Headline: Losing streak hits five in a row for Rouco's team
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Incredible, amazing and ugly. These words describe the Golden Panthers performance against the University of Denver on Jan. 15.

Coach Sergio Rouco's men dropped their fourth straight with a 63-50 loss to the conference rivals.

The loss drops the Golden Panthers to 7-9 on the season and 0-3 in the Sun Belt Conference. Denver moves to 8-6 and into the lead in the Sun Belt West with a 3-0 mark. 

The Golden Panthers struggled from the start and shot poorly all night. 

It was not until Cesar Chavez-Jacobo hit a three at the 12:05 mark of the first half that FIU got on the board. Luckily enough, thanks to quality defense, the Golden Panthers found itself down by only seven. 

FIU shot a miserable 7-33 in the first half and found themselves trailing by 10, 28-18 at the half, despite 14 offensive rebounds. 

Starters Ivan Almonte, Ismael N'Diaye and Junior Matias shot a combined 5-of-24 for 13 points in the opening period. 

Unfortunately for Rouco, the shooting didn't get any better in the second half. 

Almonte shot 3-of-15 for the game and was held to only nine points despite having 15 boards, six of which were on the offensive side of the court.

N'Diaye struggled as well in the second half, finishing the game 4-of-11 from the field.

Matias led the way for the Golden Panthers, finishing the night shooting 6-of-13 for 13 points. 

Rouco seemed shell-shocked following FIU's 34 percent shooting night and knew exactly who should shoulder the blame. 

"It wasn't their defense that stopped us," said Rouco. "It was us not making shots, us being intimidated and us not taking it to them."

Incredibly enough the Golden Panthers out-rebounded the Pioneers 43-27, including a 22-5 edge on offensive boards. 

The Pioneers were led by forward Yemi Nicholson who shot 6-9 from the field, contributing 13 points, 10 of which came in the first half. 

Guard Erik Benzel came alive in the second half for Denver with 15 points, including 4-9 shot from behind the arc. He added eight points from the stripe on a perfect night. 

FIU's 50 points were its second lowest total of the year, just two points ahead of the 48 it scored against the University of Connecticut. 

Attendance at Pharmed Arena just surpassed one thousand on a night that saw the Golden Panthers open their Sun Belt Conference home schedule. 

NORTH TEXAS 68 FIU 60

Another night, same story. 

FIU dropped its fifth game in a row, continuing the team's longest losing streak of the season with a 68-60 loss to North Texas on Jan. 17. 

North Texas started the game shooting 1-of-9 over the first four minutes of play, but the Golden Panthers failed to capitalize, turning the ball over three times. 

The rest of the first half saw turnover after turnover on countless errors by Rouco's team.

"Too many turnovers," said  Rouco. "We had a higher shooting percentage than they did. We out-rebounded, and we still lose."

The Golden Panthers trailed by one, 25-24 at the half, following a sloppy opening session of play. FIU turned the ball over 15 times leading to nine North Texas points.

FIU was led at the half by junior Ivan Almonte who notched 15 points on 6-9 shooting. The Golden Panthers were plagued by a lack of offensive output. Apart from Almonte, no player had more than two points at the half. 

North Texas shot a dismal 8-of-33 from the floor in the opening frame, something that has plagued it all season as it ranks dead last in the Sun Belt Conference in shooting percentage.

Even with the bad shooting, the team took the lead with 7.2 seconds left in the half on a lay-up by junior forward Ron Harris. From then on, it never looked back. 

North Texas leading scorer Leonard Hopkins was limited to just 10 minutes of play and three points in the opening half after quickly accumulating two fouls. 

He shot 7-of-7 from the free throw line the rest of the way and finished the game with a team-high 17 points.  

Mean Green second leading scorer for the season, guard Calvin Watson, was also in double figures for the visitors with 13 points, all of which came after the break. 

FIU clearly missed senior guard Matias, who was a late scratch in the lineup after suffering pain in his left leg following the loss to Denver. Freshmen  Chavez-Jacobo got the start in his place. 

"It was a lack of focus," said forward Sheldon Bailey. "It's not the effort or the system. It's just people putting extra pressure on themselves and trying to do too much."

North Texas Mean Green came out a different team following the break, starting the second half on a 10-0 run.  Hopkins scored six of the 10 points. 

It was not until there was 15:23 left in the game that FIU finally got back on the board.  N'Diaye connected on two free throws to end the Mean Green run.  

N'Diaye came alive in the second half for FIU with 22 points after a first half that saw him manage just two. 

Almonte lead the way for FIU with his seventh double-double of the year with 25 points and 13 rebounds. 

FIU forced 13 turnovers but only capitalized once, while North Texas had 21 points off 26 FIU turnovers, nine of which came in the deciding half. 

FIU drops to 7-10 on the season and 0-4 in the Sun Belt Conference. North Texas moves to its best record since the 1994-95 season at 9-5 and 2-1 in the conference. FIU continues its schedule on Jan.22 in Louisiana, facing conference foe Louisiana-Lafayette. 

The next two home games, against New Mexico State and Arkansas-Little Rock, take place on Jan. 24 and Jan. 30 respectively.

Subheadline: I-A status extention may not give enough time to salvage floundering FIU football attendance 
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The FIU athletic department got big news last week regarding its Division I-A status of the football team. The National Collegiate Athletic Association granted FIU a second transition season of I-A football.

The news came as a surprise to many people because this season FIU did not accomplish the NCAA's mandatory 15,000 minimum average home attendance requirement needed for I-A status. The rule was waived for the first season because FIU had to cancel two games due to Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne striking the coast of Florida, there by disrupting the play schedule and attendance.

The NCAA board will vote in April on whether FIU will need to accomplish the requirement next season. If the rule is not eliminated, it is difficult to imagine that FIU will reach the 15,000 requirement. The team averaged 10,095 in home attendance last season. The only reason it even reached that amount was because the final game was played at the Orange Bowl and the majority of the people there (21,010) went to see FAMU's marching band perform at halftime.

No game played at the FIU stadium drew more than 10,022 fans, and that was the opener. Not even the concert by Method Man and Redman could pack the stadium. FIU spent an estimated $90,000 on the rappers in order to draw fans, but once again FIU couldn't get students to the stadium. Attendance actually declined from the first game of the season to the concert game, with 1,565 less fans attending the concert game. The game after the concert, drew 581 less people. Was it worth it to spend $90,000? Was that $90,000 originally from student fees? It seems clear that  FIU's return on investment (ROI) is questionable at best.

FIU will continue to give thousands of promotional giveaways next season and maybe a special concert or two, but in order to draw fans. the team must have a winning season.

All games played at FIU stadium were losses. If you don't count the Orange Bowl game, FIU would have averaged 7,366 instead of 10,095. The figure is so low because the final game at FIU Stadium against Western Kentucky drew only 3,108. 

FIU will play two very good football teams next season in Texas Tech and Kansas State. The team will also play a full Sun Belt Conference schedule. The Golden Panthers will face their toughest competition yet.

The bottom line is that Miami is a win-driven town. The Marlins didn't start drawing more fans to the stadium until the team began winning. The Miami Heat had to bring Shaq from the Lakers in order to pack the arena.

If the average home attendance requirement of at least 15,000 people is voted into effect for next season, FIU is in big trouble. FIU has yet to defeat a I-A team in three seasons of play. The scary thing is that every team on schedule next season is I-A. Wins will be even tougher to get. If the team does not reach the attendance requirement, it will have to once again begin a two-year transition or opt not to join Division I, which is unlikely, considering the way FIU has pushed the feat.

Headline: Rushed Iraqi election hazards may outweigh freedom benefits
Author: Dara Bramson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When someone says "Iraq," distinct images and feelings flood my mind. I think of war, blood, fear and chaos, not to mention the large part of the U.S.'s economy that revolves around the remote country. 

The date for Iraq's first election under free rule is Jan. 30. Though I strongly believe in freedom of speech, I question whether Iraq is ready to handle a voting situation. 

Provided that the U.S., a country so indigenous in its roots, can barely handle an election - how will Iraq?

The purpose of the vote in Iraq is to elect a 275 member national assembly that will construct a contemporary constitution. Out of Iraq's estimated 12 million voters, the census is likely far from correct. Because of time constraints, instead of conducting a proper census, the electoral rolls are being based on the United Nation's "Oil for Food" lists, which were calculated in the 1990s by Saddam Hussein's regime. 

Accurate? Far from it! Reportedly, many on the voters list may even be deceased. There could be millions of new voters that have become eligible since the last census. 

Additionally, it is speculated that little or no voting will take place in some provinces.An additional 4,000 security troops, including the National Guard and regular army troops, have been added to the predominant voting areas. 

Amid heavy military presence, there is still much concern for danger. 

According to BBC News (bbc.co.uk), reports have confirmed that people opposing the election have already torched election materials and made death threats to election workers. 

According to CNN, officials even stated that Iraqis who want to vote could face intimidation. "Polls could be threatened," said a CNN spokesman. "Iraqis could be followed and attacked as they return home from voting." It seems as if nobody is completely confident about the safety of the election. 

Even U.S. Army Brigade General Carter Ham said, that if Iraqi security forces find themselves in a situation beyond their capability, then multi-national forces will be postured and prepared and well-rehearsed to reinforce those Iraqi security forces. 

Perceptibly, any significant political issue is always down-played to decrease panic. 

If the U.S. government was completely open and honest with the American people during 2001, the Sept. 11 attacks probably would not have come as much of a shock. 

Understandably, the world would be chaotic if everybody knew everything. However, I do believe that small hints can give us insight into the bigger picture. When a knowledgeable authority makes a statement about the preparation for additional troops, I interpret that as him saying "when needed" rather than "if needed."

At what point should an authority decide to postpone the election? With all the casualties from the war, it seems to me that carrying out an election should not take precedent over the risk of losing more lives. I do not think I would risk my life just to vote with such high risks. 

Regardless of the danger that Iraq may face due to the election, the officials are relentless. According to a CNN report, Iraqi and U.S. officials have vowed not to delay the Jan. 30 election. To increase security measures as much as possible, a three-day travel ban has even been considered. Even with the uncertainty of the consequences of the election, officials seem to be taking as many positive steps as possible toward making the election a success. 

They even secured Iraqi women political representation. To guarantee that at least 25 percent of the seats in the elected assembly go to women, every third name must be that of a woman. 

Individuals with a petition of as few as 500 signatures are allowed to run. 

This can potentially bring new, optimistic voices into the Iraq government.

I am completely supportive of a country taking the necessary steps to become a free society. However, the dangers involved in the Iraq election seem to overpower the importance of getting the election done so quickly. Furthermore, even if the election is carried out, will the constitution be realistically implemented with Iraq in the condition it is in? Although the election in Iraq has the potential to be dangerous, we can only hope that it will bring positive changes for the Iraqi people.

New intelligence reports raise questions about U.S. mission in Iraq

A series of new U.S. intelligence assessments on Iraq paints a grim picture of the road ahead and concludes that there's little likelihood that President Bush's goals can be attained in the near future.

Instead of stabilizing the country, national elections Jan. 30 are likely to be followed by more violence and could provoke a civil war between majority Shiite Muslims and minority Sunni Muslims, the CIA and other intelligence agencies predict, according to senior officials who've seen the classified reports.

A new public report by the National Intelligence Council concludes that instead of diminishing terrorism, U.S.-occupied Iraq has replaced prewar Afghanistan as a breeding and training ground for terrorists who may disperse to conduct attacks elsewhere.

Two senior intelligence officials with access to classified reporting said Islamic militants allied with or inspired by Osama bin Laden were forging ties to Iraqi nationalists and remnants of former dictator Saddam Hussein's regime. The linkage is similar to the one that so-called "Afghan Arabs" formed with Afghanistan's Taliban regime after the Soviet Union withdrew from that country, they said.

"The sad thing is we have created what the administration claimed we were intervening to prevent: an Iraq/al-Qaida linkage," one of the senior intelligence officials said.

The United States faces an agonizing choice, they say, because an American withdrawal would hand militant Islam a huge victory and probably doom the transitional.

Another possibility is that the transitional government, expected to be dominated by Shiites, could give the United States a timetable to leave. The White House and State Department have said such a request would be honored.

Even with the new intelligence reports, Bush has given no sign that he plans to change approaches in Iraq and has declined to set his own timeline for American troops to withdraw.

More children killed in tsunami than first thought, aid workers fear



Relief workers are finding fewer children in camps for tsunami refugees than they'd hoped and fear that children make up an even greater percentage of the dead than was estimated earlier.

Hard numbers are difficult to come by. Relief workers originally estimated that children made up 3 of every 10 people killed when an earthquake triggered a tsunami that swept the coasts of 12 countries Dec. 26.

But as relief workers canvass camps in Indonesia to tally the number of children, they're beginning to reassess their first estimates.

"In all the camps, the number of children is low," said Frederic Sizaret, a child-protection officer with the United Nations Children's Fund, better know as UNICEF.

Relief workers hope for a more accurate picture of the child death toll later this month, when schools reopen and they can compare this year's enrollment with last year's.

 Experts originally calculated that children comprised about 30 percent of victims because that's their relative proportion in the general population, Knudsen said. When relief officials first arrived in Indonesia, they thought they'd find thousands of children either orphaned or missing one of their parents, and many lost children being cared for by other adults.

 Workers in Aceh province have collected 84,637 bodies so far, with as many as 132,000 more people missing, most of whom, three weeks after the tsunami, aren't expected to be found alive. Officials haven't said how many of those are children.

Headline: SPOTLIGHT ON
Subheadline: UP Copy Center
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Signs that classes have once again begun are usually clear at FIU: the rush to buy books for the lowest prices, new students milling around University Park Graham Center and the Biscayne Bay Campus Wolfe University Center trying to find their classrooms and students at kiosks printing their schedules at the last minute.

However, a sight that is often overlooked, despite its occurrence every semester, is the swarm of students that pack into the UP Copy Center to purchase made-to-order textbooks and manuals, print the semester's first assignments or photocopy a friend's notes.

"The beginning and end of the semester are always our busiest times," said Joanna Ervin, the Copy Center's manager. "We have to work overtime, especially at the start, when students are just getting to know the campus and their teachers and have a lot of [assignments] to turn in."

The Copy Center, located next to the Panther Stop on the first floor in GC, has been operating at FIU for almost eight years. Photocopies, though, are not the only services it provides.

Besides offering access to various self-service photocopy machines, the center also offers text binding and mailbox rental. It will laminate paper and frame wall art, including the art for sale on its own walls. The center also has faxing services and is the only place at UP from which students can ship outgoing mail via Federal Express.

"We've been adding services ever since we started, looking out for students' demands and concerns," Ervin said.

James Bier, an FIU student upset by the lack of efficient photocopy machines at the school, founded the center in 1998.

According to Ervin, Bier needed to make photocopies for a paper after one of his classes and realized that he had to get in his car and probably lose his parking space to waste time to go off campus to make his copies.

Bier opened the first Copy Center with his father, Joseph Bier, at BBC, but due to lack of business, it closed in 2000 and relocated to the UP spot it still occupies.

BBC opened its own smaller copy center after the first center's departure, a unit called the Panther Print and Mail, located in WUC 135, that offers photocopying and printing. It also has a postal service and sells shuttle bus passes.

While catering to the FIU community, the UP center is not owned or operated by the university and remains a family business.

"When students ask us what we're all about, we tell them that the main theme of our business is service," said Joseph Bier, who helps at the center as a technician.

Though the tiny room can sometimes get packed with students and faculty trying to make photocopies, Ervin says that the center, no matter how limited its space may be, is still the best option for FIU.

"It's the convenience factor they're after-that we're here, and they don't have to go off campus," she said. "They can just get it done, get in and get out, and we try to accommodate everyone as best we can."

Headline: FIU professor exposes undiscovered ingredient in OTC drug
Author: Michelle M. Arean / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU Professor Albert Sabucedo, Ph.D., found that the dietary supplement, Actra-RX, also known as Yilishen, is not 100 percent natural, as it claims to be, but contains large amounts of sildenafil citrate, the active ingredient found in Viagra. This could be lethal to some.

The professor began his research, which exposed Body Basics, the manufacturer of these dietary supplements containing sildnafil citrate, when former FIU student Mauricio Gutierrez brought his concerns about the pills to Sabucedo's attention.  

"Mauricio is the brainchild behind all of this," said Sabucedo. "Sometimes you just have to listen to the little people." 	

Actra-RX used to be known as Niagra, a product that promotes sexual enhancement, but after Body Basics was sued by Pfizer Inc., the company that produces Viagra, a small, white sticker was added to each label to cover the name.

Actra-Rx has the same amount of sildenafil as Viagra, which is legally available by prescription  only in the U.S. People who are taking nitrates for conditions such as diabetes, blood pressure and many heart conditions, such as angina, should not take Viagra. 

Actra-RX does not contain a warning label. Yet, advertisement for the pill states: "People who suffer from high blood pressure or diabetes may take it without a problem." Actra-RX can be lethal when combined with many prescription medications containing nitrates. Many patients who suffer from these diseases find that erectile dysfunction is often also a condition they must deal with. 

"The label on the bottle just says you're taking amino acids, which aren't FDA approved, because it's like taking regular vitamins," said Sabucedo. "If someone with chest pain takes this dietary supplement, it can send his or her blood pressure to plummet to cardiac arrest."

An article by HealthDay.com quotes a letter by the chairman of the board of Body Basics, Frank Estrada, stating: "The manufacturer has unequivocally assured us that Actra-Rx DOES NOT contain sildenafil." 

The article also states that Pfizer Inc. sued Body Basics two years ago, claiming that the product contained sildenafil citrate. The two parties settled out of court, and as part of the settlement Body Basics was no longer able to use the name Niagra.

Sabucedo's research ultimately caused the Food and Drug Administration to recall Actra-RX, yet it took them about a year to act after his initial letter reporting his findings. 

In November, the FDA issued a warning against Actra-RX for containing an undeclared prescription drug ingredient. A month later, they issued an urgent recall. 

Sabucedo plans to continue researching the product until he can prove that the lethal ingredient has been removed or at least a warning sign is added to the bottle.

Subheadline: Competing for Miss FIU title
Author: Rodolfo R. Roman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The seven contestants of the Second Annual Miss Florida International University Pageant strutted their stuff as they circled the stage showing their beautiful smiles and looks to impress the five judges. 

The event was held at the University Park Graham Center Ballroom on Jan. 15.

Over one hundred family members and friends attended the event to cheer on their favorite beauty. Many family members held pictures with the names of their preferred contestant that read, "...for 2005 Miss FIU." 

Many important individuals of the beauty pageant world witnessed the event, such as Aaron Fowler, former Miss West Palm Beach, Aaron Fowler and  Mary Sullivan executive director of the Miss Florida Scholarship program.

Also in attendance was the first Miss FIU, Merissa Amkraut, who gave two violin performances with her brother Ross, as well as a farewell speech. Later that night, Amkraut was acclaimed for representing FIU and received a standing ovation when she gave her final walk as Miss FIU.  

"Being part of Miss FIU and Miss America, offered me scholarship money," said Amkrunt. "I judged many FIU events and was a part of them. Also, I represented FIU at the Miss Florida Pageant and placed in the top 15." 

This year's pageant, had fewer competitors, but according to Allison L. Choban, the executive director of the second Annual Miss FIU Pageant,  it was more successful than last year's. 

"We really had a lot of help from the students and the university. Student government funded most of the pageant," said Choban. "Even though we had fewer competitors, this year's event went a lot smoother. I feel that with the help of the university, the pageant will grow."

The seven contestants that competed for the grand prize of $750 in scholarship money, a trophy and gift certificates included: Mfonobong Essiet,  Chrissie Fit, Evelyn Danford,  Rachel Louissaint, Annabelle Delgado, Megan Alonge, and  Robyn Luck.  

As part of the grand prize contestants competed for a chance to represent FIU at this year's Miss America pageant which will be held at the Miami-Dade County Auditorium on June 26 - July 2.

"The beauty pageant is important for FIU because she [Miss FIU] will be an ambassador to the school," said Choban. "She will represent us in Miss Florida and in Miss America."

Contestants were judged on their answers to interview questions, a talent competition, their modeling of nightgown wear and on a lifestyle and fitness competition. 

After the process of evaluation and the final drum roll, Megan Alonge was announced the winner of the pageant with first runner-up Evelyn Danford.

"I am very excited and glad that I will be able to represent FIU," said Alonge. "I began competing about five years ago, when I wanted to set my platform and center myself as a public speaker to promote my blood donation program."  

In addition to the crowning of Miss FIU, the Mistress of Ceremonies, Miami Heat dancer Kelly Gaudet, announced the winner of a raffle in which the audience participated. The winner received $69, half of what was raised from the raffle tickets. The other $69 went to the new Miss FIU.

Aside from what people speculate about beauty pageants, there seemed to be peace behind the curtains of the stage throughout the entire night.

"I have met some remarkable young women throughout competing in this business. I have even attended a few weddings of one of my closest friends, in which I met in this program. I would really say there is no jealousy, because we help each other and we all want one of us to succeed," said Armkraut.

As for next year's event, Choban said, "I don't have any plans yet, but it will go on. For now, I just need some sleep."

Headline: This spring, fashion slips into moccasins
Author: Emily Jacque / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The new year is overflowing with glitz and glam, and the catch phrase for designers this season seems to be "all that glitters is gold." Metallic shades are in, such as silver, gold and bronze, while dull, fall colors are out. 

Wherever you turn you will find a shiny bag and matching shoes, especially in such a fashionable city like Miami. 

Fur has also become very big this season, even though in Florida's ever-sunny weather, coats seem more like a curse than a blessing. 

However, the soft detail of real or faux fur is appearing on all sorts of accessories from boots to bags. 

In the business world, shoes, of course, are probably the most important part of a girl's wardrobe. For the casual work environment, moccasins are definitely in, not only in typical shades, such as beige or brown, but also in bright colors like teal and hot pink; they can also come embellished with fringe or beads. Bakers offers these stylish new shoes for a mere $39.95. 

"I love my moccasins. They are the most comfortable shoes in my closet next to my sneakers," said law student Amy Klose.

Moroccan and Indian inspired slippers have become all the rage this season. They are not only popular, but also very practical and can be dressed up or down with jeans or a simple tank top. Pointy or round toed, these flat and exotic shoes come beaded or embroidered in nearly every vibrant color of the spectrum. 

"Beaded shoes help accentuate all my outfits. They give me that special little something," said freshman Beena Kazi. 

For the classic American sweetheart look, western inspired styles have made cowboy boots trendy. They are available in a wide variety of styles, materials and colors. For those who feel this look may be too eccentric, pair calf-length boots with jeans.

Keep it simple; one western themed item will yield the best results. If paired with a skirt of a moderate length, they will add a little bit of style to an already sophisticated look.

Whether you prefer the glitz and glam of metallic colors or the classic cowboy look, adding a little personal style to every outfit will give you that special je ne sais qoui.

Headline: Local-made documentary nominated for Grammy
Author: Marilyn Mederos / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On Jan. 20th, the Hearst Distinguished Lecture series will present The Language of Music. The forum will include Miami filmmaker Mark Moormann and Allan Richards, FIU Journalism and Broadcasting interim chairman. 

Together they will discuss the life and work of legendary producer/recording pioneer Tom Dowd, compare interviewing techniques, view parts of the documentary "Tom Dowd & The Language of Music," and play excerpts from Dowd's 40 years of music.  

Moormann directed, produced and edited, "Tom Dowd & The Language of Music," which is currently nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Long Form Music Video category. 

Moormann's past documentaries include, "Once Upon a Time on South Beach," "Hidden Rivers of the Maya" and "Moonlighting in Haiti." He has worked on music videos for artists such as Aerosmith, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Michael Jackson. 

"I've interviewed and been in recording studios with a lot of rock stars, but Dowd was a wizard . . . and [an anomomaly in] the music industry, which is littered with geniuses, crazies and slime balls," said Richards. "He was a real, nice guy."

Dowd majored in physics at Columbia University, where he was drafted into the Manhattan Project and the South Pacific to conduct atomic bomb tests. He then held a summer job during his high school years with a recording company that lead to a partnership with Atlantic Records. 

However, Dowd wanted to help the process of music recording. He soon began to work in binaural stereo recording and designed the eight-track console. Dowd worked with esteemed artists such as John Coltrane, Eric Clapton, Ray Charles and many more. 

He received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award shortly before his Death in 2002.

In a 1994 Sun-Sentinel cover story, Richards wrote, "If you have bought a record, a cassette or a CD in the last four decades, whether it contains Ben E. King's 'Stand By Me,' Aretha Franklin's 'Natural Women,' Cream's 'Sunshine of Your Love' or a number of other hit songs, odds are you are already on good terms with the music of Tom Dowd."

The presentation is open to the public and is free. It will begin at 6 p.m. in the Wolfe University Center Ballroom at the Biscayne Bay Campus. Movie trailers for "Tom Dowd & The Language of Music" can be viewed at www.thelanguageofmusic.com. 

"I'm looking forward to attending the lecture [about] Tom Dowd that will be held in FIU. I don't know much about Tom Dowd, so I want to see parts of the documentary. I love many different types of music," said junior Diana Vargas. 

The documentary will air on the Sundance Channel throughout the month of January.

Headline: Miami Film Festival
Author: Shane Howard / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Miami Dade College has a long, rich history of involvement in the cultural arts, providing South Florida with events such as The Miami International Book Fair, Cultura del Lobo and The Cuban Cinema Series. It is also home to the School of Entertainment and Design Technology. 

That involvement will continue this February when the college will present the 22nd Annual Miami International Film Festival, Feb. 4-13.

"The 2005 Miami International Film Festival will bring us a program that explores where and who we are in the world, our place not only here in South Florida, but also in the Americas and beyond," said MDC president, Eduardo Padron. He said the festival will "foster greater awareness and acceptance of the diversity that enriches our entire community."

The film festival gives a wide range of cultural perspectives by showcasing films from all over the world. 

"We are pleased to announce a richly diverse slate of films, all of which are eminently worthy of this year's festival," said Festival Director, Nicole Guillemet.

118 films - 87 features and 31 shorts - from 47 countries will be shown. At this year's MIFF, screenings will take place at six locations throughout the city: The Gusman Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Miami, Regal South Beach Cinema in South Beach, Tower Theater in Little Havana, Sunrise Intracoastal Cinema in North Miami Beach, Bill Cosford Cinema at the University of Miami in Coral Gables and the Wolfsonian-FIU in Miami Beach.

Mick Davis' "Modigliani" (UK), starring Andy Garcia ("Ocean's Twelve," "The Untouchables"), will open the 10-day event. Garcia takes on the role of Amedeo Modigliani whose passions fuel his work but consume his soul as he dares to challenge Pablo Picasso in defining the cubist art movement.

Day two will see the premiere of Rebecca Miller's "The Ballad of Jack and Rose" (US), starring Daniel Day-Lewis ("Gangs of New York," "Last of the Mohicans") and Catherine Keener ("Full Frontal," "Death to Smoochy"). The movie focuses on a man who has isolated himself from a world he feels has not lived up to his ideals, while his 16-year-old daughter tries to find her place in it. 

Another highly-anticipated film is Charles Dante's "Ladies in Lavender" (UK), starring Dames Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. The period drama follows two elderly sisters whose prim and proper lives are disturbed and sexual fantasies are awakened by the arrival of a young Jewish violinist played by Daniel Bruhl. It premiers Feb. 10 at the Gusman Center.

The drama "Live-In Maid" (Argentina), is director Jorge Gaggero's story of a well-to-do socialite who refuses to let go of her maid or her gold earrings, despite financial problems that cause her to sell door-to-door beauty products. It premiers Feb. 9 at the Regal South Beach Cinema at 1 p.m.

On Feb. 8, MIFF will honor Liv Ullman with the Career Achievement Tribute for her distinguished body of work as both actor and director. The festival will also honor Jean Rouch as it presents a celebration of his life and films in partnership with the University of Miami and the French Consulate. The celebration will include a symposium, panel discussions and screenings of Rouch's films at the Cosford Theater.

Guillemet has also announced that The Big Picture: Theater of Truth will return for its third year. Theater of Truth uses films such as Luis Mandoki's "Innocent Voices" (Mexico) to focus on world issues and the fight for life and dignity. 

The drama tells the true story of an eleven-year-old boy in 1980 El Salvador who suddenly becomes the man of the house after his father abandons the family in the middle of a civil war. 

Francois Prevost and Hugo Latulippe's "What Remains of Us" (Canada/Tibet) tackles the crucial topic of individual and collective responsibility by examining three generations of Tibetans who, despite the loss of 1.2 million of their fellow citizens, have refused to yield to violence. It premiers on Feb. 11 at 6 p.m. at the Bill Cosford Cinema.

Tickets can be purchased at www.miamifilmfestival.com or by calling 305-405-MIFF or in person at the venue where the film will be screened on the day of its premiere. Student tickets are $7 with a valid student ID. However, make sure to get there on time, because seating for ticket holders is guaranteed for only 10 minutes before seats are sold to those in the "Rush" ticket line.
