FIU announced that, due to budget cuts and academic priorities, it will no longer be the sole presenting sponsor of the Miami International Film Festival.

In a notice to the university community, Mark Rosenberg, FIU provost and executive vice president, first announced the decision "as a consequence of our determination to forge ahead with our vision to be a nationally competitive public research university."

FIU accepted responsibility of the festival five years ago in hopes that it would significantly contribute to the addition of a film school at the university. In turn, FIU planned to "return the festival to break even over a period of years. Sept. 11 and the economic slowdown changed all that," Rosenberg said.

According to Terry Witherell, assistant vice president of External Relations, FIU maintains that it does not want to simply back away from the festival, because it is an asset to the community. 

FIU is currently exploring other prospective sponsors for the festival, primarily Miami-Dade College. 

Because of its School of Entertainment Technology, Miami-Dade already has the academic component that would most likely benefit from the film festival. Plans are underway for the execution of the 2004 festival, scheduled for Jan. 30 through Feb. 8, indicating that the film festival will continue as a Miami treasure.

College of Engineering offers new graduate programs 

The College of Engineering is now offering graduate students the option of obtaining a master's degree in either technology management or telecommunications and networking, two new programs made available at the FIU Pines Center in Pembroke Pines.

The telecommunications and networking program encompasses courses about software, management, policy, engineering and domestic and international telecommunications issues. It intends to teach students how to lead in such fields as information networking, electronic commerce and mobile, wireless and optical strategies. The technology management program will specialize in information technology, combined with courses on marketing management, operations management and decision-making.Both programs require a bachelor's degree in engineering, information systems, technology, sciences or other closely related fields from an accredited institution, and a minimum 3.0 grade point average.

For more information about the two new programs, students can visit the engineering center online at www.eng.fiu.edu or RSVP with program coordinator Linda Trujillo at pineseng@fiu.edu to attend one of the upcoming information sessions that will be conducted from the Pines Center on Sept. 13, Sept. 24, and Oct. 4.

'Bike for Freedom' honors family and victims of 9/11

The Alpha Phi Sigma National Honor Society for Criminal Justice and the Honors Council at FIU hosted and sponsored the second annual "Bike for Freedom" on Sept. 6, in memory of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Participants rode their bikes from FIU University Park campus to the Biscayne Bay campus. 

"Everyone is always welcome to show their solidarity with the families that lost their loved ones that tragic day," said Josie Ashton, organizer of the event. 

"We hope to make [Bike for Freedom] a tradition, an annual event, and have more participants that may want to join us to honor the victims of 9/11."

Before the ride, scheduled to start at 8:45 a.m., a quick breakfast was served at the Golden Panther Arena.  The 24-mile ride had only one stop, at Bayfront Park, for refreshments, prior to arriving at BBC shortly before noon. Police escorts were provided for the safety of riders, as well as public transportation for their return to the UP campus. Other sponsors included The Advocate Program, Public Safety, and the Student Government Association.

Headline: Freshman 15: merely a myth?
Subheadline: Snacks, stress pack on pounds for some college entrants
Author: Geoffrey A. Campbell/ Knight Rider Tribune Newspapers
&nbsp;
FORT WORTH, Texas - Yolanda Davis heard about the dreaded phenomenon before heading off to New Orleans for her freshman year at Xavier University and wanted no part of it. Wendy Moses had likewise heard the tales before settling in as a freshman at Emory University in Atlanta but never imagined it would happen to her.

The two Fort Worth, Texas, women found themselves face to face with the so-called Freshman 15, the alleged propensity of students to put on up to 15 pounds when they first go off to college. Whether established fact or national folklore remains an open question, but for many of the roughly 1.5 million young people who enter college each fall, the Freshman 15 becomes a living, breathing reality.

As a scientifically proven phenomenon, the Freshman 15 has taken its lumps in recent years. "It depends on the school and individual," said Kelly Simonson, a licensed psychologist at the counseling center at Texas Woman's University in Denton. "An equal number of people lose weight."

According to Simonson, a school's culture can be a factor in whether students will gain weight. 

"At TWU, you'll see every size and shape of woman on the planet," she said. "But at a place like Southern Methodist University in Dallas, there are more social pressures to be thin."

Jeanne Goldberg, a professor at Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston, said, "It's a catchphrase - nice alliteration. But it's not true."

Goldberg said she looked at the issue 15 years ago and found that freshmen did gain a few pounds. At the end of four years, however, those same students had lost weight and weighed roughly the same as when they started college.



A new study



More recently, researchers at Tufts conducted another study. They found that freshmen women gained an average of 4 pounds their first year in school, while freshmen men gained an average of 6. 

"The reason I'm concerned about the 4 pounds of weight for women is that, in the context of the national obesity epidemic, will they lose those 4 pounds or will it be a trajectory?" Goldberg said. She added that researchers will continue to follow up to track the weight of study subjects. Tufts recently sent out its first alumni weight survey.

Whether it is 4, 6 or 15 pounds, people on college campuses say it is not uncommon for some students to gain considerable weight during their first year. Reggie Bond, executive director of the Health and Wellness Center at the University of North Texas in Denton, said he has heard about the fabled Freshman 15 since he first entered the college environment. However, he said he doubts that it happens to most students.

"You do have a few students who gain a lot of weight," he said. "But this does not seem to be true for a majority of students."

Benita Jacobs, vice president of student development at UNT, concurs. 

"We joke about it a lot, and, anecdotally, you see a lot of kids who put on weight because they eat more and they eat differently than they did at home," she said. "If I had to guess, I'd say a number of students do put on weight after they first go to college. But whether it is as many as in the past, I doubt it because people are so much more health-conscious today."



Stressed out



Monica Kintigh, a licensed professional counselor with mental health services at Fort Worth's Texas Christian University, said a constellation of factors contribute to freshman weight gain. 

"It's a transition time," she said. `It's not just the stress of college. Now, for the first time, they have to do their own laundry and get their own meals."

In addition, some students fret about the financial burden their schooling places on their families. Others worry about their social lives, wondering who their new friends will be and how they will fit in on campus. Such radical changes can lead some students to feel blue.

"When we feel bad, we go for comfort foods," Kintigh said, foods often laden with fat and calories.

Food at college residence halls also has been fingered as a culprit in freshman weight gain. However, colleges and universities have become increasingly sophisticated in the fare they offer. 

"Now there is such a variety of food offered at each of the residence halls," said UNT's Bond, ranging from sub sandwiches to vegetarian dishes.



Eating disorders



Counselors and nutrition experts caution that, while college weight gain can be a problem, a number of people develop serious eating disorders as they attempt to avoid gaining weight. 

"Some people are so afraid of gaining the Freshman 15 that they become bulimic or anorexic," said Kintigh of TCU.

Bulimics follow periods of excessive overeating with self-induced vomiting, while anorexia is an obsession with losing weight by refusing to eat. The numbers can be staggering. Simonson said that up to 20 percent of all women on college campuses exhibit some sort of eating-disorder behavior.

For her part, Moses has remained philosophical about her weight gain. 

"Everyone is weight-conscious, but everyone gains the Freshman 15," she said. "I gained the weight, and I know I can lose it."



Fight the Fat



Counselors and nutrition experts say freshman weight gain need not be inevitable. Some do's and don'ts:

- Exercise regularly. Many schools have sophisticated recreation centers that include swimming pools, tracks, exercise equipment and fitness classes.

- Avoid snacking on fatty foods. Stock up on fresh fruits, vegetables and other healthy alternatives.

- Monitor food consumption. Many school-food programs allow students unlimited portions, but the food will still be there tomorrow.

- Seek out nutrition counselors and personal trainers.

- Limit alcohol intake.

- Get enough sleep.

These common-sense tips can go a long way toward avoiding the "Freshman 15." Amy Goodson, wellness coordinator at the Texas Christian University recreation center, said keeping the weight off is "a combination of healthy living and healthy choices." Many students, fall into a trap of staying up late, snacking and drinking alcohol, which "really adds the pounds," she said.

Headline: Partners for Kids helps orphaned teenagers
Author: By Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's Americorps program hosted its second Partners for Kids family fair in the Golden Panther Arena Aug. 30 to reward a total of 150 to 200 local high school students, many of whom are orphans, for their efforts in the Partners for Kids program this summer.

"The purpose of the carnival was to congratulate students for their hard work in this summer's Partners for Kids program," said Allison Grande, director of the Americorps program at FIU.

This summer's Partners for Kids program, run by FIU Americorps members, targeted orphaned Miami-Dade County public high school students. Americorps members who participated traveled to these orphaned teenagers' homes and coached them on matters that are necessary for high school and beyond.

"Their main areas of focus were academic skills, filling out college and job applications, and also the FAFSA," Grande said. "[The fair is] a way for the kids to see how much they're cared about."

Attendees of the fair included students from local high schools such as Miami Carol City High School and Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School. Representatives from a few middle schools were also present. A small percentage of the attendees were either mentally handicapped or homeless. 

Some of the parents of these students also came to the fair, which was not open to the public. In addition to FIU's Americorps, members of some campus sororities as well as random volunteers offered their assistance to make sure the day went smoothly. 

Students began arriving at the fair by 8:30 a.m.  After a brief processional at 10:00 a.m., guest speaker James Amps III, author of the self-motivation book "Speaking to Excel", took the stage.

"I spoke to the kids about focusing on a goal, being committed to it and seeing it through to the end," Amps said. He drew on his own life experiences in the navy.

The fair gave the students the opportunity to create spin art, use name beads, simulate sumo wrestling, and advance up a rock-climbing wall, among other activities throughout the day. 

"There was also [simulated] bull riding, caricaturists and laser tag," said Jessica Smith, a participating Americorps member. 

For lunch, students were treated to hotdogs and hamburgers free-of-charge, courtesy of Longhorn Steakhouse. And one corner of the arena housed an operational popcorn and cotton candy stand.

Seminars were held in selected rooms of the Golden Panther Arena for the parents of students who attended the event. One such program, hosted by Sophia Santiesteban, director of FIU's Upward Bound program, highlighted the various options students have once they graduate from high school. Others covered topics such as study skills and learning to read well.

Grande is currently trying to get the orphaned high school students at the event qualified for a state program known as the "Road to Independence." If the students qualify, said Grande, the state will pay for all of their educational and living costs, which include tuition and housing, during their college career. 

"The only requirement for orphaned students seeking this grant is a 2.0 high school grade point average," said Grande.

This year's fair attendance was nearly double that of last year's attendance of  100 people. Last year's fair was held at Biscayne Bay Campus in Wolfe University Center.  The difference in attendance may be attributed to the fact that the BBC fair was not geared toward a specific crowd like this year's was towards orphaned children, Grande said. Due to a lack of funding at the national and state levels, this will be the last year of the Americorps program at FIU, said Grande. The program will officially end in December.

Headline: MDC's four-year program may compete with FIU
Author: Krystal Alvarez/ Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Miami-Dade Community College changed its name to Miami-Dade College after approval last year from the Board of Education and the Southern Association of Colleges to offer a four-year baccalaureate degree education program.

With the addition of the program, the school may provide FIU's  College of Education with some unexpected competition.

The MDC School of Education offers degrees in exceptional student education (grades K - 12), math (grades 6 - 12), and science (grades 6 - 12). 

Although the school is not accredited like FIU's College of Education, it is being observed by the SACS committee for the possibility of future accreditation.

According to Sherilyn W. Poole, assistant director for Student Services at the School of Education at MDC, the reason the education program was chosen was because of the shortage of teachers and state data that displays that  MDC transfers (in education) have a higher cumulative GPA (3.24 compared to 3.06 for SUS native student) and 60 percent of MDC transfers graduate with a bachelor's degree compared to 51 percent of those who started in a four year school with the program.

"The critical teachers shortage nationally, and in South Florida, and the success of MDC's graduates who have transferred to four-year institutions to complete their education degrees  made education the appropriate program to extend to a four-year degree," said Poole.

There are only 129 students enrolled as of yet in the four-year program, whereas the College of Education at FIU has approximately 2,000 students. 

 This might mean that future students, who would usually transfer to universities like FIU after completing their associate's degree at MDC, would rather stay at MDC in order to complete their bachelor's degree, according to Poole. 

"MDC students now have the option of staying in college, which is familiar to them, and continue to work with and learn from, the same faculty members who have taught them in the first two years of their college experience," said Poole. 

Students may choose to go with an older, bigger program at the FIU College of Education. 

The College of Education has been around since the 70s, making it one of FIU's oldest colleges. 

It is a larger school with approximately 90 full-time faculty members.  

There are twelve different program to choose from.

It offers various degrees in different areas of education like parks and recreation, physical education and vocational education. 

It is also accredited by the National Counsel for the Accreditation of Teachers and Education. According to Linda Blanton, the Dean of the College of Education being accredited is a determining reason for selecting FIU. 

"The best reason to choose FIU is that you [would] want to go to a school that has attained national accreditation, is a large college and is a research institution," said Blanton. 

The MDC program does offer students the opportunity to get an associate's degree after two years.  Then students in education can continue their education at the same college.  

Since the program is new, the class times are dispersed throughout the day. As the demand grows, classes will be offered at various times to accommodate students. 

 According to Poole, MDC will also give students the chance to participate in a lot of fieldwork and although MDC only offers three areas for the teaching degree thus far, those three areas are in high demand.

"The classes students will take will include a significant amount of field experience. Students will also earn their teaching certificate in one of the critical shortage areas [exceptional-student education, math and science], which will make them highly marketable," said Poole.

The FIU College of Education also requires students to take courses with field training. 

"All of the programs [in the College of Education] require students to acquire some classroom knowledge. Students have to observe in classroom settings and have some hands on experience," said Blanton.

There is a big difference between MDC tuition and FIU tuition. MDC is $56.20 per credit, while FIU costs $83.72 per credit for in-state undergrads. For out-of-state undergrads, MDC costs $197.50 per credit and FIU costs $399.23. 

Some FIU students would have considered MDC if they would have known the School of Education   would be offering a baccalaureate degree just because of the cost difference.

"I've never had a problem with going to MDC, but they weren't offering the education program when I applied to schools last year. It's a lot cheaper to go to MDC.  That's a big incentive for going to MDC instead of FIU," said sophomore and elementary education major, Geraldine Valleciullo,   

It is still too soon to tell whether the MDC School of Education will develop into large competition for FIU, but there are websites that can help students figure out which school is best for them.

Headline: Break from film festival leaves FIU short on culture
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
FIU administrators decided to part ways with their role as lead sponsor of the Miami International Film Festival, a decision that may reflect poorly on FIU's role in the arts community.

Citing the economic down turn and budget cuts that have totaled some $20 million over the past two years, the decision was made to cease underwriting the festival, in order to concentrate on "core competencies - teaching and research," according to a statement released by Mark B. Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of Academic Affairs.

Additionally, Rosenberg explained that administrators hoped the festival might one day lead to a film school, plans that have been indefinitely postponed. 

However, it seems unlikely that the discontinuation of FIU's role in the festival will lead to a windfall of funds; The reality is that the film festival never cost FIU much.

Over the past two years, the festival has lost some $800,000, according to an Aug. 29 Miami Herald article. That averages to just $400,000 a year, a sum of money barely adequate to hire a handful of adjunct professors at best.

FIU will, however, be losing its lead role in one of the most respected cultural events on the South Florida schedule, and instead, Miami-Dade College - formerly Miami-Dade Community College - may be arranging to take the reigns.

MDC already manages Miami Book Fair International, which is among the most respected book fairs in the nation, and has demonstrated considerably better skill at handling cultural events than FIU, which in a bold show of incompetency, hired (and later, fired) David Poland, a blatantly unqualified internet journalist, to run the film Festival in 2002.

The acquisition of the film festival would give MDC control over two of Miami's most respected cultural events. FIU would be left with minor players like the FIU Music Festival, the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, and Writers on the Bay.

With this move, FIU seems to be confirming that culture and the arts simply are not a priority, at least not in the way that the law school and football are priorities. It is disappointing that an institution located in such a cultural hot spot, an institution which touts its cultural diversity, would shy so forcefully from any involvement in that aspect of the community.

Headline: Five minutes is a world away: Life on-campus
Author: Felicidad Garcia / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
A year ago today, I was a freshman at FIU High School. My whole life I've lived five minutes away from the school that I later settled for as an institution for higher learning.

Why settle? 

I settled because FIU was generous to high school students with good grades, and quite frankly, I was pretty nervous about leaving home, (with no help whatsoever from mom, of course.) 

So there I was, with five classes a day, having at least two acquaintances from high school in each class. I even had the option of seeing the same faces in every single class by choosing to be in a Freshman Interest Group.

 Needless to say, I felt no change in my educational experience after high school, except that skipping class never caused anyone any distress (much less myself) and I had to spend a lot more time in long lines; buying books, getting a decal, paying tuition, acquiring a parking space, buying a syllabus, getting food, getting advised and anything having to do with financial aid. 

   My opinion of FIU was the same as it always had been, growing up. It was for losers who either couldn't get into better schools, or those who knew they'd have it easy for the next four years here being the arrogant geniuses they were all throughout their lives. 

I felt stupid here.

 Living at home was starting to be a pain because my family didn't understand what it was like to be in college and I wanted more freedom than the grade-school-Friday-night at-the-movies-hang-out asked for.

   My mom was wanting answers to questions regarding my future and my career that I could not even begin to answer.

 I knew I loved English and reading and that I did not want to be teacher. 

   "But what else can you with an English degree?!"

   If there was such a thing as familial claustrophobia, I know I was definitely experiencing symptoms. 

   Around the end of Spring semester was the breaking point. I had to get out of my house and actually start going to college. Well, it was too late to transfer to a "real" university for the Fall semester and I didn't have enough money to get an apartment, so I applied to live in the residence halls at Panther Hall. Very timidly, I also signed up to live in Honors Place, a community where most of the residents were in the Honors College, like me. 

    So here I am today. I have a messy room which I share with a freshman student from South Carolina, and the past two weeks living on campus have had a drastic effect on the way I view college life,  and FIU itself. 

   Over the summer it was strange, and I wondered if paying all that money to go live practically across the street from home was a wise decision after all.

  But the second I checked in and received my room and mailbox keys, I knew all my doubts could be thrown out the window and into the Housing Quad pool I luckily had a view of. 

Moving in was so fun. People were bustling all over the place, carrying luggage, asking questions, blushing in front of their doting parents, and helping you pick up the pillows you dropped, stumbling out of the elevator. 

Everywhere and everyone greeted with handshakes and countless names and origins you would never remember. Kids from Wisconsin, Mexico, Jamaica, New Jersey, Venezuela, Spain, Trinidad, Orlando, and Westchester. And that's just my floor. 

 It was mind boggling to think of all these people-smart people-who chose FIU; Didn't settle, but thought long and hard, read all their college pamphlets, spread out fan-like on their bedroom floors months ago, and chose FIU.

 Their energy and enthusiasm for this school, and desire to be involved within it is an extremely contagious disease, or rather, is the perfect antidote to my sensitive, claustrophobic state. 

 In living in hall where doors are always swung open, and students and new friends just walk in and out chatting, eating, playing and complaining, I've come to see FIU through their eyes.

 I see it for the pulsing, growing adolescent school it is, that for all it's flawed youth is full to the brim with the potential and the power to be an unforgettable four-year university experience. 

I find myself attending events on-campus now that I didn't even know existed as a commuter student. 

   Now, do I know now what I intend to do with my English degree? 

Have any of my ambiguous goals been cleared up for me? No. Absolutely not. 

Except for one. 

   I've always known that most of our lives pass us by while we sit around planning our greatness, and comfortingly, I now know that my initial planning period will be time well spent here at FIU...and in it.

Headline: Simple mistakes cost FIU a victory
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU receiver Cory McKinney saw the opportunity to put his team over the hump in the fourth quarter. Everyone held their collective breaths as last season's offensive star leaped towards the end zone after catching quarterback Jamie Burke's pass on a slant pattern.

McKinney was sent into an all-out tailspin by Indiana State defender Terrence Miles. The ball was jarred loose and recovered by Larry Thompson on the three-yard line.

Burke, who struggled early, completed seven-of-eight passes on the drive that originally began on the FIU 31-yard line. 

An Adam Moss field goal from 31 yards was preceded by a Golden Panther defensive stop that enabled FIU to set up its first score since Rashod Smith's 4-yard touchdown run with 5:55 left in the second quarter.

However, ISU running back Jake Shields, who rushed 29 times for 213 yards, took control of the game and the clock - scampering 63 yards downfield on a run off left tackle. FIU's defense held strong - stopping the Sycamores on fourth and goal from the one with a sack of redshirt freshman quarterback Jake Schiff. 

The Golden Panthers could not muster a comeback drive and the Sycamores came away victorious 13-10 at Memorial Stadium Saturday afternoon.

"We should have won this football game, there was no doubt about it. We had all kinds of opportunities, but we couldn't take advantage of them," head coach Don Strock said afterwards. "This was a team we knew was going to run the football, yet I thought our defense played excellent. We held them to 13 points. You're supposed to win the game when your defense holds somebody to 13 points."

Shields set a record for yards by an opponent against FIU. Of his 213 yards, 115 came on runs of 63 and 52 yards-the longest ever against FIU.

Eight penalties were called against the Golden Panthers, amassing 92 yards. Of the eight penalties, six were personal fouls and half of them resulted in ISU first downs.

"That football team isn't better than us,'' FIU linebacker Lance Preston told the Miami Herald after Saturday's game. ``We beat ourselves with mistakes and stupid penalties.''

The Sycamores took an early 7-0 lead in the first quarter on a 24-yard touchdown pass from Schiff to Matt Beste.

FIU knotted the score at 7-7 when Smith scooted into the end zone from 4 yards out with under six minutes to play in the first half. The drive was engineered by David Tabor, who replaced a struggling Burke for the last two series of the half. 

Tabor completed three-of-four passes for 34 yards.

ISU kicker Kyle Hooper added field goals of 32 and 25 in the game.



Extra Point



-Strock said afterward that Burke, who completed 18-of-31 passes for 131, will not be benched in lieu of Tabor. 

-Cornerback Greg Moss (bruised back) left the game early. 

-Randy Arnold sprained his right ankle and wide receiver Harold Leath sprained his right shoulder. Both were x-rayed Sunday. 

-Strock was extremely pleased with the success of the 3-4 defense.

Headline: Commentary: Despite loss, Panthers walk away victors
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Yes! They gave up more yards rushing Saturday afternoon than their season average from 2002 (216.4). However, if FIU's roster would consist mainly of juniors and seniors, or heck, just juniors - the outcome at Terre Haute's Memorial Stadium may have been different.

Surprised? You shouldn't be. Not if you followed this team and knew that the second year was going to be rockier than those mountains out west. Despite allowing Jake Shields to etch his name in FIU's brief history book for the longest runs from scrimmage against (52, 63), the Panthers showed fight, youth and some more fight in their 13-10 lost to Indiana State.

But remember, this is one of those games coach Don Strock spoke about. The kind that goes down as a victory for the other team, yet FIU still triumphantly exits with experience and the betterment of themselves. This was supposed to be one of those games that FIU makes tremendous strides - like Neil Armstrong on the moon - without actually, you know, winning.

The season, which is still young by all means with 11 games to play, should resemble a few small steps for the record and one GIANT leap for FIU football. We shall see.

Consider this: Had Shields not broken those two runs that were enough to amass the distance of a football field with an end zone and a half - FIU may be celebrating a victory against the Sycamores.

But was Saturday's contest a victory nonetheless? Who knows? The offense, the playmakers, the side of the football you thought had no problems besides the offensive line, failed to put points on the board.

Here is a defense that allowed what seemed like 704 rushing yards a game last season, allowing not nearly as many, and the Panthers still lose. Bottom line is they were able to hold ISU when they needed to, despite allowing Shields to pad his stats.

Probably the best thing about this FIU team, albeit a 0-1 FIU team, is that there is always fight left - the tank always seems to be slightly above that "E."

Just as they did last season when Maine was manhandling them throughout the contest, backup quarterback David Tabor led a touchdown drive in the game's waning moments. For pride. For the sake of having that bittersweet taste in their mouths a little less bitter, a little more sweet.

Even the offensive line gave them a chance, but these things happen with young teams. If a year from now, we are talking about these same problems - then by all means my friend, hit the panic button.

The offensive line gave up a measly two sacks to the Sycamores. That may be ghastly if you are someone else, but if you are FIU, you are blissful. Right now they are on pace to allow 24 sacks for the season - cutting last years total of 48 in half. Improvement?

I would say so. Okay, so FIU didn't put the ball in the end zone when it mattered and they couldn't take control of a game within their grasp, but they are still all sophomores and freshman. Cory McKinney went elbows over you know what in order to get into that end zone - coming up just short before the football was jarred loose.

And the defense picked up the slack after allowing a long run by Shields, giving their offense another chance. 

Please, accept this game as what it is: nothing more than a step on a ladder. More things are to come. There probably is a defeat in Portland, Maine next week at the hands of the 22nd ranked Black Bears, but keep those spirits high. Because if you thought Strock was going to come in here and contend for the playoffs, no offense, you are a buffoon.

There are going to be games in which the defense gives up 40 points and the offense will bail them out. There is no need to pin this one on the offense. They will eventually learn to put opponents away at the end of games - something they have failed to do as a young team since last season.

It takes time to build and only a second to crumble. Do you think Butch Davis, head coach for the Cleveland Browns and formerly UM, stepped into an immediate winner after the Hurricanes were faced with probation? Programs don't just sprout up from the ground like Jack's beanstalk. They take time to build. 

Here is a little food for thought. That same Davis- coached team that competed for the national championship in 2000, you know, the one with New York Jets wide receiver Santana Moss, the Colts' Reggie Wayne and the Ravens' Ed Reed to name a few - lost to East Carolina at one point in their rebuilding process. 

Tune in this Saturday to see what the score is when UM plays ECU.

The identity of the program is still being built; pretend it is fenced off by green tarps just like outside of the Graham Center's construction site. 

If by this time next year, FIU is not showing signs of improvement, then by all means, throw whatever you want at this infrastructure - cause it to crumble like the Berlin Wall if you will.

But until then, this is still a hard-hat area.

Headline: Men's soccer picks up two wins, Kremser gets 300th career victory
Author: Nasser Khalil and Harry Coleman/Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Sept. 5- FIU 4, SF 1



The second time men's head soccer coach Karl Kremser was doused with water, he was much happier than the first time.

With just a little over 22 minutes in the Golden Panthers home matchup against San Francisco on Sept. 5, the game was suspended due to rainfall.

FIU trailed the game at that point, 1-0.

But Kremser was all smiles the second time he got wet - this time not by the rain, but courtesy of a water cooler dumped all over him to celebrate his 300th career coaching victory.

FIU, however, got off to a rocky start. The Golden Panthers came out with a lot of intensity in the early going, but that translated into a lack of rhythm in their passes. They paid for their sloppiness in the 20th minute when a quick restart at midfield after a foul caught the FIU defense flatfooted as Dons' forward Luke Holmes was able to maneuver around Golden Panther defender Zachary Peoples and slip the ball underneath the arms of charging goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg for the early 1-0 lead.

Two and a half minutes later the game was stopped due to rain and lightning. 

The FIU team that appeared after the 30-minute rain delay was a crisper, more confident team than the one that fell behind 1-0.

"Coach told us he thought we could win the game, but we were worried about scoring mostly," said defender Mark Stephenson. "He told us to try and get an early goal, especially because we weren't sure if [the referees] would call the game [short]."

About a minute after the delay, FIU answered after a San Francisco defender poorly headed a Lucas Scudeler corner kick. The ball, instead of being cleared, was sent high across the box where Oscar Gil rose above the defense to send an arching header into the roof of the net to knot the game at 1-1.

The Golden Panthers scored again in the 30th minute when another Scudeler corner kick resulted in another head finish. Defensive midfielder Bobby Boswell, on a near post run, crushed the Scudeler corner past Dons' goalkeeper Mark Muleady to give FIU a 2-1 lead.

With about five minutes to play in the half, Kremser went to his bench. The move paid off quickly as substitutes had a hand in each of FIU's final three goals.

"We have some good depth, which is probably the most encouraging thing we take from this," Kremser said.

Two minutes after halftime, a sharp Hendrix Emanuel through-pass found Fernando Plentz, who was judged to have been brought down in the box. 

Substitute Jared Rose stepped up to firmly put the ball to the goalkeeper's left and gave FIU a 3-1 lead on a penalty kick.

Three minutes later, freshman Mario Franca scored FIU's most spectacular goal of the year when he side-stepped a defender outside the penalty area, picked out a corner, and proceeded to curl a right-footed shot past a diving Muleady, giving FIU a 4-1 advantage.

Although at this point the rain had long passed, FIU continued to pour it on. 

The Golden Panthers nearly scored a minute later when Plentz sprung David Hope, but his hard left-footed shot sailed wide and high.

Rosenberg calmed the lone moment of anxiousness in the second half when he saved a one-on-one from the Dons' Ben Stuart in the 59th minute.

In the 75th minute, FIU's Gustavo Vargas was sent off after San Francisco defender Alfred Bedrossian went down in a heap following an alleged tackle from behind. 

As a result of the red card, Kremser shuffled his lineup around and sent Gil to center-midfield. Gil's talent was on display in the 79th minute when he sent a sensational, long pass to a streaking Billy Boswell, but his shot past the goalkeeper was cleared off the line. A minute later, Gil sent another lovely pass to Franka, but his shot was saved.

In addition to the excellent play by the bench, Scudeler and Gil led the FIU offensive attack throughout the game. Stephenson and Handy led a very solid defense.

However, the story on this night was undoubtedly the play of the FIU bench.

"We have confidence in all our guys and we have a very good bench," said Stephenson.



Sept. 7- FIU 4, VCU 1



The Golden Panthers won the FIU Umbro Invitational, defeating the 10th ranked Virginia Commonwealth Rams 4-1 on Sept. 7. 

The victory gave FIU its third straight victory and first over a ranked opponent this season, as FIU improved to 3-1.

The first goal of the game came from speedster forward Carron Williams on a shot that zipped past Rams goalkeeper Saul Montero. Hendrix Emanuel assisted Williams.

The Golden Panthers went into halftime with a 2-0 lead after an unassisted goal from midfielder Billy Boswell.

Head coach Karl Kremser made a key substitution by bringing in Fernando Plentz off the bench who scored FIU's third goal on a cross from Mario Franca.

The FIU defense shut down the Rams' offense by allowing no shots in the first period. 

The Rams got on the board in the 59th minute when Giovanny Ricaldes knocked the ball past FIU goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg on a corner kick from Stephen Shirley. Rosenberg recorded two saves in the game.

In the 88th minute, Williams scored his second goal of the game on an assist from Oscar Gil.

Williams was Saturday's MVP but he was also named the tournament's Offensive MVP. 

Boswell earned Defensive MVP honors.

The next game for FIU is away on Wednesday, Sept. 13 against St. Louis University. 

Due to heavy rain on Saturday, the match was moved from the FIU Soccer Stadium to FIU Community Staduim, where the football team plays. 

According to Kremser, there was no way the game could take place at the soccer stadium so moving it was the only option for the game to take place.

Headline: Stress Levels at UP Skyrocket
Subheadline:  
Author: EdmundsL@FIU.edu
&nbsp;
As it took me 47 minutes to exit the Graham Center parking lot Tuesday (Sept 9) at 2 p.m., with the endless lines of cars funneling in from the GC lots, parking garages, and Tamiami entrance all crammed into one single Bermuda Triangle lane of a traffic circle, I had a lot of time on my hands to contemplate the fact that life at UP campus has gotten more and more unpleasant, ridiculous, and stressful, currently bordering on intolerable.

Between overcrowding everywhere you turn, and the messy, loud and inconvenient construction all over campus, it was gotten to be such a trial just to get to class and get around campus.
 
Parking has my students showing up stressed and sometimes near tears 10, 15 and even 20 minutes late for class. Not the slackers who were in Gracie's having a beer, but the hard-working, dedicated students who are the bread and butter of this campus. Their schedules are tight, between working and commuting and school - how much more silliness can they tolerate before they throw in the towel and go upstate or transfer to other, more user friendly facilities in Dade and Broward?

Every fall, there is some other huge obstacle put in our way or major convenience yanked away. Okay, so I am being petty and rigid, but little tiny inconveniences add up when FIU stacks one upon another, driving students, staff, and faculty just a little more crazy with each block of craziness. 

I miss the good old days - and 5 or 6 years ago things were quite lovely and calm and pleasant on campus - where I could find decent parking, buy my lunch on campus, get from one building to another, sit outside and enjoy the Miami weather without being attacked by these cursed ducks, and yes, even buy myself a Pepsi.

And, it is the little dictatorial moves that make a person crazy, such as the removal of the standard, all welcome cafeteria where one could buy whatever one pleased and sit comfortably in the cool air conditioning of the the Graham Center. As an adjunct with no office, I used to enjoy meeting with students in this setting. It was comfortable, affordable,  and convenient for all of us. The currently 'new and improved and redesigned' cafeteria offers food, at about $6 a plate, and one cannot enter the nice, cool comfort of the cafeteria to study, sit, converse, without, of course, ponying up that $6. There is no a la carte option, no "I just want to sit and study" option. I look lustfully upon the cafeteria space as I exit the Graham Center to hustle through the obstacle courses in place between GC and the library, as the cafeteria looks so blissfully quiet and calm, all those empty seats!

What happened to a free market economy, where the consumer is King? God forbid I forget to bring my lunch from home. I'm stuck in line for 40 minutes at Pollo Tropical or Subway, or left to eat scary food from the machines and eat or read or just relax among the intolerable din of the limited seating left a the Graham Center. Or maybe I'll go hunker down on a bench by the library and risk getting bit by a stinkin' duck. AGAIN.

Ah, forget it, I'll just buy a soda and have a PowerBar. Ooops, can't even buy a stupid Pepsi on campus anymore, unless I want to suffer through said Subway and Pollo Tropical lines, as some fascist decided to only sell one brand of soda on campus.

But, of course, the dining options aren't really a factor for me the first half of the semester, anyhow. I am an adjunct instructor. That means I will end up waiting until October 3, or maybe even October 17 to receive a paycheck. I'll be bringing my own peanut butter sandwiches and recycled water bottles from home for the duration. Every semester, it seems, we part-time instructors wait longer and longer for the 'paperwork' to catch up and the paychecks to kick in. Maybe I can make up a sandwich board and walk through the lines of traffic trying to enter and exit campus, announcing "Will Teach for Food."

But I digress. By the time I actually got to the dreaded traffic circle and could actually SEE the holy grail, 107th Ave., of course I was livid. Ready to take out a couple of parking cones, growling at the campus police officer trying to wave on/off traffic coming at him in five directions, realizing his job has gotten a whole lot worse, as well.

Upon my arrival at home, I turned on the television to find that violence had erupted in a parking lot at my beloved and embattled poor FIU.

Boy, was I shocked. Stunned
Stunned it doesn't happen more often, folks pushed to the total limit of their stress endurance.

Headline: The cosmic lights are flickering
Author: Bill Tammeus/ The Baltimore Sun
&nbsp;
At first I thought it was just my aging eyes. Things haven't appeared as bright in the world. 

Maybe you've noticed it, too. 

It's as if a cosmic rheostat has been nudged down ever so slightly, making things seem dimmer.

(When I say "things seem dimmer," I'm not referring just to politicians and the dolts in the cars in front of me who think turn signals are no more than decorative additions to the interior of their autos.)

But it turns out that there's a scientific explanation for what I've been experiencing and blaming on my eyesight.

 Scientists now report that the whole universe is slowly fading into darkness. 

Why? 

Well, stars that give off light are dying, and although new stars are forming, they're not doing so fast enough to replace all the ones buying the farm.

I'll get back to all that in a minute, but did you ever wonder why we have so many slang expressions for dying? 

Like kick the bucket, give up the ghost, go flatline, sprout wings, go home feet first, bite the dust, cash it in, check out, head for the last roundup, push up daisies, take a dirt nap and on and on?

I appoint you stiffs to go figure that out and report back by, say, Halloween, assuming all the research doesn't cause you to shuffle off the mortal coil.

OK, I'm back to stars. 

One reason I have deep faith in this new research is that one of the scientists who worked on it is named Heavens - Professor Alan Heavens of Edinburgh University's Institute for Astronomy.

Can you imagine any better name for an astronomer?

 Well, yes, maybe his first name should be Cosmo, not Alan, but his last name simply drips with astronomical credibility.

Great (who says?) Britain's Royal Astronomical Society sent out a press release about this universe-dimming news that quoted Heavens this way: 

"Our analysis confirms that the age of star formation is drawing to a close."

Clearly he is not speaking of the entertainment world, from which new stars burst forth almost hourly - and often fade just as quickly, demonstrating that the public's attention span for goofballs is limited, though that same public seems to be unendingly interested in the next batch of goofballs to come around.

"The number of new stars being formed in the huge sample of galaxies we studied," Heavens said, "has been in decline for around 6 billions years - roughly since the time our own sun came into being."

Most scientists now believe the universe is about 14 billion years old. 

If that's true, then the news that the universe has been getting dimmer is about 6 billion years old.

 Indeed, scientists have long known about the dimming, but the new research by Heavens and his partners offers a more complete picture of the phenomenon because they used the whole spectrum of light from about 40,000 galaxies in or near the Milky Way.

When astronomers talk about the spectrum of light, they mean all the colors in the rainbow - and maybe even beyond, for all I know. 

Colors like ultraviolet, the very shade I would like to paint the guest bathroom in our house, though my wife is insisting on something with more of a downer feel to it, like "Nasdaq Blue."

When scientists look at a galaxy, the shine they see is a combination of all the light from all the stars in it. 

Young, hot, massive stars (that would eliminate, among others, Calista Flockhart) emit mostly bluish light.

 These stars tend to live fast and die young (this would not eliminate, among many others, Janis Joplin).

Older, smaller stars tend to give off more reddish light, and Heavens and his colleagues have discovered that lots of galaxies look more reddish than bluish.

 Which makes me want to say "Wowish," but I'm showing restraint.

I really don't suppose I can blame this slow dimming of the universe for my own deteriorating eyesight. 

But I prefer that explanation over the aging process that requires me to seek brighter light for reading even normal size typewritten letters.

By the way, no letters were injured in the making of this column. 

Well, except for a few vowels, but they were asking for it.

Headline: Part One: Searching for Peace of mind in New York City
Author: John Colagrande, Jr.
&nbsp;
This is the first segment of a three-part series detailing the misadventures of a young writer's summer travels in New York.



Flying in. Oh my god. Nine hours to get from Ft. Lauderdale to JFK. 

Delay leaving Florida. Delay getting into Atlanta. Delay leaving Atlanta. Delay getting into JFK. Storms, storms, storms, and in the air nothing but turbulence. 

Arrived two in the morning - five hours late. Supposed to stay with a cousin. There was no one to greet me. Message on the cell from Cuz explained in so many words: you're on your own, kid. I had no back-up plan.

Jumped in a cab and said "Manhattan," not having the slightest idea where I would go or what I would do. Of course, there was a budget involved that would not allow me to check into any ol' hotel I wanted. 

It was official. I was in the midst of a Woody Allen panic attack. I called Fuad S. Hunter - my programmer - someone I knew would be awake and near a computer. 

"Whatchugot?" 

"Hunter, I need an exit. Check on a cheap place to stay," I said. "Hurry, Hunter! Cell phone's dying, cell phone's dying." 

He Googled something and came back to me. "Jazz-on-the-Avenue. One hundred sixth street and Central Park West. Twent-five-dollar-a-night hostel." 

"Thanks, Hunter," I hung up, turned to the driver, "106th and Central Park West."  

Next morning in the Spanish Harlem hostel: 

Cell phone charger plugged in. CHARGE...baseball anthem running in my head. Carpe diem. Today. Find a sublet. Start work on the novel. 

I was in New York on business, sort of. Wasn't getting paid. There were no meetings. And I didn't have an itinerary. My mission was to smell, touch, taste, watch, and listen to New York.

 I was writing a novel that was partly set in the city and to add a sense of realism that memory and imagination couldn't buy, I had to be there.

For starters, as soon as possible, I had to find a place to live. I had to get away from the hostel to find some peace of mind to write.

Stayed in the hostel for 10 days, a mixed dorm with six bunk beds.Twelve peeps in the room. The parlor came down with a bad case of the Foot and Ass Syndrome; It stunk - on average I'd drink three Ballantine double deuces with the puzzle on the cap and pop two and sometimes four Tylenol PM's to deal with sleep in the twelve-bedded room of Foot and Ass. So much for peace of mind. 

About the hostel: It is moot to remember anyone's name - you meet too many people. You are where you're from. And, unfortunately, stereotypes and generalizations seem to hold true. 

There was San Jose, the computer expert. And Dublin, the drunkard. Israel, the soldier and - of course- England, the floozy. 

And what about France, the arrogance and Seattle the dopehead? Then, there was Japan the warrior and little Sidney and Argentina, the trickster. Then there was me, a rootless daisy pulled from the weeds, born and raised in New York, schooled in Miami, lived in San Francisco, me, San Francisco the spinning top, me, so much me, the Viceroy of Miami. Where are you from, dude, you know? Like, where are you really from? Me, I'm New York the yo, yo, yo. 

Hostel life. 

A lonely dusk in Central Park. 

Distracted by the sound of a squirrel ripping, tearing, devouring, ravishing open a peanut shell - crrunch  - getting to the nut, peeling, unwrapping, nut skin - munch, munch, munch, I thought about the hostel. 

The hostel was New York. Every nationality in the world thrown under one roof forced to live together. All the stereotypes, generalizations, prejudices, racism, and misunderstandings, all under the same roof, getting along fine.

 The hostel mirrored New York. New York mirrored the world. 

Everywhere in the world diversity exists, and it's perfectly fine to be different and to even play around with the differences, but the world still moves in a circle, and the one thing we have in common is survival, that's where we respect one another. 

What better place to be for me than a hostel in New York City. 

There I was sitting in Central Park, next to Spanish Harlem, chillin'. 

I had found my peace of mind.



Stay tuned next week for part two and see how New York won't allow the young writer to find his peace of mind.

Headline: Virus infects FIU computers
Subheadline: Anti-virus, anti-spam measures 'in progress,' UTS says
Author: David Eugene Rodríguez
&nbsp;
 A new information technology security officer, a refreshed presence on the Web and free anti-virus software are among the novelties underlining the growing efforts of University Technology Services and the university community at large to assume a tougher stance against computer viruses and spam.

 The Sobig.F and Blaster worms, recently created havoc in computers nationwide. Amoung the infected were about 300 systems on FIU's computer network, all of which have had their operating systems and virus definitions updated already, said Robert Holley, assistant director of publications for UTS marketing and customer relations.

"What's unique about Sobig is that it spread itself so fast," Holley said. "It started out with a pool of e-mails and then replicated and harvested more e-mails."

 Many of FIU's computers are protected from viruses by McAfee Anti-Virus Software, which relies mainly on the prompt detection of viruses and in keeping virus definitions up-to-date. 

 In addition, UTS' McAfee Enterprise Virus Solution notifies UTS administrators of systems with outdated security files and automatically delivers updates, including virus definitions, and policies to the McAfee program on systems that have the tool's agent installed, said Yogi Misir, UTS associate director of marketing and customer relations.

 "There are almost 3,000 systems that are part of the UTS enterprise domain and have access to the enterprise virus solution via the agent," Misir said. "Outside of viruses, systems also need to have their operating systems updated, based on security patches released by Microsoft.

 "There are other technology organizations and support teams that choose to use a different anti-virus solution or strategy," Misir said. "There is currently no policy that requires all members of the university to use the UTS enterprise virus solution."

 As the university's central technology resource provider, UTS is starting to shift to a "more proactive, more formal, more organized" approach to virus issues, Holley said. 

Other challenges the department faces include: providing more services online, renewing administrative software systems and keeping up with advances in technology.

Cheryl Granto, a former director of information security for MindSpring, has recently joined the university's arsenal of information technology specialists. 

MindSpring, a former Internet service provider, merged with EarthLink in 2000 to create EarthLink, Inc.

As the university's first information technology security officer, 

Granto will spearhead the creation and enforcement of information technology security policy, disaster recovery and compliance management.

Granto will chair the Information Technology Security Council, the charter of which is yet unfinished. 

There will be a student seat in this council, Granto said. 

Granto will be involved in developing security awareness training, an extension of which is a security awareness campaign that she plans to carry out in the future.

"We'll work with the human resources department and the student government [during the campaign] to facilitate information to the faculty and the students," Granto said.

Currently some security measures students can take are as basic as keeping their workstations locked, not sharing their e-mail accounts with others and having passwords which are difficult to guess, Granto said.

 Special policy-making, administrative and response committees, composed of representatives from UTS and other technical divisions across the university, are working jointly as "discussion forums" to deal with virus, spam, and other security-related issues, Granto said.

 "These groups will facilitate awareness, increase communication and serve as a vehicle for soliciting feedback on technology initiatives and activities," Misir said

The currently established committees include the Information Technology Administrator's Committee, the Faculty Senate, and the Student Technology Advisory Committee.

"I.T.A. will provide technical support or manage technical support teams in various academic units and university departments," Misir said. "S.T.A.C. is student-led, comprising members from SGA, campus life, student residents at both campuses, the colleges and other student segments."

S.T.A.C. was established to give students  the opportunity to provide input into technology-related decision-making and policies directly affecting the student body, Misir said.

Misir recently met with the division of student affairs and several other departments to conduct a spam information session for the employees of the division, focusing on tactics "the industry, FIU, and various technology organizations at FIU" are taking to address and handle spam.

In the summer, UTS renewed its website (a branch of FIU's website), from which information can be accessed about the department's e-mail, hardware, Internet and other online services. 

A page about spam was set up to provide guidelines on how to reduce spam. Because the university is so diverse and one person's spam may be another person's treasure, 

UTS cannot filter e-mail with blanket rules, Holley said. 

Therefore, on the spam page users can find advice on how to filter their own e-mail. Virus alerts and information on the UTS newsletter are also found on the Web site.

Students, faculty and staff can download a copy of the software at no charge at the UTS Web site, or purchase it on a CD-ROM at a cost of $5.35 at Room GL150.

 Students and faculty and staff at departments lacking technical support can notify the UTS Support Center for assistance. Ther are located at Room GL-150.

They can be reached via telephone at 305-348-2284 (until 8 p.m. Monday-Friday). 

UTS can also be reached via e-mail at uts@fiu.edu, or by completing a "Service Request" form online.

Headline: Career Services adopts new user-based job search program
Author: Providence Okoye / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Career Services has replaced their MonsterTrak and InterviewTrak programs with what it intends to be a bigger and better job search program for FIU students, PantherLink, created by the users for the users.

"We wanted a system that was owned by the users and not a system owned by people who want to make a profit," said Olga C. Magnusen, senior director of Career Services. 

The new program has two levels: the basic services and the golden panther services. The basic services are open and available to all students free-of-charge; the golden panther services require a fee of $20. 

"Ultimately, students will be able to get more services," said Alysa Mangal, computer support analyst for Career Services.

PantherLink provides services such as enabling students to sign up for interviews with companies that will be visiting FIU. Students are also able to submit their resumes online. If students choose to sign up for a resume book, their resume will be submitted to the employer, but not before the resume passes the online resume critique review, if students prefer this option.

"I think it's great because you can correct your resume online, and I like the companies I'm seeing. Besides, most employers don't like much paper work, so it makes it easier for the students and the employers," said computer science graduate student Sylvia Miner.

As a member, a student is also entitled to attend career fairs and forums, and the use of job/internship postings and on-line resources. Self-help resource books and videos, invitations to special events, referrals for internships or career employment are just a few of the benefits of this new program. 

"A student can go online and put in a criterion on the kind of job they want. The student would receive an e-mail letting them know that there is a job matching their criterion on the system, which is great, and distinguishes PantherLink," said Irma Rivera, Career Services student assistant.

PantherLink is unlimited and is for everyone - freshmen and seniors, undergraduates and graduates, including international students. PantherLink provides international students with off-campus internships, which contribute toward academic credits. Above all, signing up with this new program provides students with a reliable recommendation to employers.FIU is just one of the 233 schools using this system. PantherLink is in partnership with the National Organization of Colleges and Employers (NACE).

"PantherLink is powered by NACElink, a board of both colleges and employers which knows the needs of the employer and colleges and how to suit their needs," said Career Services career consultant Ivette Duarte.

 NACElink is the result of an alliance between the National Organization of Colleges and Employers (NACE) and Direct Employers Association Inc, both of which are non-profit organizations. Other schools using the NACElink system include Yale University, University of Florida, Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, Rice University, University of Wisconsin, and a host of many others. 

"This is the best system currently available in the entire nation. It is user-friendly and allows students access 24-7. The market is soft, but it's amazing that instead of employers going to the job market or internet, they come to us to find potential candidates because they know the talents they are going to get is targeted," Magnusen said in relation to the availability and accessibility of PantherLink. Everyone who signs up with PantherLink before September 22 gets a 50 percent discount off of the one-time payment. 

"I'll encourage every student to sign up for it in order to enable them to explore all the numerous resources we have to offer," Mangal said.

The Career Services Job Fair will be held on Sept. 23. Anyone who attends must be signed up with Career Services, so the office encourages all to sign up now.

Subheadline: Anti-virus, anti-spam measures 'in progress,' UTS says
Author: David Eugene Rodríguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A new information technology security officer, a refreshed presence on the Web and free anti-virus software are among the novelties underlining the growing efforts of University Technology Services and the university community at large to assume a tougher stance against computer viruses and spam.

 The Sobig.F and Blaster worms, recently created havoc in computers nationwide. Amoung the infected were about 300 systems on FIU's computer network, all of which have had their operating systems and virus definitions updated already, said Robert Holley, assistant director of publications for UTS marketing and customer relations.

"What's unique about Sobig is that it spread itself so fast," Holley said. "It started out with a pool of e-mails and then replicated and harvested more e-mails."

 Many of FIU's computers are protected from viruses by McAfee Anti-Virus Software, which relies mainly on the prompt detection of viruses and in keeping virus definitions up-to-date. 

 In addition, UTS' McAfee Enterprise Virus Solution notifies UTS administrators of systems with outdated security files and automatically delivers updates, including virus definitions, and policies to the McAfee program on systems that have the tool's agent installed, said Yogi Misir, UTS associate director of marketing and customer relations.

 "There are almost 3,000 systems that are part of the UTS enterprise domain and have access to the enterprise virus solution via the agent," Misir said. "Outside of viruses, systems also need to have their operating systems updated, based on security patches released by Microsoft.

 "There are other technology organizations and support teams that choose to use a different anti-virus solution or strategy," Misir said. "There is currently no policy that requires all members of the university to use the UTS enterprise virus solution."

 As the university's central technology resource provider, UTS is starting to shift to a "more proactive, more formal, more organized" approach to virus issues, Holley said. 

Other challenges the department faces include: providing more services online, renewing administrative software systems and keeping up with advances in technology.

Cheryl Granto, a former director of information security for MindSpring, has recently joined the university's arsenal of information technology specialists. 

MindSpring, a former Internet service provider, merged with EarthLink in 2000 to create EarthLink, Inc.

As the university's first information technology security officer, 

Granto will spearhead the creation and enforcement of information technology security policy, disaster recovery and compliance management.

Granto will chair the Information Technology Security Council, the charter of which is yet unfinished. 

There will be a student seat in this council, Granto said. 

Granto will be involved in developing security awareness training, an extension of which is a security awareness campaign that she plans to carry out in the future.

"We'll work with the human resources department and the student government [during the campaign] to facilitate information to the faculty and the students," Granto said.

Currently some security measures students can take are as basic as keeping their workstations locked, not sharing their e-mail accounts with others and having passwords which are difficult to guess, Granto said.

 Special policy-making, administrative and response committees, composed of representatives from UTS and other technical divisions across the university, are working jointly as "discussion forums" to deal with virus, spam, and other security-related issues, Granto said.

 "These groups will facilitate awareness, increase communication and serve as a vehicle for soliciting feedback on technology initiatives and activities," Misir said

The currently established committees include the Information Technology Administrator's Committee, the Faculty Senate, and the Student Technology Advisory Committee.

"I.T.A. will provide technical support or manage technical support teams in various academic units and university departments," Misir said. "S.T.A.C. is student-led, comprising members from SGA, campus life, student residents at both campuses, the colleges and other student segments."

S.T.A.C. was established to give students  the opportunity to provide input into technology-related decision-making and policies directly affecting the student body, Misir said.

Misir recently met with the division of student affairs and several other departments to conduct a spam information session for the employees of the division, focusing on tactics "the industry, FIU, and various technology organizations at FIU" are taking to address and handle spam.

In the summer, UTS renewed its website (a branch of FIU's website), from which information can be accessed about the department's e-mail, hardware, Internet and other online services. 

A page about spam was set up to provide guidelines on how to reduce spam. Because the university is so diverse and one person's spam may be another person's treasure, 

UTS cannot filter e-mail with blanket rules, Holley said. 

Therefore, on the spam page users can find advice on how to filter their own e-mail. Virus alerts and information on the UTS newsletter are also found on the Web site.

Students, faculty and staff can download a copy of the software at no charge at the UTS Web site, or purchase it on a CD-ROM at a cost of $5.35 at Room GL150.

 Students and faculty and staff at departments lacking technical support can notify the UTS Support Center for assistance. Ther are located at Room GL-150.

They can be reached via telephone at 305-348-2284 (until 8 p.m. Monday-Friday). 

UTS can also be reached via e-mail at uts@fiu.edu, or by completing a "Service Request" form online.

Headline: Hispanics shine, break minority rank on TV
Author: Mike Duffy / Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
George Lopez has his eyes on a unique prize.

"I want go down in history as the first Chicano to make a show succeed. I don't need anything else. That's enough," says Lopez, the star of ABC's "George Lopez," a Mexican-American family sitcom rooted in the experiences of the comic's own life.

As it moves to 8 p.m. Fridays this fall, anchoring ABC's newly re-established "T.G.I.F." lineup of family-oriented comedies, "George Lopez" also marks a bit of important history. The series wasn't canceled after only a few episodes. It's going into a second full season, moving upward in the ratings, a modest though growing hit.

The last sitcom with a Latino star to connect in a big way?

You have to go back nearly 30 years. It was "Chico and the Man" - starring the late Freddie Prinze - which lit up the ratings for NBC when it premiered in 1974.

But as happy as Lopez is about his success, he also realizes that things are still seriously out of whack on network television. Adjust the color on your TV set all you want. You won't find very much brown.

The somewhat puzzling, frustrating truth: In our increasingly diverse culture, one in which a multilingual, multicultural wave has spread throughout American society, the programming on such major networks as ABC, CBS and NBC still mostly resembles a whiter shade of pale.

That's become especially aggravating to Latinos.

This year, U.S. Census figures confirmed that Hispanic-Americans have become America's largest minority, making up 13.5 percent of the U.S. population. African-Americans represent 12.7 percent of the population.

Not only are Latinos now the largest minority group, thanks to a continuing boom in legal and illegal immigration, their numbers are growing at four times the rate of that of the general population.

But you'd never know it by looking at television. The under-representation of Latinos is even more glaring on prime-time entertainment series.

Though 13.5 percent of the population, Latino characters totaled only 3 percent of the prime-time population. That's according to "Prime Time in Black in White," a University of California at Los Angeles study of television diversity released earlier this summer.

The UCLA survey - a content analysis of 234 episodes of 85 sitcoms and dramas on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, UPN and WB in the fall of 2002 - echoed the results of past studies. It also found that white characters received 81 percent of screen time, followed by blacks with 15 percent. That left Latinos, Asian-Americans and nearly invisible Native Americans largely overlooked or left on the fringes of the network landscape.

George Lopez didn't need a diversity survey to confirm what he's long known.

"That's like saying fried food is bad for you. The UCLA study that says Latinos are underrepresented? I don't know what they spent on that, but you could have given me $10 and I would have told you Latinos are underrepresented. We've always been underrepresented."

And Lopez isn't alone in his frustration.

"It's the same old story. It keeps coming up and coming up," says Latina actress Rachel Ticotin. "And hopefully, it will change. But it will change slowly."

One sign of that gradual, evolutionary change?

This fall, Fox is introducing a trio of new series that feature Hispanic performers, themes and stories.

Ticotin is part of that Latino boomlet, playing a Mexican-American judge on "Skin" (9 p.m. Oct. 20), a Fox drama series with a cross-cultural Romeo and Juliet story line. Ticotin's handsome Mexican-Irish son (D.J. Catrona) falls in love with a pretty Anglo suburban princess.

The other two Fox shows, which have an even heavier Latino focus, include:

"Luis" (8:30 p.m. Sept. 19), starring noted character actor Luis Guzman ("Traffic") as the irascible, outspoken proprietor of a Spanish Harlem donut shop that serves a multi-ethnic clientele.

"The Ortegas" (8:30 p.m. Nov. 2), a middle-class Mexican-American family comedy, featuring well-known Chicano comic and actor Cheech Marin in its all-Latino ensemble.

Marin, for one, thinks that there's no stopping the Hispanic population boom from eventually leaving its mark on television.

"It's inevitable. The Latino wave in this country is not going away," says Marin, who previously enjoyed a good prime-time run on the CBS crime drama "Nash Bridges," portraying Don Johnson's detective partner.

"We've always been here. Now it's just a process of recognition of Latinos that we're not an outside culture," says Marin. "A recognition that we're part of the mainstream, we're part of the fabric of this country. The sooner that all the networks recognize that, the better off we'll all be."

Under pressure from the NAACP, the National Hispanic Media Coalition and other groups to increase the presence of minorities on screen and behind the scenes, each of the major networks has appointed executives to oversee diversity efforts and pledged to make improvements.

But often, the progress is a matter of small steps. Sometimes forward, sometimes back.

Though Fox is adding its three Latino-themed series, NBC failed to renew the stylish Latino crime drama "Kingpin." And the Mexican-American family comedy "Greetings from Tucson" was canceled last spring by WB after only one season.

"I've learned to temper my impatience with an understanding that this is going to happen whether they like it or not," Alex Nogales, chairman of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, says of the networks. "But they're not going to do it because they love Mexicans or Puerto Ricans, but because it makes sense economically."

Green has always been the color that drives Hollywood. Absolutely, says Gail Berman, president of Fox Entertainment.

"Our viewer is a young adult consumer. And they're multicultural, much more multicultural than an older audience," says Berman, explaining that "The Ortegas" and "Luis" wouldn't be on the Fox schedule if the network didn't believe they could shake the money tree.

The network thinks Hispanic shows "are good for our consumer base," says Berman. "But we have to be commercially successful as well."

There's an extra challenge for American networks in reaching Hispanic viewers: the language barrier.

A large segment of the newer immigrant population still speaks Spanish, sometimes exclusively. Those viewers often prefer the programming on Spanish-language cable channels such as Telemundo and Univision.

"That's our target audience,"says Jim McNamara, president of Telemundo, which is owned by NBC. That segment of the primarily Spanish-speaking audience, he says, is growing dramatically.

The Nielsen ratings bear this out. Nearly every week, Spanish-language programs, mostly soap opera telenovelas, dominate the Top 20 shows among Hispanic viewers.

That left ABC's "George Lopez" at No. 37 in the most recent ratings, tied with "Friends," in Hispanic households.

The vast majority of "George Lopez" viewers are non-Hispanic. The ABC sitcom averaged 1 million Hispanic viewers and ranked No. 76 in Hispanic TV households during the regular season. But it averaged 10.3 million viewers overall and placed No. 53 among all viewers in the regular season.

Fox's Berman points out that any of the network's minority-focused shows must appeal to a wide and diverse viewership if it is to succeed. She cites the crossover popularity of "Bernie Mac" as one key example, a black sitcom that draws both white and black viewers.

While the major broadcast networks lag, cable and public television sometimes provide a more progressive vision.

Nickelodeon, the popular children's channel, has offered such Latino-flavored shows as "The Brothers Garcia" and "Dora the Explorer."

Showtime, which will present its annual Latino Filmmakers Showcase for young artists Sept. 15, aired the Mexican-American drama "Resurrection Boulevard" for several seasons.

And "American Family," an ambitious Mexican-American family drama starring Edward James Olmos, returns for another season on PBS this fall.

Headline: Soviet performance lacks vitality, bores scenesters
Author: Nicole Ochoa/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The word on the dance floor  last week was that on Friday Soviet was going to tear up Revolver.  

Soviet, like many other bands that are popping up lately, is a side-project by Carlos Dengler, the amazingly talented DJ of Interpol. 

Scenesters spoke words of adoration as they took breaks from their dancing, flyers were sprawled all over cars in the paring lot; this seemed as though it was going to be the greatest thing to hit the Soho Lounge in a while. 

Friday night finally rolled around. 

I walked in ready for a good show to review and left later on that evening, $10 poorer and with a complete loss of hope for the independent music scene.  

Unfortunately, Dengler never got the memo that side-projects rarely surpass the real thing.  

The band hit the stage, and I automatically knew it was going to be a disaster.  

They looked like the Kens and Barbies of indie-rock.  I seriously wonder sometimes if there is some factory in an obscure city that just shoots out the typical hipster and puts an instrument in their hand. 

I also wonder, if this place really does exist, why the heck they don't shoot them up with some Prozac before shipping them off into carbon copy America.  

Not one smile adorned their faces, they barely even said hello, and they sure as hell did not thank the crowd for being there.

Disappointment had already set in, but I figured that they just might compensate for their lack of originality and cordiality with some good music.  

After all that is what the kids were there for right?

The first song started and I could have sworn I had heard it before, which was odd considering that I had never heard Soviet until that evening.  

Then it hit me, I have heard this song before, a million times. It is every single song that is out today.  

The same drawn out '80s sound that blares through the speakers at the Soho Lounge every night.   

Now, you would think that even though they were, to an extent, playing someone else's song that they would actually enjoy doing so. 

But no, they seemed more interested in themselves, their look and exactly how cool they could look while they were up there.  

They lacked the cohesive feel that every good band holds, it looked like a bunch of strangers just picked up some instruments and jumped on a stage together.

The audience soon picked up on the vibe and found themselves in their own conversations by the bar, and those who stuck around seemed to have already made one too many trips to the bar.  

When the set was over, they got their usual claps but something tells me that we, the audience, should have received the acclaim for sitting around and listening to garbage for what seemed like an eternity.  

Whatever happened to music being an art, not a fashion?  Whatever happened to the connection that the audience felt with the band?  

Most importantly, whatever happened to originality?

I guess it was all flushed down the toilet by a bunch of pretentious kids who wanted to create an empire based on who happens to be "more scene" than who. 

Who cares?  It's all trivial when you are ruining what others go for, what I go for and what I am writing to you for:  the music.

Headline: Coulter spews anti-liberal propaganda
Author: Katherine Powell / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Ann Coulture is arguably the most vehement conservative of our time.  

Her new book, "Treason: Liberal Treachery From the Cold War to the War On Terrorism" is written with a fiery passion that even if you don't agree with, and chances are you won't, you at least have to admire.  

In fact, the book ought to come with a warning: DON'T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.  

Her book resembles an Eminem record in that although it says something about the state of affairs today, the name-calling and highly opinionated style she employs is too in-your-face to be effective. 

Not only can it be infuriating for some to read, but also incredibly insulting.  

She supports McCarthyism and Nixon, claims that Liberals were protecting soviet spies, that "Vietnam is the left's favorite war because America lost" and that any one who is opposed to war with Iraq should be tried for treason.  

The first sentence pretty much sets the tone for the rest of her book: "Liberals have a preternatural gift for striking a position on the side of treason.  You could be talking about Scrabble and they would instantly leap to the anti-American position."  

The book continues with sarcastic remarks against anything and everything, which proves to be rather ironic considering that elsewhere she writes, "Without the highbrow sneer of sarcastic quote marks, Walter LeFeber would be unable to communicate."  

Her exhaustive research is decidedly one-sided; she nit-picks for things that support her arguments and then does exactly what she accuses liberals of doing: twisting facts and blowing minor comments out of proportion.  

The book comes across as strikingly similar to the fanatical ranting of anti-government websites developed by paranoid potheads that claim "they" are all out to get you.  

For example, she states "Liberals expect everyone to forget not only what they said during the Cold War, but the fact that there was a Cold War, and that they were rooting for the other side." 

Some of the other establishments she apparently has some sort of major beef with are the New York Times, even though they provided one of the blurbs on the back, and the Nobel Peace Prize. 

She attacks the Norwegian Nobel Institute for awarding the Peace Prize to Jimmy Carter (whom she attacks earlier as well, saying "Carter is so often maligned for his stupidity, it tends to be forgotten that he is also self-righteous, vengeful, sneaky, and back-stabbing") and others, while forgetting Ronald Reagan.  

Anyone accepting what she writes seriously will get a picture of an America filled with establishment-hating, anti-government usurpers who want nothing more than to give away all of our secrets to the Communists and give money to support terrorists, and somehow the New York Times is in on it and supporting the destruction of the free world as we know it by suppressing the truth about liberal communists.  

She insists that liberals are anti-American, but gives no explanation as to why or what their motivation is.  

While some people might find this sort of  propaganda entertaining, it is my opinion that reading "Treason" is mostly a waste of time and money.

"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star": Funny, but lacking depth

  

Alanis Morissette, this is ironic: "Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star" opposes the idea of kids acting, but one of the best things about it is its two kid actors.

Like David Spade's underrated "Joe Dirt," "Dickie" is great in concept, so-so in execution. 

Dickie (Spade) had a series when he was a tyke, but now he's consigned to weekly poker games with equally washed-up actors who probably came straight to the set from "Star Dates" or rehab (Barry Williams, Danny Bonaduce, that Screech guy). 

Dreaming of a comeback, Dickie decides the only way to get the acting chops he needs is to relive the normal childhood he never had, moving in with an average family so he can learn about allowance, chores and sharing a room with those two likable child actors.

There are elements here of "Billy Madison," "Tootsie" and "The Man Who Came to Dinner," but "Dickie Roberts" feels fresh because it has a basis in truth: Going Hollywood does mess up kids. 

"Dickie" reinforces that idea in several ways, from an 8-year-old's slutty-beyond-its-years cheerleading audition to the finale, a "We Are the World"-style song brayed by a chorus of Where Are They Nows.

	Spade is a surprise. It figures he'd be funny in an idiotic scene where he's cruising down the highway, banging his head to Christopher Cross as if Cross were Audioslave. 

But Spade is also surprisingly effective when he's required to project the pain of someone who grew up physically but not emotionally.

The film ends in exactly the right place, with Dickie figuring out what's important, but it's a choppy journey. The flaw is that Spade is more skilled as a performer than as a writer (he co-wrote the movie). "Dickie" doesn't go deep enough, doesn't recognize that it would be funnier if it were more true. It had never occurred to me, for instance, that someone who is routinely given Humvees and gift baskets might not have a clue how rewarding it is to actually give a gift. That's the sort of detail "Dickie Roberts" could use more of.

Say It Like You Mean It: More prepackaged pop-punk "music" 



I'll say it how I mean it. Wow. I was left speechless after listening to this album. 

Right when I begin to think that Drive-Thru Records could not slap me in the face any harder, this album comes out. 

Normally, I choose to stay away from bands like The Starting Line and anything remotely associated with the Hot Topic mass-production of pop-punk kids, or "punk-rockers" as they like to be called. 

Putting aside my biases toward the pop-punk genre, I took one for the team. Oh and how it hurt. 

If you have soft spot for this band, if it has ever entered your CD player, or if you own any Drive-Thru merchandise, then I suggest you stop reading. 

Here's the deal, keeping in mind the fact that this band re-released their most popular song, "Leaving," from their EP and first release With Hopes of Starting Over, one does not expect much of a transitional growth in the band's  first full-length album, Say It Like You Mean It. 

Basic lack of originality suites it well. 

This album included the typical agglomeration of most (if not all ) pop-punk bands. 

Instrumentally, it goes a little something like this: the same 4-4 time signature with frighteningly similar guitar solos in almost identical locations, song after song. 

Lyrically this is all I have to say: ridiculing yourself through music is apparently not an issue for The Starting Line. Write what MTV wants to hear and give the fans what they want to see. 

It's as if every pop-punk band convened together in the same room, picked three basic topics to write about (girls, broken hearts and puppy love), sat down and wrote a single song for each topic, then proceeded to pull out a thesaurus and rewrite the identical song with a few various changes in vocabulary words. 

The song and beat are the same throughout with minute detail changes and  different song titles. 

If you do not mind some superficial similarities to Mest, Good Charlotte and New Found Glory, you might find this album to be a great addition to an embarrassing CD collection which you will deny to have ever owned a few years from now.

Headline: Culkin lets his darker side show
Author: Joe Neumaier/ New York Daily News
&nbsp;
Here's Macaulay Culkin as you've never seen him before. 

The former child star of "Home Alone" fame - which became one of the biggest hits in Hollywood history when he was only 10 years old - is back in his first movie in nearly a decade.

Now 23, Culkin plays a gay club kid who kills a drug dealer in the edgy drama "Party Monster." 

"I don't want to do what I did before," he tells Barbara Walters during an interview to air Friday night on ABC's "20/20."

"They, like, built an industry out of me. ... It was just this really odd dynamic that I think made me uncomfortable for a lot of my young life."

Asked if he has a dark side now that he's grown up, he replies: "I guess you can say that."

It's been a long, strange trip since his "Home Alone" days.

He hasn't made a film since 1994 (while his brother Kieran has become a much more acclaimed actor); he's had to endure a bitter battle with his father over money; and he's stirred controversy with everything from his relationship with Michael Jackson to a fatal fire in the Culkin family apartment.

"Party Monster" co-director Randy Barbato thinks Culkin has lived more in his 23 years than others do in a lifetime. 

"I think he's lived many lifetimes," he says. "He had an inherent understanding of everything about celebrity, and that's what this film's all about."

"I wouldn't trade any of my experiences for anything in the world," Culkin tells Walters. "I'm very happy with who I am and where I've ended up, and I wouldn't change one thing. Because if you change one thing in the past, everything else is different."

Born in New York in 1980, Culkin appeared in small roles on stage and in TV commercials at age 4. His father, Christopher (Kit) Culkin, was a frustrated actor who pushed his children into performing.

John Hughes put Culkin in 1989's "Uncle Buck," then wrote "Home Alone" for the 9-year-old. It made more than $285 million after opening in 1990, becoming one of the top 10 moneymakers to that point.

Culkin's mother, Patricia Bentrup, and his father insisted that in return for doing "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," he get the part of an evil child in "The Good Son."

"He thought it would be fun to play a bad kid after being America's sweetheart," says "Good Son" director Joseph Ruben.

Then things got weird.

In 1991, Culkin met Michael Jackson - and they began spending time together at Jackson's Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif.

"We had very similar experiences in childhood," Culkin has said of his friendship with Jackson. "We're both going to be 8 years old forever in some places, because we never had a chance to be 8 when we actually were."

Then his parents, who were never married, officially separated, and as his films became less successful ("Richie Rich," "The Pagemaster"), Culkin got in the middle of his parents' custody battle, which involved his $17 million trust fund. Culkin remains estranged from his father, who conceded custody.

Culkin continued to live in his mother's apartment on West 60th Street, where he'd grown up, until his marriage to actress Rachel Miner in 1997. They were both 17 years old and had dated less than a year.

In December 1998, a fire started in the Culkin family apartment. Four people died, and 20 others were injured. The Culkins moved out shortly afterward.

Culkin then went into a period of what he describes to friends as agoraphobia - a fear of going outside - that kept him in his apartment for almost two years. In early 2000, he and Miner separated; they later divorced.

In "Party Monster," Culkin plays Manhattan club kid Michael Alig, who was part of the `80s drugs-and-dance culture before he was convicted of murder.

Later this year, he'll be in two more film dramas: "Saved," with Mandy Moore, and "Jerusalem," with Martin Sheen.

And his personal life is back on track: He's dating Mila Kunis of "That `70s Show." 

The jury is still out on his professional life.

"The question is, will (audiences) let Macaulay come back?" says "Party Monster" co-director Fenton Bailey. "It doesn't matter how good he is in the film. The question is, will (people) allow him to reinvent himself after a time in the wilderness?"

Headline: FIU Theater prepares to amaze and entertain with medley of shows
Author: Isis Iglesias/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"What good is sitting alone in your room?  Come hear the music play ... life is a cabaret old chum, so come to the theatre to see a play." 

FIU Theatre is offering an impressive array of plays this season.  

The selections range from a modern drama to a sexy musical and, in between, Shakespearean comedy.  

The opening play is a whimsical comedy that is sure to please.  There is enough variety in this season's fare to tickle the fancy of a wide range of theater- lovers.   

Here is a preview of the drama.   

 

Picasso at the Lapin Agile



Picasso paired up with many a character in his long life, from his collaborations with Braque to his old rivalry with Matisse recently explored in an art exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  

Years after his death, he still continues to fascinate the world, most recently as muse to Steve Martin.  

"Steve who?" you may ask. None other than the film actor, turned painter, turned playwright.  

"Picasso at the Lapin Agile," written in 1996, is Martin's first play.   

Since then, it has been performed numerous times and has recently been made into a film starring Kevin Kline, Juliette Binoche and Ryan Philip.  

FIU's version will be directed by Rafael Oliveira.  

A light-hearted and philosophical romp through Montmartre, it is about the imaginary meeting of Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein at the Lapin Agile, one of Picasso's favorite haunts.  

Picasso painted "Au Lapin Agile" in 1905, immortalizing the little cabaret that was the meeting place and hang out of many artists.  

Artists were allowed to pay for their meals with paintings, which Picasso did with one of his harlequins.  

Einstein and Picasso, both in their '20s, have a lively discourse about society, science and art amidst a motley of the bar's regulars.  

On the stage: Oct. 9 - 11 and 16 - 19, 2003



As You Like It



William Shakespeare's romantic comedy "As You Like It," set in the Forest of Arden, is sure to be an enriching experience for the actors as well as the audience. 

Directed by Wayne E. Robinson Jr., it is a play about love, as it manifests itself in a series of different guises.  The young lovers, Orlando and Rosalind, must overcome various hilarious obstacles before they can wed.  

The play is rife with feuding brothers, disguises and instructions on how to love. 

Rosalind is a modern heroine who strives for the passion of love while still keeping a cool head.  

She is one of Shakespeare's most delightful characters and the centerpiece of this sexy romp through the magical woods and magical words of the master bard.

Cabaret



Musicals are hot again and few are hotter than "Cabaret," probably the most performed musical since "Cats."  

It is based on the play by John Van Druten, with stories by Christopher Isherwood and music by John Kander.  For those who are not familiar with the act, it takes place in Berlin at the Kit Kat Club where the audience is wooed by the maniacal emcee. 

It follows the romance of Ryan Cutlip, an American writer, and Sally Bowles a loose nightclub singer. 

This is the first musical performed at FIU in over three years, says Theatre Manager Abel Cornejo, because they are so expensive.  So be sure not to miss it.  

Musical junkies will just have to settle for another viewing of "Chicago" for now, since the play won't be performed till the spring.  

Just don't be tempted to watch the screen version starring Liza Minelli as Sally Bowles, since her depiction of the nightclub nymph is a hard act for any diva to top.  

A word of caution to those who know the songs by heart: Please resist the urge to sing along.  Nothing is more annoying than that at a performance, except maybe for the ringing of a cell phone.  

On the Stage: March 4 - 7 and 11 - 14, 2004



Before It Hits Home



The closing play of the theatre season is a serious drama about the end of a life.  

"Before It Hits Home," written by Cheryl West, is about an African-American bisexual man in his early '30s suffering from AIDS.  

Wendal Bailey is a character that inhabits two disparate worlds which he must eventually confront and reconcile.  

He is living a double life, and when he has to face his disease, it all comes crumbling down around him. 

Wendal has to face his lovers, his family and himself before he can find the love and support that he needs.  

The author of the play was formerly a social worker who chose to write about a topic that few want to mention.  

Directed by Leslie Ann Timlick, the staging of this play is a strong, brave choice that will surely test the mettle of FIU's fledging actors.

On the stage: April 8 - 11 and 15 - 18, 2003

Headline: Dazzlers to show off talents in first ever Variety Show
Author: Steve Perhla and Taylor Hearn/Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
The FIU dance team will hold its first ever Golden Dazzler Variety Show on Friday, Sept. 12 at 6:30 p.m. at the Golden Panther Arena.

The show will consist of singing, different types of dancing and other performances by the Dazzlers.

"It's the first year that we're doing it and it's a variety show so the girls are going to get to show off whatever style of dance that they like - slow, hip-hop, jazz, tap, all kinds of dancing, said junior co-captain Monica Sotolongo.

Added head coach Brenda Popritkin: "This is the first time ever that we are doing this kind of show. We hope to make it a yearly event and a new FIU tradition."

The Dazzlers, who usually perform choreographed dance routines during football and basketball games, will get the freedom to dance however they want in the Variety Show.

"All the girls can showcase whatever there strength is, and it gives us a chance to showcase our talents besides what we do at the games," said Sotolongo.

In addition to friends and family, the Dazzlers are hoping more FIU students will support the team and attend the event.

It's important to get people from [FIU] so we can get recognized, and then when we have auditions in the fall, [students] can see what we have, and want to join to make us bigger," said sophomore Talia Rickards.

Added Sotolongo: "We want other Dazzler hopefuls to come, and maybe see the talent we have and hopefully want to be a part of it."

And the Variety Show is a perfect opportunity for the Dazzlers to showcase their talent. 

This event will feature the Dazzlers at the main attraction and give them the primary spotlight - something they rarely have.

"We're the main feature. Normally we're just like side entertainment, halftime entertainment, but this time it's our show," said Sotolongo.

For the 22 Dazzlers who make up the squad, the performance will be their first show of the new semester, and for some of them, their first performance as a Dazzler. The team had close to 30 members, but some quit because of the dedication the team requires.

"Some people quit because they don't know what the team's about and they find that they can't handle it because it's very time consuming. Some people don't realize that and they end up dropping," Sotolongo said.

As a result, the team is looking to recruit new dancers, but is only looking for advanced dancers at this time.

However, for the Dazzlers who have committed themselves to the team, they are ready to display the results of their hard work.

Asked why people should attend this event, Rickards said, "We have so much talent to show, it's not even funny. The creativity level is really amazing so there are a lot of reasons people should come out and watch us."

The event is also being designed as an attempt to earn funds for the team. If enough money is earned, the team will be able to attend national competitions for the second year in a row. 

"The main purpose of the show is [to serve] as a fundraiser for us to go to competition this year, for us to be able to do all the things that we want," Sotolongo said. 

"We only get a certain amount of budget and we have a really big team this year, and we want to accomplish a lot, so one of the ways of doing that is through fundraising."

The Dazzlers have also raised money through other means like hosting birthday parties and providing dance classes for younger dancers, know as the Junior Dazzlers.

"We do catalogs, sponsorships, bake sales, a lot of things. We're supported by FIU athletics, but if we want to receive extra [money], it's up to us to come up with the extra funding," said Dazzler Dominique Voltaire.

As far as even making this event possible, the dancers give most of the credit to their coach, Popritkin, who was a Golden Dazzler herself from 1992-95 as well as a Miami Dolphins cheerleader from 1997-2000. Popritkin is responsible for helping bring the Dazzlers back into the FIU Athletic Department.

"[Brenda] is bringing back the tradition, because the Dazzlers kind of faded out for a while. They weren't even associated with athletics, but she came back and revived the program and that's how we've been able to go to competition again, and now we're having a show again," said Sotolongo.

Popritkin thinks the girls deserve a good turnout by FIU supporters.

"When [people] go see the show, they will be impressed by the talent and stamina that it takes to put on these kinds of dances," Popritkin said. 

"The girls have been rehearsing for the last month to get ready for the show, and we also have a Dazzler (Voltaire) that sings beautifully and she will perform as well."

Said Voltaire: "I'll be the only one singing, so it really is a true variety show." 

Tickets for the event can be purchased in the Golden Panther Arena ticket office from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. for $15. 

Tickets can also be bought at the door on the day of the event for $20. 

There will also be surprises and giveaways throughout the show.

With each ticket purchase, attendees will receive a free ticket to the football team's home opener against Bethune-Cookman on Sept. 20.
