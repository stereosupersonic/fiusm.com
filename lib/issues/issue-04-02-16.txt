Funds being wasted at FIU


To the Editor:


I'm writing in reaction to the past few articles showing FIU's money problems. 

There are so many things I don't understand.

I work in the controller's office as a student assistant and I see what goes on some of the time. 

For instance, it seems that more people are constantly traveling. I don't understand why there needs to be so much travel. They travel to show they need it.

Why can't there be a "mission critical" policy in place again? Why was it lifted? Because we are a little more monetarily secure? Having a "mission critical" policy would make things run more smoothly in light of the cut to the education budget.

The travel funds could be reallocated elsewhere, perhaps to financial aid students like me who do their taxes honestly. Dishonesty of this caliber, 
I also don't understand.

This tuition raise, which is sure to affect especially non-residents like 
both my Jamaican cousins where it's a struggle even now to attend, might even be cushioned if wiser spending habits existed.

I don't understand why our president received a raise. What is the purpose of it? Was he given a raise because of a personal financial need, or because he has extravagent needs? 

Why does life have to be extravagant, with huge houses and competition for most things. If it really is just a simple case of that, simplicity would certainly make budgets more balanced, especially when you can sign yourself as your own supervisor on a university budget transfer. I'd certainly like to know why he got a raise...again!

I tire of what seems to be blind signing of things. You want something done, sure! I'll sign for it. It doesn't matter that my department's account is $50,000 in the red, but it will be made up somehow. 

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem likely that anything will be resolved anytime soon because of the multi-million dollar cut, which ultimately extends to certain Washingtonian paraniod decisions made regarding possible wars and anti-terrorism stances.

I just don't understand.

A message to Senator Kerry


To the Editor:
   

If President Bush runs on his record, especially on the War on Terror and national security, he will win in a landslide. 

All Kerry has to do is try and explain why he was against the Gulf War but for Operation Iraqi Freedom. In Operation Desert Storm we pushed the Iraqis out of Kuwait, a soverign nation. 

But in Operation Iraqi Freedom Iraq was not being beligerant to its surrounding nations. Where is Kerry's logic and judgment? 

Did Kerry base his support for Operation Iraqi Freedom on the fact that it was largely supported by the American people and he knew he was running for president? Does Kerry have any principles at all? Doesn't seem that way. He has flip-flopped on every major issue. He voted against the kind of weapons we need to defend the homeland. He voted against the weapons that won us the Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom. 

He voted to weaken our intelligence, so I have no confidence that he will improve our failed intelligence agencies. 

If Bush runs on his record it will show a principled conservative. Some things he supported failed, but he didn't change his mind on his principles because it didn't work like Kerry is doing with Operation Iraqi Freedom.

He may be riding high in the saddle within his own party, but when it comes to November 2004 he will lose as badly as Micheal   Dukakis did when he faced the elder President Bush - unless the entire country goes mad. How is Kerry going to run against a largely successful president? His tax cuts got us out of the Clinton-Gore recession. 

Even if President Bush shirked his duties as a national guardsman, he is a successful commander-in-chief who made decisive actions based on principles rather than political expediency. 

Kerry, you are not running against a national guardsman. You, member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, are Senator Kerry, running on an extreme left-wing Senate record against President/Commander-in-Chief Bush who ran a successful campaign against Saddam and Al-Qaeda. Just wanted to remind you as a public service.

Headline: Men's basketball misses winning shot at buzzer
Author: Harry Coleman/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After losing its past seven games by double digits, FIU took a giant step forward against Middle Tennessee State, only to come up short 54-53 Feb. 7 at the Golden Panther Arena.

With 2.2 seconds to go in the game, Mike Dean hit one of two free throws to give the Blue Raiders the lead. 

After the play, head coach Donnie Marsh took a timeout and called a play for Carlos Morban, who drove down the court but missed a 25-foot jumper from the left perimeter at the buzzer.

The first half was sloppy for the Golden Panthers. The team committed 11 turnovers, but kept the game close due to MTSU's erratic shooting, which made 12 of 33 field goal attempts. FIU shot well from the free-throw line in the first half, hitting seven of eight. FIU was down at the half 31-28.

As the second half opened, FIU heated up after Warren Gale scored two points, picked up a steal and a blocked shot in the first three minutes. 

The Golden Panthers lived up to Marsh's tough defensive mentality by holding the Blue Raiders scoreless until the 15:45 mark. Middle Tennessee did not score its first field goal until Keith Connor hit a shot with 13:36 left.

"We faced an athletic team and we defended them hard and well," Marsh said. "We played close and to win but we fell one point short tonight."

Down 42-36, the Golden Panthers went on a six-point run and tied the score as Marcus Robinson deflected the ball, which landed in Raphael daSilva's hands, who then hit one of two shots from the line after being fouled.

Gunn hit one of two free throws with 3:52 left to give the Blue Raiders a 51-45 lead. Junior Marcus Robinson answered the call for FIU, hitting consecutive three pointers, tying the game at 51.

"In the second half, I said forget it, I'm [gonna] play and that's what I did. I felt good with those threes and I took them. When I play with that mindset, I play better," Robinson said.

With 22 seconds left to play, daSilva hit a pair of free throws to tie the score 53. As Middle Tennessee played for the final shot, Dean drove toward the basket but got fouled and hit the free throw that sealed the game for the Blue Raiders. Marsh was pleased with his team's effort despite the loss.

"I'm proud of these kids because we all know the situation we're in right now and they could have easily folded and said, 'Hey, this team is pretty good', but we didn't. These kids fought and played hard," Marsh said.

Michael Cuffe led all scorers with 16 points to help Middle Tennessee snap a three-game losing streak. The loss was FIU's 10th straight and 15th in its past 16 games. Robinson and daSilva led FIU with 10 points apiece.

With 2.2 seconds left, there was no question Marsh was going to design the play for Morban.

"It's a tough shot for him but he's our kid, and if we have a chance to make the play, he's the one that's going to make it," Marsh said.

Gabriel Lazo again received the start at point guard over Robinson but finished the game with no assists.

"It's a tough loss because we work, but we are playing more together as a team after the lineup changes, and we will get better," Lazo said. "Starting is a decision coach made and I will play hard because I know I can play at this level."

Despite the loss, Robinson and daSilva felt the team took a step forward with their play.

"Its tough to lose but we took a big step forward. We came out and played with heart, [pride] and together. Its tough to lose when you play that well and lose by one. There's a difference between when you lose by one and when you lose by 30. When you lose by one, it hurts," Robinson said.

Added daSilva: "You know I'd rather lose by one every game and play the way we did than lose by 20 and play with no heart."

Before the game, Marsh let his players know that quitting would not be an option.

"I said to the kids at the beginning, that the easiest thing they could do is give up and lay down, but one of the toughest things they could do is to hang in there and battle," Marsh said. 

"Everybody contributed tonight and they took a big step forward. Obviously there's no consolation in losing because we came in trying to get the win, but before you can get it, you have to believe you can, but today we just ran out of time. That's the bottom line."

Marsh was limited to only nine players to use in the game. Harry Lum was out due to a sore thumb and Taurance Johnson was dismissed from the team for a violation of team rules. Johnson's dismissal came after being suspended twice last week and almost the entire season last year.

"It was probably a long time coming. It's a situation where we felt we had gone far enough with it. He's a young man. We wish him the best, but he has to understand the same level of commitment that those guys gave tonight, and has to understand accepting responsibility for his own actions, and that it's not always somebody else's fault," Marsh said.

Headline: Women's basketball's three-game win streak snapped by two losses
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
Feb. 7 - MTSU 73, FIU 47

The Lady Golden Panthers suffered their worst loss of the season, falling 73-47 to Middle Tennessee State Feb. 7 in Murfreesboro, Tenn. 

FIU's road struggles in conference play continued as the team fell to 1-4 on the road in the Sun Belt. FIU fell to 11-11 overall with the loss.

The Golden Panthers were unable to contain freshman Krystle Horton, who scored a game-high 25 points for the Blue Raiders.

FIU shot 33 percent from the field and allowed the Lady Raiders to shoot 52 percent. The Lady Panthers were also out-rebounded 35-26.

Trailing 22-18 with 3:56 to go in the first half, FIU allowed MTSU to go on an eight point run and entered the half down 32-21.

FIU senior Ivelina Vrancheva (11 points, five rebounds) hit a three-pointer to start the second half as the Lady Panthers opened the half on a six point run to cut the lead to 32-28. But MTSU responded with nine unanswered points and opened up a 15-point lead. The Lady Raiders held a double-digit lead the rest of the way, giving FIU its worst loss since a 77-51 loss to FSU in the WNIT last season.

Vrancheva and sophomore Allison Bustamante combined to shoot only six for 21 from the field and junior Milena Tomova, the team's leading scorer this season, added only one point.

Bustamante finished with 13 points to lead FIU and extended her streak to 22 straight games with a three pointer made.

FIU fell to 5-4 in the Sun Belt East and a game behind second-place MTSU (6-3).

Feb. 9 - WKU 73, FIU 69 (OT)

Western Kentucky's Leslie Logsdon led the Lady Toppers to a 73-69 victory over FIU on Feb. 9 in Bowling Green, Ky.

The Lady Golden Panthers out-rebounded the Hilltoppers 41-40, but committed 21 turnovers in the contest.

Back-to-back layups by Tomova gave FIU its largest lead of the first half at 26-19 with less than four minutes to play. 

But WKU went on a six-point run and tied the game at 29. FIU entered the break up 33-29. WKU went on an 11-point run in the second half and held FIU scoreless for nearly six minutes, taking the lead 42-37. 

Trailing 51-45, FIU scored six straight points to tie the game at 51 apiece. Down 57-56, Bustamante hit a three pointer to give FIU a 59-57 lead. 

WKU trailed 59-58 with 15 seconds remaining, but freshman Carla Bartee hit one of two free throws to send the game into overtime. But OT was ruled by Logsdon, who scored nine of her 25 points in the period. WKU was five of five from the field in overtime and handed FIU its second-straight loss after winning three in a row previously. Tomova led FIU with 27 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high seven blocks. Bustamante and Vrancheva each chipped in with 13 points each. 

FIU fell to 5-5 in the Sun Belt and 11-12 overall and fell a game behind third place WKU (11-11, 5-3) in the Sun Belt's Eastern Division.

Headline: Bryan Pullin: Ready to Shine
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Bryan Pullin didn't waste any time making an impression at FIU.

With a successful freshman campaign in which he hit .322 with 23 RBI, it was Pullin's consistent offensive production that gave him a reserved role in FIU's 2003 starting lineup. 

This year, however, coaches are still trying to figure out where Pullin will play to be able to give him an added role for 2004.

"I have been practicing all over, but I have fun in any position I play," Pullin said. 

Last season, Pullin occasionally played first base, but served as the team's primary designated hitter toward the end of the season. This year, Pullin says he doesn't care where he plays - just as long as he gets a chance to help his team.

"It didn't even matter to me where I played," he said. "I am so content with just being out there."

Last month, head coach Danny Price discussed the possibility of Pullin playing the outfield in addition to  his role as designated hitter. 

Mike Lopez has been the primary first baseman so far this season and the designated hitter position will probably be shared by numerous other players.

"Bryan could probably play left field and that would put another bat in our lineup," Price said. He can really swing the bat and he's a really tough out."

A "tough out" might be an understatement for Pullin. Consider the fact that he hit .353 against Sun Belt Conference teams and posted a .429 on-base percentage. Factor in that he hit .508 in his senior year at American Heritage (Sunrise, FL) and stole 18 bases there and you can see why FIU recruited him so heavily out of high school.

Not that there was really ever any competition. Pullin, born in Puerto Rico but raised in Sunrise, made it clear he never had any plans to leave South Florida out of high school and says FIU was his first choice. 

Now, after a successful year under his belt, he is hopeful he can improve into one of the Golden Panthers' team leaders this season.  

"I had an exceptional year last season, but I am really looking forward to our team this year," Pullin said. 

And Pullin is already off to a great start in 2004, batting .353 with a team-leading two homeruns through five games, being used primarily in left field.

"This year we have a lot of new guys who definitely compliment the team."

Last season, Pullin finished fifth on the team in hits (48) and was named a member of "Louisville Slugger's" Freshman All-American team for his efforts. 

"It was such an honor to be named on the All-American Team," Pullin said. The honor was a tribute to Pullin's work ethic and life-long dedication to baseball - a sport he has played since he was five.

However, despite the awards and recognition, Pullin's freshman season was not easy. During midseason last year, due to intense stress that dated back to his youth, Pullin aggravated his arm and missed 19 games.  

"I have always had a problem with my arm since I was very little," Pullin said.

Still very talented, as well as determined, Pullin focused on how he could benefit his team, despite his injured arm. After a number of games on the bench, he was back in the batter's box as FIU's primary designated hitter and excelled offensively for the team. Now, looking around the corner into this season, Pullin understands his role and is confident his experience will improve his game in year two, disregarding the commonly used "sophomore jinx" reference. 

"People who think of that are just making excuses," Pullin said, in a strong, convincing tone. 

Pullin will have to prove the sophomore slump theory wrong if FIU plans to get back to postseason play. 

Pullin, Luis Rivera, Dennis Diaz and Lopez are the only everyday players with at least one year of playing experience and will have to lead a relatively young team, featuring a number of brand new players.

"A lot of people think I had this awesome year last year, but there are many things I still want to do better, " Pullin said. "I want to go beyond my numbers."

After baseball, Pullin hopes to play professional ball, but plans to graduate college and work with athletes through medical training. 

"I cannot imagine myself away from sports," Pullin said immediately when asked of his future goals.

However, if Pullin's dream of playing professional baseball never materializes, it will not be such a bad thing, considering the fact he has already fulfilled more than he ever expected.

"I used to watch all the college teams when I was little," Pullin said. "I still can't believe I am playing on one now."

Too many generalizations about diversity


To the Editor:


  I have a comment relating to your "Valuing Diversity Project" article in the Jan. 26 The Beacon.  Throughout this article you praise FIU on its diverse population while at the same time looking down on the fact that although we are a diverse campus, members of each ethnicity tend to stick close to others like them.  

You then have a quote stating, "There is no interaction among ethnic groups here.  A lack of communication is what leads the way to generalization."  

Having lived on campus for three years, being from "up North"; I have seen the exact opposite of what this person is claiming.  When I arrived here with my other friend from Maryland, I was definitely shocked by the diversity of people on campus having, in my own ignorance, no idea what a multicultural place FIU or Miami is.  

And what did I do when I first got here?  Run immediately to the few white people I could find? Of course not. I relished in it.  
I have many friends at FIU and exactly two of them are of the same ethnicity.  The friends that I have at FIU, and will hold on to, are from Costa Rica, Ecuador, Zimbabwe, Uruguay, Trinidad, Jamaica, are Cuban and Columbian.   

While I do agree the quote has some merit considering what GC looks like, maybe you all shouldn't generalize and should instead look at the bigger picture.   

While your article speaks of lack of communication leading to generalizations, I would just like to say how ignorant I find FIU right around American Heritage Week, that celebrates America by playing country music, having Uncle Sam on stilts, and a bunch of hay everywhere.  

If that isn't ignorance I don't know what is.  Having traveled through a vast majority of the United States, including Alaska, most of the Midwest and the entire East Coast, I would just like to say that country music and hay are pretty much the last two things I think of when I think of America.

Response to Diaz article


To the Editor:


I recently read Andy Diaz's article concerning President Bush's remarks on same sex marriage. While my conservative views have me backing the president on this issue, my reason for rebuttal is not based on that premise. Simply put, Diaz does not know the facts. Beginning with the title, "Bush stance on gay marriage unconstitutional."  As was made crystal clear, Bush wishes to amend the constitution to ban gay marriages. I can assure  Diaz that it is 100 percent constitutional to amend the constitution. President Bush's stance while unpopular with many liberals, is the most constitutional stance he could have taken.

Another assertion Diaz made  fallible was his statement that "Even if there were only two Americans of the same sex wanting to marry, it would still be an infringement upon their rights to prohibit it..." 
Diaz mentioned the full faith clause of Article IV of the US Constitution. 

This clause has little bearing on this situation. The clause is important in this debate is the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which says, "States shall grant equal protection of the laws to all citizens..." 

Many people opposed to Bush's stance have incorrectly taken stock in the 14th Amendment as plainly making it unconstitutional for a state not to grant a same-sex marriage. This also is false.

Marriage, as it was intended by the founding fathers, is a legal protection granted to a couple in exchange for their expected contribution to the nation's stability and economy. Married couples have the advantage of  tax breaks, economic boons, and other priveledges granted to them. 

These priveledges come for the expected return of procreation that naturally comes from a marriage, which has direct bearing on the stability and prosperity of our country. 

Furthermore, banning a same-sex marriage, does not mean the denial of their rights. Treating same-sex marriages as "civil unions" absent of any religious nature is a common practice among many states in this country. This gives homosexuals comparable protection under the law, while keeping the sanctity of marriage in our country.


As a nation built upon the individual right to hold your own ideals, nothing is greater then when issues such as these become  disputed. 
Holding a view is a noble thing, but holding a view and basing that view on incorrect information is not noble, it is irresponsible.

Headline: Gracie's Grill offers new products, needs advertising
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Gracie's Grill has recently made some additions to its menu in the hopes that it will be more successful than its now defunct drink menu. The failure of the drinks menu underscores a history of inadequate and inaccurate advertising.  

Four months ago, students were led to believe that Gracie's had begun selling cocktail drinks like pia coladas, Long Island iced teas, and rum and Cokes. 

The ads, which surrounded the Gracie's menu, made no mention that these cocktail drinks were not cocktail drinks at all - at least, not in the conventional sense. In reality, the Premium Blend cocktails Gracie's was selling were made with a soft liquor similar to Mike's Hard Lemonade. 

Selling it doesn't require more than a beer and wine license, which proves its potency (or lack thereof.)

Even the Premium Blend web site states the customer "...will not get the alcohol bite they are accustomed to..." with Premium Blend as a hard liquor substitute. 

If anyone knows how a cocktail should taste, it's a college student. Soft liquor simply doesn't cut it.

Between the inadequate advertising, and the fact that what Gracie's was advertising wasn't what it was serving, sales lagged and the items were dropped.

Now, Gracie's is selling all kinds of new food products. There is a "99 cents" menu, chopped chicken and rice dishes, salads, and the introduction of themed nights. There's a Caribbean night, a Salsa night, and a Ladies night, with Disc Jockeys providing theme-relevant music, still the word isn't out. 

What's missing? Promotion.

If our interviews with students showed us anything, it's that most students were unaware of all the changes taking place at Gracie's. 

Some of the changes are welcome, but if Gracie's expects these changes to pay-off, it needs a sound, accurate and adequate promotional campaign.

It needs to find ways to let students know what's going on, and most of all, Gracie's needs students to trust it.	 

Advertising needs to be done. 

Part of the reason the drinks menu never took off was because there simply wasn't enough promotion. And what little there was, was inaccurate. Students didn't know there were themed nights either. 

Maybe Gracie's Grill can reach the commuter student population by actually advertising events and specials outside of the restaurant.

Headline: High officials deny, cover up existence of deadly chemical
Author: Ted Randall/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Fratricide: It is the clinical term used when a soldier or "friendly" is inadvertently killed by a fellow soldier. The media and the Pentagon like to call it "friendly fire." It is a nice euphemism that deflects the horrible reality of the entire event.  

Friendly fire is anything but.  

There is nothing friendly for either the soldier engaging or being engaged by state-of- the-art weaponry.  

Imagine the crew of a US Abrams M1-A1 tank engaging what it thinks is an Iraqi T-72 tank. The tank commander gives the command to fire. 

The gunner sends the depleted uranium tipped SABOT round down range. There is no calling the round back as it travels at more than 100 meters per second, the commander realizing too late that he has fired on a comrade. 

The SABOT round's armor piercing tip slices through the "enemy" tank like butter exploding into a super heated aerosol thousands of degrees in temperature, vaporizing the crew inside.  

Death is instantaneous.  

There is no handy euphemism for the type of fratricide occurring today. The Pentagon is silently killing its own troops, and the death is anything but quick.    

There  is a silent, slow killing form of friendly fire that the Pentagon denies, the Department of Veteran's Affairs refuses to treat, and the mainstream media has little stomach for.  

It is fratricide by Depleted Uranium.  It resembles the same socio-political hot potato that Agent Orange was 20 years ago. For years, during the Vietnam War, the US military sprayed tens of millions of tons of anti-defoliants across Vietnam. US combat troops walked through acres of defoliated jungle were even caught beneath the spray itself. 

Officials told them the pesticides, dubbed Agent Orange because of their orange-like residue, were harmless. 

The Department of Defense denied tens of thousands of Agent Orange-related VA claims as service-connected.  After years of medical and legal battles with the DOD and the VA, veterans suffering from the debilitating cancers and other health problems associated with Agent 

Orange were finally compensated by the VA for their service-connected maladies.    

In Desert Storm, American and allied combatants handled, expended, and lived in the dust and fall out of depleted uranium weapons on a daily basis. 

The Pentagon denied that the painful, debilitating illnesses thousands of soldiers began experiencing had anything to do with their exposure to depleted uranium.  In fact, what they are suffering from was radiation contamination from exposure to lethal doses of depleted uranium.  

After the Gulf War, thousands of American soldiers became ill with what has now been termed Gulf War Syndrome. It is the fall out of what is nothing short of nuclear war. Depleted uranium is used by the US military in tomahawk cruise missiles, SABOT anti-tank rounds and 20 mm A-10 cannon rounds.  

It is a toxic component of nuclear waste relished for its ability to enhance the penetrating capabilities of certain weapons. 

These weapons irradiate troops that are near them.  Once they have exploded, the depleted uranium vaporizes into a fine ceramic radioactive dust containing plutonium, uranium, and americium. These substances enter the food chain.  They contaminate the earth, the water, the air.  

This is a weapon that keeps on killing. Depleted uranium has a life expectancy of 4.5 billion years. 

Once ingested into the human body, it attacks the lymphatic system where it can destroy the entire immune system, the liver, the brains, and the lungs. President Bush and Vice President Cheney have already dropped 75 tons of depleted uranium on Iraq. In Desert Storm, Bush Sr. expended 320 tons.  

After Desert Storm, more than 300,000 veterans developed maladies associated with Gulf War Syndrome. 

Studies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have shown that 62 percent of sick veterans have uranium isotopes in their brain, lungs, urine and even semen.  A disproportionate amount of birth defects among new borns of Gulf War veterans have been recorded. In post-Desert Storm Iraq, the pictures of hundreds of grotesquely deformed babies born since 1991 document the 700 to 1000 percent increase in birth defects, as well as cancer, among Iraqis.      

The Pentagon continues to deny any medical fall out from depleted uranium. It lies about the potential consequences of depleted  uranium exposure and does not inform the troops of any such hazard.  

It argues that a depleted uranium battlefield is no problem to troops, that depleted uranium-related complaints have no "medical basis," and that there is no evidence supporting the link between Gulf War syndrome and depleted uranium.  

However, the Pentagon's very own Army Environmental Policy Institute contradicts official claims stating that "If depleted uranium enters the body; it has the potential to generate significant medical consequences." 

The Pentagon's denial is pragmatic, fiscal really. 

By denying depleted uranium's significant health hazards, it defers the staggering costs of  treatment and VA compensation.  

Depleted uranium contaminated veterans are the walking dead.  The number of depleted uranium sickened troops from operation Iraqi Freedom could be overwhelming. 

Most young warriors are unaware of the depleted uranium threat as they walk among ammunition stockpiles or breathe the acrid dust of the contaminated desert. 

Many troops wear chunks of depleted uranium shrapnel around their necks as amulets. According to experts, "A depleted uranium round emits more radiation in five hours than is allowed in an entire year under civilian exposure standards."  

The dust storms televised during Iraqi Freedom were most certainly depleted uranium contaminated and those troops exposed to it will most certainly have significant health issues in the near future. 

They will no doubt face the same battle for medical treatment and VA compensation as their Vietnam brothers in arms. 

If this administration truly cared about its warriors and veterans, it would admit openly that depleted uranium is a killer and offer training, proper protection, and the medical treatment they deserve.  

Friendly fire seems to come in many forms. The result is the same. American soldiers die.

Headline: Jackson's Superbowl flash distasteful
Author: Rachel York/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Let's talk about breasts!

Glad I caught your attention. You're wondering whose breasts I'm referring to? Well, Janet Jackson's, of course. 
If you weren't as fortunate as the so many millions of others who caught the sexy surprise during the halftime show at the Superbowl Feb. 1, congratulations.

Too bad for Janet and her partner in crime Justin Timberlake, many people didn't find her spectacle all that wonderful. The general consensus was that the whole idea was just distasteful. 

We've grown very used to expecting almost anything on television these days, but I think it's safe to say that when the Superbowl becomes "adult TV" something is very wrong. 

Let's recap. The very exciting game between the New England Patriots and the North Carolina Panthers reached halftime.  

During a much longer break than usual, we were entertained by the likes of Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson. Programs warned that the show would contain something shocking. Who knew that something would mean Timberlake ripping off a piece of Janet's clothing exposing her breast? 

Those watching at home saw a mere moment of the exposure, as the camera men skillfully focused elsewhere. The performers insisted that it was not planned, that it was merely a malfunction of Janet's costume. 

Right. 

Later, of course, the truth is told. The whole thing was deliberate. 
We'd like to thank  Jackson for her heartfelt apology, "I'm just sorry it went so far." I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, where exactly did you think it would go? After all, it's a safe bet that families, children included, would be attending or gathered around the TV for the Superbowl. 

It's really a sad, disgraceful mess. So many families have had to cut TV time more and more, some down to mere minutes a week, due to the overtly sexual nature of everything from commercials to comedy.

Call me crazy, but I am of the opinion that the Superbowl is one of those things anyone should be able to watch without being sexually bombarded. 

One could argue that MTV's track record for decency and sexual discreteness hasn't been the greatest, and with them hosting the halftime show, we should have known that we may have been offended. 

Our mistake.  

I may be in left field here, but maybe we should keep a list or something of all the performers that are likely to start ripping off their clothes during their performances.  

That way we know if they're performing at the Superbowl, or some other supposed family-friendly event, we'll know to change channels or blindfold the kids, and quite possibly ourselves, for those of us who really aren't interested in what Janet's breasts look like.

Headline: Rathskeller halts soft liquor sales
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
Gracie's Grill has halted liquor sales citing lackluster interest and minor controversy.

For the past four months, Gracie's added a few cocktails to their drink menu, which already includes various brands of beer. The cocktails, advertised as traditional favorites such as rum and Coke, Long Island iced tea, and Pia Colada, were made with a wine-based liquor called Premium Blend.

According to the Premium Blend web site, "Premium Blend is a unique combination of fermented and distilled alcohol .... It is classified as a vinous (wine) product making it legal to sell and server with only a beer and wine license." It has a lower alcohol content than regular liquor, though the website recommends doubling the amount used when mixing drinks.

Instead of increasing the Rathskeller's profits, soft-liquor sales created controversy, which led Gracie's management to drop the items from the menu, at least temporarily.

According to Jose Fuentes, Gracie's Grill general manager, on Feb. 6 a few football players started what he called a "pre-fight" inside the restaurant, and he was obligated to intervene. The fight was allegedly over a girl. 

Some questions arose about the sobriety of the students involved, though Fuentes does not think the fight was alcohol-related because the students' beer tab was not more than $70.

However, the incident led to questions about the establishment's liquor license and its alcohol sales.

Gracie's Grill holds a state-issued a license to sell beer and wine. The wine-based, soft liquor it was using in the cocktails is covered by this license.

"Apparently someone along the line have thought that we are selling 'hard' liquor," said Fuentes.

Fuentes said that Gracie's management felt uncomfortable selling liquor after the fight, and he decided that it was best to stop selling those new drinks for now, though there is a possibilty that Gracie's will sell them again in the future.

Though there are no plans to have a full bar available for students at the establishment.

"We want to have certain measure of control on this particular issue," said Fuentes, referring to students drinking on-campus. 

He added that most people do not believe that Gracie's is worried about the students' safety, but he personally does care and would not like to do anything to harm the students. 

Fuentes said that any student who drink more than normal would be stopped for the convenience of others. He said he personally worries about students' safety; therefore, excessive consumption of alcohol on their premises would not be welcomed.

The Beacon attempted to contact Patricia Telles-Irvin, vice-president of Student Affairs, for comment on the issue of Gracie's Grill selling liquor on campus, but she did not return our calls.

Headline: Valentine's day cards include black SpongeBob
Author: By Jim Schaefer/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
American Greetings Corp. calls it a regrettable printing error. Somehow, boxes of SpongeBob SquarePants Valentine's Day cards are popping up in Detroit Wal-Mart stores but the popular cartoon character found inside isn't his traditional yellow color.

	He's black. And with his trademark big teeth and wide eyes, this SpongeBob seems similar to offensive images of African-Americans portrayed in minstrel shows decades ago.

	American Greetings officials said Thursday they were surprised and puzzled when the Detroit Free Press made them aware of a complaint about the product.

	"We absolutely fell out of our chairs when we saw it," said Carol Miller, director of business development for the Cleveland-based company. 

"We're obviously going to be talking to Wal-Mart as well as Nickelodeon ... to offer our sincere apologies for this product making it to market."

	Miller said the cards, which were printed and packaged in China, are mistakes, but she and other officials said they were trying to determine how that happened.

	David Blinderman, director of global product development for the company, said the printing facility is one of the company's most reliable.

	"Culturally, the guys on press in China wouldn't have the faintest idea of who a SpongeBob was or who a black SpongeBob was," Blinderman said.

	Jemeka Garcia of Flint Township, Mich., was skeptical of a mistake, in part because the cards appear to be well made. Garcia and her husband, Scott, complained to the Detroit Free Press earlier this week after their 6-year-old daughter discovered the different SpongeBob. The family purchased the cards at a Wal-Mart near their home so the girl could hand them out to her first-grade classmates.

	"I want to know why the person did it," Jemeka Garcia said Thursday. "That's kind of a horrible prank. And what if some kid gets it" as a valentine?

	A Wal-Mart official said customers who want refunds can have them, but there were no plans to take the boxes off shelves. "It was a very popular item and there aren't very many left out there," said corporate spokeswoman Danette Thompson. She said the company had received no other complaints.

	The cards branded as "Nickelodeon 34 Foil Valentines" and selling for $2.74 are exclusive to Wal-Mart. Officials said they were widely distributed across the country, but they would not say how many had been produced. 

The Free Press checked a Wal-Mart in Roseville, Mich., and found the cards. There are 68 Wal-Mart stores in the state.

	SpongeBob stars on the Nickelodeon cable channel. The show chronicles the cluelessly optimistic meanderings of a bright-eyed sponge, who lives in a pineapple in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom.

	Jemeka Garcia said she's already gone out and replaced the offensive SpongeBobs for her daughter.

	"I went and bought her some Scooby-Doos."

Headline: Sexologist gives keys to happy relationship
Author:  Emily Jensen/ Page Designer
&nbsp;
Relationships are not simple, making one successful takes work. 

There are many factors that play a role in relationship building, including sex. 

As if building connections with people wasn't complicated enough, sex brings a whole other set of things to think about. 

Having sex is a big responsibility. 

The Health and Wellness Center, and the Counseling and Psychological Services center invited Marilyn Volker , a sexologist, to speak to students about sex, and sexuality. 

Volker made two presentations in the Graham Center Ballrooms on Feb. 10 as a part of Sexual Responsibility Week. 

Volker also spoke at the Biscayne Bay Campus on Feb. 12. Valentine themed safe sex packages were also distributed in GC containing condoms, candies, and information about Planned Parenthood locations in Miami-Dade to encourage sexual responsibilty.  

Volker, a member of The American Board of Sexology, and The American Academy of Clinical Sexologists, runs a private practice in Miami. Volker also teaches an introduction to sexuality course at FIU in the summer. 

During the lively presentation, Volker provided scientific reasoning about different aspects of sex. 

The presentation pointed out the differences in gender roles, society's role in sex, the importance of communication, and options to keep you protected.

"We see the world for what we are, not for what it is," said Volker referring to people thoughts on sex.

 She does not believe that everyone sees the big picture. She attempted to reveal misconceptions about how people view sex, and sexuality.

Volker said something that happens between sex is not the legs, but also in your heart and brain. She recommended "four gear shifts" to get a lover, especially female, to respond well. 

Volker said people in relationships should make an effort in each of these areas: talk, touch, time, and trust.

Volker distributed many different kinds of contraceptives to sexually active audience members such as, flavored condoms, non-latex condoms, and several different kinds of spermicide. Volker addressed many questions about protecting oneself  from both pregnancy and disease. 

Volker used word play and sign language to keep students interested answering questions of any kind, no matter how graphic.

 "Each time I start the presentation in the same place," said Volker, who has participated in FIU's Sexual Responsibility Week for three years.. "but every time it takes a new direction,"

Headline: Gracies' adds diversity to menu
Author: By Fernanda Medici/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Gracie's Grill has changed its menu to better accommodate students' budgets and to give more choices to FIU faculty and staff. It also tried a new soft liquor menu that wasn't successful. 

In business for about 10 years, Gracie's Grill is located on the first floor of the Graham Center at the University Park campus, right next to Subway. 

Some students go to Gracie's to get their minds off homework, grab a quick bite to eat, or just relax and have a beer. 

Thursday is the busiest drinking night, said Walter Silva, assistant manager at Gracie's Grill and an FIU student, who attributes that night's high traffic to most students not having class on Fridays.

Before changes were made to the menu, Gracie's management asked FIU staff and students what would they like to see. The feedback resulted in new dishes and more low-priced menu options. Jose Fuentes, Gracie's Grill general manager, said sales have been good.

The restaurant introduced a "99 cents" menu, "to accommodate to the student who can't afford to bring that much money to school," Fuentes said.

The "99 cents" menu includes items like caf con leche, hamburgers, and salads. 

Fuentes said the new salads on the menu are becoming favorites with female students, who are into the newest "low carb" diets. 

Gracie's has also added some dishes that are similar to what it's competitors offer.

Chicken Kitchen, 9067 S.W. 107th Ave, has a dish called the Original Chop-Chop, which consists of yellow rice topped with chopped chicken breast. 

Gracie's Grill added a similar dish to their menu called Gracie's Original Chopped Chicken, which has yellow rice, chopped chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, and curry seasonings. Chicken Kitchen charges $4.59  for its Original Chop-Chop while Gracie's charges $3.99. 

Though the names of the new dishes may sound familiar, Fuentes said they are spelled different from the competition, but are similar so that people can recognize them and feel familiar with the dishes. 

Expanding the menu to include popular food choices makes it easier on students because they don't have to cross the street to get food off campus, said Fuentes.  He added that FIU staff members enjoy these new dishes the most because if they don't feel like eating a hamburger every day, they have the chopped chicken chop choices, which also include a Mexican style, with guacamole and sour cream and a Cuban style chop, with white rice and black beans. Also added  to the menu are new pasta dishes such as the chicken alfredo  and pink shrimp alfredo both for $3.99.

Gracie's is planning on sending out flyers to make students aware of the changes and to bring more people in to experience what they have created. 

Less successful additions to the Gracie's menu were cocktails, which are no longer on the menu.  

Rum and Cokes, Long Island Iced Teas and frozen cocktails on the Gracie's menu were made with a wine-based liquor, which is not as strong as the liquor served in other bars. The cocktails did not increase sales as much as the food did, and have since been removed from the menu. 

 Sophomore Diego Maldonado noticed the addition of the liquor, but said he never goes to Gracie's to drink. "I eat here everyday,"  said Maldonado, who loved the new Cuban style chop.

Some students have noticed the menu additions, say there are other areas where Gracie's can improve. 

"I like the '99 cents' menu...but I don't think the quality of the food is any better," said Dexter White, a junior. 

White, who eats at Gracie's about once a week and hangs out there when there for parties or get-togethers, said he didn't know gracie's sold cocktails.

Also new at Gracie's Grill are themed nights.  Tuesdays through Thursdays  Gracie's is now hosting Caribbean night, a Salsa night and a Ladies' night, all of them with a disc jockey playing music related to the theme. 

The goal  of the themed nights is to draw customers in and to make each night an enjoyable experience, but it has not yet led to a large increase in business.

Changes to the menu might not be the only thing to get a facelift at Gracie's. 

Fuentes suggested that in the summer Gracie's Grill might close for a little while to bring a more "fresh and hip" look to the eatery. 

As far as the Biscayne Bay Campus, there are no plans to expand over there any time soon, to the dismay of some students on that campus. 

"The Biscayne Bay Campus is boring and there is nothing really to eat there," said senior Jennifer Santos, who lives at BBC and usually brings food for her breaks between classes. 

For now, BBC students are still going to have to cross the street for beer or a 99-cent burger.

Headline: Coachella reigns with heart-stopping indie music showcase
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
When I first saw the official line up for the 2004 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, my heart stopped. 

Every once in a while, a concert comes along that stops you in your tracks. Staring at the webpage and the 80 plus bands who have confirmed, I am speechless and all I know is that I must do whatever it takes to get myself to Indio, Calif. on May 1 and 2. Anyone in need of a kidney?

Honestly, I never thought the day would come when I would see the Pixies reunite and perform live, let alone with The Cure, Stereolab, The Flaming Lips, and Kraftwerk.  The line up gets better; a plethora of several well-known and very respectable bands and artists have signed on to the list as well. 

The event is quickly gathering attention and creating an enormous buzz in the indie community. With such an impressive and diverse line up, this year's Coachella festival is sure to draw crowds from all over the world. There's already a community on Livejournal.com dedicated to the upcoming event. 

With its awesome roster of music, Coachella is shaping up to be one of the sickest concerts I have ever seen and I almost find it hard to believe, especially after the disaster that was The Field Day Music Festival.

Field Day, which was held least summer initially promised quite an impressive line up, although it paled in comparison to the upcoming Coachella festival. Everything seemed to be on schedule last June: people began to make roadtrips and flights up to Field Day's Long Island, NY home, but then disaster struck - a last minute venue change.  This forced nearly half of the impressive line up to cancel their scheduled performances. To make things worse, the two-day event was compressed into a one-day concert at Giants Stadium. Not even the weather cooperated.   It rained all day and into the night, making the entire event simply devastating.

Goldenvoice Records, which is presenting the Coachella festival, is working hard to make sure it won't become another disaster.  To ease those of you who, like myself, have been scarred by the Field Day tragedy, there are several factors that promise a smoother, more enjoyable festival.

This isn't the first Coachella music fest, and unlike Field Day, which was new and mostly disorganized, Coachella has been around since 1999. 

Past festivals enlisted the likes of Morrisey, Beck, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Sigur Rs, Bjrk, The Beastie Boys and more. So far, the festivals have been successful and, this being its fifth production, looks like it's bound to be the best.

There's just some things in life that you get good feelings about, and this is definitely one of them. It's hard to explain how important a festival like this is to today's music scene. There is an explosion of creativity occurring and so many exciting and new things are happening. Progression is the key and the Coachella music festival is the best event that will showcase such a movement in our musical times. Do not miss this, I know I won't.

Headline: Powerful acting, cinematography makes Noviembre a must-see
Author: Melissa C. Martinez/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"Art is a weapon loaded with future". This is the last of many truths perpetrated by Achero Manas' film "Noviembre." The Sundance Film Festival Awards winner in Cinematography was also a big hit at multiple screenings during the Miami International Film Festival.  

The film is a pseudo-docudrama about a group of theatre students who give up on the traditional and time-tested ways of selling their art and decide to hit the streets for a series of controversial street performances. From hijacking subways to city theatres the gang's wild antics prove more and more dangerous each time. They risk imprisonment and even death in an attempt to rock the foundations of our world.  

One of the standout films at this year's film festival, Noviembre grasps it's audience and takes them for a ride where the limits of social revolution as well as human idealism are pushed and then fiercely broken through.  

Documentary style footage mixed in with personal interviews of former street performers keeps things personal and realistic. Beautiful camera shots and powerful yet intimate acting by relatively unknown actors, Ingrid Rubio and Oscar Jaenada, are what drive this work of art and will inspire the viewer into a revolutionary fervor. Or at the very least make you bust a thought.

Headline: Gimmicks abound, lead to Trachtenburg family's success
Author: Evelyn McDonnell/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Everyone needs a gimmick. As their name hints, the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players have gimmicks by the bucketful.

Like the Brady Bunch and the Von Trapps, the band's three members are a nuclear family. 

Daughter Rachel - drummer, vocalist and raconteur - is 10 years old.

The Trachtenburgs wear punk-chic costumes, in silver and other hues, designed by Mom (Tina Pina Trachtenburg).

And of course, they have a slide show. 

In a gimmick to end all gimmicks, the Trachtenburgs' songs narrate slides that the band members find at garage sales and elsewhere. Some pictures are landscape postcards of strangers' 1950s vacations in Japan. Others offer glimpses into corporate meetings of the '70s. All are grist for dad Jason's songwriting mill. 

"The lyrics seem like they come out of nowhere, but they don't, they come out of these slide collections," Jason says over the phone from the Trachtenburg apartment in New York's East Village. "I love coming up with these mismatched images that would never be able to be paired up together, but we can turn into a rhyming couplet. It gives us a really unique feeling." 

The gimmicks have succeeded in lifting the Trachtenburgs out of the indie-rock mill: The family has been featured on the Sundance Channel and embraced by publications from Entertainment Weekly to The New Yorker.

But don't expect some silly family entertainment: Father Trachtenburg can talk your ear off about his hatred for the Disney Channel. The Trachtenburgs' songs often take macabre turns, and have political twists. 

"Of course we want to have a fun time," Jason says. "But we feel our calling is so much greater than that. We change people's lives and encourage people to take their creativity to whatever reality they can achieve. We're on to something bigger than all of us."

The Trachtenburgs' tale is not just a quirky art story. It's also a great love story. Tina, a Chicana from Texas, and Philadelphian Jason met at an open mike session in Manhattan in 1989. They moved to Seattle in the '90s, so Trachtenburg could try his hand in that city's vaunted music scene. He struggled in different bands, while the family paid their bills walking dogs. Then Tina suggested he supplement his act with visuals, and bought a projector and box of slides for $5.25.

Jason resisted at first. One day he threw the slides in. Out came "Mountain Trip to Japan, 1959," the act's first "hit." Tina joined Jason as costume designer and slide-show technician. Rachel initially played harmonica, then she took up Karen Carpenter's instrument. The Trachtenburgs developed a following in Seattle. In 2002 they decided to "take it to the grandest stage, which is New York," Jason says.

Now the band tours together in an old Suburban, having the sort of road-trip adventures that families have documented with slides for decades. The lifestyle fits the Trachtenburgs' alternative approach to parenting.

"We want to be together all the time," Jason says. "We don't want to be off at some job, or have Rachel be at some institution that isn't under our jurisdiction. We choose to live our lives as much as possible in the way that works for us."

"Mountain Trip," the lead track on the act's first album, "Vintage Slide Collections from Seattle, Vol. 1," released last year, typifies the way Jason's offbeat view of the world collides with visual slices of Americana. The song starts with descriptions of fairly conventional scenic views: "Classic cars on a mountain slope...this boat will soon be boarding." But then there's the shot of the graveyard, and the tombstone, and then one Jason swears is of a public execution. Suddenly the anonymous old couple's trip turns morbid. "Death will come in a matter of time," Jason sings in a philosophical lilt.

There's humor, but there's also social commentary. In conversation, Trachtenburg, who looks the quintessential geek in thick-rimmed glasses, speaks with the breathless enthusiasm of a skeptical idealist. "There's always going to be some sort of irony and bitterness in our songs, but they're also optimistic and realistic," he says. He also says, "Oh criminy."

Quirky as tracks like "Eggs" are lyrically, musically, they're pure pop. Jason's biggest heroes are the Beatles. His No. 1 role models are They Might Be Giants, the oddball New York duo who create great TV theme songs AND idiosyncratic albums. 

"They make music completely outside of the norm," Jason Trachtenburg says. "I know where they're coming from."
