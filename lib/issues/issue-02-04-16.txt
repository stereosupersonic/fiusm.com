FIU ended the four-game weekend Sun Belt series with Western Kentucky (37-20, 8-8 SBC) the same way it began, tied for second place in the conference.

The two teams will begin the Sun Belt Tournament against each other again at 1:30 p.m. Thursday, May 9 at the FIU Softball Stadium.

  Western Kentucky 4, FIU 0

In the final game of the series, WKU's Rockie Castillo knocked out the Golden Panthers (38-32, 8-8 SBC) with her fifth shutout of the season.

Shelly Floyd delivered all the offense Castillo needed with two hits and two RBI. 

Leah Barnes (5-9) took the loss despite pitching well for FIU, allowing only one earned run in four innings of work while striking out three.

With a 2-0 lead, Floyd capped off the Hilltoppers' scoring with the fourth consecutive single off reliever Kendra Laminack that brought home two more runs to make it 4-0.

FIU leads the all-time series 9-4.

FIU 3, Western Kentucky 1

Vanessa Preston (13-10) continued her impressive pitching on the weekend by recording her second win of the series in a 3-1 FIU win.

Preston, who felt a little shoulder tendonitis earlier in the week, pitched 4.1 innings allowing one hit and struck out five.

Preston pitched 8.2 innings in the series surrendering only two earned runs and struck out seven.

Amanda Nealer again was lights out coming out of the bullpen to nail down her sixth save of the season.

Preston and Nealer gave up only four hits.

The Golden Panthers batted around in the third inning against Allison Silver (17-9) to take a 3-0 lead.

Dubovik laid down a bunt single, stole her 27th base of the season and scored on Lindsay Tippings' RBI single to put FIU on top 1-0.

After Tippings scored on an error, Jennifer Owens (2 for 4) delivered another run scoring single to make it 3-0.

Western Kentucky 7, FIU 3

The Golden Panthers out-hit the Hilltoppers 13-5, but but fell 7-3.

FIU jumped out to a 3-0 lead, but five walks by Golden Panther pitching led to the defeat.

Relying on their running game the Golden Panthers started the scoring on a double steal by Marleah Stapf and Dubovik after they each reached base on hits.

Crystal Boyer's RBI single scored Dubovik and Lesley Gillen's single brought home Wolter to give FIU the early lead.

WKU rallied with a four run third inning highlighted by Jessie Richardson's home run off Kendra Laminack (8-8) who took the loss.  

FIU 3, Western Kentucky 2

Relying on one of its strengths, pitching, FIU began the four game series with Western Kentucky on a high note with a narrow 3-2 victory.

Preston, Laminack and Nealer combined on the four-hitter for FIU.

Down 1-0, Owens tied it for FIU with an RBI single in the fourth and Sabrina Smith's fielder's choice scored Gillen to give FIU a 2-1 lead

The Hilltoppers rallied in the bottom of the fifth to close the gap to 3-2 after loading the bases and threatening to take the lead.

But as usual FIU spelled relief, N-E-A-L-E-R as Nealer struck out Melissa Gomes with the bases loaded to end the rally.

The FIU closer went on to retire six of the final seven batters she would face to record her fifth save.

FIU 1, FAU 0

In their six previous meetings this season with the No. 10 ranked Florida Atlantic Owls, the Golden Panthers have scored only three runs.

To get one of their biggest wins of the season, FIU needed only one run as the Golden Panthers ruined the Owls Senior Night with a 1-0 win.

Saddled with a five-game losing streak and facing anupcoming four-game Sun Belt series at Western Kentucky, the Golden Panthers (36-30) pulled out all the stops to secure the win.

Locked in a pitcher's duel with FAU's three-time All-American Nikki Myers, Leah Barnes, who had a no-hitter into the fifth, kept her composure by allowing only one hit in 5.1 innings while striking out six.

Barnes, who didn't know she was starting until the last minute when Preston came down with minor shoulder tendonitis, relished the opportunity.

"I like starting games and I'm feeling better every time I've gotten the opportunity," Barnes said.  "Starting a game builds my confidence and I feel like my old self."

Catcher Sabrina Smith helped to manufacture the game's only run with both her arm and legs.

In the top of the fifth, with Smith second base and Stephanie Wolter at the plate, the Owls had its third baseman Rhianna Rogers pulled in close to protect against the bunt.

Faced with the possibility of pinch-hitting for on-deck slap hitter Kelly Nicosia, Gwydir noticed Rogers playing in and the Owls playing with a backup shortstop in Christina Thompson.

Gwydir gave Smith, who had only one stolen base on the season, the steal sign and Smithstole thid base without a throw when Thompson got confused on whether to cover third base or not.

"With Kelly being a slap hitter, it's a lot harder to get the runner home from second base," Gywdir said.  "And I didn't want to pinch hit for her (Nicosia) with her being one of our top hitters and all.  We had a better chance to get Sabrina home if she was on third."

Smith was on third and after Wolter struck out, Nicosia, who played her freshman season at FAU, barely got a piece of Myers' drop ball and top spun an infield hit towards first base.

"I never got a good piece of the drop ball," Nicosia said.  "I mis-hit it, but a hit's a hit no matter what."

Smith scored and FIU led 1-0.

Nealer quieted the Owls in the 6th, but ran into trouble in the bottom of the 7th. FAU got a couple of runners on in the seventh and brought their leading homerun hitter Myersto the plate.Myers walked for the fourth time in the game to load the bases.   

The game came down to pinch-hitter Jessica Fernandez versus Nealer.

Nealer jumped out in front of Fernandez with two strikes before she got her swinging on a high fastball to secure the win.

Headline: After the election: former presidential ticket reassess goals after loss
Author: Mario M. Sarria Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On April 2 and 3, running mates Armando Rodriguez and Maria Garcia could be seen in Graham Center and outside the Green Library speaking to students about the issues at FIU and their goals if elected as student government president and vice president.

Despite their effort, their campaign did not lead to a victory on April 4 in the Student Government Council elections. Jessica Morffi and Omar Castillo instead proved victorious. 

Rodriguez and Garcia believe this was a learning experience and look forward to life after student government.  

The tension leading up to the announcement of the results took its toll on Rodriguez, a junior majoring in finance and international business.

"This was a culmination of everything I've done on campus," Rodriguez said. "It was a shock to me, not because of the consecutive Sigma Alpha Mu SGA presidents, just because we worked so hard."

Although a major disappointment for himself, Rodriguez says the hardest thing to do is face the people who supported him.

"It's hard seeing so many people upset," Rodriguez said. "Running into people who wanted us to win and [seeing] them distraught that we lost the election. That bothers me, because I wanted to be there for the students."

Garcia, an English and political science major was shocked when she heard Elections Commissioner Malik Wilkes announce the results.

"It was surprising but I was OK with the results," she said. "As long as I knew that I tried my best I was OK with what happened. There's always another day."

According to Garcia, regardless of the results of the election, she continues to have the same feelings about FIU.

"There is nothing that can keep me away from participating at FIU," Garcia said. "Because I love this school, I love the students, I love seeing what's going on around school."

Garcia says she will continue with her plans regardless of the loss.

"I plan on going on with things as if we had won, such as getting involved with Dance Marathon, honor societies on campus, and even SGA," he said. "Even though we lost, I'm going to be strong and still be there for the students. I'm still going to participate."

Alex Zarut, who worked with Garcia in Dance Marathon, said she has great potential.

"I think she has great potential for SGA as long as this defeat does not keep her from serving on chair or positions in this upcoming year," Zarut said.

Rodriguez on the other hand, is still thinking about his plans and his role in the FIU community. Currently, Rodriguez is evaluating starting an organization or a club on FIU that will be specifically aimed towards lobbying state legislators.

"Maria and I were actually thinking of starting this organization before the elections," Rodriguez said. "Maybe I'll stay in SGA and persue that."
Rodriguez says he has many options, however he is currently evaluating his role in FIU.

"There's a lot of aspects I could go into but as of now I have to redefine my role [at FIU]," Rodriguez said. "This is still my home."

With three years of experience in SGC, Rodriguez hopes the best for the new SGC council.

"Just because we lost we don't want to see SGC go down, we hope SGC wins 'SGC of the year' again," Rodriguez said.

Rodriguez said Morffi and Castillo can come to him if they ever need any help.

"If she needs any help with her email project I hope she comes and asks us for help," he said.

Regardless of the results, Rodriguez said he and Garcia will continue with their goals.

 "If there is a way we can make our platform happen without us being president and vice president, we'll find [a way to do it]," he said.
Rodriguez and Garcia believe they learned from their campaigns and are both positive regardless of the results.

"I don't feel like I've lost," Rodriguez said. "I've gained so much from running in this election. It was really encouraging because we found a lot of students who supported us, students who never got involved in politics before were campaigning for us." 

After the elections, Rodriguez still remains close to his supporters.

"When you're out there campaigning your platform with people you just met doing the same thing just as passionately, knowing you're going to the same place to make signs or go and make pamphlets, and they'll still be there again early in the morning," Rodriguez said. "You get really tight with these people and to these people I'm extremely grateful."

Garcia agrees that their support provided them with strengths.

"It showed me how much support I really have, that's what kept me going," Garcia said. "I learned how I can take certain things like the pressure and I can take that into working hard for something and how passionate I am about student government."

Both Rodriguez and Garcia's current terms as representative at large and Honors College representative, respectively, will end when the spring semester does – about two weeks from now.

Victor Romano, whose term as SGC president also ends at the end of spring, believes Rodriguez and Garcia had very successful and active terms.

"Their dedication and commitment to students and the improvement to FIU is phenomenal," Romano said. "Together I think they passed more legislation than any other legislator on the council."

Both Rodriguez and Garcia agreed that during their campaigns they realized who their real friends are.

"We've been given so much during this campaign, so many people stayed up late doing this and that, basically campaigning their hearts out," Rodriguez said. "We had a lot of fun in our campaign, we got close together and we're still tight."

Romano said he sees great things in Rodriguez's and Garica's future.

"I think in whatever they do they're going to be successful and get what they desire. They're not quitters," Romano said. "They are the type of people that persevere no matter what and I wish them the very best in FIU and in life."

Headline: Letter to the Editor: 'Winners and Losers' mocks alternative spring break
Author: Robert Fernandez III
&nbsp;
To the editor:

I was disappointed with the article that ran in The Beacon on April 2, 2002. I was also disturbed by the comment about Alternative Spring Break in Winners and Losers. I participated with this year's Ground Zero crew and know that the information in the article was incorrect and inaccurately quoted. I want the truth told. 

The ASB crew was split into three shifts: a 7 a.m. – 3:00 p.m. morning shift, a 3 p.m. – 11 p.m. day shift, and an 11 p.m. – 7 a.m. graveyard shift. A site leader led each shift. The site leader was responsible for the four other people in the shift (with the exception of the graveyard site leader who had six people).  We toured New York in shifts, not as the seventeen-person crew that we went up with.  

We had a number of duties to perform in the Salvation Army tent. One was to prevent food from leaving the tent because there were contaminants in the area of ground zero.  Many of us had the opportunity to sit with the men who worked in "the pit." "The pit" is the hole where the WTC once stood. 

We also visited the local memorial around St. Paul's Chapel and were permitted to go inside the chapel, which serves as a sanctuary for the workers.  Inside the chapel, the walls are covered from floor to ceiling in letters, banners, and posters of thanks and appreciation for the ground workers.

Everyone knows about the New York Fire Departments and Police Departments, but often there's no mention of the Port Authority police officers, who lost the most police officers in the Sept. 11 attacks.  We must also mention the laborers, machinists and steel workers who contribute to the clean up efforts at ground zero.  

The laborers sweep and collect loose debris that has already been removed and checked for human remains.  Machinists are the men who operate the different machines that are needed to be able to move all the heavy debris.  The steel workers cut the enormous beams that need to be removed and have rescued firemen by their under-appreciated work.  Juan, a steel worker I befriended, told me that he cut a steel sheet that revealed the bodies of eight firemen.  He said, "They were bowed almost as if in prayer."  

Many firemen refer to Ground Zero and the pit as "Hell," and the smell in the pit is referred to as "the smell of death." I know this because I sat with a group of firemen who had just come out of the pit.  

One of them had a piece of flesh stuck on his boot. A fireman told me, "You are my hero because you left tits and ass to come here and help us." 

This is why the comment in Winners and Losers disturbed me: because you mocked the sacrifice we made and that our country has made.

Headline: Letter to the Editor #2: Budget administration needs to focus on energy conservation
Author: Elvira Martinez
&nbsp;
To the editor:

I was in the environmental studies floor in ECS waiting to talk to one of my professors, when I came across a memo posted on the bulletin board dated March 22, 2001 from the Office of the President.

In short it stated that FIU was facing water shortages, but it also included an interesting point: energy conservation. 

This memo signed by the president of FIU stated: "Our recent billings from FPL indicate that our costs this year will be $1 million more than last year. 

Since we do not get funded to deal with such increases, the revenues must come from our current budget. This causes us to have less funds for other priority items."

Immediately I thought: [We] don't have paper, [yet] we're freezing in our classrooms, and we're surrounded by excessively lit areas.

It goes further than that. Walking around campus during the daytime you can see outdoor lighting turned on, the breezeway of the library is always lit and our classrooms are so cold that you have to bring a sweater with you. 

At night, you are blinded by all the ineffective lighting we have for trees, walls, etc. 

I decided to look some of this stuff up, and it turns out that we don't even take the simplest step to conserve energy, which is to use the most efficient bulbs available to us.  Most of the light is wasted anyway since it is facing sideways and in some cases straight up. 

Then I thought maybe all the computers are to blame, but it turns out that when a computer is on for an average of 10 hours a day, it uses only six kilowatts and costs only about 48 cents a month to run. 

Which brings us back to the real culprits: air conditioning and poor lighting. The school is clearly spending millions just on electricity, and most of it isn't even properly used. Because of the lack of planning, we have to be without necessary things like a syllabus. 

We have to go through the scare of no summer session, and now that we will have summer classes, some of us cant even advance within our major since this is one of the worst course offerings in recent years. 

The memo ends with, "Finally, I have asked Vice-Presidents Gallagher and Breslin to chair a committee of faculty, staff and students charged with the development of a conservation plan for FIU." Again, this memo is dated March 22, 2001, and to this day I have not heard of it. 

I can only imagine that with the new buildings and influx of students, next year's budget will be even smaller for other items such as class offerings, teacher's salaries, and syllabi.  

I am sure, however, that I will still be blinded by all the "safety lighting" that only impairs my vision at night and will still need a sweater to sit through class.

FIU Summer School: After being in jeopardy earlier this year, FIU summer school makes its return. It's a sigh of relief for many students who won't have to graduate a semester late because of one or two classes.

FIU Softball: Congratulations on winning three out of your four last games. Once again, FIU can turn to their women's teams for success. If this trend continues, any chance we'll have a female football team on the horizon?

Big Trouble: Only making $6 Million in the past two weeks is just plain sad. That sounds like  big trouble to us.   Don't worry Dave; Hollywood can be a cruel place, but  we still love you – sometimes.

Headline: In Our View: UP President-elect should take opponent's ideas into account
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Congratulations should go out to the winning ticket of Jessica Morffi and Omar Castillo for a well-run campaign and for being the first ticket in what seems like eons to break the tight grip Sigma Alpha Mu had on the University Park presidency. It will be interesting to see how the new administration handles itself during the critical early stages of the year. 

Though we could only select one ticket as our suggestion to our readers, it was by no means an easy decision. Both tickets, as we said, were very similar. 

It is essential that the new president and vice president put aside whatever rivalries arose during the election and take a close look at some of the things their opponents campaigned for. If there is one thing that affects all students, it's money. And reducing needless costs to students was a major issue for the Rodriguez/Garcia ticket. Ideas like eliminating ATM surcharges and allowing the use of credit cards in the cafeteria and other food vendors would benefits all students greatly. 

But because these ideas were initiated by a losing ticket, they should not disappear in the political shuffle. By combining both ideas and moving toward a more unified student government, Morffi and Castillo could set a powerful precedent for future administrations. 

In the past the victorious tickets have ignored what their opponents had to say, discounting the fact that usually the losing ticket represents a large portion of the voters.The new administration should focus on what got them elected and move forward with their initial plans, but, by at least considering other ideas, they will in turn show they are not merely taking office to cater to the students that cast votes for them.

Headline: Financial irresponsibility affects summer term
Subheadline: FIU administration should place students first. reestablish priorities
Author: Jason Andreasen
&nbsp;
Because of FIU's irresponsible financial planning, the summer term was threatened. Now, FIU forces us into a summer term with fewer options than we deserve. 

Last semester, President Madique announced that he had authorized the use of FIU's emergency funds in order to provide a summer session. 

Wouldn't it seem important for us, especially in these uncertain times, to maintain our emergency funds for an actual emergency? 

Instead, due to the administration's inefficient use of FIU's money, not only is the quality of the education of its students questioned, but also the very existence of summer classes at all has been in limbo. 

I am quite glad that the university will hold a summer session. In fact, I will be one of the many students taking advantage of the classes offered. However, the fact of the matter is that the summer session should never have been in jeopardy. 

Over the past year, the financial planning of FIU has caused many problems for the university, like the absence of printed syllabi. It seemed to the administration that these vital documents were expendable. 

However, what seemed more important was to have marble flooring put in the financial aid department. 

Instead of having documents telling students what was required of them to pass their classes, the Board of Trustees decided it was more important to make the floor of the financial aid department more aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, these are not even the most glaring actions.

At a December meeting of the Board of Trustees they decided, due to the weakening economy, to approve a $12 million budget cut . 

What is so mind-boggling is that at that exact same meeting, they approved an $83,000 per year raise for President Madique. As a result, programs and jobs were cut. 

In short, the money put towards our education took a $12 million cut, but Madique's checkbook got another $83,000. 

I hope that as the new "voices" of the student body – the newly elected SGA president and vice-president – will work to not allow such injustices to go by unchallenged as they have in the past.

As a result of the financial crisis FIU created for itself, the summer term has taken a severe slashing in the number of course offerings. 

This forces students to enroll in classes when they would much rather take others. It prevents them from taking the classes that they need to in order to get ahead in their major, or those which they need to retake. These are not issues we should be facing. 

It is time that FIU's administration realize that their priorities should center around the quality of the education of the students. While administrators have increased enrollment figures, they give little regard to those students already here. 

What they fail to realize is that universities are judged upon the quality of the graduates they produce, not what type of tile they have on the floors of their financial aid office. 

If the administration wants to see this school as a business, let's indulge them: Even if a company's factory is state-of-the-art, if their product is not better, or at least up-to-par with that of the competition, they will go bankrupt. 

In the long run, this will create an even worse financial situation, with much more at stake than the President's hefty raise. If the administration cannot see that, then I suggest that they register for Intro to Economics over the summer. Then again, they might not be able to find the course available.

Editor's Note: President Maidique's raise does not go into effect until November, in accordance with his wishes.

Headline: United States gives green light to repressive measures
Author: Kevin Martin/Knight-Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
With the commencement of the Afghanistan campaign six months ago, the United States gave the green light to governments around the world to solve their problems through violence. All they need to do is cite the United States war in Afghanistan, which began Oct. 7, or call their opponents "terrorists." 

The web site of Human Rights Watch lists dozens of countries, from Australia to Zimbabwe, where civil liberties are being threatened, legitimate dissent is being crushed or warfare is being waged more brutally, all in the name of the war on terrorism. 

In many armed conflicts, there are indeed terrorists. That's not the point. 

The point is that, just as in Afghanistan, justice is not being served by killing more people. The war on terror, whether waged in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Putumayo, Kashmir or elsewhere, will not work. 

It will not make Americans, Afghanis, Israelis, Colombians, Indians or Pakistanis safer. It will only bring more death, more "collateral damage," more grieving families, more anger and despair, all of which sow the seeds of future terrorist attacks. 

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the other wars mentioned do predate Sept. 11, many by decades. The United States did not cause them. 

But make no mistake: We enable the killing. Uncle Sam, as the world's number-one weapons dealer, has armed one or more sides in nearly every war worldwide. 

We set the example in terms of strategy as well. By announcing an all-out war on terrorism – that, according to the Bush administration, may not end in our lifetimes and could extend to up to 60 countries accused of harboring terrorists – we, the unchallenged world leader, say that war is the answer.

The United States is in a unique position to provide global leadership toward real solutions for a safer world. 

We should work to strengthen the force of law, not the law of force, by supporting institutions such as the proposed permanent International Criminal Court to deal with acts of terror. And as the strongest military power in the history of the world, we are uniquely qualified – obliged even – to lead a global effort to abolish nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. 

The United States needs to end its shameful status as arms merchant to the world. We need to build goodwill by increasing foreign aid even more substantially than the recent hike and by promoting sustainable and just development programs. We need to take a hard look at our policies in the Middle East and revamp them to reflect cherished American values like democracy and respect for human rights. 

One needn't be a pacifist to observe this: War isn't solving the world's problems. After more than 40 years, it has not brought peace, justice or security to Colombians, Israelis, Palestinians, Kashmiris, Pakistanis, Indians, Congolese or Angolans. 

Americans who think a blank check for the Pentagon and an open-ended commitment to wage war on terror will make us safer should look at those conflicts and think again. 

President Bush has asked us to be patient with the war on terrorism. Shouldn't we instead be patient in trying less violent, more practical and realistic solutions to the world's problems? 

Kevin Martin is the executive director of Peace Action.

Headline: Media needs to improve representation of religious individuals
Author: David Pulgar
&nbsp;
Religion is a topic most people avoid in their day to day conversations. We've been hearing so much about religion lately but none of the coverage has been good. 

If it's not a suicide bomber then it's another Catholic priest who molested a child. With coverage like that you would assume there is no hope for our world. 

This country is built on the fundamental principle of free speech and the media is fortunate to operate under such conditions. As I watch the news each morning or read the newspaper I wonder what happened to that balanced view the media is supposed to provide. Everything I watch on television is a bad representation of religious individuals and religion in general. 

Occasionally you have some stories that portray hope for our civilization, but those are few and far between. And what does the media think of religion? 

Do they assume one bad apple ruins the bunch? All I've seen lately when religion comes up in a news story is negative coverage. Unfortunately the masses love controversy and economics prefers we cater to the majority. News has become sensationalized and meant to entertain more and inform less. 

Whenever anyone makes a mistake the media jumps on it like a vicious animal, and this is especially true for religious organizations. 

I'm not saying this is bad because it helps keep society in check, but what ever happened to telling the whole story? Religious groups always get more heat when they make a mistake, because everyone expects them to be perfect. 

The fact is everyone has shortcomings that must be dealt with accordingly and religious organizations are no different. There will always be fanatic groups in this world and these extremists tarnish their faith's reputation. 

Still, what about Mother Teresa or Gandhi? These are globally recognized figures who represented the best in their faith. So much good happens locally on an day-to-day basis, and yet we ignore it because it is not palatable to our audiences. 

We're not going to sell papers with happiness right? Who would want to buy airtime on a network that only showcases good news stories? 

What is news? Must the news always be about some boy getting run over by a car or another murder suicide? Walter Cronkite said it best, "And that's the way it is." He closed all his newscasts with the same powerful statement. It is the media that decides what is news. A hefty power for anyone. 

The media is responsible for providing a balanced, unbiased view of our world. People need to see the good along with the bad. 

The fact of the matter is that bad apples will always hang from trees but lets not destroy the good ones by chopping the tree down.

Headline: Tennis to play Miami in NCAA's after reaching SBC finals
Author: Pete Pelegrin / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
After failing to defeat South Alabama in the Sun Belt final for the fifth straight year, the No. 25 Golden Panther tennis team received an at-large bid into the NCAA Tournament, which begins May 10.

FIU will travel to Gainesville for an all-Florida regional. The Golden Panthers (18-6) will meet cross-town rival No. 32 Miami (14-6) in the opening round. Top-ranked Florida (19-1) will play Central Florida (11-11). The winners will meet the following day and the regional winner will move on to the Sweet 16 on May 16 at Stanford.

"It is really exciting to be selected again to the tournament and keep the tradition alive," head coach Ronni Bernstein said. "But its been tough the last couple of weeks waiting and we had been keeping our fingers crossed."

The reason for the waiting game came courtesy of conference rival South Alabama, who defeated FIU in the Sun Belt finals, 4-0.

South Alabama 4, FIU 0

Entering the Sun Belt Conference Tournament as the No.1 seed, FIU (18-6) exited the tournament as second best after South Alabama put an end to the Golden Panthers' hopes for the program's first Sun Belt title.

Headline: Atrapado y sin seguro
Subheadline: Tanya Lerner

&nbsp;
Si cree que hizo un buen negocio al haber comprado la opción más barata para asegurar su carro, mejor revise con cuidado su contrato porque puede estar equivocado. Este &#8220;ahorro&#8221; le puede salir caro.

Algunos agentes de seguros de carro en Miami ofrecen una prima más baja que la de sus competidores, al incluir descuentos que no aplican al carro asegurado ni a su conductor. De este modo, el agente &#8220;atrapa&#8221; al cliente, al vender el seguro y cobrar su comisión por venta. Sin embargo, el asegurado resulta perjudicado sin saberlo, al tener que pagar más tarde un reajuste en la prima de su seguro, equivalente al valor de los descuentos que le fueron ofrecidos erróneamente.

Frances Alvarado y su novio Daniel Laó compraron la póliza de seguros para su carro con The Gainsco Companies sin imaginar que una semana más tarde recibirían una notificación de la compañía, en la que se les informaba que debían cancelar una prima adicional: &#8220;dimos un &#8216;down payment&#8217; de $287 en efectivo, y supuestamente el pago cada mes quedaría en $121.25. Cuando llegó el segundo pago nos pedían $211.57, lo que significa que quedamos a deber como 400 y pico dólares más&#8221;.  

Cuando Frances y Daniel llamaron a The Gainsco Companies les explicaron que los descuentos que había incluido la agencia no aplicaban a su vehículo. 

Según la guía para el consumidor sobre el Seguro de Automóvil del Departamento de Seguros de la Florida, si el agente cotiza una prima incorrecta, la compañía de seguros debe enmendar ese error. Si el cliente ha pagado en exceso, la compañía le enviará un cheque de reembolso. Si, por el contrario,  no pagó lo suficiente, la compañía le enviará una cuenta y le ofrecerá las siguientes opciones: pagar la prima adicional para la fecha indicada por la compañía si se quiere mantener la cobertura, o cancelar la póliza y obtener un reembolso de la prima. Si el cliente no toma ninguna decisión, la compañía tiene derecho a cancelar la póliza. 
 
Si se solicita la cancelación de la póliza y el reembolso correspondiente, Jorge Castellano, Especialista de Seguro del Departamento de Seguros del Estado de la Florida, señala que el valor del reembolso podría resultar mucho más bajo que el que se esperaría, toda vez que la compañía de seguros deduce del reembolso algunos costos. Según Castellano, haciendo un cálculo aproximado y no preciso, pues depende de cada compañía de seguros, si se da una cuota inicial de $200, el cliente podría recibir tan sólo $30 de reembolso, aún cuando el carro hubiera estado asegurado por pocas semanas.

Cómo operan

Como parte de la investigación se llenó una solicitud en el website www.insweb.com para obtener cotizaciones de los agentes de seguros afiliados. Al día siguiente, se recibió una llamada de un agente de Allstate que ofreció una prima inferior a otros.   

Se nos explicó rápidamente la cobertura de la póliza, sin mencionar que había descuentos que no coincidían con los datos llenados en la solicitud enviada por Internet, y que por esa razón, la prima del seguro salía $70 más barata a través de este agente de seguros.

Luego de revisar la copia de la cotización se le manifestó al agente que no correspondía a la realidad, y ésta indicó: &#8220;no te preocupes porque eso yo siempre lo hago; yo trato de poner todos los descuentos y nunca ha habido problema. Un señor al que le hice un seguro hace poco tuvo un accidente en la Calle 8 yendo a Naples y mató una persona; él tenía 20.000 de lesiones personales y la compañía se los ha pagado. Nunca nos han llamado, que si fue dueño de casa. Entonces, ¿me entiendes que eso cuando va a un reclamo no lo van a chequear?&#8221;.  

Al consultar la práctica de este agente de seguros con Delia Izquierdo, una de sus colegas de Allstate, ella comentó que &#8220;esa no es una forma correcta de trabajar; uno tiene que darle a la persona lo que en realidad tiene&#8221;. Para Delia  Izquierdo, su colega acude a métodos fraudulentos &#8220;para hacer la venta; para estar más competitivo&#8221;.

Otra modalidad que utilizan algunos funcionarios de las agencias al vender los seguros de carro, es incluir en la póliza los descuentos que corresponden, pero cobrándole al cliente una prima mayor, haciendo de cuenta que no aplicaban los descuentos. De esta manera, el agente de seguros no sólo gana con la comisión por la venta del seguro, sino que además se queda con la diferencia del valor de la prima cobrada de más a su cliente.

A dónde acudir 

Jorge Castellano, del Departamento de Seguros del Estado de la Florida, señala que en estos casos, donde el agente de seguros actúa de manera irregular, el cliente afectado en el condado Miami-Dade debe acudir a la División de Servicios para Consumidores de ese Departamento (401 NW y 2 Avenida Oficina N-307) y llenar un formulario explicando las circunstancias del caso, junto con la documentación apropiada, que puede consistir en cartas, recibos, facturas, contratos y anuncios. También puede llamar a la línea de servicio al consumidor al (305) 377-5235 y enviar el formulario de petición de ayuda por correo. El formulario puede obtenerse en el website www.doi.state.fl.us. 

También se puede hacer un reclamo ante la compañía de seguros directamente. En el caso de la póliza de seguros de Allstate se llamó directamente a la compañía y se denunció al agente. Allstate indicó que seguirá un procedimiento interno para determinar si el agente incumplió la reglamentación de la compañía, y en tal caso, considerará la posibilidad de retirarle la licencia.   

El procedimiento ante el Departamento de Seguros del Estado de la Florida puede llegar inclusive más lejos que cancelarle la licencia a un agente de seguros. Si la División de Servicios para Consumidores encuentra que hay méritos para iniciar una investigación más profunda, remite el caso al Buró de Investigaciones de Agentes y Agencias del Departamento. Patsy Bartola, funcionaria de este buró, explicó que la investigación de ellos se basa en determinar si existe &#8220;evidencia suficiente y clara para presentar una acción administrativa&#8221;. En caso de ser contundente la evidencia, el encargado de continuar la investigación será la División Criminal de Fraude. Si el caso prospera, el agente de seguros fraudulento podría terminar en la cárcel.

Sin embargo, el agente de seguros no es el único que podría terminar en la cárcel. De acuerdo con las leyes del Estado de la Florida, "cualquier persona que con conocimiento y con la intención de dañar, defraudar, o engañar a cualquier asegurador presente una declaración de reclamo o una solicitud conteniendo cualquier información falsa, incompleta o engañosa, es culpable de un crimen de tercer grado&#8221;. Esta advertencia se encuentra impresa en los formularios de todas las compañías de seguros de carro.

De manera que la próxima vez que compre el seguro de su carro, asegúrese de que la información que aparece en su solicitud es correcta. De lo contrario, recuerde que en vez de estar ahorrando unos cuantos dólares, podría acabar pagando mucho más, o inclusive, quedar atrapado sin seguro.

Es curioso encontrar esta comunidad judía-Ortodoxa en medio de una ciudad donde las palmeras, la playa y el sol le inducen al cuerpo a cubrirse escasamente con shorts, faldas y camiseta. 

Sin embargo, entre la Collins Avenue y el área donde comienza Miami Beach existen estos grupos de familias vestidos de una manera &#8220;extraña&#8221; para los no saben quienes son. 

Al realizar mi observación ya no sabía quien tenía más calor, si mi cámara o yo, y esto no era solamente por el clima sino por el sólo hecho de verlos caminar tan  pausadamente por estas calles, como si el mundo que los rodeara no les &#8220;tocara&#8221; el suyo, ni les alterara su destino en medio de los tapones, la bulla de los carros convertibles y el sonido de las ruedas de los skaters.

Todos los viernes la vanidad cotidiana que coge forma y vida en el &#8220;estilo&#8221; de South Beach hacen un cuadro de contrastes con el negro de estos caminantes, quienes tienen un destino que no es precisamente el de las personas que conducen sus autos; ni tampoco el de los que caminan con un walkman en su cabeza en vez de un sombrero.

Hay quienes piensan que la risa y la diversión son las mejores medicinas tanto para el cuerpo como para el alma. Y esta es la filosofía de Radio Lollipop, una particular emisora de radio que funciona en el Miami Children&#8217;s Hospital. Su objetivo es entretener, divertir y brindar cariño a todos los niños y jóvenes hospitalizados a través de diferentes tipos de juegos y actividades.

¿Cómo se entretienen los niños que viven en los hospitales? Para estos pequeños pacientes el día, las semanas y los meses transcurren dentro de un mismo espacio: el hospital, donde las diversiones y los amigos son muy pocos. 

Para Radio Lollipop todos sus radioescuchas son importantes, por eso los voluntarios van a las habitaciones de los pacientes: pequeños y no tan pequeños, para motivarlos e involucrarlos en las diferentes actividades de la  estación. Aquí todo se vale y en muchas ocasiones los roles se invierten y son los niños los presentadores del programa, mientras que los locutores los asisten con la música que solicitan. 
&#8220;Lo que más les gusta a los niños es cuando los voluntarios entran a los cuartos para invitarlos a participar en la radio. Esta es una forma de dar alegría y aliento a todos los pequeños del hospital&#8221;, comentó Lynn Heyman, Directora y Coordinadora de Radio Lollipop. 

La Radio trabaja tres días a la semana y cada uno tiene un nombre diferente:"Terrific Tuesday&#8221;, &#8220;Wacky Wenesday&#8221; y &#8220;Thrilling Thursday&#8221;.  Aunque la programación tiene una duración de dos horas, el equipo de voluntarios que ahí trabaja pasa mucho más tiempo planeando y preparando las actividades del día.       

El próximo 14 de agosto Radio Lollipop cumplirá 6 años de labores en el Miami Children&#8217;s Hospital, el primer hospital en auspiciar esta organización caritativa en los Estados Unidos. Antes de iniciar sus funciones en el Miami Children&#8217;s Hospital, la organización pasó un año recaudando todos los fondos necesarios para comenzar a trabajar.  

Actualmente, Radio Lollipop cuenta con un grupo de 45 voluntarios y recibe donaciones de compañías como: McArthur Dairy, Norman Shulevitz Foundation, John Alden Corporation, Kiwanis Club of Miami, Delta Airlines Employees, Junior League y Hero Productions.
  
Radio Lollipop es una organización internacional fundada en 1979, por Hed Leyfinn, en el Queen Mary&#8217;s Hospital de Inglaterra.  Hoy en día esta sociedad sin fines de lucro se encuentra en Inglaterra, Australia, Nueva Zelanda y Estados Unidos y opera en 15 hospitales infantiles alcanzando a más de un cuarto de millón de niños al año. 

Cualquier compañía o individuo que quiera realizar algún tipo de donación o participar como voluntario se puede comunicar con Radio Lollipop llamando al (305)669-6537 o visitando su página web  http://www.radiolollipop.org/.

&#8220;Y tu mamá también&#8221;... el último viaje

Tenoch Iturbide  y Julio Zapata son amigos inseparables y al terminar el colegio sólo les interesa pasar unas buenas vacaciones mientras sus novias viajan a Italia. Sexo, marihuana y cerveza son los ingredientes indispensables para pasarlo bien. 

Tenoch y Julio conocen a Luisa, esposa de un primo de Tenoch,  quien al recibir malas noticias decide acompañarlos en el viaje a la playa. Durante éste, Luisa hará que  estos  niños, que se creen hombres, descubran cosas impensables de sí mismos.

"Y tu mamá también" no es la típica comedia de adolescentes y sus aventuras con sexo, alcohol y drogas. El director Alfonso Cuarón  se vale de personajes o circunstancias ajenas a Tenoch, Julio y Luisa, para contar paralelamente otra historia, la del México donde se desarrolla el viaje. La corrupción de las autoridades, los accidentes automovilísticos que a nadie importan, la migración hacia la capital y hacia Estados Unidos, la tranquilidad de la vida en las afueras de la gran urbe y como ésta sucumbe ante las apariencias.

Todo esto se refleja en los mismos personajes. Mientras Julio, hijo de una secretaria de una empresa transnacional,  se cuida de  prender fósforos en el baño de Tenoch para ahuyentar el mal olor; Tenoch, hijo del Subsecretario de Estado, levanta con el pie la tapa del excusado en casa de Julio.

Cada una de estas pequeñas historias que se desprenden del relato principal nos muestra un pedacito de la cultura mexicana y de las grandes diferencias que existen en su sociedad. Todo esto sucede frente a los personajes quienes, ajenos al mundo, son indiferentes a lo que ocurre ante sus propios ojos.

La película, sorprende, enternece, cuestiona al espectador mientras critica a la sociedad mexicana, por la corrupción de sus autoridades, la injusticia, la desigualdad y la indiferencia. 

Esta es la historia del último viaje de Tenoch, Julio y Luisa juntos. Es el relato del fin de una era, lleno de humor pero con la nostalgia y melancolía que todo final trae consigo.

Headline: South Beach Munchies Café
Subheadline: Yaritza Rivas

&nbsp;
El 324 de la calle Lincoln en South Beach encierra en sí mismo un contraste: el de un lugar que pasa desapercibido por su poca atractiva fachada y de aquel concurrido por aquellos que lo conocen bien. Es el South Beach Munchies Café.

Frente a al mismo es usual ver pasar a quienes vienen desde la playa en sus trajes de baño y sin camisa. Pero en el negocio,  que proclama tener el mejor cuban coffee, se quedan sólo aquellos que por voluntad propia están cómodos con el cartel que dice: "we reserved the right to refuse service to anyone".

A las afueras del Café, sentados en las mesas de plástico están algunos de sus clientes. Trabajadores, estudiantes, pensionados, retirados. Todos hispanos. Algunos van de paso. Otros de prisa. Unos ordenan para llevar el arroz con habichuelas y carne que será su cena. Otros paran, precisamente, por un munchie, un sandwich cubano, un jugo o agua.

"Por qué tiras fotos aquí, en este lugar tan feo. Si allí, en Ocean Drive, 
hay sitios más bonitos", me dice un señor con curiosidad, mientras me señala hacia la playa. "Es que este lugar tiene algo que me llama la atención", respondo.

Allí hay movimiento. Personajes. Todo sucede muy rápido. Entran, ordenan y salen. Pero, ¿quiénes están allí?

"Vi que estabas tomando fotos, y me dicen que usted es periodista", me comenta un señor entrado en años. "Estudiante de periodismo", le dije.  "Es que yo quería saber si usted tiene el número de "Ocurrió Así". "¿Y para qué necesita el número?", le pregunté.

No dio a entender lo que necesitaba, pero se sintió en la libertad de sacar, lo que según él, es la medalla que evidencia su servicio militar en la Segunda Guerra Mundial. "Yo llegué aquí -a Miami- cuando todavía no se hablaba español...", y así comenzó a dar detalles breves de su experiencia en la Guerra. Nació en Honduras y visita el Café a menudo, pues dice, nunca está en su casa.

Tito, dueño del Café, niega que hayan abaleado el negocio hace unas semanas, pero los clientes lo afirman tan pronto éste se voltea. No le cabe más remedio que admitirlo. Entonces, señala los agujeros por donde pasaron las balas.

South Beach Munchies Café, encasillado como un lugar "peligroso" y "feo", contrasta con los detalles humanos de quienes allí se pasan. Dentro del continuo movimiento se refleja indiferencia. Algunos entran con comodidad. Sin embargo, la incomodidad de otros les hace no detenerse. Mientras, afuera se quedan los indigentes que aún "no se ganan el derecho de ser servidos".

Headline: Eduardo Gamarra: &#8220;Los estudiantes latinoamericanos son un subsidio a Estados Unidos&#8221;
Author: Mary Aviles / Zona Editor
&nbsp;
Una noche de 1994, Mark Rosemberg, fundador del Centro Latinoamericano y del Caribe (LACC, por sus siglas en inglés) llamó a Eduardo Gamarra y le dijo: &#8220;Quiero que seas el director del LACC. Tienes 48 horas para decidir&#8221;.

&#8220;Estás loco&#8221;, le respondió Gamarra, cuya experiencia administrativa hasta entonces se reducía a su trabajo con la Conferencia Católica Norteamericana asistiendo a refugiados del Mariel.
&#8220;De haber tenido más tiempo para considerarlo, no hubiera aceptado&#8221;. Así, Eduardo Gamarra describió a FIU Magazine su entrada al LACC. 

Hoy en día el LACC, con Gamarra como director, es un importante centro en el que se reúnen profesores, estudiantes y periodistas de todas partes del mundo interesados en América Latina.

Este profesor, de origen boliviano, llegó a la Universidad a dar clases en 1986, luego de terminar estudios de doctorado en la Universidad de Pittsburg. Vino a Estados Unidos con 17 años y como muchos otros latinoamericanos se convirtió en latino.
&#8220;Todos los días pienso si estaré aportando lo suficiente a mi país. O si hubiera hecho más regresando&#8221;.
Ese, es a juicio de Gamarra, el reto de los estudiantes latinoamericanos. Quedarse y realizarse personalmente, o regresar y participar directamente en la construcción de sus naciones.

&#8220;Los estudiantes que vienen aquí son un subsidio de América Latina a Estados Unidos. Sus países invirtieron en ellos y hay que pensar cómo se devuelve esa inversión&#8221;.
A pesar de esto, Gamarra afirma que si tuviera que hacerlo otra vez, tomaría la misma decisión. 

Dar clases es una pasión para él. Aunque la investigación lo haya alejado de las aulas.
&#8220;Soy muy auto crítico y creo que no he conseguido el balance entre ser profesor e investigador. Sólo doy una clase por semestre y no puedo dedicarle todas las horas que quisiera a los alumnos&#8221;.

Sin embargo, están los Estudios Independientes o  Independent Studies, grupos de estudiantes que asisten al profesor Gamarra en sus investigaciones y participan de otras actividades del LACC.

&#8220;Lo bueno es que aquí no vienen obligados, sino a debatir, con la mente abierta, temas como democratización, economía y exclusión social, entre otros&#8221;.

Gamarra recomienda a los estudiantes leer, pero no sólo de sus países sino de otros lugares. &#8220;Si eres venezolano lee sobre Colombia; si eres colombiano lee sobre Ecuador. Hay que leer sobre lo que no se sabe&#8221;.

Y hablando de lecturas pendientes, Eduardo Gamarra tiene por terminar varios libros, entre ellos uno sobre el Narcotráfico y su relación con Miami y Latinoamérica.  Es una primicia, pero también una promesa.

&nbsp;
FIU baseball continues its woes in conference and  road play, losing two games to Arkansas State this past weekend and dropping to 27-12, 4-8 in the Sun Belt.

ASU 8, FIU 4

Arkansas State (15-19, 5-6 SBC) handed FIU a 8-4 loss Sunday afternoon in the the rubber match of the series against the Indians. It was the seventh loss in nine games for the Golden Panthers and was the first time since 1996 FIU has dropped three consecutive conference series. 

FIU starter Carlos Alvarez was credited with the loss, dropping his record to 1-1 on the season after pitching two innings, allowing four hits and three earned runs. It marked the second straight year the Indians have taken two of three against the Golden Panthers.

The Golden Panthers scored a run in the third on a RBI single by Brad Eldred scoring Alex Suarex to close the lead to 6-1. Alvarez was replaced in the bottom of the third by Michael Baluja. 

FIU rallied in the seventh, scoring a run when Dennis Diaz walked with the bases loaded, but that was the closest the Golden Panthers would get.

ASU 5, FIU 3

FIU lost 5-3 to ASU on Derek Taylor's first start of the year in the second game of the three-game series versus ASU.

FIU struck first in the bottom of the fourth on a two-out solo homerun to left field by Adam Summerell for a 1-0 lead. 

With the bases loaded and no outs, ASU scored one run to tie the score on an error by Alex Ansoleaga.

FIU's Skip Adams cut the Indians' lead to 5-3 in the eighth inning after he lined a solo homerun to left field on a 1-1 pitch for his seventh of the year. 

FIU 15, ASU 1

FIU downed ASU 15-1, ending its three-game SBC losing streak.
Derek DeCarlo improved to 6-0 on the season after pitching seven innings, allowing just six hits and one earned run.

FIU jumped out to a 6-0 lead in the top of the third, scoring five runs on two homeruns. Eldred hit in his fourth consecutive game. 

ASU scored its first run in the eighth as Nate Olson scored from second as pinch hitter Roberson hit a single up the middle.

FIU tallied six runs on two hits and two errors in the ninth to make the final score 15-1.

Baseball Notes

Senior outfielder/ first baseman Hector Peñate quit the team. Luis Gazitua has been out the past two weeks with a strained shoulder. Joshua Banks is expected to return to the mound next week after being out for about five weeks.

Headline: Softball takes 3 of 4 over Aggies
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU softball team's blueprint for winning games this season has been a reliance on small ball offense and strong pitching.  After taking three out of four games against New Mexico State, scoring 27 runs and recording 39 hits, the offensive part of the blueprint may have to be revised.  
  
FIU 6, New Mexico State 0

With starter Kendra Laminack sidetracked by the flu all week, Amanda Nealer came out of the bullpen to shut down New Mexico State (18-30, 1-3 SBC) and lead FIU (34-25, 6-2) to the 6-0 win.

Nealer (11-4) was almost unhittable, allowing two hits over 8.2 innings of relief in the four game series.  She lowered her team-leading ERA to 1.09.

FIU pitching nailed down their 17th shutout of the season.

"[New Mexico State] hadn't seen me before and they seemed a bit anxious up at the plate," Nealer said.  "My curveball was on and I felt good out there today."

"Amanda had a great weekend.  She's so capable of shutting the door out of the 'pen," head coach Kim Gywdir said.  "She's kind of like a closer for us."

Nealer had closer's stuff working this weekend.

"She kept the ball away and wasn't giving them anything decent to hit," catcher Marleah Stapf said.  "Amanda was throwing hard and with her change-up working the hitters were off all day."

Lesley Gillen was not off all day.  She led the Golden Panthers with two hits, one of them a RBI-single to ignite the scoring.

Nicole Dubovik stole her team leading 20th base of the season.

FIU 10, New Mexico State 3

The Golden Panthers must have thought they were playing at Coors Field when they erupted for six runs on six hits in the first inning to propel them to a 10-3 victory over the Aggies.

Jennifer Owens led the way with a 4-4 day and three RBI.  

Owens is tied for the team lead with Kelly Nicosia with 52 hits and drove in her team leading 30th run.

"I was just trying to relax in the box and whatever happens, happens," Owens said.  "We came out trying not to kill the ball and just make contact and the hits fell in."

The hits certainly fell as the Golden Panthers banged out 15 of them.  Kristen Perry, Sabrina Smith and Lindsey Tippings each had two hits to contribute to the hit parade.

Tippings had a season-high four RBI against the Aggies.

"We haven't been hitting as well as we should be, but we've practiced hard," Tippings said.  "We brought our bats out today."

Vanessa Preston (11-8) went 3.2 innings for the win and tied Nealer for the team lead in wins.  Leah Barnes pitched 3.1 innings of relief to pick up her second save of the season.

"The pitching held them really well.  Leah gave a strong performance in relief," Coach Gywdir said.  "Sometimes pitching with a big lead you don't know what to do, but we got the job done on the mound."

New Mexico State 3, FIU 2

The rubber-armed Anita Knight pitched a complete game six-hitter to salvage one win in the four game series for New Mexico State, who won 3-2.  Knight pitched 19 of the possible 23.2 in the weekend series.

Laminack (8-6) started for FIU and was sailing right along until the fourth inning. 

The Aggies started the inningwith consecutive singles by Linzi Wescott and Shayne Gipson and followed it with a three-run home run by Mel Briggs to give them a 3-0 lead.

Laminack allowed another single before being pulled.  Nealer relieved her and pitched four scoreless innings.

"Kendra was on.  She had her inside curve working," catcher Kristen Perry said.  "The home run was on a good outside low curve.  I don't know how she (Briggs) hit it."

The bright spot for FIU came on offense where Perry, who was 2-2, drove a solo homer over the left field fence.  Nicosia also had two hits and raised her team leading batting average to .297.  

"[Knight] wasn't throwing anything but fastballs," Perry said.  "So I kind of knew what to expect going up there."
On the first pitch, she saw Perry deliver a line-drive single into the right field gap.

FIU 9, New Mexico State 1 (5 innings)

Vanessa Preston and the Golden Panthers set the tone for the four game series with a commanding performance in a 9-1 win over New Mexico State.

Preston pitched a one-hitter with six strikeouts and the Golden Panthers pounded out 12 hits to end the game in the fifth inning due to the eight-run rule.

"I've been practicing all week on my curve and rise ball," Preston said.  "I guess they both worked well.  I was really focused."

"Working on those two pitches was the biggest part of the 1-hitter," Coach Gywdir said.

"Vanessa's so good, so confident," Jennifer Owens, 2-4 with a RBI, said.  "She comes out tough against any team."

Stephanie Wolter and Nicole Dubovik were tough to get out. 

Leadoff hitter Wolter was 2-3 with a double and a RBI.  Dubovik, who would go on to steal five bases in the series and got plunked three times, was 2 for 2 with a RBI.

Headline: Laminack emerges in second season
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Webster's dictionary defines a bridge as a structure providing a way across a path.  

For FIU softball, Kendra Laminack is that.

Whenever FIU has needed to cross from a losing to a winning path, Laminack is usually there to provide strong pitching and a win.

Laminack is 4-0 with one save and a 1.13 ERA after an FIU loss.  The team is 7-0 when she pitches after a loss.

Much like a bridge, Laminack has a strong foundation, can carry a heavy load and be intimidating to batters with her size and curveball. 

"My dad always says the word 'can't' is not in your vocabulary," Laminack said.  "I like taking a challenge head on."

Head coach Kim Gwydir has seen the emergence of her sophomore right-hander.

"She takes so much responsibility on her shoulders and she's so smart," Gwydir said.  "I feel the most comfortable putting her in after a loss."

"When I take the mound I only think of softball," Laminack said.  "I just go out there and focus on my location and just try and get the hitters out."

The hitters aren't her only focus at FIU.  She's also focused on bridges, or at least learning how to build one.  Laminack is a civil engineering major.

Laminack hails from Milwaukie, Ore.,  a suburb of Portland.  Unlike the more famous Milwaukee, which is known for its beer, this Milwaukie is known for its bridges.

"I guess I grew up around bridges.  There are a lot of bridges back home," Laminack said.  "I really like science and math.  I think bridges were part of the reason I chose civil engineering, even though I didn't know much about the major when I chose it."

Putting the team on her back after a loss, carrying a full course load of civil engineering classes and dedicating her other free time to softball, finding time to do everything can be a challenge.

"[The combination of] engineering and softball is really difficult, because of the great amount of time each consumes," Laminack said.  "It's not as easy as softball and another subject."

Laminack's teammates admire her determination.

"She has one of the best work ethics I have ever seen," catcher Marleah Stapf said.  "Kendra's so mentally strong and dedicated."

"Kendra is the supreme student-athlete," pitcher Vanessa Preston said.  "She really defines what a student-athlete is all about.  She's getting her education's worth."

Laminack, who maintains a 3.89 GPA, didn't have much spare time growing up in Milwaukie.

Laminack excelled in three sports back in high school; she lettered in softball, basketball and volleyball at Rex Putnam High in Milwaukie.  

She dominated so many games with strikeouts that Laminack was dubbed The Big Unit in high school, after another tall, blond pitcher from the Pacific Northwest at that time, Seattle Mariners pitcher Randy Johnson.

Laminack also has collected as much hardware as her favorite player, Derek Jeter.  

She was First Team League Pitcher, basketball MVP in 1997 and 1998, and volleyball MVP in 1999.

"I guess it runs in the family," Laminack said.  "I started at a young age; plus my dad played four sports and my aunts and uncles were also heavily involved with sports."

Even though the Laminack family sports Mecca resides in Oregon, Laminack had other ideas of where she wanted to play softball.

"I've always wanted to play softball in warm weather," Laminack said.  
"So I decided to try something different and when Coach Gwydir recruited me, I was headed to Miami."

Civil engineering made her stand out in the recruiting process," Gwydir said.  "She wasn't a can't-miss prospect, but she was definitely a positive project."

When Laminack crossed the bridge from Milwaukie to Miami in August of 2000, she wasn't in Oregon anymore.  After all, tall blondes don't exactly grow on trees in Miami.

"My first impression was a cultural shock," Laminack said.  "It's much hotter down here, a lot of crazy drivers running red lights and the laws are much [more stricter] in Milwaukie."

The right-hander also had to deal with a sort of softball shock.
In her freshman year, Laminack didn't get much playing time and wondered if she'd made the right decision coming to FIU.

"I had never sat out in any of the sports I played," Laminack said.  "I had a lot of miserable days and really started to doubt myself and my pitching ability."

"But I had some great teammates that helped me out and were there for me," Laminack added.  "I'm really glad that I didn't give up or quit."
The Golden Panthers are also glad the right-hander didn't quit.

"She didn't do well as a freshman," Gwydir said.  "But she's so intelligent, such a big strong girl and a hard worker that it was just a matter of time before she succeeded."

Succeeded may be an understatement in describing Laminack's ascension.

The right-hander, who wears the number nine and is sometimes called K-9 by her teammates, has defeated two nationally ranked teams this season.

Laminack relieved against No. 11 Florida Atlantic, and she struck out 11 and pitched a complete game, two-hit shutout against No. 14 Iowa.

She is 8-5, leads the team in ERA (1.07), strikeouts (79), innings pitched (124) and is tied for the lead in shutouts (2) and complete games (5).

"Kendra gets a lot of movement with her pitches and has an intimidating presence on the mound," Stapf said.  "She really lives up to "The Big Unit" nickname.  She never fails to amaze me."

"In this game you're either confident or not," right-fielder Kelly Nicosia said.  "Kendra's mentally tough and dominating.  She's carried this team."

Two years from now, when Laminack graduates, she may be crossing the bridge back from Miami to Milwaukie.

An avid snowboarder, Laminack misses the snow and mountains of home.  Along with tap dancing and jazz, snowboarding was one of her hobbies growing up.  

"It's something I picked up in high school," Laminack said.  "I love it.  I just go and have fun in the snow and the mountains."

She eventually would like to move back to Oregon and sees herself involved in some kind of work with bridges.

But she'll cross that bridge when she gets to it.

"Right now we're just focused on winning our conference and trying to make Regionals," Laminack said.

The Golden Panthers know the path to the post-season is a little smoother now that they have a sturdy five-foot ten bridge to get them there.

"Kendra's a leader who will give us big contributions," Stapf said.  "She's one of the underclassmen [whom] everyone looks up to."

Headline: Defense Dominates Blue/Gold Scrimmage
Author: Mike Hernandez, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Behind Chris Horne's five tackles and two sacks, the Golden Panther defense redeemed itself for last week's "embarrassment" by dominating the offense 39-7 in front of an estimated crowd of 500. 

Kyle Salas, Jeff Wilson and John Haritan each had five tackles in the 60-play scrimmage. Additionally, James Knapp and Nick Turnbull both had an interception to lead the defense. 

"We came out this week and played hard" Horne said. "Last week we got embarrassed." 

Freshmen quarterbacks David Tabor and Joe Fleming split time under center. 

Tabor started the contest. His longest pass was a 34-yard connection with receiver Harold Leath. That was the lone bright spot in the first half for Tabor as he threw two interceptions and was unable to move the offense downfield. 

Fleming was pressured all afternoon. He was sacked a total of four times and threw for 33 yards. Tabor and Fleming combined for 167 yards, completing 17 passes. Tabor threw for the majority of the yardage, finishing with 134 for the game. 

"The defense got embarrassed last week and they came out ready to play today" head coach Don Strock said. "The offense figured we have their number, so we'll just take it easy." 

The defense led 21-0 at the half. 

In the beginning of the second half, the offense looked as if it would put up a fight. Running back Gerrid Lundstedt picked up 33 yards on five carries while Tabor was once again at the helm of the offense.  

The offense manuevered its way down to the 1-yard line before Tabor fumbled twice. The second was recovered by Defensive Lineman Pedro Farias, stalling the drive. 

The offense got on the board in the second half, after being stopped on its first eight attempts, when Tabor connected with Julius Eppinger for a 10-yard touchdown for what proved to be the lone offensive score. 

Eppinger finished the game with 41 yards receiving and a touchdown. Edwin Pierre finished with a team-high 42 yards.

"We told [the players], the defense can't take one week off and the offense takes off the next," Strock said. 

"That's how you get beat. We're working with both groups for consistency. But a lot of good things happened out here today and the effort was there on both sides." 

Running Back Tori Robinson came back from an irregular heartbeat that had him miss nearly the entire spring. He had eight carries for 38 yards. 

For the second consecutive week, a special teams player stood out. 

Punter James Carraway's six punts went for 295 yards, averaging 49.2 yards per kick. 

That total included a 68 yard kick.

Headline: Law fraternity returns after three year hiatus
Author: Daniella Bonilla / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
By Daniella Bonilla
Contributing Writer

After a three year hiatus, the Phi Alpha Delta law fraternity once again began to breathe new life when 24 new members were inducted. The rebirth of this fraternity was a result of the concern and question of present law student and Phi Alpha Delta President Francesca Cesti.

"I noticed that there were lots of misinformed prospective law students, as well as myself," Cesti said. 
"This fraternity is a type of network that will unite students with the same interests and provide the essential tools to help them make [educated] decisions about the law field."

Phi Alpha Delta had originally been chartered three years ago, but went dormant as those members involved became inactive. In trying to bring the fraternity back, the first initial question was whether or not the group would continue to be a student organization, or be affiliated with a national fraternity.

"We are hoping that the structure of this fraternity will bring ongoing classes into the organization," political science professor and Phi Alpha Delta advisor Dr. Rebecca Salokar said. "There is a much better promise now."

"It is a professional fraternity," Salokar said. " Clearly some of the fraternity traditions are practiced and passed on, but also present in this fraternity, is the notion of having a professional growth experience."

The fraternity consists of an executive board with a president, vice president, secretary and treasurer. Alongside the executive board, the first Phi Alpha Delta class has committee chairs as well.

The structure and agenda of the Phi Alpha Delta fraternity, consists of developed networking, internship experiences, preparation for the LSAT and making sure all proper course work is received. Volunteer work is also important to the fraternity.     

"Our goal is to give the members within this fraternity the knowledge necessary to pursue a career in law, while giving back to the community," Cesti said.

"It's all about the unity," Cesti said. "It's through its members that carry out its [the fraternity's] functions and allow it to become a strong organization."

 There is no academic requirement to join Phi Alpha Delta because this fraternity does not believe in academic discrimination.
However, criterion for initiation "focuses on the quality of a person," Cesti said.

"We look at the goals that they have for themselves and those they would have for the betterment of the organization," she said.
Despite the fraternity's youth, many activities and projects are already being designed and implemented.

Representatives from two major testing companies – Kaplan and Princeton – have spoken to the group, and programs working within the community and education system have been up for discussion and possible further action.

One of these programs, include "Guardian Ad Litem," which is a stationed program, run through the courts, where volunteers are trained to represent children in the state legal system. Phi Alpha Delta is working at making connections and formal arrangements with those heading this community project, to participate in its cause.

Phi Alpha Delta will also try to represent FIU students as well.

"The fraternity is also interested in working in student affairs, in the form of serving as advisors to students who are charged with academic and student conduct violations," Salokar said. 

In becoming and establishing this type of student advocacy group, those members of Phi Alpha Delta would act as a core of knowledgeable counsel, who could be contacted by students in need of help and basic, legal advice, to pursue and present their cases. 

"Students need to have an advisor that is familiar with the process," Salokar said.  "They need someone who can spend the time to develop their cases and defense, so that the proper assessment of due process and administrative hearings are rightly provided."

The fraternity hopes to establish their student advocate program as soon as student government elections are over, so that the new student government officials will be able to proceed in the development of this program.

"We are planning on being active during the summer, by having our first 'recruitment,'" Cesti said. "Recruitment is the equivalent of what many fraternities consider to be the act of 'rushing' or trying to get other persons to join or become affiliated with their fraternity."

"Basically, we are just really trying to get recognized," Cesti said.

Headline: Sociology professor publishes, edits five books, fights cancer
Author: Sheaon Reid / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Dr. Abraham D. Lavender is Jewish with roots in South Carolina. His mixed family ancestry dates back as far as the 1690s in Charleston. He doesn't consider himself a traditional Jew but attends and participates in special events such as a Seder, a tradition in recognition of Passover.

Even though he identifies himself as Jewish, he is open-minded and accepting of other religions. According to Lavender, "Before identifying yourself as Jewish or anything else, you should first be a human."

He is a man who has been greatly influenced by Eastern philosophy.  Lavender strongly believes, "No one promises a perfect life, so do whatever you can to overcome bad things and always remember other people have been through worse things and realize how lucky we are."
Lavender earned his bachelor and master's degrees at the University of South Carolina, and in 1972 received his doctorate degree in sociology at the University of Maryland. 

He has been teaching for over 25 years and has been a sociology professor at FIU for almost 12.

Lavender is proud to say that among his accomplishments, he has published five books, including "Jewish Farmers of the Catskills: A Century of Survival" in 1995 with Clarence Steinberg and "French Huguenots: From Mediterranean Catholics to White Anglo-Saxon Protestants" in1990, and written over 40 scholarly articles. In addition he conducts lectures in the community. 

He settled at FIU in 1986, because it was a growing university filled with diversity and had a good sociology department, he said.
In September of 2000 Lavender was diagnosed with melanoma, a form of cancer.

Thanks to his training in Eastern philosophy, he never asked the question, "Why me?" Instead, he asked, "Why not me?" He said he is no different from anyone else.

One's attitude is very important, he said a reminder that one should do the best with whatever card one is dealt. 

After an operation in October of 2000 he started cancer treatment. It took 12 months, and after the treatment he still had to go through months of recovery from its side effects.

He took a medical leave during the treatment period and informed his students of his situation. 

"I felt my students had a right to know what was going on," said Lavender. 

Graduate student Brian Abramson has known Lavender for almost 10 years. He describes him as an interesting character, very funny, a very good teacher who is very intelligent and knowledgeable in his field. Abramson said he recommends Lavender to any student who wants to take a sociology course.

The cancer has not dampened Lavender's spirits. He said the help of his mother and his strong beliefs in philosophy have helped him deal with the disease. 

He has accepted cancer as part of his life. But it is far from being his whole life.

Lavender says he likes to spend his spare time reading books pertaining to sociology are preferred. 

He has traveled to many countries such as Italy, France, Greece, England and Turkey and Israel as well as cities such as Las Vegas, Seattle, New Orleans, St. Louis and Washington, D.C. 

He's not done though. "I want to go to a lot of other places when I retire," Lavender said. "There is nothing like traveling with a good book." 
In spite of his 25 years of being a professor, there was a point in Lavender's life when he wanted to become a lawyer and eventually get involved in politics. But he didn't persue it.

 "It was during the '60s in South Carolina during racial segregation that I realized that I was too liberal to become a lawyer and politician," said Lavender. "I felt my views would clash too much with politics."
Lavender has no regrets about his decision. He says he finds his profession quite rewarding.

 "The most rewarding experience for me as a professor is when students come back and tell me what an impact I made in their lives."

English department professor Tometro Hopkins has been a colleague of Lavender's for approximately 10 years and says he is a great person and friend.

"He is very supportive and I enjoy working with him," Hopkins said
As a professor, he describes himself to be "a sociologist and hopefully a nice guy. I am very open-minded and believe there is truth in both sides of the story."

Lavender feels there is not enough discussion on the topic of cancer and feels that because of this people are not receiving the support and advice they deserve while going through the disease.

"With more discussion, people will be aware of how many people are affected," he said. "[They] will be better able to give support, and hopefully will be more likely to have themselves checked."

The future is usually uncertain with cancer. You can almost never be completely sure that it is gone, but Lavender keeps a positive view of life. 

"There are more things in life; don't dwell on petty stuff, Lavender said."	
"I feel very optimistic about his recovery," Abramson said. "He is a very strong person and I believe he will beat it." 

Professor Hopkins feels the same way.

"As a friend I was devastated to hear the news," she said. "But I feel very optimistic he will pull through because he is a strong person and in addition he is very open about it which I think is a healing process for him."

 "I have taken the necessary steps such as staying on the medication," Lavender said, "and I will continue to take the necessary steps."

Subheadline: Jackie plays fair, Hans plays fowl
Author: Hans and Jackie
&nbsp;
Q: What am I in the mood for lunch today?
Curious Moron

H: The entrée is love, with a large dish of venereal disease on the side, baby.
J: Expired breadcrumbs and dead bird remains with toasted monkey brains on the side, all washed down with a bottle of Chianti.  

Q: Why is soccer the fifth most important sport in the U.S.?
SoccerChick

H: Because it goes right after splurge, lunge-shooting, bricketball, poker, and hammock throw: just where God intended it to be.
J: Because it won't change one bit. Besides God only plays football. Isn't it time for a change of heart?

Q: Why is it okay for people to say, "I don't care if he's gay, just as long as he doesn't hit on me!" while it is NOT okay for people to say, "I don't care if she's Hispanic, just as long as she doesn't show it! God, Spanish is SUCH a stupid language!" or "I don't care if he's black, just as long as he stays away from my car!"? Why is it okay to hate certain people, yet not okay to hate others? I don't get it! Why can't we all hate each other equally?! After all, this is America, dammit!
Uber-Vanish

H: I don't know. I'm mostly a lover, not a hater, so I gotta parcel out my hatred efficiently. For instance, I can't stand those people in class who're always asking questions and trying to learn. They're missing the point of college entirely.
 J: Damn, there are haters like you everywhere! The chances of you changing the way things are in America are slim to none.  I advice you to take some valium and listen to "It's a Small World After All" over and over until your head explodes and then maybe I can sympathize. 

Q: Is consumerism considered an ailment worthy of a tax write-off by the IRS? After getting a few hefty paychecks, I've been forced to randomly slide my Visa Gold check card to pay for things like guitars, amps, clothing, cologne, sun glasses and "Buffy" comic books. Is there any hope of redemption? Or will I at least get some money back from our corrupt Dubya government?
Xander Van Rook

H: Join Shopaholics Anonymous, have a public breakdown, and sue UPN for tempting you and causing you such great distress.
J: Unfortunately Xander, the IRS doesn't care about your consumer needs. Oh, and your love for "Buffy, The Vampire Slayer," of course. It only cares that they get their "dinero" (or should I say yours). And of course, your money will go to give a prisoner a better TV set so he too can enjoy an all new "Buffy".

Q: Why was that bird at the apartments attacking me all week long?
Hitchcock

J: Well, birds are fond of your newly bleached hair color.  It produces a sex hormone that makes them very aggressive. The solution is to dye your hair back to its original color. Didn't Tippi Hedren have blonde hair?
H: Also, I hear Gus Van Sant is remaking "The Birds" shot by shot, except this time around the birds curse and masturbate loudly.

Headline: Great cast makes for memorable "Glengarry"
Author: Alfred Soto/ Editorial Advisor
&nbsp;
It's one thing to write profanities, and quite another to write about the source of obscenity. David Mamet's "Glengarry Glen Ross" shows what happens when men confuse machismo with career satisfaction, until their contempt for their jobs, coworkers, managers and finally themselves, splutters into obscenity for its own sake. 

Continuing its fine tradition of staging difficult classics of the theatre repertoire, the FIU Theatre Department really had its work cut out in tackling Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Although the original 1984 production featured a legendary performance by Joe Mantegna as hotshot salesman Ricky Roma, most people know the 1992 film version directed by James Foley instead. Its powerhouse cast of American actors (Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, a slender Kevin Spacey), who attacked their parts with a glee that can only be described as murderous, was one of the best assembled in a contemporary American movie.

It's almost impossible to watch this production and forget who played who in the film version, which really does a great disservice to the very talented cast and to Wayne E. Robinson's brisk direction. The actors approach the material almost as an exercise. They must have known that not only have Mamet's gutter argot and oddball rhythms been imitated to the point of parody (more in film than in theatre; see the Coen brothers and Quentin Tarantino), but that the actors' own desire to just screw the movie and get their parts right mirrors how Mamet's salesmen claw at each other to get their names on the blackboard. This approach works. 

Shelley "The Machine" Levene (Ricky Waugh) has seen better days. Once a top salesman, he's since degenerated into a lumpy, self-pitying sad sack, a wheedler, a guy who's forever pitching something, whether it's property, his terminally ill daughter or his own loser status. He envies the success of Ricky Roma (Joe Llorens), a flashy loudmouth who's honed selling into an art as suave and ingratiating as the perfect come-on (the play doesn't hide its sexual subtexts). Mid-level salesmen George Aaronow (Meshawn Arnold) and Dave Moss (Danny Suarez ) bicker endlessly between themselves, like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in dark jackets. Overseeing them is Williamson (Ivan Lopez), a bureaucrat who makes colorlessness a sort of profanity. 

It's very gratifying to find out that Mamet's vulgarities weren't edited out. Wholesome family entertainment this ain't. From Roma's hilarious riff on foreplay ("the great f---- of your life…whaddya remember about them?") to Levene's detailed explanation of how he conned a crazy couple into signing for premium property, this is some of the best dialogue ever written for an American play. Mamet's salesmen scheme because, when nothing's going your way, that's all they know how to do. They curse violently, loudly, colorfully, even lovingly.

The cast does a nifty job of rubbing itself in Mamet's sewer water. Waugh is very good at focusing. He doesn't forget that Levene is, in the end, a pathetic figure; you're not supposed to feel sorry for him when he gets his comeuppance. Levene is a schlep, one step up from hawking used cars in a chicken suit. Llorens also shines, despite lapsing uncomfortably close to Al Pacino shtick (when he yelled what sounded like "Whoo-ah!" he threw everyone in the audience out of the play). 

At a time when presidents don't even go through the effort of hiding to what corporate interests they answer, this staging of "Glengarry Glen Ross" for a young, eager crowd feels right. While I'm not naïve enough to disagree with the adage that the business of America is business, I'm also not jaded enough to think that we should nod politely and accept it. At the very least we can wave a middle finger at any interest that encourages screwing other people over because that's what a good capitalist does.

Headline: "Van Wilder" passes comedy test
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
Normally, when people think of college, they envision an institute of higher learning where you go to get the highest form of education before finding your place in "the real world."

Unless of course you're thinking with the mind of the National Lampoon crew, in which case the only high thing is you. That, combined with the help of director Walt Becker ("Buying the Cow"), will get you "National Lampoon's Van Wilder," the most hilarious comedy of the year. What National Lampoon did for college with "Animal House" in 1978, they do once again with "Van Wilder" for the twenty-first century. This film is loaded with every type of offensive material there is. There's drug content, vulgarity and, my personal favorite, nudity.

Welcome to Coolidge College, one of the finest institutions in America. The teachers are eager to teach, and of course all the students are eager to learn. Correction, all the students minus one, the so-called "King of College," Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds). Wilder has been attending Coolidge for the last seven years. Apparently he's got himself a plan: to stay at college, live off the money his extremely wealthy dad sends him, hold back graduation indefinitely, and throw the best parties on campus for all the students, all the time. Van Wilder believes his life can't get any better. 

Of course, that's not to say it can't get worse. His wealthy dad Vance Wilder Sr. (Tim Matheson from "Animal House") receives from him yet another request for money. Vance goes to Coolidge personally and confronts him. Van is forced to find a way to pay for college himself. That's where his popularity comes in handy.

The editor in chief of the school newspaper has decided to do an exposé on him. For this task, he calls upon his favorite reporter, the talented, beautiful and stuffy Gwen Pearson (Tara Reid). At first she is reluctant to take on this assignment because she doesn't think there's a story, but she learns more about him than she bargained for. In her article, she refers to him as a "party liaison." And if you thought he was popular before, then this will guarantee a statue of him erected in front of the school. 

He soon becomes quite the entrepreneur with the help of both his long-time friend Hutch (Teck from "The Real World") and his new assistant Taj (Kal Penn). Van Wilder seems to have everything he's ever wanted, but what he really wants now is to win Gwen's heart.
The longer you watch it, the more "National Lampoon's Van Wilder" seems like a sequel to "Animal House." Even though the 1978 classic had a better plot, Van Wilder is just as funny. Ryan Reynolds seems to fit the role perfectly. His charismatic party-on attitude looks like something out of a Jim Carrey movie. There's even a special appearance by Erik Estrada and Curtis Armstrong from the "Revenge of the Nerds" movies. The plot ensures plenty of laughs from the audience, especially the "pastry" scene, which you have to see to believe.

Headline: "Sweetest Things" displays Diaz's charms
Author: Daniele Bienfeld
&nbsp;
Is Cameron Diaz in love with herself, or is it just me? "The Sweetest Thing" is a movie about Cameron: how she flirts, seduces, and shakes her booty on the dance floor, wearing sexy outfits that show off her trade mark lower back, making her feminine curve hard to miss, and…

OK, you get the point. I do not approve of her as a role model, because simply put, she isn't one, but  she is able to pull it all off quite well with her barely credible body and her silky hair that falls over her shoulders throughout the movie.  It's a flick for girls who not only like Cameron, but love the night club scene and who like to reveal their sexiness. Oh, and did I mention that this is a film for men, too? Why? Because the scenes are really funny. Really, they are.

But this film also appeals to the minority who do not dress in skimpy outfits, and for those men who do not worship Diaz, or to be more accurate, those men who don't worship Diaz's body.  If at all possible to look past the sexiness, the movie happens to be extremely funny and entertaining. It's about three women who are the best of friends and who love to just have a great time. It's almost like they are just doing their "girl" thing and we happen to be watching. They love to dance everywhere they go, make innocent and ingenuous fun of each other. But no matter what, they are always true to one another. 

In many ways, "The Sweetest Thing" reminds me of "There's Something About Mary." In both of them Diaz takes over the screen. But "There's Something About Mary" is more crude and less funny, while "The Sweetest Thing" is hysterical and less crude. Many of the lines make everyone in the theatre shout out with laughter, thanks to the director, Roger Kumble, whose perfect comic timing saves the day.

But I could definitely see some feminist group becoming angry after watching some of the scenes, such as the one in which Christina (Diaz) and her best friend, Courtney (Christina Applegate), pull over to the side of the road and get out of their sopping-wet clothes, wearing only their underwear, and start dancing, or more like flopping, to "The Piña Colada Song." Who is Kumble kidding? Again, he gives Diaz the opportunity to show off not only her body, but her stars-and-stripes bra. No one ever said this is a movie about self-respect. But they are definitely having a blast.

What is funny is the situation that leads them to be drenched with water, or the scene where the third roommate (Selma Blair) brings her "stained" dress to the dry cleaner. 

Getting distracted by all the laughter, it's easy to forget that the flick is centered around a rather forced romantic situation. Although she typically plays with her men by getting them really fired up and shaking her booty on the dance-floor, she ends up giving them her number, which is always fake. So we get the message: Cameron Diaz isn't ditzy and she is not easy – she's just a tease. One guy is so excited to call her and instead of hearing it ring on the other end, he hears, "Hello, and welcome to movie phone." 

When she finally meets a genuinely cute and funny guy at a club, Peter (Thomas Jane), she believes that he is the man of her dreams (no one ever said this was a realistic flick).
 
Our heroine ends up chasing him throughout the rest of the movie, only to find out that he is getting married. Warning: In real life, we would call this stalking. 

The denouement will surprise no one. It's predictable, sure, but the movie is funny enough to cover up the sappiness. Overall, it's a great comedy; definitely worthwhile.

Headline: Redundant "Gutterflower" withers
Author: Amanda Healy
&nbsp;
More of the same. This is a perfect description of the Goo Goo Dolls' new album, Gutterflower. The twelve tracks on the album could have been taken from any of the Goo Goo Dolls' previous releases. 

This is not necessarily a bad thing, though. For Goo Goo fans, the new album is a pleasant continuation of the music that defines Googooism: easy-listening guitar chords paired with throaty singing and angst-ridden love lyrics. 

It works; it really does. But the problem is if you hear one track, you've basically heard the whole album. Unless you read the lyrics. The lyrics are a different story.

Each song is like a poem. The band would have you believe that its lyrics can stand on their own without music. It seems that the majority of effort was put into the songwriting. 

It is almost a given that the first single will be "Here is Gone," already being publicized more than the other tracks.

"I thought I lost you somewhere/But you were never really there at all," is a typical Goo Goo Doll lyric. They are all marked by way-too-obvious attempts at profondity, but are somehow still endearing. It is blatantly apparent that the Goo Goo Dolls are overreaching with their writing, but their techniques are selling, so they must be striking a chord. A personal favorite is "Big Machine." It is the epitome of the love-angst situation that the Goo Goo Dolls personify with their music. For anyone who feels that love is 75 percent torture, 25 percent elation, this song is your anthem, (It is just burning with passion – positive and negative.) 

"Still in love with all your sins/Where you stop and I begin/And I'll be waiting" demonstrates how this song gives the reasons everyone searches for as to why people strive to fall in love, over and over again, when only once or twice out of countless failures will the jump be successful. It is safe to say that someone in this group has been there.
Lyrics can only go so far, however. After all, this is a rock album – not a book of poetry. If only the Goo Goo Dolls would have put the time spent in writing toward music composition as well. It seems they have a formula for tunes that has been working for them, and, like a recipe, they use it and reuse it and reuse it. Now it just may be getting stale – eat something too often and you'll eventually get tired of it.

 It is for this reason that Gutterflower lacks a lot of zest – the extra bit of spice needed to push them over the top.  There are some things going for them, however, and maybe this time they'll be saved yet again. 
The music is not terrible – it is actually nice to listen to – it just becomes awfully repetitive after a while; but maybe people won't mind using it  as background. Also, if the Goo Goo Dolls' previous fan-base is loyal enough, they can still come out near the top. 

The album is not flop material; it just needs something more to rise above the scores of other albums out there in radio land. The life is all in the words of the songs and this could be enough to doom the Dolls to mediocrity.
