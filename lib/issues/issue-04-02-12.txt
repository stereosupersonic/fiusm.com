Headline: Television networks need to loosen up
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
It all began with a kiss. 

The world buzzed while Madonna, Britney Speares and the kiss that launched a thousand ships was replayed over and over again on news stations, print publications and, of course, the internet. MTV struck gold again using the age-old shock-and-rock technique its perfected throughout the 20 years or so of its influence on culture and the media.

It's nothing we haven't seen before, but the world teems with a furious fervor over a mediocre awards show with music so bad it has to be supplemented with a boring, two-second kiss. Well, two kisses to be exact. Let's not forget about poor Christina Aguilera.

We live in a society where all the popular media and culture we inhale suffers from Attention Deficit Dissorder. Thus, we have the superbowl half time show and another feeble attempt at trying to awe the world by poking at the outer limits of censorship. 

Janet Jackson's split-second breast exposure once again threw the world into a ridiculous buzz - and they say it was purely unintentional. Yeah right, that's a ploy if I ever saw one. In fact, I spent the entire evening wondering what stunt they would pull off during the half-time show; I knew they were going to try and replay the MTV Video Awards stunt. Sure enough, they did.

It's safe to say that the media has figured out the value of sex. We silly humans can never get enough of it, especially when it goes on public television. The media force feeds us shock by teetering on the fine lines of cesnorship rules. It almost makes me wonder if the Federal Communications Commission is in on this somehow. Is it possible the FCC keeps us so puritanical that when the unlikely event of a homoerotic kiss or a flash of breast appears on television, we go psycho-bezerker? Without the rules or codes or violations, perhaps the shock value would go away and the networks would have to find something else to amuse us with. 

I always say it's only a matter of time before these reality TV shows start actually killing off their own contestants. The reality of "The Running Man" is just around the corner.

I may be jumping the gun though, sex is what's in and it's definitely here to stay for a while. If only we knew how silly we looked, drooling over these things that aren't even that sexy. I still don't know how we are so enthralled by a little kiss, or a flash of Miss Jackson's boob (one could hardly tell either, I didn't really realize it at first). In all probability, it ties back to the rules and regulations which maintain our minds in the 1930s Hayes code mentality. Although we may have progressed from married couples having to sleep in seperate beds and we allow the exposure of belly buttons, TV culture is still more or less very Neanderthal.

Progress can only be achieved by letting go. I dare say the recent events and actions described here are progressive, but I do appreciate the testing of deep waters. A craze can be expected at first, but as the mystique dies down in the years that follow, I hope to see a loosening of belts, so to speak, in terms of censorship in the media. 

I call for a complete casting off of clothing. Everbody get naked! We live in the 21st century, Europe does it and damnit, I think we can be sexier than those guys.

Someone tell the President I have a new campaign for him. Rally up the country's pride and unity in nudity. We have nothing to hide and nothing to lose.

Headline: Recent films reinvent sex
Author: Hansel Castro / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Sex is, by far, the wackiest, most consuming activity human beings routinely engage in. You need two individuals, sometimes even three, and they have to agree to shed their clothes and their inhibitions and to act enthusiastic about fluid-swapping activities that, in the cold light of reason, sound about as much fun as an autopsy.

Throw in a camera, and things get really complicated.

Which is why we at The Beacon searched high and low to compile a list of recent hot movies to satisfy all your Valentine's Day renting needs. The most surprising thing about this was how few movies actually have any hot scenes at all. 

I'm not talking about gratuituos breast shots. That stuff's for kids and belongs in the Super Bowl halftime show.

I'm talking about those raw, naked emotions the Motion Picture Association of America doesn't want us to think about. (Not that it's ever stopped us).

The following movies, more or less successfully, dove daringly into the pool of human experience, splashed in the waters of sexual discovery, and left many of us in the audience wet. With wisdom, naturally.

"Y Tu Mama Tambien"

Alfonso Cuaron's coming-of-age road movie has so many steamy moments that it's hard to choose just one. 

There's that opening scene and the car scene, and the pool scene, and the motel scene, and the OTHER motel scene... but beneath it all is a wise, nostalgic understanding of what it means to set out for a heavenly destination that one knows isn't there at all.

"Mulholland Drive" 

There are about as many explanations for the events of David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive" as there are JFK assassination theories. It doesn't matter what happens in the movie, as long as you remember that Naomi Watts is in it, and that she's very, very good, and that when she and Laura Harring collide at a pivotal point in the movie, you forgive David Lynch for giving you such a headache.

"Secretary" 

 On paper, "Secretary" sounds like bad porn: Maggie Gyllenhall has been bad, and she needs a good spanking from her boss, James Spader. On the screen, what could have been just plain embarrassing turns into a deliriously wonderful S and M romance. 

It's truly heartwarming, because it lets you know that, no matter how much of a freak you are, someone even freakier wants to get it on with you.

"Unfaithful" 

Diane Lane is one of the most underrated actresses of our time, in no small measure beacuse of her not-always-wise role decisions. "Unfaithful" is not a particularly good movie. From its pulpy title to the high-handed moralizing, the movie is nowhere near as provocative as it thinks it is. But when Lane turns her shine on, you know it's worth the admission price. If you can forget that Richard Gere is in it as well.

"El Sexo y Lucia" 

Some things need little or no translation. This Spanish import has enough sex appeal to keep you wading through a plot that is nebulous at best. 

The charming determination of its characters, out to find out what sex is really all about, (and making some not-so-pleasant discoveries along the way), will have you saying: "Caliente!" Or whatever other silly Spanish word you learned from the Taco Bell menu.

Headline: Make Valentine's Day meaningful this year
Author: Angela Balinbin/The Seattle Times
&nbsp;
"I'll never let go, Jack. I'll neeeever let goooo!"

OK, fine. I'll admit it. As Kate Winslet uttered those Oscar-winning words, I sniffled. Really, though, any girl would get Titanic-ly teary at the thought of Leonardo DiCaprio's frozen carcass drifting away. How heart-wrenching. Romantic. Emotional. Yes, this is what our culture calls a "love story."

Ahem, but in describing the genre correctly, I wouldn't call "Titanic" a love story. It's a romance. Or a story about love. 

What's the difference? Love, real love, itself, isn't supposed to be simply a story. It's supposed to be the most real thing we know. 

And lucky ducks that we are, our society has its very own holiday to celebrate the big "L" word. At least, it thinks it does. 

But does our modern Valentine's Day really celebrate love? Or just a titanic bombardment of emotional mushy-gushyness? 

Clearly, it's the latter. Once Christmas is over, up go the pink and red hearts, and people start grumbling that marketers push holidays too early on us, that Valentine's Day was only invented by Hallmark, and that not having a Valentine is one February-cold self-esteem killer. 

Wow. Feel the love. 

Our modern Valentine's Day is curly-cued around romance, and having that "special someone" _ unless, of course, you're in grade school, and in that case you have to give a Valentine to everyone, yes, everyone! 

This holiday, then, necessarily excludes all who aren't currently jivin' with romantic love. 

This is wrong! Refuse to put up with this discrimination! Valentine's Day should be about real love, upper-case-L "Love," and not simply romance. 

Can we maybe try to not grumble about Valentine's Day? Can we maybe realize that this is a day when we get to tell the people we care about that we love them? Because doing so is important. 

Even more important is realizing that love doesn't correspond with our pleasure/pain society. Real love isn't about instant gratification, and doesn't work with the "if-it-doesn't-feel-good-then-something's-wrong" rationality. 

Isn't it true that we can be our most brutal and the least patient with those we say we love? Aren't we the quickest to judge and often the slowest to listen to those we say are most important to us? 

Loving isn't a pretty and perfect science that can be summed up on a happy candy heart. Loving means surrendering to the unknown. It's accepting the uncontrollable vulnerability of possibly feeling pain, as well as perhaps the even scarier vulnerability of letting the guard down and allowing ourselves to be loved. 

We are all born into that tension and vulnerability. As an adult now, I choose to live in that vulnerability. I want to be "in love" with the people I surround myself with and things I find myself doing and studying and hoping for. 

Rebuking the opportunity to do so would render my life the same as our modern Valentine's Day: all sickly, sweet fluff and no substance. 

We are pre-disposed to love. You can't convince me otherwise. It's all that we're supposed to do with our lives. It's all that gives our lives meaning. 

So... shouldn't we celebrate this word, this outpouring action verb? 
I say we should. And you know what? Feb. 14 seems like a great day to do it.

Headline: Cream of the crop
Subheadline: The Beacon takes a look at the top five most attractive men in professional sports today.
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
1. Tom Brady - New England Patriots (NFL), Quarterback

There's not too much that women can't already see for themselves about star quarterback Tom Brady. He tops the list as my No. 1 sexiest male athlete. After supplanting longtime Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe in 2001, the 27-year-old Brady soon developed into a two-time Super Bowl champion and two-time Super Bowl MVP after becoming the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl back in 2002. And the 6-foot-4-inch, 225-pound right-handed heartthrob from California is still a bachelor. I repeat, still a bachelor.

2. Carmelo Anthony - Denver Nuggets (NBA), Forward

Carmelo "Melo" Anthony is not far behind Brady on my list. The 20-year-old phenom is already a millionaire, has a website dedicated to him (www.carmeloanthony.net), and still he isn't even old enough to have a beer. Anthony led the Syracuse Orangemen to a 30-5 record in 2003 and to its first NCAA championship, and later became the third overall selection in the 2003 NBA Draft. Famous for an orange sweat band over his neck-long corn rolls, "Melo" averages nearly 19 points and six rebounds for the Denver Nuggets. This smooth, 6-foot-8-inch, 220-pound forward who wears No. 15, is hopeful he can win Rookie of The Year award in 2004, and oh yea, could use a girlfriend.

3. David Beckham - Real Madrid (International Soccer), Midfielder

Twenty-nine-year-old blond bombshell David Beckham comes next.  He doesn't only represent the male species with hot new hair styles, as well as his ability to keep his body in top shape, but he also has been a soccer phenomenon since age 11. Born in London, but now residing in Spain, Beckham is a star mid-fielder for Real Madrid, arguably the most talented club in the world. But watch out ladies, Beckham married Victoria Adams of the Spice Girls in 1999 and became a father of two boys, Brooklyn and Romeo.  Wearing No. 23 and standing 5'11", Beckham has scored.

4. Miguel Cabrera - Florida Marlins (MLB), Left Field

Still keeping them young but talented, 20-year-old World Series champ Miguel Cabrera is fourth on the list. The right-hander from Venezuela has been a hot item in the Major Leagues since first appearing for the Marlins last year. Batting .268 with 12 homeruns in only 87 games after getting called up midseason, Cabrera is one of the players the Marlins are counting on for the future. And the 6-foot-2-inch, 185-pound local hottie is an easy fish to catch - the Marlins' season opener is on March 7 against the Baltimore Orioles.

5. Andy Roddick - USA Tennis

Young and still local, tennis star Andy Roddick from Boca Raton rounds out the list. The right-hander, who turned pro in 2000, has a website celebrating his success (www.andyroddick.com.) This past year, the cute burnet won the 2003 U.S. Open, his first major championship. The 6-foot-2-inch star is currently the No. 1 ranked U.S. player, but unfortunately is also  dating singer and actress Mandy Moore.

Headline: Women's soccer needs to realize sex sells, even in sports
Author: Nasser Khalil/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA (world soccer's governing body), made international sporting headlines just weeks ago when he said the women's game could attract more sponsors if they used "more feminine uniforms" and wore "tighter shorts."

Needless to say, a bevy of anti-Blatter sentiment ensued. Writers from all four corners of the earth came out of the woodworks to partake in the Blatter bashing. Many journalists branded the head of the world's most flourishing game as an idiot, a sexist and just plain ignorant. 

But the reaction to Blatter's comments, although overwhelming, failed to be unanimous. 

There were some, although quiet at first, who saw another side to the comments and the pure truth in them.

Linda Robertson, a sports writer for The Miami Herald, defended Blatter's comments saying that "sex sells" and implied that other women's leagues should adopt that principle to increase ratings.

Julie Foudy, captain of the U.S. women's soccer team, wasn't as understanding however, saying: "Instead of talking about tight shorts, FIFA should be focusing on increasing its support for the women's game by instituting another world championship for youth women, pushing federations around the world to support their women's programs, or giving prize money to teams in the Women's World Cup. We'll start wearing tighter shorts when [Blatter] starts doing press conferences in his bathing suit.''

While Foudy has valid points, she does not understand the reality of Blatter's comments.

Call me crazy, but I don't think you come to be the head of the world's most popular sport by being an idiot. 

An argument could be made that though Blatter is intelligent, he may be a sexist. Maybe so. Brilliant, intelligent people could have many flaws including being sexist. But that doesn't mean what he said isn't true. The words that came out of Blatter's mouth were simple facts. 

Could women's soccer attract more sponsors if its players wore tighter, skimpier shorts? Probably. But who is better suited to make that decision than Blatter himself?

Women's soccer has gained much respect and attention over the last 10 years under Blatter's guidance. In the United States, it has become very acceptable for young ladies to participate in soccer. 

In America, if a girl plays soccer, nobody will ponder her sexual orientation. In other parts of the world, soccer has always long been been reserved for men. It's not uncommon to hear women soccer players in other countries perceived as lesbians. 

You might be asking: What does a soccer player's sexual preference have to do with the popularity of the game? 

In a perfect world, the answer would be nothing, but that isn't the case if you choose on being realistic in a country where sex runs rampant. So if we could step out of fantasy land for a second and realize that we are talking about selling the women's game to the men of the world, then Blatter's comments become even more justified.

For women's soccer to continue growing, it needs to reach the people who truly love soccer. An overpowering number of the people who spend money on tickets, replica jerseys and soccer paraphernalia are men. 

These men who love soccer want to watch high quality soccer; they do not care where it comes from. That is why English, Italian and Spanish soccer leagues are popular all over the world. Soccer watchers are not going to be lured in by women's soccer for its level of play. Although the women are very talented and play soccer with a tenacity and passion some men could learn from, it has not reached a balance worldwide to draw men in. 

Apart from the U.S., Scandanavia, Germany and China, the rest of the world is far behind in its ability to compete. 

It is not uncommon to see 6-0 outcomes in women international competitions.

How has the U.S. marketed its very successful national team? Has it marketed them as a tough bunch who walk and talk like men? No, they have marketed them as wholesome, pristine, immaculate women who are all-American. And why should they be marketed differerntly? The United States National Team is a group of very feminine women whose smiles light up a room. 

The Norways, Swedens and Germanys of the world do not have the same luxury. So how do we move the game along in other countries? We do it by marketing it the same way it has been marketed in the America. We market its players as feminine. One step, as Blatter suggested, would be to have women wear more feminine looking shorts and finding cosmetic endorsement deals. 

If women like Foudy continue to be opposed to this view and realize the facts, it will be difficult for women's soccer to compete with the men's game. 

As it stands now, most men are not interested in seeing the women's game compete against the men's version.

Headline: Baseball sliced by Golden Knights
Author: Natalie Sabia/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Feb. 7 - UCF 6, FIU 2

In the season opener for Central Florida, FIU was unable to get strong offensive production from anyone except Bryan Pullin and fell 6-2 to the Golden Knights on Feb. 7 at University Park. After losing its season openers to FIU the past two seasons, UCF was finally able to start the year with a win.

Pullin, a sophomore, had an explosive day at the plate, hitting two solo homeruns, which accounted for FIU's only two runs of the game. Pullin got both hits off UCF starter Matt Fox who threw five innings, striking out ten batters.  

However, despite Pullin's amazing afternoon, the Golden Panthers were not able to string anymore runs together.  

"It felt good for me, but at the same time to lose that way too, and not everybody having the hits at the same time, and not being able to put hits together didn't feel good," Pullin said.

Starter Mark Worrell (0-2) pitched 5.3 innings and struck out six, giving up only five hits and one walk on the day, but took the loss because of low run support.  

UCF quickly grabbed a 4-2 lead after three walks, a pinch-hit double and an FIU error in the sixth inning.  Without the defense playing up to its full potential, the Golden Panthers were not able to overcome the deficit.  

"When you only get two runs and they're both solos, I mean, it was kind of feeble for us really, to be honest with you," head coach Danny Price said after the game.

Feb. 8 - UCF 8, FIU 6

Nearly four hours and five pitchers after the game started, the Golden Panthers were swept after blowing a four run lead entering the fifth inning resulting in an 8-6 loss to UCF at University Park on Feb. 8. The loss dropped FIU to 1-4 on the season after losing two of three to FAMU just a week earlier.  

"Well it's two days in a row we've done this. You know it's just a breakdown with the concentration and focus. I am very disappointed in the loss and just really more disappointed in the way we played," said Price.

The Golden Panthers took a quick 3-1 lead in the bottom of the second inning after junior catcher Adrian Casanova hit a two-run homerun, which was the first of his career.

Still taking advantage of the Knights, FIU extended its lead in the fourth inning to 6-2, highlighted by two runs scored off of UCF errors. Casanova began with a single up the middle, making it his second hit of the day.  

Ex-UCF third baseman, P.J. Lehmann, who got the start at third base for FIU, got on base on a fielder's choice sacrifice bunt, which was misplayed by the Golden Knight catcher.  After an unsuccessful pickoff effort by UCF, Casanova scored and Lehmann advanced to third base.  

Making his first appearance, Eric Otero received his second-consecutive walk and loaded the bases. The next batter, Luis Rivera, was hit by a pitch, which brought home Lehmann and forced UCF to change pitchers. Loading the bases once more, this time Michael Lopez recorded a walk, scoring Otero and giving the Golden Panthers a blissful 6-2 lead.

However, FIU easily allowed their lead to vanish as UCF joined forces and got back in the game with three runs in the fifth and another run in the sixth, tying the game at six. Senior Andrew Edwards, who relieved FIU starter Denny Hernandez, allowed five runs, but only two were earned after two Golden Panther errors in the fifth.

"You have a 6-2 lead and can't hang in there and win that ball game with our [bullpen] full is very disappointing," Price said.

Junior pitcher Derek DeCarlo entered the game in the sixth inning and pitched two scoreless innings entering the ninth, with the score still knotted at six. But a throwing error by Lehmann and a RBI single by UCF's Drew Butera put the Golden Knights ahead 7-6 and gave DeCarlo his first loss of his FIU career. His career record fell to 17-1.

"It's something I think was gonna happen no matter what," said DeCarlo. "But we're not playing together right now. Something's not clicking as a team."

Headline: Softball drops four of five games at DeLong Invitational
Author: Andres Cordero/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU softball team is having a hard time finding markings in the win column. The Golden Panthers' early season woes continued, due mostly to the lack of timely hitting and little in the way of run support. As hosts of their second consecutive tournament at University Park from Feb. 6-8, the FIU women won only one of three games at the DeLong Invitational and fell to 2-6 to start the year. 

Feb. 6, Game One - FAU 3, FIU 2 (8 Innings)

In its first action of the tournament, FIU played an extra innings match-up and fell 3-2 to in-state rival Florida Atlantic on Feb. 6. 

Amanda Nealer got the start on the mound for FIU, matching up against FAU's Amanda Morin who pitched a complete game. Nealer did not allow a run and allowed just two hits through her first four innings of work. 

After being retired 1-2-3 in the fifth inning, the Lady Owls came up with a three-hit, two-run performance in the bottom of the inning to take the first lead of the game. An unearned run and third baseman Jenn Piazza's RBI single to center accounted for the scores. 

FIU answered immediately with a three-hit, two-run performance of its own in the top of the sixth. Junior Yarah Otero reached base on an infield single and junior centerfielder Jacque Vetters followed with a two-run homer to left-center, tying the game at two. 

Sophomore closer Nicole Barrett (0-2) took the mound in the seventh and was credited with the loss after 2.2 innings. The winning run came in the eighth when Cyclone right fielder Jennifer Cavanaugh hit a grounder to second scoring Jenn Piazza from third.

Morin (0-2) had six strikeouts and was awarded the win, marking her 17th straight decision without a loss. 


Feb. 6, Game Two - No. 16 Oregon 9, FIU 1

Four errors and a lack of offense resulted in a 9-1 FIU loss to No. 16 Oregon in the Golden Panthers' second game of the day Feb. 6.

The Ducks jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the fourth after a wild pitches by FIU starter Kendra Laminack and reliever Nicole Barrett, leading to two of Oregon's three runs in the inning. 

Laminack (1-2), originally from Portland, Oregon, allowed only three hits and four runs, but took the loss. Barrett allowed five runs on three hits in relief of Laminack.

FIU's lone run came in the sixth when an Ani Nyhus wild pitch allowed Vetters to score. Vetters was named to the All-Tournament team, courtesy of a .294 batting average, one home run, two doubles and two RBI over the weekend. 

The game was called in the bottom of the sixth due to the Mercy Rule after an Oregon five- run explosion, including a walk-off two-run homer by Oregon left fielder Ann Marie Topps.

Feb. 7, Game Three, No. 10 Georgia 7, FIU 1

FIU's third game resulted in its third straight loss, this time a 7-1 beating at the hands of the 10th ranked Georgia Bulldogs. The eventual FIU DeLong Invitational champions sent freshman Kasi Caroll to the mound as she dominated FIU, striking out seven batters and allowing only one run on three hits.

Nealer and Barrett combined to pitch for FIU. Nealer (0-1) pitched a respectable 4.2 innings and allowed just two hits, but gave up three runs and walked two batters. 

Barrett was lit up by the Bulldogs, allowing four hits and four runs in just over an inning of relief. Despite leading the nation with 11 saves last season, she has yet to register one through the first eight games this year. 

Offense came scarce for FIU, as the entire lineup was a combined 3-for-25 at the plate.

Feb. 7, Game Four - FIU 3, Iowa State 0
	 
In FIU's fourth game of the tournament, Kendra Laminack pitched a stellar, complete game, two-hit shutout, leading to a 3-0 FIU win on Feb. 7. Laminack struck out four batters and improved to 2-3 on the year with an ERA of 2.25. 

Second baseman Lindsay Tippings opened the scoring in the second with a bases loaded sacrifice fly to right that scored junior catcher Marleah Stapf. Tippings was 1-for-1 with two RBI in the game, tying Jacque Vetters with a team leading four RBI on the year. 

Tippings walked to begin the fifth inning with FIU leading 1-0. Pinch running for Tippings, Hialeah local Jessica Hernandez advanced to second on a Tabitha Embry sacrifice bunt. Vetters then singled to second advancing Hernandez to third. With Kristen Perry at the plate, Vetters stole second and Hernandez stole home as part of a double steal.
	
Tippings added a RBI double to center in the sixth, bringing home freshman Kristin Mestre from second base, increasing FIU's lead to 3-0.

Alyssa Ransom (0-2) took the loss for the Cyclones after seven strong innings of work in which she struck out eight FIU batters. She gave up four hits, four walks, and three runs.

Feb. 8, Game Five (Third Place Game) - Iowa State 1, FIU 0

After Kendra Laminack's performance against ISU the day before, the Cyclones' Kristen Karanzias pitched a complete-game, two-hit shutout of her own to down the Golden Panthers 1-0 in s fight for third place at University Park. 
Cyclone's victory.

Karanzias struck out four Golden Panther batters and did not issue a walk.

Nealer started the game for FIU, but it was Laminack (2-3) who was charged with the loss after giving up the only run of the game despite having faced just three batters in the fourth inning.

Nealer returned to finish the game, giving up two hits and no additional runs. The offense again failed to provide any run support, going 2-for-25 at the plate and the host team dropped their fourth game in five tournament match-ups. 

FIU will have the week off before hosting Florida Atlantic on Feb. 17.

Subheadline: The Beacon takes a look at the top five most attractive women in professional sports today.
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
1. Jennie Finch - USA Softball, Pitcher

In a recent poll conducted by ESPN.com asking who the sexiest female athlete is between Finch and Anna Kournikova, Finch received 62.8 percent of the vote, compared to only 37.1 percent for Kournikova - signifying a new queen in the world of women's sports. 

Finch, a former pitcher for the Arizona Wildcats, holds the NCAA record for consecutive wins with 60. 

The 6-foot, 23-year-old blonde beauty was twice named winner of the Honda Award, given to the nation's top softball player. Recently, she was named to the 2004 Olympic Team (time for me to watch).

2. Sue Bird - Seattle Storm (WNBA), Guard

Since her days at UConn, there was always something about Bird that caught my eye. 

She was the attractive point guard for the Huskies team that went 39-0 and won the National Championship in 2002. As a result, she was awarded the Honda Award as the nation's top women's basketball player. Since then, the 5-foot-9-inch brunette has become a star for the Storm in the WNBA. 

Bird, 22, made a bet with a Seattle radio host last season saying that if she didn't have better than a 2-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio, she would allow him to spank her and have her yell, "Harder, Daddy, harder" - but if she won, the host would have to buy season tickets to the Storm. Bird later cancelled the wager to much of the male population's disappointment. 

3. Mia Hamm - Washington Freedom (WUSA), Forward

Does anyone have better legs than her? 

Hamm, arguably the best women's soccer player of all time, is seeing her career wind down at age 32, but she's still hot as ever. She has already won a gold medal with the USA Soccer Team and ended 1999 as the world's all-time leading scorer with 114 goals and 93 assists. 

She is currently engaged to Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.

4. Heather Mitts - Philadelphia Charge (WUSA), Defender

Mitts is 5'5", slender, has beautiful blonde hair, a gorgeous face and looks like a model. 

Oh yeah, she also plays soccer for the Charge of the WUSA. Mitts, 25 has established herself as a solid defender in the league after graduating from the University of Florida in 1999. She also has played for the U.S. Under-21 National Team.

5. Serena Williams - U.S. Tennis

Williams is solid muscle and has a perfectly sculpted body with plenty of curves. 

Not only that, but she is also the most successful women's tennis player in the world over the last five years. The 22-year-old beat Martina Hingis in 1999 for the U.S. Open Championship, becoming the first African-American woman to win a Grand Slam title since Althea Gibson in 1958.
