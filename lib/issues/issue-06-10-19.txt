Headline: Volleyball loses first two SBC matches of the season
Author: Renaldo Smith / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Riding a giant wave of momentum from nine consecutive wins, with the promise of one of their more lethal outside hitters returning from injury, the Golden Panther women's volleyball squad was brimming over with confidence going into their two road games last week.

However, all of that optimism somehow resulted in disappointment, and even the return of freshman power hitter Yarimar Rosa to the lineup couldn't stop two consecutive loses to conference powerhouses,  the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers and the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders.

The Golden Panthers fell in a tough 3-2 loss to the Hill toppers on Friday (17-30, 30-27, 29-31, 35-33, 11-15), and followed that up with a dismal performance as the Blue Raiders made it look easy with a 3-0 (30-26, 30-21, 30-28) sweep on Sunday.

According to Golden Panther Head Coach Danijela Tomic, her team has to bring the same intensity on the road that they display at home.

"It's always easier to play at home with the fans behind us. This season we have had great attendance and our fans have been loud and supportive but also must learn how to win on the road," Tomic said. "They are down a bit because it is not easy to lose, especially with all the success we are having. We have to bounce back, refocus, and work on our weaknesses." 



WKU 3, FIU 2



The loss to the Hilltoppers snapped the schools Division I-era record nine match wining streak, but the Panthers did deliver some strong performances. Rosa made a solid return with a team-high 19 kills and 15 digs. Freshman Olga Vergun continued her strong play of late with a 15 kill, 7 block effort, and Arasay Guerra was also a factor with 13 kills. Junior setter Keila Oliveria had a double-double with 45 assists and 13 digs, while junior Mina Spasojevic had a career and team season high 10 blocks.

The Hilltoppers may have caught the Panthers off guard early on as they wasted little time asserting their dominance. They jumped out to a 6-1 lead in the opening game, en route to holding FIU to under 20 points in a game for the first time all season. Although the Golden Panthers did win two games, they had to fight from behind every single time and that fatigue was evident in the final game.

After coming out strong en route to an 11-10 lead, the Golden Panthers appeared to run out of gas when they needed it most and the Hilltoppers ran off five consecutive points to take the match.

Julia Noe had a strong all-around game for the Hilltoppers with 60 assists, 15 kills, and seven blocks and All-American Megan Argabright was deadly with 21 kills and six blocks of her own.



MTSU 3, FIU 0



Following that blow, the Golden Panthers delivered a sub-par performance against Middle Tennessee as they suffered just their fourth sweep of the season, and their first in over a month.

Rosa once again led the Panthers with 15 kills, and Oliveira added 37 assists and six kills at a .385 clip.

Leslie Clark was a monster offensively for the Blue Raiders with 38 kills, and six blocks. Quanshell Scott had eight kills, and Ashley Adams was good for 15 kills on a scorching .636 hitting in the win.

After never giving themselves a chance in the first two games, the Golden Panthers had a 26-20 lead in the third and look poised to contend. However, it wasn't meant to be as the Blue Raiders closed the match on a 10-2 run.

The Golden Panthers will look to get back on the winning track this Oct. 20 in another road game against Arkansas State.

Headline: CSS analyst fired for comments made during brawl
Author: Tim Reynolds / AP Wire
&nbsp;
Former Miami player Lamar Thomas lost his TV analyst job Monday over comments he made during a sideline-clearing brawl involving the Hurricanes and Florida International.

Comcast Sports SouthEast, a regional cable network that hired Thomas before the season, also decided to edit out his comments before the game is replayed later this week.

"We were disappointed in the incident that happened on the field and regret the way it was handled in the broadcast booth," CSS general manager Mark Fuhrman said. "We do not support or condone the inappropriate comments made by color analyst Lamar Thomas and have taken the necessary steps to prevent a similar situation from ever occurring again."

CSS, which is available in 5.5 million homes, will replay the game twice Wednesday.

Thomas made his comments as dozens of Miami and FIU players stormed the Orange Bowl field and fought during the third quarter of their teams' game Saturday night, an incident that led to the suspension of at least 31 players and forced officials from both schools to publicly apologize for the melee.

"Now, that's what I'm talking about," Thomas said as the brawl raged out of control. "You come into our house, you should get your behind kicked. You don't come into the OB playing that stuff. You're across the ocean over there. You're across the city. You can't come over to our place talking noise like that. You'll get your butt beat. I was about to go down the elevator to get in that thing."

Miami and Florida International have campuses 9 miles apart in Miami-Dade County. It was the first meeting between the two programs, and the Hurricanes went on to win 35-0.

As the fight slowed, Thomas' comments continued.

"I say, why don't they just meet outside in the tunnel after the ball game and get it on some more? You don't come into the OB, baby," Thomas said. "We've had a down couple years but you don't come in here talking smack. Not in our house."

A tape of the fight, including Thomas' comments, was available on the Internet on Sunday and Monday. The game was available for viewing Saturday night on a pay-per-view basis.

Thomas was a third-round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1993 and spent six seasons in the NFL, three with the Bucs and three with the Miami Dolphins.

He has a Gainesville address, but there was no listed telephone number for him in that area. He could not be reached Monday.

Fuhrman said CSS consulted with Miami officials before determining what action needed to be taken. 

Miami recommends on-air personnel for its broadcasts, Fuhrman said.

Headline: Women's soccer splits two at home
Author: Magaly Estrella / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The woman's soccer team shutdown Troy Oct. 13 and didn't need a Trojan horse to do it. In a stellar performance, no less spectacular than Achilles, freshman Camilla Durrant led the way with a hat trick in a 6-0 shutout of the Trojans (2-11-1, 1-6) in Sun Belt Conference play.

Senior Cassidy Proctor wasted no time as she scored on sophomore Maria Gualdron's assist in the first minute of the match. Proctor muscled the ball into the upper left side of the goal for her second tally of the year.

Durrant scored her first of three goals in the 19th minute, when she obtained a rebound senior Valerie Patrick was unable to capitalize on, to make it 2-0 FIU. Durrant blasted the ball into the upper left hand side of the net after it deflected off the goalkeeper's extended arms. It was Durrant's first home game since moving from England and her fourth game this season. 

"The ball went all the way down the side; I managed to keep it in play, it ricocheted off the girl and went in the top corner. It was a good one, I'm quite pleased about it," she said.

The Golden Panthers caught a lucky break in the 39th minute when junior Kristen Hurst's cross was unintentionally tapped in by Trojans Goalkeeper Erin Kniery making the score 3-0.

At the end of the first half, the Golden Panthers were literally running circles around a sluggish moving Troy. FIU had taken 17 shots compared to 3 from Troy. 

Shortly after the beginning of the second half, Durrant seized an opportunity to score her second goal of the night, making the match 4-0. The goal came in the 47th minute from an assist from freshman Marina Pappas. The ball was a cross from the goal line and Durrant managed to get an open shot and kicked the ball into the left side of the net in front of the goalkeeper. 

Just seven minutes later, freshman Nanna Rasmussen blazed the ball past the goalkeeper into the upper right corner of the goal, making the game 5-0.

Durrant's third tally of the night came in the 59th minute as the Golden Panthers completed the shut-out at 6-0. After receiving a cross from Gualdron, Durrant sent the ball airborne and went in just below the crossbar.

"The last couple of weeks we got beat 5-0 and 5-1, it's good to be on the other side of that, winning 6-0 … we decided to play a little bit more simple; we tried to pass the ball, spread the ball out and use the width of the field more than we've done in the past," said coach Everton Edwards.



USA 3, FIU 1



The Golden Panthers failed to win their last home game of the season as they fell to the South Alabama Jaguars (5-11, 3-5)  3-1 Oct. 14 in a Sun Belt Conference contest. Although FIU (4-10, 2-6) held an 11-9 edge in shots for the game and had eight corner kicks without surrendering any to the Jaguars, it proved not to be enough as the Jaguars scored two goals within four minutes.

Tara Smith got South Alabama on the board with an unassisted strike in the 14th minute. Smith managed to get around the goalkeeper but was blocked. Perseverance paid off, however, and she scored her second time around as the ball rolled into the back of the net making the match 1-0.

In the 34th minute, FIU answered back to the Jaguars as freshman Nanna Rasmussen scored off an assist from sophomore Maria Gualdron, her third of the season. Rasmussen torpedoed the ball into the upper right corner of the goal tying the match 1-1.

Jenn Edgar helped seal the victory for South Alabama with a pair of assists. Edgar crossed to Samantha Stocker who completed the play by shooting the ball into the right corner of the goal, in the 54th minute for her seventh tally of the season as the Jaguars took the lead 2-1. Four minutes later, Edgar added to the damage when she setup a goal opportunity for Amanda Douglas who caught the goalkeeper off guard. Douglas scored from 30 yards out on a long high curving shot that dropped into the net making the score 3-1.

The Golden Panthers will travel to Arkansas as they prepare for more Sun Belt Conference play against Arkansas State Oct. 20 at 4 p.m., followed by a 1 p.m. game Oct. 22 with Arkansas-Little Rock.

Headline: Hope's two goals lead FIU
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Senior forward David Hope recently told The Beacon that he wants to be remembered as "a player who worked and played hard everyday."

Hope took a step toward cementing that legacy by leading FIU (6-6-2, 2-3 Conference-USA) to a 2-0 victory over Memphis (9-5, 2-3) at the FIU Soccer Stadium. The Newcastle, England native scored twice in the Oct. 15 match and gave the Golden Panthers a much needed jolt of offense.

"Scoring is the last thing to click for a young team and I'm very pleased that it's coming now," said head coach Karl Kremser. "Our team has a lot of people playing out of [their usual] position and they're just getting to know one another. We created chances when we lost other games, but things are coming together at the right time now."

Sophomore midfielder Óli Birgisson connected with Hope in the ninth minute to put FIU ahead 1-0. Birgisson raced towards the goal after winning a 50/50 challenge at midfield, and then cut the ball back to the top of the penalty box. Hope then sent the ball zooming into the lower right corner of the goal.

Memphis goalkeeper Michael Goodlett momentarily kept the Tigers in the match by saving a shot from FIU sophomore defender Cory Kendall in the 86th minute. But Goodlett couldn't stop Hope from putting the loose ball into an open net to secure a 2-0 victory and earn his second brace of the season.

Hope's two goals continued a sudden burst of offense for FIU. After being shut-out in back-to-back losses to Tulsa and South Carolina, the Golden Panthers have scored five goals in their last two matches.

"It gives everybody's confidence a boost and helps quite a bit," said Kremser of the rejuvenated offense. "If we fall behind, we can still always find some goals. Everybody realizes that we're able to put some points on the board, and that takes pressure off of the defense instead of them feeling like they have to shut everybody out."

The defensive unit, however, did manage to shut-out Memphis. Kyle Thomas earned his first victory of the season, notching a game-high four saves. Thomas faced a major test in the 24th minute when a defensive miscue nearly sent a headed back-pass into the net. He dove and knocked the ball away to prevent an own goal.

FIU took six first half shots, capitalizing on a similar spark of offense that led to a 3-1 victory over Marshall (4-7-1, 1-3) in an Oct. 11 match. Senior defender Chris Handy started the attack with a floating 40-yard shot that caught Thundering Herd goalkeeper Greg Walter by surprise in the 12th minute. Hope added to the score with a 20-yard blast in the 25th minute, and freshman forward Christian Caporaletti capped the win with a curling free kick in the 39th minute.

FIU will try to continue its current form when the team travels to face Kentucky (9-4-1, 2-2) Oct. 21. Both squads, along with Memphis, are locked in a three-way tie for fifth place in C-USA. The match winner will likely have the best chance of securing a home game in the conference tournament. 

"We have to win out. We just have to," Kremser said. "We've positioned ourselves to get into the conference tournament, but you want to position yourself to get a good seed and avoid playing one of the better teams early on. 

"The higher up we move, the better it will be for us come tournament time."

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Suicide problem more complex than it seems
Author: Paul Benavides / Sophomore / Psychology Major
&nbsp;
Bobby Joe Bracy's article, "Education can save a boy's life," in the Oct. 12 issue of The Beacon makes a compelling argument about the possible [correlation between] education and suicide among young males.  

However, if one looks at high school dropout rates in the United States, one sees that they are slowly decreasing, not increasing, along with the suicide rate among adolescents - this highlights the complexity of the matter.

Another point to consider, according to a 1996 study, is that girls are more than twice as likely than boys to report a suicide attempt - this element might explain why reports show higher rates of suicide attempts among females, and less in males.

There is also another important factor to consider: according to many sources, about 60 percent of suicides involve firearms, and according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, males are seven times more likely than females to use a firearm in completing a suicide.

The story behind suicide is very complex. Current investigations provide comprehensive analyses that include a history of family/life stressors, physical/sexual abuse, substance abuse and psychosocial problems as better predictors of suicide.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: True pride takes responsibility
Author: Patricio Mendez / Senior / Political Science
&nbsp;
The FIU football team's total lack of restraint and poise has been well documented in all media outlets, including our very own Beacon. Yet, perhaps a more discomforting account has yet to be written about our own student body.

It is disheartening, to say the least, to hear in all my classes how much pride students are taking in the events that took place in that football game. I am not referring about defending the school; after all, defending the school is an inherent requirement of school pride. 

The disturbing idea is the lack of pride for the school. If there was such a thing as school pride for FIU, then students would not defend the actions taken by those few football players who were supposed to represent our school in the most important sport event our school has been a part of. 

The players' actions that day were at best immature and irresponsible, but the fact that so many students are actually taking pride in it seems to point out that the incident is merely a representation of the quality of students within our institutions. 

People need to understand that there is a difference between popularity and notoriety; between recognition and infamy. By celebrating the actions of those players, students are rejoicing the latter and putting the players' egos ahead of the prestige of our school - a far worse mistake than the one committed last Saturday night.

Headline: Editorial: FIU football rivalry lacks sportsmanship
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Despite what a small minority of students think, the Oct. 14 fight at the Orange Bowl between FIU and the University of Miami football players is nothing to be proud of.

FIU and UM players punching, kicking, stomping and body slamming each other isn't the type of publicity the University was seeking from a potential inner city rivalry. 

FIU has invested a significant amount of money into establishing a football program. Now, its hopes for a successful future have been compromised by a few players' momentary lapse of reason.

Before the melee began, everything seemed to have been heading in the right direction for FIU's growing football program: new athletic director Pete Garcia was on the way from UM and the Board of Trustees just approved $34 million to renovate the FIU Stadium.

All that came crashing down during the nine-minute mark of the third quarter when players from both sidelines stormed the field.

"Football is an emotional game, but there's a line you can't cross," FIU head coach Don Strock said. "There is no place in the great game of college football for anything like this, and I apologize."

An apology won't help anything now; FIU's image has already been blackened by the scuffle.

Since Saturday night, ESPN and every other media outlet have been airing clips of the fight over and over. Hardly anybody in the country knew that FIU even existed or had a football team, for that matter.

Now, the first thing that will come to peoples' mind when they think of FIU will be something similar to the thug image that the UM football team earned for itself back when Jimmy Johnson and Dennis Erickson coached the program.

As a relatively young football program, what FIU needed most was to make a name for itself. Unfortunately for FIU athletics, the saying that any publicity is good publicity does not apply in this case. The image from that night's Orange Bowl catastrophe will follow FIU's athletic program for years to come. 

Given all this, the University made the right move by administering stricter punishments for the players involved than the one-game suspension mandated by the Sun Belt Conference. The indefinite suspension of 16 players and the removal of senior defensive back Chris Smith and junior Marshall McDuffie will send the message that FIU is serious about making sure this a one-time incident and not a matter of course. 

At the same time, FIU acted fairly by allowing the Athletic Department to honor Smith and McDuffie's scholarships until they graduate.

Booting them from the team was punishment enough; any other course of action would have been excessive. They made a mistake as athletes, and it was right to punish them as athletes. However, their mistake on the playing field should not carry into their academic lives. 

"We're going to be committed to them. They came here to get an education. It's our obligation to them and their family that we do everything now more than ever to make sure they leave with a degree," Garcia said.

What's done is done. An unseemly mistake was made that night, and now both teams and universities have no other choice but to move on.

More importantly, if this newborn rivalry continues on to other years, it must be played in a competitive but sportsmanlike manner.

Headline: Education gap widens for black students
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I have to hand it to the Bush family - no other political clan has mastered the art of distraction quite like them. The Kennedys may have a more popular brand, but the Bush surname is synonymous with unwavering spin.

That's why I must applaud Florida governor Jeb Bush for his ridiculous claim that he helped improve the education of minorities in this state.

Bush recently addressed a crowd in Orlando and patted himself on the back for the "progress" Florida's Blacks and Hispanics have made during his administration.

He cited an academic study - which just happened to be funded by two Republicans who donated to his gubernatorial campaigns - to support the claim. According to them, Bush is a "trendsetter" who revolutionized minority education.

Way to go, Mr. Governor. Your keen leadership has led to an astonishing 1.6 percent increase in black enrollment at Florida's 11 public universities. That translates to 606 more black students in the State University System than there were last year. It's all very impressive for a state that graduated more than 130,000 high-school students in 2006.

Governor Bush is clearly one of a kind. Who else can use a 1.6 percent increase as a basis to say, "We have made progress in this state over the past eight years. We know because we measure"?

Well, Mr. Governor, measure this: in 1999, your first year in power, 14.2 percent of students at Florida public universities were black. Now, blacks account for only 13.7 percent. Even for a Bush, calling that drop-off "progress" takes considerable nerve.  

During his re-election bid in 2002, Bush hyped the One Florida Initiative, which omitted race as a factor in the selection process at state universities. Thousands of blacks struggled to gain entry into college, but Jeb Bush, ever the miracle-maker, said he could change that if re-elected. 

Four years later, blacks still lag behind whites at state public universities.

 If Bush or his supporters truly cared about improving black enrollment at state universities, they would spend $250,000 on school systems in desperate need of better resources rather than on a self-serving "study." 

They would go to Tallahassee and spark positive reform rather than simply talk about it for eight years.

Educational opportunities for blacks have not improved under the One Florida Initiative, and they never will until people admit that there's no such thing as one Florida. 

Black students at Miami Edison Senior High, which is grossly under-funded, underdeveloped and understaffed, are a world away from the affluent, white students at Miami Palmetto Senior High. The two schools are separated by less than 20 miles, but the educational gap between them stretches much farther. 

Until people are willing to accept that undeniable reality, the social and educational status of blacks in Florida will never change.

Headline: University organizations tackle spirituality on Coming Out Day
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Students wrapped up National Coming Out Day at FIU with a drag king performance of the song "I'm Your Man" Oct. 12. After a packed day of events, they relaxed and cheered as the drag king took off her tie and grabbed an audience member to dance.

National Coming Out Day is celebrated around the world Oct. 11 in commemoration of the 1987 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer march in Washington, D.C. where thousands of people gathered to support equal rights for LGBTQ Americans.

Due to scheduling conflicts, FIU organizers celebrated it Oct. 12. 

The event is hosted nationally by the Human Rights Campaign.

Though the day has been celebrated at FIU before, this year's was the biggest to date, according to organizer Gloria Bauta, president of Stonewall Pride Alliance. 

In a massive collaboration, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services worked with FIU's Center for the Study of Spirituality, Residential Life, Stonewall Pride Alliance and other student clubs, as well as professors and community organizations to plan the day-long event.

Unlike years past, this year the day's line-up featured tabling in the Graham Center by LGBTQ-friendly congregations and an interfaith presentation, Coming Out Spiritually, in the GC Pit.

This year organizers gave a new emphasis to the day's celebration.

"In planning for the event we noticed that students have a hard time spiritually coming out with their families and churches, so we decided to address that," Bauta said.

Other FIU and community organizations also presented informational material to students, including the Victim Advocacy Center, the Women's Center, Delta Lambda Phi fraternity and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. 

Later during the day organizers hosted a reception, Come Out Among Friends, in the Panther Suite in GC, and a potluck dinner in the Everglades Lounge followed by a drag show.

A.J. Costa, graduate assistant for LGBTQ Initiatives in the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services, led the organizational effort.

"We really wanted this to be a chance to come together and celebrate NCOD," she said. "The goal is visibility of support for the LGBTQ population on campus, and the University is making an effort to show greater support this year."

Last spring, when a religious organization openly criticized the LGBTQ community on campus, Stonewall Pride Alliance, in conjunction with the National Organization for Women, held a petition drive and submitted a proposal to Vice President of Student Affairs Rosa Jones to request that FIU acquire a LGBTQ resource center.

As a response, a new position was created within the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services, which Costa currently fills. 

"I think we really got to grow this year because we actually have a University staff member who can devote their time and energy to these initiatives," Costa said.

At the end of the day, over 40 students came together with organizers to enjoy the drag show, which featured a drag king and queen who perform at local clubs.

As they waited for the music to play and the drag king to appear, they looked back to the day's success.

Gisela Vega, assistant director of Residential Life, said, "One of the benefits of today is that it puts this community, which is often marginalized at FIU, in the forefront."

Buta agreed.

"The best thing is that we were able to provide a safe zone for people to come out," she said.

Students who participated in the day's festivities also mentioned the amiable atmosphere they found.

"I think today was really successful; I had a lot of fun doing it," said freshman Patrick McCaul. "I'm from Detroit, and people aren't nearly as accepting there as they are in Miami."

Sophomore Jenny Ruiz felt it was important for all students to show support.

"I'm not gay, but I'm here to give my friends moral support," she said.

Organizers are currently planning a second even larger celebration in the Spring semester that will feature national speakers and more community collaboration.

Headline: TKEs remember deceased friend
Author: Maria Chercoles / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
It was silent in the Graham Center's forum Oct. 14 when friends of FIU student James Noel-Pou gathered for his remembrance ceremony a week after he passed away in a boat accident.

FIU fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon hosted the ceremony, which took place the same day Noel-Pou would have celebrated his 24th birthday. More than 80 people attended.

Noel-Pou was among the nine people involved in a boat accident on the way back from the Columbus Day Regatta in Biscayne Bay Oct. 7. FIU student Monica Burguera, 20, also died in the accident. The tragedy took place after the 22 ft. rental boat they were riding in - which broke down and was being towed back to port without functioning lights - was hit by a 35 ft. powerboat.

In the middle of the confusion, Noel-Pou was not seen after the accident, and some believed to have seen him walk out of the scene after the boat reached shore, according to The Sun-Sentinel. However, he was reported missing Oct. 8 after he was not found in any hospital. His body was finally found floating near the Vizcaya Channel by a boater Oct. 9.

The seven other passengers of the boat suffered serious injuries, including FIU student Andres Perez, 20, who is still recuperating from a broken pelvis.

During the ceremony, Noel-Pou's closest friends stood on the podium to say their last words to their lost friend.

Behind the stand, "TKE," the three fraternity letters, stood as a symbol of the fraternity's unity, and flowers and red candles decorated the stage. Noel-Pou served twice as the fraternity's president and vice president.

"James cared about everyone. He was very dedicated to his family and friends," said Noel-Pou's fraternity brother Bryan Docobo, who was also Noel-Pou's roommate for one year. "He will be with me forever."

"This is among the hardest things I've done. I did not get to have the fraternity experience with James, but I did get to spend very good times with him," said fraternity brother José Coloma. "I got a call telling me James was missing. Next day, all of us went out looking for him in hospitals, all over Coconut Grove, anywhere we could think of. That shows how strong our brotherhood is."

"He was always there for meetings and events. It is very hard to say good-bye to a friend like him, but that is what he would want us to do," said Javier Manso, who knew Noel-Pou from FIU's chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineering.

After the remembrance ceremony a birthday party was set to take place at the home of Diego Suarez, a close friend of Noel-Pou.

"Everyone knows what a great man James was and is. I say 'is' because spiritually he will always remain within us," Suarez said. "Tonight we are going to do what he would have wanted us to do: party and celebrate his life and his birthday like if he were still with us."

Noel-Pou's family was not present at the event. According to Docobo, Noel-Pou's parents were in Puerto Rico, Noel-Pou's homeland, where his ashes were to be buried.

The ceremony ended with the display of a framed collage of Noel-Pou's pictures made by TKE, which will be sent to his family. 

Authorities are still investigating the cause of the accident, and are considering whether any navigational laws were violated, including whether the 16-year-old boy who was driving the towboat passed a required boating-safety class that includes instructions on towing rules.

"Everything is being investigated, from proper permits, to speed, to lighting and to the consumption of alcohol," said Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino to The Miami Herald. 

So far no charges have been filed by any of the families.

Headline: Maidique discusses BBC land sale
Author: C. Joel Marino and Betsy Martinez / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
(This is the third part of an interview University President Modesto A. Maidique granted The Beacon. The fourth and final interview will be published Oct. 23, in which Maidique will discuss the new FIU campus in Tianjin, China.)

Q: Your contract with the University was extended this year. However, your new salary seems a little high when compared to other Florida university presidents. How do you justify this?

High? The president of the University of Central Florida, our peer, got a salary of $450,000, got a bonus of $100,000 and got a retention bonus of $210,000.

If you can add those numbers, that's [$760,000], plus several other perks that I didn't total up brought the contract up to $900,000.

Most of our trustees think that they have significantly undershot relative to the competition, so it's just the other way around; the market's going in the other direction. I would hazard a guess that after all the contracts are done, I'd be lucky to be averaging the state among these other presidents, and we are one of the largest universities in the state, so that's not the case at all.

Q: Why did the University try to sell 26 acres of land in Biscayne?

So we can get scholarships for guys like you.

That land sale might have given us $150 million in addition to our endowments. If you take $150 million and you use it for endowments that's 5 percent, that'd be $7.5 million.

There are various ways to cut that, but if you cut it at a thousand, that'd be 7,500 scholarships per year for $1,000 or 2,500 scholarships at $3,000.

Those scholarships would've gone either to needy students or to excellent students.

It was trading land for endowment and endowment for scholarships.

Q: What is FIU planning to do with the land now that it's not for sale?

Well, who said it wasn't?

Q: So where does the case stand?

The authority for that [resides in] the legislature. If you look at my record, you'll see I never give up. It may be in hibernation, but it's not out of the question.

It's some of the most attractive land in the state of Florida, it's right there on the water at Biscayne Bay.

Q: Do you have any other plans for the Biscayne Bay Campus? Some people seem to perceive it as the "forgotten campus."

I never forget it. The fact that we have appointed a hard-driving, a tough, forward-looking guy [new BBC vice-provost Damien Fernandez] who developed a plan for the future of the campus means that that campus has an exciting future.

Headline: Annual convocation ceremony honors FIU faculty
Author: Maria Chercoles / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
More than 200 faculty members and students attended the 2006 Faculty Convocation and Awards Ceremony in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center Oct. 13, including President Modesto A. Maidique, Interim Provost Ronald Berkman, Chancellor Mark Rosenberg and guest speaker Richard M. Freeland, former president of Northeastern University in Boston.

A number of awards were distributed during the ceremony, including the Council of 100 Outstanding Faculty Award, which each year recognizes a leading FIU professor with outstanding achievements in the areas of teaching and research.

This year Nancy Wellman, professor of dietetics and nutrition, received the award for her research and expertise on aging, nutrition screening and public policy, and her involvement in organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the United States Department of Agriculture and the International Food Information Council. In its sixth year, the award, founded by FIU's advocacy group, consists of a $10,000 cash prize.

The other 35 awards were granted on the areas of teaching, research, service, undergraduate advising, librarianship, adjunct teaching, and for the first year, in graduate mentorship.

Also during the ceremony, Maidique was taken by surprise when Faculty Senate Chair Bruce Hauptli awarded him the FIU's Distinguished Service Medallion for his 20 years as FIU president, celebrated Oct. 12, and for his many accomplishments at FIU.

The ceremony began with a performance by the Brass Ensemble of the School of Music, followed by a performance by organist W. Dan Hardin, while college deans and faculty members walked onto the stage wearing their academic regalia.

After welcoming everyone, Berkman gave a speech pointing out the three things at the top of his agenda.

"As an institution, we are working on improving the flow [of] knowledge between faculty and students," Berkman said. "We are also trying to promote students' international experience, and finally, we are working [on] creating an urban university which would allow a political, economical and social experience to the students."

Maidique followed by citing FIU's latest accomplishments.

"This past year was a year of milestones. After 12 years, we finally received approval on our medicine school," Maidique said. "Another accomplishment was moving the School of Law into a new building, which is one of the best law school buildings in Florida."

Among the other things Maidique mentioned were FIU's undergraduate business program, which ranks seventh in the country, the graduate business program, which ranks in the country's top 25, and the recent collaboration between the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and FIU to host the New York Times Student Journalism Institute at FIU next January.

"NAHJ was considering different schools, but it chose FIU because of the quality of our teaching. The excellence of our programs are being recognized," Maidique said.

Lastly, Maidique made reference to the large number of students per class, which brought laughs when he said, "We will continue working on that."

After Maidique received the Distinguished Service Medallion, the 35 faculty members were called one by one to receive their award.

Jeffrey Horstmyer, past chair of the Council of 100, announced the candidates to this year's Council of 100 Outstanding Faculty Award, and silence filled the room before Wellman's name was called and was followed by applauses and cheers from the public.

"I am very pleased. I knew I was between the three finalists, but this was a complete surprise," Wellman said.

After the awards, Freeland closed the ceremony by addressing the audience about an "Academic Community in Urban Universities."

"I have to congratulate Maidique; the progress of this university has been outstanding," Freeland said. "Now FIU has another mission: to build an urban university. And I am pleased to say that the three things that will not help create it are not present at FIU: homogeneity, the idea of separateness and the idea of self-containment."

The faculty convocation and awards ceremony were part of the events that took place last week during the Faculty Convocation 2006, which included a lecture by former Miami Herald publisher David Lawrence Oct. 10, and a performance by folk singer David Roth Oct. 11.

After the awards ceremony, a luncheon with Rosenberg took place in the Graham Center Ballroom to close the 2006 convocation.

Headline: SGA holds emergency meeting on amendments
Author: Angelina Troff / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Government Association University-wide Council held an emergency meeting Oct.13 that centered on two constitutional amendments, which both passed unanimously.

The first amendment would split the College of Health and Urban Affairs representative into three representatives, being that the college itself has been divided. Also, the College of Engineering and the College of Architecture representatives will be updated to reflect their name changes within the University: the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the College of Architecture and the Arts.

The Biscayne Bay Campus composition would change to include a College of Education and Honors College representative, and remove the CHUA and nursing representative positions.

"There is no need for [the nursing representative] position because there are no nursing majors at our campus," said Camilo Silva, SGC-BBC president, after the meeting. "We have an elementary education program starting [at BBC], so we will have upper division [education] students."

The amendment passed without discussion.

This amendment will go into effect before the Spring election if voted upong by students in the Oct. 24 and Oct. 25 Fall elections. SGC-UP President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon said that the first change needed to occur now so they could be implemented by the Spring semester election.

In contrast, the second amendment will go into effect immediately after the Fall semester elections if ratified by the student body. It would strike Campus Life as a Standing Committee. Currently, SGC-BBC has a Campus Life chairperson and SGC-UP has it as a cabinet position.

"This position would be more efficient as a cabinet position than a committee," said Providence Okoye, SGC-UP vice president, during the meeting. However, she did not list the benefits.

These amendments will be presented as two different voting issues on the October ballot. Leon said that the changes prepared for the Spring semester election ballot will be presented as one big "yes" or "no" vote instead of voting on each individual change.

The reason for this decision is that there are two different effective dates, according to Leon.

Constitutional amendments must first pass through UWC or a five percent petition of the student body, and then be approved by a majority of students voting at an SGA election.

The Beacon reported on Oct. 2 that the UWC decided at their Sept. 29 meeting not to change the consitution this semester because they wanted students to have more time to review potential changes.

Leon announced a proposed UWC meeting for Oct. 13 at a SGC-UP meeting on Oct. 11.  However, the specific time and location of the meeting were not known until minutes before it took place in the SGC-UP office.

Five out of eight members attended to make quorum.

In attendance were Leon, Silva and three members via telephone: Okoye, SGC-BBC Comptroller Zachary Trautenburg and SGC-BBC Speaker of the House Gabriel Labrador. SGC-BBC Vice President Pamela St. Fleur, SGC-UP Comptroller Nancy Cadavid and SGC-UP Speaker of the House Rocio Perez were absent from the meeting.

Headline: TWO DISMISSED: Players get penalties after brawl
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The aftermath of the University of Miami-FIU brawl continued Oct. 16 as FIU announced during a press conference that they would extend the suspensions originally handed down by the University and the Sun Belt Conference. 

Athletic Director Pete Garcia, during his first full day in charge, announced that as a result of the actions taken by players at the Orange Bowl two members of the team were dismissed and another 16 were suspended indefinitely. 

"It is certainly not something we condone or find acceptable," said coach Don Strock. "We have dismissed two players and indefinitely suspended 16 others. There is no place in the great game of college football for anything like this and I apologize."

Senior safety Chris Smith and junior free safety Marshall McDuffie were immediately dismissed from the team, but will keep their full scholarships as students at the University. They will also be provided with all the services that are granted to student-athletes, which include the services of the FIU Student-Athlete Academic Center that is comprised of advising, tutoring and academic progress reports.

"It is our obligation that we do everything in our power to make sure that we provide for these two students," Garcia said. "They have lost the privilege to compete at the intercollegiate level but they came here to get their education and degrees. We have put together a comprehensive package to do everything in our power to help them get the resources to graduate. We will honor their scholarships until they graduate."

The conference originally handed down a one-game suspension to the following players, which include seven starters: Michael Alls, Scott Bryant, Roland Clark, Michael Dominguez, John Ellis, Cory Fleming, Reginald Jones, Robert Mitchell, Quintin Newman, Luis Pena, Jarvis Penerton, Julian Reams, Lionell Singleton, Samuel Smith, Mannie Wellington and Chandler Williams.

"After reviewing the film we felt that those where the necessary steps to take," Strock said.

Those suspensions have since become indefinite and all of the players will be referred to FIU's Student Judicial Affairs.

The players will be required to complete 10 hours of anger management counseling, will be placed on athletic probation for the remainder of the academic year and will be required to fulfill 50 hours of community service by educating South Florida youth on the appropriate behavior at athletic competitions.

Garcia also stressed that this may not be the end of the suspensions as tapes are still being reviewed.

The rest of the team and the coaching staff will also be required to complete community service projects.

Garcia went on to add that every FIU student-athlete will be affected somehow by this incident.

"We are going to do what's in our power to make sure that our student athletes in every single sport at FIU behave in an appropriate manner. We are going to use this as part of the orientation for every freshman that comes in here. For us, one incident is one incident too many.

"Every student that comes into this University will be taught what is and isn't acceptable behavior. There are choices in life for everything and there are consequences that you have to accept with these choices."     

The brawl commenced following a scuffle after UM took a 14-0 lead with  nine minutes to play in the third quarter and lasted about five minutes before officials, coaches and officers from the City of Miami Police Department broke up the two teams.

Some fights were also reported among fans.

Headline: Friends of comatose student raise funds for charity
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
For the sisters of the Delta Phi Epsilon sorority, the mission to help those hurt by drunk drivers began when one of their sisters, Molly Orahood, was in a near fatal car accident due to a drunk driver in May. After the accident, Orahood was left with damage to her brain and is currently on the slow road to recovery. 

"Molly was an extremely vibrant and happy person," said Delta Phi Epsilon sister Giselle Gutierrez. "No matter what was wrong she could lift your spirits."

In response to the accident and Orahood's condition, the Delta Phi Epsilon sorority founded an organization called Keep S.O.B.E.R. (Subsidizing Others By Expediting Rehabilitation).

The goal of S.O.B.E.R. is to raise money for those in similar situations as Orahood and to raise awareness of the effects drunk driving has on others.

The first official event of S.O.B.E.R. was a co-venture with the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity called A Night for Molly, a fundraising dinner party held Oct. 13 in the Graham Center Ballroom. 

"We started planning for the event around August," said Melissa Gonzalez, the Delta Phi Epsilon member in charge of the event.  "We plan to do one every year from now on."

"It's amazing how much has been done in such a short time," said Student Government Association President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon.

Jose Torres, a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, thought of A Night for Molly. 

"Originally we were planning something for breast cancer," said Torres. "It just worked its way to being this."

The event was a huge success according to sorority members. Every ticket to the dinner had been sold and special $5 tickets were sold at the door for people who at least wanted to experience the night even if they could not eat. 

"Almost everything was donated," Gonzalez said. "The only things we really had to pay for were the plates and the food which we barely paid a fraction of the normal price for."

According to Gutierrez, the event helped raise between $15,000 and $20,000. The exact amount is not available because some donations were made with credit cards.

There were many on campus organizations that contributed to A Night For Molly including the Waves Spa, Santi's, and SGA. 

"There won't be too many fundraisers done by SGA, [for S.O.B.E.R.] but there will be events to promote awareness," Leon said.

However the night was a bittersweet occasion. 

Spirits were generally high until the tribute video to Orahood was played. During the presentation various photographs and videos of Orahood were shown, including the more graphic ones of her accident and her hospitalization.

Behind the sounds of the music playing one could hear many members of the audience weep. 

"Molly had a great future ahead of her and she might not have it anymore," said Caroline Yera a Delta Phi Epsilon member and close friend of Orahood. "I'm jealous of her brothers that I'm not there with her." 

Yera was the representative for Orahood's brothers in Indiana where she is currently receiving treatment. In a letter, Orahood's brothers expressed feelings of gratitude for those in attendance. They also expressed that as a family, they are still in the grieving process and to them it's like they lost another family member.

When Orahood was 7-years-old, she was in a plane crash that killed both her parents and left her in a coma for six months.

"We just want to continue growing and promote awareness," said Veronica Luna the president of Delta Phi Epsilon. "The support we have received is amazing."

Headline: Experimental theater takes students out of the classroom
Author: Angelina Esposito / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Students at FIU were in for quite a show when nine theater students took over three locations in University Park.

Visiting professor Judy Bauerlein takes her Directing I (TPP3010) class outside of the restrictions of a classroom. In an attempt to teach her students to explore the possibilities of space, she asked them to use already established areas on campus and create a scene around it. The scenes were performed Sept. 27.

The three scenes were adapted from Naomi Iizuka's Polaroid Stories, which has loose roots in Ovid's Metamorphoses. The students took the short scenes and converted them into movement-based pieces with only six lines of dialogue, meaning the story was expressed mostly through body language and their environment.

"I think it's fascinating how we take a moment to see nature and structure from a different point of view," said Jackie Martin, one of the student directors.

The fountain behind the Graham Center, the area around Ramon Lago's statue "Silent Cry" and a small pond behind Deuxieme Maison were the performance spots.

First up was the typical boy-chase-girl scene, directed by student Matt Mur. The boy, played by David Solomon, quietly stalked the girl - Emily Frail - from DM to the fountain where his courtship began. As students watched, the couple flirted in an innocent, childlike manner. The two wove through students and even incorporated a man sitting on a bench - who was reading rather than watching the performance - into the scene. Frail gave the man the flower Solomon had just given her, as a sign of rejection. The scene ended with a monologue by Solomon describing how he loved the girl and traveled through Hell for her but in the end lost her.

The second scene was inspired by several of FIU's artworks including "Silent Cry," Jacques Lipchitz's "Our Tree of Life" and William Tucker's "The Rim." The scene was a composition of images directed by Maritxell Carrero. The girl, played by Toinette Ravelo, shocked students into stopping as they watched her crawl along the ground from one art structure to another. The boy, Jose Grau, in turn surprised everyone as he appeared from "Our Tree of Life," which he used to camouflage himself. The scene implied a sad but romantic connection between the two. 

The third scene used the pond near the Housing Quad. The girl, played by Liz Ferrer, sat at the pond like any other student looking for a quiet place to have lunch. Ferrer began by eating pretzels, and then she hooked a piece onto a paper clip and began to fish. Ferrer - along with those watching - was startled when, from across the lake, another girl-Yamarys Salomon-began to echo her. 

Onlooker Milton Carrero felt it was creative and innovative.

"[The students] created a world within the outside space that they shared with the regular people that walked by," Carrero said, who was present for all three scenes. "It was an innovative thing to be in [the scenes'] world while people [are] in their own world."

At the end of the Fall semester, the directing students' work will be showcased. The date has yet to be announced.

Headline: Student deaths highlight motorcycle dangers
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Within a month, FIU has lost two students to motorcycle fatalities. On Sept. 3, Lance Preston died after his motorcycle hit a concrete wall on the Florida Turnpike and Interstate 595. Then on Sept. 30, prodigy Derek Jacobs passed away when he lost control of his bike, slid across the guard rail and hit a wooden pole.

It's stories and experiences like these that caused junior criminal justice major Anthony Agular to give up his "adrenaline rush," as he likes to call it. 

"Riding a bike in South Florida is horrible. It's very dangerous and it's not worth it," Agular said. "People barely see you when you're in a car, so imagine when you're on a bike."

Despite consistently driving over patches of oil on Pines Boulevard that would cause him to lose control momentarily, the final straw came when Agular was at a red light on Sheridan Street and A1A and a woman in a van hit him from behind knocking him to the ground.

"She said she didn't see me," he said.

That is often the case with most motorcycle accidents: many riders come up fast behind automobiles, and the drivers switching lanes don't often see motorcyclists before it's too late.

In 2005, the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that there were 43,200 deaths on the nation's highways - 4,315 of those deaths were motorcycle related fatalities. This is a 7.7 percent increase from 2004 totals. This is the eighth straight annual increase in motorcycle fatalities.

At age 39, David Williams admits he knows the dangers he will encounter every time he straps on his helmet and takes off on his Suzuki GSX-R600.

He learned firsthand at a young age the risk associated with riding a motorcycle. At age 12, he experienced his first nasty fall and didn't get back onto a bike until he was 37-years-old.

Though he admits that the fastest he has gone is 178 mph. Williams only rides his bike three times a week because he is an expectant father. 

He also said the price drops in gasoline allow him to drive his car to work.

"Most of the time I ride is to clear my mind," said Williams.

Besides the unintentional accidents that occur, riders have to be wary about the occasional desire to race, which can result in a fatal accident. 

Williams remembers one time while on Interstate 75, a BMW M5 started chasing him for no reason just to see if he could keep up with him. His friend who was riding with him at the time was almost knocked down by the BMW during the ordeal.

"I don't understand why people do some of the things they do," he said.

According to the US Department of Transportation, motorcyclists are 16 times more likely to die in an accident than a motor vehicle occupant. 

Despite overwhelming figures and statistics, people still are looking to feed their need for speed.

Thousands of locals will be able to satisfy their interests at the 14th annual "Biketoberfest" that will take place Oct. 19-22 in Daytona Beach.

"People will always ride bikes no matter what," Agular said. "If somebody has been riding long enough, they've most likely been in an accident."

Headline: Starry Nights: Department's 'star parties' help students look to the skies
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
James Webb's office is covered with posters of constellations and colorful individual stars. As he demonstrates the telescopes he uses to teach students, Webb asks eagerly, "Have you ever seen Saturn or Jupiter?" Upon receiving a negative answer, he shakes his head and concludes, "Oh, I feel very sorry for you."

It's this awe for the skies that first led Webb, one of the four astronomy faculty and staff at FIU, to pursue this field as his career. He traces his childhood interest in astronomy back to watching Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon.

"[Then] I happened to see Saturn with its rings, and I was hooked on astronomy," Webb said. "I didn't know you could actually do this for a living. I don't feel like I've worked a day in my life because I'm always doing what I love."

The astronomy department at FIU is technically under the umbrella of the physics department, and there is no astronomy major offered because of lack of faculty and staff. Interested students, however, can still acquire an astronomy minor with their physics major at the undergraduate level, or an astronomy concentration with their physics M.S. at the graduate level.

 Students who may be intrigued by the galaxies, but not enough to study them for a full semester, can attend one of the department's "Star Parties." Orchestrated by Webb, five of these free events are held each semester, and they appeal to anyone who enjoys stargazing. They've been going on for 12 years, and Webb calls them "one of the best kept secrets on campus."

 Several of these parties, such as the ones opening and closing the semester, include refreshments, music and looking through the 12-foot telescope on the observation pad by the Chemistry and Physics building. Others include specific lectures, such as Webb's "Mayan Astronomy" talk on November 3 at 8 p.m. in the Chemistry and Physics building, room 145.

One recent event featured live guitar music, $200 worth of astronomy books raffled off and a discussion on Pluto's recent "demotion" from planetary status.

 Members of the Society of Physics Students, for which Webb is the sponsor, often aid him in putting these evenings together, as well as in other work within the department.     

 Chris Ceron, Vice President of SPS, spoke of hard but rewarding work he did this summer.

 "The job consisted of hours upon hours of going through star images and using a computer program to clean them up," Ceron said. "It can get a bit tedious but … the data you [work] on leads to some pretty cool scientific research."

Being an officer in SPS, he said, has also been worthwhile.

"There is much work involved, but it never feels like a burden," Ceron said. "If anything, my experience with SPS has shown me that there are things in life worth doing that are also enjoyable."

Gregory Azarnia, Senior Physics major and former SPS president, has worked with Webb for the past four years and calls it a "fruitful experience."

"He is … a great mentor [who] really cares about students," Azarnia said.

Azarnia said he first chose to pursue astronomy because of cosmology, the study of the universe.

"For me, astronomy was a catalyst in finding a new way of thinking about the world around me," he said.

One of the department's primary goals in past years has been to acquire funding for an observatory, without which they can never offer an actual astronomy major. In addition, the pad will eventually be displaced by the new medical school building, according to Webb. All universities that teach astronomy, as well as Belen Jesuit Preparatory School, have observatories, and some feel that FIU students are being cheated.

  Walter Van Hamme, chairperson of the physics department and occasional lecturer at the star parties, explained that there is about $22,000 in the bank for this purpose, $17,000 of which was donated by the Student Government Association. However, a total of $500,000 would need to be raised. 

"This is a very small seed," Van Hamme said. "The idea is that we have to raise private funds and the state would match it … It's not because of lack of trying."

"We're always told it's right around the corner and it never is," Webb said.

However, the department affirms it's not giving up anytime soon.

Headline: Students dance night away at Latin Fusion Concert
Author: Ever Cruz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Rafael Zapata, assistant director of campus life, has organized the annual Latin Fusion Explosion Concert every year since it first began eight years ago.

His involvement made the celebrity connection easy: his brother is Nelson Zapata, the founder of Proyecto Uno and one of the night's two musical acts.

"The purpose is to provide entertainment as well as student involvement in organizing the concert," Zapata said.

Every year, Latin Fusion Explosion acts as the grand finale to a number of events held in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month. The concert was held last Friday in the Biscayne Bay Campus' Wolfe University Center ballrooms. 

It was expected to begin at 9 p.m. but the first act didn't start until almost midnight.

The two main performances were Latin dance group Proyecto Uno and merengue artist Fulanito.

Department of Campus Life, Orientation and Recreation made the concert possible providing free concert tickets for FIU students and $5 for general admission.

"It's awesome!  It's about time FIU did something different," said junior Vinny Rodriguez.

The concert itself was motivation enough, but location also had a lot to do with the event's appeal.

"I am glad it's in [BBC], otherwise I would not have been able to go," said senior Roseanne Rollan.

The audience in attendance was comprised of students with dates, parents, friends and even a professor was spotted.

The ballroom was spacious enough for many to dance with out being pushed or bumped by nearby dancers like in a nightclub. 

A huge projection television showing clips of past years' performances and artists acted as decor.

The stage was small but equipped with a sound system so loud students had to shout to communicate with the person next to them - no barrier separating the artist from the audience, just the stage's small platform and the fans.

Performing at the event for the second time, Proyecto Uno took the stage around 11:55 p.m., though the audience was a bit smaller, the remaining fans still became ecstatic when the group performed their set of songs, including their hit, "El Tiburon." The band even recorded footage for an upcoming music video.

In an interview, Proyecto Uno emphasized enjoying oneself while also keeping focus on what's important. 

Nelson's message to the students was "to keep up studying, keep it going, because you're going to see all the fruits [in] the end."

The rest of the band echoed Nelson's advice.

 "What you guys are doing now will pay off in the long run; don't worry about the cool guys partying all the time," Proyecto Uno said.

Appearing at the Latin Fusion Explosion Concert for the third time, Fulanito took the stage around 1 a.m. By then, the ballroom was nearly empty.

The audience left went especially crazy when Fulanito performed their biggest smash, "Guayando." By then, even Rafael Zapata was on the dance floor showing off his best dance routine.

Pickles, a member of the group, said he loves performing for FIU. 

"We'll do something for FIU, all day everyday," he said.

Miami-Dade College student Jessica Roiz has attended the event the last five years in a row and enjoys it every year.

"I come because these artist performing are from my childhood," Roiz said.

Headline: Sailing class relaxing, educating on the high seas

Sophomore Rodrigo Prichard calmly tied down the sails of the boat after bringing it into the dock on a partly-overcast Saturday afternoon.

An avid sailor, he is one of 15 students who is enrolled in the FIU beginner's sailing class.

As he strapped down a tarp over the sails to keep them from taking on too much water, Prichard talked about how he loves being near the water.

"I'm taking this as an elective. I like being out on the water, it's relaxing. I like fishing as well, and I figured I'd take up sailing and kill two birds with one stone," Prichard said.

The class is a physical education course that is part of the health, physical education and recreation program. 

It meets every Saturday from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the South Bayshore Marina, located behind the Coast Guard Hangar next to Coconut Grove.

It is a one credit elective that is sponsored by Shake-A-Leg Academy Miami. 

To sign up for the class, students must pay a $70 extra fee. The class can be taken more than once, and it is open to everyone. 

Experience in sailing is not required to take this class, yet knowing how to swim is recommended, and everyone must wear a life jacket on the boat. 

The final consist of an overnight campout.

The sailing class met Sept. 30 as usual despite the initial gale force winds and stabbing rain.

The class began indoors with a brief demonstration on a dry-erase board by instructors James Hesketh and Ken Korshin. 

They talked about safety maneuvers that should be followed in case a person falls overboard. They also covered docking the four boats, or sloops, the class uses.

"We have to learn how to dock, because eventually we have to come back even if we don't want to," Hesketh said. 

After the wind died down and the rain dissipated, what was learned inside was put into action outside.

Hesketh, Korshin and instructors Tamsin Maund and Rick Poretto showed the students how to properly reach someone who has fallen overboard. 

The procedure involved requires heading the boat into "beam reach," or a point of sail where the boat is headed at a right angle into the wind. Lowering the jib, or the smaller sail, one must "tack" away, or turn the boat towards a sharp left, and then steer towards the person who fell overboard. The procedure seems as if the boat has made a large figure eight towards the person, or in the case of that Saturday, a white buoy, which was scooped up by the students as they came up next to it.

Korshin, who has been sailing for 59 years, remembers the first time his neighbor took him sailing.

"His boat was 140 feet out in the [Long Island] Harbor and I had to swim out to it. The water was cold. We stayed out the whole day. I've been doing it ever since," he said. 

 Hesketh, shares a similar love for sailing with his dog, a 14-year-old golden retriever, Morley, who is his faithful first-mate on the boat. "I hitchhiked to Miami in 1980 [and] started sailing in 1993. [I] haven't stopped [and] have no plans to leave," he said. Yeleny Suarez, journalism major and alumna took the course two years ago.

 "Ken is fabulous. I was a credit short, so I looked in the book and took the class," Suarez said. "These people, it's their passion. They're dedicated volunteers who don't even get paid, and it's great. I came in three weeks late and Ken was kind enough to let me in."

Suarez was apprehensive at first when she realized the terminology she would have to memorize, among other things.

"Looking at the text book, I was like what the f---, but then once I got on the boat I got what the keel was and the jib," she said.

After taking the class, Suarez said she would recommend the class to all people.

 "It's sad kids don't know about it. This is something Miamians could definitely use," Suarez said.
