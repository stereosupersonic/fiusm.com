&nbsp;
The FIU lady Golden Panthers lost 3-1 in a Sun Belt Conference match up against the lady Trojans of Arkansas-Little Rock on Sept. 25 at the Trojan Fieldhouse in Little Rock, Arkansas.

 The young FIU team put together this summer dropped to 1-10 this season and 0-2 in Sun Belt Conference play. The Trojans improved to 7-5 (1-0, Sun Belt). 

Coach Cookie Stevens says she knows her team has had troubles against Sun Belt opponents. 

"Through two conferences opponents we have been struggling," said Stevens.

Junior Anna Dmowska finished with 16 kills to lead the Golden Panthers. Freshmen Alyse Santisi and Dyionna Smith added another 15 and 13 digs, respectively.

Set one of the match was a back and forth battle that was eventually won by the Trojans 30-28, but not before a total of four lead changes and eight tie scores. FIU managed to tie the score at one by winning the second set 30-27 in a set that featured nine ties and three lead changes. 

Freshman Ruth Fleming and sophomore Oksana Zabalueva led FIU during the set by finishing with five and four kills, respectively. 

Dyionna Smith added seven digs and seven assists during the set. Set three was a 30-21 win for the Trojans; however Dmowska added five kills for FIU. Game four, the clincher for the lady Trojans, was another dominant 30-19 victory.

With a new group of players, part of the Golden Panthers struggle has been chemistry. Stevens is confident the players will come together.

"We have not found a group of players but in this game [against the Trojans], we did find a group of players connecting but we need to finish games," Stevens said.

Stevens says doesn't want to hear excuses anymore.

"A new group of players takes a while to get on the same page but we have no excuses anymore. We need to get it done," Stevens said. "Stamina and resistance will get it done."

The lady Golden Panthers return home on Oct. 3rd for a match against another Sun Belt Conference foe South Alabama. The match will take place at noon at Pharmed Arena.

Headline: Week four, only one game? Ridiculous!
Author: By Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Five weeks into the NCAA football season the Golden Panthers have seen a cancellation, a postponement, a bye week and plenty of natural disasters. What FIU hasn't seen is a lot of football. 

Before the originally scheduled home opener against Jacksonville University, Head Coach Don Strock worried that with the NCAA cutting back on two-a-day practices, his team may not have yet been in football shape. That game never happened. Neither did a second attempt at a home-opener as last week's Western Kentucky match-up was rescheduled for Nov. 20th. 

After Hurricanes Charlie, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, what we have left is perhaps the only team in the nation that played just one game in the month of September, getting ready to host a Division I-A football team for the very first time. 

Moreover, a Sun-Belt Conference opponent that's almost halfway through its regular season in Louisiana-Lafayette. 

Rest is usually a good thing in a sport as violent and overall physically demanding as football, but too much of anything can be harmful. There are still questions to be answered about this team; questions that can only be answered on the football field during game-time situations. 

The offensive line, for example, still need to prove it can consistently protect Josh Padrick and open running lanes for Rashod Smith and Adam Gorman. The unit played well at YSU and did not give up a sack. Yet, the Penguins defensive line was severely undersized and not as quick as advertised. Louisiana-Lafayette's D-line will pose a bigger challenge, anchored by 6-4, 305-pound senior defensive tackle, Ken Haynes. 

While the Golden Panther's defense looked improved in the one game played so far, its still remains to be seen exactly how much better they are compared to the past two years. Questions remain as to whether they can consistently stop the run. 

We may have more answers to these questions after Saturday's game, but at least we'll finally have more football.

Headline: Football to square off against Cajuns
Author: By Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers will make a third attempt at a home opener as the I-A Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns (2-2) visit FIU Stadium for the first time on Oct. 2. 

FIU was scheduled to open the season at home on Sept. 2, but Hurricane Frances forced a cancellation and the Jacksonville Dolphins could not reschedule. 

The game against Western Kentucky, originally scheduled for Sept. 25th, would have been the first game played at FIU stadium this season but Hurricane Jeanne thwarted WKU's travel plans and that game was postponed until Nov. 20.

This will be the second time FIU faces Louisiana-Lafayette, with the Cajuns leading the series 1-0. The previous game was an ugly 43-10 ULL win on Nov. 8, 2003 at Cajun Field. The Golden Panthers gave up a total of 443 yards in that game including 236 yards on the ground. The most disturbing part was that no one particular ball carrier managed the bulk of the yardage. 

Instead, Cajuns Offensive Coordinator Rob Christophel used a revolving backfield of running backs Josh Harrison (63 yards), Chester Johnson (53), Dwight Lindon (32) and quarterback Jerry Babb (47) to distribute most of the ground game against an ineffective FIU run-defense.

Babb is in his second year under center for ULL and is averaging 203 yards through four games this season. The sophomore has totaled 814 yards and five touchdowns on the air, but the Golden Panthers will have to respect his legs as much as his arm. The 6-3, 215lb. scrambler currently leads the Cajuns in rushing yards (219) and touchdowns (3). He's also thrown five interceptions, which means with pressure at the line of scrimmage, he can be forced to make mistakes. 

Despite losing both starting wide receivers in the off-season, ULL's receiving corps is loaded with experienced seniors. Bill Sampy has been Babb's favorite target this year along with fellow seniors B.J. Christ and Kemmie Lewis close behind. Red-shirted freshman Jordan Jackson stands at 6-feet-6-inches and 200lbs., a load for any defensive back. 

Head Coach Don Strock was confident last week because after all, FIU can't control the weather.

"We can't control Mother Nature. It's disappointing and it puts us back a bit but we've already started preparing for Louisiana-Lafayette, so we should be ready to go," said Strock.

Under new coordinator Tiger Clark, the FIU defensive unit appears to be much improved. The main concern is the lack of experience the Golden Panthers have had this year with only one game under its belt where most teams have played four. 

The bye week followed by the rescheduling of WKU means FIU hasn't played at game since Sept. 11. This game now serves as the measuring stick Western Kentucky was supposed to be in providing an idea of how far the program has come since last season.   

The Cajuns were ranked last in total defense in the Sun-Belt Conference last year. As a result, they've switched from a multiple eight-man front to a multiple 4-3 formation.

This strengthens their secondary while making them slightly more susceptible to the run. Offensively, the Golden Panthers will need to run the ball well. ULL has given up an average of 243 yards on the ground per game. If running backs Rashod Smith and Adam Gorman can be successful, it should open up the passing game for Josh Padrick. 

Padrick will probably look for his new starting tight end, Samuel Smith quite a few times this game. Smith set a school record with ten receptions at Youngstown State and makes a great compliment to wide-outs Harold Leath and Corey McKinney.

As always, protecting the football will be a key component to winning. A plethora of second quarter turnovers allowed the Cajuns to come away with 29 points in the quarter en route to a 36-7 halftime lead last year. 

The team went through extensive practices last week for Western Kentucky and shifting strategies towards the Ragin Cajun changed some of the game plan.

"It's tough, but we got good preparation during last week. [Louisiana-Lafayette] is a little different than Western Kentucky, but I'm sure we'll be fine," Strock said.

FIU killed several birds with one stone against YSU, winning for the first time on the road, in over time and against a Gateway conference opponent. A first win against a Division I-A program would be a very nice addition to that trend.

&nbsp;
Just two days after a tough loss against Florida Atlantic University, the Golden Panthers were able to bounce back to a 6-0 win over New Jersey Tech  on Sept. 24.

The Panthers recorded their first shutout of the season and improved to 3-3-0, while the Highlanders dropped to 0-8-0. FIU scored early on their way to controlling and dominating the game. The Golden Panthers pounded the first year Division I-A opponent. 

"We created some chances, moved the ball better and I'm happy to get the conference win. This lifts everyone's spirits after a tough loss to FAU," said coach Karl Kremser who was glad to get his team back on track.

Senior Fernando Plentz got things started for FIU in the 2nd minute as he found the back of the net on a penalty kick. 

He was excited that his play, along with that of his teammates was much improved following the loss to the Owls.

 "Everybody came hard and ready to play and what was missing against FAU happened now," said Plentz. 

David Hope then added to the lead when he took a pass from Edgard Correa and recorded his first goal of the season in the 32nd minute.

The Golden Panthers extended their lead going into halftime to 3-0 after senior Oscar Gil, knocked in his first goal of the season on a pass from St. John transfer Jean Camere.

FIU out shot the Highlanders 16-1 in the first half and held a 6-1 advantage in corner kicks.

Plentz and Hope both went on to record their first career multi-goal games in the win, each recording two goals. 

Hope added to the excitement when he delivered a difficult header off of a corner kick from Gil in the 62nd minute. Plentz scored his team leading fourth goal of the season.

Sophomore goalkeeper Shawn Crowe recorded his first shutout of the season in 75:36 as he faced no shots on goal. 

Freshman Andres Arguello saw his first action of the season and recorded one save.

Once again FIU controlled the second half out shooting New Jersey Tech 10-1.

The Golden Panthers return to action on Oct. 3 at 7:00 p.m. against the University of South Florida.

Headline: Lack of help plagues student
Author: Cesar Gutierrez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Should students from overseas consider FIU to complete their education? Maybe they should think about it twice.

Not only do we have to pay quite a bit of money ($514 per credit), but by immigration laws we must enrolled full time, meaning we need to take 12 credits per semester ($6, 384) ,plus buy a medical insurance that costs nearly a $1,000 per year. In addition, there is rent, food, gas and don't forget books. By the way, we aren't allowed to work.

But, that's okay. What's discouraging is the unwillingness of FIU's different departments to help international students when it comes to us asking for assistance. Whether it is either professors' refusal to give us an override so we can meet the number of credits immigration demands, or the International Student Department's refusal to make an exception  to not report us because we aren't enrolled fulltime thanks to FIU's lack of organization.

For instance, for this term my online appointment to register was on Aug. 10 at 11 a.m. Knowing that a minute can be vital to getting the last seat in a class, I was careful to be on time in front of my laptop to enroll for classes.

Oh, surprise! When I got the last class in the list my advisor had given me two months before the computer kept saying "Error found." In plain English that meant that the class was already full. It didn't make sense to me. I had been on time to my appointment. I thought that if FIU gave a set time to enroll, it knew how many students were going to take the class.

Immediately, I started calling the advising office to talk to my advisor, but as every student knows, no one ever answers the phone. Then, I went to the office looking for some advice. However, neither the advisor nor her bosses knew what I could do.

I decided to go to the International Student Department to explain what happened. They suggested that I take another class. But since I'm in my last year, the classes that I was trying to take were the only ones I needed to register.		     After a few minutes of going back and forth, they told me they could do nothing and that I knew that if I didn't enroll fulltime my student visa would be suspended. I didn't understand why they would not help me. I had done nothing wrong. I wasn't my fault that for the time my appointment had been scheduled, the class had already been full. Frustrated as I was, I asked them to write a letter explaining the situation so I could show the professor proof that I desperately needed an override for that class.

To my dismay, after explaining myself and showing proof to the professor, his response was a definite "no". To him it didn't matter that I didn't have any other classes I could take, or the fact that not taking that class meant my graduation would be delayed. Or, hey! If I didn't register for that class, my status as an international student would be taken away and that all the money and time invested in my education was at risk. All he could do was suggest that I to take any other class. Gee, thank you! I guess for him $1,542 is just loose change.

After many tries, I finally enrolled in the class. Now, I'm meeting all the requirements FIU and immigration stipulates. However, I still don't understand the professor's refusal to give me the override. Half of the class is empty and it's not even a core class. It is just one of those classes that's a requirement.

FIU should have a better idea of just how many students can register for each class, and the amount of international students that need to, by law, enroll in classes. Or if that is too difficult, FIU could be more flexible with its rules. Maybe we should not have an appointment to register. It rather be on first come, first served basis. Then, if we don't register on time, it would really be our fault.

Headline: Breaking solar ground
Author: Harry Coleman / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
The FIU community along with sponsors and supporters from the Miami community celebrated a milestone in the construction of an 800-square foot solar-powered house as part of the 2005 Solar Decathlon. 

"It is an ambitious project...the team seems to be able to get a lot done in a short period of time and do very good work in the process," said Ryan Moreno, a fellow mechanical engineering graduate student and Ph.D. candidate. "The team has a good design and I see them placing very high [in the competition].

On Sept. 24, the College of Engineering held a groundbreaking in which President Modesto A. Maidique, along with team members, sponsors, and college dean's, set the first cornerstone for the solar-powered house to be built on the East Lawn of the Engineering Center. 

"This is the first participant team to have a groundbreaking and what it does is help to keep our sponsors engaged so they think there is a sense of something really happening," Nathaniel Q. Belcher, faculty advisor and architectural professor, said. "The spirit of this is that it is a student run project and people see that when they come [to the groundbreaking]."

The groundbreaking, which represents a year's worth of work and dedication by students and faculty members from across the disciplines, has team members feeling that they are headed in the right direction.

"I feel that it's a very important milestone in the competition...it gives us a chance to feel that we have accomplished something and it gives us a chance to show the community what we have done. We have some models, a plan and a direction we are going in," engineering team leader Edward Natsui said. "We have a lot of work yet to do, but once the details are worked out, and we get to [Washington], we will prove that we have a lot of potential."

As part of the Solar Decathlon, FIU students and faculty will compete against 18 teams in ten contests over ten days. The event itself, which started in the spring of 2003, challenges students to build a completely solar-powered house that is not only livable but energy efficient. 

"The team wants to establish FIU, our school of architecture and our school of engineering as forerunners in the advancement of design and research technology,"  said project manager and student leader Joshua Freese. "We want to create an innovative, sustainable design that represents [FIU and Miami] as a microcosm of the global community by uniting a vast array of students and professors to research, design and build tomorrow's solar home."

According to Richard J. King, the director and creator of the Solar Decathlon from the U.S. Department of Energy [DOE], the Solar Decathlon prompts students to work together  in a competition which he hopes will have an impact as global as the Solar Decathlons' participants.

"FIU will do excellent. They've got to finish the house but on paper they look like a very strong contender. It is a tremendous opportunity for the school and the university and [the DOE] is excited to have [sunny] Florida represented in the Solar Decathlon," King said. [The project] really has the vision of the future...some day the oil will run out and we will have to make due with the good old sun." 

Working alongside the School of Architecture and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, students from the College of Engineering will complete the two-year project in the fall of 2005. In order to reach the final step of the event, the FIU team must build the house in Miami, take it apart and load it onto a tractor-trailer in route to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. 

Once there, students must rebuild the house in seven days thus creating what the DOE, the event's main sponsor, has nicknamed the "Solar Village." 

"This is a competition where everybody wins. You show up; you've got a house...the students have learned and if they have a failure, that's some of the best experiences learned," King said. "It will be a historic event on the [National Mall]...there has never been anywhere in the U.S. an entire Solar Village built." 

During the 21-day event, local visitors, congressman and senators will join the countless Solar Decathlon judges as they evaluate the 19 houses and determine the most suitable design, build and energy efficient house on display. 

The winner, to be determined at a date not yet set by the DOE, will be the team that best combines the conveniences and style of a modern home with the energy needs of daily life. 

Despite the enormous challenge of finding funding and acquiring the resources needed to build the house, team members are confident that the house will get built. 

"It has actually been a pretty smooth ride. To get where we are today is amazing. When we started...we didn't think it could happen. Of course, there is always something that we need but we are off to a good start," the team's post-student and School of Architecture representative Jordan Trachtenberg said. 

While the planning, research and building of the house seems overwhelming to some of the over 300 students working on the project, many say the outcome is worth the effort.

"During a project like this you interact with so many people that you begin to make connections and establish yourself as a leader not only in the project but also in your profession.  [The project] is a really good predecessor for your career," Freese said.

"It's a big project and it's something that really spoke to me... it is something I wanted to do," Natsui added. "We have had a lot of students come and go but it is something I think is very good for society, mankind and everything in general."

Although the FIU team is up against competitors from Cornell University, the University of Michigan and the University of Texas at Austin, event organizers feel that the Solar Decathlon is set to show the world that solar energy is a viable resource that is becoming vastly more important.

"This event will do a tremendous amount to prove that solar energy really works and that energy efficiency pays off," King said. "It's a wonderful educational project and no matter where [the teams] place they will all get something very valuable out of this experience."

Headline: Aid workers warn of epidemics from Haitian flooding
Author: By Mamie Ward and Michael A.W. Ottey / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
The trail of homeless Haitians left by Hurricane Jeanne  earlier this week huddled under tarps and scrambled for food earlier as relief workers warned of epidemics from floodwaters made fetid by the bodies of human and animal victims.

According to the latest statistics, at least 1,113 people were confirmed dead and 1,251 remained missing, mostly in the northern port city of Gonaives, while more than 900 were treated for injuries and 300,000 were homeless.

About 30,000 children under the age of 5 also have been affected, some of them orphaned when Jeanne killed their parents and many of their siblings.UNICEF will dispatch 30 staff members to find orphans and provide them with support and counseling.

Argentina sent two cargo aircraft with food, water and medical supplies, and the Red Cross was sending four more carrying blankets, plastic sheeting, water purification equipment and cooking utensils from Panama, Canada, France and Spain.

But the planes were landing in Port-au-Prince, a six- to eight-hour drive from Gonaives on roads cut at several places by floodwaters and mudslides unleashed by Jeanne when it struck Haiti on Saturday. 

The few clinics in the city are being manned by doctors from Medicins San Frontieres and Medicins Du Monde, two French-based volunteer organizations, 14 Cuban doctors and Argentine military officers.

New mass graves were dug Thursday at a Gonaives cemetery to dispose of the stacks of bloated bodies that have accumulated in the city's three morgues.

But relief officials said their prime concern was delivering food and potable water to about 300,000 Haitians who have had little of either in the past five days.

The U.N. World Food Program delivered 71-½ tons of food to Gonaives, and peacekeeping officials said they had reports that some families are managing to cook rice on their rooftops while staying out of the floodwaters below.

Scuffles broke out among Haitians as relief workers tried to distribute emergency supplies in Gonaives, and police reported overnight shootings by property owners trying to fend off looters.

"In terms of the security situation, it has not been controlled yet," Fritz Fougy, deputy chief of mission at the Haitian Embassy in Washington, D.C., told The Miami Herald. "As for the distribution of food, it's been known that people are very hungry and these things could happen."

After days of complaints about the meager $60,000 in U.S. emergency assistance to the island nation, the Agency for International Development announced Thursday that it will provide an additional $2 million in aid to help flood victims in Haiti.

"The administration has now promised significant aid to Haiti. However, it does sadden me that the United States, as leader of the free world, took so long to come to the plate," said Rep. Kendrick B. Meek, D-Fla.

Aristide issued a statement from exile in South Africa mourning the deaths in Haiti, which is celebrating its bicentennial anniversary of its independence from France.

"Condolences and courage to an entire nation that has seen much pain and suffering in this tumultuous bicentennial year," Aristide said. "We continue to stand in solidarity with all Haitians who suffer."

Headline: UP career fair set to help students find right jobs
Author: By Evelyn Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Get your resume, portfolio, and business attire ready because the Fall Career and Internship fair is here.

All FIU students and alumni are urged to attend the free fair on Monday, Oct. 4 from 10 a.m.- 3 p.m at the University Park Campus.

The fair, organized by Career Services, usually features 150 through 165 companies and 1,500 - 2,000 students who come together to meet, interact, and make professional connections.

The purpose of the career fair is to network your way to a job, according to Dulce Ramirez Damon, fair coordinator and assistant director of career services.

"The event allows the students to gather information regarding the company, sign-up for on-campus interviews if the company has scheduled them, find out about current job openings and simply network with companies that may interest them," says Damon.

Although the fair does not guarantee that you will get a job on the spot, students can land jobs or internships as a result of the networking and follow-ups made on the student's part, she says.

In addition, certain companies offer on-campus interviews that take place shortly after the fair. To take part in these supplementary interviews students must purchase Golden Panther Services. It costs $20 and should be purchased prior to attending the fair.

Purchasing Golden Panther Services gives students access to FIU's online interviewing system, Pantherlink. Pantherlink allows students to view positions and submit their resumes online.

However, Golden Panther Services is not mandatory. 

Students and alumni are encouraged to attend the fair and gain the experience of meeting with potential employers and practice their networking and interviewing skills.

For those students unsure of what supplies to take, Damon advices on several important choices. "I can list a lot of things...proper attire, professional demeanor, resume...But I think the single thing that will give you a competitive edge is confidence!"

For more information regarding the fair, go to www.fiu.edu/~career/student/fairs, or call (305) 348-2423.

Headline: President Uribe to address local Colombian community
Author: By Cesar Gutierrez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Alvaro Uribe Velez, president of Colombia since 2002, will be at the University Park's Wertheim Performing Art's Center on Sept. 30 to discuss issues affecting the South Florida Colombian population.

According to Victor Uribe, director of FIU's Colombian Studies Institute, the president's visit will offer Colombian citizens residing in the area a venue for the discussion of many important issues relevant to their community. Colombia, which for the past four decades has been engaged in a civil war between Marxist guerillas and a succession of conservative governments, has experienced such an economic slump and an increase in kidnappings that many citizens have chosen to leave their country. South Florida has, for the most part, the greatest concentration of expatriates.

"It will be a sort of 'Town Hall meeting' where people will be able to ask the president about different problems ranging from migratory issues, trade, the validation of degrees, money transfers, the new ID cards for Colombians living in the USA, the payment of social security coverage in Colombia from the USA and so forth," Victor Uribe said. The institute's director also says that the public can expect the president's visit to answer a list of specific questions for the future consideration of Colombian officials, with a chance for Colombians living abroad to interact with their president. 

"In addition, by hosting Uribe's visit, FIU intends to let Colombians and the media know about the Colombian Studies Institute which is dedicated to the study of that nation's economic, social, political and cultural issues," said Victor Uribe.

Participants will include Colombian  groups, professors, elected city officials and students. Anyone wishing to attend may receive free tickets at the Latin American and Caribbean Center in UP, DM building, room 353. Although the event will begin at 9:30 a.m., students are adviced to arrive early due to security measures.

Sponsors include the Colombian Embassy in Washington, the Miami Colombian Consulate, the Latin American and Caribbean Center, the Colombian Studies Institute and the Colombian Students Association at FIU.

Headline: Convocation to honor faculty
Author: By Adriana Pereira / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This week FIU's faculty members, who have sometimes been forgotten in the crowds of students, are running the show.    

Friday, the Tenth Annual Faculty Convocation will bring Faculty Convocation Week to a close, assembling FIU's finest scholars and recognizing their efforts. The event will feature keynote speaker Dr. Jordan J. Cohen, President of the Association of American Medical Colleges.

"The faculty are quite curious about medical education and that is our next big major effort. There should be a discussion of that sort and there is no one better to lead it than him," Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive Vice President of Academic Affairs said.    

The week has focused on gathering faculty together to promote discussion of the university's future and its current strengths and weaknesses. It also has given the professors a chance to compare FIU to other urban research universities.

Rosenberg says this week allows faculty members to step back and be more contemplative about the university and their own careers and it gives them the opportunity to honor those who deserve recognition.     

The largest event of the week will take place on Fri., Oct. 1, when 30 faculty members, selected by a committee comprised of one member from each college, will be honored at the Faculty Convocation.  

"Recognition of faculty is key in what we do," Dr. James Sutton, faculty convocation chairperson and English professor, said.

Twelve undergraduate teaching awards will be given along with 11 for research, two for service, one for advising, one for librarianship and three for adjunct professors.  

Among the winners stand political science Professor Astrid Arraras, who will be given an award for teaching. 

"I feel very honored for receiving such a prestigious award at a very early stage in my career," she said.

Religious studies professor and associate dean of the Honors College, Lesley Northup is also being recognized for her service to FIU and the community.

"The truth is that many, many of our faculty deserve awards for their service to the university and the wider community," Northup said. "To be honored for service is really just to be one of the lucky few who represent many others."  

The most prestigious honor being given is the Council of 100, Outstanding Faculty Award that brings with it a $10,000 cash prize. The winner has been selected by FIU President Modesto Maidique, Provost Mark Rosenberg and the Council of 100 and has been FIU's best kept secret of the week. No one, with the exception of this selection committee, knows who the winner will be.  

Aside from the award ceremony, faculty will hear the thoughts of Cohen, who has been chosen as keynote speaker and is expected to offer his perspective on FIU's pursuit of a public medical school. 

The university submitted its proposal for the school to the Florida Board of Governors in July.    

"Dr. Cohen's address is certainly of central relevance as we continue to refine and develop our medical school initiative,"  Bruce Hauptli Faculty Senate chairperson said. "I am confident that the faculty will find his remarks instructive."

Hauptli, who serves on the Faculty Convocation Week committee, says the opportunity to reflect on this major initiative is an important aspect of this year's Convocation. Apart from the many other purposes of the week, the faculty have focused all week on discussing the medical school initiative and what it means to the university's future.

Many of the faculty are aware of the importance of a medical school and are supportive of the idea.

"I believe FIU faculty feel that the medical initiative is a natural step in our evolution to becoming a top urban research university," Hauptli said.  

The university faculty members are not the only ones with an opinion on the medical school proposal. Students have also had plenty to say and are being encouraged to take an active role in the discussion by attending Convocation on Friday and listening in to Cohen's perspective.    

Representing the student body at the event will be University Park Student Government President Jorge Rosario and Biscayne Bay Campus President Ruth-Allyson Webster, who will both take part in the procession and will be seated alongside faculty members. 

"We will be there to show that the student body supports the faculty," Rosario said. He encourages students to attend the Convocation because he believes it will serve as a great opportunity to network and meet the deans of each college and the university's vice presidents.  It will also allow students to interact with professors beyond the typical classroom setting.     

 FIU students are known  for voicing their opinions and being involved.  Sutton says that students play an important role in the decisions made at the university and they have a place in faculty life. 

This is why Sutton  encourages them to attend the Convocation: to listen in on the medical school talk and pay tribute to their professors.

"I do this because events like these are very important," Sutton said.

This is his third year chairing the committee. He has been working with 16 other faculty and staff  members since January to successfully put on this event.

"Convocation creates tradition and consistency in FIU and it's an important reason to take a break from the grind of university life," stresses Sutton.

Though the events increase as the years go by, Sutton also states how Convocation is only made possible with the help of many sectors, including the Office of the Provost, the Graham Center staff and University Publications.

On Monday, The Honors College kicked off the week with its Parade of Nations and States and the Honors Convocation. 

At the Honors College events  students play their biggest role in Faculty Convocation Week.    

Other events included a Tenure and Promotion Reception, a folk concert and the Provost's Dinner. On Tuesday, the Biscayne Bay Campus hosted the first of the two Convocations at which Carolyn Roberts, chair of the Florida Board of Governors, spoke about the challenges facing Florida's urban universities.  

Organizers say Convocation will be a success if the 450 seats in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center are filled with faculty.

"I find it frustrating that some faculty blow off Convocation as unimportant or tiresome," Northup said. "I suspect the ones who do that are the ones who have never gone and seen how much Convocation can do to build community and remind us why we're proud to be FIU faculty."

Headline: "Shaun of the Dead:" Romance, comedy, zombies; what more could one ask for?
Author: Jose Aparicio / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In 1979, George Romero came out with the B-movie cult classic "Dawn of the Dead."  While "Dawn of the Dead" might not appeal to everyone, it did inspire a cult following. 

Shaun (Simon Pegg), writer and main character, and Edgar Wright, writer and director, are two people greatly influenced by Romero's creation. 

And in their homage to Romero, they have created a movie that can appeal to a much wider fan base than the original. 

Shaun is a 29-year-old appliance store senior clerk. He trudges around in his daily life much like the undead. 

His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is fed up with Shaun's lack of creativity in their dating life. He is always going to the local pub, the Winchester, with his best friend Ed (Nick Frost) and makes little effort to romance Liz.

In all his misery and hung-over glory, Shaun hardly notices what the local news is calling "Z-day." 

Sitting on his couch with  Ed, flipping through the news Shaun doesn't  realize that London is being taken over by zombies until the hapless pair stumble upon what they at first think is a drunk girl in their garden. 

Finally wise to what is happening to the local London neighborhood (and indeed the world), they must come up with a plan. The plan being, of course, to save their loved ones and head to a sanctuary (where Ed insists he must be able to smoke) which is, of course, the Winchester. Shaun and Ed head off to rescue Shaun's mom, Barbara (Penelope Wilton), his step-father, Philip (Bill Nighy),  Liz and her two flat mates. 

Along the way they smash their car into zombies, at times stopping to make sure their victim is indeed a zombie,  not some poor innocent bystander. 

Now, I have always thought of a zombie coming to bite me and eating my bowls while groaning like someone with a bad hangover and three hours of sleep, as somewhat comical.  It's not something that at first thought really sounds like it could be that terrifying. But by metaphorically suggesting that we are all going about our lives as zombies, this movie does a spectacular job of playing off that premise. 

Of course it's all fun and games until there are too many of them around to be outrun, and then someone gets disemboweled and their innards become a scrumptious buffet for all the ravenous undead. 

This is a satire that becomes its own driving force. It even has Romero's seal of approval. At times the comedy is so much you almost forget that it is also a horror movie. Especially when it uses all the horrot to help Shaun put the groove back into his relationship with Liz.

I would have to say that this might be the funniest movie of the year. 

As the tag line says, "A romantic comedy. With zombies." I think another way to look at it as a  romantic dramedy with guts. And again, no pun intended.

Headline: Stewart's 'Daily' genius on display in new book
Author: David Hinckley / New York Daily News
&nbsp;
Despite his occupation, Jon Stewart says he doesn't instinctively see all world events as slightly absurd jokes just sitting there waiting to be told. 

"Sadly, I tend to take everything pretty seriously," says Stewart, host of Comedy Central's topical satire, "The Daily Show." 

"We spend most of our time trying to take things that aren't very pleasant and turn them into something playful and entertaining." 

It seems to be working. Stewart and "The Daily Show" walked off with Emmy awards Sunday for Best Comedy or Variety Show and Best Writing - both for the second year in a row. 

Emmy Awards lately have been migrating from broadcast to cable shows, leading to the widespread suggestion that cable's comparative lack of content restrictions has fostered a higher level of creativity. Stewart isn't buying it, at least with "The Daily Show." 

"I sort of think that if you analyze our show, we'd fit within FCC limits," he says. "We're not out to get publicity by exposing our right teat. We're just trying to do the funniest show we can. 

"At 8 o'clock on network TV, you can watch girls in bikinis eating mealworms. By that standard, we're good." 

"The Daily Show" can, however, lob the occasional crudity when it fits the joke, and its writing team takes that same liberty in its first book, "America" (Warner Books), which grafts the TV show's tone of straight-faced absurdity onto a textbook about the country. 

It's hard to miss the page that shows the nine Supreme Court justices naked, but the general tone of the book is more verbal satire than slash-and-burn. 

"The Republican party is the party of nostalgia," reads one passage. "It seeks to return America to a simpler, more innocent and moral past that never actually existed. The Democrats are utopians. They seek to create an America so fair and non-judgmental that life becomes an unbearable series of apologies." 

While "The Daily Show" is sometimes characterized as tilting left - John Kerry dropped in after he got the Democratic presidential nomination - Stewart says the premise isn't partisan. 

If many of the shots land on Republicans, that's largely because Republicans hold many of the power positions. 

But with another set of Emmys, attention must be paid, Stewart said backstage after the ceremony. 

"I think we're kingmakers, it's clear," he said. "I would not be surprised if, in this election, tens of people change their votes."

All politicians who appear on the show, he notes, realize they will probably be part of some joke. And, no, he's not surprised many of them do it anyway. 

"They realize we respect the process," theorizes Stewart. "But also, politicians are salespeople and we're another place they can slap a campaign ad." 

Dating back at least to Richard Nixon's "Laugh-In" cameo of 1968, some politicians have also felt that appearing on a comedy show can humanize their image. Stewart agrees, though his perspective is a little different. 

"Sometimes you hit a moment that gives you hope there's a real person there," he says. "Maybe it's just a fleeting instant when something darts across the back of their eyes. But you hope that person someday will win out." 

Stewart, who turns 43 in November and became a dad for the first time this summer, started with "The Daily Show" in 1999 and is signed through 2008. The show's four-day-a-week schedule is "just right," he says, to keep its creativity fresh. And in his spare time? 

"Bikinis and mealworms," he says. "That's what I do."

Headline: Ben Folds: Super D
Subheadline: Folds' new EP, final installment for full-length album
Author: Sue Arrowsmith / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For rocker Ben Folds, his latest EP, Super D, is a personal affair.  Even his wife, Frally Hayes, makes the cover as she appears sprawled on the hood of a 1964 Buick Electra.  The widely anticipated EP, the final of a trilogy, was released last month and is only available on the internet.  A full-length album including the two previous installments, Speed Graphic and Sunny 16, is expected for release in early 2005.  

The release of the album has been delayed due to his collaboration as co-writer and producer on "Has Been," William Shatner's upcoming album. (That's right. You read correctly).  

Folds mentioned that he chose to market the EP on the internet to prevent Big Media control and to deliver the music directly to his fans without the high prices.  In the competitive, market-driven music business Folds' self-promotion is as admirable as his musical stylings though it does not promise to make him a huge star.  Super D, like most of his other contributions to the music world, will not sit well with mainstream music, but Folds and his faithful fans don't seem like they will mind.  

Three of the five songs on the EP are originals.  "Kalamazoo" showcases his silky piano playing and skills with the strings and is easily the best of the three.  In this particular song it is obvious why some people compare him to Billy Joel. Folds has an honest way of presenting music; he pays attention to mundane things some of us might overlook. 

 "Rent a Cop," a song about a security guard whispering nasty things to young girls at a mall, has that sort of insight.  He wrote his other song, "Adelaide," right before catching a flight to Adelaide in Australia where he now lives.  The song is a deep admiration of his home.         

Unfortunately, the best song on the EP is not an original. It's a cover of The Darkness' "Get Your Hands Off My Woman," which Folds endearingly calls, "heavy metal on piano." There is also a moving live rendition of the Ray Charles tune "Them That Got."  About two minutes into the song he abruptly stops and casually tells the audience that he doesn't know the rest of the song. "Maybe one day I'll learn the rest," he says.

On Super D, Folds juggles the roles of song-writer and producer.  He also plays piano, bass and drums on some of the tracks, earning him a solid place in the rare world of serious musicians.  

Like fellow rocker Tori Amos, whom he toured with in 2003, he has mastered the art of piano rock. 

With songs that can easily begin as blue-like ballads and suddenly slip into funky beats somewhere along the way, it is difficult to classify his music. 

While some tend to over analyze Folds' style, others simply accept it.

Headline: 21st international book fair makes way
Author: Shane Howard / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For all the cynics out there who think Americans are reading less and less, it is obvious they have yet to visit the Miami Book Fair.

The Miami Book Fair International in its 21st installment will set up shop at Miami Dade College's Wolfson Campus in downtown Miami from Nov. 7-14. The week-long event, free and open to the public, will conclude with its street fair the weekend of Nov. 12-14. 

"Tons of local people have been invited who are writing a bit about everything: Holocaust education, Florida election politics, New South Florida cuisine, family issues, plus fiction and poetry," said Lisa Palley of Palley Promotes. Palley handles the public relations for the fair as well as the film festival.

The highlight of the fair, Congress of Authors, takes place all day Saturday and Sunday. Over 300 authors will have panel discussions and readings. There is also a segment called The Evenings With ...  that allows readers to spend an evening with one of their favorite authors.

First known as Books by the Bay in 1984, the two-day fair has evolved into the largest and finest book fair in America. Attracting more than 500,000 literature fans every year, the fair enables both readers and writers to come together. Readers can listen to authors' new work, participate in personal, question and answer sessions, or get authors to autograph their work.

The Street Fair offers outdoor exhibits by nearly 300 national and international booksellers and publishers, plus author presentations. 

An interactive environment known as Children's Alley allows young readers to join the festivities, while a lifestyles section will feature presentations on health, wellness, gardening and home improvement.

Authors from all over the globe will be in attendance covering a wide range of topics and literary genres. 

Writers such as Bell Hooks, Maureen Dowd, Edwidge Danticat, Brian Weiss, Alexander McCall Smith and Florida International's own Dr. Carol Boyce-Davies will be present. Dr. Davies will also head the Africa Diaspora Panel. 

A Spanish language program with readings and panels with authors from Spain and Latin America is available. The annual Caribbean Authors Panel will discuss their craft and literary experiences.

All fair events will take place at the Wolfson Campus and the surrounding downtown area.
