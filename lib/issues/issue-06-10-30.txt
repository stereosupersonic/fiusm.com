Headline: Now is the time to panic, Dolphin fans
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Even as Halloween nears, nothing has been or will be scarier than the football the Miami Dolphins have been playing every week this season. 

Thankfully the bleeding (i.e. losing) stopped Oct. 29, in Week eight but only because the Dolphins did not play at all.

With a 1-6 record, it's about time the Dolphins' organization press that panic button. In fact, the button should have been pushed after the loss to the woeful Houston Texans.

At this point, missing the playoffs for a fourth-straight season is a foregone conclusion - unless the team runs off nine-straight wins, which we all know is too tall a task. The Dolphins have lost to a 2-4 team and three 1-5 teams. That should tell you just how terrible things are and how much worse things can get.

The remaining schedule includes games on the road against the Chicago Bears and the Indianapolis Colts and home games against the New England Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars. Hell, every single team the Dolphins play from here on out will be tough and they have now become one of the "easy teams" on a good team's schedule.

After repeatedly bashing my head against the keyboard, I've come to realize that this has been just another rebuilding year. Even though last year's team finished with six-straight victories, half of those wins came in meaningless games (for the opposing team) and, in essence, were sham victories.

That means all the preseason hype - including being picked as the Super Bowl winner by ESPN the Magazine - was a sham as well.

It's really gut wrenching for a fan to realize his team is highly flawed, even more so when others agreed with you and thought the team was supposed to be good. 

If one crazy guy starts running down the street yelling, "The world is going to end! The world is going to end!" you would be quick to brush him aside like the loon he is. 

Now if a group of 10,000 people were running down the street yelling the same thing, you'd be more likely to listen. You might even join in. After all majority rules, right?

Well, I listened to those 10,000 people, except these people were yelling, "Dolphins Super Bowl!" I had my doubts going into the season, even after the six-straight wins to finish off last season, but I fell for the hype. I was legitimately convinced this team was a contender, even though their only "upgrade" was at quarterback - and we've seen how successful that's turned out so far.

Now a guy who was almost literally pushed out of the Detroit Lions' organization is taking the snaps for us. What kind of a player are you if you're not good enough to play for the Lions?

Surprisingly enough, this "reject" is actually playing better than our supposed savior, Daunte Culpepper.

Joey Harrington is a better fit for the Dolphins's offense in its current state. Harrington has a quick release, which works better with Miami's mediocre offensive line. 

Harrington is on pace to be sacked almost half as much as Culpepper, but it could also be because Harrington doesn't hold the ball for eight seconds, scanning the field like Culpepper does. I know the o-line is not that good but how can you expect them to hold a defense for eight seconds? Ridiculous.

Quarterback and offensive line aren't the only positions the Dolphins have problems with. Except for "the little engine that could" Wes Welker, most of the Dolphins' receivers have been pretty inconsistent. In fact, two of Joey Harrington's three interceptions against the Green Bay Packers came as a result of easy catches that were tipped in the air. 

Let's face it; the entire offense is in shambles.

The defense, which was always a strong point for the Dolphins teams of the past decade, is still a strong point today considering it's in the top ten in almost every defensive category in the NFL. 

However, the defense is terrible in stopping third-down conversions and has allowed many game-changing big plays. It's really worthless to be in the top 10 in the league in total defense when it's only two or three big plays that are causing you to lose.

As much as it sucks to admit it, folks, the Dolphins will not be coming home for Super Bowl XLI.

Unless, of course, their offensive line improves dramatically, their receivers start making big plays, their quarterbacks start making better passes, the running game begins to pick things up, the defense starts stopping teams on third down and stops allowing big plays, the special teams puts the offense in better field position, Olindo Mare starts making some clutch field goals and, of course, win nine-straight games.

Yup. They're screwed.

Headline: Team chaplain not just a spiritual advisor
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
While the football team practices, shadowed by coaches' instructions and commands, a large man paces the sideline conversing with coaches and substitute players. He huddles up with the entire team at the end of practice and yells "FIU" with them

This man is Steve Lantz, football team chaplain.

Lantz's primary duty is to provide chapel service on game day, which is optional to players. He reads excerpts from the Bible, alluding to stories of strength and courage in order to instill confidence in the players. If there were a group of Jewish players or Muslim players on the team, then Lantz would provide the necessary personnel on game day, such as a rabbi or an imam. 

Providing game-day chapel is his expressed job, but implicit in his job, according to Lantz, is the duty "to be there everyday for practice because you never know what's going to happen."

According to Lantz, if a player is seriously injured, he's the guy who pats the player on the back and tells him everything's going to be okay. Lantz feels that if he is not visibly available to players, then he hasn't fulfilled his role as chaplain. Even though the chaplain position holds great responsibility, enjoyment can be extracted from it. 

"What I enjoy the most are the friendships," Lantz said. "Being able to be part of the players' and coaches' lives and the University."

Lantz was born in Lafayette, Indiana, but has resided in Miami since he was eight years old. He studied psychology and studio art at Rice University; however, he is currently completing his masters at American University of Biblical Studies.

Alexander Bostic III and Antwan Barnes have known Lantz since he was their chaplain at Norland High School. 

"He is the one piece of inspiration we need as a team," Barnes said.

Bostic recalled his first collegiate game against Indiana State, which Bostic did not start but did not prevent Lantz from attending.

"He was with us in high school; now he's with us on the big stage," Bostic said.

According to Lantz, he cares for the players whether they gain 400 yards or no yards - regardless of how they perform on the field 

The loss of any of the friendships Lantz established with the team is extremely painful. The death of former FIU football player Lance Preston hurt him deeply. 

Lantz's presence at Preston's memorial service fulfilled his expressed duty as chaplain and his inherent duty as Preston's friend.

"So many of his friends were in a despair almost without hope," Lantz said. "I tried to offer hope in that situation. I felt that, as chaplain, that's my job. I was thankful to be somewhat of a comfort to some people."

As a chaplain you wouldn't expect Lantz to wear an earring, but he does it to dispel the stereotype that people with piercings are degenerates. 

"Players would ask me, 'Steve, do you think people with earrings are bad?' I would always say no, so I got one to prove my point," Lantz said. 

Throughout his life, Lantz has had one governing philosophy that his mentor chaplain, who is a Colonel in the United States Army, taught him:

"You serve everybody."

Headline: A NEW OUTLOOK: Kremser's coaching style has changed after 27 years
Author: Sergio Carmona / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Men's soccer coach Karl Kremser looked a lot calmer than he did a few years ago.

As a former player looked on, he was surprised to see a peaceful coach standing on the sidelines instead of the fiery one who blasted players for mistakes.

Kremser now keenly observes the players' mistakes rather than show his once usual tirade. 

Baffled by the coach's tranquility, the alumnus asks him if there's anything wrong. This 62-year-old, ultra-competitive soccer coach has learned to alter his coaching style after over 30 years of coaching the game--27 of them with FIU. 

"If you let your emotions get in the way, you couldn't rationally look at the game the way it should be," Kremser said. "I've learned that you have to look at the game and see what you can get from your players rather than get upset at them and ask, 'Why is it going badly?' and 'What can I do?'"

Kremser's assistants have noticed the shift in his stern approach. 

"Karl has mellowed over the years," said assistant coach Joe Massi. "He has adjusted to the players because players are different and that's a good thing. Society changes and kids change."

Despite his unique approach to the game, former players respect Kremser's role as a mentor and friend.

"Every coach has his own style, but I can say that he's a very good friend of mine," said Munga Eketebi, a long-time assistant coach who played under Kremser from 1983-1986.

Kremser, a native from Salzwedel, West Germany, took over as FIU's men's soccer coach in 1980. The team was a promising Division II program that was just hitting its peak. Although Kremser's goal was to maintain the status of the program, he further progressed it as he took the team to four NCAA national title games in a six-year span and winning titles in 1982 and 1984. 

The program made the leap to Division I-A in 1987 and continued its success, posting winning seasons and national title appearances in 1996 and 2000. 

Kremser has won over 300 games for FIU, as well as numerous Coach of the Year awards. He's also coached 32 All-state selections and 38 of his players have moved on to the professional ranks.

However, Kremser's most proud moment in FIU has been the school's ability to compete with much bigger schools.

"I've enjoyed, more than anything else, playing with the big boys," Kremser said. "It's always a challenge because when playing better teams in the country, a lot of times we're in a disadvantage because of the budget they have. As a coach and athlete, I always want to compete against the best."

Kremser immigrated with his family to the United States when he was seven. He was a well-rounded athlete as a child, competing in basketball, track and soccer, which he fell in love with while in junior high school.

He was completely drawn to the game.

"I enjoy soccer because of [the] pure joy of it. It gives everybody the chance to do something with the ball," Kremser said. "Every single player on the field is almost the quarterback because they have to make decisions with the ball."

Kremser attended the United States Military Academy at West Point as a high jumper and soccer player. 

He transferred to the University of Tennessee to further pursue his opportunity as a high jumper. However, he couldn't continue his soccer career because Tennessee didn't field a soccer team, so he became the place kicker for its football team.

A mist of serendipity arose as he was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in 1969. This gave him the opportunity to come to Miami, where he quickly found himself out of a job and in need of an opportunity to coach.

"I had no ambition to actually coach," Kremser said. "I had a huge house payment and I [needed] to work, so I got a job at Palm Springs Junior High school in Hialeah, where I [had to decid] whether to teach or to coach. I decided to coach. They had tournaments each year and I enjoyed that."

Kremser got his coaching license and coached Palm Springs in the early '70s. 

He then made the leap to the high school level as he took over Killian Senior High School's soccer team in 1975. At Killian, he lead the team to its first ever state-championship in 1976. 

The following year, he made the transition to college as he took over Davidson College. He was selected Men's Coach of the Year in his third and final season there. 

It was after his stint at Davidson when Kremser began his legendary career at FIU.

Kremser is currently married to his wife Hill and has two sons, Jon and Kurt, who are both in their 30s. 

After retirement, Kremser would like to travel to places such as Asia, the South Seas, South America, Alaska and Russia.

Today, however, Kremser's extensive coaching resume is something that makes him proud and fortunate. 

"To me, coaching is a dream," Kremser said. "When my father came to this country, he broke his back. To me, I never felt like I worked a day in my life. This is something I really enjoy. It's a labor of love. People who do physical, manual labor, that's hard work. 

"This isn't hard work. You can't ask for more because I'm involved with young people."

Headline: FIU must reconsider dismissal of players
Author: Ty Wright / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
New athletic director Pete Garcia did not demonstrate any measure of reason or consideration when administering severe punishments to two Golden Panthers football team members, Marshall McDuffie and Chris Smith. McDuffie and Smith are the two players who have been dismissed from FIU's football team for their involvement in the now infamous "Orange Brawl."

Some players from FIU and the University of Miami have known each other since high school, and players from FIU state that those friendships remain today.

Contrary to what UM coach Larry Coker stated in a press conference following the scuffle, it was not FIU players' resentment over being Golden Panthers that caused the brawl. 

The real culprit was the exceedingly competitive mood in the atmosphere that day - between the rival coaches and players, as well as students, staff, alumni and fans. 

The game was marketed as a colossal extravaganza in the prominent ads featured online, in newspapers and on countless posters throughout the city. To make matters worse, it was sold as pay-per-view rumble for the locals who could not get tickets. All this inevitably created tension, and the volcano erupted.

The NCAA and Sunbelt conferences handed out penalties accordingly and swiftly - not because they were attempting to accommodate the schools, but because they were experienced and assessed the situation carefully. 

On Oct.16, Garcia exacerbated the situation by dismissing two FIU players, effectively holding McDuffie and Smith accountable for the actions of two entire university teams. 

In contrast, UM President Donna Shalala announced Oct. 17 that although the incident is still under examination, UM "will not throw any student under the bus for the public restoration of our image." Instead, UM's coaching staff and athletic director are being held accountable for the actions of the team they lead.

It is imperative that FIU students and faculty support the two players who got the rawest end of this deal and pressure the athletic department to overturn the players' dismissal. 

A group of students led by Carmen Vaz have taken the initiative to create a petition to do just that. With a twist of irony, most University cooperation has come from Pete Garcia's office. Garcia's secretary provided the students with the procedures and protocol to begin the petition. "The response has been very positive and students now look for us to inquire about the petition," said Dee Dee Fletcher, a member of the petition campaign.

You can find the petitioners in the Breezeway Cafe or crusading inside and around the Graham Center. Once the signatures have been collected, they will be forwarded to Garcia, to FIU President Modesto Maidique, to the FIU coaching staff and possibly to media outlets.

Perhaps we can still salvage what is left of FIU's image by giving McDuffie and Smith an appropriate shot at redemption. In time, this foul-up will seem distant when we look back through the rearview mirror at FIU's progress.

Headline: Votes: They only make a difference if they're cast
Subheadline: The ballots that students fill out today will decide the policy that affects their lives tomorrow
Author: Jose de Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
College students in the '60s missed the point: they set their expectations way too high for the political system. 

As idealists, they expected politics to make the world a better place. 

Politics is a dirty business; its purpose is not to make our ideals a reality, but rather to determine and manage the administrative details of our country. You don't need to care about world peace to vote Nov. 7. You just need to care about how public policy affects your private life. 

From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, university students churned out en masse to demand that the United States pull out of Vietnam. 

More than 100,000 students joined the Students for a Democratic Society and clashed with law enforcement in anti-war protests on hundreds of campuses around the country. In one such protest, at Kent State University in 1970, the National Guard gunned down four students. 

Their high-minded efforts didn't do much: a generation later, things are still the same.

Nonetheless, it's probably safe to assume that if these kids were willing to invest the time and effort to get beaten and shot, they probably went out of their way to vote, too. 

The ballots they cast did not give us world peace, but the candidates they chose determined the domestic policies that gave them the lifestyle they enjoy now.

Voter turnout among the 18-to-24-year-old age group has declined steadily since 1972, and now averages about 30 percentage points lower than the turnout for the rest of the population.

For the most part, students are unwilling to take a second from their classes and jobs - let alone their busy social lives - to think about politics.

It's not unheard of for civic-minded professors, in a last-ditch effort to coerce their students into behaving like members of a participatory democracy, to offer extra credit to students who can prove they cast their ballots on Nov. 7.

As students, we should not need such incentives to motivate us to get out and vote. The choices we make at the booth have direct effects on our lives as students, and that should be incentive enough for us. 

On Oct. 24, the Faculty Senate voted to extend the class schedule to include classes on Friday. This is something the University needs to do in order to secure state funding. 

The only reason the University needs to take such measures is that the funds the state gives to universities for construction and maintenance are expected to decrease after 2007. 

The amount of money the state can allocate for these funds each year depends directly on gross tax receipts - the amount of taxpayer money it collects that fiscal year. Thus, the amount of money available for universities is a function of the state's tax policies.

By that logic, when you're driving to school for your 9 a.m. Friday class next year, you can blame Jeb Bush and your friendly Florida legislature.

Forget the high-minded motives that drove students in the '60s to political involvement. If they felt the need to go out of their way and do something about the plight of Vietnamese peasants or the civil rights of minorities in other states, good for them. 

You don't have to want to make the world a better place to go out and vote.  Sheer selfishness is reason enough. 

Indulge yourself for an hour on Nov. 7 and vote for a candidate whose decisions will affect your daily life.

Headline: Lectures mix education, religion
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A feminist theologian, a Grammy award-winning singer and a yogi chef are just a few of the people that the Center for the Study of Spirituality has invited to FIU this year.

The center was inspired by the Dalai Lama's 1999 visit, when he addressed the role of spirituality in American education. 

"In the modern education system, you pay attention to the proper development of the brain, but you do not pay adequate attention to the development of the warm heart," he said in an address to an audience of over 5,000 people.

Nathan Katz, who was responsible for both of Dalai Lama's visits to FIU, took the words to heart and by 2004 had established an interfaith multi-disciplinary institute housed under the College of Arts and Sciences, stepping down as the founding chair of the Department of Religious Studies to become director of the center.

According to Katz, the center is primarily concerned with the study of secular spirituality, what he calls, "a contemporary phenomenon that connects spirituality to … everything." 

"Our role is to build bridges and connections where the academic and professional disciplines of the University are addressed by spirituality," Katz said.

The center's most successful tool in forming these bridges has been its popular lecture series, which has brought to FIU the Dalai Lama and other spiritual leaders, including rabbis, priests, imams, as well as professors from prestigious institutions such as the University of London and Yale University. Recently, the center invited the world-famous entertainer Gloria Estefan as this year's World Wisdom Scholar-in-Residence. 

"This program brings in a scholar [or] artist who is also a practitioner of spirituality. The scholar spends a week on campus, guest teaching in a variety of classes and meeting with student groups at both campuses and also gives one major public lecture," Katz said.

In past years, scholars have included a kabbalist, a contemplative monk and a Tibetan lama. Some students were surprised by the center's choice for this year.

"Gloria Estefan? That seems a little different, when you're coming from the Dalai Lama who's made spirituality his entire life," said freshman Jeffrey Nejad. 

However, the center's "big project" this semester, according to Katz, is a program on the Torah and Qu'ran that explores how Jews and Muslims perceive each other's presence in the Holy Land. In light of the long-running tensions between the two groups, Katz calls the event, "very important and timely."

Nejad agreed.

"What the center's doing is great because it keeps the lines of communication open between groups. When you don't have a free exchange of ideas, that's how conflict evolves," Nejad said. "I hope more people get involved in this."

Students are not the only ones who perceive the center's mission as significant to the general FIU community.

Instructor Russ Shulkes, who teaches a course in religious analysis and interpretation, encourages his students to attend events hosted by the center.

"I always offer five points of extra credit to students who go to the lectures and I've even been to a few myself ... They're interesting and highly relevant," Shulkes said.

University President Modesto. A. Maidique has also taken notice of the center's work and last year wrote a piece for El Nuevo Herald highlighting its role for the University as a whole.

"People are passionately interested in spirituality, both for personal reasons and because of its profound impact on society, so we attract a lot of attention," Katz said. 

The center relies heavily on this attraction, as it is fully funded by community donations and grants. It functions on fluctuating annual budgets of $50,000 to over $100,000.

The center also aims to infuse an educational curriculum with spirituality education and is set to propose to the University Curriculum Committee an undergraduate certificate program in the study of spirituality.

"What we're doing is unique in higher education … [People] may or may not be personally interested, but I think everyone has at least some curiosity - and that is a good thing," Katz said.

A calendar of the center's events can be found at http://cas.fiu.edu/SpiritualityCenter/lectureseries.htm.

Headline: Admissions test to be revamped
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Some major changes are in store for students taking the Medical College Admissions Test. 

In the past, the MCAT was only administered twice a year, once in April and again in August. 

According to Pre-Health Professions Advisor Dr. Barbara Roller, the dates in which the MCAT used to be held were very detrimental to students.

"Students tend to blow off classes or study time in order to study for the MCAT," Roller said, who added that the previous dates did not give students enough time to retake the exam if need be.

One major change is the exam's availability. Beginning January 2007, the test will be available 22 times out of the year. 

The real change, however, is that it will no longer be a paper based test. Instead, the MCAT will be completely computerized.

"There is no reason it should remain a paper test," Roller said.	

The MCAT will be conducted by Pro Metric, a company that administers various computer tests nationwide, according to Matt Fidler, MCAT program manager for Kaplan Test Prep and Admissions. 

As a result, Fidler warns students to be diligent about signing up for classes.

"Each Pro Metric testing location can usually accommodate about 20 people," Fidler said. "Many locations will fill up fast."

In the past, the MCAT took an entire day to complete. With the new computerized version, the testing time will be cut down to four and a half hours.

"Students need to understand what it's like to take the MCAT on the computer," Fidler said. "It's not going to be like any interface they have used before. That's why Kaplan has set up a free practice test for the MCAT at Kaptest.com/mcat. Students will be able to get a feel for the interface as well as some understanding as to the type of questions on the MCAT."

Despite the benefits of having the MCAT computerized, pre-med students still seem to prefer the paper-based test.

"I like the traditional way better," said pre-med student Salvador Cotes. "It gives you more opportunity to analyze the test."

Sophomore pre-med student Ana Lanza says that the new computerized version of the test will have its advantages and its disadvantages.

"It will be even harder because you will not be able to go back and forth between questions," Lanza said. "But it's an advantage that you will have so many opportunities to take it."

While students may not have the same amount of flexibility when it comes to how they look over their tests, they will be still provided scratch paper in order to take minor notes during the exam, according to the MCAT's website www.AAMC.org. 

The scratch paper will be collected after the exam to be discarded, and it will not be let out of the testing room. 

According to Fidler, students will be able to highlight various objects on the computer screen to organize possible answers. 

Students will be able to change answers in any given section. 

However, once the time for that section has run out, students will no longer be able to go back to edit their answers. 

Time seems to be the greatest improvement when it comes to the new computerized MCAT. 

In the past the MCAT took over eight weeks to be graded, according to Roller.

"Once the test is computerized it will only take about four weeks for the MCAT to be graded," Roller said. "Then when the computerized test reaches its second year, only about two weeks for it to be graded."	

Normally, registration for the MCAT starts about six months before the scheduled date, but for the January testing dates, registration at aamc.org/mcat is expected to begin sometime in November.

"Overall there are definite advantages to the computerized version of the test," Fidler said. "Students do need to know all of the same content as they would have for the original test. Even though there are going to be less questions, the same subject matter will still be covered on the MCAT."

Headline: Public Safety forum addresses student fears
Author:  Naihobe Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Students raised questions and shared opinions with University administrators at a safety forum held at Lakeview Hall Oct. 17.

The forum is part of the Department of Public Safety's attempt to keep up with the growing needs of the University.

The forum was coordinated and hosted by Christopher Agard and Robert Nguyen, president and vice president of Lakeview North.

"Things have happened to people that I'm close with; like one friend finding a man in her room that wasn't supposed to be there. Then it happened to another friend. I realized it could happen to anyone," Nguyen said.

Presenters asked students to practice safety measures like keeping room doors closed and not opening entry doors for strangers. They also offered other safety tips. 

According to Law Enforcement Captain Jesse Scott, Public Safety divides crimes into two categories - crimes against property and crimes against persons - to gauge how safe the campus is.

"Is the campus safe for students? That's the key question. Could you have your car stolen? Sure, maybe. We're not trying to undermine those kinds of incidents, but our ultimate priority is the personal safety of the students and faculty," said Scott.

He pointed to decreased numbers of crimes against persons: including rape, aggravated assault, and robbery. In 2004, there were 14 reported cases of aggravated assault. In 2005, there were only four cases. This year, there have been two cases. 

Stalking cases have seen a similar decline, from 18 reported incidents in 2005 to four to date this year. Figures for other crimes against persons have remained consistently low. 

Crimes against property are decreasing as well. In 2004, there were 86 burglaries. That number decreased to 58 in 2005. So far this year, there have been 42 reported burglaries. 

Vehicle theft in particular has seen the largest increase. In 2004, 14 vehicle thefts and attempts were reported. In 2005, however, the number increased to 17. This year, there have been 61 auto thefts and attempts so far.

Bill King, chief of Public Safety said the department was expecting to receive increased funding to match FIU's growing population. The number of active officers is also expected to increase in the near future.

"If you look at the size of the University, with 38,000 going on 40,000 students on campus at any time of the day and night, and close to 4,000 students who live on campus, we're talking about almost a small city," King said, assessing the campus' safety needs.

King asked students to guess the average number of officers on patrol at any one time. As most students called out numbers in the teens and twenties, one student guessed correctly.

"Who said 'three?' That's it, that's what we got," King said. "I'm not complaining about the number that we have, but we do need to have a few more officers."

According to King, Public Safety is evolving to meet the ever changing needs of the University, specifically addressing the rise in crimes involving vehicles.

"When we see patterns in any type of a crime, we adjust our patrols around that particular area. We may put some people in plain clothes to do a little more surveillance," said King. "We also try to put out information to students, faculty, and staff so they can use common sense to keep their personal property protected."

Sophomore Maday Hernandez, uses common sense but finds FIU to be a safe place.

 "When I'm here late I try to walk with my cell phone in hand, or with a friend, but I feel safe. I also worry a little about my stuff sometimes, but I don't feel like I should worry too much. I've never had any problems," Hernandez said.

Headline: IN HIS TWENTIES: President celebrates 20 years of service
Author: Reuben Pereira / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With an outdoor setting, food, confetti, party hats and salsa music, the surprise event to commemorate Modesto "Mitch" Maidique's 20 years of service at FIU as University president had more in common with a brunch party than a formal University gathering. 

The surprise event, held Oct. 26 at the Betty Chapman Plaza and hosted by the Division of Student Affairs and the University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Associations, was a light-hearted affair, attended by University delegates, administrative, staff and student body members.

"The first thing I'd like to tell you is thank you and, boy, am I surprised," Maidique said to the crowd of nearly 100 revelers. "I have now lost complete confidence in the people who schedule me. I want to know if I'm really going to San Diego today?" 

The event started at 12:40 p.m. at the north entrance of the Graham Center where the FIU Marching Band, former SGA Presidents and the FIU cheerleaders and Dazzlers awaited the arrival of  Maidique from the Faculty Club; Provost and Executive Vice President Ronald Berkman had previously escorted Maidique to the Faculty Club from his office.

After being led into GC by Berkman, Maidique was welcomed by SGA presidents Alfonso "Alfie" Leon and Camilo Silva as well as former SGA presidents and the FIU Marching Band that led the parade through GC playing "Hail to the Chief." 

After a brief introduction by Vice President of Student Affairs Rosa Jones, Leon and Silva led the proceedings by honoring Maidique on behalf of the student body.

"Through his years as president, Modesto "Mitch" Maidique has allowed for the development of programs that have enriched the education of students at FIU," Silva said. "SGA would like to show its appreciation to President Maidique for his contribution to students by honoring him as a student."

Leon added that Maidique had always wanted to be a graduate of the University and joked that the president even married an FIU graduate to fulfill his wish.

To honor the president's wishes, Leon and Silva named Maidique as an honorary member of the 2006 graduating class and light-heartedly presented him with five items a student would need: a book bag, a 2006 Graduation Class T-shirt, an iPod Nano, a world atlas and a jar of M&Ms.

As a final gift, Silva and Leon gave Maidique a "Student Government Key of Success" and a "Crystal Ball" for his 20 years of service to the University.

Following this presentation, Silva and Leon read a new resolution that established the Modesto A. Maidique Leadership Award which, starting in 2007, will  award students who demonstrate vision and creativity on campus as part of the Student Life Awards.

 Following a banner presentation by the children of the Children's Learning Center, Jones took the podium once again by presenting a "very special award" to the president - a scaled version of the mural that decorates the Atrium and the North entrance of GC.

"It is a graphic artistic replication of your many accomplishments here at FIU," Jones said, before unveiling the mural. "There's a place at GC that you very much admire: the actual graphic that demonstrates the many accomplishments of FIU. We think that it represents everything positive about you, in terms of your accomplishments, and we hope you will admire it for many years." 

"I don't know how many of you have lived in other countries but I'd like to say 'What a country,'" Maidique said. "To allow me to have the opportunity to come to this country, to go to one of the foremost academic institutions and to be the president of this great University for 20 years. I think it says more about the United States than about me. I think with hard work, integrity and tenacity, anything is possible."

"The one thing you need at this University is student support, and, boy, do I have the support of students today," Maidique said. 

He concluded his speech by thanking his wife Nancy and led the crowd in a salsa dance. 

"And now I came to do what all of you came here to see and that is to see Nancy and I dance," Maidique said.

Headline: Review: The Big Squeeze Juice Bar (Food)
Author: Lalinda De La Fuente / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Among the hustle and bustle of Miami's metropolitan atmosphere, we sometimes forget that we're in a tropical haven, complete with swaying palm trees, relaxing beaches and warm weather. The Big Squeeze Juice Bar (18315 West Dixie Highway) brings you back to just that.  

Inconspicuously situated on West Dixie Highway in North Miami, The Big Squeeze offers patrons a respite from the heat with fresh fruit juices and smoothies as well as healthful affordable fare.

At The Big Squeeze, customers can choose to either sit outside under the Miami sunshine or take a break inside - the atmosphere is relaxed so you better not be in a rush.

However, it is an understaffed restaurant, with servers doing everything from waiting to making the juices, thus making the service slow, albeit conductive to the relaxing environment.

Laid back is the mantra here with cool water mists sprayed from above and Bob Marley playing in the background (which later transitions into James Taylor and Sublime).  

If you couldn't see Dixie Highway, you'd feel like you were on the beach.

The Big Squeeze is the perfect place to stop in and have a fresh fruit juice or smoothie. 

All its fruity concoctions are made completely from scratch with natural ingredients - I watched as they filled a blender with lemons, pineapple and mint to create my refreshing and delicious mint lemonade.

Although their drinks are pricey (about $5), their food is affordable. 

The menu offers a variety of sandwiches and salads that are around the same price as drinks.   

The Big Squeeze's sandwiches and wraps can be topped with a variety of sauces that are brought to your table. Watch out for the green sauce made with cilantro if spicy isn't your thing. For everyone else, it serves as the perfect kick for the sandwich.

The grilled snapper sandwich is also a healthful choice.  Fish can be expensive but at around $5, this sandwich is both easy on your wallet and satisfying to the palette.  

Finish any meal with a smoothie to go as a refreshing, healthful and fruity dessert.  

Their smoothies pack so much fruity punch that the traditional ice cream or cake will be forgotten.

Headline: Review: Running with Scissors (Movie)
Author: Shawn Sprockett / Asst. Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
If you're getting ready to go see Running with Scissors this week, you'd better read carefully: this film may not be what you expect.

Running with Scissors is the film adaptation of the popular book by the same name. The story follows writer Augusten Burroughs (Joseph Cross) through his adolescence as he copes with an alcoholic father, Norman Burroughs (Alec Baldwin), and a manic-depressive mother, Deidre Burroughs (Annette Bening). 

At age 13, the young boy is given up for adoption to his mother's psychiatrist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox), and his highly dysfunctional family. Here,  he experiences his homosexuality and feelings of abandonment amidst the insanity of his caretakers and their children.

Gwyneth Paltrow takes a minor role in this film as Hope, the cat-torturing daughter of Dr. Finch. Other roles worth noting are that of Agnes Finch, played by Jill Clayburgh, and Diedre Burroughs, played by Annette Bening. Both Clayburgh and Bening have been nominated for an Academy Award twice before. Their stellar performances in Running with Scissors are sure to land them on the Academy's ballot once again.

There are two kinds of people who will go see this movie: those who read the book and those who didn't even know there was one.

The first group is rarely ever pleased by cinematic adaptations because movies seldom meet the level of depth possible by literature. Running with Scissors is no exception to the rule. Despite the reputation of Nip/Tuck's creator, Ryan Murphy, the acclaimed director's movie version of the popular memoir draws overly simplistic characters and significantly less humor. Readers will be disappointed to find that the comical stylings of Augusten Burroughs are practically lost amongst the dried-out dialogue and lack of character development.

To the second group who've never read the book: don't be fooled by witty trailers. Running with Scissors is far from your typical dark comedy. Emphasizing the story's drama, the film is more depressing than amusing. Rather than playing on the humorous dysfunctions of Augusten Burrough's nightmarish family, the film delves into deep themes of drug abuse, the dangerous flaws of psychoanalysis, and the oppression of homosexuals. These themes deserve attention, but don't buy tickets for this film expecting laughs of Little Miss Sunshine proportions.

The film suffers from a problem that all true-to-life stories deal with: they're less entertaining than invented plots. While a screenwriter with a fresh start might have developed more closure and humor to carry the often-dragging plot, the story was bound to real life and all its inconsistencies.

While the movie has sat uncomfortably with readers and critics, it still delivers an inspiring message of determination in the midst of a devastated familial background. Despite criticism, Running with Scissors has plenty to offer to those with an interest in dark humor, abnormal psychology and unbelievable stories that challenge you to follow your dreams.

Headline: Review: Rotary Downs - Chained to the Chariot (Music)
Author: Jose de Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
For a band impudent enough to release an album almost entirely dedicated to ripping off Pavement, Rotary Downs could have done much worse. 

Under any other circumstances, trying to replicate the legendary Stockton, California indie band--indeed, for many, the most important indie band of the '90s--would be a capital offense. 

Pavement died in '99, though, and none of its former members have released any material that comes close to what they recorded as a band. 

The only post-Pavement solo effort worth mentioning is Stephen Malkmus's material, which is half-decent at best.

After nearly seven years, what's a die-hard Pavement fan dying for new material to do but settle for a bunch of snot-nosed, college-aged copycats? Besides, on their new album, Chained to the Chariot, Rotary Downs do the job so, so well.

The album comes off to a shaky start with a mediocre first four tracks, all of them sounding like any other 'fun' indie song out there. 

Each would be just as much at home on a Cake album, a Beck album or a Weezer ablum.

Suddenly, on the fifth track, "Holiday Home," the album takes a steep hike from slightly annoying to electrifying. 

From that track onward, Chained to the Chariot is all sharp turns and unexpected corners, complex melodies and playful, catchy hooks. 

Some of the best tracks on the album pop up when Rotary Downs drops all pretenses and lifts from Pavement unabashedly. 

On "A Feast in Squalor" and "Pedigree," vocalist James Marler pulls off Malkmus's free-association rambling and smooth, sudden pitch changes perfectly, while "Me Lion Races Ruin" resembles Scott Kannberg's off-key guitar rambles to the T. Meanwhile, "Black Town" could well be an outtake from Terror Twilight.

Where Chained to the Chariot truly shines, however, is when Rotary Downs sets its Pavement-pilfering aside and dares to go further and beyond their idols' bounds. 

Take the aptly-titled "Djinni Stomp," for example: a frantic, claustrophobic frenzy that inevitably makes you dance all funky in the shower. It's delicious.

 Also "Old Museum," possibly the most memorable track on the album, builds on a classic Malkmus song structure and then adds the sinister, zonked-out guitar effects from the Ventures' "Walk, Don't Run."

For a bunch of snot-nosed, college-aged copycats, Rotary Downs gets the job done.

Headline: Review: Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 (Game)
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The rivalry between Donkey Kong and Mario has been going on for generations. With the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis for the Nintendo DS, the rivalry has stepped up a notch.

Unlike the first Mario vs. Donkey Kong, players do not control Mario in an attempt to save Mario's mechanical toy versions of himself. Rather the game mixes in an element from the original Donkey Kong: you have to save the damsel in distress with the use of your Mini Marios.

The object of the game is to get as many Mini Marios as you can through doors to reach a battle with Donkey Kong. Rather than simply control the Mini Marios, a player uses the stylus to point them in the right direction and watch them walk to their destination or off a cliff. You can't take your eyes off the screen lest one of your Minis bites the dust. But on the bright side, you can replay a level as many times as you want until you get the results you want. Players can receive four rankings after each level: none, bronze, silver, and gold.

If you have played the game Lemmings, it will all seem very familiar.

March of the Minis really makes use of the DS's dual screens. For the most part, players only have to focus on the bottom screen as most of the game levels are played entirely on the bottom screen. However when it comes to battles with Donkey Kong, players must pay attention to both screens simultaneously.

For boss battles, Donkey Kong will appear on the top screen and proceed to throw various objects at your Minis. The number of times you can be hit by these objects before the "game over" depends on how many Minis you were able to get through the doors in each level; this is why it's so important to save as many Minis as possible--they determine your strength in these "Kong Battles."

 Boss battles are also where players get the most action in the game. The way you defeat Donkey Kong is by shooting your Minis at him like missiles using a variety of contraptions ranging from sling shots to cannons. The use of both screens really makes this task challenging as players progress through the game.

Game play aside, the graphics in the game are flawless. The movie scenes are wonderfully rendered on the DS's dual screens, and each game level is vibrant and full of detail.

Another bonus to the game is being able to design your own levels. After you complete stages in the story mode, new building pieces will become available for you to use in constructing your own game level, though the design process can take a while if you're planning on a well designed stage.  

Overall, the game has hours of replay value attached to it, so it's worth the roughly $30 for it. Just try and remember to take a break every now and then unless you want a sore neck (ouch).

Headline: Visitors watch their step at local feces exhibit
Author: Jessica Gresko / AP Wire
&nbsp;
Meadow muffins. Guano. Feces. Solid waste. Kaka.

The words for poop are endless, but the Miami Metrozoo has another term to add to the list: educational.

Now on display is a 5,000 square foot exhibit on excrement titled "The Scoop on Poop," which invites visitors to explore the science of scat. 

The exhibit is filled with photos of animals in some of their most indelicate moments. Stool sample models abound: hay-like football-sized balls (elephant), kidney-bean-looking pellets (porcupine) and coal-like lumps coated with fur (black bear).

Beyond the "ick" factor, however, zoo officials and the exhibit's creators say there is a lot of information being imparted. Visitors can smell the stench of flowers that mimic dung to attract flies for pollination. Videos include one of a hippo spreading its droppings around to mark its territory. Simple games include "Who Dung It?" and "Test Your .2 I.Q."

"We didn't want this to be a gross exhibit for shock value," said Chad Peeling, who helped create the display. "Our goal with the exhibit was to make people think, kids especially, about the science in all aspects in life and this thing that adults don't like to talk about."

Miami is the exhibit's second stop after opening at a Virginia museum in May. Created by Clyde Peeling's Reptiland in Allenwood, Pa., it is based on a 2001 book of the same name. After the exhibit closes at the Metrozoo in January it will make stops in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Chad Peeling said.

The exhibit is not the first to feature feces, however. An exhibit called "All the Poop" toured Japan in 2001 and another in England showcased scat samples.

On a recent afternoon one woman cheered "go, go, go" as two children raced model dung beetles at a station in the Miami exhibit. Students on a class trip posed in a cutout of a person sitting in an outhouse. 

Others examined slides of parasites found in dung using a microscope, while classmates weighed themselves on a scale designed to tell them how long it takes an elephant to poop their weight.

"I don't think it's that disgusting," said Bruno Cazarini, 13, of the exhibit's topic. "I think plenty of people get the wrong impression."

Cazarini, who was visiting the zoo with a school group, said he knew about dung beetles, some of which burrow inside dung to eat and rest. But he did not know about its uses as a type of waterproof plaster for the homes of Masai people in East Africa, which he learned from information at the exhibit.

Adults have had fun with material, too. Some volunteers and zoo employees have started wearing plastic poop pins that look like the real thing. Zoo personnel have also brought out a bowl of chocolate-covered candy, inviting visitors to take one if they dare.

Elephant keepers, meanwhile, were charged with weighing the amount of elephant poop one of the zoo's Asian male elephants, Dahlip, produces in a 24-hour period. The turd total: 540 pounds. Meanwhile, a commercial for the exhibit, which will begin running shortly, has already shown up on YouTube and features a variety of grunting noises.

One couple, who are zoo donors, even called to offer to loan the zoo a scat sample of their own. The pair has a lump of excrement from 1973 Triple Crown winner Secretariat enclosed in a glass globe, which the zoo plans to put on exhibit within a few weeks.

For Gamma Epsilon Phi President Adriana Hernandez, her organization's visit to a local elementary school for a new reading program was a rewarding experience. 

"My best memory with Gamma Epsilon Phi was going to F.C. Martin Elementary School for our newly established reading program and seeing the looks on the faces of the children when the team walked into the classroom," said Hernandez. "They were so happy to see us and could not wait for our return."

GEP, the Honors College honors society, upholds philanthropy as one of its four core values, and membership into the organization is exclusive to Honors College students. However, it is up to the individual students to determine what role they will play, if any, within the organization. 

To sophomore Kristen Larson, enrollment into the society allows her to become more involved with the community and form bonds with other students. 

"What I like about GEP is that it is not only a group which allows you to socialize with other Honors College students outside of your Honors class, but it also gives you a chance to get involved in, and contribute, to the community," Larson said. 

Members are given the chance to participate in community service projects such as the Oct. 21 Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure, a marathon held in order to help raise funds for breast cancer research and outreach programs. The group also recently completed their Miami Children's Toy Drive, a service project dedicated to gathering toys for patients of Miami Children's Hospital.

Although community service plays an important part within GEP, another integral part is the education of its members.  

"We try to make our members grow socially and culturally throughout the year," said Alejandra Maruri, a member of the GEP Board of Directors.

GEP and the Honors College set up lectures, known as "Honors Hour Lectures," in order to do just that. A wide range of topics are covered in various fields of study in order to break the ties of ethnocentrism and to expand knowledge of certain issues.  

Both the Honors College and GEP recently presented an edition of the "Honors Hour Lectures" that featured Dr. Akin Ogundiran, director of African new-world studies for Biscayne Bay Campus and associate professor of History; he  educated more than 100 students on African new-world studies.  Other lectures are held throughout the year so that Honors College students and members of GEP are able to expand their cultural knowledge and their common perceptions.

Any students interested in GEP can find more information on the society's website at www.fiu.edu/~hcs.

Headline: Service with a smile: Organization seeks to educate students through social work
Author: Michelle Vega / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Last summer, 300 South Florida students, including several from FIU, joined together with native university students in the Dominican Republic and refurbished their local schools. This coming Spring, FIU students will help with an international volunteer project in Managua, Nicaragua, where an elementary school will be adopted and remodeled ­­- two new classrooms, a library, a computer lab and more facilities are set to be built. 

The FIU students involved in the two service projects are members of Service For Peace, an international non-profit organization that has a chapter at FIU and lets students engage in direct service within local and international communities.

The idea for an organization dedicated to bettering communities started with Harold Silva, former FIU student and founder of the FIU Service For Peace Chapter. Actively involved in the Center for Leadership and Service, Silva decided that he wanted to establish his own chapter so he gathered a group of FIU friends and colleagues and started one. 

"When Harold approached me and told me he wanted to expand Service for Peace into a university club, I was more than eager to help him and share with FIU an organization that has truly changed my life," said Sabrina Mendez, member and former president of SFP. 

Within SFP at FIU, students network with students from other institutions, residents, faculty and community leaders focusing on transforming communities through the active civic engagement of volunteers. SFP has become one of the most active student organizations on campus: In 2005, SFP was awarded the Outstanding Service Award from the Student Organizations Council, and in 2006 it was recognized as the feature student club on the Student Organizations Council semester newsletter. 

Supported by the Center for Leadership and Service, SFP has worked with the Alternative Spring Break program ­­and traveled to the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua to work with local schools. 

"We enhance education in these countries," said Silva. "We adopt an elementary school and paint new schools. We work with their native university students on the projects."	

Aside from hosting international projects, the organization deals with local communities. Local projects supported by SPF include neighborhood clean-ups, door-to-door informative campaigns, Adopt a Yard and the City of Miami Gardens, a city where members have adopted a road and built a community playground.

Mendez recalled a service event that the group aided at the Hope Center that was sponsored by a non-profit organization providing assisted-living and day-training programs for the disabled. 

"The beauty about this event … was that we got to work directly with the residents that we helped. As we did gardening, many of the residents joined us and gardened or made every attempt to do so," Mendez said.

By getting students involved in volunteer work, Silva hopes that "their experience fosters the students' academia by applying what they know and learning new things."

Aylin Ruiz, current President of SFP, believes that groups of dedicated individuals, such as SFP and other service organizations, can have a profound impact on communities.

"There is strength in knowing one single person can make a difference, but it is even better when a group of people can come together and make a greater change."

Headline: Inactive honor society revived
Author: Samuel Hyppolite / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Omicron Delta Kappa is a national leadership honor society that has over 285 active circles on college and university campuses throughout the United States.

About a year ago, FIU had an active ODK Circle, but after suddenly ceasing in 2005, it is being revived this year at Biscayne Bay Campus. 

The circle is under the University Park Honor's Council, an organization which handles all honors' societies that represent most  majors as well as various departments and leadership organizations. 

Edgard Izaguirre, elections commissioner for the Student Government Council at BBC hopes to eventually allow BBC to have its own Honor's Council and represent the various major's there.

"It's a great asset to the campus and promotes more involvement. Having our own Honor's Council would distinguish us. We do have great students at our campus, but they never get the chance to get fully recognized. I think this is a good chance to show our distinguished students," said Izaguirre.

The Honor's Council's purpose is to recognize students for "academic excellence and promote scholarship and community involvement," according to their website.

According to Bronwen Bares, ODK advisor at BBC, the ODK was disabled because there were no more active members to help it continue.

"Because a lot of our members graduated or moved to other universities in 2005, the Circle of ODK was obligated to cease at FIU," she said. 

"But this semester, we want to revitalize it with upper division or graduate students and faculty members who volunteer to cooperate with ODK and other leadership organization at FIU."

Unlike many other honor societies that focus mostly on students' class rank, the ODK requires more than that. 

The seven members of the ODK commitee evaluate students qualification based on their GPA and their leadership involvement. 

A 3.0 GPA for undergraduate and 3.3 for graduate students is required and at least one of the following experiences is required: scholarship, athletics, and campus or community service such as social and campus government, Journalism: speech and mass media, and creative and performing arts.

Fifty-three applications have been received in both BBC and UP; 27 applicants were accepted.

Former members are also eager for the societies comback to BBC.  

"I graduated right after my induction into ODK, as did most of my fellow inductees. Thus, it was mostly inactive during the 2005-2006 school year," said graduate student Micah Mintz.

"But I hope that the incoming class of inductees will revitalize the organization, and I look forward to participating with them,"  Mintz said.

"We know that many students have good grades, but we are trying to find student who are exceptional," Bares said.

Headline: Faculty Spotlight: Frederick R. Blevens Associate Sean of the SMC
Author: H. Dwight Holmes / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Frederick R. Blevens was named one of the nation's best journalism educators in 2001, but that news came as a shock because he had only been teaching full time for about six years. 

"I was floored. This is an award that usually goes to people with a lot more teaching experience. That made it even more rewarding," said Blevens.

Today, Blevens is the new associate dean of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication. He holds a bachelor's and master's degree in journalism from Ball State University and a doctorate degree from the University of Missouri School of Journalism. 

Blevens was one of only three college professors to receive the Journalism Teacher of the Year Award given by The Freedom Forum, a nonpartisan, international foundation dedicated to free press, free speech and free spirit. 

"The award has made me think deeply about why I left the newsroom for teaching. It also has increased my determination to move from being a good teacher to a great teacher," Blevens said.

He was a reporter, copy editor, and senior editor at several metropolitan newspapers and has taught at Ball State, Texas A&M and Southwestern.

Blevens founded the Oklahoma Institute for Diversity in Journalism and served as professor and associate dean at the University of Oklahoma from 2002-2006. 

He's has been involved with diversity programs since the mid 80s solving recruitment measures. He has also received many honors and is co-author Twilight of Press Freedom, a book that focuses on how world journalism is veering away from the traditional idea of the great value of press freedom.

Q: What is your first order of business here at the School of Journalism and Mass Communication?

I'm still trying to get oriented. I am trying to figure things out to the point where I can contribute to the program. I am not here to make radical changes.

Q: What's the most unique thing about SJMC's diverse population, and what challenges does it pose for you, as the new associate dean?  

Well, the thing that is the most unique about the school and the University is the diverse student, staff and faculty population. The challenges are meeting needs of the very, very diverse population.

Q: You started a diversity program at one of your previous schools. Are you concerned that the faculty here at the SJMC  is not very diverse? 

I think that's true, and am I concerned about that… oh, absolutely.

Q: Have you thought about addressing that disparity, like doing something about it?

Faculty representation is important for students, especially in an area where one has a diverse student population. Faculty diversification is probably the hardest thing too because there are so many things working against you like, one is pay, and the other one is how many of them are there to recruit from.  

Q: Why did you leave newspapers for academia? 

Well I always wanted to be a teacher; I studied to be a teacher when I was an undergraduate.

Q: What's the most important thing for FIU J-school students to learn here before they graduate? 

They have to learn how to gather information properly, and also analyze the information.
