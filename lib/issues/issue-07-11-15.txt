Headline: Finding passion in writing: Writer transitions from student to staff
Author: Eddith Sevilla / BBC Managing Editor
&nbsp;
He may not be a Miami Herald columnist, but David Berry, the School of Journalism and Mass Communication's marketing coordinator, has a flair for writing.

"The time that I started to feel that writing had power was at a turning point in my life," said Berry, who graduated in the Fall of 2006. "[When I was in a car accident], I wrote about it and then I shared that story. People were moved by it. To have the capability of drawing an emotion from someone is a powerful thing."

Berry, who has been working for SJMC since March, said he's still transitioning from being a student to being staff.

"Professors expect a lot from you as a student, but that's also at a time when it's okay for you to mess up; you're expected to," Berry said. "Now have a much smaller margin for error. I feel like I'm still a student because I'm learning so much everyday."

Catherine Ahles, chairperson for the advertising and public relations department and responsible for hiring Berry, said his skills appealed to SJMC staff.  

"He's one of the brightest, most talented grads of our [public relations] program," Ahles said.  

Berry oversees SJMC's alumni publication, The Communicator, and copy writing of SJMC's brochures, images, graphics and distribution.

 He describes his event planning demanding, yet rewarding.

"It's not one of the easiest parts of the job, but I can say my greatest reward for promotion had to be the turnout we had for our biggest event of the year, the Scripps Day Lectures," Berry said.

Before becoming staff, Berry's talents were already noticed by some professors.

"David was a student in one of my classes a few years ago," said Lynne Farber, an assistant advertising and public relations professor. "His work was so good that I asked him if he was already in the profession." 

After her graduate level students were unable to write a bone marrow drive press release, Farber asked Berry, then an undergraduate, to try. It was featured on FIU's Web site, the Spanish news network Univision and NBC6.

Berry said his employment experience has been invaluable.

"Not only is tuition reimbursement one heck of a benefit, but the ongoing education you'll get by working along side college professors is priceless," Berry said.

Headline: Searching for Silence: Students look for quiet places to nap
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Going home for a short nap in between classes may not always be an option for commuter students when on campus, so some students have sought out places in the University Park campus to go and take naps throughout the day. 

Linda De La Paz, chemistry major and commuter student, has been napping in between her classes this semester in order to help her function better and be able to catch up on her sleep during the day. 

"I started napping in school when [i realized] there weren't enough hours in the day," she said. "Classes started to get stressful and staying up until 2 a.m. becomes a regular, so to catch up on sleep I gotta nap."

Some of the most common places for students to catch up on their sleep are:



Their car



Some students don't like to be seen or have people walk around them while they sleep. Instead of taking a nap in one of the buildings, they prefer to use their cars where they can have some privacy.

Paz recalls an afternoon where she was seen by a public safety employee. He told her to roll down her windows while she napped so she wouldn't suffocate in the car. 

"Even though it was an awkward moment we chatted for one minute [about] the fact that so many FIU students sleep in their cars between classes," she said.



Green Library



Various floors of the library are used by students to take naps.The back of the first floor of the library has seats that have been pushed together where students can take advantage of the space and lie down, using their sweater as a pillow. 

The second floor is equipped with cubicles that can provide people with a quick nap, and the fifth and seventh floors entice students with "Quiet Zones" and a view of the city. 

Students such as Jephren Perez enjoy sleeping in the seventh floor where it's quiet and where the windows allow for sunlight.

"Most of the buildings on campus are usually just too cold to sleep comfortably," he commented, thereby making the seventh floor a perfect spot for him to go and take a nap whenever he has a gap between work and class.



Outside Deuxieme Maison



The bench located outside DM near the cube is also a spot where some students take naps. 

At one point, Angelica Gacayan, a sophomore in pre-nursing would sleep on the bench where she enjoyed the serene atmosphere around her because it helped her forget about the stress from her school work.

Gacayan feels that taking a nap is important, especially for college students, because most of the students on campus are sleep deprived. 

"I have a friend who suggested that we should have nap stations here on campus for people who want to take naps, especially commuter students," she said. "It sounds funny but this idea made sense to me because FIU is full of sleep-deprived people."







	Piano Room 



The piano room in the Graham Center houses a series of couches where some students can lie down and sleep while hearing others play the piano. Usually the room is quiet and crowded with students who are either sleeping or studying for exams. 

Perez enjoys napping inside the piano room because a variety of different students are always there, relaxing from stressful days.

"At any given time, there are different kinds of people playing anything from classical to modern music. It is soothing and puts me to sleep," he said.  



The Swinging Benches



With the recent weather change, students can enjoy sleeping in the green swinging benches located outside GC near the water fountain. 

Students such as freshman Ferran Coleman find the rocking motion pleasant and the sound of the fountain a good way to relax and feel peaceful. 

"Now that it is chilly outside, the green swings top all the napping places on campus: even my dorm sometimes," she said. 

Although many students nap on campus, some have stopped because they prefer not to be seen by others. 

Junior Rosalyn Delgado, finds that the downside about napping in public is that "people watch you sleep and you never know if you are going to snore too loudly, drool, or even if a friend is going to wake you up by throwing themselves on you like someone once did to me."

Headline: Club helps disadvantaged people in foreign countries
Author: Elsa Reinoso / Staff writer
&nbsp;
" Flags" is a student organization at FIU that provides aid relief to communities at risk around the world by making presentations in class rooms around campus and asking for donations. Established in the Fall of 2006, the club has 13 active members.

Yet due to the structure of the club,Flags could easily expand."Flags is designed so that any student could make a big difference by investing only a little of their time and effort," said Maria Alejandra Luque, the president and founder of this organization. 

Even though the club demands little of its members, the groups President feels that those who join the group can make the world a better place.

"It is extremely important to remind our fellow students and citizens that the state of the world is not a lost case like the media is constantly telling us," Luque said. "Our hands are not tied in the face of the multiple global crises that we witness."

The idea of Flags originated when the club's future founder left her home country to start a new life in a new land.

"The idea of creating this organization had been in my mind since I moved to the United States," Luque said. "At that point I realized that just as I brought with me big dreams of helping out my country (Colombia) and the determination not to leave my people behind, so did the millions of immigrants who come from many different nations to the United States following the same dream," she said.

Flags provides its members with a way to fufill their dreams of becoming part of something greater than themselves."I always wanted to do something like this, and I thought it would be a great way to start something that could become something really big in the future; I felt like I had to be part of it," said Alessandra Chiozza, secretary of Flags. "Flags is a great way to become involved in campus life since it doesn't take much time to do it and you are doing a good cause at the same time," Chiozza said. "Students will need just a few minutes a month to make theâ€¦ presentations."

Maria Jose Rendon, a junior in International Relations and Vice President  of Flags has been a member since the club's inception. "I believe that Flags is not only a great way for students to become aware of what is going on around them, but to actually do something about it," Rendon said.

This month Flags is raising funds for the victims of hurricane Felix in Nicaragua by sharing our message in FIU classrooms and receiving their contributions.

From Nov. 7 through Nov. 28, Flags will collect money for peasants of an African country that are trying to start a small business, underprivileged children of a South American country, and neglected communities of a Central American country.

Although the clubs members feel that it requires little effort to raise money for Flags, they still find the work they do very rewarding."What I like most about Flags would have to be the fact that I feel like I am actually doing something for someone that really needs it," Chiozza said. "I feel very passionate about this organization, just for the fact that we are helping people in many countries so far away from here and we are doing it by just the small effort of collecting money," she said.

Chiozza also said that it is incredible how every quarter, or every penny given, could help so much in countries like Peru, Colombia or Nicaragua.

At the end of every month, the members count the money they have raised. Even this aspect of the fund raising process can be fufilling to some.

"To me the most rewarding event is when we count the money that we have raised for that specific month," Rendon said. "Every time we do it we are reminded that our effort, in the end, does count."

In the end, though the club's members may not recieve any money for their labor, they are adequately compensated nonetheless.

"The communities that we assist do not count on any material goods to give us back in exchange of our help," Luque said. "The only reward for our work, which is also the most precious one, is the personal satisfaction of making a difference." 

Flags' final meeting of the semester will be in GC 1223 Nov. 28 at 7 p.m.

Headline: Degree Decisions...a career column: History majors can be more than historians
Author: Rocio Blanco / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU students have the chance to make history. With a history degree, there is no limit to what they can accomplish. 

"Our students do not only learn about past civilizations, they also acquire important analytical skills that can be helpful in many other professions," said Dr. Jeremy Rowan, associate chair of the history department.  

FIU currently has 220 history undergraduate students and about 110 graduate students who are taught more than just history. 

History students are trained to be critical readers, good writers, and astute analysts. They are taught how to see things in a broader context. 

 Those who study history analyze the past and learn how to put past situations into a present environment in order to gain a deeper understanding of the modern world. 

According to FIU's department of history website, these qualities and skills are fundamental for success in business activities, public and professional careers, teaching, and advanced studies.

History is a competitive discipline, but those who study history have many options. 

For those who decide to continue their education as graduate students, FIU has a masters program in history as well as doctoral program in Atlantic History. 

Both the masters and the doctoral programs require concentration in African, European, Latin American and U.S. history. 

"Those who want to be pure historians need a lot of experience. This can be earned teaching in both high-schools and colleges," Rowan said. "Many undergraduates gain experience while working in museums." 

He further explained how most historians become teachers, sometimes acquiring high positions in the administration of prestigious universities, but those who have a bachelor's degree in history also have the option of applying to law school. 

According to Rowan, most history majors become instructors however, there are many professions both in the private and public sectors that use the skills a historian acquires as an undergraduate. Many history majors are able to succeed in the field of law and the insurance industry.  

  As a lawyer, a historian researches public and private archives and record sources, they develop support material from historical evidence and apply oral history techniques for depositions. 

In the public sector, those with a history degree can work in archives, national park services and the intelligence services.  

Working as an intelligence service professional, a historian can use his or her skills to gather and analyze economic, political and social data and relate trends and precedents from the past to present and future events.  

When working at a national park, a historian offers tours around the park while giving classes and information about the history of the park.

FIU's Career Services Website has a job listing with many professions related to the field of history. 

One of the positions available at the moment is Database Clerk. This particular clerical job focuses on the use of primary sources to create a database of important people, places, and events in Miami history.

The American Historical Association website also lists many other careers a historian may want to pursue. These include FBI agent, legislator, and United Nations employee.  

"Those who want to pursue a career working for the UN or the peace corps can get experience working voluntarily for NGO's [Non-Governmental Organizations]." Rowan said.   

The salary of a historian varies depending on their area of concentration, their experience, and the field in which they choose to work.  

According to the Web site www.salary.com, a history professor in the Miami area starts at over $40,000 a year, but those who choose to go to law school can start working for as much as $75,000 a year. 

"We don't study history thinking about the money, we do it because we have a passion," Rowan said. "Since the first time I took a history course I knew I wanted to become a historian, now I teach history."



Degree decision is column that explores career options that various degrees offer. This will run every other week.

Headline: Lights of India: Students celebrate festival of light
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
The Indian festival of lights has returned with Diwali 2007, hosted by FIU's Indian Students Association. 

"[Diwali] is actually a religious event but this Saturday is more of a celebration," said Tejus Rao, the vice president of ISA.

Diwali 2007 will take place Nov. 17 at 5:30 p.m. at the Julius Littman Performing Arts Center on 17011 NE 19th Ave. Presale tickets cost $10 and $15 at the door. 	

"We wanted to make it as economical as possible for people to attend," said Abhishek Sinha, the public relations chair for ISA.

Considered the Hindu New Year, according to Sinha, Diwali is a religious holiday traditionally observed by Hindus, Sikhs and Jains; and  it takes its roots in the victory of good over evil within the soul. It is known as the festival of lights because of lamps that are lit and placed outside one's home to signify the triumph of good. 

The ISA has hosted a Diwali event since the early 1990s, according to Sinha. Essentially, the group removed the religious aspects of the holiday from their show and has viewed it as a time of simple celebration. The same is true in India where it is treated as a festival and celebrated regardless of a person's faith. 

"It's a time where everyone comes together," Rao said. 

This year, the celebration takes on a deeper meaning as India celebrates its 60th anniversary of freedom. Because of the special significance of this year, event organizers have tried to incorporate every aspect of India into the show. 

During the show, attendees can expect a myriad of performances ranging from Bollywood dance numbers, a fashion show and a new hip hop segment.

The ISA expects around 900 people to attend their Diwali 2007 show.	

"We've been preparing for the show for the past three months," Sinha said.  "A lot of people auditioned. It was really hard to make the cuts."

Besides the varying entertainment, attendees will be able to have a taste of real Indian cuisine if they arrive by 5:30 p.m. The Indian food will be served from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. and organizers encourage attendees to enjoy the food, as the show will not have an intermission. 

"This is a big production," Sinha said. "There are a lot of things and a lot of laughs. This show is about everything India has gone through."

For those interested in learning more about Diwali and Diwali 2007 the ISA will be hosting a general meeting devoted to the subject Nov. 15 at 5 p.m. in the Graham Center, room 314.  Tickets to Diwali 2007 will also be on sale during the meeting. 

The fun won't stop with Diwali 2007 as the ISA is also hosting an after party at Studio A on 60 NE 11th St. Admission to the after party is $10 a person. You must be 18 years old to enter and 21 to drink. 

"You don't have to be Indian or Hindu to enjoy the show," Sinha said. "It's a show everyone can enjoy."

Headline: Planning Ahead: Architects plan for Cuban reconstruction
Author: Xavier Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Many Cuban exiles agree the city of Havana has suffered profoundly since Fidel Castro took power in 1959. Within the capital, thousands of Cubans are living in rundown buildings that have stood still in time for more than half a century. A typical two-bedroom apartment with broken windows, no air conditioning or refrigerator and gaping holes in its' roof can sometimes house up to three or four families at once. 

According to Nicol&aacute;s Quintana, an architecture professor, Cuba will need major structural reconstruction after the fall of Castro's regime. 

Quintana, a Cuban-exile during the 1960s, said he has laid out the framework that may reshape Havana's cityscape over the next 20 years. His project, Havana and Its Landscapes, is the first realistic attempt at developing an organized model of how the city should develop after Castro dies.  

"Havana has been slowly destroyed by abandonment and negligence, but it will be even further destroyed if suddenly huge amounts of money come in without any guidance," said Quintana, who's been working as a registered architect for 56 years.

With that in mind, a main goal of the massive research project is to protect Havana from an uncontrolled building frenzy that could occur if the doors of development are suddenly swung open. Havana and Its Landscapes, which started August 2004, is a proposal designed mostly by Quintana and architecture students that gives guidelines for builders interested in constructing a post-Castro Cuba. 

"I told my students: imagine you are the best architects in the world and they told you to do your best project on this corner.  Then I let them loose and the outcomes were amazing," said Quintana. 

Over the last four semesters, Quintana has worked with approximately 60 FIU students on this project. 

Students entering his level-four design course are split into groups and given a specific spot within Havana to work on. Then, the students are shown pictures of whatever dilapidated building stands there now and they must generate an idea and model of what building should go up and how it can help stimulate Cuban economy.  

"This project really opens your eyes into consideration of not only your design, but also the people who live there and will be using your space," said Fernando Mane, a senior in professor Quintana's class. "My site is based around the castle on Havana's north shore. We're creating an amphitheatre with the castle as its backdrop." 

The result of the students work with Havana and Its Landscape is 35 models and 62 minutes of computer animation depicting the new Havana. The value of a single minute of computer animation is around $10,000, according to Quintana.  

"The faculty thought I was crazy when I told them I wanted my students to do the work. 

I just gave them the room to run with it and if you saw the animations on these computers you'd be astounded," Quintana said.    In order for a project like this to be realistic, Quintana needed thousands of up-to-date Havana photographs. 

The need for pictures came to mind with Quintana's plan to redesign El Malecon, Havana's northern shore. Three weeks later he had the entire shore - house-by-house and picture-by-picture - on his computer; an astonishing seven miles of photographs.

"You need the cooperation of many people for something like this. I couldn't have done this without the help of the Cuban people. If they're caught [by the Cuban government] they could end up 15 years in jail for helping," Quintana said.

The three-phase project looks at the future of Cuba from several different viewpoints. Co-director of the project and dean of FIU's School of Architecture, Juan Bueno, researched the first phase, which looked at Havana from an ecological perspective. 

He provided Quintana with vital information on where Cuba's ecosystem could sustain structural development. They then invited Phillipe Prestamo, a retired University of Miami professor, to study the sociopolitical structure of Havana. His research focused on how communities and municipalities should be structured after Castro dies. Quintana led the final phase, which was all the architecture and actual structuring of the city itself.  

This semester, Quintana's class is working on a plan to redesign the Bay of Havana from an industrial area into a fully tourist region.

"It will be a huge economic power to initiate rapidly the recovery of Cuba," Quintana said.

The final cost for the entire project is an estimated $505,000. Funding has come primarily from a joint grant between Sergio Pino, chairman of Century Partners Group, one of South Florida's top developers and Lennar Homes, a leading homebuilder throughout the nation. Both Quintana and Pino agree the project is a bargain at that price.

"Sergio and I calculated that if we would have contracted a firm and paid $16 an hour for these model-makers the costs for this project would be well over $800,000," Quintana said. 

"I'm happy to be a part of it. They're making sure that whenever we have an opportunity to go back to Cuba we do it right, without going all over the place and building stuff that doesn't make sense," Pino said.

Quintana and Pino met in 2004 when Pino, who at the time was a member of FIU's Board of Trustees, decided to take Quintana's architecture of the Americas course. During that semester, Pino became intrigued when Quintana would talk about his hopes of reconstructing Cuba.

"One day when we finished class, he approached me and asked, 'How much will that dream of yours for Havana cost?' I said I'm not sure but it should cost about $400,000. Then he said, 'Well you already have half of it,' Quintana said.  "That's how this whole thing got started."

Throughout his career Quintana has designed buildings in Cuba, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. He's worked on over 200 projects, such as designing the city of Caricuao, just outside Caracas and the Roberto Clemente Coliseum, an enourmous concert arena in San Juan.

Quintana warns Cuba will need approximately one million more homes to accommodate its current population; that's between $40 and $50 billion in constructions costs, with $8 to $10 billion of repairs solely in Havana. According to Quintana, if no one controls the surge of money coming into Havana after Castro dies, the results could be detrimental to the historical look of the city. 

"We are not giving final conclusions. We are only giving lines of orientation and recommendations. The conclusions will have to be formed in Cuba by Cubans," said Quintana.

Quintana plans to exhibit all the finished models and computer animations at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum sometime in late 2008.

Headline: Three Day Class Schedule: Implemented change meets mixed reviews
Author: Patricia Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the first semester of the Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule nearly at an end, some students are wishing it had never begun in the first place. 

"I can't believe that I have to drive all the way to FIU for a class that's 50 minutes long," said Melissa Dizon, a junior majoring in nursing. "I never even have time to talk to my professor after the lecture because I have to run to my next class." 

Melissa Wright - also a junior majoring in nursing - agreed.

"Ten minutes between classes is not enough time," Wright said. "I have to go all the way from the trailer complex in University Park to the Graham Center. Anyone familiar with FIU knows that is not enough time." 

The consideration for a new schedule began as a result of a report released in Spring 2005. 

The Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, the investigative arm of the Florida Legislature, conducted a study on how well Florida's 11 State universities were utilizing their classroom space. 

FIU came in last place with a classroom utilization rate of 42.5 percent in the OPPAGA report. As of 2005, the state average was 54 percent.

FIU appointed a Classroom Space Utilization Committee in Spring 2006, consisting of University faculty and staff members, to come up with a solution to the classroom utilization problem.

"The committee was charged with bringing the classroom utilization rate to the state average, if not more," said Corinne Webb, chair of the CSUC. "We analyzed every aspect of the situation and decided to go further than just creating a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule."  

The CSUC issued its official report April 6, 2006, which included recommendations to invest funds to enhance instructional state-of-the-art multimedia capabilities in classrooms, an annual class schedule as opposed to the current term-to-term schedule to help students plan and progress toward graduation in a timely manner and maximize classroom utilization to enable FIU to remain competitive for future building requests, known as PECO funding. 

The CSUC report states that a total of 2,277 class meetings can be gained in FIU with the new schedule implementation. 

"We applied the schedule to UP and [the Biscayne Bay Campus] to promote ease in the situation for the students and the faculty," Webb said. "We wanted to create a schedule that was standard in FIU."

Webb stands firm by the committee's decision to implement the MWF schedule. 

She views it as a positive change for FIU.

"Looking at it from a holistic approach, I feel that it has created a sense of greater academic activity and connectedness," Webb said. "It is obvious when you walk through the campus."

To make the transition easier for students FIU has already implemented changes such as asking vendors to adjust their schedules and negotiating a new inter-campus shuttle schedule, according to Webb.

Although the committee insists this is the only way to fix the classroom utilization problem at FIU, professors have shown mixed feelings.

Howard Rock, a professor for the History department, feels that the new schedule has created better campus spirit and is impressed with how full GC gets on Fridays. 

"Believe it or not, we are the last university in Florida to incorporate the new schedule," Rock said. 

It helps students stay focused, especially in the lower division classes. 

The classes are shorter, so they are easier to handle for the students coming in fresh from high school."

In contrast, professor Dev Roy, associate professor for the Mathematics department, does not support the MWF implementation. 

He has gone as far as developing his own model for a class schedule based on a two-day format alternating between Monday, Wednesday; Wednesday, Friday; and Monday, Friday at 75 minutes each. 

The complete model of the three day schedule is posted on his at www.fiu.edu/~royd. 

"A 50-minute block is too short to develop material in many disciplines," Roy said. "The three-day schedule is also inefficient logistically, allowing only 10 minutes between classes and requiring commuting to campus more often. This wastes time and fuel." 

Dawn Addy, director of the Labor Center, agrees that the new schedule does not lend itself to the learning process.

"I use videos in my classes and there is no time to discuss them afterwards; 50 minutes is not enough time to reach a deep discussion," Addy said.

It also adds to the financial burden of the students who have to pay for gas. They spend more time on the road that they could spend studying." 

Although FIU's classroom utilization rate has now been estimated to have surpassed the 54 percent state average, according to Webb. not all students are satisfied with the changes made. 

"I try to eliminate the amount of times I drive to school because of how expensive gas is," said Stephanie Fojo, a hospitality management graduate. "Right now I'm not being affected by the new schedule."

I stay away from classes scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, Friday. I feel bad for the students who have no choice but to take the classes."

Headline: Art show exhibits 'card' paintings
Author: Kevin Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Emphasizing on the artistic abilities of students, the Master's Mystery Art Show (MMAS) has returned for its fourth year to Miami. 

MMAS is an international event that began in 2003 that features thousands of original postcards created by artists, galleries, collectors and celebrities from around the globe, according to Venessa Monokian, an FIU graduate from the visual arts department who is helping develop the MMAS. 

"The whole University gets involved, even Modesto Maidique submits cards," said David King, a drawing professor. 

The MMAS allows anyone to submit artwork drawn on a six by nine inch postcard. The cards will be sold for $50 and the night they are sold, the identity of the artist will be revealed. 

"This creates an artistic 'who done it' guessing game which the public is free to participate in," Monokian said.

Funds raised at the show help FIU's Graduate Program and also raise awareness of MMAS, the only show of its kind hosted by a public university in South Florida. 

The program's proceeds help graduate students with traveling grants, scholarships and other financial assistance so that they can participate in art conferences held throughout the nation, according to Monokian.

"The Masters Mystery Art Show has allowed the graduate students of the program to hold numerous shows in the Miami Design District and to be a part of Art Miami 2007," Monokian said.

According to Monokian, funds raised have also helped Bill Burke, director of MMAS, to create a regular series of visiting artists and a workshop where artists are invited to give lectures to graduate students.

The MMAS started as an adaptation to a fundraising method used by the Royal College of Art, a university in London, England, according to Carol Damian, professor of art history, as well as faculty committee member for the MMAS.

"The purpose of the show is not only to expose the world to the art of FIU, but also to give graduate students the exposure to the business side of art," said Jacek Kolasinski, an assistant professor for the School of Art and Art History. 

According to Kolasinski, opening night is not to be missed. 

"Opening night is filled with hundreds of people walking among the aisles of artwork and picking out their favorite cards," Kolasinski said. "Even people staying in the Ritz-Carlton have been known to look through the displays of artwork while they are being set up and pick out their favorites. 

They respond better when they find out that it is to help graduate students"

The Master's Mystery Art show will start Dec. 6 and run through Dec 7.

Subheadline: Golden Panthers face last year's mediocre opponent
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
With so many negatives and a small list of positives this season, the football team looks to even its all-time homecoming record to 3-3 with its first win of the season. 

For a team that has lost 21 consecutive games, winning should be the goal worthy of noting. 

The Golden Panthers      (0-9, 0-4 Sun Belt) host the Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns (2-8, 2-3) Nov. 17 at the Orange Bowl in their sixth homecoming in their short existence. 

FIU is coming off a heartbreaking 27-24 last second loss to Arkansas State two weeks ago while the Ragin' Cajuns are riding high after a surprise 34-24 victory last week over Middle Tennessee. 

While FIU has had four lopsided losses this season, they have played their Sun Belt Conference opponents very closely. Their past homecoming games have been both close and lopsided. 

The inaugural homecoming football game in 2002 saw the Golden Panthers lose 17-14 to Gardner-Webb University. FIU came out the second year and beat Holy Cross 34-23. The 2004 game was a major disappointment as Georgia Southern trampled FIU 53-32. The following year was the team's second victory on this important day, squeaking past Western Kentucky 38-35. 

Finally, last year the Ragin' Cajuns came out on top 17-7. Five games in and FIU sports a 2-3 record on homecoming games. Although one can argue that homecoming in college is not as glamorous as that of high school, this is a critical game for FIU because of its skeptical fan base. Sure, it isn't easy to get motivated for a team that hasn't won in two years, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. 

Coach Mario Cristobal has done his very best with such a young and talent-deprived team. His attitude and aspirations are very positive and his belief in success is what should keep fans interested. 

This homecoming contest is definitely a realistic win if FIU can feed off the positives from its previous game. The team put up 24 points in its last game, which was a season high, and quarterback Wayne Younger continued to flash his promising speed. 

The Ragin' Cajuns is also a struggling team and have won just two games this season. One week they get dominated against Arkansas State and then another week they come out with an impressive win against a decent team in Middle Tennessee. Keeping this in mind, the Golden Panthers simply need to prove themselves on the field and all other factors surrounding the game are irrelevant. 

It is imperative that they put points on the board and for the defense to rebound after a lackluster performance in the previous game. 

In order for FIU to finally get a win, the team must duplicate last game's offensive performance with Younger using his legs.

 Regardless, this game has the potential to be a close one. As past homecomings have shown, and particularly last year as a prime example, the Golden Panthers will do everything in their power to obtain a victory. 

From a fans point of view, it would be nice to finally witness a win and to even up the overall homecoming record. 

For the team's sake, it is imperative to focus solely on the game and ignore all the distracting hoopla. Knowing Cristobal, he will surely make sure that his troops have this mentality during the week and during the game itself.

Headline: Women's basketball: FIU 70, Lynn 62
Subheadline: Guards lead squad to first victory of season
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The women's basketball team kicked off its season with a 70-62 win over Lynn University at the Pharmed Arena Nov. 10. Junior guard LaQuetta Ferguson led the team with 24 points and Iva Ciglar contributed with a 14-point, 10-assist double-double.  

FIU started the game with Ciglar, Antonia Zeigler, Monika Bosilj, Elisa Carey and Maja Krajacic. The game did not start out well for the Golden Panthers, because from the opening tip-off the defense seemed confused and Lynn scored on an easy lay-up that put FIU down 2-0 only seconds into its first game of the season. 

The slow start continued and FIU did not take the lead until 14 minutes into the game when a free-throw by Ferguson made the score 10-9. Following the game coach Cindy Russo was frustrated by the way her team played most of the game. 

"Right now we have no chemistry," she said. "They are totally out of sync. We are playing a brand new team right now. I don't expect them to have a whole lot of chemistry. I think we are a work-in-progress all year long."   

The teams went into halftime tied at 31. Lynn University's Jade Williams and FIU's Ciglar lead the first half scorers with 12 points each. 

The game was still close early in the second half as the teams continued to trade leads. FIU finally seemed to hit a rhythm coming off of a timeout down 39-35. The Golden Panthers then went on a 9-0 run that was capped of by a 3-point shot from freshman Fanni Hutlassa. However, Lynn rallied and the score would again be tied at 49 with 9:30 left in the game.

With the score so close and with three-fourths of the game already in the books, Russo sent in freshman Tabitha Drake into the game. Drake had only played for two minutes in the first half and had two fouls to show for it. Drake would score FIU's next seven points making three shots on three attempts, one of which was a 3-pointer that put FIU up 56-52.

Then Ferguson went on a scoring spree and put up 12 points in the final four minutes. Seven of those points came from the foul line, where Ferguson finished the night a perfect 8-for-8. Those free throws would be the difference in a 70-62 Golden Panther win.

Following the game Ciglar was one of many upperclassmen on the team impressed with the way that Drake and the other freshmen did in their FIU debuts.

"I think the freshmen did an excellent job today," Ciglar said. "They came out with swagger and confidence. I would like to mention Tabitha Drake; she did amazing. She went out there like she was doing it for 30 years." 

After the game, Drake was humble about having such an impact in here first career game.

"I feel like it was a great accomplishment for us to actually come and win this game." Drake said. "It was hard, but we pulled through and we did it."

Drake was not the only player who made their FIU debut that night. Krajacic started, played nine minutes and recorded a rebound and a steal. Liene Jekabsone played only four minutes. She scored on her only shot of the night on a nice low post move reminiscent of her big sister Lasma, who played for FIU last season. 

Fanni Hutlassa played 23 minutes, which was the most that any of the freshmen played, and recorded seven points and four rebounds. 

Elisa Carey led all players with 10 rebounds. Marquita Adley scored six points and had five rebounds. Jasmine Jenkins had four points and four rebounds. Lynn University was lead by William's 22 points and she also tied for a team led with five rebounds. 

Coming up next for FIU will be the DePaul invitational in Chicago on Nov. 15 and 17.

Headline: Men's basketball FIU 80, Florida tech 64
Subheadline: New center powers team past first opponent
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's basketball team (1-0) began its season with a 80-66 victory over the Florida Tech Panthers (0-1) Nov. 12 at the Pharmed Arena. 

The limelight for the night was focused on the regular season debut of 7-foot center Russell Hicks, a junior transfer out of Pepperdine University. Hicks delivered exactly what coach Sergio Rouco was looking for as an efficient inside presence who could keep up with the up-tempo basketball the team utilizes. He finished the night with 16 points on 7-of-9 shooting and seven rebounds.

Justin Sedlak of Florida Tech gave the Golden Panthers fits early on, reaching double digits in scoring within the first 10 minutes and repeatedly denying Hicks from making an impact on the game offensively. 

A switch to zone defense and the solid play of Nikola Gacesa put an end to Sedlak's effectiveness, only scoring nine more points the rest of the game. 

As great as the newcomer's play was, it was the seasoned veteran Chris Fuller who turned in a career night with nine points, nine assists, more than doubling his previous personal record, and four rebounds.

Meanwhile, Erick Nsangou was a force coming off the bench, finishing with 15 points, three rebounds and two assists.

"Nsangou is unbelievable for us," said coach Sergio Rouco. "He should be starting in front of a few guys, but what he brings off the bench is unbelievable and we can't change that."

Kenneth "Red" White, a transfer out of Texas A&M University, also made his debut for FIU. White fouled out late in the game and was unable to find any sort of rhythm on offense, going 2-for-6 with six points. However, he delivered one of the highlights of the game with a drive to the basket that closed out the first half and gave FIU a double-digit lead heading into the locker room.

Rouco made sure all players had their chance to contribute, with all 10 that were suited up seeing playing time by the end of the first half and nine putting points up on the board. 

The victory continued FIU's dominance in the head-to-head series against Florida Tech, extending its lead to 12-0 all time. Perhaps more importantly, it put the Golden Panthers at 2-2 in season openers and 4-0 in home openers under the tenure of Rouco.	

The team takes on Kennesaw State next Wed. Nov. 21 at the Pharmed Arena.

Headline: Commentary: Men's basketball team combines height and shooting
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's first basketball game of the season was a close contest until late in the first half when FIU started to pull away from Florida Tech. Following a lay-up and subsequent foul shot from Kenneth White, FIU gained its first double-figure lead of the night. The Golden Panthers would never look back from that lead and won the game convincingly. 

It is clear that this year FIU has some real weapons, especially on offense. The Golden Panthers have some great shooters. White, Michael James, Tremayne Russell, Erick Nsangou, Chris Fuller and Alex Galindo all hit a 3-pointers in the season opener Nov. 12. That's six players who could be perimeter threats this season, especially with the added height on the roster.

FIU is also packed with great role players such as quick point guards who can pass, shot and drive with James and Russell. 

Galindo and Fuller are great shooters and can play just about any position. The biggest addition to this year's team, 7-foot center Russell Hicks, who is able to dominate the low-post and has an arsenal of inside moves. 

Against Florida Tech, all the role players played their roles well en route to a well-earned win. However, following the game, coach Sergio Rouco and the rest of the coaching staff were disappointed by the defensive effort and were worried that the players are only thinking about how many points they can score. "Kids in college judge games on how many points they score and if you have too many guys judging games by how many points they score its not going to be healthy for the team," Rouco said.

Another concern after this game might be free-throw shooting. Overall, FIU shot 62 percent on 15-of-24 shooting and was mainly hurt by Fuller's 4-for-9 and Nsangou's 6-for-10. 

Rouco even referred to the teams foul shooting as the team's Achilles' heel. 

Free-throw shooting will need to improve as both Fuller and Nsangou are key players who handle the ball a lot.

 FIU shot 50 percent for the game from the field and 38 percent from 3-point land.

The best thing about the game was really the teams star players living up to some of their hype. Galindo had a great season last year and was a preseason All Sun Belt second team selection this year. 

He scored 15 points and pulled down four rebounds despite having that spotlight on him. Hicks came into the game as the 7-foot transfer student that has the skill to go with that long frame. On a side note, Hicks was not even the tallest basketball player in Pharmed Arena that night as Florida Tech sports 7-7 Paul Sturgess from England on its roster, but he did not play.

Things are definitely looking up for FIU this season. This team will be able to win games in a variety of ways,  whether it's in a defensive struggle or with a rainbow 3-pointer up at the buzzer.

Headline: ELEVATOR WOES: Standard fixtures, noise levels leave residents vexed
Author: Nicolle Garber / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
I'm certain that Chewbacca and a velociraptor are engaged in a vicious battle in the left elevator of Lakeview North.  

Their painful cries and rusty, ear bleeding screeches, sounding all day and night have convinced me of the epic battle raging on.

But all funny business aside, a building boasting state-of-the-art technology and an estimated $4,288 price tag a semester should not be having such problems.

Mary Myers, a sophomore who lived in Lakeview South and currently lives in Lakeview North, is all too familiar with malfunctioning elevators. 

"It sounds like a velociraptor," Myers said. 

We both hear the disturbing sound penetrate the halls and rooms.

The elevator noises would not bother me nor any other student if the walls in our dorms didn't echo the cacophonous shrieking with resounding perfection. 

The constant noise led to a questioning of the price students pay and the quality we receive: they don't seem to add up.

To attain answers, I spoke with James Wassenaar, executive director for student affairs operations and auxiliary services. Wassenaar could not answer on how the money was distributed.  

Likewise, Wassenaar was unable to elaborate on why the cost of dorming was so expensive nor why the quality of the walls did not reflect the price. 

 As an executive, I assumed this information would be easily accessible to him; apparently it is not, and is seemingly confidential.

Hypothetically, at approximately $4,000 per person, about four people per suite and approximately 10 suites per floor, Lakeview generates a rough estimate of $16,000. 

Multiply this number by six for six floors, and you arrive at a rough $960,000. 

With so much money generated, I was concerned as to why the quality of standard fixtures is pitiful. Wassenaar was unable to comment on this as well.

He stated the building is made with cement and drywall and how it is like any other building with 500 or so residents. 

I disagree. 

Living in apartments and duplexes all of my life, the walls, even in the oldest buildings, never felt as thin as Lakeview's dorms, and still were considerably cheaper.

Wassenaar did state, "All fees collected are dedicated to resident halls, with the best price [for housing costs] possible."  

I wonder who this 'best price' is for, the students? He never specified but from my experience this 'best price' is not the 'best'.

About the elevator and safety, he commented, "It's not a safety issue. It's a hydraulic pump, not an elevator with cables." 

When I questioned why the price for housing is relatively expensive, and therefore an elevator problem should be non-existent, Wassenaar blamed the company that provides the elevator services, ThyssenKrupp.

"They are responsible.  [It's] apart of a new construction package. Lakeview has documented problems and repair request logs, and [we have] met with senior management to try and understand why these problems persist," Wassenaar said.

'Persist' is the key word in that statement. Housing is not cheap but the perpetual problems of defective elevators after an entire year, and walls which seem to be created to echo and annoy residents, is unacceptable. 

When asked about the elevator sounds, Joel Perez, service manager for ThyssenKrupp's Miami company said it was a hot topic.  

"The rails were just rough and needed to be grinded and sanded down. The rails were eating away at the guide shoe insert." 

As for the elevator possibly becoming stuck, he said, "It'll just make noise but it won't stop."

As comforting as Perez's words were, it is unacceptable to have these minor and highly irritating problems occur. 

As a dorm generating nearly $1 million, not spending the money to at least build walls with decent sound insulation, I find this troubling. 

It is unfair to residents who take out hefty loans to attend school in a convenient manner.

We are the students and the students are what make a University; we are what makes FIU.  

In that respect, the University should take our well-being to heart, and provide us with housing  of a quality that is equal to the amount of money spent on it.
