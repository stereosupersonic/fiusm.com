Headline: Women's basketball in first place with win over Middle Tennessee
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The women's basketball team dropped one game and won another in conference play this past week. FIU knocked off Middle Tennessee to secure a spot atop the the Sun Belt's East Division after falling to first place Western Kentucky.

FIU 65, Middle Tenn. 63

Ivelina Vrancheva tied a career-high with 20 points as FIU escaped with a 65-63 victory over Middle Tennessee on Saturday afternoon at Golden Panther Arena. FIU (15-6, 6-2) moved into a first-place tie with Western Kentucky with the victory.

Vrancheva scored FIU's final five points, which included a three-point play with one minute remaining in the contest, to secure the win.

The Lady Raiders (11-10, 4-4) led by 12 points with 16:44 remaining before the Golden Panthers used a 19-2 run over the next six minutes to take a seven-point advantage. Middle Tennessee took a three-point lead with 7:29 left before Vrancheva went on to score nine of FIU's final 17 points.

Anita Heller had 13 points for FIU while Mandy Shafer added 10. Patrice Holmes posted her fifth career double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds for the Lady Raiders.

West. Ken. 80, FIU 68

Tiffany Porter-Talbert tied a career high with 23 points as Western Kentucky moved into first place in the Sun Belt Conference's East Division after defeating FIU 80-68 on Thursday night.

WKU (11-8, 6-2) never trailed in the game. The team turned the ball over a season-low 12 times as the Lady Toppers won for the first time in three years in Golden Panther Arena.

Porter-Talbert shot 9-of-13 from the floor and pulled down seven rebounds. Leslie Logsdon posted 19 points. Shala Reese added 16 for WKU.
Cormisha Cotton led FIU with 17 points and eight rebounds. Milena Tomova posted career highs with 12 points and four blocked shots. The Golden Panthers had four players in double-figure scoring.

Headline: Men's basketball drops two games; Team still winless in conference play
Author: Daisy Fernandez
&nbsp;
Games in Kentucky and Tennessee were disappointing for the Golden Panthers. As of Saturday night, the team has dropped to a 6-13, 0-6 Sun Belt record.

On Thursday, FIU fell to the Hilltoppers of Western Kentucky, 63-43. 

The first half, which closed with a score of 20-18, was competitive. The Hilltoppers, who managed a 15-9 run, challenged FIU's two-point lead in the tenth minute. Golden Panther Carlos Morban and forward Carlos Fernandez made steals and transition baskets that narrowed the WKU advantage before the half was over. 

At the end of the half, guard Slavtcho Slavtchev made a three-pointer, which left FIU with a chance to come back after halftime. 

However, the second half was dominated by WKU. In the last ten minutes of the game, the Hilltoppers extended what began as a seven-point lead to 20. The efforts of Morban and forward Euliz Baez reduced FIU's deficit to 51-34.
"In the second half, WKU cranked up its defense and we didn't match it," said head coach Donnie Marsh. 

Baez recorded nine rebounds, the highest of the game. 
FIU played a close game in Murfreesboro, where it lost by only two points against Middle Tennessee, 60-58. 

The Blue Raiders, who managed an early nine-point advantage, controlled the first eight minutes on the floor. Morban and Baez recorded the first points for FIU, before the Blue Raiders rose again with 15 points on their side. 

FIU fought back with a 7-0 run, and narrowed MTSU's winning margin before the closing of the first half at 32-25. In this half, Baez posted 11 points while Matias and Morban each contributed with six. Early in the second half, Matias tied the game for the Golden Panthers at 32. After earning his fourth foul, he was benched for the next five minutes. Belco Bamba was also dismissed from the game for his fifth foul in the contest. 

Middle Tennessee pulled itself up again with five points by Marcus Robinson. With three minutes left, FIU struck back with a 13-6 run and accomplished two other ties: one at 55, another at 57. With barely a second left, Baez attempted a shot that was not accepted by game officials.  A foul shot by Napoleon Rhodes secured the narrow 60-58 win for the Blue Raiders. Junior Matias reached the highest points for FIU--a total of 16 points. He was followed by Euliz Baez, who posted 15 points and 11 rebounds. Carlos Morban also scored in the double figures with 10 points.

Headline: Iraq: The Essential Part of the War on Terrorism
Subheadline:  
Author: thedrdrew@netzero.com
&nbsp;
I would like to start by thanking President George Walker Bush for looking out for our future and the future of generations to follow with his bravery and leadership on the War on Terrorism. It is this very reason that there is opposition to this ensuing war on Iraq. The opposition against the war on Iraq is purely for political reasons. I will outline some key highlights. First of all, the protest ralley that was put on by ANSWR and the Nazi/Worker's World party illustrated all of the racism and bigotry of the remaining liberals and the liberals-in-hiding of the Democratic party. The protest ralley had Democratic presidential candidates like Revered Al "the Bigot" Sharpton. I was watching to see if they would present any rational argument against this war, but as usual it was all emotion and an all-out attack. It was an attack on Bush and the Bush family--claiming oil interests.

The political/liberal argument is represented in other ways--and represented by nations with short-term memories. Lets look at two nations: Germany and France. The French are a bunch of weasles and panzies. That will never change. They have an anti-American agenda. They hate America and everything it stands for anyway. Both Germany and France obviously did not learn the lesson that Adolf Hitler--another cruel dictator--taught them. It was America who liberated them through a regime change--and it was America who helped nation build these countries. And how do they repay us? By rewarding Saddam Hussein. First of all, France's reservation is for obvious reasons. They have an oil agreement with Adolf Hussein--which by the way undermined sanctions. We won't forget this when we go into Iraq next week or the following week and liberate this nation the same way we liberated France and Germany.  

But what must be explored is the INTENT here. Do Germany and France make a good case? They claim that war is not an option. But did they forget how nazism was destroyed? Historically, freedom was not obtained without spillage of blood. It is called PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. America liberated itself from being a colony of the British and started a democracy--by defeating the British. We did not simply say "Stop it or else we will write 12 declarations." The same people who oppose this war would have opposed war against the British. Why? They are weasles and panzies. They are not brave at all. But you can be certain that these liberal weasles are loving every minute of the freedoms they have today.   

This brings us to a final important point. The war on terrorism will be won by Conservatism and not liberalism/socialism. By fighting for our freedom instead of talking about freedom through resolutions we will win this war. If we adopt France's and Germany's amnesia democracy itself--what America has fought for--will be dead forever.

Headline: FIU places second in Fun & Sun Classic
Author: Daisy Fern√°ndez
&nbsp;
FIU participated in the Diamond Sports Fun & Sun Softball Classic, a tournament in which the Bulldogs of Georgia came out victorious. The  Bulldogs were named champions, as they picked up a win against the Golden Panthers on Sunday, 5-1. 

Georgia's Michelle Green was voted MVP. Against FIU, she crowned six hits and struck out 10. Jennifer Owens made the only run for FIU in the fourth inning.  

On Saturday night, FIU defeated Illinois State, 7-3, at University Park. 
The Golden Panthers had 10 batters on the plate, as the team scored in abundance in the fourth inning. In it, FIU succeeded in achieving five homeruns. The inning was characterized by two-run singles by two juniors, Cindy Turek and Amber Gill. 

The fifth inning provoked sophomore Marleah Stapf to make her first run of the year. Pitcher Amanda Nealer played in five innings that night, in which she recorded two strikeouts and three runs.

Despite the win over Illinois State, the Golden Panthers lost   against Georgia on Friday. Georgia, which is ranked 17th, had previously secured its victory against Illinois State, 1-0.

When FIU first played Georgia, Michelle Tyree   recorded a two-run homer for the Bulldogs, which left FIU with only one run on its side. 

Pitcher Kendra Laminank let Georgia make seven hits and three runs in that game.

Headline: El LACC abre sus telones
Subheadline: Robert Valencia
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
ZONA: Hay personas que saben que el Centro Latinoamericano y del Caribe (LACC) existe pero no conocen a fondo sus actividades. Otras, simplemente, no saben que existe. Defina en sus propias palabras lo que es LACC.

Eduardo Gamarra (EG): Primero que todo me preocupa que me digas eso, ya que esta es una instituci√≥n cuya nomenclatura es de centro, ya que el centro viene primero y las instituciones son subordinados al centro. Pero LACC, y perdona que lo diga con tanta arrogancia, es el centro de mayor prestigio que tiene FIU, y tambi√©n uno de los centros mas antiguos, creado en 1979 y fundado bajo el liderazgo de quien es actualmente el Viceprovost, el se√±or Mark Rosemberg.

Otros profesores estuvieron en ese entonces y ahora forman parte del liderazgo de esta universidad, como el decano del Colegio de Artes y Ciencias, al igual que intelectuales del Caribe. De manera que LACC le ha dado una posici√≥n a FIU nacional e internacionalmente, o sea que cuando me dices que hay personas que no conocen a LACC me preocupa un poco, no me sorprende pero si me preocupa.

FIU tiene una concentraci√≥n de 136 profesores que trabajan sobre Am√©rica Latina, son profesores de tiempo completo, que trabajan desde el √°rea del periodismo hasta ciencias pol√≠ticas, ingenier√≠a y negocios. Todos estos son profesores asociados del centro. Si uno considera los profesores que trabajan como adjuntos, es decir, que no trabajan a tiempo completo, el n√∫mero sobrepasar√≠a los  200 profesores. Esto quiere decir que FIU tiene una concentraci√≥n de profesores e investigadores sobre Am√©rica Latina y del caribe m√°s grande del pa√≠s, algo que es verdaderamente destacable. 

LACC es un centro financiado por el gobierno federal bajo una legislaci√≥n llamada el Titulo VI, que es una beca que se da cada tres a√±os y es extremadamente competitiva. Entre 300 y 500 instituciones compiten por este financiamiento y s√≥lo 19 acceden a la beca. Si quieres hacer un ranking nacional, nosotros estamos entre los primeros 19. Siempre le digo al presidente (de FIU) Modesto Maidique de nuestra posici√≥n a nivel nacional.

ZONA: Precisamente usted menciona proyectos de LACC fuera y dentro del pa√≠s. ¬øCu√°les son los proyectos m√°s importantes de LACC?

EG: Tenemos varios proyectos, entre ellos acerca del terrorismo, en particular, el impacto del terrorismo sobre la Florida. Este proyecto es financiado por el gobierno federal, con un √°ngulo latinoamericano. Aparte de este proyecto, tenemos ocho institutos dentro del centro, por ejemplo, el centro de estudios Colombianos, en donde se trata el tema de la di√°spora colombiana, algo que fue noticia a nivel nacional, ya que medios como National Public Radio y NBC cubrieron este evento, incluso medios de comunicaci√≥n colombianos. Este proyecto fue iniciativa de estudiantes.ZONA: Ya que usted menciona estos programas, ¬øa qu√© personas o a qu√© estudiantes van dirigidos estos programas?

EG: Los proyectos de investigaci√≥n son impulsados por dos fuentes. La primera son los profesores que dictan nuestra agenda de investigaci√≥n, la docencia de esta universidad esta estrictamente relacionada con las investigaciones de los profesores. No obstante, queremos involucrar a los estudiantes en estas investigaciones, como es el caso del estudio de la di√°spora colombiana, donde involucramos a siete estudiantes. Como resultado de esta investigaci√≥n, hemos escrito seis tesis sobre Colombia. 

Tambi√©n tenemos una maestr√≠a de estudios latinoamericanos. Es una maestr√≠a muy competitiva. Encontramos estudiantes de todas partes, a quienes les proporcionamos becas y entrenamiento y, claro, cuando los proyectos son publicados, ellos reciben el reconocimiento. Parte de la l√≥gica ac√° es que nosotros tenemos que desarrollar una investigaci√≥n para que redunden tanto las investigaciones de los profesores como la de los mismos estudiantes.

ZONA: ¬øQue requisitos se necesitan para involucrarse a estos programas? 

EG: Por lo general, nuestros programas est√°n dirigidos a estudiantes de postgrado. Dentro del programa tenemos una serie de certificados, por ejemplo, cualquier estudiante puede obtener un certificado de estudios latinoamericanos con una concentraci√≥n en el MERCOSUR, tambi√©n un certificado con una concentraci√≥n en Cuba, en Hait√≠, o sea, hay una variedad de formas por las cuales los estudiantes que est√°n haciendo cursos extras sobre ciencias pol√≠ticas, negocios y en relaciones internacionales, no necesitan volverlas a tomar para obtener este certificado. Simplemente comparan los cursos que ya han tomado hacia el certificado. 

Tenemos alrededor de 300 estudiantes inscritos en los programas de certificado. Para una universidad latina con m√°s de 34,000 alumnos, 300 es nada, deber√≠amos tener m√≠nimo 1,000. Yo creo que, o no estamos haciendo lo suficiente para atraerlos, o simplemente como comenz√≥ esta entrevista, que no saben lo que es LACC, para mi esto es lamentable y estamos tratando en varios eventos de ver como reclutar estudiantes. A nivel de postgrado, obviamente estamos haciendo un trabajo enorme de reclutamiento, porque es una maestr√≠a muy competitiva, no aceptamos a todos los que se postulan, los requisitos est√°n subiendo y hay una competencia inmensa por entrar el programa. Los estudiantes en su mayor√≠a no son de FIU, hay estudiantes de varios estados de la Uni√≥n Americana, de Nueva Zelanda y varios estudiantes de Suram√©rica. Yo dir√≠a que menos del 10% de nuestros alumnos son estudiantes que se graduaron en FIU.             

Otros de los institutos que tiene LACC es el Summit of the Americas Center (SOAC) que promueve actividades de la Florida para fortalecer el comercio en el hemisferio. El Cuban Research Institute (CRI) es el primer centro en su clase en la naci√≥n. El Intercultural Dance and Music Institute, es un instituto que recluta artistas y profesores interesados en estudiar los diferentes aspectos culturales de la regi√≥n y de √Åfrica. Otro instituto importante del LACC es el Institute for Internacional Professional Services (IIPS), que lanz√≥ un consorcio entre universidades de Estados Unidos y Latinoam√©rica para fortalecer manejos de campa√±a pol√≠tica y pr√°cticas de excelencia a trav√©s del hemisferio.

Headline: Alimentos transg√©nicos, lucha de titanes
Subheadline: Milka Carrasquillo
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Datos de nutrici√≥n: 200 calor√≠as; 100 calor√≠as en grasa; 16 por ciento de grasas saturadas; siete por ciento de colesterol. Cero por ciento de vitamina A y C; cero calcio y dos por ciento de hierro. 

A juzgar por los datos, este alimento no parece muy saludable. La verdad, no lo es. Son los datos de nutrici√≥n de un perro caliente o "hot dog", que, seg√∫n los m√©dicos y nutricionistas, es una de las comidas m√°s da√±inas para la salud.

Sin embargo, el que lo come, sabe lo que est√° comiendo. Sabe que podr√≠a ser perjudicial para su salud porque hay una etiqueta que permite que el consumidor conozca los componentes -nutritivos o no-  de un producto en un supermercado. 

Pero cuando se habla de frutas, vegetales o verduras no es lo mismo. Estos alimentos podr√≠an ser transg√©nicos o "gen√©ticamente modificados" y no hay etiqueta, letrero o sello que los identifique como tal. 

"Estos productos vienen de las manufactureras y ni siquera nosotros sabemos por los procesos que han  pasado", asegura un gerente del supermercado Publix. Tampoco los miles de productos que est√°n hechos con alimentos transg√©nicos son identificados.

De ah√≠ parte la controversia entre las grandes potencias mundiales. Mientras Estados Unidos defiende e investiga esta tecnolog√≠a, los pa√≠ses europeos implantan regulaciones en la comercializaci√≥n de cualquier tipo de producto transg√©nico, abogando por el derecho de las personas de saber lo que consumen.

El debate

Estados Unidos es el primer productor de alimentos transg√©nicos en el mundo y da la cara al debate alegando la posible desaparici√≥n del hambre en el planeta. 

Durante la exportaci√≥n de los productos, puede ocurrir su maduraci√≥n, lo que causa p√©rdidas comerciales. Por el contrario, la biotecnolog√≠a aplicada a los alimentos vence al tiempo y reduce los da√±os. As√≠, cantidades mayores de productos pueden ser exportados y suplir las necesidades alimentarias de cada pa√≠s. 

Pero, a pesar de los intereses humanitarios y comerciales de Estados Unidos, el pa√≠s todav√≠a no le da el derecho al consumidor de saber si el producto que compra ha sido modificado gen√©ticamente o no. En mayo del pasado a√±o se someti√≥ un poyecto de ley a la C√°mara de Representantes en el Congreso para enmendar leyes que obliguen a identificar todo producto o alimento que est√© hecho o contenga ingredientes que hayan sido modificados gen√©ticamente. 

Por el contrario,  pa√≠ses que componen la Uni√≥n Europea (UE), Australia, China, Corea del Sur y Rusia han establecido mandatos para identificarlos. Estos pa√≠ses cuestionan la salubridad de los productos  y  los riesgos que corre el ambiente a consecuencia de los procesos.

&#8220;Contaminaci√≥n gen√©tica&#8221;

Aparte de los posibles da√±os que puede causar a la salud la biotecnolog√≠a, lo que s√≠ est√° comprobado es el peligro que corre el medio ambiente y otros cultivos por causa de este tipo de tecnolog√≠a. Esto es a lo que los opositores de la biotecnolog[ia le llaman &#8220;contaminaci√≥n gen√©tica&#8221;. 

Como explica el doctor Javier Francisco Ortega, profesor de ciencias de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida, las plantas transg√©nicas pueden tener un efecto sobre el medio ambiente si se diera el caso de que algunos de los alelos se escapen a parientes silvestres de las plantas cultivadas.  

El polen de las plantas que se propaga con el viento puede recorrer largas distancia, fertilizar plantas silvestres y producir especies m√°s resistentes y dif√≠ciles de controlar. 

Adem√°s, a trav√©s de accidentes y falta de controles adecuados, ciertas bacterias y virus podr√≠an escapar para reproducirse. 

Mientras cada pa√≠s sigue investigando las ventajas, los riesgos a la salud y al medio ambiente y otros posibles avances en la biotecnolog√≠a, el debate contin√∫a.

Se espera una fuerte reacci√≥n de los grupos defensores del consumidor en Europa cuando Estados Unidos denuncie a la UE ante la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de Comercio (OMC). La naci√≥n norteamericana est√° estudiando esta posibilidad por las pr√≥rrogas sobre la importaci√≥n de alimentos transg√©nicos. Los comerciantes aseguran que la moratoria viola las normas de la OMC.

En definitiva, la controversia toma fuerza cuando el planeta sigue en peligro por los cambios clim√°ticos, la salud no es tema de importancia en algunas naciones y el hambre en el mundo empeora a medida que los ricos se hacen m√°s ricos.

Headline: El hacedor de castillos de arena

&nbsp;
Un paseo a South Beach no estar√≠a completo sin una visita a la calle nueve y Ocean Drive. Ah√≠ se encuentra el castillo de arena de V√≠ctor Leong, considerado por muchos turistas y residentes de la zona como una parada obligada para tomar fotograf√≠as. 

El castillo est√° ubicado en la monta√±a gigante de arena que V√≠ctor vio hace algunos a√±os apilada en la pared de la playa mientras paseaba en bicicleta. Con mucho esfuerzo, logr√≥ convertirla en un castillo gigante y un equipo televisivo capt√≥ las im√°genes que lo inmortalizaron como uno de los tantos personajes ex√≥ticos de South Beach. 

V√≠ctor empez√≥ haciendo peque√±os castillos de arena cuando apenas era un ni√±o en las playas de California, donde viv√≠a con su padre. A temprana edad, se dio cuenta de su habilidad para tomar una monta√±a de arena y convertirla en pocas horas en un elaborado y majestuoso castillo. Por ensayo y error fue perfeccion√°ndolos y agrand√°ndolos poco a poco. Termin√≥ por mudarse a Miami y, por m√°s de diez a√±os, ha cautivado a los visitantes de la playa con sus maravillosas creaciones y ha logrado establecerse en la escena local como un artista talentoso.

En su opini√≥n, la arena de Miami Beach es perfecta porque es muy fina y tiene la cantidad adecuada de limo y arcilla. 

Para la construcci√≥n de sus castillos, V√≠ctor utiliza solamente agua y arena. Cada figura es moldeada por sus manos. El tiempo que le toma hacer un castillo es directamente proporcional al tama√±o del mismo. Un castillo de seis pies de alto y 10 de ancho, por ejemplo, le puede tomar casi ocho horas. El que exhibe en la playa le tom√≥ 30 horas.

Adem√°s de castillos de arena, V√≠ctor construye cometas, "zeppelins" (dirigibles), barcos dentro de botellas y galeones a escala que pueden navegar.

Tanta ha sido la acogida de su arte que el alcalde de Miami Beach, David Dermer, proclam√≥ el 19 de junio de 2002 como el d√≠a de V√≠ctor Leong y sus castillos de arena. 

Su obra ha servido tambi√©n para beneficiar a personas sin hogar que dorm√≠an a la intemperie. V√≠ctor les brind√≥ la oportunidad de cuidar por las noches el castillo a cambio de las propinas nocturnas. Con ese dinero y la ayuda de Johnny Starman, representante de V√≠ctor, los guardianes del castillo poseen ahora un techo donde dormir en South Beach. Algunos de ellos son aprendices que estudian las t√©cnicas para hacer castillos de arena.

V√≠ctor visit√≥ recientemente Florida International University (Biscayne Bay Campus), durante la "SPC-BBC Affair of the Arts Week", cuando construy√≥ un castillo a las afueras del Wolfe University Center. Estudiantes, profesores y curiosos de la elaboraci√≥n de castillos de arena apreciaron al artista trabajando y tomaron fotos una vez que su obra estuvo terminada casi al final de la tarde. 

Sin embargo, no todo ha sido f√°cil para el artista de 28 a√±os. Una vez la polic√≠a de la playa lo apres√≥ y llev√≥ su caso al City Hall. Seg√∫n cuenta, "todo sali√≥ bien" y el castillo pudo permanecer en el lugar. No obstante, la polic√≠a est√° tratando nuevamente de eliminar el castillo. Argumenta que su presencia ha aumentado el √≠ndice delictivo de la zona por la cantidad de gente que deambula y se re√∫ne para verlo. 

V√≠ctor y su representante est√°n recogiendo firmas para que de esta forma se mantenga el lugar tur√≠stico y m√°gico que ha fascinado a tantos visitantes. 	Descubrir los retos que enfrenta este artista cada vez que construye o retoca su obra, adem√°s de recibir algunos consejos en la elaboraci√≥n de castillos de arena son razones suficientes para visitarlo.

Headline: Crece industria cinematogr√°fica en Miami Beach
Subheadline: Awilda I. Castro Su√°rez
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
El municipio de Miami Beach ha enfilado sus ca√±ones hacia la industria del cine y busca vender la imagen de que posee los escenarios ideales que busca cada productor para rodar su proyecto. 

Este inter√©s hace que tengan una Oficina de Cine y Entretenimiento en distintos lugares de Florida, incluso una en la meca del celuloide, Hollywood, Los Angeles. Esta oficina est√° conformada por un Consejo de Cine y Entretenimiento, compuesto por 17 miembros (siete elegidos por el gobernador, cinco por el presidente del senado y cinco por el portavoz de los representantes). 

El Consejo provee consejer√≠a a los municipios sobre c√≥mo desarrollar y promover el √°rea como un mercado abierto para la industria cinematogr√°fica. La oficina realiza planes estrat√©gicos para competir con mercados como Nueva York, Los Angeles y Africa del Sur.

Para atraer m√°s producciones cinematogr√°ficas se crearon varias ventajas de impuestos, entre estos, la exenci√≥n de pago de algunos impuestos corporativos, a la propiedad y de inventarios. Tambi√©n se les exime de pagar impuestos en productos de la Florida que sean exportados y no pagan impuestos por la luz utilizada en la producci√≥n. 

En Miami Beach se les ofrece acceso gratis a la playa a un autom√≥vil de la producci√≥n y pago de medio precio durante los meses de junio a octubre, estacionamiento sin costo en el Centro de Convenciones mientras este no lo utiliza por residentes o convenciones y se puede tener acceso a los estacionamientos de paga sin cancelar constantemente (pagan una cuota mensual de 50 d√≥lares).

As√≠, la estrategia publicitaria enfatiza el clima favorable para las grabaciones, la cercan√≠a del Aeropuerto Internacional de Miami y una fuerza laboral capacitada en la industria.

Una vez el productor identifica el lugar donde quiere filmar, comienza el proceso de solicitud. 

"Todos los solicitantes tienen que tener un seguro y un acuerdo de indemnizaci√≥n entre ellos y la ciudad, sin esas dos cosas no pueden grabar nada", explica Bailey Figler, asistente de eventos de la Oficina de Artes, Cultura y Entretenimiento de Miami Beach.  

Los requisitos var√≠an de proyecto a proyecto, por ejemplo, para una pel√≠cula el permiso tiene que entregarse como m√≠nimo cuatro d√≠as antes de comenzar la producci√≥n. Si es una sesi√≥n fotogr√°fica debe ser entregada a no m√°s tardar un d√≠a antes de la sesi√≥n y no puede durar m√°s de tres semanas. Todas las solicitudes se eval√∫an por orden de llegada y el proceso puede llenarse por Internet, libre de costo.

El uso de los servicios de la ciudad por estas producciones se encuentra reglamentado y bien detallado. Si la producci√≥n necesita realizar la toma de un autom√≥vil en la playa tiene que obtener un permiso de acceso a la playa a un costo diario de 150 d√≥lares por autom√≥vil. En el caso de que se necesite cerrar una calle, el realizador tiene que conseguir un permiso firmado por el alcalde y el jefe de la polic√≠a y contar con la supervisi√≥n de un polic√≠a fuera de servicio. En cuanto al acceso de aceras, se tiene que solicitar una semana antes del comienzo del rodaje y notificar a las partes involucradas para no afectar el comercio. 

Cuando el √°rea seleccionada por el realizador es una residencial, las labores tienen que hacerse entre las 7 a.m. y las 10 p.m. durante los fines de semana. De ser necesario grabar fuera de este horario, el 60 por ciento de los residentes del √°rea afectada tiene que aprobar por escrito el permiso. El porcentaje incrementa a 75 cuando la filmaci√≥n es entre la una y las 7 a.m. 

En el caso de que tenga que durar m√°s de dos semanas, el 90 por ciento de los residentes tiene que estar de acuerdo.  El espacio de estacionamiento para los residentes tiene prioridad, por lo que no puede ser invadido por veh√≠culos del reparto. S√≥lo puede ponerse el equipo necesario mientras se graba la toma en estas zonas.

El aspecto m√°s controversial sobre las filmaciones son las interrupciones del tr√°nsito, tal como ocurri√≥ en agosto pasado con Bad Boys II, cuando el permiso otorgado por la polic√≠a para cerrar el elevado MacArthur por segunda vez les fue cancelado por coincidir con el inicio escolar. La cancelaci√≥n de ese d√≠a en espec√≠fico se debi√≥ al malestar de los ciudadanos, aunque Figler asegur√≥ que esta fue una situaci√≥n especial pero que siempre se negocia para lograr satisfacer a todas las partes del problema ya que "eso es lo que hace la oficina, un balance entre las necesidades de la ciudad, los residentes y los comerciantes".

La industria hotelera es la m√°s beneficiada ya que estas producciones necesitan alojamiento, comida y alquiler de carpas y autom√≥viles. 

"Cualquier cosa que venga a traer m√°s dinero es bueno", opina Cecilia Mart√≠nez, residente del √°rea. Las ganancias var√≠an seg√∫n el flujo de producciones, un mes puede ser de un mill√≥n de d√≥lares como el pr√≥ximo de 6 millones. La √©poca en la que se solicitan m√°s permisos de grabaci√≥n son los meses de octubre a mayo.

Recientemente se estuvo filmando en Miami Beach y otras partes del condado la pel√≠cula The Fast and the Furious II. Contrario a la imagen mental de que toda la industria gira en torno a la pantalla gigante, Figler dice que "s√≥lo tenemos una o dos pel√≠culas al a√±o, lo dem√°s son videos musicales, comerciales televisivos y sesiones fotogr√°ficas para revistas de modas."

Durante la √∫ltima semana de noviembre en el √°rea de Miami se estar√°n grabando cinco producciones, entre estas la segunda secuela de Bad Boys, Thundering Falls-The Film, el especial de HBO Baseball Wives y las telenovelas Los Teens y Ocean Drive. Los escenarios m√°s solicitados son Lincoln Road, Ocean Drive y otros lugares alrededor de la costa.

Headline: Elements intact for 2003 softball team
Subheadline: Team looks to build on success in 2002
Author: Steve Perhla
&nbsp;
The 2003 FIU softball team started its season Friday with a new look.
After struggling to score runs last season, the Golden Panthers will rely on a new, improved offensive unit in 2003.

"I think we led the conference in runners left on base last year," said head coach Kim Gwydir. "We just didn't knock people in. But this year the middle of the order is much better. This year I could switch my third batter to eighth, and eighth to third. That's the big difference. This year run production will be much better," she added.

After losing seven seniors from last year's 39-34 team, FIU will depend on some key underclassmen to lead the team.

Sophomore Amanda Nealer, a second team All-Sun Belt Conference pitcher last season with a 12-6 record and 1.09 ERA, is one of two aces on the FIU pitching staff.

The other is junior Kendra Laminack who posted an 8-8 mark with a 1.72 ERA.

Both will be relied upon heavily on the mound and should give opposing teams some problems due to their different styles of pitching.

Nealer, a southpaw, whose style Coach Gwydir compares to Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks, is known for her strength on overpowering opposing hitters. After playing with some minor injuries last year, Nealer looks to be in great shape for the current season.

"Last year Amanda was a little banged up. But she has done a lot of conditioning and she'll be great this year. She's gotten a lot stronger and healthier. That should complement her power game," said Gwydir.

On the other hand, Laminack resembles Greg Maddux of the Atlanta Braves, according to her coach. 

"Kendra is a finesse pitcher. She uses all speeds and different locations. She dissects the plate. She had some key wins last year, especially against Iowa (a 2-0 FIU win)."

"I'm not one of the fastest pitchers, but I do throw a really good curve ball. I throw my curve ball probably 60 percent of the time," Laminack said.

As for the offense, FIU will need consistent production out of junior third baseman and two-sport star Jennifer Owens, who is also a member of the volleyball team. 

Owens, who batted .263 with a team-high 33 RBI, will have to build upon her success from last year's performance, which also landed her on the All-Sun Belt Conference second team.

"The key for me is to stay consistent. But as a team, we need to put everything together," said Owens.

"She's probably the best athlete I've ever coached. She would be an 
All-American if she focused on one sport," said Gwydir.

Adding more experience to the middle of the lineup is starting catcher Marleah Stapf (.205, 11 BB, 7 RBI), who should see a significant increase in playing time.

"She literally hits the ball the farthest of anyone on the team," said Gwydir.

Freshman Jennifer Powell is one newcomer expected to make an immediate impact at first base.

"She's been a real pleasant surprise, and she has a cannon for an arm," said Gwydir.

The middle of the field is patrolled by two of FIU's fastest base runners, seniors Stephanie Wolter at shortstop and Nicole Dubovik in center field, both of whom finished in the top 2 in stolen bases for the Golden Panthers last year. 

Wolter, who bats leadoff, finished 2002 with 14 stolen bases, 18 walks, and 8 doubles, helping to generate a .301 on-base percentage. She was also named to the All-Sun Belt Conference second team.
Dubovik, who bats second in the order, stole 30 bases and hit .298 with a .344 on-base percentage.

Cynthia Turek, a junior transfer from South Florida, will start at second base, should also help FIU's run-scoring woes from a year ago.
Senior left fielder Meagan Dontrich (10 stolen bases, 19 runs scored) and junior right field transfer Amber Gill (East Carolina) complete the starting outfield.

FIU's designated hitter is junior Kristen Perry (.284, 2 HR, 20 RBI), who will also likely see some time at catcher. Perry was another Golden Panther named to the All-Sun Belt Conference second team in 2002.
As for pitching, after losing half of last year's staff, Coach Gwydir is looking for some new faces to step up and contribute to Nealer and Laminack's efforts. This includes freshman Nicole Barrett, Owens, and Turek, the latter two whom will move away from their natural positions when called to the mound.

However, FIU's strength seems to be its versatility. "Everybody can play a different position if needed," said Gwydir.

Depth should not be a problem either, with a talented bench that includes senior outfielder Rossana Lopez, junior second baseman Carmen Lopez, sophomores Yarah Otero (OF) and Lindsay Tippings (IF) and freshman Heather Taylor (1B/P). 

"We have a lot more depth, which is going to be a big key. We're young, but if we step it up, we'll be fine. We just need to get a few games under our belt, so we can develop some chemistry," Wolter said.
Already a strong pitching, running, and fielding team, FIU will need strong hitting in order to be successful against a dynamic schedule that includes defending national champion California, as well as Women's College World Series participants Arizona and UCLA. However, getting past rival Louisiana-Lafayette and winning the conference is the first step.

"We're going to beat them this year," said Nealer."But we would love to have our students there, that game especially."
Added Owens, "I look forward to all the conference games, but especially Louisiana-Lafayette."

"We have all the pieces of the puzzle this year, but we have to put it together. We have to play to our potential and we'll be fine," Wolter said.

Attention class warfare liberals:

You show both your bigotry and stupidity when you make a general claim that simply is not true in any fashion. Conservatism neither has in its doctrine, nor has in its application, the desire to oppress any IMPOVERISHED person--or any persons at all. What you are illustrating is your frustration with liberalism that it has failed to deliever success, drive, or wealth/capital (this includes all aspects of human capital and not limited to monetary wealth) in any individual. In order to be a liberal you have to be a pessimist. You have to believe you are inherently wronged in some way, shape, or form---and may have been wronged even before birth. It is also your belief that the federal government should control every aspect of a person's life--and that no one can succeed in life on their own. Liberalism has a record of failure in building independence and human capital. Instead it is blame and make someone else responsible. For years you liberals have failed to build a convincing case that Conservatism prevents the poor from succeeding. First of all success in not purely measured by money. Secondly, it is Conservatism that inspired welfare-to-work and the improvement in schools--instead of the soft bigotry of low expectations and no accountability. You have a record of failure. 

Another case must be made--you liberals have many rich fat cats among you. I can name many--I will name one: BS (Barbra Streisand).

Headline: De Carlo looks to build on success
Author: Daniel Izquierdo
&nbsp;
The old adage, "The grass is always greener on the other side," applies to many-if not most Americans and people all over the world-with the exception of Derek DeCarlo. The lanky sophomore right-hander is yet to lose on a college career that has spanned just over a calendar year now. Figuring the above statement to be true, you can stand on your side, with Derek standing on the other side adjacent to you and the fence between the two of you-perfectly conformed with where he is at this point in his career.

The other side might be greener by definition, but it is uncharted territory for DeCarlo, who flirted with that line and almost crossed over it, Friday night in his second start of the young season. Preceding his long third inning was a five-pitch masterpiece in which one hitter fanned on two straight off-speed offerings from DeCarlo's slender right arm. "I feel as if I haven't been able to get it all together so far this season," said DeCarlo, who benefited from solid run support last season, and the theme is a recurring one thus far. "It hasn't been a lack of mental preparation or focus, it's just that things aren't going to always go your way in this game."

One run scored after an Eastern Michigan base hit, but the run would have scored eventually after Ryan Arnett's towering home run that sailed over the 325 foot mark in right field. 

However, an extremely composed DeCarlo, went right after the next two hitters, getting both to go down on strikes. 

"Derek is the type of guy that will act the same whether he wins or loses," said sophomore Dennis Diaz. "That is the kind of player you want on your team. We usually bust his chops about how skinny he is because he doesn't like to work out a lot. However, when it comes to getting better as a pitcher, no one works harder."The righty, who tops out around 93 mph--while having tremendous control of a curveball and changeup that he uses to compliment his fastball-- finished the 2002 campaign with an 11-0 record and an ERA of 3.53. DeCarlo, who received a no decision last Friday against Florida A&M, handed the game over to the Golden Panthers' bullpen after allowing 4 runs in four and two-thirds innings. The Panthers came away victorious 13-5 - having received 13 runs of support in each of his first two starts.

As bad as the feeling in Derek's stomach might have been in the third inning, it wouldn't even come close to the lurking sense of helplessness that accompanied DeCarlo at the conclusion of last season during the team's trip to Gainesville for the NCAA Regional. Derek sat and watched as everything that could have gone wrong did."It really feels awful because you want to do anything you can to help the team win," said the sophomore who was shut down die to suffering soreness late in the year. 

"I have done some things as far as conditioning and strengthening my arm go, to prevent such a thing from happening this year."

As a result of his emergence within the staff, conference, and country, DeCarlo received numerous accolades, which included Sun Belt Conference Freshman of the Year, and All South Central Region as voted on by the American Baseball Coaches Association. 

The 6'3", 170 pound sophomore, accumulated enough victories to rewrite the history books at FIU--most in succession by a freshman in the program's 30 years.

Headline: Baseball remains undefeated with three wins
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
FIU swept Eastern Michigan this weekend. With these victories, it has extened its undefeated record to 5-0. 

 FIU 4, East. Michigan 3

The Golden Panthers began to raise the scoreboard in the third. With one out, sophomore infielder Dennis Diaz walked, later stole second base, and  was taken home with Summerell's single. FIU increased its advantage by two runs in the fourth inning as  junior outfielder Ricardo Nanita advanced home from third.

Eastern Michigan scored a run in the fifth due to a sacrifice bunt, which allowed Ryan Goleski to score.The Eagles succeeded in  tieing at the ninth inning as outfielder Ryan Arnett hit a  home run for East Michigan.
In the bottom half of the ninth inning and with two outs, Diaz  walked, and Summerell knocked home Rivera, winning the game for FIU. 

FIU 5, East. Michigan 2

Despite giving up a two-run lead in the eighth, FIU pulled out a 5-2 win over Eastern Michigan Saturday afternoon. Freshman outfielder Brian Aragon scored the winning run, reaching home on a wild pitch, and senior lefthander Derek Taylor recorded his second win of the season as FIU improved to 4-0 for the season.

The Golden Panthers built an early lead thanks to a lead-off home run from Summerell. He ended up 2-for-4 with an RBI and two runs scored. 
FIU built its second run in the third inning. Summerell doubled to right center. Freshman infielder Bryan Pullin then doubled to left center, advancing Summerell to third. After Aragon walked and junior outfielder Fernando Alvarez struck out swinging, Summerell reached home on a wild pitch.

Eastern Michigan tied the game in the top of the eighth on a two-run homerun from Hrovat. 

Senior infielder Skip Adams finished the scoring with a two-run jack to give the Golden Panthers a three-run lead. 

Junior righthander Josh Banks pitched his second-straight no-decision, leaving the game after the seventh inning with a no-hitter and eleven strikeouts. The seven innings pitched and eleven strikeouts tied personal bests, established last Saturday against Florida A&M.

FIU 13, East. Michigan 5

FIU defeated Eastern Michigan on the strength of a wild seventh inning, and held on to win 13-5 Friday night. The Golden Panthers scored nine runs in the bottom of the seventh, blowing open what had been a 4-3 deficit.

The rally was keyed by senior outfielder Solomon Frieder's single to right field to lead off the inning. Junior outfielder Ricardo Nanita advanced Frieder when he grounded out to third, sophomore catcher Adrian Casanova walked and junior outfielder Alvarez advanced both Frieder and Casanova when he grounded out to first.

With two outs in the bottom of the seventh, the Golden Panthers recorded eight hits and a walk to blow the game open with nine runs. Adams hit a 2 RBI single to start the scoring and Pullin followed it up with a single of his own. Pullin and Adams advanced due to a wild pitch and infielder Diaz tripled to bring them both home. After a pitching change, Summerell got an RBI single,  Rivera singled to bring freshman pinch runner Yahmed Yema to second and Frieder singled to center, scoring Yema. After another pitching change, Nanita drew a walk and Casanova doubled to left center, scoring all three runners. Alvarez flied out to end the inning.Sophomore righthander Derek DeCarlo got the start, and earned his second straight no-decision with 4.2 innings pitched, six hits allowed, and six strikeouts. Freshman Frank Gonzalez struck out two and allowing no runs.

Headline: Iraq: The Essential Part of the War on Terrorism.
Subheadline:  
Author: thedrdrew@netzero.com
&nbsp;
Here is where again I fear that what I write will not be printed. I certainly hope it meets the deadline and gets printed in the next issue. I already posted this to your website. Here it is again:


I would like to start by thanking President George Walker Bush for looking out for our future and the future of generations to follow with his bravery and leadership on the War on Terrorism. It is this very reason that there is opposition to this ensuing war on Iraq. The opposition against the war on Iraq is purely for political reasons. I will outline some key highlights. First of all, the protest ralley that was put on by ANSWR and the Nazi/Worker's World party illustrated all of the racism and bigotry of the remaining liberals and the liberals-in-hiding of the Democratic party. The protest ralley had Democratic presidential candidates like Revered Al "the Bigot" Sharpton. I was watching to see if they would present any rational argument against this war, but as usual it was all emotion and an all-out attack. It was an attack on Bush and the Bush family--claiming oil interests.
 
The political/liberal argument is represented in other ways--and represented by nations with short-term memories. Lets look at two nations: Germany and France. The French are a bunch of weasles and panzies. That will never change. They have an anti-American agenda. They hate America and everything it stands for anyway. Both Germany and France obviously did not learn the lesson that Adolf Hitler--another cruel dictator--taught them. It was America who liberated them through a regime change--and it was America who helped nation build these countries. And how do they repay us? By rewarding Saddam Hussein. First of all, France's reservation is for obvious reasons. They have an oil agreement with Adolf Hussein--which by the way undermined sanctions. We won't forget this when we go into Iraq next week or the following week and liberate this nation the same way we liberated France and Germany.  
 
But what must be explored is the INTENT here. Do Germany and France make a good case? They claim that war is not an option. But did they forget how nazism was destroyed? Historically, freedom was not obtained without spillage of blood. It is called PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. America liberated itself from being a colony of the British and started a democracy--by defeating the British. We did not simply say "Stop it or else we will write 12 declarations." The same people who oppose this war would have opposed war against the British. Why? They are weasles and panzies. They are not brave at all. But you can be certain that these liberal weasles are loving every minute of the freedoms they have today.   
 
This brings us to a final important point. The war on terrorism will be won by Conservatism and not liberalism/socialism. By fighting for our freedom instead of talking about freedom through resolutions we will win this war. If we adopt France's and Germany's amnesia democracy itself--what America has fought for--will be dead forever.

Headline: NASA undermines shuttle safety
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
While investigators center their efforts on the "Achilles heel" of the shuttle, a landing gear door which housed vital wiring and sensors which may have been impacted by the foam debris that was shed by the shuttle's main fuel tank, many other concerns about NASA's shuttle program have come to light.

And judging by some of these issues, there is reason to be concerned.

As early as 1995, there were complaints about how budget cuts and management changes were affecting the shuttle program. 

Jose Garcia, a shuttle manager who worked more than 30 years at Kennedy Space Center, expressed his concern in a letter to former President Bill Clinton.

He complained about changes being made to the shuttle turn-around process. Previously, NASA had employed two engineering teams to maintain the shuttle: one contracted, the other an in-house government-employed crew. 

The two, according to Garcia, had formed a system of "checks and balances" that he claimed were critical to the shuttle's safety and "the single most important factor that [set] the shuttle's success above that of any other [space] vehicle." 

NASA cut this system. They viewed it as a duplication of efforts and instead left the process of shuttle turn-around completely in the hands of private contractors, with NASA acting only as an auditor.

He cited these and other changes as "the biggest shuttle safety concern since the Challenger accident."

And Garcia was not alone in those concerns.

According to the New York Times, the nine-member Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel  expressed concern, before the Columbia incident, about shuttle safety.

"I have never been as worried for space shuttle safety as I am right now," Ph.D Richard D. Blomberg, one of the members, said. "All of my instincts suggest that the current approach is planting the seeds for future danger."

Five of those members were removed by NASA, which claimed that those members were merely cycled out to introduce fresher members more in touch with current technology. Ph.D John G. Stewart, one of the removed panelists, disagreed. "It's unusual to terminate people from a high-level group like that in midterm. We all thought it was ill advised," he said.

There is something very wrong within NASA's shuttle program. 

Budget cuts have left an aging fleet in questionable hands, and the end result might already be, though it is too early to tell, tragic.

It may be that none of this has anything to do with the Columbia. It could be that the loss of the Columbia was the result of some freakish accident. 

But where there's smoke, there's fire.

Who's to say that the foam that fell from the external tank might not have been a maintenance issue? 

A previous flight had also been damaged, though superficially, by falling debris from an external fuel tank. 

The Bush administration is in the process of proposing a $470 million budget increase for NASA, an increase they say had been planned before the Columbia broke up in the skies above Bush's home state of Texas. 

And in a way that seems somehow, though in a macabre sort of way, fitting; that a shuttle program's problems resulting from cuts made in Washington would come home to roost in the president's hometown.

Student Government Association:  Convincing 75 busy students to go to Tallahassee and handing out 2,000 petititions is no small task. In taking this proactive stance toward protecting Bright Futures scholarships, you have lived up to your responsibility to the student body.

LOSER

President George W. Bush: In the State of the Union address you said that "we will protect our homeland." Looking at your budget projections, it's hard to believe. A 10 percent per agency budget increase, despite additional expenses as agencies struggle to intergrate into the Office of Homeland Security? Are you kidding?

Headline: Title IX ensures fairness
Author: Amy Isaacs/ Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
WASHINGTON - When Hawaii congresswoman and former ADA President Patsy T. Mink died, millions of American women who play college, high school and professional sports - as well as many women who may never know her name - lost a champion.

Just three months before her death, the 30th anniversary of the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendments was celebrated.

Title IX is the federal law that prohibits discrimination based on gender at educational institutions receiving federal funds.

For Mink, dedication to these issues was borne out of her own bitter experience. Denied entry into medical school because she was a woman, she entered law school. 

It was those memories that drove her. Her original target was educational opportunity, and the rising number of women now in medical, law and other graduate schools are a tribute to her vision. It is in the field of college athletics, however, where Title IX has had the greatest impact and generated the most controversy.

Since 1971, girls' participation in high school sports has risen from approximately 300,000 to 2.8 million today. The United States now has professional women basketball players and has a World Cup Champion soccer team. 

Women's athletics have become a rich part of our landscape - none of which would have happened without Title IX. In addition, studies have shown that participation in sports can help young women to get better grades, gain confidence and lead a healthier life style.

Critics of Title IX point to the dissolution of men's sports teams at universities forced to fund women's sports. They fail to note that the problem is often a result of economic decisions made by university administrators more concerned about big-ticket sports such as men's football and basketball than in providing equal opportunities. Disparities still exist. Men's sports programs provide $146-million more than women's programs in college athletic scholarship money and 84 percent of the athletic directors remain men.

Yet, despite its obvious benefit and continuing need, Title IX is firmly in the sights of the Bush administration and others in Congress.

And, how shameful it will be if federal funds once again become the source of discrimination against more than half of our nation's population. Women deserve better and our nation deserves far more from its political leaders

Headline: Letters to the Editor: 'Panther Pride' Save Paper signs inaccurate
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

I must admit some confusion over the restroom signs near the sinks that use "Panther Pride" to advocate saving a tree by using less paper. 

This indicates a poor understanding of the nature of renewable resources and economics. 

I do not see signs advising students to eat less bread to save the wheat or buy fewer clothes to save the cotton. 

Paper is not made from trees from tropical rain forests but from cheap southern pines which have been grown on tree farms for that purpose for over a century. 

This is one reason we now have more trees in America than there were in 1900.

More to the point, if we stop buying new paper products, the tree farmers will stop growing trees.

Instead, they will use the land instead for something that will make a profit for them, such as a mall, a parking lot, or a housing development. 

Further, recycling paper creates an inferior and more expensive product and produces sludge every bit as toxic as that produced by new paper manufacture. 

If you want more apples, buy more apples and encourage the apple growers to supply a growing demand. If you want more trees, buy more new paper.

I am thankful, however, that those "Panther Pride" signs are not inside the stalls.

Headline: In Our View: Students need to back up words with action
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It works when people come together for one common cause. The FIU community proved this over the past few weeks when it expressed outrage over the university's recent handling of the men's soccer program.

Students, faculty, administrators and alumni joined to show the university that it wanted a men's soccer program at FIU. The school responded and is trying to find ways to allow the program too survive.

The outrage surrounded a roller coaster week in which FIU's athletic program dropped the men's soccer program due to financial considerations, only to reverse the decision a week later.

That original decision came on Jan. 16. One day later, after an all-day meeting with student-athletes and after a day of complaints from the community,  administrators announced that they would reconsider the termination of the program. Last Monday, Athletic Director Rick Mello announced that men's soccer would survive for at least two years and would work towards a long-term solution to the department's financial difficulties.

During its time in limbo, support came from a variety of places. FIU fans called and emailed the athletic department to express their anger and confusion. Area high school soccer coaches expressed disbelief. School personnel, including football head coach Don Strock, went to bat for the soccer program and encouraged the university to explore all available options before disbanding the team.

This support and community togetherness is too rare at FIU. The lesson that can be learned here is that community involvement does matter. But for it to matter long-term, the people who expressed the outrage at the decision need to back-up their words with action. Now.

Students need to be sitting in the stands next  season. Community enthusiasts need to find a way to help the team survive financially. And the team itself needs to lend its efforts to the fundraising that will be needed.

This has not happened with football, so far. Students said they wanted football, but failed to support the team with attendance for most of the season.

If soccer is to survive at FIU, this can't be the case.

The community has spoken. Now, will you act?

Headline: Bush's Union address contradictory
Author: Stephanie Leavitt/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
If any of you heard or read President George W. Bush's State of the Union Address last Tuesday, you probably noticed how much of a contradiction it was. 

He gave his list of priorities for the next year. The third one on his list mentioned "dramatically improving our environment." 

Yeah, sure he mentions a "comprehensive energy plan" but does he not realize that "our environment" includes the entire planet? Does dropping bombs and possibly starting a biological war count as a step to improving our environment? What about the unnecessary loss of lives he will cause if he declares war on Iraq. 

Sure he has his reasons but I think they are a bit flawed. 

He states that "in Iraq, we continue to see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror." 

Similar situations occur in countries all around the world. 

What about the Cubans who escape to America to flee their government, or the Venezuelan citizens that protest in the streets against their government? Why is there no mention of them? 

I guess he sees the fact that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction as a threat. 

However, I am sure that other countries also have weapons of mass destruction in their possession. The United States does for one. Does that give other countries the right to come and attack us? 

Don't get me wrong: I am all about defending our country. I realize that if I lived in almost any other country I would not have the opportunities that I have now. I just don't see a purpose for starting a war that will cause innocent people to die and the possible destruction of the world. 

Instead of concentrating his efforts on issues like this why doesn't he focus on education. 

The President talked about improving the economy and cutting taxes. 

He wants to give shareholders a tax break, but how many college students you know own stock in a company? We barely have enough to pay for tuition and books. 

President Bush spends so much money on things he calls priorities, but I guess education is not one of these. 

He proposes a $450-million initiative "to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners," and he has spent about $6 billion on his terrorism efforts. 

Why not spend less on those things and make more funds available to college students or improve the public school system so when students enter college they won't be at remedial levels? 

I don't know how many of you are on scholarships, but those of you who are know that scholarships in Florida were cut. 

Funds that were available during the summer semester in previous years were not available last year and probably won't be available this year. 

A good way of boosting the economy would be to increase money available to students and decrease the cost of tuition. 

Then students wouldn't have to take out as many loans and when they graduate their salaries could be used for purposes other than paying off student loans. 

 Maybe my view would be unrealistic to the president, but I think that if he is going to make an argument for something he should have better reasons for his actions, reasons that would benefit society and not contribute to its deterioration.

Headline: Social change a norm
Author: Jason Andreasen/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
In less than 60 years we have gone from Ozzie and Harriet having a quaint Sunday brunch to Ozzy and his bulldog relieving himself on a Persian rug. We have gone from Marilyn Monroe singing "Happy Birthday" to JFK to Marilyn Manson claiming that God is in the television. Transitions such as these recently prompted CNN to examine American culture and its alleged decline.

In the media, we oftentimes receive an oversimplified abrasive representation of the issues. The most blatant example of this can be seen in Bill O'Reilly's "No Spin Zone." In shows such as these, aging men often discuss how and why our contemporary society is one rap album away from Armageddon. 

The fact is, I would make a substantial wager that Bill O'Reilly wasn't exactly hanging out at the Monterrey Pop Festival or Woodstock. For that matter, he very likely might have maintained a 9:30 curfew on Friday nights.

It is not my intention to simply blast Bill O'Reilly (can't you tell I'm a big fan?) or the conservative press. However, it seems obvious to me that they would be, and are far more critical of any form of art or entertainment that is the least bit more abrasive than Celine Dion or "Touched by an Angel."

The debate over a a decline in our culture is one that dates back farther than the beloved family values of those who complain and perpetuate this senseless dispute. The question of cultural decline is the result of a generation gap rather than a real issue.

In the dawn of the rock 'n' roll era, when Elvis shook his hips on national television and Jerry Lee Lewis reached stardom via a crazy persona and a live show, parents and critics prophesied the demise of all that was good in the world. 

They talked about how the sexuality of those songs, which has really been inherent in music for centuries, would eventually lead children to become sexually promiscuous. 

In the heyday of the '60s and '70s, when acid rockers like Jefferson Airplane and David Bowie reigned and Jim Morrison defied Ed Sullivan and the censors by making an obvious reference to drug use, parents were worried. They were worried that society would begin to exist in its own drug-induced hippie stupor. 

More recently, the '90s saw critics claim that the music and movies would inevitably illicit all of the young people of the world to rise up in a Satanic fury. 

These days, it's Eminem and the Osbournes who are the central targets of conservative babble about the demise of our culture. The irony, as we all know, is that the more they are lambasted for their detrimental contributions to society, the more appealing they get.

Our culture is not declining, it's simply changing. To say that this change is negative is an incorrect value judgment. Every generation has its high points and its low points. While some might view the latest rap or shock-rock album as an indication of social damnation, this is a hasty generalization. A mere piece of bad art, as far as history has shown, has never caused an entire society to deteriorate with the rapidity that many major media outlets prophesy. 

Times change. Cultures change. However, what hasn't changed (and most likely never will) is the criticism caused by generation gaps. It's all one big cycle. 

One day, most of us will be parents who will criticize our children's music and tastes because they are different from our own. We should however be mature and intelligent enough to not reach the extremist conclusion that the end of the world is near because of it.

&nbsp;
Dan Arango was found dead in his Fontainebleau area apartment Saturday night, said Greek Affairs Coordinator Karen Katz. Arango, 22, died of apparent heart failure. Katz said Arango's roommates found the body and called police. 

As of press time, Miami-Dade police could not comment because Arango's final cause of death has yet to be determined. Arango was a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, lived off campus and was not enrolled in any classes this semester. 

Katz said members of the fraternity were notified and counselors were made available during a meeting that took place Sunday evening.

Sigma Alpha Mu President Edgar de la Calle knew Arango for four years. 

"He was a quiet, relaxed and an extremely smart guy," de la Calle said. "He was always very well informed on world issues." De la Calle said he was one of the first people to find out late Saturday night. He adds that he wasn't aware of any health-related problems in Arango's past. 

"We had just come back from a camping trip," de la Calle said. 

De la Calle said the fraternity will collect money to alleviate some of the financial burdens the family will face. 

Funeral arrangements had not been established as of last night. For more information call 305-348-2138.

Subheadline: Campus reacts to shuttle tragedy
Author: Hatzel Vela
&nbsp;
For Maria Castillo, the day started like any other. She got up at 8:30 a.m. and eventually turned on her television only to find something she said she could not believe. 

The NASA program was suffering from a tragedy.  The accident, which took place at approximately 9 a.m. placed the whole country in shock. At FIU, students were stunned and are still wondering what led to space shuttle Columbia's demise.

"It brought me back to 9-11," Castillo said. The finance major kept wondering what had gone wrong. "I didn't think it was terrorist-related."

Castillo's sister, Gioconda, agrees. 

Gioconda, 23, said terrorism was the last thing on her mind and that she felt sadness once she found out.

"I was in shock," Gioconda said, "after my cousin called and told me to turn on the television." 

Gioconda till remembers the tragic shuttle accident of 1986. 

"It's sad to see this happen in this day and age," Gioconda said.  She adds that even though there is always a risk by going into space, people always hope that everything goes well. 

She said technology should be more advanced 17 years after the 1986 incident. 

"As much as technology has improved, you would think this wouldn't happen," Gioconda said. 

Another student agrees with Gioconda.

"You wouldn't expect this after the Challenger," Rudy Bolton said. 

A 24-year-old accountant senior, Bolton, found out late Saturday afternoon. 

"I woke up late and once a family member told me what was going on, I began to watch [television] to see what was going on," Bolton said. 

Bolton said events like this are hard to forget, especially when you're young. 

"It's tough. It hit harder when I was young. I will always remmber."

The Castillo sisters watched Bush's address together and said they felt it was comforting and brought closure to that day's event. They agree with the president and say the NASA program should continue its missions into space.  

"This tragedy will hopefully improve the program so that something like this never happens again," Gioconda said. 

"The program should continue and this accident should not slow it down," Stanley Avignon said. The engineering major, who works at a car dealership, said he was at work when he first heard the news.

"I didn't think it was true when I heard the news on the radio," Avignon said. It was not until he spoke to his boss that he realized it was true. 

"It's kind of sad to see this happen at the end of a mission," Avignon said. 

Avignon said he also remembers the 1986 tragedy even though he was living in Haiti. 

As of press time, FIU had not planned any memorials to commemorate the lives of those lost.

Biscayne Bay

Agenda on hold until rally

WEDNESDAY - The uncertain future of Florida's Bright Futures Scholarship Program dominated this week's Student Government Association meeting.

Adrian Carter, Biscayne Bay Student Government Council president, set the tone by announcing that "everything we've been working on is on hold" until after Feb. 13 when SGA plans to be part of the public state university rally in Tallahassee.

"This is serious," said Carter, "this is the rubber meeting the road for student government." 

The concern is the program will become a need-based program instead of a merit-based program, as it is now. Carter said this program comes "the closest to being the purest program of just awarding straight" regardless of the students color. "You make the score, you make the grade, you get the scholarship," he said.

As discussed at the meeting, state universities are facing a funding shortage of approximately $111 million dollars or $10 million per university, based on state budget recently proposed by Gov. Jeb Bush. 

"That's $10 million, with an M," said Carter, "M, like M & M."
David L. Cole, Campus Life & Orientation associate director, advised SGC that they could have a direct impact on the state government and should carefully consider what they ask for.

"You have a governor who is particularly responsive to seeing large numbers of students walking around saying, 'we like something or we don't like something'," Cole said. "Be careful what you ask for, you may get it."

University Park

Fighting for Bright Futures

WEDNESDAY - Jessica Morffi, University Park Student Government Council president, began the meeting by asking students to get involved in the campaign to save the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program.

"The time to act is now. . . end of story. . . we must move or [the state] will take it away because they will think that we don't care," Morffi said.

Morffi is pushing along with many others from SGC and other organizations to keep the program. 

SGC handed out petitions to save Bright Futures. 2,000 petitions have been signed so far, according to Morffi. She said she was pleased with the growing support.

Seventy-five FIU students will be going to Tallahassee on Feb 13. for a rally to demonstrate how important the scholarship is to students.

The goal is to get 1000 students from the state of Florida - including 250 from Florida A & M University and 250 from Florida State University - to participate in the rally, according to Morffi.

The rally is being held in response to rumors about the state Board of Education's possible plan to make cuts to the Bright Futures Program. Approximately 7 cents out of every Florida Lottery ticket sold goes to the Bright Futures program.

More than 98,000 students received a Bright Futures scholarship for the 2001-2002 school year, according to the Department of Education.

Omar Castillo, University Park Student Government Council vice president, and Representative At-Large Clayton Solomon said they are in favor of keeping the scholarship.

SGC said they will continue to handout petitions, rally and lobby to try to save the Bright Futures Program.

Headline: See planets, stars from FIU
Author: ADRIANA OLIVA/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Can you imagine being able to see the planet Saturn from the University Park campus? The Physics Department is making that possible this semester with its free public astronomy programs and star parties.  

The programs and parties take place throughout the semester and are sponsored by Southern Cross Astronomical Society, the John Templeton Society and the American Scientific Affiliation. 

This semester's events feature two star parties and four lectures.

 "We do these events mostly as a public service to the community. Many people are scared of science," Associate Physics Professor James Webb said.

Webb is in charge of putting the event together and will be one of the speakers. 

The "Welcome Back Star Party," held Jan. 17, was this semester's kick-off event. Those who attended were able to observe stars and planets, while listening to music, with the help of FIU astronomers and a 12-inch telescope at the FIU observing pad.

"The sky was clear and the temperature was cold which allows for a good view. We were outside observing for about three and a half hours," Webb said. 

"Is the Universe Self-Caused or Caused by God," was the theme of the second event, which took place Friday. Dr. Quentin Smith, a philosopher at Western Michigan University, discussed five possible theories on how the universe was created. Among the theories were the Closed Causal Loop and the Big Bang-Big Crunch theories.

"I believe the universe is self-caused," Smith said while discussing his theories and others, including Albert Einstein's. He also explained the existence of black holes to an audience member.

"Smith's lecture was a bit unusual for us because [he] is a guest from a different university speaking on a philosophical level," Webb said.

Eighty-five people attended the event (according to Webb). 

"We usually get a big turnout for the lectures and talks, as well as for the star parties. Attendance ranges from 60 to over 100 people from all parts of Florida, as far as West Palm Beach and the Keys," Webb said. "Some of the people are even regulars." 

"As a high school student, I enjoy coming to these events because they are free and you get to be in a college setting listening and experiencing things you wouldn't normally get in a high school classroom," high school senior Marilyn Gonzalez said. 

The next event will take place Feb. 15. Webb will give a discourse on UFOs in the science community and how they are perceived by people because of media exposure.  In his lecture, he will attempt to correct some misconceptions people have about UFOs.

"Most scientists tend to divert away from speaking about UFOs," Webb said. "I'll be explaining the why they aren't talking much about it and what some of the real truths behind UFOs are."

Dr. Walter Van Hamme, an FIU astronomer, will lead the proceeding event on Feb. 28., "Astronomical Themes in Art." The Beacon was unable to contact Van Hamme regarding the details of his lecture.

Associate Physics Professor Caroline Simpson will be lecturing on some of the important women in the field of astronomy on March 28. "Women in Astronomy," is the second to last event, however, it is the final lecture. 

"Many women have played important roles in astronomy," Webb said.

"Among the many women I'll be speaking about are Caroline Hershel whose brother discovered the planet Uranus, as well as the Women of the Harvard Observatory, Annie Jump and Celia Payne-Gaposchkin, who till this day has written the best Ph. D. dissertation historically in astronomy since 1920," Simpson said. 

Simpson will also be discussing what it is like for a woman to work in a male-dominated field.

"About one-third of astronomers around the world are women," Simpson said.

The last event "Summer Star Party" will take place on April 11. There will be refreshments and another chance to observe stars and planets through telescopes.

"Hopefully the weather will be great, just like at the first star party," Webb said.

All the events are held in CP 145 at 8 p.m. They are free of charge and open to everyone.

Headline: Cyclist rides to Tallahassee for 'Gear Up Florida' charity
Author: Angela Castillo /Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Clayton Solomon, Student Government Association representative at large and Pi Kappa Phi member, will participate in "Gear up Florida," a cycling event for charity that will take place in mid-May. 

"Gear up Florida" is a smaller version of the "Journey of Hope" trek across America, which Solomon participated in last year. 

"Gear up Florida" participants will cycle from Miami Beach to the Capitol Building in Tallahassee. The entire trip will last 16 days and to qualify for participation, Solomon must raise over $1,500.

"What we will do is wake up at 5 or 6 a.m. and eat half of our breakfast quickly, jump on the road and ride 80 miles a day an average," Solomon said. "At night we'll visit local community homes for people with disabilities. . . They don't have visitors every day, so if they have 35 college men spending the day with them, it makes their day."

Solomon said "Gear Up Florida" is one of the most important national projects Push America has launched. 

Push America is a non-profit organization created by members of the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity. It intends to change the negative stereotype that surrounds fraternities by helping the disabled.

"I think ['Gear Up Florida'] is a great event for [Solomon] to help people who are not as fortunate as we are, and it's also great for him to do something that promotes a positive image of fraternities that is not always depicted by the media," Alex Madrigal, junior and Pi Kappa Phi member, said.

The purpose of "Gear Up Florida" is not only to raise funds, but also to raise awareness about disabilities. Along their trip, the cycling team will stop at local schools and perform a puppet show called "Kids on the Block."

"We are trying to teach kids that a person with disabilities is not different," Solomon said. "We want people to get more informed about disabilities, so they won't look at someone and have a negative stereotype just because they may take longer to do certain things.

"A person with a disability does almost anything we can do. They don't want people to feel sorry for them."

Solomon participated in the 64 day long "Journey of Hope"  last summer. It went from San Francisco to Washington D.C. 

"I noticed [Solomon] realized a lot about life when he came back from that trip," Aileen Grosz, Community & Internal Affairs director said. "Through the relationship he had with children with disabilities, he learned. . . to care about what really matters." 

"In the 'Journey of Hope' I realized that those kids go through something much harder than I had or would ever go through," Solomon said. "At the end of the day I get of the bike and my challenge was easy, but for those kids, their challenge is with them for the rest of their lives."

He encourages anyone who wants to contribute to Push America to contact him at Clayton.Solomon@fiu.edu, or at (305) 801-3665.

Headline: RHA runs medieval pageant
Author: ASRA JAWAID /Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Residence Hall Association held its third annual "Mr. and Ms. Housing" pageant Friday night in the residential quad in front of Panther Hall. 

The pageant was titled "A Medieval Affair." A makeshift stage was assembled and lights were placed around the quad to give the event the feel of a medieval pageant. 

All 250 seats were filled and spectators estimated that 50 or more latecomers watched from behind those seats. 

 Each of the four University Park residence halls - the University Park Towers, Everglades Hall, Panther Hall, and the University Park Apartments selected a male and female candidate for the event. Biscayne Bay Campus Bay Vista Housing also had two representatives. 

"All of the delegates were selected in pageants similar to Friday night's [that were] held last semester," said Monica Texidor, the Residence Hall Association's secretary and main organizer of the event.   

The evening began with a dance medley by the RHA dancers, after which hosts Magda Augustine and Darnell Mason introduced the contestants.   

After saying a few words about themselves, the contestants were brought out on stage again - this time to perform.

Ms. Panther Hall Jeanie Menendez sang a song she wrote and played the guitar.  

Marco Calderon, Mr. University Park Towers, prepared a crepe filled with chicken and broccoli for the judges onstage. 

"They went through the introduction, talent and questioning periods during the pageants for the individual halls last semester so tonight was a second time around for each of them," Texidor said. 

Some students attended the pageant out of curiosity. 

"I wanted to see the different representatives of the halls and what all the fuss was about," sophomore Jackie Nwaiwu said. 

The Everglades Hall Council was responsible for selecting the five judges. 

Among them included university employees from the residential life, campus life, and academic advising departments, as well as Jessica Morffi, UP Student Government Council president. 

"The judging was based on talent, stage presence, crowd appeal, appearance and individual response," Kadeon Thomas, Everglades Hall Council president, said. 

At the end of the evening, Ms. Bay Vista Patricia Valmyr and Calderon were announced the winners. They each received a crown. 

All contestants received a sash and gift bag with trinkets, said Kimberly Skiffington, Student Government Council housing representative. 

 This year's pageant was better and more successful, Texidor said.  "There was more council involvement and better decorations," she said. 

"I thought the contestants all did well. Everyone enjoyed themselves," Menendez said.

Who said rock music can't be fun? OK Go's latest, self-titled release is a sweet pop-rock candy cane. Twelve tracks of clean, tight and precise rock and roll, with a bright red swirl of fun.  You know those kinds of songs that get your foot tapping; the kind that just won't go away no matter how hard you try to get them out of your head?  

OK Go's new album is full of them. Normally, I'd frown on this, but OK Go does it with such impeccable style that it's hard not to enjoy.

Right off the bat, after the first two tracks or so, you know exactly what your listening to: pop-rock, that is, undeniably catchy rock music with uplifting and mostly driving beats, heart throb vocals and witty lyrics.  

What OK Go has done that is so special is to create music that contains all those elements that define pop-rock while maintaining a complex and unique song structure and composition. Listen to the fast paced "Don't Ask Me" for a sample of what I'm describing.

OK Go utilizes alternative instruments like organs, synthesizers and electronic drum-beat tracks to achieve their eclectic sound.  The complexity comes from the lovely harmonies and vocal choruses, especially in songs like "1000 Miles Per Hour,"  "There's a Fire" and "C-C-C Cinnamon Lips" which simultaneously soothe the ear, induce a relaxing smile on your face and throw your fingers into a bopping frenzy. 

 Simply stated, the album is just downright fun to listen to.  Because the music has such a cheerful and chipper personality, even the songs that are a little darker lyrically are arbitrarily happy anyway.

If there is anything unappealing about OK Go, it's a personal matter. For some, this ultra-happy way of rocking out might prove to be downright annoying.  

If your taste in music requires a darker, heavier sound, then don't say I didn't warn you.  This album, although awesome, is a bit on the cute side.

I admit that, at first, I didn't really think I would approve this album. The single "Get Over It," which you have probably heard on the radio or on "Madden 2003," didn't really catch my attention.  However, when I listened to it along with the other eleven songs on OK Go, it fits the scheme perfectly. 

What impresses me even more are the other musicians they've worked with and opened for, acts like Elliot Smith, The Promise Ring and They Might Be Giant's John Flansburgh. OK Go has been catching the attention of these and other pioneer musicians in the world of independent rock and are beginning to see a larger and more mature fan-base.

OK Go reminds me of bands like the pre-psychedelic Beatles, Weezer and a late, great ska band from California called The Hippos. They all share similar qualities in that they attempt, and basically succeed, in creating genuine music that is intricate and delicately complicated while at the same time easily likable.  

There's not one song on this album I couldn't imagine hearing on mainstream radio stations. Quite honestly, I wouldn't mind it either.

Headline: Childhood memories shouldn't be plundered for profits
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
That Murphy guy was an egocentric schmuck, wasn't he? He comes up with some witty axiom ("Whatever can go wrong, will") and then names the whole thing after himself: Murphy's Law. 

The joke was on him, of course. Now, whenever something goes wrong, you blame Murphy and his damn law. 

Same thing happened to poor Godwin. ("As a discussion online grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.") Now the guy is forever associated with Hitler and Nazis. That's what he gets for being narcissistic.

I'm not going to be that stupid. My axioms are going to be named after what they're talking about. Makes things easier for you, the reader. Plus, it means you won't associate me with parachute pants. Of course, soon you'll be thinking of me and seeing me in parachute pants, therefore, I hate you.

The Retro Rule: As a form of pop-culture is reaching a time frame age of 15-25 it will come into style again, under the ruse term of "retro."

Allow me to elaborate, because it really makes no sense in that fancy talk style. Basically, anything that's about 20 years old, give or take five years, becomes popular again. 

The reason for this is because people start reflecting on the past, the good days. And usually, about 20 years is a nice round number to reflect upon. 

You can easily do the math and figure out what life was like back then and be all like "yeah, those were the days."

The "Happy Days" Modifier: Eventually, a successful sitcom will be made about a decade approximately 20 years after it has come to pass.

Unfortunately for us, the 80s has yet to have its hit-com. The 70s had "Happy Days" and those blissful 50s. The 80s had "The Wonder Years," a dramedy representation of the 60s. The end of the 90s brought about the still running "That 70s Show." But despite the efforts of "That 80s Show" and "Freaks and Geeks," no one has been able to tap the right 80s-lovin' audience for hit ratings.

That's because they're aiming for the wrong demographics. Adults don't pine for the 80s. Most of them are ashamed of the entire decade. 

Instead, it is us, the college students of the new millenium, who remember the 80s so fondly. It was a great time to be a kid, when toys were trendy, video games were 8-bit and neon was a fashion statement only because it glowed in the dark. 

We weren't cokeheads watching "Miami Vice" and listening to Wang-Chung, we were nine-year olds hopped up on Lik-M-Aid, watching "Saved by the Bell" and listening to Paula Abdul only because she had that cool video where she danced with a cartoon cat.

But do the TV networks aim at satisfying our cravings for nostalgia? Nope. 

Rather than create a sitcom aimed for the 18-24 demographic (hello! we are the consumers you want), they continue pandering to old fogeys who could care less about that decade. In the meantime, our generation is getting childhood memories pillaged, sacked and violated with giant metal objects all in the name of the great American dollar.

I have no problem with the sales of old style Care Bear products in my local Hot Topic, but I do mind Claire's selling "Pound Puppy" dog tags for 11-year-old girls. 

For us, G.I. Joe had nothing to do with the real American Army, so why do we need them to be so politically correct? News-flash: Cobra Command will NOT sue Mattel for racial defamation.

And worst of all are the cartoons they've come out with, shoddy Korean animation rip-offs with hacken-eyed writing that sully the names of the cartoons we once held so dear. 

Remember "Transformers?" Sure you do. Who doesn't remember those giant robots that could turn into planes, tanks and trains? 

There were no humans on "Transformers," just radical robots that liked to fight in outer space. Now, whiny teenagers fight inside and alongside the transformers, making this new generation look like a cheap knock-off of "Power Rangers" on crack with a slight "Dragonball Z" fetish.

And don't get me started with the new "He-Man." He's one step away from being Freakazoid. One minute, he's a little putz even I could push down the stairs and then all of a sudden, he's a hulking mass of muscle in the middle of a desert. 

Since when was Prince Adam ganglier than me? I'll tell you when: Never!

But that's already said and done, with no respect toward the originals fans loved so much. 

What I'm really looking forward to is the new cartoon version of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Back in the day, I was a big TMNT fan, so the concept of "re-envisioning" is leaving me with mixed feelings. 

On the one hand, it's blasphemous to even consider redoing the Turtles. On the other hand, it could be the greatest new cartoon ever. 

How can you go wrong with ninjas who ate pizza and were mutant turtles that acted like teenagers? It's a concept that practically writes itself. 

My only concern is the fact that these new cartoons are going to be more faithful to the original comics. Having never cared for the comics, this concerns me.

Well, I suppose I'll find out if yet more of my childhood is getting raped this upcoming Saturday or if someone actually bothered to do something right with an 80s property. 

Meanwhile, can someone get to work on a sitcom about elementary and middle school during that decade? 

It's not difficult. When in doubt, make a joke about slap bracelets. It'll be huge.

Headline: Well-crafted Ignorance examines exile.
Author: Robert J. Gramatges
&nbsp;
What is home? Is it where one lives or where one was raised? Does your home lie with the people you love or where destiny takes you? Milan Kundera questions just that in his short, thought-provoking novel, "Ignorance." Like a fly on the wall, the narrator follows characters Irena and Josef back to Czechoslovakia in 1989 after a two-decade absence. Both emigrated after the Soviet take-over in 1969 and, upon their return, face the reality that life in Prague went on without them.                                                          

"Ignorance" forces the reader to evaluate life in the midst of political turmoil and exile. It juxtaposes the lives of Czech √©migr√©s with those who weathered the communist occupation of Czechoslovakia between 1969 and 1989. Irena faces extreme difficulty in connecting with her Czech friends when she returns to Prague in 1989. After twenty years of building a new home in France, she finds it hard to imagine that her return to Prague is a "Great Return" home. Her childhood friends have completely different lives and seem uninterested in Irena's experience away from Czechoslovakia. She is an outsider in a place she is supposed to consider home.

Josef moved to Denmark in 1969 and faced a similar struggle upon his return to his country of origin. He feels his family forgot he existed while he was away because many of his relatives had passed away without him receiving proper notice. Josef barely recognizes his own brother and finds it difficult to connect with his past. During his visit, he reunites with a communist friend and has an amazing discussion about the importance of the past and the definition of self. 

Josef and Irena cross paths on the flight back to their original home, leading to an inevitable climax: a vivid, page-turning sexual and emotional explosion between the pair. Intriguing supporting characters add substance to the work by giving the reader insight to the world in which the main characters live. As the story progresses, the lives of the characters fuse together to form a network of people all marvelously linked to one another by fate.

Kundera writes beautifully and from the heart, reaffirming his position among the elite of contemporary writers. He tells a story rich in history and tradition without being boringly technical; he adds believable emotional journeys to the history learned from textbooks. He dotes upon his characters with a parent's love and affection. His descriptions of the dreary situations never cease to convey genuine compassion and understanding for human suffering. 

Kundera's writing is a conversation with the reader told with eloquence and clarity. Like on the commentary track of a DVD, he discusses the actions of his characters every few chapters. The work is thought-provoking without going off into the philosophical rhetoric that often fills books of this nature. 

Words, art and historical data are intertwined with the journeys of the characters to add context. Kundera compares the journey of the √©migr√©s to Odysseus' journey in Homer's epic. He also uses the comments of Arnold Schoenberg, a 20th century musician, in an interesting philosophical analysis of time. Does our expectation of the future dictate our actions in the present? Does nostalgia overwhelm our thinking? Is it possible to live solely in the present? Milan Kundera's ideas on the subject are definitely worth reading.

Headline: "Darkness" falls short of expectations
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
Above all things, a good horror movie is required to find its own special way of scaring your pants off. So all things considered, "Darkness Falls" would technically be a good horror movie since it made me jump out of my seat a few times. I, for one, fail to see it that way. 

Our gruesome tale takes place in the small seaside town of Darkness Falls (doesn't it just scream vacation spot?). This is the first and silliest of this movie's many mistakes. Honestly, who in their right mind would name their town something as eerie and twisted as that? 

 One hundred and fifty years ago, Matilda Dixon was the sweetest old lady you'd ever meet. She was famous for giving money to children in exchange for their baby teeth, which inevitably earned her the title "The Tooth Fairy."

That all changed when a house fire horribly disfigured her. She spent the rest of her life hiding in the dark, coming out only at night and always wearing a porcelain mask. 

Naturally, she earned an entirely new reputation. When two boys go missing, guess who the townspeople point to? They accuse, seize and hang her (that's gratitude for you). 

According to legend, her vengeful spirit still haunts the town, going after children on the night they lose the last of their baby teeth, as well as anyone else who sees her face.

Twelve years ago, Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) lost the last of his baby teeth and was paid a visit by the tooth fairy. He managed to survive the encounter by staying in the light, but his mother, however, was brutally slaughtered. Since then, Kyle has kept out of the shadows. 

Flash-forward to the present. Nine-year-old Michael Greene (Lee Cromie) is afraid of the dark - so terrified that he has been confined to an institution screaming like a banshee every time the lights go out. 

His older sister Caitlin (Emma Caulfield from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") grows more concerned everyday and, like the doctors, starts to doubt if he'll ever get better. Desperate for help, she calls up her childhood friend Kyle who "coincidentally" seems to suffer from the same problem. 

So, he packs a bag of flashlights and heads back home, only to find a reception colder than a snowball. Of course, their lack of hospitality is the last thing he has to worry about, especially when the bodies start falling out of the sky.

To me, the experience of watching "Darkness Falls" is similar to a roller-coaster ride. There's a beginning, end and a large quantity of scary stuff in the middle. Unfortunately, trying to scare you is all this movie does. 

The storyline is unbelievably weak, resembling any number of ghost stories told  around the campfire by Boy Scouts. 

Also like a rollercoaster, it's over before you know it. There's not nearly enough time to tell a good story. 

Director Jonathan Liebesman is off to a bad start in showbusiness, especially considering this is only his second movie. 

 If all you're looking for is a few shocks then this is the movie for you. Personally, I prefer a good horror story, not one as lame, predictable and short on time as this. 

Eighty-five minutes of clich√©d scare tactics is all you'll get out of "Darkness Falls."

Headline: Unplugged winners to open for Ludacris
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
Gracie's Grill was the spot to be Thursday as students and curious by-passers crowded the room to see some hard-core competition at the FIU Unplugged concert. After 12 local music acts, a lot of sweat and serious talent, the Student Programming Council (SPC) was ready to count the votes and announce the three winners who will go on to open for the FIU Ludacris concert Sunday, Feb. 9.

The challenge began in November for Jen Dark, Crashing Tide, Move Da Crowd Productions, Native Tone, Far From, Caribbean Soul, Solis, Deuce, Lef Field, Serum, Seven Star and Songo Sounds Records Family. Thursday, however, was the last chance for the band to convince students and a seven-judge panel of SPC members that they had what it takes to be one of the opening acts for the dirty-South rap superstar. 

In the end, Move Da Crowd Productions, Songo Sounds Records Family and Crashing Tide's energetic performances proved worthy of the raw talent SPC was searching for.

The Move Da Crowd Productions crew stormed in ready to rock the house with hot hip-hop beats. The four-member act, which was later joined by additional crew members, rhymed to a diverse combination of beats including Nelly's "Air Force One." The group nailed the essential "hip-pop" show concept by featuring their own break dancer, whose fresh moves brought old-school flavor into the performance and, of course, girls with hats, stiletto boots and tight jeans to fill the background.  

Offering a different take on hip-hop, Songo Sounds Records Family set out to bring a more lyrical and less flashy performance, with the three MC's X-Caliba, CTraffik and Virsitile. The exceptional trio hyped up both the crowd and judges with their all-out performance as they jumped on chairs throughout the act. A.J. the DJ spinned a variety of hip-hop beats to reggae mixes that made Songo Sounds' sound fusion entirely unique when compared to the rest of the acts. 

X-Caliba's fast and upbeat lyrics, which might make Busta Rhymes tongue-tied, are a solid contrast to CTraffik's hilarious Spanglish rhymes. Their witty free styling only got better, reacting and rhyming about certain elements in the crowd such as a photographer.  This is not your typical hip-hop act, and their honest effort to represent Miami rap in their lyrics contributes to the freshness of their performance. 

Last, but not least, the quartet Crashing Tide rendered what many believed to be the best performance of the entire show. The hard rock band's charisma was simply electrifying, and Crashing Tide literally owned the audience.  The songs "Court Jester," "In Passing" and "Broad" took the crowd on a rollercoaster from slow, hypnotic vocals accompanied by strong bass, to fast, high-roaring, head-banging drum beats. 

The lead singer's soulfully deep vocals were contagious, and there was a romantic edge to his performance amidst all the heaviness of the music. 

Crashing Tide's lyrics range from the strange and the darkness that was heard in "Court Jester" to simple but beautiful phrases like "So breathe once more into her/ don't let this chance fall and slip away/ just breathe once more into her, before it ends," from the song "Broad." 

Other acts, although not selected, but worthy of recognition were Serum and Native Tone.  Serum's appealing politically-oriented and unconventional lyrics can only be labeled as the words of a musical poet. 

This M.C. was all about challenging commercial hip-hop, rapping about everything from Maya Angelou to the military draft. His song "Melting in the Pot" featured strong messages and the fast rhymes that made Serum stand out during the show. 

Native Tone, although thought to be one of the favorite performances, was not selected, but the four-member act played a sweet fusion of reggae/ska, resembling the sounds of bands like Sublime and 311, matched by humorous songs like "Ten-Cent Whore." 

The competition is over for Crashing Tide, Songo Sounds and Move Da Crowd Productions, but the hard work has only begun.  These three acts will face their final and most important challenge   Sunday at the Ludacris concert where they will perform for an undoubtedly huge audience and get the chance of a lifetime.
