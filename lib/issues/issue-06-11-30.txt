Headline: Shaq pledges he'll come back strong from surgery
Author: Steven Wine / AP Wire
&nbsp;
First, Shaq sat. To take a load off his surgically repaired left knee, he settled into a chair outside the Miami Heat locker room Tuesday.

Then he spoke barely above a whisper into a cluster of microphones inches from his face. For those straining to hear, the message was nonetheless clear: Shaquille O'Neal's latest injury shouldn't be interpreted as a sign that he's in decline.

"They've been saying that the last 10 years," said O'Neal, speaking publicly for the first time since his surgery Nov. 19. "I'm going to stick to my formula. I know what I've been doing, and nobody does it better, even at the tender age of 34."

O'Neal has been sidelined since Nov. 12, when he tore knee cartilage against Houston, and he's expected to be out until at least Dec. 23.

A year ago, when O'Neal sprained his ankle in Miami's home opener and missed 18 games, there was talk that his body was breaking down. He recovered, sat out only five more games and led the Heat to the NBA title for his fourth championship ring.

Now that he's in the midst of another layoff, rumblings about slippage in his productivity have resurfaced. He dismisses detractors.

"I don't say anything to people that could never do the stuff that I can do," he said.

Miami's sub-.500 record in O'Neal's absence suggests that his value remains high. The Heat went 10-13 without him a year ago, and they're 4-6 without him this month.

"My brothers are out there struggling right now, and I should be out there with them," he said. "It's very, very difficult to watch."

He's expected to remain on the bench for a while. The injury was originally diagnosed as a hyperextended knee, and O'Neal said he was surprised when an MRI exam revealed the need for surgery.

His layoff is projected to be four to six weeks following the operation, and O'Neal has yet to resume running.

"It's like starting over," he said. "A couple of days before I got the second diagnosis, I made the comment that my leg was dead. Usually when you have a knee injury, your quads and everything just shut down. That's what was happening. Now I just have to rebuild all that back up."

O'Neal has missed 185 games during his 15-year NBA career, but this is the first time he needed rehabilitation therapy following an operation.

"I hope his thought process is that he tries to almost reinvent himself physically," coach Pat Riley said. "He has to come back a lot lighter, a lot leaner. Those kinds of things are really important now."

No problem, O'Neal said.

"I'll be in shape good enough to help the team out and help win games and further what we're trying to do," he said.

Miami lost four consecutive home games, but Dwyane Wade's move to point guard last week revived the offense. Wade has totaled at least 30 points and 10 assists in three consecutive games, and the Shaq-less Heat have won two in a row.

"We just have to develop a certain style right now and develop some consistency," O'Neal said. "We're getting better and moving the ball better, and Dwyane is playing phenomenal. Everyone else just has to do more and step up. We all have to step up. And we will."

Headline: Men's basketball falls to 2006 Final Four team
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Despite a strong start to the game, a series of scoring droughts handicapped the Golden Panther men's basketball squad in their effort to upset 2006 final four participants to George Mason University on Monday.

Versatile junior Chris Fuller had a season high 13 points and five boards, but it wasn't nearly enough as the Golden Panthers fell 65-39 at the Patriot Center in Fairfax, Va.

The Golden Panthers took an early 7-6 lead off a three-pointer from sharp shooting sophomore guard Elvis Lora.

Unfortunately, it would prove to be Lora's only three-point hit for the game on just two attempts and it ignited the Patriots to respond with a resounding 9-0 run.

For the Patriots, it was their 6'5" senior guard Gabe Norwood who got things going with three consecutive buckets in the early run for them.

With the possibility of an early blowout already on the minds of the Patriots, Fuller began to become more aggressive on the offensive end and it paid off. After converting a lay-up, Fuller swished a jumper to pull the Golden Panthers within five at 17-12.

However, the Patriots had another run in store and this time it was an even more explosive one.

In just seven minutes the lead ballooned to 18, as sophomore point guard Dre Smith orchestrated his team's offense to the tune of 13 consecutive points.

At halftime, the Golden Panthers trailed 33-17, as they put up their second lowest point total in an opening half since being held to eleven against South Alabama way back in February.

In the second half, the Golden Panthers seem poised to get back in the game as they put up six consecutive points out of the gates.

Unfortunately for them, the first half trend would continue as the Patriots answered with a 12-0 run of their own to put the Golden Panthers in a deep 47-23 hole, one that would prove to be too deep to get out off.

The Golden Panthers had a good chance to pull off the upset as they were within striking distance for much of the game, but the Patriots just unleashed their offensive attack when it mattered most.

The Golden Panthers got little from their bench as they were outscored 41-19 in bench points.

Athletic junior guard Dejon Prejean continued to make his presence felt in his first season with the Golden Panthers as he contributed eight points and two boards in the losing effort. 

However, other than Fuller and Prejean, nobody else was even near the double digit mark.

Senior guard Johwen Villegas, who is the team's leading scorer, was held scoreless for the first time this season as he had a forgettable 0-5 night from the field in 23 minutes of action.

Sophomore forward Alex Galindo, who has been impressive early on in the season, was a woeful 1-9 from the field, as he finished with just four points and two rebounds, and senior forward Facundo Giorgi didn't even attempt a shot in just 14 minutes of action. 

Ironically, both Villegas and Galindo were coming off their arguably best performances of the season in their previous game, a 70-68 win at Kennesaw State. In that game, Villegas led all scorers with 23 points, and Galindo put up 14 second half points to propel the Golden Panthers to the slim win.

For the Patriots, it was Smith who did the bulk of the damage as he finished with a-career-high 20 points on 8-14 shooting.

 Darryl Munroe chipped in with nine points and a-game-high eight rebounds to help his team improve to 3-2 and pick up their first home win of the season.

 At 3-4, the Golden Panthers will look to get back to the .500 mark with a win at Wisconsin on Saturday before returning home to face junior talent EJ Murray and Florida Tech on Dec 5.

Headline: Team mimics coach's quitting attitude
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It hurts.

That's all that can be said after Florida Atlantic defeated FIU 31-0 at Dolphin Stadium in the fifth annual Shula Bowl.

Not the losses, resignation of coach Don Strock, hits by defenders or the pain felt the next morning. This hurts deeper than a bruise.

Quitting hurts the soul. That's what several FIU players said following the loss to the Owls, saying that many of the teammates quit on them.

"A lot of people didn't come out to play," said senior defensive end Antwan Barnes. "A couple of us came to play, but the majority ain't come to play. They're looking forward to next year."

The "they" Barnes is referring to are players who don't care about the rest of the season, mainly underclassmen.

He and several other players felt similar and final stats from the game don't lie. FAU controlled the ball 11:19 more than FIU and out-rushed them 142 to 50-yards in the game. The Owls dominated in every facet of the game. 

"It was just a sad moment watching [FAU] run and pick up the Shula Bowl trophy," Barnes said.

It's hard not to feel for the seniors on the team, especially those on the defensive side of the ball, who fought all season to keep them in the game despite the offense's shortcomings. What's more sad is seeing the look of disappointment in the eyes of senior linebacker Alexander Bostic III who is among one of the more upbeat and vocal players on the team.

"We worked so hard for this. I think people just don't care," Bostic said. "It's hard, man."

It's especially difficult when the Golden Panthers are missing their leading tackler, senior linebacker Keyonvis Bouie. Beside his ball-hawking instincts, Bouie is the emotional leader on the team and pulse for the 26-ranked defense in the country.

"He's the one that gets us up. You can't just take that away from us," Bostic said.

What is being taken away from the Golden Panthers is Strock, who isn't really being taken away but simply stepping away from his 0-11 team.

After a loss to Louisiana-Lafayette on homecoming, senior wide receiver Chandler Williams said that players who couldn't get motivated for the Shula Bowl should not even play football. Williams was surprised at the loss and manner in which it came in.

"I really can't tell you why," Williams said. "Obviously they wanted it more than us."

But Strock knows why his team lost.

"The same problems have harmed us at all year: protection at times, routes, missed tackles -same thing. Those are things that hurt," Strock said. "You have to have intensity when you play the game of football, but obviously we didn't have that."

One would guess that some of these problems would have been cleared up by now. 

Despite seeing what went wrong during the game, Strock didn't seem to see any of his players giving up.

"I didn't think they came out flat. There's a difference between coming out ready to play and somebody coming out who's really ready to play. [FAU] had something to prove and they did."

Strock's resignation on Nov. 15 proved something else - he's quitting on his team.

Last time I checked, quitting and resigning are the same thing.

His resignation is the best thing for the program, especially its players. What does it say when Athletic Director Pete Garcia does more yelling and screaming at players on the flight home after 35-0 loss to Alabama? Would Strock have done the same thing if Garcia was not on the plane?

I doubt it.

Strock has established a culture where mediocrity is accepted and almost the norm. It doesn't surprise me what effort, or lack thereof, was given during the loss to FAU. Though he may have been able to spot receivers running down the side line for touchdown passes, Strock doesn't seem to see the problem at hand with his team.

"I guess [players] are looking forward to playing next season," Barnes said.

And in their final game of the season against Troy, the task doesn't get much easier. Troy must win their final game against FIU to win the Sun Belt Conference and earn a trip to the New Orleans Bowl. Don't look for the Golden Panthers to mess up Troy's travel plans.

Some players have said they wanted to end the season on a positive note for Strock. How about this: instead of winning one for the ol' Gipper, how about winning one for the seniors who have played their hearts out the past four years?

Let them remember what it feels like to win again and go out a winner.

Headline: NOWHERE TO RUN: Football handed 11th straight loss of season
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After handling Florida Atlantic last season 52-6, the Golden Panthers thought that the Nov. 25 date at Dolphin Stadium in the annual Shula Bowl could be the night they got their first win of the season. 

Head coach Howard Schnellenberger and his Owls squad had other ideas.

FIU (0-11, 0-6) was dominated from start to finish in front of 9,655 fans as rival FAU (5-7, 4-3) finished their first Sun Belt season with a two-game winning streak by handing the Golden Panthers their third shutout loss of the season, 31-0.

"I told our team every day this week that FAU would come in here tonight ready to play and they must not have listened," said FIU head coach Don Strock. "FAU came in ready to play and we thought we came in ready to play, but there was a difference. That group came out and had something to prove"

Over the last five games dating back to the infamous Oct. 14 match-up with the University of Miami, Strock's team has been outscored 156-10, including three shutout losses.

The Golden Panthers' inability to move the ball on the ground once again proved to be their crutch as they managed just 50 yards rushing on the night. 

A'mod Ned led the FIU running game with 40 yards on 10 carries. Quarterback Josh Padrick was held under 100 yards passing for the first time this year, managing just 92 on 11 of 23 passing.

Red shirt freshman Rusty Smith led the Owls offense finishing the night 13 of 20 for 178 and two touchdowns and back-up tailback B.J. Manley led three FAU rushers who went over 40 yards with 53 on 10 carries. 

Right from the start, Smith showed what was in store for the Golden Panthers. The Owls rolled down the field on their opening drive as Smith connected with wide receiver Frantz Simeon on a 13-yard touchdown pass giving the home side an early 7-0 lead. 

It wouldn't take long for the FAU defense to show their superiority over FIU as they constantly stopped Strock's defense and, 52 seconds into the second quarter, used their offense to strike again.

This time, fullback Aaron Sanchez capped off an eight play, 76-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.

Backfield teammate and starting tailback Charles Pierre, a red shirt sophomore, put the game out of reach with 5:01 to play in the first half as he scampered untouched from four yards out to make it 21-0 heading into the break.

The Golden Panther defense really missed leading tackler Keyonvis Bouie - out with a sprained MCL - and couldn't stop the hosts as the rain started to fall in the second half.

Though the Golden Panthers did move the ball better in the second half offensively, the defense was unable to stop the Owls and place kicker Warley Leroy made it a 24-0 lead with 12:57 to play in the game with a 29-yard field goal.

B.J. Manley capped off the night for FAU with 6:28 to play on a two-yard touchdown run that capped off an eight play, 60-yard drive that put the score at 31-0.

"We played better in the second half and made some plays," Strock said, "but the same thing hurt us tonight that's been hurting us all season: protecting the quarterback, misrun routes, missed tackles - all the same things."

Antwan Barnes led the way on defense for FIU with 11 tackles, three and a half for a loss, and a sack. Freshman Michael Dominguez, stepping in for the injured Bouie, had nine tackles. Florida Atlantic racked up 361 yards of offense and went a perfect five-for-five in the red zone. They converted nine of 14 third downs compared to FIU's two of 10.

Time of possession was once again a deciding factor for the Golden Panthers as their defense was worn out, having to control the Owls for over 34 minutes. The Golden Panther offense managed to have the ball for just 22:41 and move the ball 203 yards. 

On a positive note, the Golden Panthers did not turn the ball over for the first time this season. However, they were shutout for the second time in three games. 

The Golden Panthers will close out their season against conference leaders Troy at FIU stadium Dec. 2 at 6 p.m. If Troy beats FIU, coming off their win over previously unbeaten Middle Tennessee Nov. 25, the Trojans would win the Sun Belt Conference and play in the New Orleans Bowl Dec. 22. A loss would hand the title to MTSU. 

FIU looks to leave Duke (0-12) as the only winless team in the country.

Headline: Lecture addresses terrorism sponsoring
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Terrorism is big business when it comes to funding, from e-mail scams, laundering money, fake companies, and an assortment of other mediums. This will be the topic of discussion of "The Complex Network of the Terror Money Trail," a lecture presented by financial analyst Jonathan Schanzer, who works in the U.S. Department of Treasury's  Office of Intelligence and Analysis.

The lecture will take place Dec. 3 at 3 p.m. at Biscayne Bay Campus as part of the Middle East Society's lectures.

"The ability of terror groups to carry out their operations and sustain their organizations is dependent on their ability to raise funds and move them world-wide," said Shlomi Dinar, associate professor and director of the MES. "Halting these terror groups before they are able to complete their missions and disabling their organizational apparatus relies on the ability to track and freeze their funds." 

Schanzer is the author of numerous scholarly pieces, newspaper editorials and political magazine articles on the subject of terrorism as well as author of the book Al-Qaida's Armies: Middle East Affiliate Groups and the Next Generation of Terror. 

In his lecture, he will discuss the increase in terrorism founding.

According to a report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as of December 2005, more than $471 million in assets associated with known state sponsored terrorists were located within U.S. jurisdiction. Of that total, $368.9 million had been blocked through sanctions while the remaining amount of $102.1 million represents assets of individuals and entities from Iran and Syria. 

The MES, a component of the department of international relations, hopes to raise awareness on a variety of issues concerning the Middle East through lectures and events.

"By bringing different speakers to campus, MES's ultimate goal is to help secure FIU's place as a center of debate and learning on matters concerning the Middle East," Dinar said.

The MES is a membership organization in its second year of operation. It is open to the general public at a cost of $35 to join. However, membership is free for degree seeking FIU students. 

"MES hopes to become a funding source for student scholarships and auxiliary programming related to the department of international relations," Dinar said. 

The MES will also hold several other events during the Spring semester to raise awareness on issues in the Middle East. The first one, a roundtable event called "Human Rights in the Middle East," will be held Jan. 28 and will count with the presence of several experts on the area. 

On Feb. 25, Michael Oreste, FIU's diplomat in residence, will give a lecture titled "On the Ground in Iraq," based on Oreste's diplomatic tour experiences in Northern Iraq.

On March 11, Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, will lecture on Iran's role in the Middle East.

Schanzer's lecture will be held Dec. 3 at 3 p.m. at BBC AC-1 194, and it's free and open to the public.

Headline: Preparations begin for AIDS Day
Author: Eddith Sevilla and Angelina Troff / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Though World AIDS Day is not until Dec. 1, FIU has already started promoting AIDS awareness for students.

With World AIDS Day right around the corner, University Park held two separate events, the Be HIV Educated Project and the Voicing Opinions and Cultural Equality Fashion Show Nov. 28, to educate students on the facts concerning AIDS.

B-HIVE, as the project is popularily called, offered students a chance to learn about the virus through speakers, skits and testimonials.

"The personal stories really made it real - it's not just people trying to scare you," said Aarti Chhantlani, a junior at FIU.

Although the testimonials were not given by students, Matthew Parisi, a senior and co-chair of B-HIVE, was grateful for those who did speak.

"It's tough to find people who want to speak. The Center for Positive Connections was kind enough to provide us with three of their regular clients and I felt that was a good option for us," Parisi said.

The Project also offered free HIV testing, with results available in 20 minutes.

Rachel Olmedo, a sophomore, found it a simple and non-threatening procedure.

"I got tested. It's the easiest thing you can do. It's just a swab in the mouth," said Olmedo.

Ileana Hernadez, a senior, attended because she felt it would further her career.

"I want to be a sex therapist, so this is good. I need to tell patients how important testing is," Hernandez said.

 Overall, Parisi found the event a success.

"One goal was to surpass the amount of money raised last year," he said.

Last year, B-HIVE raised just under $3,000 for the Children's Home Society. This year, Parisi and co-chair Tamara Marryshow presented the Center for Positive Connections with $4,000.

James Konschnik, the center's executive director, said that the center serves those who have been affected and infected with the virus.

Another goal was to have a good turnout at the event.

"As long as we provided education to one person who needed it and testing to one person who wanted it, it was a success," Parisi said.

Another student-run event, the V.O.I.C.E. Fashion Show, took place at 8 p.m. in the Graham Center Ballrooms, in which HIV facts were presented.

"We handed out palm cards with information on how HIV is transmitted and a 'mini-contract' promising to make safe sexual choices," said Casandra Roache, senior health educator and advisor for Students Health Advocates for Peer Education, program led by students to promote healthy activities including fitness, sex education and stress management, among others.

According to Roache, UP's Health and Services Wellness Center collaborates with Care Resources, an outside community-based organization to provide free HIV tests for students.

HIV tests are not limited to UP students only. Students at Biscayne Bay Campus can also take advantage of the free tests every Tuesday, according to Elvira Velez, director of health administration.

Although UP got a head start on AIDS awareness, AIDS presentations at BBC don't begin until Dec. 1 - the actual date of the commemoration.

Claudia Uribe, associate director of Reach 2012, an HIV primary prevention and research project funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a tabling event will take place Dec. 1 in the Wolfe University Center's Panther Square.

Educational pamphlets will be handed out to students as well as free condoms and information on how to use them correctly.

According to Uribe, Florida ranks third - after New York and California - in the highest number of AIDS cases in the nation.

Also according to Uribe, Miami-Dade county has the highest number of AIDS cases in South Florida.

Uribe along with other advocates of AIDS awareness at FIU are expecting students to get a better understanding of HIV and prevention methods.

"We're expecting an increase of awareness of young adults and the problems with HIV," Uribe said.

Care Resources provides free HIV tests every Monday and Friday at the UP Wellness Center from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and at the BBC Wellness Center every Tuesday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Students have to call the mainline for University Health Services at 305-348-2401 and make an appointment.

Headline: SPC president steps down from office
Author: Jose Pagliery / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Due to his own conflicting interests, Student Programming Council President Bill Buchanan stepped down Nov. 21, after completing a one-year term in which he bore witness to a number of structural changes that many say have improved the program.

"I didn't want the organization to suffer because of my inability to sacrifice time," Buchanan said. "I've been involved since I've been here but it's about time."

Buchanan, a senior who is double-majoring in both political science and religious studies, came to the decision while registering for Spring semester classes. He chose to step down that same day, considering it "a good time" for SPC; but program leaders were caught off guard.

"My biggest goal is to keep everything under control," said 	SPC Vice President Micaela Ancewicz, who is currently acting as president.

Ancewicz says she feels that the situation could go very smoothly. As Buchanan's decision has come late in the semester, SPC has much more time to restore the leadership.

"I needed time, I put all my life into FIU, and it's my turn to take time for myself. I mean, I graduated high school at the same time as my adviser," said Buchanan, who plans to attend law school.  

Under Buchanan's tenure, SPC saw a number of changes including the revision of the council's constitution and the restructuring of its organizational hierarchy.

SPC Treasurer Jaime Martinez remembers that only a year ago, the program wasn't in such great condition.

"SPC was down in the slums," Martinez said. "But he brought it up with his iron fist."

"The organization, as a whole, had no organization," Buchanan said, about his first impression of the program.

Buchanan, who studied at West Point for two years before transferring to FIU after sustaining injuries from an academy football game, seems to have brought some of his martial training with him.

SPC chairs recognized the need for a strong and dedicated leader, and therefore chose him as a candidate for the SPC presidency. At the time, Buchanan was not only the American Heritage Week chairperson and SPC representative to the Student Government Association, but was also president of Sigma Phi Epsilon.

"Creating a bridge between SGA and SPC is a major part of the president's job," Buchanan said.

During his time at the council, he soon discovered that there exists a difference between military direction and civilian management.

"My leadership style was very militaristic," said Buchanan. "SPC taught me how to be a civilian leader."

Surprisingly, what led him to become involved with SPC was far more congenial: the free food. That, along with the benefit for fellow students, pulled him into the council, where he decided to get students involved at a non-traditional university where "not a lot goes on," as he puts it.

Within a few months, his active involvement and militaristic guidance led SPC to become a functioning council once more.

"But I was just there. All the accomplishments have little to do with me; they have everything to do with my chairpersons," Buchanan said.

Hoping that the program continues to grow after his departure, Buchanan also optimistically expects an increase in the program's budget, being sure that it will only enhance SPC's contribution to campus life.

Although he has chosen to adjust his focus to his studies with hopes to graduate soon, Buchanan promises to continue to be a member of SPC, even after graduation. 

Buchanan defends his decision, supporting it with his belief that his effectiveness has run itself out.

"There's only so long that the same leader can make an impact," he said.

Headline: Three-day class schedule official
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
It's official: beginning Fall 2007, FIU will switch to a Monday/Wednesday/Friday class schedule, according to a Nov. 27 University-wide e-mail from Interim Provost Ronald Berkman.

Under the current class schedule, classes meet twice a week, either Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday, for 75-minute class periods. The schedule change will shorten Monday/Wednesday daytime class periods to 50 minutes and add a third weekly class meeting on Fridays. Tuesday/Thursday classes, as well as classes that meet on Saturday or on Monday and Wednesday after 5 p.m., will not experience any schedule changes. 

According to Bruce Hauptli, the Faculty Senate chair, administrators and faculty had been contemplating the change for the past two to three years as part of an initiative to improve the efficiency of classroom use, which also includes giving classrooms technological upgrades and making available an annual class schedule.

The Faculty Senate voted in favor of these measures Oct. 24, and Berkman's announcement that he accepted the Senate's recommendations made it official. Now that it has been decided that FIU's class schedule will change, what remains is to determine how that change will come into effect.

"Will it start with freshmen? Will is start with freshmen and sophomores? Will it start with everyone at once?" Berkman said. 

The job of answering these questions is in the hands of an implementation committee that includes, along with representatives from different administrative departments, two faculty members, three deans and one student representative - Student Government Council at Biscayne Bay Campus President Camilo Silva.

According to Corinne Webb, the committee's chair, a big responsibility the committee will be charged with is helping academic departments plan for providing an annual class schedule. The yearly schedule will tell students what courses will be available up to two semesters ahead of time, what time they will be offered and who will teach them.

The committee will help departments avoid making last-minute schedule changes and generate reports to predict demand for specific courses, Webb said.

According to Berkman, the main reason behind the schedule change is financial. In the State Legislature's past session, an article in a proposed bill said that universities using their classroom space inefficiently could not receive funds for construction and renovation, called PECO funds. FIU ranks lowest among Florida state universities in classroom space utilization. The bill did not pass, but according to Hauptli, it became clear that FIU needed to use its classroom space more efficiently in order to better compete for funding in the future.

"In the next year, we'll almost certainly see legislation saying that universities who don't use at least 65 to 75 percent of their classroom space will receive no PECO funds," Berkman said. "It's a reality that we have to continue to find dollars to build up the University. We have to do it to protect our future, though I'd like to do it in a way that will least impact the students who are furthest along."

Among new additions planned for FIU in the near future are a $55 million science building and a $23 million social sciences building. Both will be financed with PECO funds.

However, Berkman hopes that beyond any financial benefits, the schedule change, in conjunction with the annual schedule, will prove over time to be a "student-friendly" change for the University.

"Students at commuter schools like FIU need two things: they need predictability and they need to have a sense that they're making progress toward their degrees," Berkman said. 

He hopes that in the course of at least two years, he will be able to persuade deans to organize the courses their schools offer in a way that allows students to arrange the courses they take each semester into organized, continuous blocks of time. That way, Berkman said, they might be able to take all their courses, one after the other, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings, for example.

"If I had a magic wand, I would make it so that each student only needs to come to school Monday, Wednesday and Friday one semester and only Tuesday and Thursday the following semester.  Hopefully, we can get for that to happen over time," Berkman said.

Storytelling came to her naturally, so she started writing at a very young age.

"I loved to hear stories, so I wanted to tell stories myself," Weir-Soley said.

She moved to New York in 1983, leaving her homeland behind but not her pride in her Jamaican heritage.

Weir-Soley received her M.A. and Ph. D. in English literature at the University of California in Berkeley and was a teaching assistant at the university for six years.

 She started teaching at FIU in the fall of 1999, and has been an assistant professor ever since.

"I actually enjoy teaching because I see a lot of myself in my students," she said.

Weir-Soley's scholarly interests include spirituality, sexuality, intersections of race and resistance in black women's literature. 

Her work has been published in journals such as Macomere, and Caribbean Writer, among others, and in the anthology Moving Beyond Boundaries.

"She is a brilliant writer and wonderful professor," said Meri-Jane Rochelson, professor of the English department.

Rochelson, who teaches a class with Weir-Soley, believes she brings a diverse view and experience to students at FIU. 

In class, Weir-Soley teaches through the interchange of ideas. Her teaching methods are a revival of the open discussions incited by readings and topics. 

"I really like her class. [Weir-Soley] is passionate about the readings and it transcends when she teaches us," said Liza Olsen, a senior in her comparative working-class women's literature class.

 Felicidad Garcia, an FIU alumna decided to pursue a graduate degree in English after taking classes with Weir-Soley.

"Dr. Weir-Soley helps students find their place in literature; she doesn't teach you to know stories, but to find yourself inside them," Garcia said.

Poetry is among Weir-Soley's various other passions.

She presented from her poetry collection, First Rain, Nov. 18 at the 2006 Miami Book Fair in one of the Caribbean Voices readings.

Headline: Students worry gay initiatives ignored
Author: Jessica Solis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For students like sophomore Danny Anzueto, being gay in college has been a positive experience. He is a leader on campus, taking part in events like Diversity Day. He is also a resident assistant at Bay Vista housing at the Biscayne Bay Campus, and often organizes events for residents.

"It hasn't really been a problem. I have found my space in school with my group of friends that all share the common bond of understanding and openness," Anzueto said.

Anzueto admits, however, that the reason he has not met with any negativity about being gay at BBC is because the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning community has no voice on campus.

"It's pretty sad to think we're a minority on campus and other minorities on campus have more representation," he said.

"We don't have anybody that wants to represent us, so we want to represent us." 

Anzueto is one of several students spearheading an effort to establish an organization at BBC for LGBTQ students, possibly by the spring semester.

In the past, a club for LGBTQ student had success at the campus, but graduating students and shifts in leadership caused the club to become inactive, eventually dissolving.

Cathy Akens, assistant vice president of Student Affairs, along with other administrators, want to see LGBTQ students have that social outlet at BBC.

"The division has had to respond to concern from students who basically express an interest in having a greater support," Akens said.

Students involved in creating the student organization hope that the club can become a place for students to talk to each other and relate to one another's experiences.

 "It is such a scary thought to come into college and to be thrown into this whole new world that you don't really know anything about. Add to this being a student that happens to be gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or transgender only makes the transition into college all that much harder," Anzueto said.

Anzueto and Zena Duque, a senior doing an internship at the Women's Center at BBC have been brainstorming since October about obtaining a center for LGBTQ students and making the office the BBC Stonewall's home base. 

Stonewall Pride Alliance is an active organization on South campus and aids the needs of GLBTQ students and their allies in FIU and the community.

"Students want an outlet to be able to express themselves and have a comfortable environment to congregate without any harassment or anything with negative connotations to it. It would be a safe place for them to come and talk and get resources or just hang out," Duque said.

Creating a new chapter of Stonewall rather than forming a completely separate organization would also unite both campuses,  according to Anzueto.

On Oct.. 11, Bronwen Bares, coordinator for the Center for Leadership and Service and the Women's Center at BBC and Duque helped set up tables for the campus' National Coming Out Day at two locations within and around the Wolfe University Center. 

She said the Women's Center was the only office at BBC who did anything for the event. 

Bares also said the apparent silence from administrators and staff at BBC during National Coming Out Day is a persistent occurrence concerning LGBTQ issues.

"At least on this campus, nobody recognizes these issues and we had very few people come to our tables that day," Bares said. 

"There really aren't any offices that are perceived by the students as a resource [for LGBTQ students]."

Duque has also worked closely with LGBTQ issues, including attending receptions, workshops and Diversity Day on both campuses.

"I think the students are more afraid and intimidated by being able to be who they truly are because they think something negative would come along with it," Duque said.

"I honestly don't see the administrators doing anything to promote the support of students that are LGBTQ or questioning or whatnot." 

Nevertheless, Dr. Rosa Jones, vice-president of student affairs, has established a task force to address these issues after students approached the office concerned with their status last spring.  

"A group of students actually came to me to talk about their experiences, to share that they felt that they were not being served as well as they could be," Jones said.

To better accommodate the task force's objectives, a new position was created in the office of multicultural programs and services.

A.J. Costa is a graduate assistant working on LGBTQ issues through  the MPAS office, though she is based at University Park.

Costa and the MPAS office have started sharing information with the FIU community.

"It's important to make sure that the University community is learning about LGBTQ students and the issues they may face while at FIU in order to create a more welcoming and affirming environment," Costa said.

There is currently no graduate assistant dealing specifically with LGBTQ issues at BBC. 

Anzueto welcomed the possibility of acceptance that the organization can bring.

"This organization would create another facet of diversity within the FIU culture that isn't represented as of yet," Anzueto said.

Anzueto also realized the negative repercussions they might face.

"It's a minority within a minority, so it's something we have to deal with," Anzueto said. 

"We want to make other people understand that everyone wants to belong somewhere. There's a population [at BBC] that doesn't feel like they belong because they don't have representation on this campus," Anzueto said.

Headline: Editorial: SGA did little to inform of class schedule changes
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
On Nov. 27, Interim Provost Ronald Berkman sent a University-wide e-mail announcing that as of Fall 2007, FIU will switch to a daytime Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule.

Faculty and administrators have been discussing this change since Spring 2005, when a committee was formed to find ways to use classroom space more efficiently. The committee presented a set of recommendations, which included the schedule change, to the Faculty Senate. The senate turned it down. After more than a year of discussion among faculty members, the senate recently voted in favor of the schedule change.

Throughout the course of such a long process, shouldn't students have been asked to participate in making this substantial decision, which will affect them as much as it will affect faculty and administrators?

It turns out that they were, in fact, asked to participate. Student government members were invited to participate in the decision-making process. This makes sense: as the elected representatives of the student body, they were asked to represent the students.

However, it was the student representatives themselves who decided to distance themselves from the discussion.

Asked why the Student Government Association has failed to take any initiative to inform students of the schedule change, its possible implications and the reasons for its implementation, Student Government Council at University Park President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon said that he knows little more than what Berkman announced in the e-mail.

"I haven't taken any steps to inform students because my own council isn't even very well-informed about this. We don't want to go to students when we only know the basics ourselves," Leon said. 

According to Bruce Hauptli, the senate chair, Leon was invited to all the Faculty Senate meetings where the schedule change was discussed.

Leon would have been free to voice his comments there, but he didn't. In fact, he didn't even attend the meeting where the change was decided.

 He was also provided with the same committee reports on which the faculty based its decision to vote in favor of the change. In case he misplaced these reports, which contained extensive and detailed information on the schedule change, he could have found them online on the Faculty Senate's webpage, where they are available to the public.

Leon wasn't the only SGA member invited to the table. Berkman said he went to SGA's annual retreat this summer, where he talked to them about the upcoming change for two and a half hours. According to Berkman, he also discussed the topic on multiple occasions with Leon and SGC-BBC President Camilo Silva.

If after all this, our student government felt they had nothing substantial to share with their constituents, or in case they had any questions they wanted cleared up, they could also have taken Berkman up on his offer to attend an SGA meeting and talk about the upcoming change.

"And I would have been glad to go, but they never invited me," Berkman said.

SGA did not take any steps to learn what its constituents thought about the change, either.

Leon disagrees.

"Actually, we did receive student input on this," Leon said. "On our [SGA] webpage, we have a place where students can leave comments for us, and we got between 10 and 12 comments about this."

Indeed. In a remarkable display of statesmanship, he also went so far as to speak to as many as four or five of them personally in his office.

The purpose of student government is to serve as the students' voice in University affairs. In this crucial instance, however, the so-called students' voice did not raise so much as a whisper. 

Whether this happened out of negligence or out of a desire to be team players, in failing to speak for the students, SGA failed to honor its commitment to its constituents.

To their credit, SGA will host at least one student forum about the schedule change early in the Spring semester. However, this is too little, too late. 

Not to worry, though. The implementation committee, which will determine how the schedule change is put into practice, will hold its first meeting at 9 a.m. on Dec. 1 in MARC 530, and under state law, it is open to the public.

Students who wish to speak for themselves when no one else is speaking for them are encouraged to attend.

Headline: Chavez regime threatens democracy
Author: Juan Camilo Estrada /Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Venezuela will be holding its presidential elections Dec. 3, and it is imperative that current President Hugo Chavez be replaced. The stakes: for Latin America to remain free of radical governments that resemble the former Soviet Union and present-day Cuba.

The outcome of these elections is relevant to the general South Florida community, given that, for many of us, our roots lie in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Argentina and other Latin American countries.

Chavez came to power in 1999. Since then, he has polarized Venezuela, alienated and oppressed his opponents, limited the democratic system, mismanaged resources and filled government branches with corruption and mistrust.

Chavez has rampantly suppressed his opposition through violence. According to The Wall Street Journal, on Oct. 16, 2004, protesters demonstrating against irregularities in a national referendum were killed by a militia of Chavez supporters that had been taunting and threatening protesters throughout the day. 

In 2005, he legalized censorship. According to The Washington Post, he amended the penal code to state that "anyone who offends with his words or in writing or in any other way disrespects the President of the Republic or whomever is fulfilling his duties will be punished with prison of 6 to 30 months if the offense is serious and half of that if it is light."

According to the same article, that sanction applies to those who disrespect the president or his functionaries in private. If the offense is public, the term will be increased by a third.

Following the 2002 national referendum that attempted to oust him, Chavez was accused of tampering with electoral procedures. 

According to a study released in 2004 by economists Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard and Roberto Rigobon of MIT, he then manipulated the vote audit supervised by the government's electoral council.

Given the poverty of Latin American countries, it might be expedient to sacrifice freedom to secure the well-being of a country.

However, according to FIU economics professor Jorge Salazar-Carrillo, Chavez's economic management of Venezuela has been disastrous.

Salazar-Carrillo says that, although the price of crude oil has increased, boosting profits in the national reserve, Chavez has pillaged these gains in petty projects that cosmetically improve the economy but achieve no solid and permanent gain.

Salazar-Carrillo also predicts that inflation will increase from l5 percent to 20 percent in the course of this year. Moreover, Venezuela currently shows no growth in its GDP while the national deficit has increased.

Salazar-Carrillo also said that Chavez's exchange of Venezuelan oil for Cuban doctors is an example of the widespread corruption of the  administration. Venezuela exports 110,000 barrels of oil to Cuba daily. Of those 110,000 barrels, only 75,000 are received in Cuba. The other 35,000 are apparently lost along the 1,300-mile-journey.  That adds up to 1.6 million dollars in oil lost each day.

The Chavez regime is nothing but a caricature of a benevolent vision: the vision of Venezuela becoming a socially-just nation. Chavez has twisted, embellished and manufactured democracy to enrich him and his cronies at the expense of the majority - the disadvantaged populace.

Headline: Draft would diminish support for war
Author: Chris Cabral / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With countless lives lost and billions of dollars spent in Iraq, it's only natural to wonder why President Bush and so many other politicians continue to support this war. Would they be so quick to start a war if it were their own sons and daughters in the line of fire? Charles Rangel, Democratic congressman of New York, does not think so. That's why he has called for the reinstitution of the draft.

"There's no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm's way," said Rangel in The Nation.

This is a valuable point that needs to be made, and I thank Rangel for making it. I am also thankful that his resolution hasn't a chance in hell of passing. While a draft would spread the burden of war more evenly - at least in theory - neither party seems likely to support it, and I'm glad. A draft would also put others at risk as well. Young people who were wise enough to oppose this war from the very beginning should not be forced to help perpetuate it.

So while I oppose the draft, I support Rangel's decision to propose it. His resolution raises important questions, and helps promote much needed debate regarding the merits of the continuation of this war.

Discussions of the draft evoke memories of Vietnam, Korea and other wars of questionable motives. Like the generations before us, today there are those who oppose the war and those who support it. 

Yet there is one crucial difference between today's pro-war youth and the youth of years past: unlike previous generations, many of the war's young supporters today are free to advocate the war without having to wonder if they will be the next person sent to fight, and possibly die, for motives grounded in the ether of political ideology. For them, the war is a concept, a preference, and just a matter of personal taste, like supporting a rock band or a certain brand of soda. Yet when it comes to actually serving in Iraq, far too many of them would rather stay home.

 In light of the apparent shortage of troops needed to fight a war they so vocally endorse, it is time for those young partisans who like to call their opponents "cut and run" cowards to demonstrate their bravery by joining the Marines.





Perhaps a few might oblige. However, something tells me that most would rather say they support the troops than become one. 

To those pro-war students I must respectfully ask: If you're not willing to fight and die in Iraq, why are you so eager to let others die for you?

FIU among top 25 places to work in Miami

Living.Real.Miami magazine recently declared FIU one of the 25 best places to work in Miami. 

In LRM's October issue, what set FIU apart from the others was the 41-page employee benefits handbook, which includes access to free education for all FIU employees and their families and medical benefits for faculty/staff with same-sex partners.

In August, the Division of Human Resources announced a plan to extend full FIU benefits to temporary employees. Also, earlier this semester, FIU announced it would hire outsourced custodial employees with 50 percent higher pay and full benefits.

As part of its research, LRM turned to the Job Satisfaction Survey for 2006, the Great Place to Work Institute and the U.S. Department of Labor statistics to create a list of criteria to rate local businesses.

Other winning companies on the list included Baptist Health South Florida, Washington Mutual and The Container Store.



Faculty research deadline fast approaching

Faculty members yearning to get started on research may receive up to $25,000 this year. 

This year, the Office of the Provost and the FIU Foundation have teamed up to fund the program at a minimum of $250,000.

Projects submitted by eligible faculty, tenured and tenure-earning, will be considered for awards of up to $25,000 for projects conducted for a period of up to 12 months. 

The deadline to submit all research proposals is 5 p.m., Dec. 4. For additional information, call (305) 348-2494.

FIU's Executive MBA program ranks No. 78 in a recent Financial Times survey of EMBA's programs. This is the first year FIU is included in the annual ranking, which also ranks the university program No. 1 in Florida and No. 5 in the South.

The Financial Times ranking is based on the quality of the EMBA's alumni, school and program quality, as well as the research capabilities of the faculty.



Education professor cited as one of 'America's Best Leaders'

Robert Moses, eminent scholar in FIU's Center for Urban Education and Innovation, was named one of "America's Best Leaders" in U.S. News & World Report's Oct. 30 issue. 

Moses, a civil rights activist and educator, was singled out along with national luminaries as retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and Broad Institute Director Eric Lander.

The magazine teamed with the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government to identify leaders "who are making a difference."

The recognition cites Moses' advocacy for the poor and innovative Algebra Project program, which provides math instruction to minority students in the form of kindergarten-through-high-school curricula guides, teacher training and peer coaching.

Headline: Club helps international students adjust to new life
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Born and raised in Peru, sophomore Gabriella Santos came to Miami to study at FIU Spring 2005, without knowing anybody in the University.

At her international students orientation session, she learned about a club that programmed events specifically for international students. On a whim, she attended a movie night that the organization hosted. Santos eventually became the 2005-2006 secretary of that very group - the International Students Club.

To Santos, the club provided a sense of belonging that helped her connect with FIU's international student population.

"The main reason I joined was the people," Santos said. "The students I met through the club shared the same experiences as me because we were all international students. We're all attending a school in a different country than the one we were raised in."

Overseen by the Student Organizations Council, the governing body of more than 200 clubs, ISC at University Park strives to foster a fun environment for international students such as Santos. According to ISC Vice President Jose Boubou, the club has more than 200 members but admits not all of the members are active.

"We have over 200 members signed up to our e-mail list, but obviously not all of them come to our events or attend the meetings," Boubou said. "We're students, and sometimes scheduling doesn't work out."

Although some members fail to partake in the club's events, other members participate in the activities, which include local art gallery visits and intramural soccer games as well as dinners and parties held throughout each semester. The club's most recent activity was a Thanksgiving dinner held in the University Park Towers. Prior to the dinner, the club helped organize a Nov. 9 party at Gracie's Grill known as "Unidad: The Traffic Light Edition." That party, according to Boubou, was a huge step for the club because of the collaboration involved.

"That party was a big success for our club because of the number of clubs that were involved in organizing it," Boubou said. "We worked with a lot of clubs that have a lot of international students, such as the Caribbean Students Association and Nicaraguan Students Association. It was an effective way of uniting everyone in a fun atmosphere."

Despite its recent successes, the club has had its share of struggles. Last year, all of the members on the 2004-2005 executive board either graduated or moved on to different projects, according to Santos. Their departures left a difficult obstacle for the incoming executive board to overcome: a lack of experience in running an organization.

"Last year was more of a rebuilding year for the club because the old executive board moved on and the new members of the board had little experience," Santos said. "Also, some of the old members were graduate students so it was difficult for them to make time around their studies."

Boubou agreed.

"The lack of experience hurt the club's organization and attendance but we still had the events to keep students entertained," Boubou said.

Sophomore Antonio Carrillo, current president of ISC, says this year is an improvement and more events are in store for students this school year.

"There has been a rise in participation, and we try to have three to four events every month, from beach trips to intramural games," Carrillo said.

With the variety of events hosted each month, ISC tries to cater to a part of the FIU community that is often overlooked by other organizations, according to Boubou.

"There aren't really any clubs that cater to the entire international community at the University, and a lot of current clubs don't really offer much programming dedicated to international students," Boubou said. "ISC wants to unite that whole community and give it something to do in terms of fun events and making friends."

More information about the ISC at UP can be found at the Graham Center, room 355.

Headline: 17-hour shift nearly kills seasonal employee
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
So this is the price I pay to make an extra couple of dollars for the holidays.

The Friday that follows Thanksgiving is infamously known as Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year where stores usually offer some of the best sales of the holiday season.

If the prices for televisions, clothes, shoes, toys and all sorts of fancy gadgets are lowered for this particular day, then what's there not to love about it?

Just ask the guy standing behind the register that day. Better yet, ask me.

That day, I worked a 17-hour shift (4 a.m. - 10 p.m.) in the MP3 players section at the Circuit City in Pembroke Pines - it felt like an eternity plus four hours.

The experience was horrible mainly because of my aching feet. The mere sight of one iPod after another didn't help either. Instead of selling iPods, I felt like throwing them against the nearest wall. Twice.

My morning or night (whatever you want to consider 4 a.m.) started when I pulled in through the back of the plaza so I could avoid any long lines.

Talk about false expectations. 

There was a line of people that stretched all the way to the back of the store at 3:45 a.m.

Unfortunately, I didn't go to sleep the previous day because I was awake talking with friends and family at a Thanksgiving party. Instead of forcing myself to wake up the next day, I chose to pull an all-nighter before heading out to Circuit City for work. 

The whole time I was thinking, "How hectic could it be, right?"

As soon as the doors opened at 5 a.m., a wave of people flooded my section, which was manned by my coworker Willy and me.

Watching dozens of people rush me simultaneously, I realized what a mistake I had made by not getting any sleep. I really could have used those three or four hours of rest prior to this impending onslaught.

I must have answered a million questions about MP3 players and billions more about the 

iPod (I hope Steve Jobs knows he ruined my life that day).

Did I mention how bad my feet were hurting?

But whenever everything seemed to overwhelm me, some customer managed to brighten my day with some dumb question or comment that made me smile for a split second before realizing I had 15 hours left until my shift finished.

Despite the long lines, there were some memorable moments.

The funniest thing I heard all day was someone screaming at another Circuit City employee that he had been waiting in line for three hours to buy a computer even though we had just opened the doors half an hour ago.

And then there were those customers who loved to lecture employees when an item was out of stock. Some old man started preaching to me: "How are you going to sell something with no accessories. It's like buying a car with no tires."

Thanks for the analogy sir, but we just ran out, so get over it.

Besides those incidents and the 25 other times I wanted to slap somebody upside the head, it was a pretty normal day.

But unfortunately for me, I got lucky because nobody really fought or got nasty with one another. I managed to escape the chaotic sales floor by taking any type of break I could think of: lunch break, bathroom break, water break and cigarette break (I don't even smoke). Sometimes the journey coming back from my breaks took longer than my actual breaks because 40 customers would sack me before reaching the end zone.

Once I was back at my post, I had to deal with the most annoying part of my job: the broken sliding glass door to the MP3 case. Talk about embarrassing: a line of agitated and impatient people, and you can't open a simple sliding glass door. It's almost like they want me to look like a seasonal untrained employee.

But it wasn't all that bad, I made a couple of people smile that day and made some extra cash.

Scratch that last sentence; my feet are starting to hurt again.So this is the price I pay to make an extra couple of dollars for the holidays.

The Friday that follows Thanksgiving is infamously known as Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year where stores usually offer some of the best sales of the holiday season.

If the prices for televisions, clothes, shoes, toys and all sorts of fancy gadgets are lowered for this particular day, then what's there not to love about it?

Just ask the guy standing behind the register that day. Better yet, ask me.

That day, I worked a 17-hour shift (4 a.m. - 10 p.m.) in the MP3 players section at the Circuit City in Pembroke Pines - it felt like an eternity plus four hours.

The experience was horrible mainly because of my aching feet. The mere sight of one iPod after another didn't help either. Instead of selling iPods, I felt like throwing them against the nearest wall. Twice.

My morning or night (whatever you want to consider 4 a.m.) started when I pulled in through the back of the plaza so I could avoid any long lines.

Talk about false expectations. 

There was a line of people that stretched all the way to the back of the store at 3:45 a.m.

Unfortunately, I didn't go to sleep the previous day because I was awake talking with friends and family at a Thanksgiving party. Instead of forcing myself to wake up the next day, I chose to pull an all-nighter before heading out to Circuit City for work. 

The whole time I was thinking, "How hectic could it be, right?"

As soon as the doors opened at 5 a.m., a wave of people flooded my section, which was manned by my coworker Willy and me.

Watching dozens of people rush me simultaneously, I realized what a mistake I had made by not getting any sleep. I really could have used those three or four hours of rest prior to this impending onslaught.

I must have answered a million questions about MP3 players and billions more about the 

iPod (I hope Steve Jobs knows he ruined my life that day).

Did I mention how bad my feet were hurting?

But whenever everything seemed to overwhelm me, some customer managed to brighten my day with some dumb question or comment that made me smile for a split second before realizing I had 15 hours left until my shift finished.

Despite the long lines, there were some memorable moments.

The funniest thing I heard all day was someone screaming at another Circuit City employee that he had been waiting in line for three hours to buy a computer even though we had just opened the doors half an hour ago.

And then there were those customers who loved to lecture employees when an item was out of stock. Some old man started preaching to me: "How are you going to sell something with no accessories. It's like buying a car with no tires."

Thanks for the analogy sir, but we just ran out, so get over it.

Besides those incidents and the 25 other times I wanted to slap somebody upside the head, it was a pretty normal day.

But unfortunately for me, I got lucky because nobody really fought or got nasty with one another. I managed to escape the chaotic sales floor by taking any type of break I could think of: lunch break, bathroom break, water break and cigarette break (I don't even smoke). Sometimes the journey coming back from my breaks took longer than my actual breaks because 40 customers would sack me before reaching the end zone.

Once I was back at my post, I had to deal with the most annoying part of my job: the broken sliding glass door to the MP3 case. Talk about embarrassing: a line of agitated and impatient people, and you can't open a simple sliding glass door. It's almost like they want me to look like a seasonal untrained employee.

But it wasn't all that bad, I made a couple of people smile that day and made some extra cash.

Scratch that last sentence; my feet are starting to hurt again.
