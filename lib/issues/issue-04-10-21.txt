Subheadline: Construction rush may actually slow growth and future of a maturing university
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In many ways, current construction projects at FIU can be compared to a small town growing into a city. The difference at FIU is that university administrators continually use choice phrases such as "improvement," "expansion" and "construction" to justify the need to not only build but to do it at once.

Although interest rates get higher and construction materials grow increasingly more expensive, FIU finds it easier to begin new buildings, hoping to stay under budget. 

It is reasonable for President Modesto A. Maidique to argue that construction needs to happen at some point in a university's history, but must it all happen at once? Are students going to get what they pay for? In some cases, no.  

FIU has failed to realize many unforeseen problems that can delay or halt the construction of these buildings. Several projects including the expansion of the Graham Center at the University Park campus and the renovation of the Wolfe University Center gym at the Biscayne Bay campus have been in the works for months, but it could be another six months before anyone will be able to use these facilities. 

The recreation center at UP for instance, was to have been completed before the fall of 2004 but now, only a portion of the new gym will open in early Nov. Students were promised a new gym this fall, but many won't be feeling the burn until January of 2005. Along with partially opened facilities, many students and faculty are bombarded with new entrances and pathways that some feel have them running around in circles. This confusion may be attributed to the lack of information available to students and faculty.  

 Although a lack of funding, failed inspections and even hurricanes are to blame for many of these "discrepancies," it could be months before students are able to reap the benefits of these new facilities. 

Before starting new projects, FIU administrators must remember that the future of FIU depends on sound decisions made for the right reasons at the right time. Growth that comes too quickly can stunt a university's future and ultimately of its students as well.

Headline: A win for Kerry will depend on Florida
Author: James Valle / FIU College Democrats President
&nbsp;
It's finally over!  That has to be what the Bush campaign is thinking now that the debate cycle is over.  It was a complete 3-0 sweep for Kerry with a CNN poll saying viewers thought Kerry won by a 52-39% margin.  Now the real work begins, not only for the campaigns, but for us as the voters.

History has shown us that debate winners give themselves a great opportunity to win elections; however, it does not guarantee it. 

What wins elections is voter turnout and voter mobilization. Florida voters have absolutely no excuse for not voting in this immensely important election.  

For one, we have the opportunity to vote early two weeks prior to the election which makes the excuse, "I didn't have time to go to the polls," null and void.  Secondly, this election will come down to two states: Florida and Ohio.  

The best website to see state by state polling data is www.electoral-vote.com.  With the use of this site and its results, any which way you break it down, the fact is that, for Bush to win reelection, he needs to carry both Ohio and Florida.

The opportunity for Democrats to avenge the decision of the 2000 election by the conservative Supreme Court and not the voters has been served to us on a silver platter.  The latest USA Today Florida poll gives Kerry a 50-49% edge.  

Although it is a statistically insignificant lead, it shows beyond a doubt that we can carry this state and give Kerry the presidency.  Although we can hope and expect that Ohio and its depressing job market will give Kerry the state, we cannot depend on others to choose our president.  

Kerry also holds a huge 53-37% lead among first time voters, which means that college students, many of whom are first- time voters, will have the grand opportunity to make a mark on this paper-thin close election.  In 2000 less than 50% of registered voters voted and only about 49% of those voters chose George W. Bush for president.  That means only a quarter of the US population chose Bush for president in 2000 and all of us had to live with the consequences.  We as the future of this country cannot allow this to happen again.

The stakes are clear. This country is on a path to nowhere and Bush is the navigator.  This country needs a president who will talk straight with the American people and fight for the middle class, the backbone of this great nation.  

For those who may still have thoughts about Kerry being a "flip-flopper" I ask you this final question: What's worse, changing your position based on new facts that become available to you or changing the facts to conveniently fit your positions?  I ask for your vote on behalf of John Kerry so we can truly become stronger at home and more respected in the world.

Headline: Golden Panthers blow 17-0 lead
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Louisiana-Monroe (2-4) overcame a 17-point first half deficit to beat the Golden Panthers (2-2) 28-20 at Malone Stadium on Oct. 16th. 

ULM quarterback, Steven Jyles, led the Indians to their second win of the year, completing 25-of-41 passes for 303 yards and two touchdowns. 

Jyles added 45 yards and a touchdown on the ground as the Indians snapped a six game home losing streak and won their first series of back-to-back games since 1999. 

The junior quarterback was named the Sun-Belt Conference Offensive Player of the Week.

FIU jumped to an early 14-0 lead in the first quarter thanks to good defensive play. 

The Golden Panthers' defense forced the Indians to punt from their own 11-yard line on ULM's first possession and safety John Haritan blocked the punt and recovered it for a touchdown. It was the first blocked punt for a TD in FIU history. 

With 3:18 left in the first, Josh Padrick completed a one-yard touchdown pass to Adam Gorman to give the Golden Panthers a two-touchdown lead. Adam Moss made it a 17-0 game with a 44-yard field goal.

Jyles got the Indians back in the game with a 16-yard touchdown run just before the end of the first half. It was mostly Indians from that point on. 

"Hats off to them," said Head Coach Don Strock. "They played very well in the second half and won the football game. We had opportunities, but we're not taking care of the little things right now, and those were the things that really hurt us."

Defensively, the Golden Panthers broke down in the second half. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Jyles connected with sophomore receiver Drouzon Quillen on a 76-yard TD pass. Ten minutes later Jyles hit Floyd Smith on a 26-yard pass good for six more points, making it 21-17 Indians. 

Strock's team made it back to within one on the leg of Adam Moss as he booted another field goal from more than 40 yards, this time hitting from 42. 

But with 4:25 left in the fourth and a chance to execute another heroic comeback, Josh Padrick fumbled the ball and ULM's Chaz Williams ran it back 15 yards for the score, sealing the game for the Indians. 

"Our defense played tremendous in the second half," said ULM Head Coach Charlie Weatherbie. "We forced a couple of turnovers, one that was a difference in the ball game."

Padrick finished with 25 completions for 217 yards, but was only 4-of-11 passing in the final quarter. 

Rashod Smith carried the ball 17 times for 60 yards for the Golden Panthers and Sammuel Smith, Corey McKinney and Harold Leath each had six receptions. 

The Golden Panthers have lost two games against Sun-Belt Conference opponents this year, both to teams from Louisiana. 

The two wins have come against talented Division I-AA programs; yet they are still in search of their first win over a Division I-A school. 

FIU plays their second home game on Nov. 23rd hosting McNeese State. The Cowboys were ranked number one in the nation last year for 11 of 13 weeks.

After the game, there will be a free post game concert featuring rappers Method Man and Redman. 

Fans must arrive prior to the start of the third quarter in order to watch the one-hour concert.

&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers traveled to Philadelphia and kicked off a three game road trip, their longest trip of the season, at Ravenhill Field on Oct. 15. 

The game started out slowly, as the teams were not able to get their offense going, both teams went into halftime tied at zero.

Eventually the offense showed up in the second half, combining for a total of seven goals, resulting in a 5-2 FIU victory. 

The win improves the Golden Panthers' overall record to 5-4-0 and 3-0 in the Atlantic Soccer Conference, while the Rams fall to 2-11-0 and 0-2 in conference.

The offensive assault began when forward Oscar Gil found the back of the net and recorded his second goal of the season in the 51st minute of the match. 

The Rams responded quickly tying the game at 1-1 on Ramiro Vengoecha's second goal of the season. The goal came just 91 seconds after FIU's first strike.

The Golden Panthers recovered promptly, regaining their lead on Jean Camere's 55th minute goal on an assist from Gil. 

The 2-1 lead did not last long though, as freshman midfielder Mike Millar scored his fifth goal of the season for the Rams and knotted the score at 2-2 in 65th minute of play.

From here, it was all FIU, as they rallied to score three more goals while shutting down Philadelphia's offense for the remainder of the match. 

David Hope provided the game-winning goal, putting the Golden Panthers ahead 3-2 at the 76:24 mark. 

FIU sealed the victory with two more goals from Mario Franca and Camere, who scored his first multi-goal game of the season.

Coach Karl Kremser was pleased with the scoring from his team in the final 45 mintues.

"We did a nice job adjusting and scoring goals in the second half," said Kremser.

The Golden Panthers freshmen goalkeeper Andres Arguello picked up his first career win when he replaced an injured Shawn Crowe with the score tied at 2-2. 

"It's unfortunate that Shawn couldn't finish but Andres stepped in and did a nice job for us," said Kremser.



FIU 2, Howard 0 



The Golden Panthers picked up right where they left off on against Philadelphia as the team shut out Howard University 2-0 on Oct. 17 at Greene Stadium. 

The game proved to be of no contest, as FIU recorded their third consecutive shutout against the Bison.

The Golden Panthers went ahead in the 28th minute of the match when David Hope connected for his fourth goal of the season on an assist by Carron Williams and Mario Franca. 

Hope proved to be too much for the Howard defenders to handle, as he put on a one-man show, recording his second multi-goal game of the season.

Hope registered his second goal of the game when he found the back of the net, on a broken play, in front of the goal. 

The two goals placed Hope in a tie with Fernando Plentz for the team lead with five this season.

Kremser likes the way Hope is playing.

"David has been outstanding for us. He just continues to find the net and score goals," Kremser said.

With the shutout the Golden Panthers won their second consecutive game and improved to a perfect 4-0-0 in the conference and 6-4 overall. 

The Bison dropped to 2-7-2 overall and 1-1-0 in the ASC competition.

The two victories were key road defeats for Kremser's team.

"I'm pleased with our overall performance. We were able to pick up two conference road wins, which puts us in good position with only two conference games remaining," Kremser said.

FIU will have a week off before traveling to Jacksonville for an Oct. 26 match up.

&nbsp;
The volleyball team suffered another blow with its tenth consecutive loss on Oct. 14 at Earl K. Long Gym in Lafayette, Louisiana. 

The 3-2 loss against Louisiana-Lafayette also marks the team's sixth consecutive loss, keeping them winless, in Sun-Belt Conference play and dropping its overall record to 1-16.

Despite the loss, the Golden Panthers showed signs of life with outstanding individual play.  Sophomore Oksana Zabalueva recorded a career-high 26 kills and Junior Laura Vogel added another 11 kills and 11 digs.

In game one, a 30-24 win for FIU, Freshman Dyionna Smith led the offense with 17 assists. 

Freshman Ruth Fleming and Zabalueva added five kills apiece and Vogel contributing with four kills, six digs, and two blocks. 

The Ragin' Cajuns tied up the match in game two with a 30-23 win, which featured 16 errors for FIU compared to six for UL. 

Zabalueva led the Golden Panthers with six kills.

Game three, a 30-25 win for the Cajuns, featured a match-high eight tie scores early on, but errors eventually did FIU in, despite having come  within two points of the Cajuns late in the game. 

In game four, FIU scored the first five points of the match and never looked back as they forced a fifth game with a dominant 30-22 win.  Zabalueva led the Golden Panthers with eight kills.

 Ultimately, however, the Golden Panthers were put away in the decisive game five, 15-9. For the match, FIU committed 41 errors compared to 31 for the Ragin' Cajuns.



FIU 3, NT 0



The Golden Panthers got a much needed victory on Oct. 16, 2004 sweeping Sun-Belt Conference foe, North Texas, 3-0. 

 The win snapped a ten game losing streak and was FIU's first Conference road win in almost a year. FIU's record now stands at 2-15 and 1-6 in the Sun-Belt Conference.

Oksana Zabalueva led FIU in kills for the second consecutive match with 18 and freshman Alyse Santisi added 17 digs. 

Ruth Fleming added 10 kills to go along with 13 digs and Dyionna Smith added her own 13 to couple her outstanding 45 assists.  Also, Laura Vogel contributed another 11 kills.

Smith also helped out the offense with 14 assists and five digs.

In game two, FIU pulled away late for another 30-27 win. Zabalueva led FIU offensively with six kills while Santisi added an important 11 digs.

The Mean Green fought hard in the third game turning an early six-point deficit into a late four-point lead. 

In the end, however, the lady Golden Panthers were not about to let up and came back to win 31-29. To no one's surprise, Zabalueva led FIU with eight kills.

The women's volleyball team returns home to action versus Denver at 7:00 p.m. on Oct. 22 in the Pharmed Arena.

Headline: Democrat says Bush policies ignore Latinos
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
As the war in Iraq makes the American public turn its attention to the Middle East, many feel U.S. policy has ignored other regions of the world in the last few years.

In a lecture on Oct. 18 in the University Park's Graham Center Ballroom, Robert Menendez, Democratic congressman for New Jersey, stated the ignorance of other world regions to be a major election year problem, especially when it comes to policies dealing with South America and the Caribbean.

The son of Cuban immigrants, Menendez is the chairman of the Democratic Caucus and the third-highest ranking Democrat in the U.S. House. Invited to FIU by the Cuban Research Institute and the Latin American and Caribbean Center, the congressman avidly supports  Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry for President.

Jorge Ramos, anchorman for Noticiero Univision, introduced Menendez. Ramos began by saying that, even though the first presidential debate of this election year was held in Miami, neither candidate mentioned  issues relevant to the Hispanic minority.

"When the candidates came to Miami ... we expected them to talk about Latin America, but something happened. We expected them to address our issues, but instead, something happened: nothing was said," Ramos said.

After the introduction, Menendez took the podium, giving a brief introduction in Spanish before moving on to directly attack the Bush administration's lack of acknowledgment of South American and Caribbean issues.

"In the last four years, the Bush administration has had no policy on Latin America," he said. "Any ties or regulations that might or should have been made are nonexistent."

By pointing out how Bush's fiscal budget for Latin America was cut by 11 percent during his term in office, Menendez argued that programs such as military aid and childcare funding for developing Latin nations were severely restricted.

The congressman noted several statistics dealing with problems in what he called "our own front yard," like the fact that 44 percent of Latin Americans live in poverty and that more than 20 percent are malnourished.

Menendez also stated that the U.S. relationship with communist Cuba is an area of importance ignored by the Bush administration.

"Why has this happened?" Menendez asked the crowd.

To answer the question, he quoted Colin Powell's recent press remarks, "With respect to Latin America, we reduced the amount of funding because we have other priorities."

The congressman argued that any candidate's top issue should be to oust Fidel Castro.

Backing Kerry, Menendez said the senator's position on the Cuban embargo would allow for regulations on principled travel, which will allow Cuban-Americans to visit their families while placing restrictions on tourism.

During a question session following the lecture, Menendez commented on topics such as freedom of the press, Cubans held in Guantanamo prisons and the next generation of Cuban-Americans and Latinos.

He ended by stating that the fight to liberate Cuba and all countries under oppression should be a goal of great importance even to those who are children of immigrants.

"I myself have been fighting all my life for a land I've yet to know," he said.

Polio may be extinguished by 2005

According to researchers, polio could be eliminated worldwide by next year.

From India to Nigeria, an army of vaccinators began in mid-October what they hope will be the final push in a 16-year-long effort to wipe the crippling disease from the face of the earth.

Polio, which ran rampant in 125 countries when the campaign was launched in 1988, has been reported in 16 countries this year, but health officials say it remains a serious local risk in just six countries-India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger and Egypt. In each of those, thousands of local leaders have been recruited to make sure every child younger than five receives the vaccine.

But stamping out the stubborn virus has proved elusive and expensive-$3 billion to date.

Still, with persistence, the vaccinators may yet succeed. This year, India has had only 68 cases, the fewest ever at this point in the year.

Polio, the disease that paralyzed President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, generally strikes young children and typically leaves victims without the use of one or both legs for life.

Three years after Sept. 11, New York City sees new jobs

After three long years, New York City's job market is humming with 51,000 new jobs created this year and another 70,000 expected in 2005.

The growth is reflected in a wide range of areas, including clothing retail, health care, accounting, tourism, transportation and real estate.

Home retail stores like Target and Home Depot have added hundreds of new positions.

But the news isn't as rosy in all sectors. Jobs in finance, insurance, construction and manufacturing continue to disappear.

The Sept. 11, 2001 attacks devastated the city's job market. Between August 2001 and August 2002, New York residents lost 70,000. The following year, another 68,000 followed suit.

Since then, though, there has been a marked increase in new jobs.

The home health industry has grown by more than 10 percent, with agencies bringing in more than 4,400 new workers to serve an increasingly aging population. 

Analysts also are upbeat about the 4,000 real estate jobs created this past year, meaning more people are becoming homeowners.

Yiddish makes comeback in universities

Almost extinguished by the Holocaust, then lost in the memories of aging survivors, Yiddish-a language brought to the U.S. by Eastern European Jewish immigrants-is now emerging as a respected academic discipline.

Before World War II, three-quarters of the world's 17 million Jews spoke Yiddish, mostly in Eastern and Central Europe. Today, linguists believe the number to be less than one million.

Over the past few years, a young generation of linguists has begun learning the language at universities such as Stanford, the University of California-Berkeley and an estimated 50 other schools. Scholars hope its rich literary, poetic and musical tradition can be saved.

While there has been off-and-on interest at Stanford in recent decades, this year the university committed to a three-year program-long enough for students to gain some fluency. In addition to the language class, which has five students, others who already speak some Yiddish are reading literature by such authors as Sholom Aleichem.

The birth of Yiddish can be traced back to around the 10th century, when Jews left France and Italy to escape persecution and settled in towns along the Rhine. The new language was a dialect of German, written phonetically using the Hebrew alphabet. It borrowed from Hebrew, French, Italian and Slavic languages.

Headline: Program brings diversity awareness to students
Author: Gretel Sarmiento  / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
No matter what ethnic background a student might be, all are welcomed to celebrate diversity on Oct. 21 at the Wolfe University Center Ballroom at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Sponsored by the Student Government Association, Diversity Awareness Day is an annual symposium now celebrating its fifth year, bringing together students of all backgrounds and races.

The event is open to the entire FIU community. It will begin at 10:45 a.m. and continue throughout the day. Phillip Milano, author of "I Can't Believe You Asked That" and creator of the online ethnic discussion board, the Y? Forum will be holding a lecture. Students will be able to ask questions and give their opinions at the end of the discussion.

Students will also be able to see "The Bathtub," a 25-minute play created by Ami Domini and performed by Diane Newman, a professor at the School of Hospitality, and Dina Wagner, an eighth grade student from the St. Rose of Lima School. For sociable students, a luncheon will be served  from 12:45 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. to taste cuisines from all over the world.

In addition, the event has two contests lined up. The first is a poster contest, in which students design posters related to food, people or any other topic dealing with diversity.

The second contest is a writing contest, with the theme of "The Impact of Diversity in the United States." The first prize will be $100. Winners of both competitions will be announced during the celebration.

According to SPC, the event's purpose is to make students aware of the benefits of cultural diversity, to stimulate them to learn about other cultures and to help them expand their views and knowledge through interaction with other students.

"In celebrating [diversity], we bring awareness to the people," said Arminda Pravia, accountant for Campus Life and chairperson of the diversity program.

This year, SGA has campaigned hard to promote students' involvement in this event.

Flyers have been distributed all over campus, and with the cooperation of volunteers and the support of committee members, such as BBC Provost Raul Moncarz, around 250 visitors are expected to attend the symposium this year.

All BBC clubs and organizations have also been invited to attend the event.

Pravia hopes students will take advantage of this day to gain a better understanding of foreign traditions and customs they might not be aware of.

"We can visit the whole world right here," Pravia said. "It's a learning experience ... we want students to be able to understand one another."

&nbsp;
The music could be heard from across campus along with the cheers and laughter of students swinging to its beat.

Latin bands from across the country and abroad joined together at FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus on Oct. 15 for the Latin Fusion Explosion concert, organized by the Student Programming Council not only to entertain, but to promote Hispanic heritage.

This was Latin Fusion's sixth year, and it featured six performers that played a "fusion" of rock, ska, reggae and reggaeton, influenced by everything from dance to oldies. Admission was $5 for students, though some were admitted for free with the purchase of a Vitaminwater from the FIU Bookstore.

Many students agreed that, on Friday night, the Wolfe University Center Ballroom was the place to be. The event began at 9:00 p.m. and lasted until 2:00 a.m.

"If you weren't dancing, you could definitely feel the floor shaking," said Mauricio Hernandez, a junior.

It took three months, a staff of approximately 30 people and help from such sponsors as Toyota Scion and Red Bull for SPC to organize the event. Blue Cafe also played a big part in the event, catering during the press conference that took place on Oct. 14 and hosting the event's after party on Friday night.

Though it took many people to get the concert going, Rafael Zapata, associate director of BBC's Campus Life, saw to its overall planning. He is also the brother of the concert's host, Nelson "Sabrozzo" Zapata, founding member of the band Proyecto Uno.

Performers included the Miami band, Van Solo, Taboo Bambu and Notch as well as a solo performance by Zayra Alvarez. Different cultures influenced the bands' diverse musical styles. 

Many performers were from different countries such as Puerto Rico, Panama, Venezuela, Belize and the Dominican Republic, while others came from U.S. cities like New York and Miami.  

While many of the bands played that night, Caramelos De Cianuro and Rabanes were considered the main performers. 

"Their excellence represents Venezuelan rock," said Boris Rabinovici, a junior and a big fan of the Caramelos.

Panamanian Latin rock trio, Rabanes, also caused a lot of excitement in the crowd.

The band has earned a Latin Grammy nomination and is known for their unique sound, described as a  fusion of ska, Caribbean, reggae, rap and rock.

Despite playing last,  at a time when the Ballroom was not as crowded, Rabanes still managed to keep the place entertained and the crowd rocking until late into the night.

All the proceeds gathered during the concert by SPC will be used to fund future events for the BBC community.

Headline: Beastie Boys tackle politics, Big Apple pride on new record
Author: Michael Hamersly / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Who would have thought after 1986's Licensed to Ill that Beastie Boys, three gleefully snotty punks from Brooklyn, would go on to become one of the most influential rap acts of all time?

But here they are: stylistic trendsetters, harbingers of hip, having schooled sucker MCs with their fresh beats and ill rhymes for two decades.

It would have been easy, even natural, to dismiss the often clownish trio (MCA, Ad-Rock and Mike D) as a novelty after their frat-house anthem "Fight For Your Right" inevitably grew as stale as morning-after keg beer. 

Luckily, Beastie Boys got sick of the party-animal personas in which they became trapped, says Mike D in a phone interview from New York.

"It was tons of fun making Licensed to Ill, but as that tour dragged on, and night after night we had to become these caricatures we put forward on the record, it became a real drag for us," he says. "We had a good time, but we definitely wanted to do something different."

What an understatement. Their funky follow-up album, Paul's Boutique, with the production help of the Dust Brothers, became a hip-hop landmark, a huge influence on countless artists, most notably Beck. 

And yet, few took Beastie Boys seriously.

"With Paul's Boutique, the attitude was still like 'three idiots create a masterpiece,'" says Mike D. "It still seemed like it was a total accident."

Many of their fans criticized them for evolving.

"People who thought we'd come up with another 'Fight For Your Right' were like, 'What are you giving us?'" he recalls. "And then years later, it's like, 'Awww, Paul's Boutique is my favorite album!'"

But as Beastie Boys matured, their street cred and hipster quotient skyrocketed, perhaps topped by their video for "Sabotage," a delirious send-up of '70s TV cop shows directed by Spike Jonze. 

Today, there are few artists who evoke more of a New York state of mind. 

The trio's latest album, To the 5 Boroughs - a return to Beastie Boys' old-school rap roots after experiments in psychedelia, electro and even techno - is at once a solemn tribute to the Big Apple, an anti-Bush political statement and a raucous celebration of New Yorkers' irreverent spirit.

"There are definitely parts of the record where we're just joking around and trying to make each other laugh," says Mike D, "and there's other times when we're all here, living in New York, making a record in New York post-9/11, within walking distance from ground zero. And we can't help but comment on things going on every day. We come into the studio every morning and the front page of The New York Times is talking about whatever actions the Bush administration is taking at that moment.

"I think it'd be almost dishonest for us not to have that work its way into what we're doing," he continues. "We'd have to purposefully ignore that, block it out."

But as serious as they've shown they can be - the To the 5 Boroughs cover features a drawing of the New York skyline, complete with the World Trade Center, while the song "An Open Letter to NYC" is a straight-up, loving tribute to their city - it's not like Beastie Boys are on a crusade to save the world.

"Nah - it's like we couldn't not speak out," Mike D explains. "We literally couldn't help ourselves. We couldn't leave that bottled up. It's not like we're desperately serious people all the time. Most of the time we're sitting around enjoying ourselves. ... But when something you love so much that's been such a big part of your life is endangered, of course you're gonna reflect on it."

As politically outspoken as Beastie Boys have become - on the recent song "In A World Gone Mad," Mike D attacks President Bush in humorous fashion: "You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day/with the cocaine and the Courvoisier" - no way does Mike D harbor any political aspirations after Beastie Boys pass the mic for the last time.

"I encourage people who are ready for it to do it," he says, "but I don't think I can live in such a venomous arena and remain unscathed.

"I can be an armchair quarterback," he says, meaning he can convey his message to the masses without actually entering into the political ring.

But whatever Mike D decides to pursue after Beastie Boys are no more won't be an issue for years. He sees no imminent end to the group.

"I really couldn't put a time thing on it," he says. "It's literally as long as we keep wanting to do it. I think if you had asked us 10 years ago if we would still be doing it in 10 years, we'd be like, `I have no idea.' It would almost be unforeseeable to me."

For now, they show no signs of slowing down. Because they can't/they won't/and they don't stop? It's a sure shot.

Headline: Dim Sum lunch quickly replacing sushi as the next stylish thing to eat
Author: Carlos C. Olaechea / Contributing Writer

You know that a cuisine has become mundane once you find it prepackaged in grocery stores and even gas stations. This is the case with sushi. California rolls are almost household dishes now, and almost every Asian restaurant, from Japanese to Indonesian, has a sushi bar. It has come to the point that most Americans in metropolitan areas have tried sushi at least once. Needless to say, after about a decade, trendsters and gourmets alike have been searching for a successor to the sushi craze. So far, there are three contenders:  Ceviche, tapas/mezze, and dim sum. Although the first two are slowly gaining popularity, it has come in waves; one year ceviche is popular, the next year it's tapas and mezze's turn in the limelight. Dim sum is the only one of the three that is growing steadily in popularity, and it is already well established in New York City and San Francisco. 

But what exactly is dim sum? Literally, dim sum means "to touch the heart" in Mandarin, China's official language. Dim sum, like sushi, is more than just food. It is an experience.  Traditionally a breakfast/early lunch specialty, dim sum basically consists of small portions of food, most often dumplings and filled buns, that you select from a series of trolleys that cruise around a restaurant. In Manhattan's Chinatown, most restaurants serve dim sum from about 6 or 7a.m. to no later than 3:00 p.m. However, there are some that specialize exclusively in dim sum, some serving it 24 hours a day. The charming aspect of dim sum is that it is almost like a buffet, you can savor a variety of dishes but pay only for what you eat, so you never feel compelled to eat your money's worth. 

There is also a more civilized feeling to dim sum. Unlike a buffet, the food comes to you rather than giving you more time to converse with your dining partners. Yet, the best part about the whole dim sum experience is that it lacks in the pretentiousness that so many sushi bars and Japanese restaurants are all too eager to assume.  Attitudes are left at the door, and, upon entering, you are invited to get comfortable and allow these little delicacies to "touch the heart."

Now that you know a little about dim sum, you're probably eager to know where you can get your hands on some. South Garden Chinese Restaurant II, located in Kendall, adheres to the traditional hours of dim sum and its modes of service. That is, dim sum is served Monday through Friday from 11:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The ambiance is a little classier than many Chinese restaurants, but the décor is nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary. As soon as you sit down, a trolley approaches the table and the person pushing it removes the lids from the metal steamers to reveal an enticing array of steamed dumplings and buns, each one as mysterious as the next. You pick the dim sum you want from a large, freshly made selection. Although some of the mystery can disappear upon asking the wait staff, you ultimately  discover what's good, what's mediocre, and what would be considered a bit more adventurous primarily through trial and error. The Fun Gor Special, the Siu Mai, and the stuffed sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf are all good choices. This recommendation consists of a special type of "glutinous" rice that is stuffed with chicken, pork and Chinese sausage, wrapped in a lotus leaf, and then steamed. The dumplings are usually very good, but the buns can be a bit too "bread-y" for this diner's taste. After the steamed trolley leaves, another trolley approaches.  This one brings all the sweets, but, best of all, this is the trolley where the baked pork buns are.  These are my personal favorites and are basically yeast rolls stuffed with barbecue pork, almost like a Chinese barbecue pork sandwich.

South Garden also offers desserts like egg custard, mango pudding, and custard-filled steamed buns, as well as the classic Chinese rice porridge, Congee. If you don't feel like dim sum, the restaurant also offers a superb a la carte menu offering all the usual Chinese dishes, as well as some specialties like Chinese melons and bean vermicelli with dried shrimp, a very exotic and tasty dish.  Dim sum is typically served in portions of two to four pieces, depending on their size. Prices range from about $2.25 to $9.95, but most don't cost more than three dollars. Once again, one can eat as much or as little as one wants. Every portion of dim sum that you select is marked on a card that has the names of all the items available and their respective prices. This serves as your receipt and is given to the cashier at the front of the restaurant when you pay.

Dim sum is an experience worth trying. However, will it really replace sushi as the trendy thing to eat? I don't think sushi will ever be replaced, but as more and more people begin to eat dim sum, I believe that sushi will eventually be put on the back burner of the dining population's conscience. But don't take my word for it. Go ahead and try dim sum for yourself and see what the outcome of this gastronomic battle will be.
