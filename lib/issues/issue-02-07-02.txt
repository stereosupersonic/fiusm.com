Headline: COMMENTARY: MAKING SENSE
Subheadline: A look inside the confusion of the sports world
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Some reflections on the sports world – outside of the boundaries of FIU…

There is something very unsettling about the Montreal Expos trading for high-priced Bartolo Colon, since the team is being operated by Major League Baseball. Baseball should not be operating a team and this just makes a bad situation worse. 

The reason that Commissioner Bud Selig doesn't operate the Milwaukee Brewers, the team he formerly ran, is because of the obvious conflict. This is no different than baseball owning a team and spending money to make it better. 

Montreal severely underpaid for the 29-year old ace, by sending Lee Stevens and three minor-leaguers to Cleveland. Isn't it ironic, how after years of acting as the minor league system for the rest of baseball, Montreal trading away prospects for proven veterans? 
Makes you wonder whether Larry Walker, Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez would still be north of the border if the league had owned the team back then, too.

I'm starting to wonder whether South Florida even deserves a Major League Baseball team. Not only is the low attendance becoming tiring and embarrassing, but also the empty seats during Luis Castillo's 35-game hitting streak drew national attention to the situation. For the last 10 games of the streak, some remark was made about the attendance on ESPN highlight shows. You have to wonder if anyone even cared that they had a chance to watch one of the greatest streaks in the last century.

John Burkett stating that he would boycott the All-Star game if selected, due to the labor negotiations between baseball's players and owners, is a perfect example of what is wrong with the sport. The Mid-Summer Classic was once viewed as the fan's game. Now it's a negotiating tool. 

I have no problem with players and owners wanting to make more money. The truth is that baseball is a sport – but Burkett comes off like a whining child.

Congratulations to the Bowl Championship Series. You finally did something right. 

The BCS has eliminated the margin of victory category of its formula, opening the door for top teams to receive due credit for defeating decent opponents. I never understood why a 65-point win over Baylor helped a team as much as a one point win over Oklahoma. 

It took the BCS less than five years to figure this out, so they should have it completely figured out (i.e. a playoff system) by the year 2050.

The NCAA added three more bowl games this year, bringing the total number to 28. Now fans can enjoy the Houston Bowl, the Seattle Bowl and the San Francisco Bowl. 

I'm sure all three will have dot.com sponsors by the time the season rolls around. 

Obviously, these bowls were very much needed. It wasn't enough to have to suffer through last year's New Orleans Bowl, in which featured Colorado State defeating North Texas 45-20. North Texas entered that game with a 5-6 record. 

This year might be worse. The Seattle Bowl's likely match-up includes the Mountain West Conference's No. 4 team versus the ACC's sixth best. Last year, this would have meant a game with New Mexico and Clemson.

And finally, this falls under the "It just needed to be mentioned" category: The Confederation of African Football has decided to ban witchcraft within its soccer league. This is not a joke. Officials and players have cited the fact that the league's players and management no longer believe witchcraft is necessary because of the increasing skills and abilities of its participants. It's difficult to find any way to make sense of this. It's just funny.

Headline: Dueñas catches on with Anaheim
Author: PETE PELEGRIN / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's funny sometimes how things just work themselves out.  

Former FIU catcher Tommy Dueñas is living proof of that after getting drafted by the Anaheim Angels in the 16th round of the Major League Baseball Amateur Draft on June 4th.

It seems it was written somewhere that Dueñas was going to be a catcher in the Angels' organization.

Through his personal goal setting and some eerie coincidences, Dueñas is now catching for the Mesa Angels in the Arizona Rookie League.

"Growing up as a kid, I would always look at the back of baseball cards and go 'wow!' I could be on there someday, and now I've a got a chance to do that," Dueñas said.

Dueñas got that chance through the numerous personal goals he would set for himself.  This Angel already had his head in the clouds.

"Every time I was in a different stage in my baseball career I would see a cloud, which I would call my goal," Dueñas explained.  "And once I would reach that goal, then I would clear that cloud and go on to the next.  Cloud &#8211; clear.  Cloud &#8211; clear."

Yet, like most things worthwhile, Dueñas' clouds were not the white, puffy, easy ones found in the blue sky.

Dueñas had to have an unyielding work ethic to reach his goals.  He didn't start catching full-time until his senior year in high school.

It was at Coral Gables High where he established his first goal of being the starting catcher.  

With the help of former Montreal Expos' catcher and Miami native Bobby Ramos, Dueñas honed his skills enough to become the starter for the Cavaliers. 

Cloud cleared.  Dueñas received All Miami-Dade honors his senior year.
Still, since he didn't play the  catcher position until his final year in high school, there was not- much fanfare in the way of baseball scholarship offers from the major colleges.

But that didn't prevent Dueñas from giving up on his baseball dream.  He enrolled at FIU to try and reach his next goal of "getting a uniform" and asked if he could tryout as a walk-on.  

After his first catching session at FIU, he almost became a walk-off.
"It was tough because everything was new and at a much faster pace," Dueñas recalled.  "In my first bullpen session, my glove would keep falling off when the pitchers would throw to me.  I looked like a little league catcher." 

Dueñas persevered through the rough first year and won the starting job his sophomore year.  Another goal accomplished, but it was one he had to hold onto.

"I felt too good about being the starter and Michael New gave me competition for the position," Dueñas said.  "When I got complacent it came back to bite me in the butt."

Dueñas ended up sitting on the bench, but it turned out the catching competition became a blessing in disguise.

"When I have competition I perform better," Dueñas added.
He started to work diligently with FIU pitching coach Mark Calvi on every aspect of catching from developing his arm strength to knowing how to call a game.

"One of the biggest reasons I'm here today playing pro ball is because of Mark Calvi," Dueñas said.  "He gave me my shot.  He developed me and fine tuned me into a catcher."

"[During] sophomore year, it all started coming together for Tommy," Calvi said.  "Mike New made Tommy realize that you always have to compete at your highest level."

"Plus, I think he really developed when he went away to play summer ball," Calvi added.  "He no longer had me to lean on and had to rely on himself."

Dueñas improved so much his sophomore year that he had major league scouts talking to him before his junior season, his last at FIU.  

The Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau compares Dueñas' defensive skills and body type to Texas Rangers catcher Ivan "Pudge" Rodriguez.
"The scouts told me before the season that they liked my defense, but they wanted to see if I could hit," Dueñas said.  "Well, I think my numbers showed them."

After leading the team in hitting with a .387 average, finishing second in home runs with 12 and third in RBI with 57, it was clear skies for Dueñas.

The next cloud to clear was getting drafted, but the way the draft started to shake out, it looked like it was going to rain on Dueñas' parade.
Like a kid with a new PlayStation game, Dueñas was fixated to his computer monitor on draft day watching and listening attentively to Major League Baseball Radio Live waiting for his name to come across the screen.  Except this was not a game he was playing with, but rather his future.

He expected to get a call anywhere between the 6th and 12th rounds, but the phone was silent.

After the 12th round, he stepped away from the computer to wonder why he wasn't drafted.

Finally in the 15th round the San Francisco Giants called and asked Dueñas if he still wanted to play.  He was speechless.  The Giants told him they needed a quick decision and would call back soon for his answer.  

But when Dueñas hung up the phone, his friend, FIU outfielder Hector Nunez called with some relieving news.

"I get Hector on the other line and he tells me congratulations you just got drafted by the Angels," Dueñas exuberantly said.  "I thought he was joking, but he said look at the screen and there was my name with the Angels logo next to it."

Now, Dueñas' life was changing quickly.

"Right after I got drafted I started thinking I've come to a dead end in my life," Dueñas thought.  "I either go left or right, stay or sign.  This decision was going to change my life, but I was ready to move on so just one week later I signed."

Dueñas has been playing minor league baseball for three weeks and he has to continually adapt from the college game.

"I'm facing a number one pitcher everyday with a wood bat, and my God, is using a wood bat an adjustment," Dueñas added.  

"Over here you have to take care of yourself on and off the field, because what you do off the field shows what you do on the field."

"This is a total change you; just have to grow up out here," Dueñas said.  
"You're getting paid to play baseball.  It's my life.  It's my job."

Dueñas' next cloud is a much loftier one.

"Right now I'm the eighth string catcher in the Angels organization," Dueñas said.  "I have my sights set on Bengie Molina (Anaheim Angels starting catcher) and Edison International Field."

Which brings us back to the notion of Dueñas being preordained to be a catcher and to catch in the Angels organization.

Ramos, who gave Dueñas the catching lessons in high school, is now the Anaheim Angels bullpen coach.  

Calvi, the man Dueñas credits with making him the catcher that he is, is a "pitching" coach, but not too many pitching coaches are former minor league catchers.  Calvi caught in the Seattle Mariners organization in 1992.

The Giants were ready to draft Dueñas, but with Dueñas' hesitation he fell to the Angels.

Duenas' current manager, Brian Harper, is a former major league catcher.

The Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia is also a former big league catcher.

Dueñas was assigned uniform number 14.  Scioscia's number was also 14.

"It's amazing how everything fell perfectly into place," Dueñas said.  

"Ramos, Calvi, getting drafted by the Angels and the managers in this organization are all catchers."  

"I'm a guy who came out of nowhere and battled to get to where I am today, but with the weird way things worked out it makes you wonder if there's someone up there pulling some strings."

Headline: The Graham Center's Face Lift
Subheadline: Building's expansion to take three years
Author: Azra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Over the next two to three years, University Park's Graham Center will be undergoing a series of renovations to accommodate the students' wants and needs. 

The $5 million in funding for the GC renovation excluding the bookstore comes from two sources, University Business Services Director Alex Zyne said. Half will be paid by what is known as the Capital Improvement Fund. The other half will come from the University Auxiliary. 

Expansions of the first and second floors will happen in a northern and western direction. 

On the first floor, existing services and businesses such as the computer lab, ID card office and the Ticketmaster window will all be expanded, as will the sitting areas.

Santi's International Salon, currently located next to the Office of Disability Services, is expected to relocate to an area near the building's west wall. In addition to what will be a new and bigger salon, either an office or a Mailbox Etc. might be placed in this new area. 

In place of the old Santi's will either be a gift shop, a flower shop, a store selling cellular phones, or all three, Hamilton said. Plans for the new Santi's area as well as what will replace it are still tentative and cannot currently be confirmed.

Because of the expansion of the second floor, many student organizations on the third floor will move down one floor where they will have a little more breathing room. Some of the organizations include the Volunteer Action Center, the Student Government Association, some Greek organizations, the Graduate Student Association and the Center for Leadership. 

 "Students asked for a more visible space and place to program events such as Greek Week, International Week and Women's History Month," Hamilton said.

Many of these changes were originally suggestions students made in surveys they took over the past few years, Hamilton said.

"We always try to take an objective look at what we're doing and figure out how to make it even better," she said.

Currently, the third floor has no plans to expand any time soon. 
All of these changes, expected to be completed by December 2003 or early 2004, will cause few inconveniences to FIU students and employees. 

 "Because we're phasing, not just rearranging the current building, students will be able to access everything the GC currently has to offer with virtually no hassle due to renovations," Hamilton said. 

One location at the GC whose eye-catching renovations have already been completed is the University Bookstore. 

Among the changes at this establishment are the extension of the first floor and a fully functional Starbucks coffee on the second floor. Previously, the store was only one story high.  

Bookstore General Manager Jim Brogan, stressed that Barnes and Noble, the company FIU chose to sell books, continues to operate the book sales. Seventy-five percent of the funding for the bookstore's renovations came from Barnes and Noble. The store's revenues paid the other twenty-five percent.

Brogan said tables and 120 chairs were placed on the second floor to accomodate the new Starbucks. 

Sine the renovation, the store has tripled the size of its general reading area and has added a large magazine rack. Previously, the Panther Stop, just next to the bookstore, was the only on-campus location with a magazine rack. 

Because of the bookstore's expansion, the number of available textbooks will increase by 25 percent, Brogan said. 

Set on one side of the updated store is a "neolibrary." Features of this section, designed first and foremost for students to relax in, include a 61-inch interactive plasma screen television constantly playing music videos and movie previews, plus sofas for students to unwind in. 
A grand opening party for the refurbished bookstore will take place during the third week of November.

At least for the next few months, the most prominent changes to the GC will be in the dining area. 

"We don't want to call it a cafeteria anymore," Food Services Marketing Manager Manuel Rivera said. "We want to call it a restaurant."

Rivera and Pepe Garcia, the Food Services director, have begun doing this in a few ways. While the current food court, housing Pollo Tropical and Subway will remain as-is, the restaurants inside the cafeteria, including Burger King, will all be moved to a new location. 

Replacing the former home of these restaurants will be five buffet-style restaurants all run by the Fresh Food Company: the Fresh Produce Market, the Mediterranean Kitchen, Island Cuisine, the Southern Kitchen and American Bistro.

The fresh produce market will provide a wide assortment of ingredients for vegetarians, the Mediterranean Kitchen will serve pastas, casseroles and flat bread, Island Cuisine will serve both Latin and Caribbean foods, the Southern Kitchen will provide "traditional American home cooking" and the American bistro will serve specialty sandwiches and specialty breads. Each of these restaurants will be available in an all-you-can-eat fashion. 

There will be a separate station for drinks. In addition to the soft drinks, milk, orange juice and a waffle station will also be available. 

Students who intend to eat on campus can pay in one of two ways: They can either buy their meal at the time they intend to eat or they can enroll in one of three meal plans the school has to offer. 

To give students an incentive to purchase a meal plan, Garcia and Rivera have decided to enter the first 200 students who purchase a meal plan in a contest where they will have a chance to win a television, a DVD player or a mountain bike. 

The extension of the seating area will allow 425 students to eat in the cafeteria, an increase of 100 students from the current 325.
Aramark, a national managing company, will fund the entire meal plan. The only money FIU as a school will contribute will be for the cafeteria furniture.

The cafeteria's hours of operation will also be expanded after the remodeling. It will open at 7 a.m. and close at 9 p.m. seven days a week with non-stop service. 

Ceiling lights will be added and the floor tiles will be changed. Also, carpeting will be installed in certain areas.

In addition to regular chairs, high chairs will be added to create some choice for students who want to eat there. 

New china and silverware will replace the styrofoam plates and paper cups diners presently use and all cafeteria staff will wear brand new uniforms. 

A second convenience store, this one endorsed by FIU, will open up in the residential area. Located there will be a deli, pizza shop, Java City, and drink station. Frozen foods, beauty supplies and gondolas featuring other foods will also be there. 

Rivera considers this store "a little supermarket just for [residential students]."

Subheadline: Architecture school rejects prospective students from program
Author: Katia Fuminaya / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When choosing the design for the new School of Architecture building the candidates had to make presentations, turn in design proposals and finally go before a jury. 

Students saw how professional architects showcased their architectural work. Architects presented previous work and discussed areas of interest. Out of seven presenters, the final jury selected Bernard Tschumi Architects/ Bruno-Elias et Associates Inc. The jury looked for strong emphasis in the need for "spatial flexibility" in the building design. And that was exactly what the architects showcased.

In the end, an innovative, eye catching design was finally chosen.
Now, students in the program must face a similar situation with nothing less than their future at stake.

Students also had to submit a portfolio in order to get accepted into the School of Architecture and advance in the program. 

The school offers programs in Landscape Architecture, Interior Design and Architectural Studies.

To get accredited, the new school is required to meet space requirements. Plentiful space allocation is emphasized to establish an improved student-faculty relationship. Most of the coursework is taught and done in studio-like classrooms. Independent workstations for each student gives them the space needed for group review and discussions. These stations are designed to fit computers linked to zoning, space and building programs.

"Studio space isn't like a classroom. It's a 24 hour dedicated space. The average student spends hours on their coursework," David Bergwall, director of administration explained. 

Interestingly, the lack of space is exactly why it was so competitive for students to get in the school. About 40 out of 120 applicants were rejected. 

Bergwall said the school has about 375 students. Most of them are at the undergraduate level (300), while the remainder (75) are at the graduate level. Students had to meet certain criteria to get accepted.

There are eight design levels equivalent to eight semesters taken in sequence. Design 1-4 are considered pre-architectural studies.

Passing through Design 5's "gate" exposes students to more AutoCAD work. Then it's acoustics, visualization and finally 3D work, Bergwall said. But how does a student get past this gate? 

The acceptance process for the fall semester was based on CLAST scores; completion of Design 1-4 with a grade of a "C" or above and an overall GPA of 2.5 or above. The most recent addition to the catalog is a completion of 60 credit hours. Above all, students had to submit a portfolio showcasing their work.

Once the portfolios were submitted, five faculty members reviewed each portfolio independently. The criterion for the judging was based on graphic ability, design and a written statement. The scores were added and averaged. Those who were accepted into the program got an acceptance letter and those who did not may have gotten a rejection letter.

According to two architecture students whose names are being held for fear of reprisal, the school's acceptance policies were unfair, uninformative and biased. 

The first student, a junior majoring in Interior Design said she was told she was not accepted after talking to others in the program who were accepted.

 "I had to call to find out if I was accepted," she said. "Two weeks later I got a rejection letter."

She also believes the acceptance process was messy. 

"The whole portfolio thing was not in the course catalog," she said, "and if it was, it has not been enforced in the years I've been in the program."
The student, who has a 2.8 GPA, submitted her portfolio based on all the learned coursework she has acquired thus far. 

"I've turned in projects and gotten good grades for them," she said. "If teachers have graded my works good and I've got the GPA why wouldn't my portfolio be good enough?"

Bergwall said everyone was ranked from top to bottom. He also said the criterion for grading the portfolio is all stated in the catalog with the exception of the 60 credit hours completion.

The second student, a senior majoring in Interior Design has 11 classes left to graduate but cannot advance any further, at least not untill next year. 

Because the program is to be completed in a sequence, Designs 5 and 7 are offered in the fall while Designs 6 and 8 are offered in the spring. This puts anyone who did not make it to Design 5 a year behind. 

"People got cut based on the goodness [sic] of their portfolios, but no one told us of the portfolio before," he said. "No instructions, no catalog, no workshops."

Graduate Programs Director Marta Canavés was one of the five faculty members to review the portfolios. 

"These reviews are good for students to know how to project themselves into moving on and getting recruited out there," Marta Canavés said.

The deadline to submit the portfolio may have been somewhat inopportune. Students were told of the deadline date with little anticipation &#8211; a month. As if that was not pressuring enough, the portfolio was to be turned in during finals week.

The female student, who has 85 credits in the program leaving her only five credits away from being a senior, will have to take up one of the three options suggested by the school &#8211; apply again next year, register for other School of Architecture courses other than design studio courses, or consider whether a design major in the School of Architecture is correct for the student. 

"The number of students rejected has been low, but we're also raising standards," Bergwall said.

These methods and standards are common in schools of architecture.
"FAU [Florida Atlantic University] does it," Bergwall said. "It's nothing new in the field. Some dreams get crushed and we're concerned."

When asked how well the school prepared students for review, Bergwall said workshops were offered and there are plans to teach more courses in the summer.

Associate Dean and Research Director Jaime Canavés, who has taught architecture classes for 22 years, taught one of those workshops. He said that although the workshops were offered late in the semester and the school had not implemented the portfolio review in his teaching years, the school had no choice. 

"[The review] had to be done this way," Jaime Canavés said. "It was the best solution to meet our capacity requirements."

Canavés and other professors encourage students to prepare portfolios for future employment or higher education.	

"It's a gateway to filter out students who we felt haven't accomplished as high as they should have," he said.

As far as the fairness of getting good grades in class and a non-passing grade for a portfolio, Casanavés explains the need for "drive."

"I don't think a student can get a good grade in class and then not do well on his or her portfolio. A passing grade is good but there are other students who get better grades and are driven to put more effort into their portfolios," he said.

Headline: "Minority Report" generates real thrills
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
Bold statement: "Minority Report" is Steven Spielberg's best movie since "Schindler's List," and unlike "Saving Private Ryan" it doesn't shoot its cinematic load within the first twenty minutes because as far as movies go, "Minority Report" is a certified stud. It's only toward the very end that it even begins to show signs of weariness. 

It's the year 2054, and Detective John Anderton (a cool-as-usual Tom Cruise) heads the Department of Pre-crime, tracking murderers before they're able to actually commit their murders. The advance warnings of three mysterious creatures, the Pre-Cogs, that anticipate acts of brutality through highly stylized dreams.

 It's all fine and dandy and the system works, until John Anderton finds himself crushed under the weight of his own devices, accused by the Pre-cogs of a crime he has no intention of committing at all in the first place.

Of course, this being a summer movie, he must run from Pre-Crime, but it's an exhilarating run that still manages to tell us more about America in 2054 than most other movies tell us about America in 2002. 

The concept is very loosely based on Philip K. Dick's novella of the same title – about as loosely as soy burgers are based on actual meat. But the story is all Spielberg, dashes of darkness against a sentimental canvas of Americana.

 Hold on to that word "sentimental," because it's bound to pop up in every review you'll ever read about this movie. I'll argue  that sentimental should only be used pejoratively when it concerns those artificial feelings Hollywood tries to wring out of us with patented tear-jerkomatics: "Kill the cute little kid," "give the young girl with cancer," "throw in a tragic car accident to spice things up." Steven Spielberg is sentimental, sure, but you never doubt he's also sincere. He's an old softy, but a magnificent one.

What does amount to a flaw is the movie's over-blown ending. Or should I say endings? They come one after the other, emotionally satisfying conclusion followed by intellectually satisfying conclusion followed by viscerally satisfying conclusion followed by… you get the idea. 

At the end, all those thrilling plot twists have straightened each other out, and we have a movie that has explained away a lot of its fun. 

Flawed and all, sci-fi movies this intelligent and clear-eyed don't drop our way often.

Headline: Norah Jones jazzes things up
Author: Claudia Ortega
&nbsp;
In an industry dominated by image, shallow lyrics and artificial talent, singer and pianist Norah Jones has emerged as one of those rare exceptions to the norm. And if the buzz surrounding her debut album proves true, she might soon be following the footsteps to fame of other female soul searchers like Tori Amos and Alicia Keys.  

Unlike these popular predecessors however, Jones' style is refreshingly unusual and unique. Her first album, Come Away with Me, fuses elements of folk and blues along with traditional jazz. However, don't be misled by this, or by the label on which she is signed (Blue Note) you won't find her album in the jazz section. Rather, in their infinite wisdom, the music stores have tucked her albums away in that ever-expanding, un-definable repository of "miscellaneous" music, the rock and pop section.

Born in New York City, Jones moved to a Dallas suburb when she was 4 and began singing a year later in local church choirs. Her mother, in an effort to encourage her daughter's musicality, began paying for piano lessons when Jones was seven. 

It paid off as music became Jones' passion, and at 15 she enrolled in Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, the same school from which trumpeter Roy Hargrove and singer Erykah Badu graduated. She entered the University of North Texas, which boasts a renowned music program, after graduation and decided to study jazz piano – something she felt would give her a more solid foundation – instead of singing.

The summer after her sophomore year found her in New York City for a short vacation. Like so many artists before her, she realized she didn't want to leave and ended up moving there. 

Taking up the staple job for a young, starving artist – waitressing – Jones spent her evenings singing and playing in noisy jazz clubs where, she discovered, no one really went to hear jazz. It wasn't until she played a gig at The Living Room that she found an appreciative and silent audience. The haunt for local songwriters, she was influenced to begin exploring writing as another means of expression and eventually hooked up with guitarist/songwriter Jesse Harris, and bassist (boyfriend) Lee Alexander.

A friend took Jones to the prestigious jazz label Blue Note Records, whose open-door policy proved beneficial to her; although she had already sung in a few bands and was beginning to establish a fan base, she was still relatively unknown in the New York area. In October 2000, Jones, along with Harris, Alexander, and drummer Dan Reiser, recorded some demos for Blue Note; as Jones' reputation grew, these recordings were formed into an EP dubbed First Sessions in order to give fans something to listen to before her first full-length album came out. 

Having learned their lesson when they failed to sign Eva Cassidy on account of her not being "real" jazz, Blue Note jumped at the opportunity to sign Jones, whose sultry voice they admit is definitely "jazz influenced." So in January 2001, Blue Note officially welcomed Jones and her band.  

Jones, who received her exotic looks – and probably her ear for music as well – from her absentee father, Ravi Shankar, is exploring her style, voice, and ability for songwriting in Come Away with Me.  Her strength – her voice – is the focus of the album, and what really carries it along.  A few more instrumental solos, from both Jones and the other musicians on the album, might have given it more depth; likewise, the lyrics, while charming and sweet, don't offer any particularly memorable lines or surprising bits of wisdom.  

It is however, her first album and they show a great potential for growth in all these areas.  Jones herself has often pointed out that her main goal is to improve her songwriting skills and put out a second album with more of her original work. Luckily for her, her voice is enough to set her apart from the other musicians out today. Part Patsy Cline, part Nina Simone, with a sleepy, jazzy feel that's at once soothing and intoxicating, it will never be confused with any fellow singers.

Even though she's received rave reviews don't expect to see her blow up into a mega-pop-star any time soon. Jones retains all the control over her music and her style, and will often flat-out refuse suggestions such as doing publicity – like talk shows – before a concert (she adamantly states that it wears her out and doesn't allow her to perform well).

 Equally as unlikely is a crossover into pop music.  Jones, whose influences include Billie Holiday and Willie Nelson, prefers the music of yesterday. As she says in her website: "Old music is just so badass and original. So much of today's music sounds cheesy to me." However, she's not entirely opposed to modern music: "I do put on Nirvana occasionally."

Headline: Eminem continues to shock
Author: Jay Santiago
&nbsp;
"Guess who's back/back again/Shady's back." So begins "Without Me," the latest single from the mind of Eminem, who makes his return with the release of his third solo album, The Eminem Show, the follow-up to the rapper's controversial Grammy-nominated Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem, who also helped produce the album, went to great lengths to make sure that The Eminem Show would not succumb to the internet piracy that has been plaguing the industry. Several major critics who wanted to listen to the album were not given a copy; instead they met at an undisclosed location for a listening session.

Despite all efforts, the album was online three weeks prior to the original June 4 release date, and was subsequently pushed forward.  As an incentive to buy the CD, the first two million copies will feature a bonus DVD that will include interviews, behind the scenes footage, and a trailer to his upcoming movie, "8 Mile," which will open in theatres nationwide in November.  

The album is in essence a self-examination of the rapper's life thus far that shows a personal side to Eminem not seen before.  Gone are the lyrics about homosexuals, 'N Sync, and women.  In their place,  Eminem spits lyrics about family, legal troubles and his unique views on society.   

As "Curtains Rise," Eminem clears his throat and thrusts the listener into his world with the second track "White America." With similarities to "Kill You" from the Marshall Mathers LP, "White America," fuses rap and rock in a extraordinary tone that rants about politics and society, urging listeners to pay attention to the lyrics only to say: "I'm just playing America, you know I love you." 

"Cleaning out My Closet," arguably Eminem's most personal song, does just that, revealing his difficult upbringing with his missing father and drug-abusing mom.  "Say Goodbye Hollywood" puts Eminem on display, showing his fears about life while at the same time raising questions about his fans and career. The track poses the question: Is fame worth it?

"Without Me," the first single from the album, fails to deliver. It is a radio friendly song designed to grab MTV's attention and consumer dollars. The song is a far cry from the rest of the album, which showcases a mature Eminem who has moved on beyond the disses, but not the controversy. 

"Say What You Say" is a collaboration with Dr. Dre. The chemistry between the two is fantastic, and it establishes their place in the music industry.  In an uncharacteristic move, Eminem sampled Aerosmith's 1973 classic "Dream On" for a beautiful ballad entitled "Sing For the Moment." The song replies to his political critics and poses a glimmer of hope for those caught in tough situations.  "That's why we rap for these kids who don't have a thing but a dream," he adamantly declares. 

In "Hallie's song," Em "just wants to sing" as an ode to his daughter, and actually does. It is definitely one of the best tracks on the album, showing how a sincere Eminem feels about his daughter, Hallie, whom "he loves more than life itself." 

"Till I Collapse" revels in undertones of perseverance and respect with a brilliant chorus performed by Nate Dogg.  The album also features unfortunate appearances by D-12 and Obi Trice that detracts from the overall effect of the album. The Eminem Show comes to an end with the last track "Curtains Close."   

Despite all the controversy, bootlegging, and pop shots, it can't be ignored that Eminem has grown as an artist. This album is a step forward. The title itself says a great deal about Eminem and his album; his life is in essence a show to the world. The album blends rap and rock beautifully with wonderful beats that at times will mellow you, while at others  have you screaming. 

With a different sound and style, The Eminem Show is a great listen with real flavor. Ultimately, Eminem's genius stems from his total honesty in telling a story, something not only rap, but music in general has rarely done since MTV's inception.

Headline: In Our View:  Architecture students deserve more time to adjust to new policy
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
For the first time in at least 22 years, FIU's School of Architecture has decided to invoke a little known edict in its student catalog. In order for a student to be admitted into the program, they must complete and excel in the CLAST exam, complete four design courses with at least a C, and have an overall grade point average of a 2.5.

Why has the school decided to enforce this rule and enrage at least two of its students? One word: Accreditation.

One of the things the school must change is the number of students in its classes. As a result, fewer students are being allowed to take design courses.

Already students who  wanted to take Design 5 in the fall semester had to apply for the course. Out of the 120 that applied, 40 were rejected.

The school's director of administration, David Bergwall, said students were selected from the top down – that is, the best got in and the students lacking in some of the criteria did not.

Some of these students blame the school's poor timing for their inability to surpass their classmates and enter Design 5. They claim to have had only a month to prepare a portfolio which was due during finals week.

Those who did not make itcan apply the following year for the class, but no guarantees are being given. 

That means students cannot take design courses, which are needed for graduaton, until the year has elapsed and the school offers the course again.

Although the school did offer workshops on how to create a portfolio, at the very least, the School of Architecture and its administration should have given students more than a month to prepare something so important that it will help decide their future.

Taking all this into account, the school should have waited at least another semester to impose this rule on its students. More time should have been dedicated towards informing the students of the severity of the situation. 

Finally, more time should also have been dedicated toward setting up the system by which students were informed of the school's decision.

Headline: Letter to the editor: Column full of usual liberal rhetoric
Author: Andrew Mallo
&nbsp;
To the editor:

You just have to love the tactics of the political left. The article in the June 18, 2002 issue of The Beacon regarding how helpless Cubans are so stupid that they are "brainwashed" by Conservatism is typical. 

The author of this column fails to realize that Cubans leave Cuba to escape Communism, not to transfer to another form of Communism (liberalism). Cubans leave their homeland so that they and their children can empower themselves to realize their dreams, not to have Big Government tell them what they should and should not do. 

But there is consistency here, folks. We see this kind of liberal pandering to all cultures in the United States. The first thing that liberals do is label immirants as "minorities" so that they can be looked upon as helpless by white American males of European descent. The intentions of the writer of the last article is to clearly divide people for political gain. Liberals for over 50 years have been doing this. 

They promise to fix education by throwing money at the problem to show they "care" for symbolic reasons so that they can get your vote. 

This is another reason why liberalism is at its deathbed in America and is beginning to die worldwide. As long as there exists a group of weak-minded individuals who can be duped into believing they cannot do things for themselves and who need the all-caring, all-loving liberals to take care of them, we will see more and more welfare recipients and less educated people who empower themselves to realize what they can do on their own. Liberals do not want true equality. If everyone was treated equally in America, and if everyone believed that their failures in life are not due to where they came from but what they did not succeed in, liberalism would be completely dead. 

I just hope that more people realize that articles like this contribute to what liberalism seeks to achieve: pessimism, dependency and hopelessness.

Headline: Columnist reveals seven stages of student apathy
Author: Jorge Montes
&nbsp;
I was sitting at my keyboard, staring at the monitor as the clock ticked on by. My class would begin in four and a half hours. The sun would start rising soon. And I still had absolutely nothing written for my essay.

Where had my time gone? The answer is simple: I succumbed to the seven stages of student apathy. I discovered these seven stages once while writing an essay my freshman year. There's nothing you can do either. Once you're stuck in the stages, you have to go through them all.

Stage 1: Complaining – The earliest stage of student apathy. You curse about the essay to anyone you can talk to, be it your mom, your best friend on the phone, that girl who is always e-mailing you surveys, or even people in a completely random chatroom. The idea is to gain sympathy as you pathetically stall.

Stage 2: Trivial Pursuit – Quotes from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" on IMDB. The latest local soccer scores in Dublin. You're on a binge, the search for useless information. It starts harmlessly enough:  "Gee, I wonder if there's any info on fark.com that can help me with my essay," but before you know it, two hours have passed and you're knee-deep in urban legend explanations. (Note: For non-computer geeks, the alternative to Stage 2 is watching television or doing anything, other than the essay.)

Stage 3: Alternative Topic – This stage of essay apathy comes from the "sudden realization" that you have no idea what you want to write about in your essay. 

In reality, you've just been too lazy to bother thinking about the topic. Nevertheless, this panic often has you looking at alternative essay topics, hoping for something easier that will get your creative juices flowing. If you do actually change your topic, expect to start back at stage one again.

Stage 4: Professorial Pleasantries – Actually, the comments you make in this stage are anything but "pleasantries." Basically, this is a slight reversion to stage one "complaining," with the only difference being that the target is almost always the abilities or intelligence of the professor who gave you the assignment. 

On rare occasion, the class itself may get attacked (for being pointless, unnecessary, etc) but usually Teach gets the shaft.

Stage 5: "I'll Get To That Later." – Sound familiar? This is the cry of someone in Stage 5. This stage is the first attempt to write or do actual research. 

Usually, you'll open whatever word processor on your computer and just start stringing together words based loosely on ideas you'll want to touch on later. Understand this stage has no writing. 

All ideas are compressed into simple terms like "theme," "blue" and "body language," which you will supposedly go back to later and elaborate on for a paragraph or two. But for the time being, you just want to move on to something else more important. You won't see that topic again for at least a few hours.

Stage 6: Sleeping sickness – "Man, I'm so tired. I think I'm going to finish writing this and just crash;" or "Oh wow, my eyes are fluttering in sleep deprivation. I think I'll just finish this page and write the rest really early tomorrow." This stage usually starts with comments like these and ends with: "Damn! It's 1:30 p.m.! I overslept!"

Stage 7: Self-Pavlov – I use this term because, like clockwork, you've finally started writing. Slowly, but hey, at least you've got some paragraphs on the page. 

But how to make yourself continue writing? That's easy. Rewards. You leave your Internet running in the background, downloading some massive files, such as a long-version of a song or a game demo or some  video of your favorite  television show. 

Then, you refuse to look at that program to see how close you are to being done getting it until you're done with the essay.

Great. Now I only have two hours until my class begins. Stupid class.

Oh no. I'm in stage four. I'll never get done now.

Headline: Pledge of Allegiance protests waste taxpayer money, time
Author: David Pulgar
&nbsp;
Considering the vast majority of problems plaguing this nation it still amazes me how people can waste money on minutiae. Never would I have guessed the addition of "under God" to our Pledge of Allegiance in 1954 would stir such a commotion. 

Could there be people in the United States who have the time to root out an "injustice" no one cares about? 

Sure, maybe we have some politicians or religious activists who might be annoyed by the line, but how will changing the way we recite our Pledge help feed homeless people or provide a solution to our ailing social security system? 

The battle started in the ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will undoubtedly cost us many tax dollars as it winds itself through the system. Even though Congress' 1954 mandate was overturned, the case still has the possibility of being heard by a higher court.  

Regardless of faith or religious standing I think this whole fiasco is a sham and a waste of our time and resources. The ordeal was triggered by the daughter of Michael Newdow as she returned from school to inform her father that the word "God" was somewhere in the Pledge of Allegiance.

"I brought this case because I am an atheist and this offends me, and I have the right to bring up my daughter without God being imposed into her life by her schoolteachers," said Newdow in an interview with CNN. 

I'm not exactly sure how the reciting of the Pledge, which Newdow obviously is not familiar with since he did not notice it before, is imposing a religious belief on his daughter.  This is ridiculous when you consider she has the right not to recite it.

An issue like this should be dealt on a school level by giving students the choice not to recite the Pledge instead of wasting the time of our judicial branch. 

Now that we can't recite our own Pledge of Allegiance in certain schools, what's next? Are you going to remove the United States flag from a class because it contains 50 stars, a symbol contained in the Wiccan faith? 

Oh, and what should we do with all our money? It's all labeled with those indelible words, "In God We Trust." All of the sudden such a simple issue becomes more complex. 

The fact of the matter is, we live in a generally free society, and no one is going to ostracize you just because you don't recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Many children don't even know what it stands for and just mumble right through it. 

My quarrel isn't whether those words in our Pledge – my quarrel is with the egregious waste of resources that goes with making such a needless change. In a recent Newsweek poll, 87 percent of those surveyed said they did not want "under God" removed from the pledge. 

And what did Newdow have to say about the lawsuit? "It's a cool thing to do. Everyone should try it," he stated in the CNN interview. It's great that he thinks spending or money and tying up our system on a ridiculous debate are cool things to do.  

I wonder if he's planning on paying for the state and federal defense costs too? Or the court costs perhaps? Oh no, that's right, we are.
