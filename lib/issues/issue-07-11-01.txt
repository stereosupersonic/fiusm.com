Headline: TALKING SAFETY: Students, panel to discuss preventive measures
Author: Catherine Kaiman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Ashley Clayton, FIU graduate student and alumna of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, will speak about her experiences with the April 16 Virginia Tech shootings at a forum at the Biscayne Bay Campus Nov. 1. 

The shootings, where Seung-Hui Cho opened fire on the campus, left 32 students and faculty members dead.

In response, the Division of Student Affairs is sponsoring the forum to ensure FIU provides its students with adequate mental health services, campus security and a safer environment, according to Cathy Akens, assistant vice president of Student Affairs.

A panel of FIU professors and Bill King, Public Safety Police Chief, will be present to not only discuss the three main issues but also allow faculty members and students to pose their own questions.

This is the first time that FIU will be having a University-wide forum about campus safety, according to Akens.

"There is a lot we are doing as a University to be prepared to respond to mental health issues, but because we are such a large University, people are not aware of policies and procedures, and having a dialogue allows members of the community to learn," Akens said. "The report of the findings of the Virginia Tech shootings prompted the Division of Student Affairs to look at FIU's overall safety."

This report came out months after the Virginia Tech shootings and suggests universities and colleges should examine their public safety departments, mental health facilities and communication systems.

"I think the incident at Virginia Tech and others around the nation have reminded us, as institutions, to provide a safe educational environment and as part of that there are always ways to improve our communication with students and to respond to mental health needs of students on campus," Akens said. 

Heidi Von Harscher, associate director of Counseling and Psychological Services and a BBC panel member, is looking forward to the dialogue.

"I hope that people start to realize that this is a community issue and the more we dialogue, the more we can be aware," Von Harscher said.

Akens agrees with Von Harscher.

"All members of the University need to see campus safety as a priority, in different departments, and all members of the University community who interact with students should be aware of the resources that are available for students," Akens said.

Marian Dumaine, a coordinator in the School of Social Work, also believes that these forums  are a great way for the University to come together and become more involved with campus security.

There are already some changes being discussed such as a phone system in multiple classrooms and a text messaging system where students are informed of emergencies from FIU administrators or the Public Safety department. 

"What we are looking at in terms of a University-wide communication system is for students to be alerted when there is an emergency, funding for ways to engage the campus in awareness and also make people aware of what to do and who they can call," said Cheryl Nowell, director of Counseling and Psychological Services.

Nowell and Von Harscher agree on the importance of keeping the campus safe while respecting the privacy rights of individuals with mental health issues.

"I think it is important to educate ourselves about the different laws and rules about privacy and to find the middle ground between vigilance and awareness," Von Harscher said. 

This forum has been advertised to faculty and staff and students are encouraged to attend. 

"We need to hear from students who have safety concerns regarding the dorms and ask questions because if we do not hear from students, we will not know what's going on and it's hard to take action. We need to feel the pulse of the student body," said Philip J. Lazarus, a professor from the College of Education and BBC panel member.

The forum will be held at BBC's Wolfe University Center, room 157, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Headline: Upcoming Flix: November brings together
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Following a month that was filled with everything from big budget horror flicks to star studded thrillers to slap stick comedies, November is going to feature more of the same but with studios trying to pick up award attention, the quality of the films is bound to improve.



American Gangster (Nov. 2):
The best example of the studios trying to gear up for award season is this true life crime drama starring Denzel Washington as a self made king of the streets during Harlem in the 1970s, and Russell Crowe as the cop who works to bring him down. 

With two of the best actors in Hollywood starring, this is a movie that is sure to get a lot of attention from award voters with a story that promises to leave plenty of room for action as well as for Washington and Crowe to flex their considerable acting chops; it will likely make a large impact in the box office.

Along with Washington and Crowe, the film stars Academy Award winner Cuba Gooding Jr. and is directed by Ridley Scott, who won an Academy Award for Gladiator.



Bee Movie (Nov. 2):
Anyone who has watched NBC for more than five minutes in the past month has likely been exposed to some sort of promotion for this animated Jerry Seinfeld vehicle about the secret lives of bees. 

Seinfeld stars as a disillusioned young bee named Barry Bee Benson, who leaves the hive and the future of working in the honey industry to explore the world and find himself. Along his way, he meets a mosquito named Mooseblood (voiced by Chris Rock) and a human played by Renee Zelweger. 

Once out in the world, Benson realizes that the humans actually steal all of the bees's honey, so he sues them and wins back all of the honey for his kind. Unfortunately, this litigious act upsets a balance that threatens not only the future of bees, but humanity as well. From the same studio that created Shrek, Bee Movie is looking to strike the same balance that the Shrek series did with adult and juvenile humor. 




Lions For Lambs (Nov. 9):
With a trailer that features vague references to the war on terror and an unnamed enemy, Lions for Lambs has left many audiences justifiably confused, wondering, among other things, who the "enemy" is and whether the movie has anything resembling a plot.

As it turns out the unnamed enemy of the plot is the Taliban of Afghanistan, and the plot involves a pair of idealistic college students who join the fight in Afghanistan and the effects of a new policy that a presidential candidate (Tom Cruise) is hoping to implement. Meryl Streep plays a TV news reporter who is given the opportunity to pick up the scoop. 

While previous movies centering on the recent war on terror have struggled at the box office. Lions for Lambs can find the right mix of reality and fiction and draw in crowds looking for a story behind the news. 



Beowulf (Nov. 16):
Based on the epic English poem of the same name, Beowulf is mythical action movie where the eponymous hero must do battle with the epic demon Grendel and his mother.

Making use of an advanced form of motion capture, the film will be one of the first to use a digitally enhanced live action style, allowing the director to immerse his characters in a world that would be otherwise impossible to create. 

A strong cast featuring Angelina Jolie, Crispin Glover and Anthony Hopkins drive the film to its climactic battle with Beowulf and Grendel's mother. 



I'm Not There (Nov. 21):
Based on the life of one of the most influential voices in rock and roll, Bob Dylan, this film attempts to change views about what a biopic should be, starring numerous actors, from Heath Ledger to Christian Bale, all representing the poet at various stages of his life and career.

The unorthodox approach to telling the story is sure to provide the film some freshness. From Dylan's beginnings as a folk hero in Greenwich village to his status today as an elder statesman of rock, I'm Not There attempts to capture his story through his music and words.

This film also promises the strongest soundtrack of any upcoming releases featuring reconstructions of Dylan's songs by Indie rockers such as Sonic Youth.

Headline: Degree Decisions...a career column: Philosophy track can lead to Law School
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Plato said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." FIU philosophy majors have dedicated their college years to examining not only their own lives but also the nature of the physical and metaphysical worlds around them. 

They've grappled with logic, ethics, epistemology, and aesthetics, having their minds stretched in countless different directions. Along the way, no doubt they've grown weary of hearing that clich&eacute; question from concerned family members: "What are you going to do with that degree?"

Such relatives, and even the students themselves, may be surprised to learn that many opportunities await philosophy majors after they've received that diploma. 

One of the most common paths for Philosophy majors to take is one that leads to law school, a more frequented path than graduate school for Philosophy itself. 

Dr. Kenneth Henley, professor of philosophy, explains why a career in law is such a fitting choice for these students. 

"They are always at the top or near the top on the LSAT," Henley said. "It's because of their attention to rigor, logic, reason and argumentative skills." 

Jordan Bilezikian, Junior majoring in philosophy, explains that acquiring such skills in reason is why he chose this major.

"Both history and philosophy are necessary for one's mind to think in a structured, logical manner," Bilezikian said. "Both disciplines also train the mind to see things from a unique perspective, a perspective which takes many things into account and one which does not just look at events or actions with tunnel vision."

These same analytical skills will allow them to transition into other jobs as well, such as those in governmental, political or research organizations. Marketing and Outreach Coordinator at Career Services, Dana DellaCamera, said that perhaps taking the next step after graduation will require more ingenuity on the part of the Philosophy student than in students of other majors. 

"With any Arts and Sciences major, there's a ton of opportunities, but it's not as delineated as with teaching or accounting - they're not as clearly defined," DellaCamera said. "That places the responsibility on the student to create their own future." 

Other similar positions might appeal more strongly to students' social consciences and interest in influencing society, including work at museums, or environmental, public works, religious or mental health organizations. 

DellaCamera explains that other careers, such as journalism or mass-communications, would benefit from the Philosophy student's strong grasp of language and eloquence. 

"A lot of media has to do with the law," DellaCamera said. "And they want people who can write, think and put stuff together quickly." 

While still in their undergraduate years, Philosophy students can take steps to prepare for their post-grad job search. One of the most beneficial is internship involvement, since many employers describe it as a characteristic of their ideal employee. 

DellaCamera adds that it can provide knowledge and experience not found in textbooks. 

"An internship can help them through exposure to the real world," DellaCamera said. "There are things you can learn outside the classroom that you can't learn inside." 

Yvette Duarte, Assistant Director at Career Services, encourages philosophy students to keep exploring and becoming involved in their undergraduate years. 

"Get a job at a law firm, even if it's not labeled as an internship," Duarte said. "You see the day-to-day and how people work. [I reccomen]dealing with Student Government, because of the life lessons and the leadership opportunities."

Another resource, Career Services recommends is the "What to do with your Major?" link on their web site at http://www.fiu.edu/%7Ecareer/student/explore/resources/bymajor.html. 

They also suggest doing a search for "philosophy" on www.usajobs.opm.gov, where as many as 80 positions appear, from Health Service administrator to special education teacher.

Headline: Table tennis club unites students, wins tournaments, promotes sport
Author: Delicia Johnson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When walking through the Graham Center, students may see a group of individuals playing table tennis. This group belongs to the FIU Table Tennis Club. (FIUTTC) provides recreational play and training for the FIU community and has won numerous tournaments in the Spring of 2007. FIUTTC defeated University of Miami, Florida Atlantic University and Barry University.  

FIUTTC is continuing what has been a decade-long tradition at FIU. The previous president, Juan Lee, handled all affairs and raised the status of FIU by hosting tournaments in the Pharmed Arena. After Lee passed away, FIUTTC was shut down in 2003 and later restarted in 2005. 

Since its new start, the club has grown under new management and with more advanced players. It has fifteen active members, ranging from freshman to alumni. 

The majors, interests and levels of experience vary greatly among members and welcomes beginners as well as pros and everyone in between.

"The club brings together people of all races, religions and sexes," said David Bermudez, Vice-President of FIUTTC. " We have a girl, Stephanie, who plays at a high level. We also have people from many countries, including India, The Philippines, Cambodia, Kuwait, South Africa, Colombia, [and many others]. Table Tennis is played in many countries at all different levels because it's a great sport that gets you active and can be played indoors in limited space at any time," said David Bermudez.

Although the purpose of the club is to play table tennis, friendships develop along the way and students find way a valuable way to spend their free time. 

"We want to utilize our time, instead of doing something unproductive. It's a good way to socialize," said Muhammad Hack. 

Bermudez agrees with Hack's mindset.

 "We don't just play table tennis together," he said. "Sometimes we play poker. We do other things together."

 Some members play other sports and games together, and others attend campus events together. 

Officers have many goals for the club.

"We want to show that ping pong is a professional sport. It takes dedication and practice," said Bermudez.

 For some members the main goal is to get better at the sport and to be challenged. 

"One of our major goals is to get a bigger space since our club is growing. They're [the members] are not getting the practice they really need," Bryce Talagtag, FIUTTC Coordinator said. Currently, FIUTTC is trying to get a space in the Pharmed Arena second floor. 

 The officers also hope FIUTTC will be funded by FIU. 

The club relies on membership fees to help pay for equipment and other expenses. When no funds are available, David Bermudez and Talagtag donate money and equipment, and Talagtag has contributed all prizes for the tournaments, including trophies, certificates and a constant supply of ping pong balls. 

Bermudez donated a table that cost $200. "We hope to show FIU that we as a club have the ability to bring much to FIU, and we hope that winning more tournaments proves that we deserve more attention than we receive from the University as a whole to help sponsor us with proper uniforms and practicing space", said Bermudez. 



The "FIU Open" is held each semester to collect funds and to see who has the potential to compete against other universities. On Nov. 3, FIUTTC will be holding the first FIU Table Tennis Invitational Tournament. 

FAU, Barry, and UM will be participating in this event, which will be held in the FIU Recreation Center.

FIUTTC strives to promote itself and the sport of table tennis. The officers want everyone to get involved. 

"Everyone is welcome", Bermudez said. To join the club, interested students can appear during FIUTTC's practice hours. 	FIUTTC meets Wednesday through Friday from 3 p.m. - 6:30 p.m.

Headline: Student Government: Skybox proposal rejected
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. & Eddith Sevilla / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
The Student Government Association convened for a University-wide meeting at the Biscayne Bay Campus Oct. 30 to discuss several key areas that will affect the student body. Among the topics discussed was spending $90,000 for the skybox's use in the new football stadium at University Park.

Costs would be broken down into $30,000 a year for the next three years, according to Arthur "AJ" Meyer, UP's Student Government Council vice president.

The original proposal, rejected by SGC-BBC, was presented to the executive board immediately after the Sept. 13 meeting. It consisted of a four-year contract that stipulated the payment of $20,000 for the first and second year and $40,000 for the third and fourth year for use of the skybox.

In a letter addressed to SGC-UP members, the SGC-BBC executive board said they did not want to participate in an SGA skybox purchase. 

Their reasoning included that only 120 students per year would benefit from its use compared to the over 30,000 students who pay activities and services fees. Students already pay athletic fees and should not have to pay again to use athletic facilities - the focus of SGA should not be toward perks. 

The second proposal for its expenditure has not been officially proposed and thus not approved.

"We want to make sure the entire Council is in favor of it because if one or two people are not ... we're not representing the entire student body," Meyer said.

Expanding on previous SGC-UP plans for a committee to evaluate other student governments throughout the country with the purpose of improving FIU's SGA, SGC-UP proposed plans for an FIU SGA self-evaluation. 

"We need to figure out how to smooth out the rough edges," Meyer said, who proposed the idea.

Katiana Saintable, SGC-BBC president, questioned the need for self-evalutation, though she admitted that there is always room for improvement.

"There is no harm in self assessment," Saintable said. "My personal opinion is that if it is [not] broken don't fix it."

When asked by Saintable what led the SGC-UP to believe that there needed to be an evaluation, Meyer claimed SGA procedures were not up to par, such as SGA's Web site.

Meyer commented SGC-UP was not trying to abolish SGC-BBC but looking to find the best method to run SGA. 

"It does not make any sense to me that there are two presidents supposedly with equal powers but yet one's on the Board of Trustees and the other on the Board of Directors," Meyer said.

Although SGC-BBC is open to discuss changes, Jonathan Doozan, SGC-BBC comptroller, expressed concerns over the proposed evaluations stating the dangers involved with considering the elimination of the current SGA governing system.

"It's not going to cost us anything with a group of us getting together a couple of times a month or once a week or however [to evaluate SGA]," replied Marbely Hernandez, SGC-UP president.

Despite the contention of whether or not a self-evaluation is needed, SGA agreed that it must be conducted in complete cooperation of both councils.

An outside group was suggested to evaluate SGA impartially; no group has been selected yet.

The next University-wide meeting will be Nov. 29 at 2 p.m. at UP.

Headline: Crist Passes Bill: Governor approves 5 percent tuition increase for Spring 2008
Author: Jessica Ariste / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's official - Florida students will be paying more for their college tuition starting January 2008.

Governor Charlie Crist signed a budget revision bill Oct. 26 that will increase tuition in state public colleges and universities by 5 percent starting this Spring. 

FIU estimates that the 5 percent increase will bring an additional $3 million to the school. 

Gov. Crist had vetoed a bill that proposed a tuition increase last summer, but said he signed the bill this time because he believes residents will be provided with other financial alleviations. Among these, he expects about 30 percent of the money provided by the tuition increase to go to financial aid.

The increase means that students will be paying about $55 extra per semester for 15 credits at FIU and other state universities. 

"All the public schools in the state are feeling this," said Monica Lee, a junior majoring in business at FIU.

The Board of Governors, which has had an ongoing legal battle with the legislature over the last few months in an attempt to raise tuition, supported the bill. 

One of their arguments is that the extra money received by tuition increase will go to students who need it most.

The bill signed by Crist last week also allows universities to require a technology fee of up to 5 percent of the tuition beginning in Fall 2009. In the special legislative session leading to this bill, it was also debated whether they should tie future tuition increases to inflation rates.

These urgent cuts in the budget occurred because the State of Florida cannot have a deficit and it did not generate as much money from taxes as was expected in the original $71 billion budget. 

This created a situation where the State legislature had to have a special session to deal with the $1.1 billion shortage.

The bill also requires cuts on the State's water supply projects and health care, like Medicaid.

The national average tuition per student for the 2005-2006 school year was of about $6,400, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. FIU's 2007-2008 tuition will be approximately $3,500 with the increase. The numbers indicate that even with the tuition increase, Florida students still have a national advantage.

"The tuition is really low and generally the education in this University is really good," said history professor Darden A. Pyron.

Oliver Gans, a senior at FIU majoring in economics, feels the increase will be worth it in the long run.

"It is about $100 a year, so after graduating college you would have paid an additional $400, but if [because you have a degree] you are able to get an additional $10,000 or so, the return is much larger than what you are having to invest," Gans said. 

In 2006, the State of Florida had a state Gross Domestic Product (value of all goods and services produced in the economy)of $609,958 million (chained), which is a 4.2 percent increase from 2005, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2006. The national GDP increased by 3.4 percent, which puts Florida among the highest states. The way it works is that the higher the GDP, the higher the potential living standards.

This means that the standard of living in Florida is higher than in many other states, yet the cost of tuition is among the lowest.

Along with the increase in tuition, the bill also cuts down about $230 million in Medicaid, approximately $165 million in aid provided to nursing homes and $30 million in the state's alternative water supply programs.

Chancellor of the State University System of Florida, Mark Rosenberg, said last week that the annual U.S. News & World Reports ratings of universities could have persuaded Gov. Crist and legislators to pass the bill. 

Two of Florida's public universities -University of Florida and Florida State University- made the best colleges in the United States list in August.

Headline: Protection necessary against Internet bugs
Author: Kevin Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
About four months ago, Samantha Murphey, a sophomore, started having problems with her Apple laptop after clicking a link that directed her to an infected Web site.

"I am not the best with computers, so when my computer started acting up I had no idea what caused it and what to do to stop it," Murphey said.

Murphey later took her laptop to CompUSA, an electronics retail store, to have it cleared of the spyware. 

"The technicians at CompUSA told me about spyware and how surfing the Internet causes spyware to build up on your computer and slow it down," Murphey said.

Janet Lopez, a Geek Squad computer repair technician at Best Buy, said it is essential to keep personal computers up-to-date in order to keep them clean.

"Computers are a precious tool to our generation -with new viruses, spyware, adware and exploits coming out every week to attack computers," Lopez said. 

Kathy Estoya, a computer repair representative at Tiger Direct, a computer component retail store, said that when it comes to upgrading computers, something to take into account is the type of computer. Desktop and laptop computers vary in size and brand and knowing enough to distinguish them can help make the difference between an hour at a computer repair store and three hours.

"Computer warnings are the best way to determine what upgrade is needed to get the computer back to optimal working order," Estoya said. 

If a computer alerts that it is running low on disk space, expanding the disk space will solve this problem, said Geraldo Espinosa, technician supervisor at University Technological Service at FIU.

"Disk space, measured in gigabytes, gives the user more space to save documents, images, music and anything else onto the computer," Espinosa said. "It is the single most important piece of hardware to students."

Lopez explained how to get around the problem of disc space.

"The first option is to delete things presently on the computer that are no longer in use or necessary," he said. If nothing substantial can be found to delete, the next option is to either buy a bigger hard drive or get an external hard drive."

Espinosa and Lopez agree that hard drive replacement depends on whether the computer is a laptop or desktop. 

"Desktops have a lot more room so it is easier to add another hard drive to them while laptops are small and compact so they, will not come with space for an additional hard drive," Espinosa said. "The only down side to upgrading the current hard drive is that all of the student's information will still be on the old hard drive."

As a third option, an external hard drive to store miscellaneous files can be used.

"Memory sticks can optimize computer performance by allowing a computer to run more programs and process information faster, according to Estoya.

"Having this extra memory will allow important programs like TrendMicro and SpyWare Sweeper [which protect your computer from spyware and viruses] to run without slowing down or crashing," Martino said.

Running programs on computers uses memory, which will cause the computer to slow down when processing information according to Christian Hernandez, technician for PC Max USA.

Lopez said that surfing the Internet causes spyware and adware to be downloaded onto a computer, which can damage a computer and cause it to processing speed, among other things.

Software, or the programs installed onto a computer, can be used to optimize a computer's performance. Programs such as anti-virus, anti-spyware, and anti-adware programs help keep performance for computers up by deleting many things that might harm the computer. 

"Software programs like Windows Defender are excellent for removing threatening files on PCs," Espinosa said. "Every computer should have one to two different spyware and adware programs as well as a primary anti-virus program."

Overall, Estoya wanted to remind everyone to take care of personal computers.

"Computers make life easier," said Estoya. "That is why we need to keep them up to date and clean."

Headline: PUSH OR PULL: Students abuse amenities meant for disabled
Author: Joseph Marhee / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It seems that most FIU students are handicapped - since they use the handicap button gracing the entrance to many doorways on campus.  But there are no slings, no casts, no visible handicaps; could it be that many FIU students are lazy but not lazy enough to press a button one, two, three or four times just to avoid opening the door manually? Actually, this is not a domestic travesty, it's a national phenomenon. 

The practice is highly disrespectful, an overuse of the button by students breaks the mechanism. One such location where this apathy is evident is the Graham Center. 

The automatic door with a sign explaining it's purpose for handicap use - note: it does not read "for use by the apathetic" - and that the policy is "strictly enforced." It actually isn't enforced at all, allowing anyone to utilize the  leisure of automatic doors.

If the policy were enforced, then a good majority of the FIU student and faculty body would be in violation.

When provided with the button that opens the door, students will stand there pressing the button two or even three times before the door opens. It's possible they realize that they could have opened the doors themselves in that time, but out of sheer stubbornness they disregard this rational thought.

Is it possible that the convenience of not using door handles is just too much for the stressed students to resist? Who wouldn't turn down something to perform an arduous task for you when you have deadlines and exams and all the stresses of the universe looming overhead?

Even so, the practice - regardless of convenience - is illogical and just plain ridiculous, especially the time used to press a button is in fact equivalent to the same power used to grab a door handle and swing it open.

Despite the absurdity in waiting an extra five or, in really extreme cases, ten seconds for a door to automatically open, this is most assuredly a conscious matter: more than 500 groups on Facebook.com, all with names to the effect of "I use the handicap door instead of manually opening doors, even though it takes twice as long"are dedicated to the automatic luxury button. 

Not only does that imply an acceptance of the pandemic of laziness going around, but that it's acceptable to admit that you take advantage of comforts put in place for those who aren't able-bodied.

Yet these events speak volumes of a greater apathy of our world: we have computers to do our taxes, order pizza and even a robotic vacuum cleaner. With that said, why should we have to use our hands to open doors?  

We should thus invent handless forks that automatically bring the food to our mouths, and cups that fill themselves! 

In a world where robots perform every imaginable task and people driving to places within walking-distance (i.e. from a dorm to GC), when does the nonsense cease? 

Maybe it could end with every man, woman and child being born with motors and four-wheel drive fused into their torsos. While that scenario isn't viable, the point is clear: we cannot rely on technology to do everything for us.

 In a more realistic setting, this is becoming an epidemic of absurdity.

Senior Carmelda Labaze agrees.

"It's just another trend leading allowing us to become a more sedentary species; we allow technology to do things for us," she said. "We've been programmed to think that convenience brings happiness." 

While technology is a luxury - there's nothing wrong with manual labor and using what we have: hands to open doors.

Headline: Intelligence quotient influenced by social factors, biology
Author: Sameer Mehta / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A friend once asked me, how come Asian studnets find a way to  get a 3.0 GPA while getting high scores on important tests?

Someting that friend didn't know was that biologists, particularly the population geneticists who study genetic variation, have found that there is a race structure in the human population; a family tree showing separate branches for Africans, Caucasians, East Asians, Pacific Islanders and American Indians.

In Asian tradition, education has been based on the strong beliefs of Confucius, who believed that education was the most powerful weapon to improve society in all aspects. 

This led parents and teachers in Asian societies to have high expectations. This also gave rise to high curriculum standards: long hours spent on learning, strict training in intellectual skills, a high degree of parent-child interaction at home, close teacher-pupil relations at school and high educational achievement. 

A good example that highlights the differences that exist between the way Asians and Americans may think is exhibited by a simple psychological test. In this test, a picture depicting ocean water with few plants, starfish and a turtle on the foreground is shown to both Asian and American students. Asian students tend to notice the sea, while American students notice the turtle. 

But does this really take us to the conclusion that intelligence quotient (IQ) should be solely based on race, which is considered a social factor rather than biological?

In a New York Times article, 2 Scholarly Articles Diverge on Role of Race in Medicine" the official statements endorsed by the American Sociological Association and the American Anthropological Association stated  that, "A view widespread among many social scientists is that race is not a valid biological concept."

What's interesting about this is that none of them are wrong because it is education, along with collective social interactions, that teaches students how to interpret a piece of information. 

It is all education and nurture that really matters, not race.

But then again, the question arises: why  do people from different origins have different IQ levels?

 It is the evolutionary progression of mankind that causes these disparities. During the early stages of human evolution Asian and Middle Eastern countries had warm and gentle environments that allowed their thoughts to expand, whereas people who stayed in colder climates  thought about their survival. 	

This also supports the fact that the brain capacity of East Asians is 1,416 cubic centimeters, compared to Europeans with 1367 cubic centimeters. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) find a correlation of brain size with IQ of about 0.40 percent.

But the paradoxical issue is that there are discrepancies in the IQ levels of students of the same race. 

According to Loring Brace, a intelligence researcher, the best example is the average IQ of the native African population, which is 70; versus those of African-Americans which is 85.

Some studies say that there are several alleles on a gene involved in the development of cerebral and neural functions but I think that intelligence is more complex. 

For intelligence to be genetically influenced means that intelligent students have to be as intelligent as their parents.

I believe it is actually both the socioeconomic and cultural environment that has caused disparities among different populations around the globe. Education in the United States and European countries is developed more on the basis of individual capabilities. 

The flexibility in the system has always given more importance to extracurricular activities rather than being exam oriented or making a compulsory curriculum which has to be followed. 

Whereas the cultural and socioeconomic background of Asians has developed their mathematical and analytical strength.

It's my view that if the East and the West can learn from each other and integrate each other's cultural strengths - individual initiative with team spirit, competitiveness with co-operativeness, technological skills with moral qualities - only then will universal values and a global ethic gradually develop.

Headline: 'Best Buddies' looks past differences
Author: Amanda Massa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Community service doesn't make the top priorities list of many Student Organization Council clubs on campus, but it's the only focus of FIU's chapter of Best Buddies, a club that is helping create friendships between students and those with disabilities. 

The organization was created on the premise that many do not understand people with disabilities and that those with the disabilities are often feared according to Samantha Disse, the FIU chapter's president.

"We want to show people that [the disabled] have many abilities that we don't and they are equal to us," Disse said. 

The club is part of a worldwide organization with over 360 active campus chapters that help match up college students and people with disorders such as down syndrome, autism or fetal alcohol syndrome. 

Buddies are matched by their likes and dislikes and form a one-on-one friendship. 

"People with disabilities don't get a fair chance, but in this organization, we help connect them with people who are willing to give them a chance and create real, meaningful friendships," said Laura Ramirez, sophomore and member of Best Buddies.

Buddies interact once a week through a phone call and meet once a month to socialize. Time spent together is spent at the movies, bowling alleys, nightclubs and other locations, according to Disse. 

"When you join Best Buddies, you become the buddy's world," Disse said. "You mean everything to them. If you tell them you're going to call them at 5 o'clock and it's 5:15 they will already be calling you worried about you. They really love you." 

With over 30 members, the FIU chapter is busy trying to make a difference in the lives of their buddies by developing the strongest bonds possible with them. 

"They love bowling," Disse said.

The FIU chapter will often bowl with their buddies on Saturdays. 

"It's awesome to be with them," said Gabriel Carias, a current Best Buddies member. "We went out bowling in a large group and the buddies were getting higher scores than us. It's fun to compete with them," Carias said.

Disse said that one buddy manages to get high scores despite the fact that he has no legs. 

"He just crawls on his legs and bowls and gets almost perfect strikes every time. It's amazing," Disse said. 

Although people often stare or shoot awkward glances in their direction while they are in public, Disse said that the buddies remain genuine. 

"Buddies have a better perspective on life than most people," said Disse. 

When a buddy asked if she liked bowling, Disse told him no because she was not any good at it.  

"He told me, 'you can never get good at something until you try and try again. My motto in life is until you are good, you don't stop trying,'" Disse said. 

Ramirez feels that one of the greatest benefits of being in Best Buddies is getting to know the buddies. 

"Best Buddies is not a charity act. It is a way to meet new people who are just as fun and full of surprises as anyone else you would meet," Ramirez said. "It is a way to get people to look past our differences and look at the person inside."   

The FIU chapter of Best Buddies is open to all FIU students. 

"While making a difference in someone's life you also make an impact on your own life. It's a reciprocal relationship that exists between buddies. Your buddy teaches you about patience, friendship, relationships and, most importantly, acceptance," Ramirez said.

Athletes verbally assault lab assistant:
Four FIU football players called a student and biology lab assistant a "butterfly" and told her she'd look better without her lab coat on, according to a police report filed by Campus Safety on Oct. 22.	

The report claims that the players, Brad Serini, Bryant Curtis, Jason Frierson and Ricky Booker, were "disruptive and failed to behave during class." The report also claims that the four acted "aggressively and disrespectfully" because they did not comply with the rules of the lab, such as misconduct measures or with their grades and academic reports in the class. 

The players are also said to have crowded the lab assistant's desk, making her feel uncomfortable. 

One player offered to take off his shorts. Other players touched the lab assistant's shoulder and made distracting noises.

According to the report, the players issued a letter of apology to the lab assistant. 

Evan Koch, associate athletic media relations director said that Athletics was aware of the incident and was evaluating the situation to take appropriate disciplinary action. 

He said that the athletics director and head football coach will determine what repercussions, if any, the players will face. 



Golden Panther Arena donor declares bankruptcy:
The Pharmed Group, a Miami-based medical supply company, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Carlos and Jorge Cespedes founded the company in 1980.

The business donated $1 million to the FIU Athletic Department resulting in the Golden Panther Arena changing its name to the present Pharmed Arena in 2004. It was the largest donation ever given to the Athletic Department.

At the time of the donation, Hispanic Business Magazine listed the Pharmed Group as the eighth-largest Hispanic business in the United States.

The state of Florida matched the $1 million contribution which the company was set to pay over the next six years.

When Johnson and Johnson severed ties with the company in 2005, the Pharmed Group struggled to replace the sales lost.

The Pharmed Group was not available to comment at the time of publication.

Headline: TOP OF THE WORLD: Former FIU third baseman leads Sox to championship
Author: Mike Fitzpatrick / Ap Wire
&nbsp;
For the second time in his career, Mike Lowell found himself drenched in champagne and celebrating a World Series title, but this  time around, things were even sweeter for the FIU alumnus, as he was awarded wih the World Series MVP trophy.

Drenched from the celebration in Boston's bustling clubhouse, Lowell clutched his new trophy and broke into a sheepish smile.

He's much more than some throw-in on a Red Sox trade, and he knows it. He's the World Series MVP.

The steady third baseman capped off an outstanding October with a big performance Oct. 28, helping Boston finish a four-game sweep with a 4-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies.

"We've got a lot of people to give credit to," he said. 

Lowell homered, doubled and scored twice in the Game 4 clincher at Coors Field, dirtying his uniform with a headfirst slide at the plate that typified his whatever-it-takes attitude. 

He hit .400 (6-for-15) in the Series with four RBIs, three walks and a team-high six runs.

"Pretty good throw-in, I guess," said Lowell, a survivor of testicular cancer. "Icing on the cake. This is just extra special."

When the Red Sox swept St. Louis in 2004 for their first championship in 86 years, Lowell was still in Florida. This time, he's got an invitation to the party.

In his time with the Marlins, he was a key member of a team that won the World Series in 2003, upsetting his current team's rivals, the New York Yankees. His road to to Boston saw him go from a hometown boy, playing high school ball with Coral Gables Senior High School and the FIU Golden Panthers.

Lowell's years in a Golden Panther uniform were among the most successful in the program's history. He was the only player in team history to be chosen as a Division 1 Academic All-American, racking up a career .353 batting average, fifth in team history, while completing his degree in finance two years after being chosen by the Yankees in the 20th round of the 1995 draft.

In 2004, Lowell had his number retired by the FIU baseball team, becoming just the 3rd player to have that honor bestowed upon him. In 2006, Lowell was one of five other athletes and coaches from FIU history to be chosen as the first class of the FIU Sports Hall of Fame.

A key piece in Boston's powerful lineup, Lowell bats fifth behind David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez. 

Lowell's job is to protect those big boppers by driving in enough runs to make opponents think twice about walking them.

Few could have done it better this year.

Lowell set career bests by batting .324 with a team-leading 120 RBI. Pretty good numbers to show potential suitors in the offseason, when he can become a free agent.

His best sales pitch, however, might be his production under pressure.

Lowell hit .348 this postseason with two homers and 13 RBIs. 

He did it quietly, like almost everything. But that doesn't mean it went unnoticed.

About 15 minutes after the final out, a huge horde of red-clad Boston fans behind the third base dugout chanted "MVP! MVP!" for Lowell and "Re-sign Lowell! Re-sign Lowell!"

"Free agency to me is very new, so I'm going to take it step by step. But I've never hid the fact that I enjoy playing here in Boston," Lowell said. "I have great teammates, a great manager, [and] great coaches, so we'll see what happens. But I'm more focused on celebrating right now."

A four-time All-Star, Lowell got tossed into the Beckett trade because the small-budget Marlins wanted to shed his $9 million salary after he had a disappointing season.

The Red Sox plugged him in at third base, and they've been rewarded with two fine years of professionalism and leadership.

"I was the throw-in in the deal. They needed Josh Beckett," Lowell said last week. "They needed to get a top right-handed pitcher, and I don't think the Red Sox after the '05 season were [saying] like, 'Lowell has to be in that deal for us to take Beckett.' I'm sure that's not the way they were going."

It was Beckett who won the 2003 World Series MVP for the surprising Marlins.

Now, Lowell has a gleaming prize of his own, and he earned a $500,000 contract bonus for winning the award.

"I think in '03 no one expected us to do anything, so we were kind of beating the odds each time," Lowell said. "But I think it's a little different when, from the onset, a lot of people are expecting you to win a world championship and if you don't it's a disappointing year. For us to come through and do what we thought we were capable of doing is unbelievable."

Headline: Notebook: Team looks to halt streak against conference foe
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Following a 58-10 loss at Arkansas the 0-8 Golden Panthers will head back to the natural state to take on Sun Belt Conference foe Arkansas State (3-5). 

Last week, FIU was crushed mainly by Arkansas's running game, which put up 249 rushing yards and scored six touchdowns. 

Junior running back Darren McFadden scored four of those touchdowns, but they all came on runs of less than five yards. 

On a positive note for FIU the defense held McFadden to 61 rushing yards which was the second-lowest total this season for the Heisman hopeful. 

In FIU's own rushing game, freshman quarterback Wayne Younger rushed for a season-high 124 yards, setting his fourth FIU single game rushing record for a quarterback. 

FIU's losing streak has now reached 20 games. However, FIU's next four games are against teams that are under .500, so snapping the streak is a definite possibility this season. The all-time mark for consecutive loses in Division I-A history is 34 by Northwestern University from 1979-1982. 

Assuming FIU does not lose out this season and all of next season, we will not need to worry about setting that record. For now, they must cope with having the longest current streak in the nation. 

Arkansas State is led by sophomore quarterback Corey Leonard, who has passed for 1,681 yards and 13 touchdowns and rushed for 377 yards and three touchdowns, making him yet another mobile threat for the FIU defense to handle. 

The Indians also have a running back in sophomore Reggie Arnold, who has gained 720 yards on the ground and is averaging nearly seven yards per carry. 

To stop Arkansas State, FIU will need to shutdown the run the way they did last season. FIU will also need to stop turning the ball over. 

Against Arkansas, FIU turned the ball over seven times and is now tied for last place in Division I-A in turnover margin.  

FIU's four remaining games are against Sun Belt Conference teams. This trip to Arkansas State will be FIU's final away game this season and will conclude the season in the Orange Bowl against Louisiana-Lafayette, Florida Atlantic and North Texas.

Headline: Volleyball splits weekend series versus Sun Belt powers
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Just two weeks ago, Sun-Belt Conference powerhouses Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee marched into Pharmed Arena and stomped all over the Golden Panthers.

With the taste of defeat still in their mouths, the Golden Panthers went on the road in hopes of avenging the losses and responded with a two-day stretch of passionate play that lessened the mental effects of the previous losses.



FIU 3 WKU 0



With a dominant history against the Golden Panthers, perhaps the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers expected the Oct. 26 contest to follow suit. 

However, a hungry Golden Panther team with revenge on its mind didn't play the part, cruising to a 3-0 (30-23, 30-19, 30-21) win at Diddle Arena in Bowling Green, Ky.	

Freshman hitter Ines Medved was the catalyst early, notching five out of her six kills in the game in the opening set. 

Fellow sophomore Olga Vergun had a balanced game with eight kills, seven digs and five blocks, senior Mina Spasojevic contributed six kills, and six blocks, while Andra Rasby chipped in with 12 digs. 

The ever-consistent Yarimar Rosa didn't see her personal play falter with the team effort, as she led the way with a smooth 13-kill, 10-dig and five-block performance. 

Senior setter Keila Oliveira ran the offense with 30 assists and eight digs in the victory. 

Hilltopper All-American Megan Argabright was limited to just nine kills on 23 attempts. Brittany Bowen had a team-high 11 kills and Aquilla Orr pounded eight kills in the tough loss for the Hilltoppers.

It was the first ever road win for the Golden Panthers against a Hilltopper squad that looked nothing like the team they faced just weeks ago in Miami.

In that match, power hitter Jenna Gideon led the team with 15 kills, while Argabright and Bowen had 13 kills a piece. 

This time around, Gideon was nearly invisible on the court and the team committed 10 service errors. Meanwhile, the Golden Panthers saw improvement as opposed to regression. 

In the first meeting, Rosa carried the team with a 21-kill, eight-dig performance and Vergun did her part with 17 kills, but the rest of the team committed 18 service errors en route to the loss. 



MTSU 3 FIU 1



Even with an upset win to their credit, the Golden Panthers had little time to celebrate, looking ahead to their much anticipated date with the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders at the Alumni Memorial Gym in Murfreesboro, Tenn. Although the Blue Raiders still prevailed with a 3-1 (30-26, 27-30, 30-27, 30-27) victory, the Golden Panthers performed better than the last time out.

Rosa led the way with 20 kills and 10 digs and, once again, her teammates provided strong support throughout the match. 

Vergun provided 16 kills, eight blocks and eight digs. Anita Szymanska notched 12 kills on a blistering .511 clip with no errors. 

For the second straight game, Medved made it into double-figure kills with 11 and Oliveira orchestrated the offense with 54 assists.

Ashley Adams was unstoppable for the Blue Raiders, proving to be the thorn in the side of the Panthers with 20 kills and 10 digs on the night. Ashley Asberry complemented her with 13 kills and six blocks, while Leslie Clarke shined with 55 assists and 13 digs. 

In their first meeting this year, the Golden Panthers were in the middle of a four-game losing skid, but played nothing like a desperate team in a 3-0 loss. In that game, Rosa was the lone Golden Panther in double digit kills with 15, as the Blue Raiders dominated. 

"I was very proud of our team and this was the first time since maybe preseason that I thought everybody left 100 percent on the court," said coach Danijela Tomic. "We were on a mission and we executed our game plan to perfection, even in the loss. We really fought and I told the team we will go get them in the conference tournament."

Headline: Men fall to Kentucky despite dominating performance
Author: Luca Messina / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team lost a very tough game Oct. 27 at University Park 2-1 to the University of Kentucky.

"I think we dominated this game from top to bottom," said coach Munga Eketebi. "This is a game we should have won."

FIU (2-10-2, 2-4-0 Conference USA) played more aggressively but Kentucky (6-7-2; 4-2-0) was able to escape with two mind boggling goals. 

After sophomore Christian Caporaletti couldn't capitalize on a one-timed pass from junior Levi Coleman in the sixth minute, Kentucky's C.J. Tappel would put the Wildcats up 1-0 at the 12th minute. The goal was set up on a free kick by Masumi Turnbull as Turnbull sailed a shot right to Tappel who headed it in for the score.  

The goal did not damper the spirits of the Golden Panthers as they were clearly determined to even things up. 

"Our attitude has changed. Where it seemed as if we would sometimes give up after a goal, we have been playing with a different attitude lately," Eketebi said. 

Only 20 minutes later FIU would get on the board as sophomore Juan Guerra impressively dribbled past two defenders to rip a shot high into the right corner for the score. 

The goal was the fifth of the season for Guerra who culminated his score with a signature celebration dance with two fellow teammates. The game would end up being tied 1-1 at the half with FIU having 10 shots compared to Kentucky's two. 

The second half was almost a mirror to the first, with Kentucky's lone goal being the difference. 

In the 61st minute, Kentucky's Brad Frederick launched a floating shot from almost midfield that was just out of reach for junior goalkeeper Matias Wilson, who was replacing fellow junior goalkeeper Kyle Thomas.

"Both of their scores were soft goals," Eketebi said. 

And that was all the Wildcats would need in sealing the victory. 

FIU had many opportunities to tie the score, particularly in 71st minute when senior Mario Franco fired a free kick that was nicely saved by Kentucky goalkeeper Dan Williams. Williams was in good position often, which was critical as FIU put much pressure on the opposing defense. 

Despite the overwhelming support from a loud crowd, FIU couldn't net the tying goal in and took their disappointing 10th loss of the year.  After winning two of their last three, the Golden Panthers did taste a difficult defeat in this contest. It was particularly tough because they out shot their opponent 16-6 and played with more aggression. 

"I really haven't seen a team in the conference that we cannot beat," he said. "That's why it is so important that we get to the conference tournament." 

With four games remaining, they will look to take as many victories as they can. Three of those four games will be on the road, which will make the task even more challenging.

Women's soccer:
FIU 3 ASU 2

The Golden Panthers (3-9-3) captured their first Sun Belt Conference victory of the season defeating the Arkansas State Indians (3-12-1) 3-2 on Oct. 26 at University Park.

FIU was trailing by two goals, but freshman Claudia Cardenas and Kassandra Sorzano led the Golden Panthers to victory combining for all three goals. Sophomore Marina Pappas provided the assists for the first two goals.

Back-to-back goals by the Indians in the 31st and 33rd minute put the Golden Panthers in a 2-0 deficit. Cardenas would cut the lead in half before the second half, heading a cross from Pappas.

In the 53rd minute of play, Sorzano evened the score with an open shot in front of the net at an unorthodox angle. 

Pappas would continue the offensive rhythm placing an accurate pass at Cardenas' feet as she put in the game-winning goal in the 67th minute.



UALR 2 FIU 1 



A long, tiring season contributed to the Golden Panthers (3-10-3) allowing two late goals, losing to the University of Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans (10-9) Oct. 28 at University Park.

According to head coach Thomas Chestnutt, the team has played a lot of minutes this season and fatigue set in.

The first period featured little offensive productivity as neither team created any scoring threats, resulting in a scoreless first 45 minutes.

However, in the 53rd minute, freshman Miriam Mercado would put the Golden Panthers ahead with a shot inside the penalty box.

FIU grudgingly held on to the one-goal lead until the fatigue coach Chestnutt alluded to reared it's head in the 78th minute. The Trojans' Leanne Mihelich tied the game with her ninth goal of the season.

With two minutes left in regulation, the Golden Panthers' defensive front could no longer contain the UALR offense. 

The Trojans' Courtney Renfro shot at the goal, only to have it rebound back to her. Goalkeeper Madeline Gannon dove for the shot, leaving the net empty as Renfro's second shot hit the back of net.

The score sealed the win and gave the Golden Panthers' their 10th loss of the season.



Men's and Women's Cross Country



The women's cross country teams finished in fourth place and the men placed fifth Oct. 27 at the Sun Belt Conference Championship meet in Bowling Green, Ky.

Seniors Paola Reategui and Deidra Witherspoon finished in fifth and 10th place, respectively, during individual competition. They earned All-Sun Belt Conference honors for a second consecutive year. 

Reategui completed the 5K run with a time of 18:10.45, while Witherspoon finished the race in 18:39.55.

On the men's side, brothers Andrew and Alvin Charles led the team. Older brother Alvin finished the 8K competition in 26:37.70 for 18th place, while Alvin placed 24th with a time of 27:15.17.



Women's swimming and diving



The swimming and diving team lost to Sun Belt Conference rival New Orleans 178-154 in competition at the Phil Hansel Duals, hosted by the University of Houston at the Campus Recreation & Wellness Center Natatorium. Rice, Houston and BYU also defeated FIU in head-to-head competition.

Junior Sara Giovannoni led the team with a season-best time of 5:12.34 in the 500-yard freestyle, good for ninth place, and 2:23.12 in the 200-yard breaststroke for second place. Fellow junior Lindsey Overman placed ninth and 10th in the 100-yard (1:01.09) and 200-yard butterfly (2:16.12), respectively.
