Headline: shape probes human relationships
Author: Claudia Ortega / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
"At least I'm educated, so I comprehend that I'm f***ed." With that, Adam, one of the characters of Neil LaBute's play "The Shape of Things," clarifies his problems with student loans and a college education. 

It also proves my point: This play is best enjoyed and understood by college students. I came to that conclusion as I was walking out of GableStage, awed by what I had just seen, and heard an elderly woman behind me - the average audience member was no younger than 35 years old - say that she found the play to be "a bit 'whory'." 

Granted, there is a sex scene and there is nudity, and maybe it wasn't exactly crucial to the plot that we see two characters humping, but it's hard to avoid gratuitous sex anywhere. Luckily, "The Shape of Things" owes its controversy and shock value to something a lot more satisfying than one gratuitous sex scene: a plot twist.  

Exploring issues of inhibitions, rebellion, loyalty (to others and to yourself), friendships and relationships through the lives of twenty-somethings in a liberal arts college, the play is more readily understood and related to by a younger crowd. 

Neil LaBute, playwright and filmmaker whose credits include the films "In the Company of Men" and "Friends and Neighbors," probes the ubiquitous question: "What is art?" in this play.  As tiresome and overdone as the topic may seem, LaBute infuses his play with witty, intelligent dialogue and handles the ultimate question with such an innovative and unexpected approach that your mouth will be unwillingly gaping by the time the play is over.

Of course, the effect of the play is augmented when you have a stellar ensemble working on the production. The set is comprised of different, vividly-colored, Mondrian-like panels which slide back and forth insinuating different settings and leaving room for personal interpretation. 

The sound is also well-done, using a slight echo in the scene in which we are transported to an auditorium. Directing the play is Joseph Adler, GableStage's artistic director. And last but not least, the talented cast adds humanity to their roles.

Claire Tyler, who received her BFA in drama from FIU, shines as Evelyn, a bold, adventurous, intellectual art grad student who questions conventions and stimulates controversy in everyone she meets. Evelyn is by far the most interesting character and Tyler knows when to effectively peel back and expose another layer of the complex character; for instance, she abandons her breathy Marilyn Monroe-like voice, which becomes a bit annoying at times, when she chooses to expose her real feelings.

Terrell Hardcastle, who co-starred with Tyler in the recent production of Comic Potential at Actors' Playhouse, plays the spineless, unassuming Adam who is just "fine being nothing" convincingly.  Hardcastle's skill makes Adam's metamorphosis seem entirely natural to Adam while making everyone else uneasy with it.

Laif Gilbertson and Autumn Horne, who play Adam's friends Phillip and Jenny, round out the cast and add another dimension to the play. 

Their relationship with each other and Adam is complex, and, as they become strained, we start to see Evelyn's disastrous effect on the people who cross her path. 

The ultimate message of the play is universal, but I think LaBute had a certain audience in mind, otherwise he would have picked a different cosmos to wrap around his theme. In fact, when I walked into the theater and heard Pearl Jam's Yield playing, I didn't understand what was going on; it didn't quite seem to fit in with the well-dressed, sophisticated audience.  

During scene changes, Smashing Pumpkins' Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness blasts over the house PA system (a device used by LaBute in his London premiere to keep people from discussing anything while the lights were off). 

I encourage everyone to go see this play.  Even if you dismiss the large, philosophical issue brought up, you will nevertheless be entertained. 

It moves along at a quick pace, never giving you time to check your watch, and its surprise is well worth the ticket price.

Headline: "8 Mile" proves Eminem multi-talented
Author: Jay Santiago
&nbsp;
The role of Jimmy Smith Jr. in "8 Mile" is literally the one Eminem was born to play, which makes the Oscar buzz seem all too deceiving. Eminem's onscreen presence is great simply because he was not acting, instead he did what came naturally: he was himself. 

The film was directed by Curtis Hanson and produced by Brian Glazer, which brings credibility to a movie that most likely would have been blasted by critics as another product from a rapper-wannabe-actor. Despite all this, the movie is quite good.  

The name "8 Mile" comes from a Detroit street that separates the white and black neighborhoods. The movie chronicles the life and career of Jimmy Smith Jr., who is better known by his nickname, Rabbit. 

Jimmy teeters on failure, working at a steel mill in Detroit, suffering a bad break-up with his girlfriend and dealing with a gang that wants him dead. Every day becomes a challenge to get to work, to have a place to live in, simply to survive. 

Through most of the movie, Rabbit lives in a trailer with his mom (Kim Basinger) and her boyfriend, who happens to be one of Jimmy's high-school classmates. Living with a failure is nothing new to Basinger, after all she was married to Alec Baldwin. 

The movie deals mainly however with Rabbit and his D-12-like posse, led by Mekhi Phifer, as they try to escape the ghetto with their musical talents. Rabbit must force people to look past his skin color, which proves to be quite difficult. He enters battles, which are rap contests to see who can get the crowds out of their seats with their free-style in the time alotted. At times, Rabbit is so nervous he can't muster out a line; at one point he even throws up on his sweater. 

Bring in Brittany Murphy (who serves no purpose other than acting as a slut) who gives Jimmy the confidence to showcase his talent on stage after double crossing Rabbit and having sex with most of his friends. The movie also carries slight undertones that delve into Eminem the artist instead of Marshall Mathers the person. 

The contrast between the two is quite interesting, showing how Marshall as Jimmy is pretty boring. Rabbit and Eminem are the ones who truly bring out the life of the character. Also on display is the fact that Eminem/Jimmy is pretty self-absorbed. He puts the group, his mom and the girl aside. The only one who can get to him in the movie is his sister, a thinly veiled replacement of Hailey, his real-life daughter. 

In an undeniable example of life definitely not imitating art, Rabbit is a champion of both women and gays in "8 Mile," at one point coming to the aid of a homosexual who was being made fun of by a coworker.

Scenery in "8 Mile" plays a huge role. Broken cars and homes are the backdrop. There is no sugar-coating, it's startlingly real, making the events all the more moving and deserving of sympathy.    

Eminem has definitely reached icon status. Currently, he has the number one movie, album and single in the country.  Love him or hate him, one can not doubt his talent as an artist. The beautiful thing of this movie is that it displays the ugly side of things, demonstrating a true appreciation for hip-hop and how it's made, and the sacrifices one must overcome to step into an industry not many appreciate.

Headline: Volleyball ends season with loss
Subheadline: Golden Panthers lose chance to repeat as Sun Belt Champs
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Adriana Fundora recorded her 12th double-double on the season with 10 kills and 11 digs in a losing effort for FIU. Jennifer Owens had eight kills.

The Trojans of UALR were led by Ivana Kuzmic's match-high 11 kills and Alexandria Hepburn's 10 blocking assists.

The match was the final one for Golden Panther senior Vanessa Gonzalez-Vinas. Gonzalez-Vinas finished with nine digs.

FIU ends the season 8-22 and 2-12 in the Sun Belt Conference. UALR improves its record to 13-12 and 9-5 in the Sun Belt.

The dismal 2002 season was a big contrast from the record-setting 2001 campaign.

FIU finished the 2001 season with a 24-8 record overall, finishing 9-5 in Sun Belt Conference play. The team also won its first conference title and advanced to the NCAA Tournament before being eliminated by the Gators of the University of Florida.

The loss of senior Nirvana Kos was a significant setback for the squad. Kos, the 2001 Sun Belt Tournament MVP, was forced to sit out the remainder of this season due to a degenerative disk in her back.

At the time, head coach Cookie Stevens gave words of encouragement to her team calling for her players to "move on...We've been through adversity before and we will prevail."

Unfortunately for FIU, the team dropped six straight matches after it was announced Kos was out for the year. 

In its final 20 matches of the season, the Golden Panthers managed just four wins against 16 defeats.

A source close to the team also attributed the teams' subpar season to "internal conflicts"  between players on the team.

The source refused to  specify any further.

Headline: Football prepares for FAU
Subheadline: Injuries mount; Burke named Division I-AA Independent Offensive Player of the Week
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panther football team was able to rest up this week. The squad had its second bye week of the season after a thrilling come-from-behind victory over Albany. FIU trailed the Great Danes 20-0 at halftime before eventually rallying to a 35-26 win in the team's final home game of the 2002 season. 

Quarterback Jamie Burke  was a big reason for the Golden Panther victory as he completed 17 of 30 passes for 243 yards and 4 touchdowns. As a result of his performance, the NCAA named Burke Independent I-AA Offensive Player of the Week. The freshman from Sarasota/ Cardinal Mooney High School becomes the second FIU player to be given this honor. Running back Rashod Smith was awarded the same honor after his 262 rushing yard performance against Jacksonville Halloween night.

"Jamie's progress this year has been like night and day," head coach Don Strock said. "There was just so much to learn, from picking up blitzes and dogs, to linebackers. It's difficult, especially for a young guy. In high school they didn't do a lot of that. Things have been coming at him fast and new, but he's adjusted very well."

The week off comes at a time when the Golden Panthers are feeling the effects of a long season. Tight end Joe Struyf (Marathon/Marathon) was back to practice Thursday for the first time in three weeks after suffering a bone bruise of the left ankle. Struyf is expected to play Saturday versus Florida Atlantic. Offensive lineman D.J. O'Neal (Clewiston/Clewiston) returned after sitting out with a lower back strain. Starting defensive tackle Nick Carreño (Miami/Belen) left Thursday's workout early with a toe sprain while tight end Edwin Pierre (Miami/North Miami) went down with a left Achilles strain. Both are expected back for practice at Community Stadium on Monday afternoon.

FIU's final game figures to be the beginning of an annual rivalry. Don't allow FAU's dismal 1-9 record fool you. The Owls have faced a tougher schedule than the Golden Panthers. FAU's lone win this season came against Morris Brown, a scholarship program. FIU has yet to defeat a scholarship opponent.  The Owls also faced Division I-A Troy State this year, a team FIU faces in 2003, losing 21-6.

"Right now we really want to get over this final hurdle and finish on a winning note," Strock said.

&nbsp;
FIU defeated the Florida All-Stars, 71-65, in its final exhibition contest at Golden Panther Arena. FIU (1-1 in the exhibition season) had three players in double figures. Junior Matias finished with a team-high 20 points. Eulis Baez added a game-high 13 rebounds, recording his first double-double as a Golden Panther, with 11 points.

Carlos Morban dished out a team-high four assists and added 10 points. Nicola Novakovic posted nine points and nine rebounds. 

The Florida All-Stars were led by Bernard Herd's 21 points and seven rebounds.

Slavtcho Slavtchev scored nine to lead the Golden Panthers. FIU shot 14-for-31 (45-percent) from the floor as a team.

FIU took a 50-43 lead to open the second half. Matias hit a three-pointer. Morban and Matias later put the Golden Panthers up 68-62 on two lay-ups and a free throw.

FIU opens the regular season on November 23 and 24 as the team hosts the FIU/Hampton Inn Tip-Off Classic. 

FIU signs power forward

Seminole Community College forward Kitus Witherspoon has signed a National Letter of Intent to play basketball for the Golden Panthers beginning in the 2003-04 season.

Witherspoon averaged 15.2 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. The 6-7, 245-pound sophomore was named one of the Sporting News magazine's top-ten junior college sophomores.

FIU added two junior college transfers last off-season. Matias and Baez transferred from Southeaster Community College in Iowa.
Witherspoon, a graduate of Boone High School in Orlando, FL, had a great amount of success his senior season when he was named to the all-state honorable mention team that season, after averaging 10.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, four assists and one steal per game. Witherspoon was also instrumental in leading Boone to the Class 6A state final in that same year.

Headline: "Mental_floss" provides fun, education
Author: Claudia Ortega / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Did you know that President James Garfield could write Greek with one hand and Latin with the other at the same time?  That berets were originally worn in ancient Greece and Rome?  That the guy on the cover of Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here was really on fire?  Or that St. Joseph of Cupertino, an uneducated Franciscan, is patron saint of astronauts due to the fact that he could levitate?  I doubt it.  

Have you ever wanted to know how instant film works, or to learn about the art of making an obento, the Japanese equivalent of a lunch box?  You've probably never even thought about it.  

But for those who like the concept of the Renaissance Man, or who just want to be able to start a conversation about something other than the latest fads, Mental_ floss, a magazine that premiered last summer, should be the reading material of choice.

The concept behind Mental_floss is making knowledge accessible. 

 "People love to feel smart, but nobody wants to work for that knowledge. Mental_floss takes the chore out of learning by blurring the lines between a great education and great entertainment," the magazine claims.  

Mental_floss isn't simply an agglomeration of trivia useful only for those nights when you're stuck at home watching "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" Instead, each section (scatter_brained, right_brain, left_brain, spinning_the globe and critical_knowledge) contains at least one article that will teach you something you may have missed during your high school or college career.  

As you can tell by the facts stated above, it's an eclectic mix of stuff you've always wanted to know and stuff you never even knew existed.  

The idea for the magazine was born in the Duke University cafeteria when Will Pearson and Mangesh Hattikudur realized how popular an educational magazine could become.  They decided they wanted it to be "the type of publication that was funny and entertaining, but also really made us feel like we'd learned something."  

Throughout the magazine, you'll find tons of useless facts, the kinds of anecdotes and random information everyone likes to showoff with.  And like popular teen magazines, there's even a quiz.  You won't find out how much you can trust your best friend, but you can learn things like: Which was the first American television show to air a flushing toilet?

With a clean, appealing layout, lots of vivid colors and unusual pictures and illustrations, it lures anyone with an eye for great design and a short attention span.  The articles are typically short, well written and witty.  It's definitely an unprecedented magazine in terms of content, design and even audience.  

According to the "founding flossers," Pearson and Hattikudur, their audience includes busy professionals in the 20 to 50 year-old age group, retirees and teenagers. 

Since its premier issue came out in the summer of 2001, it's been chosen as one of the "Top 10 New Magazines of 2001" by Library Journal, and it's had praise heaped on it by papers like The Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune.  

In the Tribune, the headline read: "For the discerning intellect, Mental_floss cleans out the cobwebs."  All the buzz hasn't gone unnoticed: the first four issues averaged 60 percent newsstand sales (the average for new magazines is only 30 percent).  

Already in the works for the future are a book series and a syndicated radio piece called "Mental_floss minute."  They're also looking forward to possibly producing board games, calendars and something for the "kiddies."

If you want to surprise your professors or loved ones with your brilliance or if you just want to be able to answer more questions on "Jeopardy," Mental_floss is for you.  You could check them out online for more information, including subscriptions and daily quizzes, at www.mentalflossmag.com.

Headline: "Streetcar" rides on
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
Great theater works as a kind of time machine, either by capturing and allowing us to revisit a specific moment again and again, or by simply making us forget all the years that separate us from any given play's original opening night. Time slips away so effectively from FIU Theater's new production of Tennessee William's "Streetcar Named Desire" that one could almost swear Williams himself was somewhere in the crowd, hiding his nervousness behind a witty remark or two. 

Leroy Clark's straightforward direction remains faithful to the 1947 play, attempting no misguided modernizations or re-examinations (like the 1999 Off Broadway production that tried to tell the tale from Stanley Kowalski's point of view, and ended up being appallingly explicit). The setting is still somewhere in Louisiana during the  1940s, and there's still a streetcar named Desire that leads Blanche Dubois to Stanley Kowalski, as opposed to, say, a spaceship named Desire.

Blanche , the ultimate Southern belle (if only in her own eyes), is running away from a past she drowns in liquor and endless baths. When financial necessity forces her to sell her childhood estate, she takes refuge with her sister Stella, who is married to Stanley, with whom she has built a precarious home. Stanley is a man's man, with all the connotations that ludicrous phrase brings: good sport, always ready with a joke, takes his poker games seriously, is not above beating up his wife if the need so arises, etc&#8230;

Naturally, the gentle, deceitful Blanche and brutal, honest Stanley are bound to collide. After all, "Streetcar" is less about a social dilemma or about a tense family situation than it is about seeing those two titans of the stage being pitted against each other.

Stanley relentlessly sets out to humiliate his sister-in-law, dig out every secret from her not-quite-so-white past, and basically destroy the rare world of illusions that Blanche lugs around with her suitcase. Theirs are two ways of living that can only intersect through a final, horrible act of violence, while Stella and the rest of the characters, (including poor, pathetic Harold Mitchell, Blanche's last hope at a normal life) look on quite helplessly.

It's William's genius that he refuses to make this a story of good versus evil. Instead the forces that crash, tragically, are those of reality and fiction, masculinity and femininity. Blanche is sophisticated, but a wreck. Stanley is down-to-earth, but a brute. They're neither of them good nor bad, but they're alive and scared and unable to live in each other's worlds. 

As Blanche DuBois, Christina Perdomo carries the play. Blanche is a notoriously difficult character: too much, she's laughable; not enough, she's dismissible. Perdomo walks the fine line between too much and not enough, and she walks it finely, with a dramatic flair that somehow suits her role, and a Southern accent that, although not altogether convincing, is thankfully understated.

As Stanley Kowalski, Michael Nunez wisely chooses to walk away from the Marlon Brando impersonation so many other productions favor, (although I am yet to hear a cry of "Stellaaaa!" that doesn't take me right back to Brando's iconic yell.) Nunez plays Stanley with absolutely no theatrical refinement; you half-expect him to pick his nose during the big monologues, and that's, of course, exactly why his role works so well. He brings a casual brutality to the character that justifies some of the tougher, more violent aspects of the play.

Stella, played by Olga Christodoulou, and Harold Mitchell, Kristian Cardenas, are both delights, both characters suggesting the balance that Blanche and Stanley are not able to achieve. They round up a strong supporting cast that reminds us why "A Streetcar Named Desire" is an unforgettable ride.

Headline: Satisfying "Chamber" follows Potter's exploits
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
When "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" opened last year, it was instantly heralded by many as a classic, a film as great as the book it was based upon. It was smart and funny and entertaining, but not afraid to be dark and scary and foreboding. The only complaint was that the film seemed to lack a bit of the magic that made the book so loved by audiences. But, because this was the first film and everything was new, that magic was replaced by awe at the splendor that had been captured on film.

Now that "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" has rolled around, the awe is gone. Audiences know what Quidditch looks like. They've already met and fallen in love with Harry, Ron and Hermione. The "how-will-they-do-that" has been replaced with the "what-are-the-going-to-do-now." 

It's a tribute to the talents of the cast and crew that "Chamber of Secrets" is so enjoyable and inviting, without anything to replace the magic never present in the first film.

On Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there is something foul attacking the students, leaving them in a petrified state. There is word that a monster hiding within the school is to blame, let loose by whomever is the heir of Salazar Slytherin, one of the founders of the school. 

Unfortunately for Harry, extenuating circumstances point fingers to Harry's friend Hagrid, or worse still, Harry himself. With the help of quick-thinking and a little magic, Harry and his friends try to solve the puzzle and save the school before someone gets killed.

"Chamber of Secrets," by far the weakest of the Potter novels, is nevertheless an entertaining romp through a fun-filled fantasy world. But what in the novel is a crisp mystery, full of the unknown and inviting the reader to solve along with Harry, on film it holds nothing more than a dull cacophony of clues. 

Only readers of the novel can watch "Chamber of Secrets" and pick up the important lines, images and moments, because they already know the answer at the end.

As much as you look at the movie and try to strip it down to its essentials though, it's hard to find anything truly wrong with the film. 

There are however lots of tiny little flaws picking away at the goodness within. 

For example, Quidditch is treated like a centerpiece spectacle, placed smack dab in the middle of the movie as a bridge to carry the audience from the early car chase until the action-packed finale over two hours later.

Minor characters that usually add much to the humor of the story are reduced to such insignificant levels, they're nothing more than a fictional character cameo. Screenwriter Steven Kloves believes that the heart of Harry Potter lies in the heroic trio (Harry, Ron, Hermione) and that outside of them, the only characters who truly deserve screen time in this movie are Headmaster Dumbledore, Hagrid and Professor Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Brannagh, hamming it up in ways that would make Shakespeare faint). Instead, what Kloves is doing is whittling away at the huge fantasy world readers of the books enjoy diving into. 

It's ultimately an issue of adapting a 300-page children's novel into at two hour, forty minute movie, and while Kloves does it with admirable aplomb, there's a point where you begin wishing he wouldn't insert every little subplot and give us more character interactions in their place.

Despite its length, "Chamber of Secrets" is ten times brisker than its predecessor. 

Hitting those credits (which if you stay until the end offers one final moment with Lockhart), it's hard to believe that you were waiting for the trailers to begin three hours prior. The movie never slows down, guaranteeing fans a lot of Potter for their money's worth. 

In the end though, "Chamber of Secrets" feels like another Harry Potter adventure rather than a continuation of the Harry Potter storyline. It's almost as if the franchise is already past its prime and just going through the motions now.

Then again, with Alfonso Cuaron, the guy who directed the sex-laden foreign flick "Y Tu Mama Tambien," taking over the reigns from Chris Columbus, who knows what kind of adventures we can expect from the gang in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"?

Headline: Osterman searches for meaning through art
Author: Perry Athanason
&nbsp;
Local artist Mark Osterman offers meaning through his representations of the physical world colliding with the commercial world. Born and raised in New York City, Osterman attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan then went on to New York University where he earned his Masters of Arts from the School of Education. 

Somewhere in that time period, something clicked within him and he channeled his energies into developing an acute sense of awareness for the environment that surrounded him. Since that time, Osterman has become one of Miami's most interesting and perceptually brilliant undiscovered talents. 

He's also the coordinator of education at the Wolfsonian Museum in Miami, Adjunct Faculty Member at Miami Dade Community College, and has worked as an art consultant for several media companies. Osterman also takes an interest in the early introduction of children to art. 

He has devoted a lot of his time as an art instructor at the 92nd Street YMCA in Manhattan and the Montessori School of Brooklyn Heights. 

Q. When did you first realize that you were artistically talented?

A. It wasn't until my last year in grad school working with a professor named Arnold Mesthes. The work I was doing with him really showed me what it was to be an artist and what the point of doing art was, the relative way to create art and the endless possibilities of what it is to be an artist.

Q. Which piece of art that you've created means the most to you and why?

A.  I couldn't choose one; it's more or less the process. The process is using collage to develop paintings that basically stem from an idea, at least what I've gathered, back in the day you had impressionist and artist vibing off of the environment, people, and going out and painting whatever their world was. I started to realize this idea in my own environment and how I grew up with television, magazines, etc. That my actual world and environment was of images, articles and words and by taking those and juxtaposing them gave me some form of power and that was a way for me to express what I thought was a modern environment.

Q. You had mentioned in a recent press release that, "in this environment the commercial image has become an instrument of cultural power." How do you feel about the commercialization of art?

A. I feel that today the lines between art and commercialism or the lines between art and design are completely blurred. I don't have that much of a concern with the idea of commercialization too much as long as what's being done is honest and what's backing it up is intelligent. Its reason for being put out there must be more than just persuading somebody to buy something. As long as it doesn't go further than that.

Q. Through which media do you feel most connected within your work?

A. The painting, the physical process of painting. I enjoy painting large not because I think that it would make it worth more money, but I can stand in front of something that's larger than I am and deal with that in terms of space. It's exciting to me. It's basically creating a physical window in the world that didn't exist before that you could actually walk into it. That's sort of where I feel deeply connected personally.

Q. Your first solo exhibition was just last year. How was that exhibition produced and what advice would you give to other artists searching for that first "solo gig"?

A. I ran into a guy who had a long-term involvement in the arts and also film and theater. He was running a Web Design Company in a space that he thought he could turn into a gallery. I took him up on that in a very optimistic way and I think that surprised him. I basically helped him transform this space into a gallery spending all my time,  and he took an interest in my work so we produced this show. In terms of what I would say to other people is to be careful. I got involved with this particular studio, spent a lot of time and physical effort transforming this studio into a gallery and in the end found that the gallery was being used for purposes other than what was intended. Just be careful to what people promise vs. what people actually do.

Q. As a coordinator of educational programs at the Wolfsonian Museum, would you say that there is a strong, growing relationship between the art community and the general populous? Are your ideas of artistic education programs well received from the community?

A. What I deal in isn't so much about introducing art to people in the community, it's more about a way of looking at it in terms of the environment. It's more about a way of building analytical thinking skills. I'm not finding a resistance because what we focus on is the looking aspect not what techniques are used or the artist's stoical aspect. It's trying to use art where the skills that you learn from it you can apply those skills to any subject matter. What I'm interested in is not classic art education which is studio technique and art history, it's something different, it's based on visual literacy.

Q. What do you love about art?

A. It's empowering, it makes you feel that you have the power to shape the environment instead of being a passive viewer of it, which is something that is emphatic in culture instead of just watching television. That kind of empowerment is really rich. I feel that to be an artist is to be aware. It's a very general term and would be difficult to describe, but I think you walk around with an awareness that a majority of the people don't achieve.

Q. You are a graduate from the school of Visual Arts in New York and have obtained your masters from NYU. Why the move to South Florida?

A. That was done because of my wife (laughs). I am still in love with New York. I was born and raised there so I thought it would be good for me to live somewhere else to gain the perspective that New York is where I want to be. Also New York became so expensive that it was untenable for me to live in the physical city, which is where I wanted to be, and when I realized that I could only live in the periphery; I figured I would look for other places to possibly live. Miami has an emerging art scene that has been well documented and written about. So I thought it would be a good culture to check out.

Q. You've done a lot of work with the YMCA and have worked as an art educator at the Brooklyn Heights Montessori School implementing art programs for young children. How important is it for young children to be introduced and allowed to explore the possibilities that art can offer?

A. Art takes into consideration the idea of intuition, problem solving skills, imagination and creativity. If you apply any of those aspects into anything you need to learn such as math, science, ect. It's going to make you a better decision-maker, so working within the context of art makes you a better thinker. Whether you're an artist or not, it's the skills that are inherent within it. You don't need to be an artist, but if you learn through art these other subject areas allow you to become more involved in it.

Q. You've talked about the "odd contrast between advertising interpretation of the world and the world's actual condition." Explain that contrast and how are you inspired by it?

A. I couldn't explain it because it's sort of shocking but it goes back to what I said before about the passivity of most people. In a lot of today's media you can scan from something incredibly relevant and important, whether it be political or some social inequality, and then scan next to it and realize that there is a sale on jeans this weekend. The juxtaposition of these together is jarring but people don't get jarred. What I like to do is take these contrasting images and place them in a piece that will jar people and cause them to think. That's basically why the work is developed from collage. I take ideas or images that seemingly are unrelated and hopefully the viewer will find some type of connection.

Q. How do you manage to jump from the many different roles that you play everyday? From artist to professor, to educational coordinator, to husband and father?

A. It's incredibly difficult. I didn't even do a painting until I was 19. I never even painted before then, but I went through this growth process that I loved to be busy and doing things. I love the idea of growth. My first 18 years I just kind of hung around and watched television. I didn't think anything about my environment or the things happening globally. Now I thrive off of being busy and involved in doing things that I love.  

Q. What projects are you currently working on?

A. With the education I'm involved in a fascinating project which is a department of education grant, one million dollars over the next three years. We are developing a curriculum using primary objects to teach core social studies. We are going to choose objects in the museum that students will analyze and think about. Through that process they will somehow relate to a theme chosen that they study in social studies whether it is geography, world history, economics, citizenship, anything. It's basically this idea of learning through objects and would actually take place in the classroom. It wouldn't be instructed by artist but by teachers teaching how to learn with objects. It's a very challenging project. In terms of art I am still working on collage pieces and an installation piece involving ceramic hands.

Q. You have a pet peeve about placing titles on your work. Why is that?

A. That goes back to the idea that I love for people to think and what happens is that we are in a culture where people expect answers and the obvious. It's the idea of you expect what you pay for. We are in a culture now where people want to be given the answers and don't want to be challenged. The reason I don't like titles is that to me, it's like putting blinders on a horse. You put blinders on a horse in a race so that they run straight and are unaware of what is lateral to them. I find that if you give a title you instantly give a direction for people to think about instead of it being completely subjective for them to draw on their own experiences and histories.

Q. Where can people view your art?

A. I am currently affiliated with the South Florida Art Center as a juried resident artist. The art center has a partnership with Walgreens on Lincoln Road and on Collins Ave. and 74th st. When they constructed these stores they made the front window spaces as little galleries. So I am being shown in a rotation of many different artists from the art center during the dates from November 26 through January 6 in these window galleries.

Headline: "Real Women" observes modern feminity
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
What do you mean you're not a size two? Fat is beautiful. Or at least that is one of the messages conveyed in the film "Real Women Have Curves."  But this concept is incredibly foreign to us. As soon as I saw the lead, Ana (America Ferrera), walking down the street in the movie, I automatically thought to myself: "This is the first time I have ever seen a young, female actress who is overweight. That is unacceptable in Hollywood." This film exalts women of all shapes and sizes. 

Ana is a Mexican-American girl who is finishing high school. Growing up in a traditional Hispanic household is difficult for her as a driven and willful girl, characteristics foreign to her family. Throughout the movie, she constantly struggles with them, as she attempts to evolve and become something different from the traditional and ideal woman her family wants her to be. 

Her battle for independence is the source of the many conflicting values presented between Ana and her Mexican family, especially the love-hate relationship she has with her verbally abusive mother, played by Lupe Ontiveros. Her mother wants her to help out in her sister's garment shop the day after her graduation, while her teacher, Mr. Guzman, believes in her and wants her to go to Columbia University. The director, Patricia Cardoso, makes Mr. Guzman out to be annoyingly fake; or was that his fault for his poor acting skills? He tries too hard and simply sounds lame. What teacher shows up at his student's doorstep – not once, but twice – to try and convince and convince the family to send their child to college? He would be considered a stalker. 

What I really liked about this film was that the other characters were real. Ana portrays a typical, unhappy high school girl: she doesn't really smile (until she starts dating a classmate), barely wears makeup and certainly doesn't care about what she looks like. She is at the age where the soul-searching begins. 

Likewise, the other characters truly depict what it is like to struggle each and every day as members of a traditional Mexican family, and how an American-born girl handles the generational and cultural clashes that occur as a product of non-indigenous parents.

Because the movie depicts events in startlingly real ways, there were moments when my mouth dropped, wondering why Ana wasn't running away from home yet. But then I had to remind myself that the traditional role of a female in certain Hispanic households is a Catch-22: Anna cannot escape the vicious cycle of neglecting an education and leading the conventional female role. Her mother condemns her for shuffling her feet while she walks. After all, women should saunter gracefully. She can't talk to boys, so she uses her grandfather as her alibi for going out on a date. Her own opinions are hardly tolerated. 

What is so poignant is that much of the movie focuses on weight and body image, which is a reality not only in Hispanic families, but in any family. 

Each time her mother mentions how fat she is, Ana argues that there is more to her than her external self. This sounds nice enough, but unfortunately most people in our society could not care less about the internal.

With the progression of the film, I couldn't figure out why it was given the title "Real Women Have Curves." Considering Ana is not yet a woman, and she's the lead, I was perplexed. Then one of the last scenes in the movie gave me my answer. It is an unforgettably enlightening scene, tackling all our issues with body image, and it perfectly illustrates the film's mantra: fat is beautiful.

Headline: We Buy Them, Don't Use Them, Can't Re-sell Them
Subheadline:  
Author: tcamp002@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
It is the beginning of a new semester and you walk into the bookstore to purchase books for your classes.  Unbeknownst to you, each of your classes requires three to four textbooks. By mid semester, after paying at least $100-$150 for these texts, you have only used one of the four.  You go to the bookstore--books sealed and receipt in hand-- and the cashier tells you that the book cannot be returned, because of some lame policy that makes absolutely no sense. Should you wait until the end of the semester, you might be able to resell your book at a loss--five dollars for a book that you spent over seventy-five dollars on. This is appalling.  
If and when we do use these books, we may only be required to read one or two chapters.  Can we come up with a better solution, maybe have copies of these chapters available at the Copy Center, which would cost us much less?  We are willing to take the walk to the Copy Center rather than spend unnecessary dollars. Why should students have to suffer financially at the hand of the 'super professors' who fail to meet their own requirements? 
I am led to believe that the use of textbooks in educational institutions is for the sole purpose of making money rather than imparting knowledge.  When, as students, we are told by professors that our books will not be repurchased by the bookstore because a new edition has come out, what are we supposed to do?  I find this to be very unfair, considering that a 'new edition' is a reshuffling of the same chapters. 
It is time for universities to focus their attention on education, rather than 'draining' our pockets. After all don't we deserve to get what we are paying for?

Yours truly,
Terrianne Campbell

Headline: Hayek faithfully portrays "Frida"
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
The controversy about the unibrow, the catty divas and the endless production is over.  After some serious drama for your mama, the movie "Frida" is finally out in theaters.  Although I was a little skeptical about how accurate or fair a Hollywood version of Frida Kahlo's life would be, the movie really came across as an honest tribute to the artist who revolutionized Mexican culture and art. 

Frida is, indeed, a very real and deep character, and portraying her requires nothing less than raw performing talent.  This is exactly what Salma Hayek delivers.  In fact, her portrayal of Frida captures all aspects of the artist, from her strong sexuality, to her revolutionary political spirit.  Aside from the physical resemblance, Hayek is really convincing. 

The story of the woman who was more than just a woman, and her womanizing, lifetime companion, Diego Rivera, played by actor Alfred Molina, fills the big screen with every conflict one can possibly think of.  Adultery, the rising struggle of the proletariat in Mexico, miscarriages, bisexuality, death, accidents, betrayal, loyalty towards ethical values and ideologies and endless passion – this movie has it all.

Director Julie Taymor does a good job at illustrating the strong theme of nationalism that drove both Frida and Diego to uphold the elements of their own culture. One truly gets a sense of the Mexican culture, and by that I don't mean that it makes you want to take five shots of José Cuervo and sing rancheras, although some of the scenes will have that effect on you. Cartoon-like scenes filled with skeletons and fantasy thoughts illustrate Kahlo's own comical style when crossing the line between reality and surrealism, as she so often did in her work.

Funny lines will hit you left and right and the comedic element is a strong one throughout the script.  Ashley Judd, who interprets the attractive Italian photographer, Tina Modotti, certainly gets her share of comedy in the anti-marriage, communist speech she delivers during her short performance.  The rest of the cast includes Edward Norton as Nelson Rockefeller, Antonio Banderas as David Alfaro Sisqueros and Mia Maestro as Cristina Kahlo.  

Even though their performances are relatively short, it is nice to have such an experienced group of good actors deliver the few lines, which certainly bring magic to the plot.  

This is especially true in the scenes between Frida and Lupe Marin, Diego's first wife, played by the beautiful actress Valeria Golino.

The movie's communist theme, however, drags for a while and Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush), spends way too much time talking about Lenin.  Nevertheless, Trotsky was a very significant person in both Frida's and Diego's lives, so a few minutes would not do justice to Trotsky's genuine, sustained influence on the lives of Rivera and Kahlo.

Salma Hayek, like Kahlo, comes across as a very courageous woman and we see this in several of the scenes that depict sexual encounters with other women.  

Overall, I was satisfied with how the movie gives Frida to the world, with all her passion and all her controversy.  One walks away knowing that Frida was more than just some hairy, Mexican woman, who also happened to paint. One walks away inspired by Frida Kahlo's passion and dedication.

Headline: Latin rock sways Miami crowds
Author: Angela Castillo
&nbsp;
Miami's Latin community had the pleasure to enjoy the first-ever Bud Light "Rock en Miami" festival Nov. 10th at Bayfront Park Amphitheater. The festival was held in tribute to the growth of Latin Rock culture in South Florida. 

The 12 hour festival welcomed about 25 bands, both international and local. Latin rock resonated everywhere in Downtown, and people whose only mission was to flap the flags from their own countries were more than excited to sing the gummy lyrics from Los Rabanes (Panama), Pedro Suarez-Vertiz (Peru), el Tri (Mexico), Los Piojos, La Mosca Tsé Tsé and Ráfaga (Argentina). 

Although the last band just mentioned was an oddity since its genre is pure cumbia, people had a good time singing the lyrics and grabbing either a known or unknown person's hand just to feel the tropical rhythm in their bodies. 

That evening, Bayfront Park was no longer an amphitheater, but a stadium where a soccer game was taking place. Mexican Chihuahua hats and Argentinean soccer t-shirts were the rule of distinction of the night between "vatos" and "chés." All of them, including a few Peruvians, were chanting cheers encouraging the different band members to interact with the crowd. Cheers went from a simple "I love you Mexico/Argentina" to a well-developed one like "olé olé olá, cada dia te quiero más, shoooo soy de la Argentina." ("I love you more every day, I'm from Argentina") The lines for "Fernét," the most common and strong alcoholic beverage for Argentineans, were incredibly longer than the one to get "Budweiser" beer, which ironically was the main sponsor of the festival. 

Concertgoers had the chance to taste some of their favorite plates from their respective countries as well as to buy some of their handmade crafts. Hats and shirts were given away during the intermission. 

By the time Los Piojos were announced, the seats were about to collapse from all the euphoric jumping. The crowd did not stop singing at the top of their lungs the song called "Maradó," dedicated to Diego Armando Maradona, the second most famous soccer star of South America, (after Pelé). Los Piojos performed longer than expected due to the petition of the crowd to sing one more song, which actually became three. Before leaving, Los Piojos thanked the Argentinean crowd and promised them to come back next year. 	

The time for the Mexican rock n' rollers came and Argentineans got peacefully barred by the Mexican crowd, which was so full of spirit and positive energy that they built a "human tower" out of three people. The person on top was holding and flapping a huge flag that dominated the view of the entire place. The last band of the night was el Tri. The vocalist of the band asked the crowd: "Donde esta la raza? Vamos a pasarla bien chido hijo!" ("Where are my people? We're gonna have a great time, son!") The Mexican people and the few Peruvians, Panamanians and Hondurans joined the chorus of what was a top track song in the radio back in the '90s, it is called "Canción de Amor," ("Love Song") and it's probably the most melancholic song people heard at the festival. 

El Tri was probably the band the crowd identified with the most, because its lyrics let everyone realize the crude reality of being poor, unemployed and surrounded by violence. Alex Lora and the other members of el Tri said good-bye to the crowd by saying "Que viva el rock n' roll" ("Long live rock and roll") and an inevitable rain of cheers followed. 

"The Rock en Miami" festival was good enough, considering it was the first one, (although hopefully not the last one). The festival has shown that Latin music has power in the lyrics, in the rhythms and in the inspirational message, that is finally being recognized and accepted worldwide. The festival has promised to be an annual event that will offer music to every community as well as to push the underground local bands to a higher level of acceptance.

Headline: Asorey leads men's soccer on and off the field
Author: Daisy Fernández/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team at FIU has made an incredible turnaround this season. After losing its first four matches, it has upgraded itself to a team that owns 13 wins. The efforts of midfielder/forward Matias Asorey have helped bring the team this far.     

This 22 year-old senior was born in Argentina, but came to the United States at a young age. By watching his older brother and his friends, Asorey began playing soccer when he was ten years old. He competed at Miami Sunset High School, where he led the Knights with 64 goals and 57 assists in four years. In his junior and senior years, he was chosen for the All-Dade soccer team. Asorey was the leading scorer in the county and holds the record for the most goals ever made at Sunset.   

He expanded his athletic career by joining the AAU Strike Force. Some of his teammates in Strike Force are now playing for the MLS. 

According to Asorey, his most memorable goal was made for this soccer club in 1997. He shot a goal that sent the team to the National Championships, an experience he will he never forget.   

Before coming to FIU in 1999, Asorey attended St. Thomas for a year. He is happy to have made it here. He believes "the athletics program at FIU has a lot of advantages. It offers many programs academically-wise. If you have a problem, most of the staff will go out of its way to help you. Whereas in a bigger school, you wouldn't be able to talk to them."   

Asorey has been honored on numerous levels while at FIU. He was named Atlantic Soccer Conference Player of the Year in 2001, when he helped FIU earn a 10-6-0 record. In addition to aiding his team, Asorey recorded 8 goals on 60 shots for the Golden Panthers. This year he has recorded 13 goals for the Golden Panthers. 

However, Asorey's talents reach beyond the field as well. "At times, I've helped the team by securing games. But I think I've also helped with my experience. Since there are a lot of young guys, I try to keep the team together," said Asorey. 

When asked how far FIU soccer will go this year, Asorey responded, "We should go to sweet sixteen this year. But depending on how well we play, we can go all the way." 

Asorey spent this last summer in Lima, Peru where he trained with a professional South American team called Alianza. "This was an eye-opening experience for me. The players were incredibly talented and skillful, and at the same time they were only getting paid 60 dollars a month."

Asorey is a sociology major and is looking forward to graduating from FIU in the Spring of 2002. 

Like many hopeful athletes, Asorey would like to play at the next level. "After I graduate, I want to try to play professionally. If that doesn't work out, I'll start looking for a job."

His advice for other athletes who want to make it big is this: "Work hard and leave your mark. It is important [to make] a name for yourself. Before you know it, four years have flown by, and what's left of your playing years are your stats ."

For now Asorey is practicing over 15 hours a week. With this dedication, he hopes to leave the FIU soccer team with a national championship. And who knows…maybe some day we will see this promising athlete in the MLS.

Headline: Religious fanaticism causes tunnel vision
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
I don't think I like organized religion anymore. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against religious fanatics. Some of my best friends are religious fanatics. I care about the welfare of my eternal soul, and keep shrines to all of the major gods.

But there's just something about it that's starting to sound creepy to me. And I owe it all to one girl. 

About two weeks ago, a group of apparently holy Christian kids invaded the Graham Center in an effort to preach to the rest of us repulsive sinners. Long lines were formed around these kids because, apparently, they were giving out free pizza as long as you swore your allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ.

That's right. Free pizza. If only the Christian martyrs had thought about this, things would have played very differently with the Romans: "Augustus, we could feed the Christians to the lions, or we could join them and get free pizza!" "By Jove, Optimus, let's convert to Christianity immediately!"

There I was in the GC pit, and this girl, questionnaire in hand, offered to give me a slice of pizza in exchange for my soul. Naturally, I was intrigued by this proposition, but I didn't want to sell myself cheap, so she added a can of Diet Coke as part of the bargain.

Basically I would have to answer a few questions about my sinful ways, say a healing prayer, and receive a ticket for my free pizza, which I thought was a fair enough deal until the questions began. I found the questions to be slightly slanted: "Do you go to Church, or do you stay at home and worship Satan instead?" "Do you think Christ was the Son of God, or are you worthless vermin that will rot in Hell forever and ever, amen?"

At first, I played nice, but then I answered a question by saying that I was 90 percent sure I was going to heaven. (I'm also five percent sure I'm gonna be re-incarnated as a Ferris wheel, and 5 percent sure there is no heaven, but I wasn't going to tell her that.) Her bemused eyebrow suggested she wasn't so sure about my chances, so I couldn't help but ask her what she thought her chances were. Of course, she was going to heaven 100 percent, and she made a helpful diagram explaining why God despised me.

And then she crossed the line. She began downright bullying me, and told me that, no matter how good I thought I was, I would still be infinitely bad in the eyes of God, who apparently despises humanity a hell of a lot more than I'd thought, because none of us can ever be perfect. 

I thought of saying: "Mary Poppins was practically perfect in every way," but then she would have said: " Mary Poppins is a fictional character," and then I would have said: "Yes, so is a priest who's not into little boys," but that wouldn't have gotten us very far.

Instead, I committed the biggest sin you can commit when dealing with a religious fanatic: I quoted the Bible. Twice.

I first told her that Christ exhorted us all to be perfect, that He literally said: "Be perfect." At this point her eyes glazed over, and she said: "Christ did not say that. That's not in the Bible." I assured her He did, (it's in Matthew 5:47) and offered to look it up for her in the Bible. She didn't have one. Irony of ironies, I did; I usually carry a New Testament around. She refused to look at it, because according to her, "God would never say that, because we can never be perfect. And that's that."

It's a minor, fairly trivial theological point, but it's so scary that she wouldn't even listen simply because it would interfere with the programming in her head. I thought she was interested in the word of God, and then suddenly she doesn't care what Christ says? What's the story here?

She then asked me to pray with her right there in the middle of GC &#8211; show my fellow students that real men love Jesus. I looked around me, saw all the holy Christian kids luring hungry kids in for a prayer, and I was genuinely scared. I felt trapped in the middle of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," except these folks were after my soul.

I refused to pray, and I told her why. Because this Salvation-and-a-slice-of-pizza deal was blasphemous. Because only hypocrites pray in public. Because true Christians go home, and pray where no one can see them. Because Christ said so. (Matthew 6: 5-7)

Castro's regime mistreats Africans, Afro-Cubans

To the editor:

Fidel Castro has held absolute power for over four decades. From the start, Castro reached out to African Americans by checking out of his midtown New York hotel and into the Theresa Hotel in Harlem, meeting with Malcolm X in the process. 

Castro's courtship of African American leadership has been primarily symbolism over substance.

Castro's policies in Africa were based on geopolitical calculations to serve Soviet and Cuban interests. He did not see the plight of Africans as a problem that needed to be overcome, but rather as an opportunity to be seized to advance his own interests.

One of the deeds Castro wants to keep hidden is Cuba's role in the mass killings in Ethiopia in the 1970s and 1980s. Beginning in 1977, over 17,000 Cuban military personnel arrived in Ethiopia. Between 1977 and 1978, over 30,000 Africans perished as a result of the Red Terror unleashed by the Ethiopian Communists and their Cuban allies. 

Amnesty International concluded, "This campaign resulted in several thousand to perhaps tens of thousands of men, women and children killed, tortured and imprisoned." 

Sweden's Save the Children Fund lodged a formal protest in early 1978, denouncing the execution of 1,000 children, many below the age of 13, whom the communist government had labeled "liaison agents of the counter revolutionaries."

During the 1984-85 famine in northern Ethiopia, which shocked the world and led to the 1985 "Live Aid" concert, Castro's troops, following the lead of their ally, worsened the starvation by refusing to allow food distribution in areas where inhabitants were sympathetic to opposition groups and engaging in a policy of "forcibly resettling people." According to an international medical group as many as 100,000 Africans died.

And how have Cubans of African descent fared under Castro's regime? 

Only one white Cuban male (Fidel Castro) has the final decision on government policy.

Black Panther William Lee Brent, a U.S. fugitive now living in Cuba, fled there hoping that they had found the "antidote to racism." He discovered that Cuban blacks still suffer racism but no longer have the freedom to speak about it openly. "If a Cuban raises his voice to say, 'I am being discriminated against because I am black,' then he would be labeled a dissident," Brent said. 

Cuban blacks, along with the rest of the Cuban people, do not have the right to their own opinion.

Republicans further discrimination against Haitian immigrants

To the editor:

Kudos to the Republicans and for our state: the election seemed to have gone smooth here in Florida. However, I am a Democrat and I will not refrain from expressing my disappointment in Bush being re-elected and the Republicans gaining control of Congress; this is especially due to the fact that I am Haitian-American. 

It is, and has been for a very long time, apparent that Haitians seeking political asylum by risking their lives and coming to this country by boat face tremendous animosity from government and federal officials. This seems to be even more noticeable when republicans are, point blank "in session" – be it the state having a republican governor, the country being led by a GOP and/or when Congress is dominated by this party affiliation. 

It is unnerving that the media, because of these particular politicians, associate danger and terrorism with Haitians – all of a sudden there is a need to protect the United States' coastal borders. Yet what is even more appalling in this ordeal is the large number of Haitian citizens living in South Florida who do little to help their brothers and sisters. 

The protests, which seem to be situated only in North Miami, are not enough. The Haitian community does not only include those living in Little Haiti and the North Miami area; Kendall, Miramar, Ft. Lauderdale, Cutler Ridge and especially West Kendall abound with these communities. 

Marlen Bastien seems to be the only person making rounds to Krome Detention center to help the detained individuals. I'm certain that there are other people helping in this matter, but they need to come out to the forefront. State Representative Philip Brutus, newly elected State Representative Yolly Robinson and North Miami Mayor Joe Celestin have to fight for the people who put them in office. 

Ms. Robinson was described in the Miami Herald as being media-shy. In my opinion, if is, then she should have never run for office. Celestin's political affiliation is also upsetting. He sold out the Haitian community because he is not lifting one finger to help with this situation. 

When I went home and found NBC 6 reporting on the 200 Haitians jumping into the bay, I immediately logged on the internet to contact the Haitian Student Union here at FIU. This is not the first time I have contacted them only to receive no response. Even more troubling, I could not find their homepage through the school's site. That is a shame. 

The time has come for us as a people to unite and help one another. One person's voice alone cannot do this (in reference to Ms. Bastien). Just as the Cuban community united to protest Elian's 5 a.m. raid two and a half years ago, we need to show our outrage in the treatment of our people. If this means going on strike at work, protesting in the streets of South Florida and writing to Haitian-American politicians to get the message heard, then this is all worth it. We should never forget our roots: it could have been us in that boat and at Krome.

Headline: Administration needs to be  forthcoming on student issues
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Many Biscayne Bay Campus housing students relied on the Panther Prowler as their main source of transportation.  The shuttle was their lifeline, their way of getting around North Miami.

However, the bus has been out of service for two months and no one is willing to give students an explanation for the outage. 

When SGC President Adrian Carter asked Dr. Brian Haynes, the assistant vice president of student affairs at BBC, to a Bay Vista Hall Council meeting, Haynes did not show up. This is a clear example of the administration showing a lack of respect for students' needs. 

What the administration fails to realize is that they are accountable to the students. Our fees help fund the Panther Prowler and other services some administrators apparently feel are random acts of kindness to students. 

When The Beacon attempted to reach Haynes and other members of the administration for answers, even more questions arose. The only consistent answers are that the shuttle was involved in two "minor accidents" and that the university is now performing a search to hire a driver with a commercial license.

It is strange and unacceptable that simple information such as the driver's name, the present location and status of the shuttle and the name of its insurance company were not disclosed. 

Though even fender-benders can be a hassle and take time to resolve and dealing with insurance companies introduces many delays, it seems unlikely that a bus can be kept out of service for two months due to a "minor" accident.

One possible solution is that SGA form a committee to investigate this issue and similar incidents in the future.  

If the administration knows that they have a risk of being investigated for their mistakes, it will foster a greater sense of accountability and force them to be more forthcoming with information.  

None of the services provided in the university are free, students pay for them whether directly or indirectly.  We pay the administration to be here and they have an obligation to provide students with information regarding changes in these services, especially those that affect their daily lives.

Headline: Policies treat Haitians unfairly
Author: Tracey Bessard
&nbsp;
I understand why Haitians leave their impoverished country. I understand why they pay a fee between $1,000 and $3,000 to board a boat packed with about 200 other people and take a long, risky ride at sea. What I can't understand is why Haitians are thrown into jails like criminals.  

The Haitians who arrived in Miami Beach on Oct. 29 were detained in jails after reaching shore. When they realized the Coast Guard had spotted them, many of them leapt overboard and swam to shore. 

To apply for political asylum in the United States, an undocumented immigrant has only to touch dry land. But the Haitians' attempts did not end there. They ran onto Rickenbacker Causeway catching rides with anyone that would stop for them in order to get away from officials. 

Miami has been a new start for many immigrants. With their families and friends already living in Miami, they seek a life that is better than the life they lived in their country. 

But how can they start a new life in jail? More importantly, why are they even in jail? Haitian immigrants are not criminals.  

Why are Haitians being singled out and treated unfairly? In November 1997, Congress passed the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, which granted legal permanent residency to Central Americans. Though their situation is similar to the groups who are covered by this act, Haitians were not included. 

A policy was passed in December 2001 that orders that all Haitian asylum seekers who arrive by boat be placed in detention centers until it can be proven that they fear for their lives if they are sent back to Haiti. The policy was passed after a group of 187 Haitians, who came to Florida by boat on Dec. 3, 2001, were taken into custody.  They are still being held in detention centers to this day. 

The government states that they want to prevent a mass migration from Haiti to the United States. They concluded that only way to prevent that from occurring is to detain Haitians who seek asylum indefinitely. This is supposed to deter other Haitians from attempting to make the risky voyage to South Florida.

It sounds like they really care about what happens to them, but I doubt it. If that were the case, then this policy would apply to all nationalities that make the same risky voyage to the United States on these jam-packed, worn-down boats.

Race is a possible reason why Haitian immigrants are treated differently from those of other nationalities. 

The unfair treatment of Haitians should not be present in a society that boasts equality and fairness. No one should be thrown into jail because they want a better life. Everyone wants and dreams of a better life.  If that is a crime, then we all belong in jail with the Haitians.

Headline: Youth vote has power to swing politicians' priorities
Author: Jason Andreasen
&nbsp;
"I am not going to vote because the politicians seem to care about nobody but wealthy, old people."

This is the worst, most intellectuallybankrupt, idiotic form of political protest ever attempted. In most instances, it is nothing but an excuse.

Two weeks ago, the front page of The Beacon featured a graphic showing that 71 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds griped about how politicians preferred to cater to older, wealthier people. That shows us all just how disaffected the youth have become with politics. So the question arises: How do we fix it? Well, in order to understand the problem, we must first recognize the players in the game.

Most of the time politicians act so that they can be re-elected. 

As younger voters, we do not have as much at stake as most older or middle-aged voters. This can be seen with the dominant issues every election: K-12 education, Social Security and gun control. By and large, we have no children in public schools, we're not receiving Social Security checks and we aren't the majority of the gun carriers in the country. Thus, many young people don't vote.

Why are these the issues? The reason that the legalization of marijuana, the drinking age, and questions about higher education don't get major attention during campaigns is precisely because we don't vote. 

It is almost counter-productive for politicians to include the 18- to 24-year-old demographic in their campaign. As a politician, it's not smart to waste your time catering to an entire demographic that won't vote.  While you are doing that, your opponent is  catering to middle-aged voters and seniors, increasing support that will actually prove fruitful. 

Now, I'm sure that some would say that  politicians should make the effort to appeal to everybody, including the younger voter. Hey, if there is any room for me in that utopia you live in, let me know. Politicians look at campaigning like a business, doing cost-benefit analyses constantly. It does not benefit them to listen to us. We have to make our opinions and collective vote mean something. 

If we don't vote, we will be the losers. The politicians will get elected and re-elected, and we will be ignored. 

Allow me to paint a different picture. In countries like Australia, the 18- to 24-year-old vote is significant. Then again, this is because voting is mandated by law in Australia. This is not a good route to take. How about the voting in Iraq or Cuba? In these countries, not only do you have to vote, but you have to vote for a particular person. 

You would think this would instill a certain degree of patriotism in us that would drive us to the polls. Not so. Then after 9/11, with all the American flags waving from our cars, you would think that there would be lines around the block to vote. Nope. 

The politicians do not want us to vote. If we, as a demographic, were to turn out in record numbers next election, politicians would wet themselves. They have gotten their game down to a tee. They know whom they need to talk to and how much they need to talk. We do not fit in that scheme. 

But, if we vote, we introduce a lot of new voices into the voting public. This would throw off their scheme. You see, politicians have everything to gain and nothing to lose from us not voting. 

 But what have we lost? The complacency of the 18- to 24-year-olds is what allows 18-year-olds to be drafted for World War III, but when they come home, prevents them from getting a beer. Their indifference, in part, is what allows 20-year mandatory jail terms for possession of small amounts of marijuana. 

We have to go vote. We have to go out and make them listen. The reason that politicians listen to the old and wealthy people is because they make their opinions matter. The next time you hear someone complain about politicians not listening to the young people of America, ask them if they voted. If they did, then listen. If they didn't, do just what the politicians do: Walk away and talk to someone who did. Eventually, they'll get the hint.

Headline: University favors organizations over students
Author: Brandy Swartz
&nbsp;
Last week, as the Scientologists wandered the first floor of the Wolfe University Center at Biscayne Bay Campus soliciting students, I came up with a brilliant idea. I walked over to the information desk and asked if I could sit at one of the two empty tables and hand out anonymous surveys for a class project.

The girl at the desk said that I needed to go to WUC 325 and ask Jennifer Cooper, the associate director of scheduling operations and events, because the tables were usually reserved for vendors. I argued that they weren't being used, but she said I still needed permission.

I entered WUC 325 and spoke with Jessica Reyes, Cooper's personal assistant.  I told Reyes that I wanted to sit at an empty table downstairs to have students fill out a survey for class. 

Reyes asked what group I was with.

I replied, "I'm not with a group.  I'm a full-time FIU student who needs help filling out surveys for a homework assignment."

Her response was not pleasing.  Apparently, the tables (empty or not) are reserved for vendors and if I wanted to use one, I needed to be with a group or pay $30 as an individual.

I tried another approach.  I asked if I could go outside and just ask students to fill out a survey. Reyes said that would be considered soliciting and I could be escorted off campus by  security.

I was disappointed that a controversial religious organization had been monopolizing the area for a week, and I couldn't even hand out surveys for a class.

One woman in the office suggested that I go to the University Park campus instead because they were more lax with solicitors.

I went to see the professor who'd given the assignment and ran into Mike McQueen, chair of the Department of Journalism and Broadcasting, and told him what had happened.  He suggested that I petition the research department for permission to do my survey on campus, but that would probably take two to three weeks.

I stomped back up to WUC 325 and ended up speaking with Cooper.  She reaffirmed everything her assistant had said, but also added that the $30 did not include tax.  The total would be $31.95 to sit at a table.

I'm sure that the Scientologists paid more than $30 to be in the school, but it bothers me that they were granted the right. 

I know that schools are bureaucracies like everything else, but I'm finding it hard to swallow that I can be solicited by Scientologists but can't ask fellow students to help me with my homework. Of course getting my homework done required soliciting, but it was for no ends other than research.

Headline: Students mourn death, celebrate life
Author: Sara Henderson
&nbsp;
Students and faculty of FIU's inaugural law class mourn the loss of one of their brightest, Dean Leonard Strickman said.

A memorial service is scheduled to honor Enma Tarafa, law student and recipient of the Akerman-Senterfitt Scholarship.

Tarafa, her boyfriend and FIU alumnus Fernando Gil, Jr. and Gil's parents, Fernando Sr. and Miriam Gil were killed in a fiery, one-car crash Nov. 8. 

"It appears that the Jaguar vehicle was being driven southbound on S.W. 127th Avenue at a high rate of speed. The driver, for unknown reasons, appears to have lost control and drove the vehicle into a concrete wall," Miami-Dade Police said.

Police say one of the men was ejected from the vehicle and was pulled from the burning car by an area resident. Both female victims died in the flaming vehicle.

Michelle Mason, assistant law dean, is spearheading the organization of a memorial service scheduled for Nov. 20 at 5 p.m. in GL 100. "We thought it would be important to celebrate her life," Mason said.

"The very first class is very close, and I think [her death] cried out for recognition," Strickman said.

Tarafa is fondly remembered. "She was hard working and well liked by her classmates," Strickman said.

Mason agreed. "Enma was very well-known and liked. She had not only intellectual gift, but she was a kind person. She always had a smile on her face."

Tarafa's close friends and roommate were contacted but were not available for comment.

Biscayne Bay

WEDNESDAY – Hank Schramm, Director of Student Lobbing, talked about the disparity between the state's universities budget allocation. FIU receives less per credit hour than any of the other 11 universities in Florida. Schramm is working with the People for the American Way, and Project Youth Vote to further expand the voice of FIU. 

President Carter explained the two ways our tuition could be raised by the Board of Governors. The Board of Governors could increase tuition statewide by a certain percentage or it could leave the percentage increase up to the Board of Trustees to decide the amount. At that point the SGC would like to have a half student committee that would be directly involved with the Trustees in the decision making process. Carter stressed the importance to the newer members in getting the student voice involved in the committee. 

Vice President Alexander Lewy, who sits on the Traffic Advisory Board's monthly meetings said the board approved the price increase from $ .75 to $1 per hour on the parking meters located at both campuses. To help alleviate traffic problems the board recommended taking some of the excess Faculty parking at BBC and converting it into student parking. 

Lewy is also working on getting FIU students reduced rates for riders of the Metro Transit System. 

 Carter stressed his concerns with the apathy expressed by students in the previous elections where seats still remain unoccupied on the Council. Carter said it is important for the new and old members to work hard to not become frustrated and achieve their individual goals.

WEDNESDAY – President Jessica Morffi encouraged students and SGC members to participate in the fun of "friendly rivalry" by attending the first FIU vs. FAU game on Saturday, November 23 at Pro Player Stadium. She talked to FAU's student president who was also excited about the upcoming game.

Shortly before Wednesday's SGC meeting, the Board of Trustees had their last meeting of the 2002 year. Morffi, a board member, said the next January meeting will likely be with a board comprised of different people. Morffi said around Jan. 7, 2003, the new board will be announced. The specifics are not clear yet about which kinds of changes will be taking place. 

At that same Board meeting, a masters of liberal arts was approved for the university.

Morffi reminded students that they are welcome to attend both the monthly Board of Trustees meetings.

Vice President Omar Castillo reported that, while students weren't enthusiastic enough regarding the previous week's Campaign Days, the drive was a success. Five hundred and thirty five surveys were completed. On scale of "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree," most students "agree" that University Park SGC members are approachable, have a strong presence on campus, and keep the students best interests in mind. 

Medina also announced the top five campus complaints. The No. 1 issue was campus parking. Bookstore prices, tuition, student fees, food court prices followed close behind.

Three chairs were filled in a special election last week. Stefanie Cabrera was approved into the College of Education Representative position. Cynthia Fraga was elected to the position of Elections Chairperson and Alejandra Cordovez  was elected to Student Services Chairperson.

Headline: Psychiatrist now available on campus
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
An on-campus psychiatrist is giving students more treatment options at the Counseling and Psychological Services Center. Dr. Samuel Roura is the latest addition to the center's staff.

Psychiatrists such as Roura are allowed to prescribe medications. Psychiatrists go on to complete a medical residency after earning a medical degree.

Psychologists, on the other hand, still earn doctorate degrees but cannot prescribe medication.

"Whenever there is a suspected need of additional services such as medication, patients may be referred to me," Dr. Samuel Roura said. "The new services are more focused on whatever symptoms are causing stress or impairment," said Roura. "This includes anything from anxiety, depression, adjustment problems, relationship problems and culture shock to more serious psychosis paranoia and substance abuse." 

"The contracted services are primarily for those students who need such services but do not have insurance," Dr. Cheryl Nowell, Counseling and Psychological Services Center director, said. 

Students seem genuinely open to the idea of seeing a trained psychiatrist about their problems.

"Having a psychiatrist on campus will benefit the students by providing time efficiency and reducing absenteeism, which should also benefit the psychiatrist financially," Fawad Kabiri, biology, senior,  said. 

Eduardo Pazos, sophomore, agreed. "I don't hold any archaic beliefs that psychotherapy is only for nutcases."

"I'd feel more comfortable with a psychiatrist because he's better trained and is more likely to be able to help me," Miguel Velasquez, international relations, freshman, said. 

In the past, students with psychological problems would normally see one of the 10 psychologists employed by the university. Students with more serious problems would be referred to Roura at his private office.

Now students have a choice between seeing him on campus or at his office.

"Deciding whether to see me here on campus or at my office is based on scheduling and convenience," Roura said. 

"We consistently received positive feedback from students and staff regarding the quality of services Dr. Roura provided and thus he was our first choice for a contracted provider to be present on campus," Nowell said. "He sits down with, listens and talks to students." 

Although she intends to increase his number of hours at the university next semester, funding currently prevents  Nowell from keeping him here for a longer period of time each week, she said. 

Dr. Roura completed his residency at Jackson Memorial Hospital over a decade ago, specializing in adult psychiatry with a subspecialty in adolescent and child psychiatry. 

Some of the services he offers along with his associates at his practice, Doctors and Associates, include counseling for groups, couples and individuals, training for controlled birth, therapeutic martial arts, yoga, and a Far Eastern ancient energy management technique known as "reike".

"My office uses a holistic approach," Roura said. "[There] I offer hypnotherapy and neurofeedback as some of the treatment modalities besides classical therapy and medication management.

"Our staff includes psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, mental health counselors, hypnotherapists and neurofeedback-trained professionals," he said. 

Roura serves as a consultant to FIU-employed psychologists. Later this month, he will be giving them a graduate training seminar on the use of medication. 

"Both the CPSC and the Health and Wellness Center have worked with many contracted providers over the years. These providers are licensed, ethical, professional individuals who work well with our students," she said. 

Roura is available every Thursday from 2-4 p.m. in the center's office located in GC 211.

Subheadline: College of Engineering gets facelift, works to connect with university
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Improvements to the College of Engineering enhance the atmosphere of the school and complete the ad hoc committee's semester-long project aimed at improving aesthetics and combating the disconnection students feel with the rest of the campus, Dean Vish Prasad said.

Some of the 1,069 students who are in the college don't feel they are a part of the University. Prasad said there are many campus activities that engineering students aren't a part of. 

"The problem is geographical. There's nothing you can do about it," said Jorge Soler, a first year graduate student in construction management.

In the last few months, students say study areas, transportation and communication with other parts of the university have improved. 

Dr. Patricia Telles-Irvin, vice president of Student Affairs and Human Resources, had bulletin boards showcasing upcoming university events installed. "Bulletin boards give students a sense of pride," Cindy Prather, assistant director of Academic Services for College of Engineering, said. 

Not all students agree. "Bulletin boards are put up with the best of intentions, but [the school] still feels isolated," Jose Mesa, a first year graduate student in construction management, said.

Pamphlets highlighting university activities are now available, lessening the apparent disconnection between the college and the campus, Prather said.

The building has undergone a facelift. It has a new name and has been painted red and yellow. Formerly the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences, the building located on Flagler Street and S.W. 107th Avenue is now called the Engineering Center. 

"I don't like [the paint], but at least they're trying to decorate it and make it look better," Marjorie Franco, sophomore, computer engineering, said.

Prasad's office has purchased more than 20 tables and 80 chairs for the school's dining services area, the Panther Pit, and the third floor. The tables are intended for additional study space, Prasad said. 

Student lounges are now available in every department, complete with sofas and tables.

"Together, all of these things add to [students'] total college experience," said Prather.

Potted plants and art by professor of electrical and computer engineering Dr. Grover Larkins are some of the aesthetic additions, Prasad said.

A new traffic light will be added at the intersection of S.W. 107th Avenue and Flagler Street because the current light does not change fast enough for the amount of traffic, Prasad said. Turning lanes will be elongated for convenience and students' safety, Prather said.  

Space on the second floor of the building houses the new College of Engineering library. It is open daily.  The library doesn't have many books, but students draw most of their information from Internet databases, Vivian Wang, coordinator of the library said.

She is arranging to place a drop box outside the library to make the task of returning materials easier for students. "Students seem to like [the library] a lot, as does the faculty," Wang said. "Still, we have a ways to go."

The Engineering Information Center, a computer lab exclusively for student use, was recently  tiled. There are now 114 computers, a black and white photocopy machine acquired this June, an E-size plotter used to enlarge drawings and other images and two scanners. The center has also extended its operating hours from 8:30 a.m. until 9 p.m.  and is open weekends.

In a sign of school spirit, the ad hoc committee painted panther paws around the Engineering Center's campus.

The Engineering Student Council, an umbrella organization of 20 student branches of professional engineering societies now housed in the College of Engineering, purchased a pool table to help students unwind. 

Luis Martinez, Student Government Council representative for the College of Engineering, envisions the carpeted area in the Panther Pit as a place where students can relax by either laying back on soon-to-be-provided sofas or casually playing a game of table tennis or pool.

"We've got a pool table and a Ping-Pong ball table should be here by next semester," Martinez said. The ESC is in the process of purchasing balls and cues, he said.

 The College's administration still wants to place a secretary on the first floor of the school to greet visitors as they enter the building but hasn't made any specific plans to hire one.

&nbsp;
While you're sleeping, they're busy decorating. At midnight, they are stringing ribbon along the stairs, filling up balloons, tacking banners to the ceiling. Ever wonder who decorates the Graham Center in blue and gold, runs the free box office hits on Friday nights and opens the stage for students to karaoke their favorite songs? 

The Student Programming Council is behind the scenes of most campus events. 

"SPC provides free entertainment for stressed students and gives a chance for those participating to develop great leadership skills," SPC Advisor Cedric McMinn said.

Last week, in honor of American pop culture, SPC hosted American Heritage Week. "American Heritage Week exposes the foreign student body to American culture, just like the other heritage weeks will expose the American students to international culture," SPC President Ron Hollis said.

The week opened with a trivia game and an unusual boxing match with costumed opponents. By mid-week, the karaoke machine was turned on and students were belting out their favorite tunes. 

A '60s-style coffee house and open mic roused campus poets and musicians, and "Grease" was featured as a drive-in movie. At the end of the week SPC provided a free carnival and lunch for students. The carnival featured student Sumo wrestlers, gladiators, and a concert.

SPC provides a variety of activities that stretch from entertainment to a forum of expression. They have also scheduled a Ludacris concert in the Golden Panther Arena next Spring.

"SPC does a great job of organizing events on campus," freshman Mario Stecco said. "It's nice to walk through the GC forum and see all of the activities available for students." 

SPC started under the control of the Student Government Association until it branched off into the autonomous organization it is today. Approximately $275,000 worth of student fees go to the organization yearly. 

This means virtually everything SPC offers to students is free. Right now there are approximately 80 members of SPC at University Park and 40 at BBC. Members are separated into two groups: general members and associated members. The general members attend all-purpose meetings and can help out in any committee they choose, whereas associated members represent certain committees but may not have as much responsibility. There are 10 committees, each run by a chairperson that any student, regardless of age, can join. 

A film committee selects the movie shown on weekends. The Comedy Connection Committee books often well-known comedians  like Carlos Mencias and D.L Hughley. Coffee House committee offers an open forum where students can recite poems, speak what is on their mind, or simply listen to artistic expression while sipping free coffee. 

When students walk through GC hearing their favorite song or laughing at the small skits performed during lunch, that's the Break-Away committee at work. They specialize in offering students a stress free dining experience. 

The Net Premiere Movie committee debuts movies prescreened at campuses all around the United States.  The Special Events committee organizes football games and all kinds of parties. The Cultural Celebration Committee plans four events aimed at celebrating American, Hispanic, Pan-African, and Hawaiian cultures. The publicity and marketing committees are responsible for promoting and finding sponsors for SPC. 

"SPC has been a blast because we [SPC members] became friends," SPC Film Chairman Jorge de Moya said. "We always have something to do inside or outside school that is a lot of fun." 

Students interested in being a part of SPC or simply finding out more about upcoming events, should go to GC 341  or WUC 363  BBC.

When freshman Sultana Arabah goes out, sometimes people stare. Dressed in her religious garb and donning her hijab, a religious veil, Arabah is often met with sideways glances and fearful looks, a common occurrence, she says, since Sept.11. 

"People ignore me, but it's good," Arabah said. "I like it. I would rather have people ignore me than hurt me."

Arabah was one of the students who attended a forum last Wednesday to dispel the myths about Muslims and Islam. The Muslim Student Association hosted the event to help students uncover and understand Islam in light of Sept. 11. 

Keynote speaker Dr. Daniel Alvarez, professor of religious studies, emphasized that there is no such thing as a Muslim terrorist.

"What people have to understand is that Islam is a religion not a nationality." freshman Sabrina Hattar said. Hattar is a Palestinean who, like many, attended the event because she was curious. 

Terrorism has been defined as what Arabs have done to the United States, but one cannot judge the religion of Islam by a single act, Alvarez said.

The event began with prayer, was followed with Palestinean cuisine and featured keynote speakers Alvarez and Imam Rafiq Mahdi. 

"The night was successful because the people came, both believers and non-believers," Arabah said. "I definitely learned from listening to the speakers and have a newfound respect for Muslims." 

"I hope for non-Muslims to gain a better perspective about Islam, our beliefs and culture." Linda Raheem said. Raheem is the faculty advisor for MSA and has been a Muslim for 25 years.  

"I felt that the night was a success because of the huge turn-out," Karen Garner, director of women's center, said.

A second forum will be held in the Spring and will focus on women in Islam.

Headline: BBC housing bus out of service
Subheadline: Students who live on campus are frustrated as accidents, licensing and insurance issues delay shuttle
Author: Cari Cohen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Carla Osorio, a native of Puerto Rico, chose to attend FIU, she was looking forward to experiencing Miami. But for the past two months, Osorio has been stuck at the dorm.  She chose FIU, in part, because of its location, she said. Though she doesn't have a car, a university shuttle allowed her to go shopping, to the grocery store, or to the movies at her leisure. 

 Osorio, like many BBC students, took advantage of the Panther Prowler, a free shuttle service that transports students from the residence halls to various places, including the mall and Publix. For the past two months, however, the shuttle has been out of service. 

"The last time we saw the shuttle [was] Sept. 17," Brenda Liz, a graduate student, said. "We feel like we're in a prison."

The Prowler was involved in two accidents, and officials said this is one reason it is currently out of service. A dat e for the restoraton of service has not been confirmed.

"There were two very minor accidents," said Esther Propis, coordinator for the Division of Student Affairs and close friend of the shuttle driver. 

The first accident was a fender-bender that took place during training of the shuttle driver. The second "was a minor accident with a Miami-Dade transit bus," Bill Williamson, director of Student Affairs, said. "There was some damage done to the shuttle." 

"We are in the process of having the necessary repairs done," said Brian Haynes, assistant vice president of Student Affairs.

Little information was disclosed to The Beacon about the driver. Propis said he is known as "Yuca" but would not give his complete name. 

Prior to the accident, students told sophomore Bether Gomez, a desk assistant in housing, that the driver was not paying attention to the road, consistently speeding and turning around to engage in conversation with students while driving. 

"No residents would ever go on the shuttle," she said.

In addition to the accidents, a licensing issue has also delayed the shuttle's return, Propis said. In the 13 years she has worked at FIU, none of the shuttle drivers have been required to have a commercial license. "The law says that if you have 13 passengers or less, [it] does not require a bus driver's license," she said. 

BBC Student Government Council President Adrian Carter said the license is a recent requirement from the new insurance company the university is working with.

After the accident, the Department of Environmental Health and Safety and Risk Management and the Department of Student Affairs began looking into the licensing and other safety issues. They may consider updating the licensing policy.

"I'm unhappy that they haven't been communicating to housing students the entirety of what's going on," Carter, said. "They deserve an explanation." 

Gomez thinks it has taken so long for students to find out the truth because of a lack of communication between the students and staff.

"We did not think the review would take as long, but now that we have taken a step back," Haynes said, "we want to do a thorough job. [We] will not compromise students' safety."

Carter arranged for Haynes to attend a Bay Vista  Council meeting on Nov. 6 where he would inform students about the status of the Prowler; Haynes did not show up.

"As a full-time student of FIU, I realize the burden of time we all face," Jessica DeCaprio, junior, said. "The Panther Prowler being out of service is not only a nuisance, but it is truly an obstacle."

Because the shuttle is not running, students who do not have their own source of transportation have been forced to ride with a friend, take the bus, or call a cab, three options students said are inconvenient.

"I don't like to bother people or for people to think that I'm only talking to them to go out," Osorio said.

The city buses cost $1.50 each way and do not run on campus on the weekend. If a student needs to get to Publix on the weekend, the closest bus stop means a 40-minute walk to the campus entrance on Biscayne Boulevard, Liz said. 

Students feel safety becomes an issue after dark. "It's kind of scary," Osorio, who usually makes the bus trips with a group of girlfriends, said.

Haynes said the shuttle should be running again by Spring semester. "[We are] evaluating the service from head to toe," Haynes said. "Our goal is to provide a service that is even better than our current service."

Subheadline: Visitors discuss Cuba's aid to Africa
Author: Rene Diaz Iturrey / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Amidst protest and under tight security, Victor Dreke Cruz, vice president of the Cuba-Africa Friendship Association, an alleged human rights violator, and Dr. Ana Morales Varela, professor at the Latin American School of Medicine in Havana, visited FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus Wednesday night. University support wanes as many question the approval of both his visa and his visit. 

Morales and Dreke, a retired commander of Cuba's Marxist Revolution, visited to host an academic discussion on the role of Cuba in Africa. They discussed Marxist Cuba's contribution to the betterment of the poor of Africa and the Americas. 

"Cuba has sent doctors to 91 countries in Africa and Latin America," Morales said. "They go to places where the people have never seen a doctor."

Dreke discussed Cuba's struggle in 1902. "[Cuba's] freedom passed from the hands of Spanish colonialism to the hands of American imperialism." He said it was not until the Cuban triumph "on Jan. 1, 1951, [that Cuba was] free, independent, and sovereign."

However, attendees said the event turned into a shouting match as the opposition to Dreke's presence heightened. 

Cuban-Americans in the audience cried "Murderer, Murderer," clutching white sheets of paper listing the names of those who died under firing squads at Dreke's command. 

"It's a shame that Dreke, who represents so much shed blood and is responsible for genocide in Cuba, is allowed to come here," Reynaldo Aquit, 62, a political prisoner for 12 years, said. 

FIU Police escorted several people out of the room, but no arrests were reported.

Dreke's visit has roused speculation from community officials as well as those at the university. 

A letter to secretary of state Colin Powell by South Florida Congressmen Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Iliana Ros-Lehtinen question the issue of an academic visa to Dreke, who they dismissed as "an instrument of torture in the Cuban military."

According to their letter, "given Mr. Dreke's human rights record and his proximity to dictator Fidel Castro, a sworn enemy of the United States, we inquire as to the reasoning behind his visa approval." 

There is some doubt regarding Dreke's academic credentials, Dr. Raul Moncarz, vice provost and professor at BBC said.

Many students and university officials were not made aware of the visit until about two weeks ago. Moncarz, found out about the visit on Nov. 6.

Olukemi Adeyemo, senior, nutrition and dietetics, wondered what all the commotion was about. "I have been hanging around for a couple of hours with nothing to do," Adeyemo said. "I whish they would have done more to promote it. I would have gone."

Dr. Boyce Davies, who is listed as one of the co-sponsors of the program, said "there was an interest and process in place for getting them here, that actually either preceded my return [to FIU] or took place independent of me. I was made aware of the formal execution of the visas about a week and a half ago."

However, letters provided to The Beacon show Dr. Jean Rahier, African-New World studies associate professor, sent letters of invitation that made it possible for Dreke and Morales to obtain the necessary U.S. State Department visas on May 22, 2002

Although Moncarz said he "believes in academic freedom," he also said "academic procedures would have been followed" before inviting Dreke and Morales.

"I would have contacted my department chair first had I wanted to invite someone to speak [at FIU],"  Moncarz said. "I would have opened it up for discussion. I'm hurt and disappointed this person is coming to the university."

Dr. Modesto Maidique issued a statement that his position as president of FIU "obliges [him] to protect and defend the rights of faculty who have invited these emissaries from Cuba to speak."

Alicia Del Busto, 66, a political prisoner for 12 years, believes that the university should not have allowed Dreke to speak. "[Maidique] should have resigned before allowing this to happen."

Raul Garcia, a political prisoner for 16 years, said he witnessed Dreke's abuse of other prisoners and agreed. "If [Maidique] needed community support, he wouldn't get it," he said. "I went to a Little League game with my grandchildren. Everyone was talking about it." 

Maidique called on "the community to understand and respect the liberties that this country offers."

Not everyone was upset about the visit. At the conference, those who supported the visit outnumbered Cuban-American protesters. These included members of Miami Against the Embargo of Cuba, Alianza Martiana, the Socialist Workers Party and The Young Socialist members who stood and applauded vigorously when Dreke and Morales spoke.

Dr. Peter Craumer, international relations professor and one of the petitioners for the visas, was happy that Morales and Dreke visited FIU. The university, as a market place of ideas, functions best when all ideas are discussed, Craumer said.

Joshua Daniels, 25, a graduate student at California State University in Los Angeles, came from California with a group of young socialists and said he was glad to be here. "I want to learn all I can," he said.

"I want for America the same system [of government] that Cuba has," said Lawrence Mikes, 22, a member of The Young Socialists.

Moncarz, who observed the night's activity from a corner in the back of the room, was disappointed. "I wish more students and faculty would have participated," he said.

Upon seeing one of his students, history professor Dr. Peter Stedman "I'm glad to see you here. I think you are the only FIU student here."

physically.I did a research on this(poison)that is what the younger people call it here.2 of the people here are suffering mental draw backs.

Headline: FCF: Consistent defenders of free speech
Subheadline:  
Author: fcf@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
The Free Cuba Foundation is a student organization active at FIU since 1993. We have consistently defended human rights and democratic principles especially when individuals or organizations we disagree with have had their rights violated. We applaud President Maidique on this occasion for defending two important fundamental rights: freedom of speech and assembly. This is what Cuba's outlawed democratic opposition is fighting for.

Afro-Cuban opposition leader, Jorge Luís García Perez "Antúnez," remains imprisoned after 12 years for exercising his right to free speech stating publicly that "communism is a utopian error " and advocating for "reforms like those taking place in Eastern Europe". In a dictatorship like Cuba where free speech is illegal it is identified in the Cuban criminal code as "oral enemy propaganda". Antúnez stands convicted of expressing his own opinions and remains in prison at the Combinado de Guantánamo Prison because the regime has not been able to break him. 

Yet even prison walls cannot silence great men, and he has continued his work as a human rights activist. Prison authorities have responded with severe beatings and the denial of medical care. Human Rights Watch in its 2001 report on Cuba revealed the denial of medical treatment as a method of punishment stating, "Political prisoners who denounced poor conditions of imprisonment were punished with solitary confinement, restricted visits, or denial of medical treatment." Amnesty International issued medical actions, which mentioned how in September 1997 more than 30 prison guards at the Combinado de Guantánamo Prison physically brutalized Antúnez and two other prisoners while they were handcuffed. Antúnez was beaten on the face, neck, abdomen, ribs and back (see Cuba: Ill-treatment of Three Political Prisoners, AMR 25/44/97, 8 December 1997). Prison authorities concede Antúnez has a "nonmalignant pulmonary cyst" according to his family Antúnez has difficulty breathing. Amnesty International issued a medical action for Antúnez in which they expressed their concern at reports that Antúnez's health was seriously deteriorating.

In Cuba today free speech is a crime identified in the Cuban criminal code as "oral enemy propaganda". Since 1990, Jorge Luís García Perez "Antúnez" has been a living symbol of the absence of free speech in Cuba.  Mr. Dreke Cruz's visit to FIU is proof that free speech is alive and well in the United States during wartime. Please help us bring back free speech to Cuba and save Antúnez's life by signing this online petition.

Subheadline:  
Author: alvarezd@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
To the editor:

I would like to clarify that the statement "there is no such thing as Muslim terrorist" was made, as I recall, by Imam Rafiq Mahdi, not by me.  Unfortunately, as I did say, there are enough texts in any of our religious traditions, and i alluded to words attributed to Jesus in the Gospels, the Book of Revelation, and the Book of Deuteronomy as examples, that if taken literally may lead someone to believe an act of violence against other human beings is either commanded or condoned by God.  I also alluded to the Crusades as examples of aggression perpetrated in the name of God.  

I went on to challenge the literalist reading of the Qur'an by Fundamentalists (as I challenge the reading of the Bible by my fellow Christian Fundamentalists) and recommended that Islam be interpreted in the light of Allah's two most prominent attributes, Mercy and Compassion.  Lastly, I identified as one of the challenges for Muslims in our times to understand (as it is a challenge to Hindus, Christians, and Jews) understand the Qur'an in the light of its spirit and not the letter, for the letter can kill.  I had in mind my own earlier remark that although not every Fundamentalist (whether Christian, Jewish, or Muslim) is a terrorist, one will usually find that a terrorist is a Fundamentalist of one kind or another.

Implicit in my remarks to my Jewish, Christian, and Muslim brothers and sisters is that the Qur'an or the Bible is not an uninterpreted book, and that is the living community that will determine which interpretation of their own sacred texts is or should be the most authentic and consonant with the spirit of their religion and their contemporary experience.  I addressed myself to the Muslim community in America with optimism, because I believe it will be the Muslims of America and the West that, living side by side with Christians, Jews, Hindus, and the like, will creatively appropriate their Islamic heritage and provide a necessary and invaluable corrective to interpretations of the Qur'an that may seem to some, such as bin Ladin and other terrorists, as justifying violence, hatred, and destruction of human life.

It is my conviction that there is enough greatness of spirit and compassion towards our fellow human beings in the Islamic tradition, just there is in Judaism, Hinduism, and Christianity, to allow us to say that there should not be any Muslim, or Christian, or Jewish, or Hindu terrorist.  The sad fact is that there are such terrorists, whether or not we may wish to distance our religious traditions from their actions, or whether in an ideal understanding of our religious traditions such acts of terror are incompatible with the essence and spirit of our religions.

Headline: opinion : the war with iraq
Subheadline:  
Author: sanya1234@aol.com
&nbsp;
To the editor,

Turn on the radio, look online or open a newspaper and it seems as if all we are hearing about is this war on terrorism. We have a war going on in Afghanistan, we're planning to take action against Iraq and now it seems as if we may be adding North Korea to our lists of countries that pose a threat to the world. As American tax dollars continue to go toward our military (and building weapons of mass destruction that we'll be using to punish other countries for having weapons of mass destruction), I can't help but think about the thousands of lives that will be ended as a result of this and the millions of dollars per month that we are spending to fund this war.
	Everyday students around the country are unable to receive a proper education because of lack of funding in their schools. What's even more shameful is that America, the richest country in the world, is full of inner cities where people live under conditions similar to those living in a third world country. In the nation's capital alone 39% of children are living below the poverty line. 
As inner cities continue to deteriorate, more children are being sent off to overcrowded schools, and we constantly hear messages from our government officials telling us that there is just not enough funding for education or for the war on poverty. However we seem to have unlimited funds when it comes to the military - where are the priorities of the US government? 
Wouldn't it be more beneficial to use this money to build a strong academic foundation for our children instead of building weapons? Shouldn't we try to take care of the problems of poverty and inequality in this country instead of trying to fix problems overseas? If the US government is so eager to spend money to make the world a better place, I strongly suggest they start at home and perhaps invest a little of that "gun money" in education and welfare reform.
