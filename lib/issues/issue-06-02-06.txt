Headline: Spring Break Destnations : Mexico
Subheadline: Original spring break hotspot more than the land of tequila and sombreros

~ Look for this spring break series in the Life! section every Monday issue through March 6 ~

Warm weather, sandy beaches and an 18-and-over drinking age make Mexico a popular spring break location for many college students. According to statistics from the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, over 100,000 students spend their spring breaks partying throughout the country. With expansive cities like Cancun and Mazatlan overflowing with entertainment, this statistic should not be surprising. 

Arguably the most renowned city in Mexico, Cancun has been the ideal site for many celebrity events such as MTV Spring Break. The spacious beaches play host to crazy beach parties and contests - allowing for a game of volleyball or two. For students who prefer to just relax and catch some sun, Cancun's clear blue skies provide the perfect opportunity for relaxation.

"I went to Cancun last year for spring break and got the perfect tan. Just laying out on the beach during some beautiful weather was so relaxing and totally got my mind off of schoolwork," said sophomore Gina Reyes. 

There are plenty of other activities offered in Cancun besides parties and contests. Parasailing, snorkeling and jungle trips are other distractions which can make your vacation more adventurous. Besides the active nightlife and favorable weather, Mexico also houses Mayan ruins and activities such as cliff diving that will make your trip worthwhile. To cap off your experience in Cancun, check out the different nightclubs such as The City and Bulldog Café, which play music and serve drinks until sunrise.

Although Cancun seems to get all the media attention in regards to spring break locales, Mazatlan is another place to visit during your stay. Both beautiful and cheap, Mazatlan offers tons of fun at affordable prices. Nightclubs and restaurants are within walking distance from most hotels and the warm climate makes walking bearable. Still, be sure to ride the open-bodied taxis which hold a maximum of four people - better known as pulmonias. Mazatlan isn't as popular as Cancun, but it is just as fun. It really is the best place to just go and soak up sun and eat good food for reasonable prices," said sophomore Jackie Gadea.

While nightclubs are a main attraction in Cancun and Mazatlan, they aren't as widespread in Acapulco, a town found on the pacific coast of Mexico. High-class hotels, such as the Hotel Copacabana, and upscale casinos give Acapulco a more mature vibe than Cancun or Mazatlan. This sophisticated atmosphere comes at a price though: Activities and food tend to cost more than the affordable prices found in other cities. Nonetheless, students who have the money to spend in Acapulco will have a unique experience.

"I've been to several cities around Mexico and I think Acapulco provides the best overall experience. The gorgeous hotels and classy restaurants give the city an advantage over the regular hotspots in Mexico," said junior Ameer Juman. "It is more expensive than other cities, but it's worth it." 

Rosarito Beach is another Mexican hotspot that is known for wild parties and lobsters, served Baja-style with rice, beans and tortillas. Students can pass the time by riding ATVs, surfing and shopping until the parties start at night. Because of the many distractions available to tourists, it can be very difficult to keep track of your spending.

"I went to Rosarito Beach once and spent my money in two days. It's hard to manage your money with so many distractions around," said junior Ivan Rodriguez.

College students will not endure any dull moments if they head to Mexico for spring break. With so many attractions throughout the country, finding something to do should not be a problem.

Headline: Grammy Predictions
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Grammy Awards, music's biggest night, are the Nobel Prizes of the music industry. However, prestigious as they are, they are particularly known for ignoring great cutting-edge artists and critically acclaimed works in favor of average works from sentimental favorites or recently deceased veterans, leading many to rightfully dub them "the Grannies." This year's Grammy Awards will be announced Feb. 8 at 8 p.m. on CBS. The following are the nominees followed by my predictions in the top categories:

Album of the Year:

The Emancipation of Mimi - Mariah Carey

Chaos and Creation in the Backyard - Paul McCartney

Love. Angel. Music. Baby. - Gwen Stefani

How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb  - U2

Late Registration - Kanye West

Carey's album, the top-selling disc of 2005, is just that: a commercial success. Her winning over West, Bono and company, as well as a Beatle would be a travesty. This award should go to West. Not only is Late Registration inventive, entertaining and engaging, it also is one of the year's best works. However, his main rival might be himself. West's arrogant attitude and antics have turned off many, which may lead to many of Grammy's conservative members to vote for U2, arguably the most respected band since The Beatles, who won for this category in 1987 for The Joshua Tree.

Will and Should Win: Late Registration - Kanye West 

Record of the Year

"We Belong Together" - Mariah Carey

"Feel Good Inc." - Gorillaz feat. De La Soul

"Boulevard of Broken Dreams" - Green Day

"Hollaback Girl" - Gwen Stefani

"Gold Digger" - Kanye West

What's B-A-N-A-N-A-S doing here? Voters will either go with Green Day's poignant "Boulevard of Broken Dreams," or, more safely, with Carey's overplayed monster ballad. It was, after all, the biggest record of 2005. It would be a fitting cherry on the cake for Carey, who's had one of the biggest comebacks in music history. 

Will Win: "We Belong Together" - Mariah Carey

Should Win: "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" - Green Day


Song of the Year

"Bless the Broken Road" - Rascal Flatts

"Devils & Dust" - Bruce Springsteen

"Ordinary People" - John Legend

"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own" - U2

"We Belong Together" - Mariah Carey

An award for the year's best written song, I'm hoping for anything but Rascal Flatts' schmaltz fest. Voters could make it the "Mariah" show by voting for her but they'll go with Legend's beautiful ballad. If it were up to me, I'd vote for Bono's touching tribute to his father or The Boss' haunting, "Devils & Dust".



Will Win: "Ordinary People" - John Legend

Should Win: "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own" -U2

Best New Artist:

Ciara

Fall Out Boy

Keane

John Legend

Sugarland

No offence to the other nominees, but this is Legend's award to take. The Grammys love piano playing solo artists (see Alicia Keys, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel, ect.) He should take this in a cakewalk. 

Will and Should Win: John Legend


Best Female Pop Vocal Performance:

"It's Like That"- Mariah Carey

"Since U Been Gone" - Kelly Clarkson

"Good Is Good" - Sheryl Crow

"I Will Not Be Broken" - Bonnie Raitt

"Hollaback Girl" - Gwen Stefani

This one's between the cheerleader song and the American Idol. Stefani, a Grammy favorite, will win since her song is also nominated in the general field; too bad, because Clarkson's song is far superior. 

Will Win: "Hollaback Girl" - Gwen Stefani

Should Win: "Since U Been Gone"- Kelly Clarkson


Best Rock Album:

X&Y - Coldplay

In Your Honor - Foo Fighters

A Bigger Bang - The Rolling Stones

How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb - U2 

Prairie Wind - Neil Young

Wow! What a group of fantastic albums. U2 has been nominated and won this category five times. They're not going home empty-handed.

Will and Should Win: How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb - U2


Best Contemporary R&B Album:

Touch - Amerie

The Emancipation of Mimi - Mariah Carey

Destiny Fulfilled - Destiny's Child

Turning Point - Mario

O - Omarion

Voters might want to reward Destiny's Child one last time, but Mimi will reign supreme. By the way, what in the world is Omarion doing here? Talk about category filler.

Will Win: The Emancipation of Mimi - Mariah Carey

Should Win: Destiny Fulfilled- Destiny's Child

Best Rap Song:

"Candy Shop" - 50 Cent featuring Olivia

"Diamonds From Sierra Leone" - Kanye West 

"Don't Phunk With My Heart" - The Black Eyed Peas

"Hate It Or Love It" - The Game featuring 50 Cent

"Lose Control" - Missy Elliott featuring Ciara & Fat Man Scoop

How sweet! The Grammys still consider The Black Eyed Peas as rap.  I'd vote for The Game and 50 Cent just to see them accept the award on stage without resorting to violence. This award is Mr. West's though.

Will and Should Win: "Diamonds From Sierra Leone" - Kanye West

Best Country Album:

Fireflies- Faith Hill

Lonely Runs Both Ways - Alison Krauss And Union Station

Time Well Wasted - Brad Paisley 

All Jacked Up- Gretchen Wilson

Jasper County - Trisha Yearwood

Country albums have the strangest titles. Alison Krauss has a billion Grammys to her credit and will probably score another one here. Hill could crash her party as her album is the top selling of the group.

Will Win: Lonely Runs Both Ways - Alison Krauss and Union Station

Should Win: All Jacked Up - Gretchen Wilson


Best Short Form Music Video:

"Lose Control" - Missy Elliott

"Feel Good Inc." - Gorillaz featuring De La Soul 

"Feels Just Like It Should" - Jamiroquai 

"God's Will" - Martina McBride  

"World On Fire" - Sarah McLachlan

McLachlan's subtle video with a message is the best of the bunch, but since when does best equal award glory? The Gorillaz should be able to win this one for their breakthrough animated video. Being a Record of the Year nominee helps their case.

Will Win: "Feel Good Inc." - Gorillaz featuring De La Soul

Should Win: "World On Fire" - Sarah McLachlan

Headline: Women don't choose handbags lightly
Author: Bonnie Bing / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Finding the perfect handbag is as difficult as finding the perfect husband or the perfect car. The choices are there, but you don't know if you love it or if your needs are met until you've had it around for a while.

The choice is difficult because not only is a handbag a useful, constant companion, it also makes a fashion statement.

While some women worry more about function than appearance, others prefer to be trendy and will sacrifice function for just the right look.

When asked what the must-have feature in a handbag is, women offered very definite answers:

It has to be a shoulder bag. My purse has to have a cell phone compartment. It has to stand up when I put it on the floor, and it has to have little metal thingies on the bottom so the bottom doesn't get gross.

It has to be an unusual color. No black purses in my closet. My purse has to have an outside pocket for my keys. I hate digging for keys. The answers go on and on.

Finding the right handbag isn't as easy as it may seem. A purse can't be so big that it could double for an overnight bag, or so small that it won't close when you jam everything in it.

Some women don't like having two handles on a shoulder bag because one strap is always falling off the shoulder. 

With so many opinions, it's not surprising that the handbag sections of department stores offer a mind-boggling selection.

Some women prefer to carry one purse all season and not change except for evening. Others like to change their purse with nearly every outfit. Regardless of your preference, there's a handbag or many for you. It's just finding it.

How to find the right one:

-Put a handbag you like on your shoulder while you're shopping. If it's heavy, imagine what it will be like when you put all your stuff in it. Too heavy.

-Look in a full-length mirror while wearing the handbag in question. Is it in proportion with your body? Does the handle allow it to hang properly and at a good length?

-If you're going for a fun, new color, make sure you have clothes the handbag will complement.

-Consider compartments. Lots of them inside and outside a handbag seem to be a good idea for organizing contents, but may mean spending a lot of time searching through compartments for keys, lipstick, etc.

-Get the right material for your lifestyle. Trendy knit, crochet and fabric bags abound, but they're not as durable as handbags made of leather and leather-like materials. It's not wise to spend your entire handbag budget on a fabric purse.

-Check the hardware on the bag. Is it attached securely? Will anything on the bag snag clothing? Will the bag close, even when it's full?

-Give it a trial run. After using a new handbag for a few days, you'll know if you love it. If you do, go back and buy another one in the same or a different color. You'll be glad you did.

Think of the searching it will save you.

"The very first bag was probably a fistful of skins tied to a bit of stick, a provisional container for food and flint," writes Anna Johnson in her book, "Handbags, the Power of the Purse." "From these simple beginnings, the bag has blossomed into every form, color and material imaginable."

Blossomed indeed. Walk into a handbag department this season and you're surrounded by metallic leather hobo bags accented with rows of grommets, rectangular purses with a wrist strap, crocheted bags covered with pailettes or sequins and sleek, colorful tote bags, to mention a few.

Purses range from a few dollars to a few thousand dollars and every price in between.

I love purses because even if you've gained weight, you can go shopping and still have fun. 

You don't have to go into a little dressing room, and you can try on a lot of purses in a very short time. And it's fun to watch the huge selection and check the trends.

A popular movie star carrying a particular bag will start a run on them, and before long the style is on back order. 

Those who can't afford the genuine article will search for a good knockoff.

Most women won't leave home without it, and somehow it offers a sense of security. A handbag full of personal property becomes an extension of the woman.

I was with a half dozen fashion writers who were having lunch in New York. 

A guy grabbed a purse from under the table and was gone in a flash. The owner of the purse was stunned, then she said, crying, "I feel violated and mad. I feel like he stole a part of me."

Whether you're carrying one of this season's 'it' bags or that favorite from last year, you know the importance of getting just the right purse and the attachment you feel after you've carried it for a while.

Headline: Iraqi Veterans
Subheadline: Students share different war experiences
Author: Jackie Diaz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After learning that the World Trade Center had been attacked, Hector Gonzalez knew his life had changed forever. 

A couple of weeks into the 2002 Spring semester at FIU, Gonzalez dropped all his classes and volunteered to take part in the war in Iraq.	

"Ever since the 9/11 attack happened, I wanted to get involved and do something. Especially in my line of work, saving people's lives and rendering first aid. For me, there was a need for me to be there,"  said Gonzalez, a junior majoring in criminal justice.

Gonzalez joined the military in 1997 when he was a junior in high school, through a point system in the reserve unit. 

After obtaining an associate's degree from City College, Hector transferred to FIU and joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. 

Several weeks later, he left the air conditioned halls of FIU for the combat fields of Baghdad, Iraq.

"It was a very vivid experience. [It's] a thing you wouldn't wish anybody else to see, but that's part of your line of work, part of your duty," Gonzalez said. 

Electricity, running water and freedom are things Gonzalez now appreciates more than ever.

"Believe it or not [this experience] makes people notice the little things in life, not take things for granted and I think that makes me a better person," Gonzalez said. 

Although Iraq is an Islamic country that has been under fascist rule for over a decade, Gonzalez believes it can be democratized. 

"It all depends on how badly Iraqi people want that change and from my first-hand experience, I've noticed that they want to be free. Of course, being in life and death situations changed me as a person, but I would do it all over again. This choice was a huge milestone in my life and if I'm needed, I'll do it all over again," he said. 

After serving 18 months in Iraq, Gonzalez returned home in February 2004. 

He could get deployed again, depending on how long the troops stay in Iraq. Gonzalez expects it could be another four to five years.  

Chris Thrift, a 28-year-old junior majoring in history, returned home with a different outlook on the war. 

"When we left to Iraq we thought we were doing the right thing. When we got there we were blown away; we didn't need to be there. I can't say that we did much good, unless it was on a personal level, which was giving away items to kids or food to the people," Thrift said. 

Thrift joined the army reserves after graduating from high school in 1995, when he was just 18- years-old. He wanted financial assistance with college and the chance to gain the experience necessary to help him land a job with the FBI. 

Thrift was deployed to Iraq in February 2003 while finishing his associate's degree in Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville. 

"For 11 months our main job was to drive trucks with fuel and military supplies to different destinations and raid houses. We were told to raid these homes because the people were suspected of harboring insurgents or having weapons sealed away," Thrift said.

On every raid his unit would find nothing, it turned out that the intelligence reports they had were three-months-old. 

"What people don't seem to understand is that these Iraqis could have been regular people, but now we've gone in and made enemies," Thrift said. 

Thrift's unit also had to train Iraqi police; the problem was  the unit was ordered to switch missions every two weeks. New troops had to take over and start training from the beginning, which led to inefficiency. 

"A couple of times we had to rescue Iraqi police from being attacked because they weren't trained properly, or if they were, they didn't have ammunition," Thrift said. 

Not only did Thrift disagree with the administration behind the operation, but also with the way soldiers were being used. 

"Soldiers were sent to Baghdad with only two weeks training. We were once with a New York unit with little training and five of them died within the first week," he said. 

Thrift views the war as something that should have never happened, but said it is now too late to leave. 

"Some Iraqis wanted to remove Saddam, but most people didn't have a problem. He wasn't invading people's homes and breaking everything in sight. We just caused more of a problem than there ever was. I think it's all about the money and nobody wants to dig deep to find out what is really going on," Thrift said.  

Thrift returned home June 2004. 

His contract expired while serving in Iraq, but it was extended almost nine months. 

Although he spent 17 months in combat, he is not receiving any military benefits due to his non-active status in the army reserves. 

Thrift had a surplus of 11 months worth of his GI Bill educational benefits, but was unable to use it because he got deployed. 

Now a student at FIU, he must work full time inorder to pay for his classes. 

Thrift left Iraq with life altering experiences which he doesn't regret but would think twice about going back. 

"The whole administration is not good. It was total chaos," Thrift said.

Headline: Alumni honored with Torch Awards
Author: Mikana Maeda / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Torch Awards Gala is one of the Alumni Association's largest and most anticipated events of the year. 

The prestigious awards will be presented to FIU alumni who have achieved high levels of success in their fields and in the community.  

The ceremony honors those who have had an impact on the school and community similar to that of the late Senator Earnest R. Graham who passed legislations which eventually led to the approval of the university.  

Not only was he the one who started the creation of FIU, but he is the reason why the Torch Awards was started. 

The idea began in 1972 when Graham was honored for his contributions. It was not until 2001 that the Torch Awards were first presented.   

"The awards have grown substantially because the profile of the FIU graduate has really grown substantially as well," said Randi West, associate director of Outreach and Special Events for the office of alumni relations. "The quality of graduates which FIU has been producing is reflected in the candidates which are now being put forth for these awards." 

The ceremony honors a very diverse group of alumni. 

This year there are 16 award recipients. Each of the 11 colleges at FIU will be giving a Torch Award to one of its alumni. 

The additional five awards represent different categories. 

The Outstanding Faculty Award is the only award that can honor a non-alumni. 

"Identifying the recipient of the Outstanding Faculty Award posed this year's greatest challenge to the Torch Awards committee because the quality of the FIU faculty is so superlative; the committee found it difficult to single out just one honoree," West said. 

Recipients are considered for the awards through nominations which the Alumni Association solicits from both FIU and the South Florida community. 

"Participation from the school, students and community is important for the integrity of the Torch Awards," West  said. 

Once the nominations are received by the Alumni Association committee, they go through a long process of selections - all occurring in less than one year.

The committee consists of 10 people, two who are past Torch Award recipients and one who is an FIU alumni. 

Most members are on the Board of Directors and are part of the FIU Alumni Association staff. 

West speaks for the committee and the FIU Alumni Association when she said they were pleased with the large amount of participation from the community in their nominations. 

The number of nominations in each of the categories has increased substantially and continues to grow. 

The Torch Awards Gala will be held Feb. 11 at 6:30 p.m., at Parrot Jungle.

Headline: Cafeteria director makes "positive impression"
Author: Sergio Carmona / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As famished Biscayne Bay Campus students line in the campus cafeteria to be served, Cafeteria Director Roger Clegg eagerly places roasted chicken on their plates. 

It's just another day at work for this passionate food caterer, whom also served for food chains Brinker International Food Chain and Aramark Innovative Dining Solutions. 

However, working at FIU is a special situation because he gets to serve students and faculty members of his alma mater.

"It makes me feel good because I'm here to serve faculty and students here at FIU," said Clegg, who earned his bachelor's in hospitality management in 1995. "I am comfortable at home and that's a plus." 

Clegg served as director of Amark's location at University Park for two years before transferring over to BBC in 2005. 

Upon taking over as director at BBC, Clegg has noticed the campus additions since he graduated, but nonetheless feels right at home. 

"There's been a lot of differences since I graduated, like the wine testing centers, that's new," Clegg said. "But I still see old professors and feel familiar with the campus."   

Throughout his career as a catering director, Clegg has achieved success due to his strong personality qualities.

"He's a very nice person who's very energetic and knowledgeable," said Pepe Garcia, operations manager of Aramark at UP. "He's a people's person who can rally people around him." 

These traits which shape his personality have enabled him to be a capable leader.

"He's a great leader who we can go over for help," said Elizabeth Barth, assistant service director at Aramark at UP. "He's very quick, easy going, feels very comfortable, and that's why [the] staff supported him."

Clegg didn't begin his college career as a hospitality major. 

Following his graduation from Coral Gables Senior High School, Clegg went to study business at Florida State University in Tallahassee. 

After two and half years studying at FSU, Clegg got a job at an upscale restaurant and immediately fell in love with food catering.  

He decided to make a career pursuit by not only switching majors, but schools as well.

"I learned a lot about food management and I knew that hospitality in FIU was one of the best in the country," Clegg said.  "So I got to go back home and I was very passionate about it."

After earning his bachelor's, Clegg worked for Brinker restaurant Macaroni Grill as well as Aramark. 

He won numerous sales awards over that time, but his top achievement is the positive feedback he receives.

"Positive feedback is recognition enough," said Clegg."Personally and professionally, any positive feedback for service is an achievement I enjoy."

Since taking over as director at BBC, Clegg has been overjoyed by the positive feedback concerning renovation.

"I've gotten a lot of comments on Java City and the overall look and quality," Clegg said. "It makes me feel good."

With talk for expansion of the cafeteria, Clegg is open to any suggestions that students have.

"Students can come by my office, call my number or leave feedback in the suggestion box," he said.

Clegg's keen interest in catering has impressed others.

"Students and faculty on [the UP] campus still ask for him", Barth said. "He's left a positive impression."

Clegg is currently married and has a daughter. His professional and personal successes have met his goals.

"I always liked working with people. I wanted them to be happy and I wanted to be a successful family man."

Headline: Professional opportunities offered at career fair
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Career Services kicked off Mega Career Week at University Park as well as the Biscayne Bay Campus on Jan. 29. 

Because each campus is hosting its own career fair, most programs may seem divided. 

However, focus is placed on programs which meet the needs of students according to their school and major. 

The BBC Career and Internship fair will be held on Feb. 8 in the Wolfe University Center ballroom on the second floor. 

The event will take place from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and gives students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with  over  30 different careers.

Students can speak to professionals from a myriad of different fields. 

The Career Fair will allow students to research more or have his or her resume considered for internship opportunities by various companies, even if they are not looking for a job right away.

Over 46 representatives from various companies including Norwegian Cruise Lines, MTV Networks in Latin America  Miami-Dade County schools, City of Miami and Delano Shore Club are scheduled to attend the fair.

"The career fair gives the opportunity for students to come and interact, as well as network, with these employers and get a vibe for what they might be looking for in a future employee, even if the student is not necessarily looking for a position," said Elliot Skylar, graduate assistant for Career Services. 

Skylar also works in employer relations and advises students to dress in professional attire because they are not only representing themselves, but also FIU.

"We're very welcoming to any student who wants to come into the fair, even if they realized just that day it was in progress. Our fair offers amazing opportunities to interact with the representatives. It is a social and professional atmosphere," Skylar said.

One of the main differences between BBC's and UP's fair is the focus on internship opportunities. This is distinct from UP's Career and Education fair. 

Two of the most prominent schools at BBC are the School of Journalism and Mass Communications and the School of Hospitality and Management and both schools require an internship that will prepare students before they graduate. 

The fair's focus on internships allows easier access for students majoring in communications and hospitality management to find something they can enjoy and might not find elsewhere. 

There will be various workshops offered throughout the week and month of February, consisting of resume writing classes and other career-oriented events to teach the best way to prepare for an interview and gain experience for the future.

Headline: University announces $2 million donation
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
When Modesto A. Maidique began his tenure as president of the University in October of 1986, Office Depot opened its doors to its first store in Florida.

Fast forward 20 years and both Maidique, through FIU and Office Depot, have been able to expand and grow in the community.

That's what Maidique spoke about Feb. 2 when Office Depot donated $1 million to the University's Building for Business Campaign.

The $1 million will be matched by the state - totaling $2 million - and will go toward the construction of the college's new $45 million, five-building complex at the University Park campus.

"Partnerships like Office Depot are critical to our success," Maidique said. "We have developed and Office Depot has developed."

Steve Odland, chairman and chief executive officer of Office Depot presented Maidique with the check.

"We have great respect for what FIU has created in the community," said Odland, whose company now operates 109 stores in Florida. "We are neighbors and now we want to be partners."

Besides the donation, the College of Business Administration will partner with Office Depot in other mutually beneficial initiatives such as internships at the company for students and projects which will assist in the placement of graduates in the company's international operations.

In recognition for their donation, Maidique stated that the University will name a multi-story lobby and accompanying first-floor student area in Common Hall the Office Depot Student Center. 

Commons Hall is the only three-story structure in the project.

"Internships and student programs will add value to our success," said Jose de la Torre, dean of the College of Business Administration. "[Their] support will help us to advance our efforts to a new level of excellence."

As part of the new partnership, Monica Luechtefeld, executive vice president for business development and information technology at Office Depot, has been invited to join the Dean's Council in the College of Business Administration.

The gift is part of Office Depot's $4.5 million Education and Diversity Partneship Program involving FIU, the University of Miami and Florida Atlantic University. 

It also includes the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities and the United Negro College Fund.

Subheadline: Methods used at rally accomplish little
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
When evangelicals are permitted to come on campus and preach their message, as was the case Jan. 30 at University Park, they came to the University knowing they were going to have an audience. It was not, however, the usual audience expected when someone speaks of a subject matter as fragile as religion. The audience was comprised of incensed individuals provoked by a hateful message. 

Campus Ministry USA - the group responsible for giving the rally - and their leader, George "Jed" Smock, knew exactly what they were getting themselves into when they came to speak. With rhetoric calling for the execution of homosexuals and oppression of other religions, these individuals enraged almost any bystander - as was intended.

The implications of the First Amendment have been one of the hardest fought battles of American politics. Even we as journalists - who owe our very existence to this clause - can often find ourselves caught in its grasp and awed by its seemingly endless complexities. Freedom of speech, once again, jumped to the forefront of the issue.    

Speech by its very nature is meant to be controversial. The First Amendment exists precisely to protect the most controversial of messages, whether it is from a Muslim fundamentalist group or the local Christian evangelist.  

The Beacon contacted the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) for further clarification on the issue, only to be affirmed that, in most cases, no matter how radical the message, the First Amendment will prevail.

 The minute you start to blur the lines of the first amendment, what is and what is not acceptable becomes ambiguous - standards that need not be anything but perfectly clear.

The situation had to be nearly to the point of riot before authorities could have asked the group to stop. And even if a riot had erupted, the police would have been obligated to protect Smock, as the only thing he would have been guilty of was saying things that people did not want to hear.

Some of the students who responded to this demonstration did so intelligently. Though the rally surely caught them off guard, makeshift signs were the only thing some students needed to denounce what was being said. Others, however, chose a more derogatory route; shouting expletives, ridiculing and even assaulting the demonstrators by ripping signage from their hands and stomping on them.    

Beside the fact that these students were at risk of being arrested for assault, they unfortunately stooped down to the level - perhaps even further than the evangelists themselves. These students only confirmed, in the minds of Smock and his crew, their inferiority. They accomplished nothing but furthering the very cause they were against. 

Both sides can learn something from this experience. Smock will not accomplish anything by coming to FIU and shouting at people. Ironic as it may seem, he was disregarding his own moral obligation to understand the audience to whom he was speaking, a diverse group of people in every sense of the word, and should have chosen a better means to deliver his message.

At the end of the day, both the students who attended the rally and the people actually giving the rally went home only more assured with what they already believed. For better or for worse, no minds were changed that Monday afternoon.

Headline: Abramoff paints lobbyists poorly
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Lobbying in Washington can be very profitable and expensive, especially if you happen to be Jack Abramoff. Because of his dealings with casino-rich Indian tribes for lobbying services, Abramoff had lots of pull in the capital until earlier this year when he plead guilty to mail fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy.

Abramoff used his influence and money to provide extravagant services and rewards to his team, including golfing trips to Scotland and skybox seats at sporting events. Abramoff's purchase of SunCruz casinos allowed for more funds to be distributed to his camp, along with all the business they had with Indian tribes. 

All these things turned Abramoff's lobbying into extortion and bribery.

Before, I probably viewed lobbyists as individuals attempting to take advantage of the government to manipulate it as they see fit, at least any lobbyist like Abramoff. But that's not true. Lobbying is like any legitimate business. Lobbyists represent, serve and build trust with their clients. They compete with each other for business. 

They can give to their clients as well as receive gifts as they see fit, as long as they are documented and within the legal limits. And, like any business, there are ethics to be followed. At the same time, there are lobbyists who wish to serve the public interest and aid noble causes as well as those who simply are in the business for the money and the influence.  

Going further, there are lobbyists who go beyond the legal standards to achieve their goals, like Abramoff.

With this kind of activity going on in Washington, it's no surprise why many find it hard to have faith in the system, especially when it is people of the system who are the ones trying to manipulate it. This is the type of behavior that gives anybody in politics a bad name, whether they are lobbyists or bureaucrats at the national or local level.  

It is a shame because there are individuals who go into politics with noble intentions who will be either shied away from all the corruption or be swallowed up by it. Abramoff started off doing legitimate business as a lobbyist in Washington. He gained influence and money that lead to serious leverage on Capitol Hill, but he overstepped ethical and legal boundaries which led to his downfall and, everyone else involved.

It is sad that it can be so easy to lose confidence in our system when it can be exploited through such means. Try as much as we want, it is unavoidable that there will be those who will try to manipulate the system. The good thing is that there are those who serve the public interest and work hard to prevent episodes like the Abramoff scandal from putting the nation under the dollar.  As long as there are those who care about how business is handled on Capital Hill, or anywhere for that matter, we can rest assured that justice will be served by those who attempt to break the law to buy power.

Headline: Homeless people need students' help
Author: Elayne Cardoso / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
What exactly is a homeless person? The homeless are more than 700,000 individuals who have no job or place to live and sleep on the streets. But the question you should be asking yourself is, how can I contribute to end homelessness in communities around Miami? 

The solution to ending homelessness is not an easy task. Had it been easy, the number of homeless would have been drastically reduced by now and that is not the case. 

The homeless are the unspoken heroes of America. A large percent went to Vietnam to defend the very same people that today do not help them. Yet most Americans hesitate to donate even a dollar to these individuals who risked their lives for them. 

There is a fear of the homeless and not a fear for the homeless in American societies. People have this predisposed idea that if money is given to a homeless individual, it will be used for alcohol and cigarettes. I once shared this belief until I realized that the homeless have taken  more advantage of your donated time and money at centers where better resources are offered. 

Once society acknowledges this fear, people can help by volunteering in Camillus House or by collecting donations for the Homeless Voice. Instead of dancing the night away in clubs close to Camillus House in the downtown area, students should feel compelled to spend an afternoon trying to help a homeless person.

Programs like Camillus House place the homeless in the care of  individuals who not only provide a place for them to sleep, but provide food and hospitable facilities. Government funded centers like this are able to help rehabilitate the homeless and, in time, help these individuals find a job and start a new life. 

Since 1987, when federal government programs geared to assist the homeless first appeared, more than 50 programs have been created and over 13 billion dollars have been spent to help provide better resources for these individuals. Unfortunately, this is not enough. Countless individuals starve every night while others enjoy warm cooked meals and luxurious lifestyles. It is hard to imagine living every minute of your life trying to survive. 

Ending homelessness requires students and others to dedicate time to fellow citizens in need. Imagine living under a bridge in the cold or hot Miami nights with no bed to sleep in and going days without eating. The sad truth is that regardless of the amount of money the government donates, it is not enough. I urge people to contact facilities such as Camillus House and try to help. By donating your time, you help a person achieve a new lifestyle. 

If you would like to help end homelessness, contact Camillus House at (305) 374-1065 or visit their website at www.camillushouse.org.

Subheadline: Protest to evangelical's message appropriate. Not "used up oxygen."
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
I am writing to you in response to the article "Campus rally incites anger." Your contributing writer, Adrian Cordero, should perhaps take a crash course in journalism 101.

It is not enough to say that this is an opinion piece, which reserves the right to take on a story from a subjective point of view, a journalist is still responsible for getting the facts - something Cordero seriously lacked when writing the article. I have never read such a pretentious piece of garbage. 

Cordero seems to be pretty settled in his feelings on protesting, saying that it is just "used up oxygen and dispersed carbon dioxide." He clearly is not a history major, and it is also evident that he must have slept through any history course in grade school or he would know that if it weren't for protesting, groups like African-Americans and women would still be considered second-class citizens.

It is not OK to just walk by when a group of right-wing Christians is saying things like "execute the homosexuals" or singling out a woman wearing a hijab and insisting that she "stop her war on God." 

And while, yes, Cordero is exercising his right to free press, he does so without a shred of dignity or compassion. 

Where does he think he would be if his predecessors never fought for equality as Hispanics? Perhaps Cordero could use some time outside of Miami and see what it feels like to be ostracized on a daily basis for something you have no control over.

Headline: Muslim community overreacts to Danish comic strip
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
When Islamic terrorist groups demand action or a call to arms against a specific country, their reasons are usually backed by clear political grievances, wrapped in twisted rhetoric that at least carries some semblance of logic.

They want foreign troops to get out of their country - simple message, we get it.

They want to rid themselves of Western, secular influences - sure, you've made your point.

But for the last couple of days I've been left in extreme bewilderment (if not shock and anger) to see Muslim fanatics around the world start up a deadly fuss in protest of nothing else - but comic strips.

They were just 12 cartoons - some comical and in bright colors, others somber and in black and white - all of them sharing one thing in common: They were artists' depictions of the prophet Muhammad as published last September by the Jyllands-Posten, Denmark's most widely circulated right-wing newspaper.

At first, Denmark's Muslim population made intelligent strides by peacefully protesting that the cartoons not only insulted the great prophet of their faith, but also violated their commandment against any artistic renditions of the religious leader.

However, things began to escalate after imams traveled to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, touring with the cartoons as they asked religious communities to boycott Danish goods. The boycotts lead to rallies, which lead to mass demonstrations, which lead to bomb threats and kidnappings, which eventually lead to a cry for full-out war by terrorist groups like Hezbollah against any country whose papers published the cartoons.

 Now, many of the cartoons' critics have denounced them as being crude, insulting and in bad taste, but they ignore the fact that the cartoons were originally published as an experiment in censorship by the paper, stating that news facts and the free flow of ideas are purposefully concealed from the public in order to not incur the wrath of Muslim terrorists. 

One of the cartoons even features a man at his table drawing an outline of Muhammad; the artist hides part of the portrait with his arms as he nervously glances behind him.

The paper may not have chosen the best way to tackle this issue, but the ideas expressed in the comics and their aftermath show that terrorists have indeed become too influential, our fear of them slowly fueling an unconscious censorship of ideas.

World leaders already did nothing after the Ayatollah Khomeini issued a bounty in 1989 on the head of author Salman Rushdie when his novel, "The Satanic Verses," was seen as an insult to Muhammad's life and legacy. Though both the book's German and Norwegian translators were violently assaulted, its Japanese translator even killed, western governments tried their best to handle the situation as 'politically' as possible.

Even the 2004 assassination of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh (whose movie, Submission, set out to portray the oppression of women under Islam) was followed by calls from his native country to actually place laws punishing people for insulting other religions.

That groups can harbor hate for other groups because they feel that they've been unjustly oppressed is understandable; but to think that they can now order jihad because the smallest criticism offends them is (as has already been mentioned) bewildering.

Papers from Germany, Norway, France and other countries have begun to resist this petty bullying by publishing the cartoons themselves, an act of solidarity that stands in high contrast to the reaction of leaders like former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik, who only wag their fingers and blame these papers for being inconsiderate of others' religious beliefs.

Yes, threats and violent actions may follow these printings, but by sticking to their principles, the newspapers have shown that the supposed war on terrorism isn't (as has been supposed) a battle that can be fought through arms on visible soil, but rather a struggle of ideas in which reason must inevitably beat out terror.

They were just 12 cartoons, and this is what they set out to prove.

Headline: Play Ball!
Subheadline: Team expects to contend in Sun Belt Conference
Author: Patrick Jordan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Coming off a 35-27 record last season (12-8 in the Sun Belt Conference), the women's softball team is expected to continue their consistent play throughout the 2006 season. The team will look to continue and possibly improve its solid play at home, as they posted a record of 22-14 last season.

Despite the consistency executed last season, their record of 3-5 against ranked teams will have to improve if they want to make some noise in the Sun Belt Conference. Of the five losses, four of them came against  No. 14 Louisiana-Lafayette, who they will play twice this season, April 14-15.

Not only will Louisiana-Lafayette pose a threat to the team, but Florida Atlantic will also prove to be a challenge. 

"They are our biggest local rival," said head coach Kim Gwydir, who is in her ninth season leading the team. 

Last year's No. 17, Georgia, will also be a challenge when both teams meet up Feb. 11.

The team kicks the season off playing in the Diamond Sports Fun & Sun Classic on FIU grounds against Iowa Feb. 10.

This season will be the ultimate test for the coaching staff and the players, as they've lost five players from last year's lineup - including pitchers Tiffany Ore and Amanda Nealer. These losses will affect the club greatly as inexperience could be an issue on the mound - with two out of the three pitchers for the upcoming season being freshman.

Not only are there two freshman pitchers this season but there are also four other freshman who will make their debut.

However, Gwydir doesn't believe these are major issues, especially with the strength behind the plate this season due to the more established hitters which the team has, in particular junior catcher Tabitha Embry and senior catcher Jennifer Powell.

"We're a much better hit

ting team than last year," Gwydir said. 

One factor that will be important in the success of this squad is team unity, something the coaching staff and a number of the players feel exist within this unit. 

"We have a special group of girls," Gwydir said. "We also have a tremendous group of leaders." 

A group that Gwydir hopes can obtain this year's conference title.   



Outfield



With five outfielders on the current roster, four are returning players and  the experience factor may play a part in who starts this season.

Four out of the five players in the outfield are sophomores and higher, which is important because of familiarity with the game.

Cassie Parker, who will be the only senior in the outfield this season, hopes to build off her momentum from last season in which she was second on the team in homeruns, tied for team lead with six sacrifice bunts and third in stolen bases with 16.

To add to the powerhouse in the outfield, juniors Deomni Murray and Brittany Witherow should continue to help lead the team with their field play. 

A durable player, Murray started all 62 games last season, led the team with 53 hits and was second on the team with 19 stolen bases - proving her speed and athleticism. Witherow was named SBC Player of the Week last season, while also improving her batting average by 14 points from the previous season.

Freshman Kim Rodriguez and sophomore Christina Dyer will also  be solid contributors to the team.

 "[Rodriguez] has been a pleasant surprise this fall," Gwydir said. "She will force herself into the lineup this spring."



Infield



The lineup in the infield proves to be interesting with freshmen playing the positions of first base and shortstop. 

First basemen Lauren Spiers's performance in fall scrimmages ensured her the starting position. Great things are expected from the three-time 5-A All- Northwest Region selection out of Mountain Ridge High School in Glendale, Ariz. 

Shortstop Desiree Fink will also be in the starting lineup and her coach hopes to continue seeing her game mature throughout the course of the season. Originally from Lakewood, Calif., Fink was named as a Dream Team shortstop while playing in high school for the Lakewood High School Lancers.

Sophomore Tracy Deleon, who started three out of the 34 games she played last season, will play a more intricate role on the field this year as she will become the starter at second base. Despite a small role last season, Deleon scored 11 runs and had eight stolen bases on 10 attempts.  

Able to play both first and third base, Brook Ruiz, who started in 59 of her 61 games played last season, was one of two players who earned SBC Player of the week recognition while also placing second on the team with 11 doubles and second in on-base percentage with .326.

Freshman Samantha Card plays third base and was a three-time team MVP with Our Lady of Lourdes Academy in Miami.

"We can be successful because we have a strong unity," Card said. "We have put in a lot of time and dedication on the field."

Another hope Gwydir has for her team is that junior Tabitha Embry, who led the team with a .281 batting average, while also leading the team in doubles and triples, continues to put up those type of numbers during this season, along with displaying leadership to the ball club. 

Named First-Team All-Sun Belt Conference last season, the former shortstop and third baseman will make the transition to catcher, a position her coach sees as being instrumental to the improvement of her team.

Another player expected to maintain her solid play is catcher Jennifer Powell, a senior who established herself as a prime time player in the Sun Belt Conference last season, leading the team in homeruns, RBIs and slugging percentage. Powell has increased her numbers in all of these categories during of the past three seasons and that is why she was Second-Team All-Sun Belt last season.



Pitching



This is perhaps the biggest story within the team for the upcoming season. As stated earlier, three pitchers from last season won't be returning to the lineup.

One of those pitchers is Nealer, who was not only FIU's all-time leader in strikeouts but also its all-time leader in wins and consecutive complete games.

One way in which the team is hoping to rebuild on the mound is through redshirt freshman Sarah Belanger, who appeared in 12 games last season, posting a record of 2-0 and an ERA of 1.66 before suffering a season ending knee injury. 

Her first and only start last season resulted in a win over Connecticut, in which she struck out 11 batters. The Golden Panthers will need consistent efforts like that from Belanger, who will become the number one starter this season.

Kerri Houck will also attempt to rebound this season, after missing two months last season due to illness. Her record of 4-3 and 1.88 ERA last season is sure to improve if she can remain healthy and injury free throughout the season. 

Penny Eastman impressed the coaching staff with her level of improvement during the Fall. If she continues to improve, she will be another weapon on the mound. The freshman from Loveland, Colo. garnered 4-A Northern Conference Player of the Year honors her senior year at Mountain View High School and was named All-State in 2004.

Newcomers won't only make their presence felt on the field; two new assistant coaches, Meghann Almon and Stu Sachs will join Gwydir in her quest to make the Golden Panthers a power house in the Sun Belt Conference.

The softball team will kick off it's season hosting No. 10 Georgia, No. 24 Iowa, North Carolina and Arkansas in the Diamond Sports Fun & Sun Classic, Feb. 10-12 at University Park.

Headline: Senior struggles early in career, emerges as team star
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Senior catcher Jennifer Powell can crack a joke with her teammates in the locker room and you wouldn't think anything of it. The truth is, there was a time when her teammates didn't know she had a sense of humor. Like her famous arm, her jokes needed the exposure they deserved. 

	Switching positions as a freshman and struggling at the plate was just part of her journey, but the bulk of it comes from a more personal standpoint.

Powell was born in West Palm Beach, where softball - with an influence from her family - played an important part of her childhood.

"My parents were big supporters," Powell said. "My dad was my coach all throughout and my mom came to watch every game she could."

Growing up, Powell was the ideal child. She was a studious person, a great athlete and a responsible, trustworthy girl. But for some reason, her parents never understood that.

"Getting my family to trust my decisions was one of the toughest things in my life," Powell said. "I guess they were just really skeptical about who my friends were."

During her junior and senior years in high school, Powell stepped up big in the classroom - she would eventually graduate in the top-10 percent of her class - and was dominating on the softball field. She hit .429 and .450 her last two seasons and was named co-MVP her junior year.

But her success at school was not enough to overcome troubles at home.

"I remember coming home when I was a junior or senior and just fighting with my parents," Powell said, "It wasn't even over anything. I guess it was just the thing to do."

When it came time to pick a college, there was nothing more that Powell wanted than to attend the University of Michigan; it was not only a great school academically and athletically, but was also the perfect excuse to get out of the house.

"I was very hesitant to come [to FIU] at first because my dream was always Michigan," Powell said. "There was a lot of influence from my parents. I ended up coming here because I knew I would get homesick and I was going to need [my parents] eventually."

When Powell finally signed the letter of intent to come play at FIU, she had no idea of what to expect.  Suddenly, the star out of  West Palm Beach was starting from scratch and struggling to make the jump to the collegiate level.

"She was just a big fish in a small pond in high school, so when she came here it was a bit different," said head coach Kim Gwydir.

Powell played in 49 games (starting 27) and hit a mere .179, while striking out 29 times in just 84 at-bats. However, her struggles went way beyond what was visible on the stat sheet. Her problems came from the inside.

"My head wasn't in the game a lot," Powell said. "I tried so hard to focus, but I couldn't do things right."

After spending her entire life catching, Powell was suddenly moved to first base to make room for junior Kristen Perry. Although it is a usual move for catchers, the switch to first base proved perilous in Powell's drive to be great.

"I was just under a lot of stress because I had never played anything [other than] catcher," Powell said.  "It was almost like a totally new game for me. I was nervous all the time."

Her nerves didn't only pertain to the playing field. Reserved and distant, Powell kept to herself. Gwydir called her "the shortest six-footer she had ever seen" because she always "lived in the shadows."  

"It really hurt me, especially because I was very sensitive back then," Powell said. "I was on the verge of breaking down and quitting."

Thanks to support from her teammates, Powell stuck it out and moved on.

"That year I looked up to a lot of upper classmen and they helped me get through it. It was just such a tough year." Powell said. "Catching came naturally to me, so when I first got here I thought I knew everything, which wasn't the case."

Her junior year was the year she had been waiting for all along. She broke out by leading the team with seven home runs, 25 RBIs and a .458 slugging percentage. Suddenly, the struggling Powell was right back to where she belonged.

"I give her so much credit because she struggled mightily her freshman year," Gwydir said. "A lesser person would have quit and would not have gotten as far as she has."

Despite her parental problems, she says things couldn't be any better today.

"[We're] really close now and I think they've really gotten to know the good person that I am," Powell said. "I feel like I could talk to them about anything now."

Her success on the field has also proved vital in lifting her confidence.

"I consider myself to be the comedian of the team now," Powell said.  "I'm very sarcastic and witty at times, but I don't believe I'm outspoken. I say things when they need to be said, other than that, I just let my play do the talking."

If her play could talk, it would speak volumes. Not only is Powell a great power hitter, she possesses one of the strongest arms in college softball.

"I've coached a lot of players and I've never seen an arm like that," Gwydir said. "We had a pretty good year last year and she was a catalyst for that, not only because of her offense, but her defense."

Coming off a successful 2005 campaign that found her team finishing 35-27, the senior captain believes this team will be even more successful.

"I think this season is going to be great because we have some big returners," Powell said.  "Our big hitters are back ... we also have some young players that can contribute both offensively and defensively. Most importantly, [those young players] have really [gelled] well with our team."

With determination, hard work and a little help from her friends, she was able to turn her life around and let the world know how great she could be.

As far as her decision to come to FIU is concerned, Powell doesn't even think twice about it.

"The relationships I've built here will last a lifetime," Powell said. "That alone has made it worthwhile.  I could picture a lot of [my teammates] showing up at my wedding one day."

Headline: Football team announces 2006 recruiting class
Author: Andrew Kameka and Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
It was an all-Florida occasion for the FIU football team Feb. 1 - National Signing Day. On the day when most high school seniors officially declare what college they will attend next Fall, the Golden Panthers received letters of intent from 24 recruits - all of whom are from the state of Florida.

Head coach Don Strock declared the signing day a success, as he announced a class that features seven all-state honorees. The coaching staff began the recruiting process seeking to replace 25 seniors who helped build the program in 2002, and Strock expressed satisfaction with those efforts. 

 "I'm very happy with the quality of this recruiting class," Strock said. "We signed quality players at every position; we didn't just have to settle for what was available."

Topping the list of recruits is Niceville quarterback/kicker John Paul Fraites. Fraites earned first-team all-state honors in 2005 by kicking a perfect 9-of-9 on field-goal attempts and passing for more than 1,300 yards and 16 touchdowns. He was also voted Player of the Year by the Northwest Florida Daily News.

Catching 11 of Fraites's touchdown passes was teammate John Houston Whiddon, a first-team all-state receiver. Whiddon led all receivers in the panhandle area with 49 receptions for 827 yards. The talented wide-out chose to join Fraites at FIU rather than to attend Auburn or Virginia.

The newly-established pipeline from Niceville to FIU also delivered star running back Devon Freeman. The acclaimed back rushed for more than 1,300 yards and 14 touchdowns in 2005 as he earned all-state honors for the second consecutive year. Though Auburn and South Florida sought his talents, Freeman couldn't resist going to University Park. 

 "I chose FIU because the coaching staff has a great background in football," Freeman said. "I really enjoyed the campus when I went for my official visit and some of my [current] teammates are going to be there next year."

FIU also received letters of intent from four offensive linemen, who coaches feel could strengthen a blocking unit that lost four starters from the 2005 roster. 

"We needed to acquire depth, particularly in areas like our offensive line," Strock said. "A lot of these young men will compete for playing time immediately."

Junior college transfer Jeffrey Eugene is one of the players expected to contribute right away. A Miami native, the 6-foot-3 inche, 305-pound guard will return to his hometown to help rebuild an offensive line drained by graduation. 

"We have lost a lot of offensive linemen," Strock said. "Wide receivers are going to get a long look; we lost a lot of wide receivers. Running backs we lost three of, so someone is going to have to come in and be able to play."

FIU also had its share of talented recruits on the other side of the ball. The Golden Panther defense was strengthened by the commitment of Michael Dominguez, ranked number 24 on The Miami Herald's "Top 25 Dade Recruits list." The linebacker of North Miami Beach chose FIU over North Carolina State.

Even more depth was added to the defense with the commitment of Mannie Wellington of 4-A state champion Nease. The five-foot-eight inch, 205-pound linebacker has been a member of the St. Augustine Record All-First Coast team for three consecutive years. 

The commitments to FIU - 12 offensive, nine defensive and two on special teams - form a class that is expected to have an immediate impact on the program. 

"Most of these guys have played in high school championship games,"  Strock said. "They know from watching us play freshmen last year that they're going to get the opportunity to play right away.''

According to Strock, the tough out-of-conference schedule and possibilities of playing next season's home games at the Orange Bowl both helped in bringing in swing recruits. 

Next season's schedule is set with the opener, Sept. 9, at South Florida. The Golden Panthers then come home for their match-up with Bowling Green, though the site of the game is still up in the air with the pending approval for a new stadium. 

 "The schedule sold itself," Strock said.

Out-of-conference games also include trips to Maryland, Miami and Alabama. 

"A fifth-year program, they are going to be playing against elite competition, playing in a new stadium - possibly the Orange Bowl their first year," Strock said. "All of those are pluses."

FIU will also play host to Arkansas State, Louisiana-Monroe, Louisiana-Lafayette and Troy as part of their Sun Belt schedule and will look to improve on their initial full-fledged Division I record of 5-6 in 2005.  

"I think every one of [the recruits] is going to be given the opportunity to compete for playing time," Strock said. "Sometimes, someone just jumps out at you and sometimes we see their hard work, they pick up the system and they are productive for you."
