Subheadline: Students harness tact, protect milk
Author: Chris Cabral / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Ah, college. Conventionally, it is the place where young and hungry minds go to learn the ways of the world and become learned men and women, skilled and industrious adults prepared to tackle life's challenges and succeed in their chosen profession. Yet students who live in dorms often get a different kind of education. They must learn to cope with living among people they've never met, from places they've never been, and annoying habits that will never die. Here is some friendly advice, illustrated with stories from people who lived in the dreams - and the nightmares - of dorm life.



Learn to respect people's boundaries -

no matter how strange



"I used to have a crazy roommate who was really paranoid about people drinking her milk," recalled freshman Michelle Fiole, who lives in Lakeview Hall. "She used to be like, 'Hey everybody, this is my milk. Don't touch it.'" Fiole said.

At times of high stress, which college often induces, people can lash out. "This one time my friend came over and was drinking some milk and she was like, 'Who's milk are you drinking? Is that my milk?'" Fiole continued. 

But two wrongs don't make a right. "She was really angry, and I said it wasn't but it really was her milk, so we had to pour some milk into her carton when she wasn't looking." 

Sometimes roommates can be unusually possessive of their food items. Eating a roommate's food tends to be frowned upon in general though.



Beware of the naked roommate



Some roommates don't mind sharing their stuff - but sometimes they share more than they should. "My roommate likes to walk around naked," Fiole said. "She does it a lot." In some cases, college teaches acceptance. "It used to make me uncomfortable, Fiole said. "Now I'm used to it though."

However, if you're not comfortable with your roommate walking around naked, tell them.



Lower your expectations accordingly



The problems of dorm living can extend far beyond the odd habits of those who live there. "Some idiot keeps pulling the fire alarm at four in the morning," said Freshman Chris Cromer.

"There are loud construction noises in the morning. We have to pay for the meal plan, we have to pay a thousand dollars more than the people who live in Everglades, we don't even get a kitchen â€¦ and there is a giant crack in the sidewalk - if I was in a wheelchair I'd be dead right now. Long story short, Lakeview sucks," Cromer said (in one breath).

Of course, the University assures, Lakeview is not a complete hellhole. It's much nicer than my house. Then again, my house has a hole in the roof, three broken windows and is haunted by the ghost of an old Filipino woman. So maybe that's not the best frame of reference.

The problem may be that many students set the bar too high. The dorms at the University of Miami, for example, are much more expensive  - and I hear they sleep in the cells of an abandoned prison.



Knock before you enter a room



Beyond structural problems with the building itself and the always-pervasive complaints regarding the rates charged, there are the inevitable conflicts that can arise from a lack of common courtesy.

If you don't knock before entering a room, don't be surprised if you see something shocking. 

"My friend walked in on someone having sex," said freshman Vignesh Doraiswamy.  

Stories like this are not uncommon, so remember this cardinal rule: in the words of freshman Liz Greer, "If you're going to fornicate, lock the door to your room first!" This is true for both dorm residents and those who live with their parents.

Yes, living in a dormitory can be difficult. Yet if you harness all the positive energy you can muster, you can make living there a fun experience.

And even if it's terrible, at least you'll have a wealth of fun stories to tell your grandchildren, and their children, and their children's children, until the trauma - I mean memories - fade.

Headline: Feud boosts ratings at expense of brain cells
Subheadline: Trivial Pursuit...a pop culture column
Author: Reuben Pereira / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Are these the dog days of television or what? Many of network television's biggest shows are still on hiatus, the Super Bowl is still two weeks away and the situation in Iraq still isn't changing.

So whom do we turn to in this oh-so-dry period? Enter Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump and you have yourself a media circus. Seriously, I can't believe that this is the best we can do.

The origin of this sleazy tale of perversity and lack of integrity is stuff of legends. It all started when O'Donnell, a host on ABC's "The View," bashed billionaire Trump for publicly humiliating the winner of the Miss USA 2006 beauty pageant for her underage drinking.

O'Donnell argued that Trump's decision to make the young woman apologize was hypocritical considering his failures in both marriage and business.

Within hours, Trump hit back with personal and derogatory comments and there you have it - your three-ring media circus. It's not like the backstory matters anyway.

You're probably thinking, "Who cares?" You certainly don't and neither do I. Too bad most of America does and that's head-scratch worthy to me.

What makes this ridiculous tabloid-worthy story a national media circus? Maybe it's the lack of news. Maybe it's the perverseness of the whole thing. Maybe it's the idea of watching two hated pop culture icons going kamikaze at each other.

I can understand when people attack each other in a professional manner, but acting like schoolyard bullies and attacking each other on the basis of their respective egos is for 5-year-olds. The whole episode lacks integrity, professionalism and decency.

Now, can any of you think what this feud was really about? Treat yourself with a cookie if you answered ratings.

My bet is that when this feud dies down, the only people coming out from this will be Trump and O'Donnell whose shows and web ratings have upped after the feud.

Everything from the tabloids and US Weekly to respected news outlets like CNN, USA Today and The Washington Post have run front-page stories.

You may think it's over now but no, it's still going on. Barbara Walters, Trump's daughter, Madonna and even Angelina Jolie have all been pulled into this debacle with Trump spewing insults at Walters and, more recently, on "Larry King Live" at Jolie.

Everywhere you go you can't escape it. The topic is included on every comedian's routine from late night to stand up to VH1's pop culture shows with spoofs and parodies of the feud all over YouTube.com.

However, the stupidest take on this "way out of hand" feud would have to be the WWE's match between the two. For those of us hoping for a real match, please take your seats. The fight was between two D-grade actors posing as Trump and Rosie, which was won by the Trump drone who smacked a cake in the Rosie impersonator's face, to my delight.

Thinking about it, I would actually be interested in seeing something like a Celebrity Death Match or a Battle Royale between the two. That would be fun to watch and actually worth my time.

Not only would it be a battle to the death between two annoying D-grade celebrities, but also, in a way, a match-up of ideals. Rosie could be the feminist-left-leaning Democrat and Donald would be the chauvinist-right-leaning Republican. 

It would put an end to the whole fiasco between the two for once and for all and pave the way for future battles like maybe Angelina Jolie vs. Jennifer Anniston or Tom Cruise vs. the sane world.

Headline: My Life Experience: Urinating elephant, clowns mark first circus experience
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
I've always hated clowns and I don't really know why. I guess, for me, it's a combination of their creepy makeup, their cannibalistic portrayal in movies and, of course, their clearly satanic mannerisms. When I was little, they caused me to cry and curse the heavens. Because of this fear, I missed out on a childhood staple: the circus. 

With my 21st birthday looming, however, I finally found the courage to attend my first "Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus" performance at the American Airlines Arena. 

My journey to the circus started after seeing an ad in The Miami Herald about its last weekend in town. I was tired of playing videogames and sitting around the house in my pajamas, so I thought, "Why not do something different?" Originally, I was going to take my girlfriend, but plans fell through and I had to find someone else - I had hyped the circus so much that nothing would stop me from going. I called some of my male friends about it, but they declined the invitation and subsequently questioned my sexuality. Finally, someone accepted: Jackie Gadea, an FIU sophomore.

We arrived at the arena at 2 p.m., three hours before the performance was scheduled to begin. After standing in line, Jackie and I eventually reached the box office, where we were informed that all lower level tickets had sold out; the only section left was the nosebleed section. We angrily purchased the tickets.

According to the ad that I saw, an all access pre-show was scheduled for 3:30 p.m., when ticket holders could see the animals before they performed in the arena. The pre-show was anything but all access: the animals were kept either behind fences or inside cages so that the white tigers (and lethargic goats) wouldn't maul the curious children. Nevertheless, it was an experience - the highlight of the pre-show was a spontaneously urinating elephant.

At 4 p.m., the doors to the arena opened. When we reached our seats, we realized that our view was partially obstructed by a wall. I cursed the ticket attendant under my breath. The lights in the arena dimmed and thousands of children simultaneously screamed in ecstasy. The circus had begun.

Some woman in a red, white and blue dress came out and said something. I had no idea what she said because the sound system was not very good, but I assumed she was important.

She introduced the different characters in the circus, but I couldn't hear anything. The only words I understood were "Super amazing" and "Clown of Crunk," the latter of which was a reference to the sole black clown in the circus. He disappointedly looked nothing like Lil' Jon. 

Also, I noticed that nobody in the circus said anything - the audio was prerecorded. The circus' story involved a family who aspired to be in the circus. Each family member became a different character - the father became the ringleader, the mom turned into an acrobat and the daughter became a dancer who happened to look like a stripper. Dan, the son, couldn't make up his mind, though. As a result, the lady in the multi-colored outfit brought out the different circus acts to give Dan some ideas.

Despite the lack of realism permeating the story, the circus was absolutely amazing. I saw elephants dance, tigers play dead and the "Clown of Crunk" perpetuate stereotypes. There was also a band that played instrumental versions of popular songs by artists such as Gwen Stefani, but we couldn't see them from our horrible seats.

Of course, the clowns made an appearance, but they weren't the demonic cannibals from my childhood - they were actually pretty funny, particularly during a food fight skit that involved all sorts of pies and other delectable confections.

Because the performance was sold out, Jackie and I decided to leave early to beat the crowds to the parking lot, so I never did see Dan achieve his lofty goal of working at a circus. Still, my first time at a circus was an unforgettable experience and I realized that my fear of clowns was completely irrational. 

Clowns are normal people like you and me - except with creepy makeup. Now that I've experienced my first circus performance and thoroughly enjoyed it, I can't wait until the "Clown of Crunk" returns to Miami.

Headline: Lectures, workshops promote cervical cancer awareness
Author: Lalinda De La Fuente / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
According to the American Cancer Society, the most common cancer in women after breast cancer is cervical cancer. With the recent introduction of a vaccine and with January being Cervical Cancer Awareness Month, Biscayne Bay and University Park campuses' University Health Services/Wellness Centers and the Women's Center are hosting a variety of events throughout the month to educate the public on the issue.

The events for Cervical Cancer Awareness Month will begin on Jan. 18 at Panther Square from 5 p.m. -7 p.m. with "The Late Day Latte," an educational discussion with BBC Health Center nurse practitioner Yolanda Santisteban, who has been with the University for 10 years.

Mariela Gabaroni, Assistant Director for the University Park Wellness Center, stresses education on the matter.

 "It's very important for women to become aware of their body, not just with cervical cancer," she said.  "It's about improving quality of life."

Aimee Fernandez, assistant director for the BBC Wellness Center, also emphasizes the need for knowledge on the subject and how close it hits to home. 

"This is common," Fernandez said. "Don't make the mistake of thinking that this is not relevant to you. At the BBC campus alone, one in five pap smears conducted are abnormal and of all sexually active people at least 50 percent will get HPV."

According to the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, each year 14,000 women will be diagnosed with the illness. Of those women, more than 3,900 women will die from the disease.

Awareness at FIU becomes even more pertinent when the National Cancer Institute puts Hispanic and African-American women at greater risk of contracting the disease. Hispanics and African-Americans make up 53 and 13.5 percent of FIU's student body, respectively. Of the entire student body, more than half, 57.5 percent are female.

Recently, the human papilloma virus, a group of more than 100 viruses, was identified as the chief cause of cervical cancer.

In July 2006, the Federal Drug Administration approved a vaccine that protects against four different HPV strains, two of which, HPV 16 and 18, are those that cause most cervical cancer cases.

The vaccine, called Gardasil, manufactured by Merck and Company, also prevents against HPV 6 and 11, which are responsible for 90% of genital warts.

The HPV vaccine is recommended for girls and women ages 9-26. Although the vaccine protects females from the main cause of cervical cancer, other causes are still possible and pap smears should be regular in sexually active women over the age of 21 to detect abnormal cells that can develop into cervical cancer.

Despite the fact that the vaccine only protects against one cause of cervical cancer, FIU is offering the vaccine at both campuses for the Spring 2007 semester. The vaccine will cost $130 per dose and consists of three doses over an eight-month period.

Gabaroni heralds the vaccine as an important tool against cervical cancer but still stresses the need for knowledge.

"People have a false sense of security with the vaccine," she said. "I encourage the workshops and lectures. I'm big on people making informed choices."

At this month's upcoming educational lectures and workshops at both campuses, stress will be placed on those sexual choices. Casandra Roache, the health educator at UP, warns against ignorance on the matter.

"It's not hereditary. It comes from the choices that you make. Cervical cancer is not something you play with," Roache said.

Hospitality and tourism management major Jamin Stilley recalls an instance when she became aware of cervical cancer.

"My mother slipped me a magazine clipping about the vaccine recently," Stilley said. "She then reminded me to call my doctor about a hundred times after that. I thought she was crazy at first but after learning about it I do feel like it's a good move and with further information will probably get the vaccine."

Aside from the vaccine, free pap smears will also be offered through BBC Health Services from Jan. 23 through Feb. 28 on a first-come, first-served basis. Otherwise, pap smears are always available at both campuses' health centers for $28.

The awareness month will conclude on Jan. 25 at Bay Vista housing where "The 'A' Word: Abstinence and You," will be presented by the BBC Women's Center.

This interactive program, a part of the Wild Succulent Women Series, speaks about abstinence and HPV/cervical cancer prevention and takes place at 9 p.m. in Bay Vista Housing's common room.

For more details concerning all the upcoming events, contact information for both the UP and BBC Wellness Centers can be found at the Health Services website www.fiu.edu/~health.

Headline: Club fair gives varied groups chance to recruit, earn points
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
The Student Organizations Council, the governing council for more than 100 campus organizations at University Park, will be hosting its spring club fair from Jan. 22-25 on the first floor of the Graham Center. The fair, which takes place from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. each day, will give students the opportunity to showcase their organizations and recruit new members.

Unlike last semester's club fair, which used a Hawaiian theme and included hula skirts and free airbrushed t-shirts, this semester's fair will have a Hollywood theme. Despite the differences in themes between the fall and spring club fairs, the scheduling remains the same: Monday is for academic and engineering clubs; Tuesday for social clubs; Wednesday for arts, health, and sports clubs; and Thursday for business, political, religious and service clubs.

 According to SOC President Francys Crevier, some of the giveaways for the fair include Hollywood-themed keychains and postcards.

"There's going to be a guy who takes your picture for the keychains and postcards, which will have a Hollywood background," Crevier said.

Aside from giveaways, there will be a contest for the best-decorated club tables, which will be judged by the Campus Life department. Each day, one club will be chosen to win a $25 allotment to its existing budget, according to Crevier.

Aylin Ruiz, president of the community service organization Service for Peace, has already discussed decoration ideas with club members.

"We've thrown around a couple of ideas like putting a Service for Peace movie on a film reel," Ruiz said. "We're also thinking about incorporating the red carpet."

Although clubs are not required to participate in the club fair, there are incentives for participants.

"Clubs receive one point for being there," Crevier said.

The SOC website www.fiu.edu/~soc states that a club must have at least 15 points to be eligible for funding from SOC.

Ruiz further stresses the importance of collecting points.

"To clubs, points are money," Ruiz said. "The fair gives clubs a point for being there, a point for decorating your table." 

If clubs want points from the club fair, however, they're going to have to wake up earlier than usual. Any organization interested in a table has to arrive early in the morning to secure one before they run out because space is limited.

"We reserve most of the tables in the Graham Center that week, and it's first-come, first-serve for clubs," Crevier said. 

For more information about the Spring 2007 club fair, visit the SOC office in GC 2300.

Headline: STREAK HALTED: Team effort ends men's losing skid
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With an undermanned squad for the second consecutive game, senior guard Johwen Villegas - hobbled by a left knee sprain and the possibility of a sixth consecutive loss - the question became who would step up for the Golden Panthers Jan. 13 against Sun Belt foe Denver. 

The answer came in the unlikely duo of freshmen Cedric Essola and guard Erick Nsangou - both natives of Cameroon - whose second half play led the Golden Panthers (7-10, 2-5 SBC) to a slim 61-59 victory over the Pioneers (2-15, 1-6) at Pharmed Arena.

Essola played his way to a team-high 12 points, seven rebounds and three blocks. 

Nsangou complimented him with 10 rebounds and eight assists. 

After the game, the lanky Essola said it felt good to help end the losing skid and talked about his break out performance.

"In the first half, I missed a lot of shots, but coach told me that it is impossible to make every shot, so keep shooting the ball. And that's what I did," Essola said. "I wanted to win this game so bad. Especially after losing like five games. Our goal is to win the conference and I want to help us do that."

According to Nsangou, Essola's performance didn't come as a surprise to him at all.

"I was impressed but I knew that he can do that. He just needs to keep his confidence and get in the game. It was tough but we really wanted to win this game and that was our driving force tonight," Nsangou said.

Early on, the Golden Panthers looked like a team that desperately wanted to snap a five game losing skid. 

Despite the fact that junior guard Chris Fuller picked up two early fouls and a limping Villegas missed on his first five attempts, good defensive play kept the Golden Panthers competitive. 

After Pioneers leading scorer Deshawn Walker buried a three pointer to open the game on a 5-0 run, sophomore forward Alex Galindo hit three consecutive fast-break lay-ups to bring FIU back.

After trading baskets, Walker was able to penetrate and hit a tough floater in traffic to put the Pioneers up by one, 14-13, before the Golden Panthers would erupt.

Fresh off the bench, freshman forward Nikola Gacesa drilled a three pointer that ignited a 13-0 run, to give FIU its biggest lead of the contest, 26-14.  

Despite being outplayed on both ends of the floor, Walker buried a three pointer as the first half expired to pull Denver's deficit to eight, 29-21. 

Building off the momentum from their last second bomb, the Pioneers picked up all aspects of their game early in the second half and pulled within three points, 39-36, with 13:53 remaining - eventually taking a 43-41 lead off a short jumper on the left baseline from forward Joe Jackson. 

The Golden Panthers' hot first half shooting seemed to disappear. 

After trading baskets, the Golden Panthers found themselves trailing 52-50 with 5:15 left in regulation.

From that moment on, it was Essola time. 

The lanky Essola used his speed and length to toy with Pioneers center Chris Timms, as he hit two consecutive jumpers in the post.

On the other end of the floor, Essola was just as effective, blocking a shot attempt and altering shots he could not get to. 

FIU would open up a 58-51 advantage that provided some breathing room, but the Pioneers came right back and had a chance to tie the game with nine seconds remaining. Essola tipped away a Denver 3-point prayer as time expired. 

Denver's Tyler Bullock led all scorers with 16 points. 

Walker added 13 points and Alan Cox chipped in with nine for the Pioneers.

Despite fouling out with 3:20 remaining Galindo still finished with 11 points and six rebounds. Fuller added nine points and four rebounds.

Even with a much smaller team, the Golden Panthers won the battle of the boards 51-37 and had more points in the paint (28-20).

Sophomore forward Brad Larson snatched seven rebounds and did his part to frustrate the big men of the Pioneers.

"Brad Larson is like a rabid pit-bull. He just gets his hands on everything and he is all over the court," coach Sergio Rouco said. "I am extremely proud of my kids because again we out-rebounded another team; we had 13 assists to only seven turnovers. When you get the production that you get from our freshmen today we are hard to beat."

The Golden Panthers will look to stay on the winning track when they face off against another Sun Belt opponent in North Texas, led by guard Kendrick Davis, Jan. 18 at home.

Headline: McGwire has no one to blame but himself
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
The voting for the 2007 induction class into the Baseball Hall of Fame has passed and two very deserving players, Cal Ripken Jr. and Tony Gwinn, were voted.

However, an almost equally covered story was that of who wasn't selected - Mark McGwire. 

It's hard to imagine that a player with 583 home runs and 12 All-Star game appearances would not be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Not to mention that he, along with Sammy Sosa, was an instrumental part in bringing baseball back in to the national spotlight in that famous summer of 1998.

But it's also hard to blame voters for leaving him out due to an overwhelming suspicion of steroid use. Now, I know there's never been any solid proof that Big Mac took steroids. You can point to several factors: how his home run numbers, along with his biceps, inflated dramatically; Jose Canseco's tell-all autobiography; or his famous question dodging in front of Congress.

Hypothetically, if this evidence was brought to trial, though, none of it would ever hold up in a courtroom and the case would be thrown out.

Basically, the Hall of Fame voters kept McGwire out despite a lack of hard evidence, and some people believe that's truly unfair. How can these voters be swayed by hearsay and rumors?

Well, it's pretty simple. We all are.

Let's say you're at a party and meet an extremely attractive member of the opposite sex (or of the same sex. There's no discrimination in this column). 

You and this person talk for the entire night, share many laughs and even dance a little. Prospects are looking so high that, by the end of the night, the two of you have already exchanged numbers and are locking lips in a bathroom.

The next day, you feel great. You're sharing the story with all your friends, maybe even some family members.

But then you run into your friend, Jose, who tells you that this person has an STD. Jose knows first hand this person has an STD because he claims he passed them along to this person. 

Even though Jose is of ill repute and not fully trustworthy, you're going to have second thoughts on whether you call that person for a second rendezvous, right?

Now, let's say you decide that Jose is too much of a shady character to be trusted, so you go and plan a second date with this person anyway. You are going to ask this person if they have an STD, no matter how rude it's going to come off. After all, this person is very attractive and the two of you hit it off greatly.

At dinner, you casually segue toward the topic of STDs and after a couple of minutes, you slip off the question: "Have you ever had an STD?"

"Oh, come on," the person replies. "I'm not here to talk about the past."

You ask the question again.

"I'm not here to talk about the past," the person replies again.

And again.

"I'm not here to talk about the past. I'm here to be positive about this subject."

I have a feeling that by this point you're highly considering sneaking out a window in the restaurant's bathroom. And there's a really good chance you'll never call the person again.

So, let's recap. Even though the person never said they didn't have an STD, they never said they did. 

And even though you don't trust Jose, you're still taking his word. Instead of giving this person the benefit of the doubt, you took the shaky evidence as proof and now that person is heart-broken.

Sadly, it was McGwire who made the bed he's lying on. Instead of dodging the steroid question (and basically admitting guilt) in front of Congress, Big Mac should have either lied out right or been honest and said he wants to help baseball clean up.

It was those few minutes of testimony that screwed up his chances at being a first-ballot Hall of Famer. 

In the end, though, it's all Jose Canseco's fault.

Headline: Women's basketball losing streak reaches four games
Author: Magally Estrella / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The women's basketball team suffered its fourth-straight loss Jan. 13 in the Pharmed Arena against Denver in a Sun Belt Conference, falling 74-61. 

Denver (9-6, 4-2 Sun Belt) never trailed by more than two points the entire game. 

Even though FIU (9-8, 3-4 Sun Belt) shot better from the floor, 46.3 percent to Denver's 42.4 percent, it also committed more turnovers that helped Denver go up by as many as 20 points. Denver converted FIU's 28 turnovers into 28 points.

Center Lasma Jekabsone had a game-high 22 points and went 9-for-13 from the field. Guard LaQuetta Ferguson scored 14 points for her team, all coming in the second half. Jekabsone and Ferguson each added six rebounds for the Golden Panthers.

It was a close game throughout much of the first half. In the first seven minutes of the game, when Denver scored a basket, FIU answered right back. 

But after a few missed baskets and turnovers from FIU, Denver was all of a sudden up by nine.

FIU's spark of energy came with five minutes remaining in the first half. Jekabsone started the run, hitting a jumper. 

After a few missed attempts from Denver, FIU pulled within three when guard Iva Ciglar scored off a lay-up, making the score 25-22. 

But after hitting seven unanswered points, Denver enjoyed a 10-point lead going into halftime.

"We didn't play the best we could. We let them penetrate and shoot [and] it wasn't too good of a performance," Jekabsone said.

At the start of the second half, the Golden Panthers committed five turnovers in the first eight minutes that aided Denver to go up 61-41.

FIU closed within nine, its smallest deficit of the second half, with 1:52 left in the game.

"We're making mistakes that shouldn't be done. We're turning the ball over a lot, so that's missed chances at the basket that we didn't get. We're getting shots but we're not making our shots, so us not making our shots and they making their shots hurt us. It's hard to come back from 20 points deficit when you can't stop them from scoring and we can't score," assistant coach Desma Thomas said.

The women's basketball team will host North Texas Jan. 18 at 5:30 p.m.

Following the game against North Texas, the womens' basketball team next two games will be away against Louisiana-Monroe and New Orleans.

Their last win came on Jan. 4 against conference foe South Alabama in 56-41 victory.

Headline: Younger Shula enters the race for Dolphins head coaching vacancy
Author: Steven Wine / AP Sports Writer
&nbsp;
Mike Shula interviewed for the job Saturday, a person familiar with the team's search said Tuesday. 

The person requested anonymity because the Dolphins have declined to identify candidates.

Shula's dad, Don, coached the Dolphins for 26 years, holds the NFL record with 347 victories and is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Hiring the younger Shula would mean a swap of coaches with Alabama. 

He was fired by the Crimson Tide in November and replaced by Nick Saban, who left the Dolphins on Jan. 3 after two seasons.

Two other candidates have interviewed with Miami twice: former Atlanta Falcons coach Jim Mora and Georgia Tech coach Chan Gailey. 

Management met with 12 coaches during the first round of interviews, which ended last Wednesday.

The 41-year-old Shula went 26-23 in four years at Alabama. 

The Crimson Tide fired him after they went 6-6 during the 2006 regular season and lost for the fourth year in a row to Southeastern Conference rival Auburn.

Shula said he left Alabama in better shape than the program he inherited, which was weakened by NCAA sanctions.

Shula was a Dolphins ballboy when his dad coached the team. He has spent 15 years as an NFL assistant, most recently in 2000-02 as Miami's quarterbacks coach. Former Dolphins coach Nick Saban is coaching the Crimson Tide.

Headline: Editorial:  New Lakeview dorms should be less expensive
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Despite construction setbacks, Lakeview Hall opened its doors on schedule at the start of the 2006 Fall semester.

In its haste to open Lakeview's doors on time, housing administration began moving students into the still-unfinished dorm only four days after the fire marshal approved it for occupancy. 

New residents in what was billed as an award-worthy residence hall were welcomed with cold, dirty running water and faulty cable connections.

Keeping them company were the subcontractors who filed in and out of the dorm throughout the semester, working out "kinks" - as Director of Student Life Joe Mattachione described them - like replacing carpets and linoleum and re-painting the walls.

James Wassenaar, the executive director of student affairs operations and auxiliary services, blamed those rough edges on the construction setbacks. By his logic, if construction had gone smoothly, his crew would have had two months to add those finishing touches.

Two months later, The Beacon returned to see how Lakeview looked after its "kinks" had been worked out, only to find that carpets were still being replaced and walls were still being re-painted. 

What's more, new nuisances had started popping up since opening day: elevators had begun creaking, and it turned out that it wasn't just kinks that were being fixed, but also cracks and holes and other issues that required heavy construction.

Throughout the course of last semester, Lakeview residents were routinely woken up by the sound of drilling and other construction equipment as early as 8 a.m., including Saturdays.

Wassenaar claimed that most problems had been solved within the first weeks of the semester and promised that the rest would be fixed by the end of that week.

This was on Oct. 26, 2006. 

Two weeks into the 2007 Spring semester, the elevator is still creaking and, according to residents, has begun to break down. In the laundry rooms, washing machines leak and dryers don't dry.

More troubling is that the security equipment present in other halls has yet to be installed in Lakeview. 

Other residence halls have cameras throughout their hallways and their doors have sensors that sound an alarm if left open. Lakeview still has none of this. Students' convenience is important, but their safety is essential. 

Setbacks that occurred nearly a year ago are no longer an excuse. Wassenaar needs to ensure that Lakeview is made as comfortable - and as safe - as every other residence hall, immediately. 

Moreover, students who don't want to face a second semester of irritating noise, faulty installations and unsafe living quarters should be allowed to opt out of their year-long residential contracts.

Finally, for those who stay behind, the University should offer compensation. At $4,048 a semester, Lakeview is the most expensive hall on campus. Lakeview residents should not have to pay more than others, for a lesser product. At the very least, for as long as construction continues at Lakeview, its housing rates should be discounted.

Headline: Wage raise riles Republicans
Author: Roque Corona / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Bravo, Congress, and hooray to all those hard working Americans making a lousy $5.15 an hour. The House of Representatives approved a $2.10-an-hour raise in the federal minimum wage Jan. 10 - a move which many Democrats view as a momentous sign of a new direction on Capitol Hill.

The wage increase would be implemented over a two year period, and according to economists, would boost salaries for nearly 13 million American workers - 9.8 percent of the United States workforce.

Republicans, however, have argued that the legislation would reduce the number of available jobs and become a detriment to small business around the country.

And without tax cuts for small business included in the bill, it is likely that Senate Republicans will block the measure.

Both those arguments, however, are highly misleading and contradicted by a wide array of data compiled by various sources.

The truth is there was no evidence of job loss from the last minimum wage increase, and the number of small businesses in states with a higher minimum wage has shown to increase rather than decrease. 

In fact, a 1998 Economic Policy Institute study found no significant job loss related to the minimum wage increase of 1996-97.

Moreover, information from the Center for American Progress shows that small business employment actually increased by 9.4 percent in states with higher minimum wage, as opposed to 6.6 percent in states that were at the federal minimum wage level.

Let's go further back, shall we? After the 1990-91 federal minimum wage increase, economists David Card and Alan Krueger conducted studies that showed there was no quantifiable negative impact on employment due to the increase.  So rather than employment decreasing as the Republicans continue to say it will, past data actually supports the idea that it will actually increase. 

Their idea that the minimum wage increase will hurt small business is also wrong.

A study by the Fiscal Policy Institute of state minimum wages found no evidence of negative effects on small business.  

In addition, between 1998 and 2003, the number of small businesses increased by 5.5 percent in states with a higher minimum wage, in contrast to 4.2 percent in states that were at the lower federal minimum wage level. 

And data supplied by the Center for American Progress shows that the average business can completely cover the cost of the new minimum wage by increasing their revenue by less than 0.1 percent.

So where are all these negative impacts that the Republicans are speaking of?

For nearly a decade the Republicans have refused to raise the wage floor from $5.15, yet have continually allowed for Congressional pay raises. 

Our delegates in Congress are making $165,200 a year, which comes out to about $79 an hour.  

Meanwhile, 13 million hard working Americans are stuck making the bare minimum - hardly enough to support themselves or their families.  

To put it all in perspective, without this increase, a family of three supported by one minimum wage earner will live approximately $5,400 below the federal poverty line.

So the tax cuts may not be a bad thing, but the Republicans shouldn't sacrifice the entire bill and its eventual helpful effects on a large percent of the population for an addendum that is essentially unnecessary.

The Republicans need to step aside in this argument and give the bottom half of the American workers some much needed help.

Headline: College of Law building opens after financial struggles
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In preparation for the February dedication of the College of Law building, George Corton, the college's director of development, reviewed the 68 names to be etched on the Donor Wall, a tribute to the College of Law's benefactors.

"From the start we knew this was going to have to be a public-private partnership," Corton said.

The completion of the College's new 153,000 square foot building and the receipt of accreditation in record time have not come cheap. Yet thanks to generous donors and a few unexpected surprises, the College of Law stands to celebrate its accomplishments in a three-day celebration alongside Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Governor Charlie Crist and Congressmen Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart, among other prominent guests. The building itself is named after the congressmen's late father, Rafael Diaz-Balart.

As construction of the building continued in 2005 and 2006, costs unexpectedly rose. According to Corton, total costs of construction reached $40 million - an $8 million spike from the original numbers. The college found itself in debt, cutting expenses however it could.

"A lot of things were scaled down, like the chandeliers in the atrium," Corton said.

However, at the end of the 2006 fiscal year the state legislature passed a bill to finance the completion of the construction of public buildings whose costs had increased. The college received $5.3 million of the total $60 million appropriated by the legislature.

Leonard Strickman, the college's dean, called the bill a "godsend."

 "It allowed us to pay off some of the debt we had accumulated on construction costs and permitted us to purchase most of the furniture and over half of the technology without having to borrow any further," Strickman said.

Corton agreed. "At that point, all our worries went away," Corton said.

The college also received a big surprise from an unlikely source in what would become the single largest gift it ever received.

"We received an unexpected gift from an anonymous donor that was a great help," Strickman said.

Corton explained that then Florida Attorney General Crist entered into a settlement with an anonymous firm against which the state had brought suit. The $3 million settlement was equally divided among Florida's four public law schools, each receiving $750,000. Thanks to Florida's Major Gifts program, the College of Law received an additional 70 percent on the original amount for a total of $1,275,000.

The College has used those funds toward the endowment of its largest professorship.

The second largest gift received by the college was from the family of Carlos Costa - an American pilot shot down by Cuban fighter jets in 1996. The Costa Foundation made a gift of $500,000 that was matched dollar-for-dollar by the State's Capital Facilities Matching Program for a total of $1 million.

The College's successes have continued into the new fiscal year. According to Corton, the first quarterly review yielded positive results. 

"It may sound foolish but our goal this year is as much as we can get," Strickman said.

Strickman said that the college's small and young alumni base forces it to rely more heavily on major gifts, making it difficult to quantify fundraising goals.

Older law schools tend to enjoy large alumni bases from which they obtain a large portion of their yearly fundraising objectives.

Nonetheless, Strickman has many new goals for 2007, including additional professorships and student scholarships, a lecture series, and greater support for special programs like the college's law clinics and trial practices.

For now, preparations continue for the dedication event.

Strickman estimated costs for the dedication in the vicinity of $175,000 to $180,000.

To front these costs, the college again looked to its private partnerships. Through sponsorships received from numerous donors including Citibank, Citigroup and Greenberg Taurig, the College raised $180,000 for the dedication event.

"Private funding is absolutely essential to the growth and development of the College of Law," Strickman said. "While we are funded by the state and by student tuition, we cannot become the great law school we aspire to be with only those two sources."

Headline: Middle East analyst discusses Jihad
Author: Maria Concha /Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The use of Jihad - or holy war - propaganda, will be the topic of this month's Middle East Society's guest speaker Nadav Samin, a Middle East analyst and Arabic linguist for the U.S. government who will present "How the Internet is Used to Advance Jihad" at the Biscayne Bay Campus Jan. 21.

Samin will be discussing the use of symbols by Jihad propagandists to push a particular understanding of world events, and the broader implications of the Internet for the Jihad movement now and into the near future.

"Understanding these implications are significant for the larger public relations strategy of the U.S. in the Middle East, since the Internet now functions alongside satellite television as the jihadist's primary vehicle for influencing opinion among Arab and Muslim youth and populations more generally," said Shlomi Dinar, assistant professor and director of the Middle East Society. 

Samin is also an adjunct professor of political science at Hunter College in New York, where he teaches a course on the jihad movement. He has published articles and book reviews on Middle East issues in the Wall Street Journal and Arab Studies Journal. Furthermore, he regularly writes analytical reports for the federal government and local law enforcement agencies.

"He was chosen [to speak at FIU] because his topic is absolutely vital to our understanding of how Jihadist operate in our technological society," said Peter Craumer, international relations professor.

Headquartered at BBC, MES is a component of FIU's department of international relations and geography. 

According to Dinar, the ultimate goal of the organization is to ensure that FIU is a center of debate and learning on matters concerning the Middle East.

A way to accomplish this goal is by bringing prominent guest speakers to FIU throughout the academic year, which allows students an opportunity to learn about some of the most vexing policy issues of our time.

Samin's remarks will come just after President Bush delivered a seminal speech on U.S. policy in the region. Understanding the motives and tools behind the Jihad movement is a key component of that policy.

"Any student who does not attend these lectures, [or] challenge and probe these speakers is missing a great opportunity," Dinar said.

MES is a membership organization in its second year of activity. For a nominal fee of $35, members who generally come from the local community enjoy several privileges throughout the year. In an effort to encourage FIU students to become involved in the organization, membership is free for them. 

"MES hopes to become a funding source for student scholarships and auxiliary programming related to the department of international relations," Dinar said.

The MES presents approximately six lectures throughout the academic year. Past speakers have included published scholars, featured pundits and award-winning reporters. Last November, MES hosted former Florida State Senator Bob Graham, who spoke on the situation in Iraq and possible scenarios for the future. Before the year ends, the MES will host two additional events, Feb. 25 and March 11, although the names of the guest speakers are not confirmed. 

"How the Internet is Used to Advance Jihad" will be presented Jan. 21, 2 p.m. at BBC's Academic I Building, room 194. Although the event is free to degree-seeking students, attendants are encouraged to become annual members. For more information about MES, visit http://www.fiu.edu/~mes.

Headline: Security issues plague Lakeview
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
After living in Lakeview Hall for a semester, freshman Bianca D'An decided she'd had enough. A combination of problems - ranging from Lakeview construction drilling to roommate conflicts - caused the fourth floor Lakeview North resident to pack up her belongings during the winter break and move back into her parents' home in North Miami. Although D'An cannot break her binding housing contract that requires her to live in Lakeview for a year, and although she technically still has a room in the residence hall, D'An would rather make the long commute than stay in an uncomfortable living situation.

"I pay to live here but I'm not living here. I didn't feel comfortable in my living situation, and nothing was done about it," D'An said. "I got fed up with it and I just decided I didn't want to live here anymore. I thought I was paying too much money for a building that's not even built right."

In the Oct. 26, 2006 issue of The Beacon, Lakeview residents raised issues concerning construction in the article, "After the move: New dorm invokes mixed feelings." Complaints ranged from creaky elevators to lack of hot water, to drilling on Saturday mornings. James Wassenaar, executive director of student affairs, operations and auxiliary services, had said in the article that the majority of problems had been "successfully resolved," and the rest of the minor projects still occurring would be completed by the end of that week.

Lakeview Hall's ribbon-cutting ceremony is taking place Jan. 19 at 11 a.m. in order to "mark the final completion of the project," according to Wassenaar. As of Jan. 16, Wassenaar said minor construction problems were still being completed throughout the end of last semester. These projects included carpeting the lobby's linoleum and finishing the outside landscaping.

"It was the touch-up of paint, adjusting of elevators, those kinds of things," Wassenaar said. "We had lingering issues through December, but the vast majority of [minor projects] were done."

Wassenaar also said the re-paving of the front driveway, which began Jan. 12, should be complete by Jan. 16 and should be "the last of the disruptions."

As for the complaints reported in the Oct. 26 article, Wassenaar said that the minor inconveniences regarding the fine-tuning of the building could not be helped if Lakeview Hall had to open its doors to residents as scheduled.

"We pushed to ensure the building opened on time. As a result, the students were going to experience some disruption," Wassenaar said.

Aside from the consistent complaints regarding faulty facilities and how they disrupt the day to day lives of the residents, another major concern that has been brought up is the issue of safety in Lakeview Hall, or its lack thereof.

Wassenaar held a meeting with the student representatives of the Residence Hall Association in October that dealt with "issues relating to the further enhancement of security." As of Jan. 16, security cameras and door sensors that are supposed to alert the front desk of doors left propped open were "in the process of being installed," Wassenaar said.

Overall, Wassenaar said this semester will run more smoothly for Lakeview residents.

"It will be a very pleasant Spring semester given that all the construction has been completed," he said.

Danielle Reid, a freshman living on the third floor of Lakeview South, said she had problems with lack of hot water and drilling in the mornings throughout the first few weeks of moving in.

As of the beginning of the Spring semester, however, Reid said the elevators, which sound like a "rollercoaster ride," are frequently out of service, and the fire alarms are still going off constantly. However, she was indifferent to these technical difficulties.

"I understand. Nothing's perfect. Deal with it. If you want it to be quiet, go to a monastery," Reid said.

Freshman Geoff Haefling is also a resident living on the fourth floor of Lakeview North. He said when he first moved in to the residence hall, he did not notice any major problems.

"Then everything started to break down, and they wouldn't fix it for a week," Haefling said.

Haefling also said that to this day, the two Lakeview North elevators are out of service two or three times a week, he still has problems connecting to the Internet, the elevators and hallways are always filled with trash, the washers and dryers don't always work, and there are power surges every afternoon at a certain time.

Haefling also brought up the issue of safety. He said when he came back to Lakeview Hall after winter break the front door of Lakeview North was broken. At night, residents had to call the RA on duty in order to be allowed to come inside, but during the day, the door was propped open. Haefling also said at one point, the back door to the stairwell was propped open.

"I didn't feel safe because anyone could get in," Haefling said. "If anyone came in, no one would know. Something could happen and no one would know unless there was a witness."

Despite the lack of security, Haefling enjoys living at Lakeview Hall.

"I've had a lot of fun here. I've made so many friends," he said.

D'An also raised concerns regarding safety. 

Elizabeth Raftery, a freshman living on the sixth floor of Lakeview South, did have problems at the beginning of the semester with the air conditioning in her room. She said her unit was blowing dust into the room, which required her to buy a filter. Her room also lacked hot water. Raftery said that these issues have since then been resolved, and her experience in Lakeview is very positive.

Raftery also said she does not feel unsafe about living in Lakeview Hall.

"It's such a close-knit community, you can spot someone who doesn't belong immediately. You'll never find one individual walking by themselves," Raftery said.

Lakeview Hall was approved for official occupancy by the fire marshal on Aug. 16, 2006, after 16 months of construction, and students were allowed to move in four days later. This was possible despite construction setbacks due to the active 2005 hurricane season, but as a result, Lakeview Hall could not be fully finished by the time it was scheduled to allow students to move in.

Consisting of 825 beds, Lakeview Hall residencies are primarily for freshman and graduate students who can choose between a four-bedroom single suite for $4,048 or a two-bedroom double suite for $3,496 per semester.

Headline: Students search for elusive Florida monster
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Close encounters with a huge, hairy mysterious species; government conspiracies and townspeople infatuated with an ape-like creature in the Everglades. Sounds like a summer blockbuster, right?

Footprints, a documentary less than 15-minutes long by eight former and current FIU students, explores the mystery behind South Florida's legendary Skunk Ape.

This mysterious creature is among one of the many unknown species like the Loch Ness Monster, Big Foot, the Abominable Snowman and El Chupacabra that has captured many imaginations and attracted much attention.

The group - Romy Santana, Kallie Burke, Kirmaya Cevallos, Maria Delgado, Claudia Echeverria, Juan Carlos Gonzalez, Lino La Rosa and Luis Vale - took three months to produce the film on a $750 budget.

Footprints uses actual home video footage shot by individuals who managed to capture the Skunk Ape running across the Everglades, testimonies from experts, and interviews with local towns' people in Everglades City who have grown up around the legend.

"There are a lot of credible people out there who admit that they believe in the Skunk Ape," Echeverria said.

According to eye witness accounts in the film, the creature is a cross between a man and primate that stands on its two legs. Its name comes from the powerful odor it emits.

David Shealy, who established the Skunk Ape Research Center in Naples, is among many in the film who claim he has seen the creature first hand. 

It was Cevallos who first heard about Shealy, while on vacation in Naples. After learning about the Skunk Ape and Shealy's center, she told the rest of the group members and curiosity took care of the rest.

"When we put the ideas on the table, we had an idea of doing a documentary on some kind of disease or Santeria," Santana said, who graduated from FIU December 2006. "We went with the [Skunk Ape] idea because it's something that you can research and it's something refreshing."

All the students wrote, directed and produced the film as their final assignment for their advanced videography class. Associate professor Bert Delgado, who taught the class, grouped students into teams and told them to produce a film, whether it be a music video, drama, documentary, drama or thriller.

"I seldom use the word excellent. This was very close to excellent if not excellent," Delgado said.

Along with the 'A' they received for the final project, the students received major publicity for Footprints. On Jan. 2, the Miami Herald ran a front page story on their documentary.

"We always thought this would stay as a school project. We never thought it would escalate and gain as much attention as it did," Echeverria said.

Besides the Miami Herald story, National Public Radio discussed their documentary on the air and producers from "Good Morning America" inquired about it.

The group said they plan to enter the film in more film festivals and put some clips of the film on YouTube.com.

The fame and success they are receiving didn't come that easy. During their three months of production, they recorded 50 hours of video and managed to edit it down to just less than 15 minutes.

Besides sacrificing their weekends, they took some extra risk in order to make sure they got the best shots.

During their second shoot, they were filming scenic shots of the Everglades at 8 a.m. on State Road 41 when they started to hear a growl get closer and closer. Knowing it surly wasn't a Skunk Ape, the production crew quickly darted back to their vehicles.

"We never knew what it was," Echeverria said. "The boys were the first ones to go to the car."

After the countless interview and hours of being engulfed in the Everglade's odors, the group is still somewhat on the fence about its existence.

"I think there's something out there, I don't know what, but there's something out there," Santana said. "If you go to Everglades City, everyone tells you that there's something. A lot of people truly believe that the government is trying to do something."

"If it's true, it will be the discovery of the century," Echeverria said. "I think it's a fifty-fifty thing. This creature has been seen all over the world."

Headline: Fraternities: not just for UP
Author: Alexandra McAnarney / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the Spring semester in full swing, the Greek organization Tau Kappa Epsilon is looking beyond University Park to find prospective members this year.

"Meet the Tekes," an event that will be hosted by TKE being held Jan. 18 at Biscayne Bay Campus in the Wolfe University Center Ballroom, room 244A, from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30p.m. 

There they will be recruiting members and presenting the different opportunities the fraternity has to offer.

According to Jerry Campos, vice president of TKE, this will be the first time in three years that the fraternity comes to BBC.	

"Here [at BBC] we've had fraternities come in the past from [UP]. The Tekes have come before to do rushes [as well as] the black fraternities but we really haven't had much activity in that sense," said Rafael Zapata, assistant director of Campus Life for BBC. 

Tekes, however, will not be the only Greek members present at the event.

Three guest speakers from different Greek councils will also be present.

A representative from the PanHellenic council, which is in charge of the sororities; National PanHellenic Council, which operates with sororities at a national level; and the Interfraternity Council, which coordinates events amongst fraternities, will be at the event as well.

"The purpose of this event is to provide students with a perspective on what a fraternity is, what there is to do and how to join," Campos said.

Social and academic affairs will also be presented.

"We'll also discuss brotherhood, philanthropy, community service, networking and scholarships at the event," said Jose Kaloma, president of TKE. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  

According to Campos, the population growth at BBC has attracted Greek members to the campus in the recent years.

"In the last two to three years we've developed three of four more organizations. We're continuing to grow. [BBC] has become more populated," Campos said. 

This growth has given an incentive to Greek life coordinators to carry their tradition to BBC. 

UP  has a more developed fraternity life with two fraternity houses.

This includes the Phi Gamma Delta House which was the first official fraternity house on campus, five undeveloped lots and thirteen fraternities currently operating.

BBC lacks Greek housing. 

However the possibility exists.

"There is a possibility of a frat house at BBC. But we can only build what the dean allows," Campos said. "It's really not in my power to say."

Some students like junior Andres de la Pena are skeptical about fraternities.

"Fraternities are a good way to meet people but I'm not so sure I like that sort of group mentality. They're both good and bad," de la Pena said.

Campos, however, insisted on the advantages of fraternity life.

"Fraternities offer students a social life and campus involvement. We will discuss this at the event," Campos said. 

"We offer a wide range of things to students, so hopefully a lot of students will come."

Christina Fisher, a graduate student, works at the Biscayne Bay Campus Aquatics Center as an aquatics coordinator and organizes several activities, among them a summer camp for children. 

She also serves a second  shift, as a mother.

Though it would be more convenient for Fisher to work and attend classes at BBC, she needs to accommodate for her 6-year-old son.

So, she takes classes at University Park to arrange for her son's care.

"There has to be childcare here in order for it to be convenient for me as a BBC student and BBC staff. It's really not enough
that it's just down [at UP],"  Fisher said.

To accommodate faculty, staff and students like Fisher, the Student Government Council at BBC is now exploring the idea of opening childcare services on-campus.

An online survey currently posted on the Wolfe University Center's homepage seeks to find out if there is a strong demand for on campus child care.

As of Jan. 16, 76 percent  of the respondents were undergraduate students and the remaining 24 percent were graduate students, faculty and staff.

According to BBC-SGC President Camilo Silva, the survey is the first step in trying to fi gure out if the BBC community is in need of childcare services.

"Right now, we are at the first stage or 'phase one' of the project which consists in the 'finding of the numbers,' to investigate the demand and need of the service," Silva said.

Zach Trautenberg, SGA Comptroller and finance chair, said SGA has discussed various models, from a day care to a school,
like that of the Children's Creative Learning Center at UP. 

Organized by Nancy Ponn, director of the center 31 years ago, the pre-school at UP has experienced success because it has the support of the FIU community.

"If in the future it turns out that we need something like [a school], then we should have it. For now I don't think that's how it [the daycare] will be," Silva said.

So far, the results of the survey show that a program that functions more like a day care than a school seems to be the most fitting for BBC.

Since SGC-BBC's preliminary research, financial issues have not been fully discussed, though according to Trautenberg, they
don't have enough to cover everything based on their current budget.

Parents also might have to pay a fee, according to Silva.

Frances Spiegel, associate director of academic support services, says more than half of the respondents to the survey say that if childcare services were available at BBC, they would be able to take more classes.

This is in vast contrast to six years ago when the old child care center closed in 1999 due to lack of demand and financial loss.

The old day care center had a capacity of 30 children but never had more than six to eight children, according to Ponn.

Having child care services would be ideal for parents that work and attend classes like junior Sheila Auguste.

Her 2-year-old son stays with relatives while she goes to school, but she wants a better alternative.

"I would rather him go to day care to interact with other kids," Auguste said.

Cost is a factor as well, according to Aguste, and paying for off-campus day care is not appealing.

"I would pay for something on campus, but not too expensive because daycare nowadays is $80 a week or more," she added.

Evonne Palomino, a Biology major, takes most of her classes this semester at UP.

However, during last summer's classes at BBC she would bring her 4-yearold daughter, Seleste, with her.

"It would have been helpful before. I had to take her with me, though everyone said she was well-behaved in comparison to other kids they had seen in classes," Palomino said.

Fisher sees the issue as a need to fulfill both her roles as a student and a parent. 

Of course, one will always takes precedence.

"Once you become a parent, your child is your
priority," Fisher said.

Spiegel oversees the survey statistics and urges students to voice their opinions.

"Only with a reasonable demand will more steps be taken to establish the service," Spiegel said.

Those interested in participating in the survey can visit www.fiu.edu/~bbc or http://wuc.fi u.edu/.

The survey is only for those with children and will be online until Jan. 19.
