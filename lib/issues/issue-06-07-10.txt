Headline: Former FIU ace talks about minor league experience
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
At the end of the 2005 baseball season, former FIU pitcher David Asher was drafted in the eighth round of the Major League Baseball Draft that June by the Seattle Mariners.

That summer, the lefty was sent to Everett, Wash. To play for the Aquasox, the short-season rookie team in the Mariners' organization.

After spring training this season, Asher was moved up to the Mariners' Single A affiliate, the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, where he has recorded 18 appearances, 20 strikeouts, eight walks and 29 hits with a 4.24 ERA in 23 and one-third innings pitched.    

From May 2-13, however, Asher was called up to the Triple A affiliate, Tacoma Rainiers. In those 11 days he appeared in three games and recorded seven strikeouts, three walks and five hits with a 5.79 ERA in four and two-third innings pitched.

Despite a hectic travel and game schedule, the former Golden Panther had enough time to squeeze in a phone interview with The Beacon to talk about his recent experiences in his life as a professional baseball player.

Q: What is the biggest difference between the short-season rookie team you played for last season and the Single A team you are currently playing for?

There's really no difference. It's pretty much the same guys I played with and against last year. You have the same type of hitters and pitchers as last year. [However] the team I was in last year was a lot better - we went to the playoffs and finished runners-up - but this year, a lot of the early-round draft picks that were on last year's team were promoted higher.

Q: Describe your experience playing professional baseball for a second season. Is it better than playing college baseball?

I always thought it would be cool to wake up and going straight to the field - not worrying about class. But it's not as easy as I thought. You have to wake up early every day, sometimes be at the field five or six hours before game-time and travel to away games overnight and by bus most of the time.

I've dreamed of playing pro-ball since I was a little kid and I never imagined it would be like this, but you have to really love playing the game in order to go through this.

A buddy of mine, who was drafted by the Boston Red Sox, was traded to the [Arizona Diamondbacks organization] and eventually quit playing altogether after two years, even though he received a lot of money in the draft. He just couldn't take it anymore - living out of a suitcase and constantly on the move like most minor leaguers do.

The rough travel schedule is basically what these teams use to weed out the guys who really don't want to be here. 

I really don't mind it, but I can't wait to go home when the season's over. But when the season was about to start, I was excited to get going. But I guess that's the same with everything. When it's cold, you want it to be hot. When it's hot, you want it to be cold.

Q: As a pitcher, do you prefer facing batters who use wooden bats, like they do in professional baseball, or batters who use aluminum bats, like in college baseball?

I definitely prefer facing wooden bats. But lately I've been having bad luck, because guys I jam with pitches ended up getting cheap base hits off flares, which happens a lot more with aluminum bats. The difference between the two [types of bats] is that if I pitch to Barry Bonds with an aluminum bat and he gets a good hit off my pitch, he'll take my head off. But I guess Barry Bonds can do that with a wooden bat too.

Q: What did you learn in those 11 days you played for a Triple A team?

It was a great experience. It's my kind of place to be. Most of the guys are older, more mature.

When I was pitching, most of the guys I faced were players who were shuffled back and forth from the majors to the minors and most of those guys were just looking for one pitch to hit.

In Single A ball, I can get a guy to swing on a slider in the dirt, but these guys will lay off on that same slider until they see that you can throw it for a strike. Those hitters are not going to swing at garbage. They are more patient, but more aggressive at the same, and bigger and stronger, too.

Also, if two guys were to fight in Triple A, they'd fight once and get over it. Over here, two guys on the team got into a fight and they still don't want to try and fight every time they see each other.  

Q: What do you think you have to do mentally and as a baseball player to get back to the Triple A level?

Mentally, I'll always be the same guy on the mound. I'm not going to let anything get to me and I'm still going to go after guys.

Physically, I need to get my arm strength back up. Right now, I'm throwing 85-87 mph because I'm not getting as many innings now and my arm isn't used to that. In college, I was throwing 89-91, but I threw a lot more innings because I was a starter. Now I'm a reliever now and my arm strength isn't the same.

Q: Is there anything you don't like or would like to change about playing minor league baseball?

In the low A's, it's more like baby-sitting. The coaches think they have to scream and yell at you to get you to listen or understand. There are some guys who are 21, 22, 23 years old and don't need to be baby-sat.

They think that [because] we're at this level they can boss us around and give us curfew. You lose all your rights.

But there are some young guys here who never went to college and want to go out all night partying and drinking, so I understand why they do it.

Q: About a year ago, you said your goal was to be in the major leagues in two years. With a year gone by, do you still have that same goal?

I'm going to keep my expectations as high as I can, but as long as I keep moving up every year, I'll be satisfied.

My pitching coach, Lance Painter, was in the majors for nine years. 

He was a left-handed pitcher, like me, and was drafted at 22-years old, like me. He made it to the big leagues by age 25.

Headline: World Cup: The Aftermath
Subheadline: FIU men's soccer coach, students talk about tournament
Author: Reuben Pereira / Assitant News Director
&nbsp;
The 2006 FIFA World Cup came to a close July 9 when Italy was crowned world champions for the fourth time, beating France 5-3 in a penalty shootout in the final. After a month of exhilarating games, drama, and tears, FIU students  and staff had many opinions on the final, the highlights, best performances, and some of the worst moments of Germany 2006. 

For senior Matthew Gonsalves, an avid Italy fan ever since they lost the 1994 World Cup final to Brazil on penalties, the victory is redemption for the team's four consecutive exits after extra time or penalties. 

"Since the 1990 World Cup, Italy has lost out on penalties or extra time. Italy had always been written off as the team that collapsed when it came to penalties," Gonsalves said. "So, winning the biggest trophy in sports off something that's considered our weakness is sweet. I'm so happy right now, I could cry."

On the other end of the spectrum, senior Ritch Williams watched in disappointment as France, the team he supported through the tournament couldn't repeat their 1998 World Cup performance.

"I'm disappointed that France lost," Williams conceded. "I thought [France's Zinedine] Zidane was going to close out his career on top but it wasn't to be. They could have won the game but Italy hung on and won it."

Zidane, considered by many to be the greatest player of his generation, had announced that this World Cup would be his last tournament before retiring. His dream to finish out on top did not go his way as he was sent off after head butting an Italian player in the final. The act cost him the Golden Ball (Player of the Tournament) award and, more importantly, France the title.

"He would have won the Golden Ball, if it weren't for that ridiculous head butt," said senior Shaun Chugani. "It's sad that he had to end his career like that but that's how it is." 

FIU Men's soccer coach Karl Kremser, was also disappointed with Zidane's antics in the final.

"He was ready to go out as one of the all-time greats," Kremser said. "It was very disappointing. He had played wonderfully throughout the tournament, especially against Brazil, and had steered the French team to the final."

To Kremser, the World Cup as a whole including the final, was a disappointment. He considered the Italian victory unjust, because of their tendency to defend rather than score.

"France was the better team throughout the game," Kremser said. "The Italians only won because David Trezeguet's shot hit the post. The Italian goalkeeper misjudged every penalty strike." 

Kremser added that the 2006 World Cup was marred by the prominence of defensive play rather than attacking soccer and it was fitting that the Italians won.

"FIFA needs to cut down on the frequency of carding players," Kremser said. "They need to increase the flow of the game and emphasize attacking football instead of defensive and counter attacking."

Germany 2006 was the lowest scoring World Cup since Italy 1990. It also broke the record for the most yellow and red cards given out in a tournament.

Williams believed that poor refereeing decisions led to the unusually high number of cards in the tournament. 

"The first round had some pretty bad calls," Williams said. "One referee gave a player three yellow cards. It was hilariously bad. Although the refereeing did get better towards the later stages of the tournament, this World Cup will still be remembered for the notoriously bad calls." 

Gonsalves on the other hand, thought the controversies over refereeing were blown out of proportion.

"A lot of players were diving and the refs are only human and I can understand the pressure they were under in a tournament like this," Gonsalves said.

When it came down to individual skills and performances, Kremser had high praise for the German team, who he considered the tournament's most entertaining team. 

The Germans led the tournament with 14 goals scored and finished in third place.

"The German team played fantastically. They played like a real team. Jurgen Klinsmann should be credited for changing the philosophy of German play."

Klinsmann was hired as the German coach after the 2004 European Championships and has been credited for changing the style of German play from a more defensive to attacking play. 

"[Klinsmann] was patient. He related with players and he instilled the do or die attitude in the players. They brought the entire nation together," Kremser said.

Chugani, on the other hand, praised the Portuguese team, who he thought defied a lot of expectations by beating Holland and England en route to the semifinals.

"They were by far, the most entertaining team of the tournament. From Maniche to Cristiano Ronaldo, as well as the number of fouls and cards they received. They were just exciting to watch because you never knew what they would do," Chugani said.

Gonsalves added that despite the controversies and the lack of goals, Germany 2006 was another fantastic world cup that delivered all the thrills one would expect from a competition like this.

"The World Cup is the World Cup," Gonsalves said. "It's always fun to watch, regardless of the result. The only sad thing is I have to wait for four years until the next World Cup in South Africa."

Subheadline: Shuttle company switch in question
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The shuttle bus is once again in the news. As the new semester looms over the horizon, and as FIU prepares to get back into full gear, there is a troubling question that remains, as of yet, unanswered. 

The problem of who will be charged with the task of bussing students to University Park from Biscayne Bay Campus and vice-versa has yet to be resolved. For years, this was the task of 7871 Buslines Inc. For whatever reason, however, this is no longer the case. If you ask FIU officials, they will tell you that 7871 Buslines suddenly and unexpectedly simply did not show up to work one morning.

According to one such official, Bill Foster, director of Parking and Traffic, "7871 quit on FIU on a Thursday and the shuttle service was needed on a Monday."    

It seems rather difficult to believe that a company - a company with which the University has been working with for years - just one day decides to quit. 

7871 Buslines, Inc. Managing Director John Thulin disputed Foster's statement calling it, "not correct."

We have a hard time believing that Thulin would provide false information given that he said his company continues to work with several FIU departments. Furthermore, there are conflicting reports about the terms of the termination of the contract. 

Besides leaving some disturbing questions unrequited, the University chose a company that, after several weeks of service, has left many students unsatisfied. The busses that Royal Limousines uses to transport students are significantly smaller and not as comfortable as the coaches most are used to from when 7871 Buslines, Inc. was in charge. 

With the smaller vehicles, one would presume that the cost to the University - as well as the cost to the student - to actually provide the service would be significantly less. However, as of July 1, the shuttle bus fee has actually increased $1 for a round-trip fare. The Beacon initially reported on this increase earlier this year and argued against the necessity of such an increase. 

Foster confirmed that using Royal Limousines costs the University less money. It is interesting to note that the increase in the shuttle bus fee went ahead even though the University is now using a less expensive bus company to provide the shuttle service.

We hope that the University will make haste in resolving this issue and tie up any loose ends that may burden students come this Fall semester.

Headline: Unintentionally transmitting HIV could have legal penalties
Author: Jose Carlos De Witt / Assistant Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Are you HIV positive? When was the last time you got tested, for example? Because if you are sleeping around regularly, but not getting tested just as regularly, you can't say that you really know for sure.

You have probably been made aware of this time and again through so many sex education pamphlets, videos and campaigns; and you know that you should be acutely aware of your HIV status, both for the sake of your own health and your partner's. Besides, if you were to transmit the HIV virus to your sexual partner, knowingly or not, in a state like California, you could be held legally responsible for the damage.

What? Yeah, I didn't think so either, but the California Supreme Court certainly does. In a 4-3 ruling on July 3, it established that those with "constructive knowledge" that they may be infected can be held legally liable for their eventual transmission of the HIV virus. That doesn't sound so bad, does it?

There have been horror stories in the news about certain misguided individuals who, angry at fate and the world in general from having having tested positive for HIV, would go around trying to infect as many individuals as possible, seeking revenge for the bad card they had just been dealt.

Not as extreme, but equally reprehensible, are those cases in which selfish HIV-positive individuals, unwilling to take responsibility for their illness, refuse to curb their sexual activity and continue exposing others to the virus. In cases such as these, the victims should be remunerated and the perpetrators should be prosecuted.

This is not at all what the California Supreme Court is trying to do. The justices who voted in favor of this ruling went much further.

The catch lies in the term "constructive knowledge." This does not mean that you know for certain that you are infected - from a test, for example - but rather that you know, gathering from your sexual history, that you could very well be infected. 

The case, labeled John B v. Bridget B. for the privacy of the litigants, involved a married couple who somehow acquired HIV. Both parties had tested HIV-negative in the past; neither had concrete knowledge that they could be infected. It was not until she tested positive that the wife found out that her husband had engaged in sex with other men before - and possibly during - their marriage. 

John argues that the blood tests he took about a year prior to the couple's diagnosis indicated that he was clean, and that it is well possible that it was in fact Bridget who gave him the virus.

According to the judges behind this ruling, the fact that John was promiscuous, and especially the fact that it was with men rather than women, should have been sufficient for John to assume he was a likely AIDS candidate. Accordingly, John is now responsible for giving his wife the HIV virus.

The problem is that constructive knowledge is painfully difficult to determine in a field like sexual activity. Promiscuity is an unacceptably indeterminate measure to serve as the basis for a legal ruling. How much do you need to sleep around in order for a judge to determine that you "ought to have guessed" you could have HIV? That would depend on how morally conservative a particular judge is. 

Surely there is a higher incidence of HIV infection among the gay population and therefore, gay males are at higher risk than others of acquiring the virus. Does it necessarily follow, however, that the burden of proof should lie on the husband who experimented with other men, rather than on the wife? 

What if the wife was more promiscuous than he was? What if he protected himself, while she did not? In a legal setting, who is to determine these factors and apply them toward a fair adjudication? 

All of these questions need to be addressed before rulings such as this become the norm throughout the country's courtrooms.

Finally, though it is true that that this recent ruling applies only to California, a state which has been long devastated by AIDS, it does not take much imagination to realize that it could just as easily take place in South Florida. 

After all, Florida is home to 11% of America's AIDS victims, 76% of which are men, and the fastest growing HIV-positive population in the country. With such a high incidence of of HIV/AIDS and such a large gay population, this ruling could very easily be replicated in our own neighborhood.

FIU:
New York Times to train students on campus

The New York Times Journalism Institute selected FIU's School of Journalism and Mass Communication as a new training center site.

The program, which will run Jan. 3 - 10 with 20 students, will provide latino student journalists a one-week long journalism immersion program.

To qualify, students must be members of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, have completed one semester at a student newspaper or major newspaper, be in good academic standing and write a 500-word essay about being a journalist.

Homestead Mayor wants FIU campus

Homestead Mayor Roscoe Warren's wish list for the city includes creating an east-west trolley line, offering wireless Internet access downtown and scoring an FIU campus.

City spokeswoman Lillian Delgado said administrators had discussions with the University last year about adding a campus to town and that there was interest. But that a follow-up is long over due partly because of the University's new medical school and provost announcements.

Warren says he hopes ideas like these will encourage residents to become interested in the community.

Miss Tuskegee University fights for crown

An Ohio woman was crowned Miss Tuskegee University in April but had the honor taken away two months later by the university over an error in judging.

In an attempt to retain the crown and a scholarship that goes with it, Emilia Sykes, a senior this Fall semester, sued the university in federal court in Montgomery.

During contest judging, a timekeeper ruled that McCampbell's speech went over the allotted three minutes. She was subsequently penalized and came in second place.

An investigation indicated that McCampbell's speech was indeed shorter than three minutes and she shouldn't have received the penalty that cost her the crown, according to student activities director Minnie Austin.

The suit was filed last week and names Tuskegee President Benjamin Payton and two school officials involved in awarding the crown to Calida Joy McCampbell.

McCampbell appealed the ruling and won.

U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson set a hearing on Sykes' suit for July 31.

North Korea fires several test missiles

After receiving threats from the United States and Japan, North Korea test-fired several long-range missile that may be capable of reaching the Western Hemisphere, officials said. The missile failed seconds after launch.

North Korea also tested five shorter-range missiles in an exercise the White House does not consider an immediate threat.

Both Japan and South Korea protested. Japan called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting. South Korea said the tests would further promote North Korea's world-wide isolation.

Headline: BBC forum sparks debate for current cafeteria space
Author: Nelcy Charlot / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In hopes of addressing student concerns and questions about the upcoming year at Biscayne Bay Campus, the Student Government Association hosted an open forum in the Wolfe University Center  where students were able to get answers. 

With the new cafeteria set to open next May at the south end of WUC and the old cafeteria space on the second floor of the WUC available, students questioned what the university would do with the space. 

The forum was organized to get students' input about what to do with the soon to be available cafeteria space. 

Greg Olson, senior director of student affairs and WUC, lead the forum's discussion and answered most questions. SGA wants to use the space as a student lounge and game room area to get more students involved on campus.  

"We need the right vendors and services to appeal to the students to actually utilize the WUC," said Kenesha Paul, Campus Life chair. 

Also addressed was the issue of creating more office space for SGA. For some time now, SGA and Campus Life have been sharing office space and both organizations agree it has become a problem.

 "We will do research to find out what is most demanding for the students or where there is a great need before we make any decision on what to do with the space if offered to us," said Brent Maximin, director of student lobbying.

Increasing class availability at BBC was also discussed as a possibly option. 

SGA suggested that if more classes were offered, it would reduce the burden of commuting between campuses. 

This was a concern for students because the round-trip shuttle ticket prices increased by $1 this month. 

"We are trying to accommodate the students," Olson said.

But Paul suggested that adding more classes in the open space might interfere with the on campus activities going on in Panther Square. 

"A sea-saw affect will contradict the events that are taking place because of the fact that we will have to schedule the events according to the class schedules, which will leave some days emptier than most," Paul said.

A toss up between adding more classes or more activities came about.

"Adding more activities would be better," said freshman Essence Thompson, who lives on campus. "At times, it gets boring around here."

Some SGA members felt that perhaps circulating a petition would be necessary to find out what students who weren't able to make it to the forum have to say. 

The association also discussed moving the Wellness Center to the WUC, so that it can be located where students can easily get to it.  

No decision was made at the forum, but Olson guaranteed that the students' opinions would be taken into account.

Headline: Indian association blends cultures
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Assistant Life! Editor
&nbsp;
For students interested in meeting a diverse group of people and learning about Indian heritage, the Indian Students Association offers many opportunities for networking and cultural celebration. 

"The purpose of ISA is to provide FIU students with a method to promote and celebrate the Indian culture, while at the same time giving back to the community and having a great time doing it," said ISA President Jacob Mathai. 

Throughout the year, the organization hosts events ranging from movie nights to basketball tournaments. However, ISA was no match against last year's natural forces. 

"We came into last year with a really great year planned out, but unfortunately, the hurricanes proved to be a big setback, and our Fall semester was a bit slow getting started," Mathai said. "This year, we're going to be better prepared for unforeseen circumstances."

Although events such as movie nights are a staple for many clubs, ISA hikes up these activities by adding a cultural aspect to them. 

Bollywood Movie Night is a monthly movie showing where members watch films made in India; the term "Bollywood" refers to the Indian film industry.

"The movie night is a chance for people with different cultures to get a taste of Indian culture," said senior Reshma George. "It's convenient for students because the movies are shown on campus."

In addition to showing foreign movies, ISA at FIU competes against other Indian students associations in an annual football game known as the Desi Bowl. 

Picnics and karaoke nights are other activities that the club hosts for members. The most anticipated event is the Diwali Show, which takes place during the Fall semester. 

Last Fall, more than 400 students attended the show, making it the organization's most successful event. 

"A lot of people always attend the Diwali Show, which involves fashions shows, skits, and dancing," said ISA Historian Sean Loret De Mola. "It's a nice celebration that's akin to an Indian Christmas, and it's the high point of the semester."

Aside from bringing back events from last year, the club's executive board is also developing ideas for the future. 

"One idea that we have is a cricket tournament," said Loret De Mola. "It's still on the drawing board, but it could work out. There have also been talks about having a monthly club night, where we rent out a section of a nightclub, and members can go party."

Because membership is not limited to Indian students, anyone can join ISA and participate in its events.

"We open our membership to everybody because we want to raise awareness of Indian culture,"  said Loret De Mola, the sole Cuban in the club. "We're all about promoting social relationships and providing students with somewhere to go for support." 

With more than 75 active members, the club has a solid foundation of involved students who want to enhance the organization. ISA even has supporters outside of the university. 

"We have a lot of support from former students as well as students from other universities," said Mathai.

To increase the club's visibility on campus, ISA members have been promoting at freshman orientations and giving away free T-shirts to interested students during the summer. 

Mathai admits that there are some problems that make promoting the club difficult, but he is hopeful that the new school year will be successful. 

"It's hard to get people involved at a predominantly commuter university, so I think we have [to] catch people's interest and show people that it's actually worth traveling here for events," said Mathai. "Once fall starts, expect us to be everywhere - we're taking over FIU."

Headline: University switches shuttle service, increases fare
Author: Elischa Ramirez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When 7871 Buslines Inc. ended its contract with the University the second week of the Summer A semester, the University was in need of finding a new shuttle bus company. The reason for the switch: 7871 Buslines Inc. wanted more money due to rising fuel costs, according to Ed Vazquez, associate director of Purchasing Services.

The switch may also be the driving force behind the University's shuttle ticket price increase. The shuttle fee increased July 1 from $1.50 to $2 for a one-way trip - a 33 percent increase.

FIU offers its Golden Panther Express shuttle service for students and faculty commuting between University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus. 

"7871 quit on FIU on a Thursday and the shuttle service was needed on a Monday," said Bill Foster, director of Parking and Traffic. "The new company is an emergency and temporary service that was requested by the University." 

However, 7871 Buslines Inc.'s managing director, John Thulin, did not agree with Foster. 

In a letter to The Beacon, Thulin wrote that "what Bill Foster said is not correct."

"Due to the fact that we continue to work with various FIU departments, we are not ready to go into politics and or comments at this time," Thulin said.

He declined further comments on the issue.

The unexpected change has left some students on edge.

Junior Melissa Quincosa, a frequent shuttle rider, didn't think much of the change at first, but now is dissatisfied with Royal Limousine's punctuality and safety. 

 "After being on [Royal Limousine's buses], the drivers were reckless, and they were never on time," she said. "They would always leave earlier and the buses were over crowded." 

Senior Stephanie Tosco agreed with Quincosa and described her experience with Royal Limousines' as totally unpleasant. 

"During Summer A, Royal Limousines' buses have broken down three times," Tosco said. "The drivers are unsafe and drive very fast, and at first they were lost and did not know the way to and from the campuses."

Tosco also said that 7871 Buslines Inc. rarely had problems and was more reliable. 

"FIU will soon be sending out a request for a new company and will be accepting any company that offers a good, reasonably priced, and dependable service," Foster said. 

The increase in fees is due to a re-allocation of cost, according to the Parking and Traffic department. 

Originally, the money for the shuttle service was obtained through the Educational and General fund, a branch of the State University System, which operates university budgets. However, shuttle funds will now source from an increase in parking and access fees paid by students and an increase in shuttle ticket prices,  according to Bill Foster. 

Foster stated that Royal Limousines was a logical choice for FIU because the buses, which are much smaller, use less gas and cost the University less money.  

Royal Limousines bus driver Angel Bernard believes that the gas prices might also have something to do with the fee increase. 

He also said the estimated diesel cost for a days commute to and from campus is $200 per shuttle bus and the cost for tolls is an estimated $13.50 per day per shuttle bus. These are only a portion of the fees, and may not reflect the fees that FIU pays for the shuttle service.

Vasquez estimates that one day's worth of the service during the Summer semester can amount to $180 per hour for the University. 

Students such as Quincosa and Tosco have mixed feelings about the price increases.

Quincosa said that she was willing to pay the extra $1 fee for the round-trip service as long as it was guaranteed to be safe. Tosco on the other hand stated that the fee increases were unfair and abrupt. 

The University is currently searching for another bus company.

"FIU has no contract with Royal Limousines. Their agreement is only based on the prices that had been paid to 7871 … We are looking for a new 7871 motor-coach company that will not quit on us, and will complete their contract," Foster said.  

As for company changes, Bernard was not aware of the companies' service being temporary, but did say that the company was trying to improve its bus conditions to ensure a higher quality service. 

"Our buses will be fixed accordingly to better serve students ... we are a very reliable company, that not only serves FIU," Bernard said.

Headline: Pirates sequel strikes gold
Author: Reuben Pereira / Assistant News Director
&nbsp;
What was it about Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl that made it such a phenomenon with audiences and critics in 2003? Was it the super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer? Was it the audiences' craving for something fresh and entertaining amid the countless recycled sequels and prequels? Or was it Johnny Depp's magnificent turn as the insane and comedic, yet heroic Capt. Jack Sparrow? I would be inclined to go with the latter, but in all fairness, it was a bit of everything. The movie stormed the box-office, wowed critics, and earned five Oscar nominations including Best Actor for Depp's performance. 

Flash forward three years to the first of two Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, Dead Man's Chest, which opened July 7. The audience's anticipation is perhaps at an all-time high, and the summer is in sore need of an audience pleasing, action packed film. 

So does Dead Man's Chest deliver? A resounding "yes" is unfitting to describe how lively and entertaining this film is. Dead Man's Chest provides more thrills, laughs, mangy pirates, exotic locations, swashbuckling action and yes, more of Jack Sparrow. 

To say that the plot is more complex than the first film is a gross understatement. Apparently, Jack Sparrow sold his soul to the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the ghost pirate of the underworld, and now Sparrow's time is up. Jack must try to find a way out of his debt or else he'll be doomed to a life of eternal damnation and service to the squid-faced Jones's ghost ship, the Flying Dutchman. Making his life worse are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), who find themselves needing Sparrow in order to get out of a prison sentence. 

Joining in on the fun are many of the principal characters from the first film including Norrington (Jack Davenport), whose life has taken a terrible turn since the events of the first film; Jack's first mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally), who remains superstitious; and the hilarious comic pirate duo Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook), who provide most of the film's comedic moments when Jack Sparrow isn't around.

Dead Man's Chest's action sequences are enough to outdo anything from the first film. 

The best of them is one of the best choreographed fight sequences ever put on film. The stunning sequence begins with a beach fight between Depp, Bloom and Davenport. Ending 20 minutes later, the trio will have fought at a church in ruins, on a rolling giant wheel and with slimy underworld creatures - all while trying to grab the key to the titular Dead Man's Chest. It's simply exhilarating: The film feels like a mishmash between the Indiana Jones films and the Errol Flynn swashbucklers of the '40s.

As expected, Depp is perfect as Sparrow. He may not be as comic and goofy as in the first film, but he's still more interesting and refreshing the second time around than half of Hollywood's heroes.  

The role of Turner fits Bloom like a glove, and he wears it well. His character has more of a plum role in this film, especially regarding the relationship with his father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellen Skarsgard). 

Knightley's role is also enhanced, showing Swann turning more and more into a pirate and a woman who'll do anything to get her way. 

Gore Verbinski, who also directed the first film, continues to be one of the brightest young directors in the business bringing freshness and added thrills to a blooming franchise and not allowing it to become a stale sequel. 

The only problem that plagues Dead Man's Chest was a problem that plagued the first film - its running time. At two hours and 35 minutes, it's a little too long, but with the constant thrills, exotic locales and high sea adventures with swashbuckling pirates on screen, the time flies by. 

The film closes with a cliff-hanger that will leave audiences cheering at the appearance of a certain Oscar- winning actor and make the wait for Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End next summer a much longer one.

End Note: Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is everything a summer blockbuster and sequel should be. It is the best time you'll have this summer and most likely, over the course of the year as well.

Headline: Vietnamese restaurant delightful, a must try
Author: Lalinda De la Fuente / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Although Chinese and Japanese cuisine seem to lurk around every corner in Miami with Thai food becoming just as numerous, other more unique and exotic Asian fare can sometimes be hard to find.  That's where the small, quiet yet scrumptious Vietnamese restaurant Miss Saigon Bistro comes into the picture.

With locations in Coral Gables, Brickell and Pinecrest, Miss Saigon Bistro offers patrons a taste of fine Vietnamese cooking for lunch and dinner.  Their Coral Gables location, being the most popular, is a quaint bistro nestled among a row of other culinary locations on Giralda Avenue. 

Although small, this location never has a shortage of customers whereas on weekends the line can continue straight out the door. Weekdays, except Fridays, are generally a better time to experiment with Miss Saigon.  

Reservations are available on these days as well. On Fridays and weekends, Miss Saigon drops their reservation policy to accommodate their stream of patrons throughout the night.  If weekend outings are more for you, Miss Saigon is still worth the wait.

The cornerstone of the restaurant is its variety of delicious appetizers.  A patron with a small appetite can easily order an array of these bite-sized concoctions and call it a meal. A must try here are their summer, winter or fall rolls.  

These small rolls contain an assortment of vegetables, including bean sprouts, carrots and mint leaves, coupled with shrimp, pork or both all swathed in a light noodle wrapping.  When dipped in their signature plum sauce, these rolls become as delicious as they are healthful.  

Seafood lovers can try their green mussels, which are served hot swimming in a bowl of a dark garlic-based sauce. Never under - or over - cooked, these mussels remain a favorite at Miss Saigon.

Entrees at Miss Saigon vary from rice dishes to noodle dishes and include every meat from chicken to fish. Vegetarian specials are also offered, making Miss Saigon a restaurant friendly for all palettes.  

The real delights are their noodle soups.  The noodle soup is not only a staple on the Miss Saigon menu but also one in the Vietnamese diet. These soups are served up in a hot, clear broth with an overabundance of rice noodles.  Vegetables, which are brought to your table separately, can be added according to your own taste. Bean sprouts, mint leaves and field greens are among the vegetable selection.  

Your soup can have a variety of meats, anything from chicken to beef to seafood.  My personal favorite is the beef meatball noodle soup.  

These beef meatballs are made Vietnamese style and deter from the western one that uses ground meat.  This dish offers you a tasty and lighter meatball option served up in a simple yet delicious noodle soup.

Although the noodle soups are their more affordable options at around $10 per bowl, their seafood choices are their more delectable ones. Be prepared to share these fish dishes, which generally offer a whole cooked fish. 

Their lemongrass crispy fish is fried to perfection coupled with the unmistakable and aromatic essence of lemongrass, a very Asian addition to any meal.  

 Their steamed fish, a more healthful choice then the fried one, is just as delicious. Always offered with cooked vegetables in a light yet flavorful sauce, their steamed fish is a must try on the menu.

A great way to end your meal is with their luscious coconut ice cream.  Unlike imposter coconut ice creams that are made with real milk, this homemade dessert is made instead with coconut milk, giving it a rich, smooth and scrumptious taste. The Miss Saigon's experience is complete with impeccable service.  

The staff is always friendly and always on their toes to serve you in any way necessary. The staff is so cordial that once you become a frequent customer, they are bound to remember your face.

Headline: Fresh Meat
Subheadline: Student participates in MTV's "Real World/Road Rules Challenge"
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Linette Gallo has been a reality TV junkie since she first watched FOX's Temptation Island in 2001. So when the 21-year-old junior ended up on MTV's "Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Fresh Meat," she struggled to believe it.

"Being on stage and seeing [past cast members] was so crazy; it was very surreal," Gallo said. "I watch these challenges all the time and think, 'that would be the coolest thing in the world, but could I really do that?'"

Gallo, a Miami native of Spanish ancestry, was so in love with reality TV that she auditioned to appear on "The Real World: Key West," but casting agents for the show told her that she didn't make the final cut. 

After accepting an offer to appear on Fresh Meat instead, she was on a plane to Australia days later and ready to compete against the people she followed on TV.

But Gallo's arrival in the Land of Oz quickly taught her that reality TV isn't exactly realistic.

"[Producers] edit scenes to make you seem however they want to," she said. "People ask me how Coral was because she seems like a big bully on TV, but she's the biggest sweetheart. You don't always see their real personalities on the show."

Viewers have not seen much of Gallo's persona yet, but her random demeanor will surface in upcoming episodes. 

Gallo's animated personality first appeared during her childhood. A self-admitted dork who always drew attention, family members nicknamed the hyperactive child "Pistola." She proudly maintains that kooky nature, which proved to be an asset once "Fresh Meat" cast-mates started gunning for each other.

"People mistake me for an airhead, but I'm smart," Gallo said. "That was an advantage because they thought Shane and I would be the worst team, but it's better for people to underestimate you."

Challenges took place only four days per week, so cast members had plenty of free time to play pranks, lounge by the pool, and even create a home-made Slip 'N Slide. A few cast-mates, including Gallo and Theo Von from "Road Rules: Maximum Velocity Tour," even decided to partake in the traditional reality TV romance.

But the light atmosphere of the competition became progressively grim as cliques and alliances were formed to avoid elimination. 

Gallo still managed to forge lasting friendships despite the behind-the-scenes scheming, but she never got along with one notoriously disliked cast-mate.

"Tonya is exactly as they portray her on TV - a thief," Gallo said. "I never liked her because she stole my sandals and my camera. If she says that she likes your shirt, and it's not there the next day, don't be surprised." 

Since returning from filming "Fresh Meat," Gallo has followed a familiar path set by reality-TV alumni and sought to launch a career in modeling. 

"Once I got back, I thought, 'Why not take advantage and see how far I could get,'" she said. "Aviv and I are talking to a couple of agents to try to do appearances and promote ourselves as much as possible for TV or modeling gigs."

Gallo will continue studying advertising at FIU until her career takes off. She even considers pursuing that field instead of her long-standing dream of being a teacher as the most challenging thing that she's faced. Well, except for her time on "Fresh Meat," of course.

"The whole point of the show is to make you realize that you can do things that you never thought you could do," Gallo said. "I hope that they ask me back for another challenge. It was the greatest experience of my life."

"Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Fresh Meat" airs Mondays at 10 p.m.
