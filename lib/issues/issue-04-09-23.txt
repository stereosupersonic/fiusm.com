Headline: Basketball to face UConn, Miami among tough schedule
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The basketball schedule was released this past week and it is a challenging one for Coach Sergio Rouco and his team.

The Golden Panthers will kick off the season on Nov. 19 against Florida Atlantic at the Pharmed Arena. Rouco is looking forward to building a rivalry with the Boca Raton team.

"We are building a rivalry with FAU who once they get in our conference, it will be bigger," said Rouco, who enters his first year as head coach of the Golden Panthers.

The biggest challenge for FIU will be a non-conference game against defending National Champions University of Connecticut Huskies on Nov. 30. Rouco hopes this opportunity will help improve the quality of his players. 

"We'll see where we are at. The kids grow up watching UConn on TV and this game will put them against the best and we will see where the program is at," Rouco said.

The Huskies game will take place before kicking off a stretch of games against state opponents.  The University of Miami Hurricanes will travel to Pharmed Arena on Dec. 7 marking the first time Miami plays on Golden Panther territory.

Rouco credits Athletic Director Rick Mello for getting together with University of Miami officials in order for the Hurricanes to play at Pharmed Arena and encourages fans to attend.

"Its good for faculty, staff and students to attend these games. Rick Mello has done a good job putting together for Miami to come here," Rouco said. "Miami is always a challenge for us."

FIU will also take part in the Orange Bowl Blossom weekend when the football team will face Florida A&M. The basketball team will do the same and face FAMU on Nov. 26. With such a large alumni base in Miami, it made sense for Rouco to arrange the game.

"It's good to built in state rivalries. FAMU has a big alumni base here in Miami so we needed to get that game in our schedule," said Rouco, who is also excited to play Big East opponent  University of South Florida on Dec. 20.

As the team did last year, FIU will host a holiday tournament during Dec. 27-28. Teams playing include Ohio Univeristy, Binghamton and first round NCAA opponent Colgate.

The first Sun Belt Conference game will take place Jan. 15 against Denver.

Rouco doesn't mind playing a schedule full of challenging games.

"We want to create an identity for the FIU basketball program. We want to play the top teams in this state, and beyond, because we want to be able to recruit those types of players. I just wanted the most competitive schedule we could put together so people would begin to realize that we are a Division-I school here in Miami," Rouco said.

The SBC Championship will take place on March 4-8. 

The winner of the championship is given an automatic berth to advance to the NCAA championships.

Headline: FIU rugby team ties 5-5 with powerhouse Tridents
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Miami Tridents, one of the best men's rugby teams in the state of Florida came to play the Golden Panthers this past Saturday Sept. 18 at FIU North  Field at Univesity Park campus.

The Tridents are so good in fact, that in the past two years they have lost a grand total of only three games. 

Each player on that team has an average of ten years experience playing rugby. 

In FIU's previous meeting with them, the Tridents had their way in a 56-7 rout. In a battle of experience versus heart and determination FIU held the  Tridents to a 5-5 tie. 

FIU, which was clearly underestimated, began attacking from the start, leading to a try (equivalent to a touchdown in football and worth five points)  in the first five minutes of the game.

The conve

rsion kick (equal to a point after touchdown in football and worth two points), was missed leaving FIU with a five-point lead that they held for about 25 minutes. 

The Tridents took advantage and scored a try off a crucial mistake by an FIU back lineman who dropped a back pass and failed to touch down the ball in the in-goal area, which would have resulted in a touchback.

The Tridents, nevertheless, were unsuccessful on the conversion kick as well.

The second half was a defensive battle as both teams, especially the Tridents, squandered their chances to take the lead. 

The Tridents' frustrations finally erupted during a stoppage of play while the ball was being setup. One of their players tackled an unsuspecting FIU player. 

When the player was moved away, another Trident player came and threw a sucker punch at another FIU player.

 Not less than ten minutes later, on the opposite side of the field, the same player who  had thrown the sucker punch earlier, threw another punch to the FIU fullback in the middle of a tackle. 

The referee finally had enough and sent both players into the sin bin (the equivalent of a penalty box in hockey). 

Then, as final seconds of the game wound down, the Tridents attempted a desperate drop goal kick (the equivalent of a field goal) worth three points - to no avail; the game ended in a draw.  

 After the game, Captain Leo Leon said that the game may have ended in a draw but it was a moral victory for FIU.

Leon, who plays scrumhalf (equivalent to a quarterback) has been with the team since last year. 

"I am very proud of the team, and I have seen a vast improvement this year," said Leon. 

Senior Sean Alcindor credits that vast improvement to the team's workout regimen.

"We've been working out, doing weight training and cardio. By the end of the game some of their guys were cramping up and couldn't keep up with us," said Alcinidor.

"We still have a lot of work to do, too many mistakes," said John Bankston, who received All-American Honorable Mention last year.

Bankston, who played football prior to joining the rugby team, urges anyone who used to play sports to come to a practice.

"You'll either love it or you'll hate it but at least you gave it a try," Bankston said.

The team is always accepting new members. They also hope to start a women's team in the future. The team currently has one female player on the roster.

"This is a team that is open to everyone in the school, all levels of experience. Just bring a white T-shirt, some cleats, and a will to work," said Coach Gerardo Ferraris.

For those interested in joining the rugby team you can check them out on the web at www.fiu.edu/~rugby or you can call the hotline at (305) 679-9958.

Headline: Men's soccer earns a split in USF Invitational
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU men's soccer team overcame a late deficit to defeat Alabama A&M 4-3 with a stellar performance from Junior Jared Rose. Rose, who recorded his first multi-goal game of the season, finishing Saturday's game with two goals and five total points. 

The No. 22 ranked Golden Panthers came into the USF--Holiday Inn Invitational at USF Soccer Stadium in Tampa in hopes of picking up their second victory of the season after starting 1-1. 

They did just that after their first game of the tournament as the team improved to 2-1-0 while dropping the Bulldogs to 2-3-0.

The win was important for the Golden Panthers because it was the first of two games to be played back to back. Due to Hurricane Ivan, the game had to be pushed forward from Friday Sept.17 to Saturday Sept. 18.

"Each game is important. This one was a bit of a struggle. Because of the hurricane in Alabama, the game was put back from Friday to Saturday, so we played two games back to back when other teams played Friday and then Sunday," said Kremser.

The Golden Panthers came into the game with Atlantic Soccer Conference Player of the Week, Rose, who certainly played a major role in FIU's come-from-behind victory. 

Rose started things off in the 18th minute when he assisted the speedster Carron Williams for the first goal of the game. He then recorded his second goal of the season on a free kick in the 52nd minute of the match that gave the Golden Panthers a 2-1 lead.  

Later in the game after Eugene Sepuya scored to put Alabama A&M ahead 3-2, Rose connected on a penalty kick knotting the score at 3-3. 

From there, FIU went on to take the lead and the win with a 78th minute goal by Fernando Plentz who was nicely set up with a cross pass from Williams. 

Kremser likes the job Rose who scored twice in the game, has done for the team this season.

"He's done well, he did some nice free kicks. Jared's done well this year for us," Kremser said.

FIU out shot the Bulldogs 21-15 while sophomore goalkeeper Shawn Crowe recorded two saves in 90 minutes.

September 19: SMU 1, FIU 0

One day after the Golden Panthers won a shootout against Alabama A&M scoring four goals on twenty-one shots, No. 5 Southern Methodist University blanked FIU. 

In a low scoring affair between the two teams, Michael Uremovich came off the bench for the Mustangs and recorded the game-winning goal during the 44th minute of the match. 

Despite the Golden Panthers No.21 ranked scoring offense, averaging 2.50 goals per game, its offensive attack was put to rest Sunday afternoon. Southern Methodist picked up their eighth straight victory over the Golden Panthers. FIU fell to 2-2 for the season.

Coach Kremser saw chances in the second half to score, but the team was unable to connect.

"They had an extra day to recover. We played pretty well but got pretty sloppy towards the end. In the second half towards the end, we played well and had chances to tie the game but weren't able to get the goal," Kremser said.

Kremser was optimistic that if the game had gone into overtime his team would have won. FIU lost their second straight game against a ranked opponent and fell to 2-2-0 for the season and 1-8-0 in the series against SMU. 

The Mustangs were able to bounce back after getting blanked by host USF 3-0 in the tourney's opener. Although the Golden Panthers had several opportunities to get in the game, they were both outshot (16-10) and had a 5-9 disadvantage in corner kicks.

FIU's Jean Camere, a junior transfer from St.John's, started his third straight game and led the Golden Panthers with four shots on goal. 

Sophomore goalkeeper Shawn Crowe recorded six saves in the match while Steve Sandbo had two stops for SMU.

In the tournament's title game, host University of South Florida defeated Alabama A&M 1-0.

At press time, the Golden Panthers had yet to play cross-town rival the Univeristy of Miami.

The next home game for Coach Kremser and his team is on Sept. 24 against New Jersey Tech. After New Jersey, the team will travel to Jacksonville on Sept. 27 only to return and face South Florida at home on Oct. 3.

Headline: Freshman players depend on veterans to lead
Author: Cherysh  St. John  / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Often, the media focuses on All-Star athletes or on  "big name" players of college ball but many people forget that these players were once high school players who made that huge switch from high school to the scary world of college freshman.

Traversing campuses two, maybe three times the size of those to which they are accustomed to; confusing class schedules, classes so far away a drive is needed to bring them closer. To top it all off, you've gone from being one of the best-known people in your school to being just another freshman (or fresh meat as they are know to seniors) on a campus of thousands. 

Add to this the extra burden of football and thus is the plight of the freshman football player.

Maintaining a course load between 12 and 15 credits, which translates to about ten or 12 hours of classes each week and ten hours of study hall. 

With daily practices and cardio to stay fit, many freshman football players find that their lives exist solely of football and school. 

According to sophomore wide receiver Chandler Williams, "My freshman year was my rough year." 

Coming out of high school he had the same misconception as most college freshman that school would be easy but he discovered otherwise. 

He was on academic probation but with help from the coaches (tutoring and study hours) he was able to pull his GPA back to the required level and has been in good academic standing since. 

He credits his "Big Brother" Rashod Smith with helping him through the rougher spots in his first year at school.

Freshman player Hardy Houge, the first freshman to be recruited from out of state by FIU, maintains that though his transition into university was more difficult than usual (new state, new people, larger workload and a brand new environment in which to play football) the team and its coaches have made his transition a lot easier than if he had been on his own. 

"I hang out with the guys and that makes it easier and as far as football goes. They've helped me with my game and helped me adapt to more people and a faster pace, and that's good," said Houge.

According to wide receiver Harold Leath, he helps freshman with their gimmicks and shows them tricks to improve their game.

"There are not a lot of freshmen playing on the line, a lot of them are red shirted except for some of the defense players. It's difficult coming into any program as a freshman and some people catch on and some people don't," said Leath.  

One of the freshmen who appears to have caught onto the game very quickly is defensive lineman Sabas Whittaker III a 19-year-old player from Miami Jackson High School. 

Sabas credits his dedication to the game and his transition to college ball to his high school coach, former NFL player John Harris. According to this 285 lbs. player, he has adapted well to the game in college because of on-campus living and help from fellow D-linemen  teammates Brandon Higdon  and Pedro Farias. 

The Miami native says that when he got into college they taught him that there was no longer a distinction between bigger and smaller guys but that they were all men and everyone was the same as far as the coach was concerned.

Sabas, a self-confessed mama's boy, chose to attend FIU because they were close to home and would allow him to remain near to his mother which he believes is his duty as the last child.

Sabas is excited to take part in the growth of the FIU football program.

" [FIU] is in the growing process right now and everybody has to start somewhere, you can't just start on the top. You gotta go gradually. You can't walk before you crawl."

Sabas chose FIU over Florida State University, University of Florida, Rutgers, Auburn, Eastern Kentucky, Central Michigan, Florida A&M University, and Youngstown State. 

Apart from staying close to home, the greater opportunity of playing and quality of coaches influenced him to be a Golden Panther along with the choice of staying home. Sabas looks forward to working with head coach Don Strock and position coach Jim Taubert. 

The freshman along with the rest of the team will play Western Kentucky University on Saturday, Sept. 25.

&nbsp;
Over the past 30 years, FIU has expanded and changed drastically in order to compete with other big name schools in the state. In recent years, it has been hard to turn a corner without seeing a new construction site or hearing about a new project in the works. While this continuing struggle with the acquisition of the "bigger and better" aids FIU's growing student body, the dreams of a better tomorrow may be hindering the realities of today.	

A college can build a reputation through many forms: program offerings, aesthetic beauty, or a division I-A football team. Most importantly, though, a college should have a reputation for strength in academics. A public university was first built in Miami so students could get an education they could be proud of - and to a far lesser degree for the football team's record or the splendor of the student union. 

It is essential for a major university to develop a nationally recognized law school and a medical school over time; however, these programs cannot exist without quality English, math and science programs. These are core programs that should be solidified first.

The unveiling of seven new projects at last week's Board of Trustees meeting is exciting and auspicious for such a young school. However, building too much too soon may be spreading resources too thin, and while the millions of dollars it will take to complete these projects are costly, the quality of the students' educational experience is worth much more.

Headline: Wicked waves stokes surfer
Author: Levi Casteel / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When you live in Miami and you're a surfer, you get desperate for waves and you surf at any chance you get. 

Most people get scared when they hear a hurricane is coming our way, especially if it's the size that Hurricane Frances was.

I along with many other wave-deprived surfers in Miami get stoked. We pray that it will pass by us, of course, but still get close enough to send us some sick swells.

This was the case on Sept. 4, the day Frances rocked the coast and sent us big swells. Maybe it wasn't the waves themselves that were out of the ordinary, even though they were epic I must say. It might have been just that at this moment there were no surfers in the water! 

I couldn't believe it! It was a miracle! It was a complete shock to me! I had to talk my friend into forgetting about the cops. It was easy enough playing hide and seek with them on South Beach. There were cops everywhere patrolling the beaches, kicking everyone off. You couldn't park anywhere without cops harassing you!

Luckily for me, I had recently met a friend of a friend who just so happened to live right on the beach, with a view of the waves and cops, and covered, secure and legal parking. He looked off his balcony like a lookout for a top-secret operation while we waited for the "all clear" call. We got the call that the cops had vanished, so we sneaked out of the parking garage and ran as fast as we could to the water and jumped in. We had surfed earlier in the day before we got kicked off the beach. The waves were huge for South Beach, with 10 -12 foot faces. Crazy rip currents also made for a slightly intense situation.

Even though the sky darkened and the weather was deteriorating, the wind let up a bit around six o'clock. There were sick barrels up and down the line up, and better yet: we were out there all alone! That never happens at South Beach! It was great for the whole 10-20 minutes it lasted until one guy showed up, then another, then another, until there were about 20 guys out by the time it got dark, but this was still an amazingly low number considering the amount of good waves we got.

Then, Ivan the terrible looked early on as though it was going to come straight at us. Instead it went up through the Gulf and gave the West Coast some good swells, which I'm sure was a relief for surfers on that side of the state. It's usually flat as a lake over there for most of the year. 

On a mission to surf some good waves, my buddy and I drove to the town of Venice on the Gulf Coast, recognized as a good surfing spot because of an inlet with jetties on both sides, which create good sandbars. 

It was breaking best on the north side of the inlet this time, with waves in the overhead range. The waves weren't as good as the ones at South Beach during Frances, but they were still fun and worth the drive. 

On our way to Venice we drove through the Punta Gorda area that had been hit by Charley, and I'm sad to say that there was much visible destruction. Most of the trees were bent sideways. Many highway light posts were bent in half. Billboards weredestroyed, and many buildings and structures demolished. This was a sad realization of what hurricanes can do, especially of what the eye of a hurricane can do, since we didn't see any other damage except for in that area.    

As for the waves, Charley gave us a small day of some little somethin' somethin' waves, Frances blew and gave us four to five days of surf, and depending on who you ask, one epic day. Ivan the Terrible cruised up the Gulf and produced some good swells, and now we're looking to Jeanne to see if she's going to do anything for us. 

With hope for the surfers, it will pass by close enough to give us some waves, and then take off out into the North Atlantic or by some miracle just dissappear into thin air right before landfall. That would be cool to see! In the meantime, I'll keep on dreaming of perfect waves.

Headline: FIU sends aid to hurricane victims
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
In an effort to aid Caribbean islands devastated by Hurricane Ivan last week, different organizations within FIU have kicked up relief funds and donation drives, setting up various activities with the purpose of collecting items and money for the countless victims of the storm.

Following a path similar to that of Hurricane Frances before it, Ivan had swept over the Caribbean with category 4 winds on the week of Sept. 6, leaving in its wake devastation unseen by some of the islands since the mid-90's.

Among the worst hit nations were Jamaica, Grand Cayman and Grenada, a tiny, southern Caribbean country that lost 90 percent of its buildings and structures.

The Caribbean Student Association, an FIU club mostly made up of students with ties to the impacted area, sought ways to lend a hand as soon as news of the devastation had reached Miami.

"We found out, and we did our best to see what we could do for all those people," said Adenna Sylvester, a senior and president of the association. "We're still trying to help all those who weren't lucky enough like us to escape the hurricane."

Though following such traditional relief drive efforts like setting collection boxes in the SGA offices and dorms, the club also searched for more creative means to express their solidarity with the many hurricane victims.

On Sept. 16, the organization sponsored a special dance titled "Glow," during which guests, dressed entirely in white, paid an entrance fee to dance in the dark at Gracie's Grill. A total of 380 cans and $300 were collected during the event.

"Not only the dance, but all our efforts have been met with great support. We even had Wal-Mart donate a gift certificate of $50 to help in our collection. It's become a community thing," Sylvester said.

At the Biscayne Bay campus, the SGA has been calling on students to pledge supplies for the victims of Ivan, Frances and Charley. The collection is set in the form of a contest against other schools in which the winner will receive a visit from Governor Jeb Bush.

Susan Jay, senior director of non-credit programming in Continuing and Professional Studies, also decided to join the aid effort, organizing her own drive with the special aim of helping the island of Grenada. Her reasons are simple.

"As a result of the hurricane, the island sustained huge damage to homes, agriculture, schools, hospitals, churches, communications systems. It was a tremendous disaster, and they need all the help they can receive," she said.

Beginning on Sept. 11, Jay has been accepting tax-exempt check donations, which she transfers to the Grenada Education and Development Program, an organization that deals with the education of women, youth, and the impoverished in rural Grenadian communities.

Jay, an alumnus of Brandeis University in Massachusetts, was told of the relief effort by Dessima Williams, a sociology professor at the same university. Williams, a former Grenadian ambassador, is the head of the GRENED program and long-time friend of Jay's.

Optimistic about student involvement in the project, Jay hopes the fund will give a feeling of goodwill to all those involved.

"Where I come from, charity and good works are the most important things you can do. It isn't just necessarily about what you're getting paid to do, what you're studying for," she said.

Donations will be accepted until the Thanksgiving holiday in November.

Other organizations holding relief drives or special collection funds include the KDP Honor Society, the Volunteer Action Center and other efforts begun by individual faculty and students.

Headline: Solar house hits milestone
Author: Harry Coleman / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
At the halfway mark of a two-year, $330,000 project, President Modesto A. Maidique will set the cornerstone for the commencement of an 800-square foot, solar-powered house as part of the 2005 Solar Decathlon. 

"[This] is a very exciting moment. It brings [the project] to reality and shows how far we have come and how much more we still have to go. But it is probably the biggest step we can take towards actually going to D.C.," project manager Joshua Freese said.

 Although event organizers have yet to produce an official completion date for the solar event, FIU participants hope to complete the project by November 2005. 

With help from a pool of over 300 students drawn from the School of Architecture and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, the College of Engineering will compete against 18 college teams from around the world in ten contests over ten days. 

The purpose of the contest design, build and operate the most livable and energy-efficient completely solar-powered house.

"This project is perhaps the first one at FIU to have students and faculty across the disciplinary boundaries work together and fulfill a mission that has significant social, environmental and educational impacts," project faculty leader and faculty advisor Yong. X Tao said. "The current high education structure often makes it difficult to implement. The FIU Solar Decathlon is an excellent project that could execute this concept." 

FIU had been notified of their acceptance into the Solar Decathlon in the spring of 2003 after submitting a lengthy proposal detailing its plans to the U.S. Department of Energy, the event's main sponsor. 

"We're such an upstart program that when they sent us the acceptance letter, they got the name of our school wrong," Freese said in an interview after receiving the acceptance letter. "When we saw that, we experienced this instance of total clarity. We became totally motivated."

According to the engineering assistant director and fund raising coordinator Stephanie Strange, the acceptance letter was the beginning of months of planning and research.

"The rule book for the project is a half an inch thick, so not only did we have to research solar energy, construction and architecture, but we had to figure out how to build it [at FIU], deconstruct it and rebuild it [at the National Mall]," Strange said. "We set up teams to help with communication, funding, architecture, engineering and many others in order to prove to the DOE [Department of Energy] that we had been successful at [the architectural design and engineering report] stage."

Because the project is at the halfway mark of the competition, different parts of the design and planning stage have been submitted to the DOE. FIU is one of only a handful of teams which met the DOE requirement on setting up the team website, according to Tao.

Out of 19 teams only seven websites were uploaded onto the DOE website at the deadline including FIU, the University of Madrid and five teams that had competed in the inaugural 2002 Solar Decathlon. 

Although the uploading of the website means that the team is on track with the project, finding the necessary resources and funding needed to build the house has presented a challenge. But, students feel that the hassle is worth the overall outcome of the competition.

"You have to really understand the magnitude of the project from the get-go.  It's a lot of work and a slow process that has intense moments over a long period of time," Freese said. "It was disappointing to hear that most funds and products have to be accrued by students...it's a lot of work but most people are really enthusiastic to help us out."

Judged on innovation, creativity and design, FIU students will have to build elaborate energy systems and design a house that is livable based on the solar energy requirements set up by the competition. The space will feature one bedroom, one bathroom, a kitchen and an office area. The only aspect of the solar house that will not work is a toilet due to the event's restrictions on sewage and wastewater use. 

The competition also requires that the house be able to generate enough energy to power a refrigerator, communication outlets, hot water, and lighting. As an added feature, the participants must also run a home business and use stored solar energy to print, send and receive faxes and even surf the Internet. 

During the event itself, approximately six people including one observer will continually "live" in the house, doing everything from preparing food to creating a website and conducting live tours of the house for the visiting public.  

As part of the competition, senators, congressmen and Solar Decathlon judges will be driven around the "Solar Village" at the event's site at the National Mall in Washington D.C., in an electric car. Not only will the electric vehicle be used for sightseeing, but it will also allow competitors to use any excess power that was collected and stored during the competition.

An energy point system will help judges decide on the design, build and operation of the house and will help determine how efficient and effective the solar energy was used throughout the 21-day event.  

Students will get the opportunity to work together and gain hands-on experience that they would normally not be able to learn in the classroom or out in the commercial field. 

"As architects and engineers we spend most of our careers working in team design sessions," Freese said. This is the perfect simulation of a real world experience with team members from more than five majors putting their efforts towards the project."

Because the construction of conventional homes is becoming more costly, FIU students and faculty feel that research acquired as a result of the Solar Decathlon may prompt homeowners in the future to consider solar energy as an alternative.

"The concept of directly using solar energy as a power source for a residential house is not new.  What is new is how to make the use of this technology a market and economic reality," Tao said. "Right now, very limited, if any, real estate development actually promotes the use of solar energy. Students are the hope of the future."  

The groundbreaking event will take place on Sept. 24 at 11:30 a.m. on the East Lawn of the Engineering Center. For more information check out FIU's Solar Decathlon website at www.solar.fiu.edu.

Headline: Kerry supporters offer Nader backers a chance to trade votes
Author: Dawson Bell / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry's supporters have a vote-trading plan to prevent third -party independent candidate Ralph Nader from being a spoiler in states where the outcome of the presidential race is close.

The concept, first tried in 2000, is to get supporters of Nader to vote for Kerry in battleground states in exchange for votes by Kerry supporters for Nader in states where the outcome-and critical electoral votes-is not expected to be close.

A coalition of groups has formed a Web site called www.votepair.org to serve as a clearinghouse for those who want to swap votes. 

Internet vote trading made its debut in the 2000 election as a means to protect Democrat Al Gore from Nader.

In theory, Nader supporters could make their point without helping to contribute to the election of President Bush. It didn't work out in 2000.

So they're ready to try again this year to swing enough votes to make a difference in any state that ends up in a virtual dead heat as Florida did in 2000. 

Hoping to avoid some of the legal difficulties that plagued the effort in 2000-several Web sites closed down before the election after state officials in California and elsewhere suggested the scheme might be illegal-the 2004 version is called "vote pairing."

Its slogan is "uniting progressives through strategic voting." 

"The vote-pairing movement believes that another Bush administration will be four more years of disaster for the American people," votepair.org asserts. Liberal swing state voters who agree to withhold a vote for Nader or this year's Green Party candidate David Cobb, casting ballots for Democrat John Kerry instead, could help avoid "perpetual war" and save the environment and women's rights at the same time, the site claims. 

Marc Randazza, a Florida constitutional lawyer working with the group, said Tuesday the arrangement is legal and provides an outlet for people who "want to promote progressive third parties without handing the election" to Bush. 

Bush supporters regard it as somewhat sleazy, if not outright illegal.

"It's an indication that the Democrats are abandoning efforts to get people to vote for their candidate," said Heather Layman, a Republican National Committee spokeswoman. 

"It speaks volumes about their confidence in running this campaign on Senator Kerry's record." 

Nader, who tried and failed to get the Reform Party nomination in Michigan, is running as an independent after a largely Republican Party-sponsored effort to collect his petition signatures.

Kerry's campaign in Michigan, asked to comment on the vote-swapping operation Tuesday, insisted on keeping a respectful distance. 

Spokesman Rodell Mollineau said the campaign was not encouraging the effort and would have no direct comment upon it.

"Voting is a very serious issue," he said. "We want people to vote for John Kerry ... and we think they will because he's the best candidate." 

A spokesman for the Nader campaign could not be reached.

How much impact a successful vote-swapping operation could have is open to speculation. The groups involved in the 2000 election claimed to have "helped 36,000 voters exchange pledges." But how many of the 36,000 actually followed through is impossible to know. Nader received 84,165 votes in Michigan in 2000, about 2.0 percent. Gore had 51 percent of the vote. Democrats have made more active efforts to marginalize Nader this year and he is regarded as less of a threat to Kerry than he was to Gore. Michigan law prohibits the provision of "any valuable consideration" (such as money, gifts or prizes) in exchange for a vote. Proponents of vote swapping insist their arrangement is legal.

Headline: Lecture tackles Haitian politics, culture
Author: Maria Merzeau / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In celebration of Haiti's current bicentennial year, Haitian politics and culture became the main concern of the Sixth Annual Eric E. Williams Memorial Lecture held at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, UP, on Sept. 17.

Around 500 students, faculty and members of the community turned up for the lecture, a program brought about by the joint cooperation of FIU, the Eric Williams Memorial Collection at the University of the West Indies, the Haitian Bicentennial Committee and the city of Miami.

"We were very pleased with the outcome of the lecture," said Carole Boyce Davies, African-New World Studies program director. "We were able to accommodate everybody fine."

The first speaker introduced was Robert Fatton Jr., a noted government and foreign affairs professor at the University of Virginia and author of several books focusing on the workings of Haitian politics. His discourse focused on Haiti's long political history and the country's varied patterns of crises. As a metaphor for the massive turmoil caused by the nation's former administration, Fatton referred to Haiti's political history as the "politics of the belly."

"The rise, overturn, restoration and forced departure of former president Jean Beltran Aristide, symbolizes the politics of the belly," Fatton said.

Following his lecture, renowned Haitian writer Edwidge Danticat joined Fatton as a last-minute replacement for Caribbean novelist George Lamming who could not attend due to bad health and unstable weather conditions. 

Danticat read excerpts from some of her work, including an unfinished prose piece titled Legends, about a mother living in New York who tells her daughter stories of her Haitian childhood. Among these is a harrowing account of Haiti's first American invasion in 1915. 

The lecture was held in honor of Eric E.Williams, a noted historian who published in 1944 his landmark book in Caribbean history, Capitalism and Slavery, about the abolition and emancipation of British West Indian slaves. He was also the first Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago for 25 years.

Many students from FIU attended the lecture. Laurette Pierre, an international relations graduate, has been attending the event for the last four years. Of Haitian descent, she feels the speakers often reach out to people outside the community.

" I thought that the lecture was very informative. It helps people who are not from Haiti understand better what is going on politically and economically [in the country]," she said.

Some students, when reflecting on the knowledge gained from the event, expressed interest in more programs of the sort.

"The lecture opened my eyes to the political situation in Haiti," said Nzinga Mack, a graduate student of ethno botany. "It was very informative. I hope to see more programs like this in the future, not just once a year."

Headline: Meth and Red get ready to crash FIU stadium
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Attending football games to watch the team battle against other opponents are not the only reason to attend anymore. This Saturday Sept. 25, the football game will be highlighted by a post game concert featuring Method Man and Redman.

The Student Programming Concert along with FIU athletic officials has been working hard since the summer to put together a mega concert for students.

Athletic Director Rick Mello is excited about giving back to the students and honoring Saturday's game as fan appreciation day. The first purpose for having the concert was to honor fans,

"We want the to be a token of appreciation for students for all the support they have given athletics," said Mello who let SPC pick out the performances.

The football team needs to have an average of 15,000 fans per game this season in order to maintain Division I-A status. Rick Mello is hoping that the game will pack the stadium with over 18,000 fans who was once of the purposes for having the concert..

SPC Concerts Chair Frank Perez considers the concert huge for the university and what he hopes will be the first of many mega concerts to come."The concert should be positive because it helps the football team get attendance and get us bigger concerts here in the future," said Perez who has been working hard organizing the event. 

Method Man and Redman currently have a show on FOX and have been two of the most influential rappers since the 90's. Method Man was part of Wu Tang Clan and recently released Tical O: The Prequel which included the hit song What's Happenin' with Busta Rhymes.

The success of Method Man and Redman are what convinced the SPC concert committee to bring the duo. 

Other artist who were disused included Kayne West and Missy Elliot but because of history, Method Man and Redman were a better option.

All summer the football committee, us at SPC, and athletic department, we were discussing who we would bring.  With their show they have more exposure. They are classic, not temporary and have been around for a long time," Perez.

"This is my first year here at FIU and I'm super excited to attend the football game because Method Man and Redman are going to be there," said freshman Rebecca Casas who also got tickets for five of her friends. 

Advertising is also taken place through 103.5 The Beat. Every morning, the world famous Beka Boys are giving away tickets during their show. The Duo will perform a full show scheduled for over 60 minutes. Fans wishing to attend will need to arrive by the end of the second half in order to be allowed into the stadium.  

At press time, it has yet to be confirmed whether the All American Rejects were going to peform at the event as scheduled.

Headline: The taste of Success
Author: Shane Howard / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For most, college is just a pit-stop on that long road trip to destination: career. You can either continue on that path or find a way to reach the finish line quicker.

Charles Smith, 25 and a junior in the School of Hospitality Management at the Biscayne Bay Campus, is taking five classes this semester, working as a chef at the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne and is a party promoter. 

Smith also had his own catering company when he lived in New York.

The catering business started small. "I baked cakes and would work my mother's tea parties," said Smith. 

Promoting parties in New York enabled him to expand his catering company. Business cards were laid out at the parties where he supplied the food.

Leaving New York to attend school in Florida caused Smith to put the catering business on hold. 

"I don't want anyone using my name and not cooking something the way I would cook it." Those who still call will be referred to someone else who Smith has networked with. Uptown Promotions is the name of his party promotion company. Smith teams up with Philip Calloway and Lia Ames to run the company that promotes The Corner, a club in Coconut Grove. 

The aptly named club sits on the corner of Mary and Oak where the trio will throw a party once a month featuring hip-hop and reggae music. 

They hope to eventually throw parties bi-weekly. "We're trying to get the 21 and over crowd," said Ames. 

Calloway, 21 also goes to FIU while Ames, 19, is a sophomore at the University of Miami. "The First Lady of Uptown," as Ames likes to refer to herself, is majoring in International Studies but plans on switching to Communications. 

She also works at Alonzo Mourning's barber shop as a receptionist and is an assistant at Vibrant Films and Pro Link Media.  

"[I'm] trying to get my hands dirty, meet some people," Ames said. She also occasionally acts and models.

With so many activities to preoccupy them, one would think their grades would suffer but Smith says he has a 3.2 G.P.A while Ames maintains a 3.0. 

Sleep is minimal, but it is all worth it for Smith who wants to return to New York once he graduates and increase his business as much as possible.

 Ames hopes to open a women's clothing boutique. 

The Uptown Promotion's logo, a martini glass, seems appropriate for the three students who reflect the company motto: Uptown- Shaken not Stirred.

Headline: Party-goers "Rock the Vote" at local nightclub
Author: Ty Wright / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Campaigners, government officials and party-goers crammed Flavour Nightclub in Coconut Grove, Friday September 17th, along with FIU students and top marketing affiliates to "Rock the Vote!"  

Ad2 Miami and Rock the Vote collaborated forces to host its first annual Ad2 Miami Rock the Vote Party in efforts to increase the voting registration demographic amongst 18 to 32 year olds.

With time closing in on the one of the most divided presidential elections to date, each vote counts and supporters are doing what they can to insure that everyone is employing their right to make a difference.

Current and former FIU students participated in this event to preserve and support their prospective careers in areas such as journalism and marketing.  

Ad2 Miami president, Annette Diaz, expresses "the voice of the advertising industry has to be heard too. Our concern is that tax will be imposed on the industry that will be damaging to our economy and jobs."  

Former Florida Governor, Bob Martinez, attempted to force a service tax on the advertising industry during his tenure in and had it repealed 6 months after its' initiation because of the negative effects that began to harm Florida's economy. 

 Diaz continues "This will cause the industry to relocate and conduct business in other states such as New York that doesn't get taxed."

Ad2 Miami is an organization that creates events to educate its members to produce a constructive transition into the marketing workforce.  

It helps newcomers to network in all aspects of the marketing industry and generates important business connections.  

Connections that are essential for FIU students such as Ana Olivares, journalism major and Ad2 member.  

"It's a great opportunity for young people to come out, mingle with government officials that are not always accessible to hear our concerns" states Olivares.  

"We can have a good time and support what we believe in.  This is not a formal atmosphere and it gives people a chance to be themselves and discuss the issues."  

Some of those issues were addressed by Frank Gonzalez, a candidate for the House of Representatives District 21, and opponent of Lincoln Diaz-Belart, who remains unopposed for 5 terms.  Gonzalez expresses, "96 percent of 18 - 20 year olds and 88 percent of 20 - 29 year olds did not participate in the voting process last term.  

That is a large power that did not utilize their voting power."  Gonzalez also addressed the inevitability of the military draft, referred to it as slavery, 

"It's forcing individuals to do what they don't want to do.  When you are issued to go against your will, that is slavery."

The thoughts expressed by some students were that they probably would not have made the effort to go out of their way to find a government building to register to vote. 

 Many people made use of the voting registration table near the entrance of Flavour Nightclub provided by The Outreach department of the Miami-Dade County Elections department, also in conjunction with Rock the Vote.  

Robert Pesantes, an Outreach employee, was readily available to assist with any questions concerning the registration or voting process. 

 Also occupying the lobby of Flavour was a demo electronic voting both that Pesantes reviewed the steps for curious participants.

Although the purpose of the Ad2 Miami Rock the Vote Party was to register voters, you could not sense it in the atmosphere.  

Guests of the event where simply asked if they had had the opportunity to register upon their arrival and entrance into the club.  

If they had not been able to register previously they were made aware of the registration table.  

Throughout a night of mingling, brain picking and enjoyment, most guests' curiosity found its own destiny at the registration table.

Headline: FIU students and alumni collaborate for art
Author: Armando Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The room is dark and the floor is covered with sawdust. The walls are bare and a video is being projected on the ceiling. This does not look like an art gallery, but that is exactly what the artists of MSG Newness want you to think.

There are no white walls, no careful lighting and no organized display inviting the viewer to a nonchalant walk around the gallery. 

Instead, MSG forces the audience to pay attention by making it uncomfortable to move around the room.

"Eau de Artiste: Synchronize" opened its doors Friday night of the Leonard Tachmes Gallery in North Miami.  It was MSG's first solo show. 

The group of a dozen artists, the bulk of them FIU students and alumni, have been showing together for over a year at local art galleries. 

In this gallery, the artwork is not for sale.  Instead, MSG is using the gallery to present an installation show that promotes "Eau de Artiste," their brand of bottled water.  The projection on the ceiling is playing commercials promoting the water upon your arrival. 

Two chicken wire structures capture your attention. They look like pine trees with branches made of torn pieces of carpet lining.  

Behind them, two plywood boxes with monitors inside are playing more commercials for the water.  

"I think anything can sell anything and I think that is why this works," FIU graduate and artist Carlos Rigau, 28 said. "Advertisers today don't need to show you the product to sell," he said. "They present you with an idea first, with happiness and fun, and then slam you with the Coke at the end." 

The first section of the installation used raw elements. "We are using inside-out materials, stuff you don't see," artist Chad Harris, 22 said. "The work is about building and changing, alteration and revealing," he said.

Bottles of water are scattered around the room, giving the impression that they were forgotten. 

"We want it to feel like the work came together without us, like it naturally formed in here," artist Ariel Tudela, 21 said.

With so many narrow-minded artists who collaborated to make one cohesive work, it was inevitable that the work had different meanings for different people.  

"They work great together, they are infectious," gallery owner Leonard Tachmes said.   He had not seen the work until the opening night. "To me the work is apocalyptic, an end of the world scenario," he said.

MSG encouraged diverse interpretations of their work. They wanted audiences to experience the work without any knowledge or information of what is inside the gallery.  

"We were telling the audience to think what they want to think," Harris said. 

He was interested in what people had to say about the work and their reaction to it - whether it was positive or negative. "We want to break with the apathetic attitudes of gallery-goers and make things challenging to people," he said.

"I find it weird and strange, but I also find it interesting," art enthusiast Aurora Dominguez, 52 said. "Why the water?" asked Maraca Besa, 27. "At first, I didn't know how to react," she said. "I wasn't expecting something like this."  

The plurality of opinions within MSG made their work very broad. 

Thus, the installation was not a statement, but a challenge to what a gallery could be. It was also a challenge to the audience if they considered the difference between art and artifact.

The second section of the installation had a different mood. The light was up and there were only two objects.

 The first was a rectangular fish tank. Placed on a red cloth, the tank contained three living piranhas and a handful of goldfish. 

Opposite to it rests a golden laboratory sink, humming and reflecting light from within. 

The gold and red elements gave the space a sense royalty, which contrasted with the raw and crude mood of the first section.  

The second space was more welcoming but had less to offer. Yet, it continued to push the line between what is art and what is not.

The installation will be shown at the Tachmes Gallery until October 16.

How audiences react to this kind of work, in the long run, will affect the way MSG continues to produce work. 

"We are happy to be creating work that is both challenging to the viewer and to ourselves," Tudela said.
