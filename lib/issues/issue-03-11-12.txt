Association of Computer Machinery held its first annual awards

FIU's Association of Computer Machinery held its first annual Information and Technology Awards last Friday afternoon in the Green Library (UP).

According to the organization's website (www.cs.fiu.edu/~acm), this show was put on to honor the most outstanding students and projects from the schools of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Management Information Systems, Computer and Video Music, and Art students who have outstanding technical abilities.

"Initially the purpose of the show was to promote projects from FIU's technological classes. Later we decided to feature visual arts students' work as well," said Juan Carlos Agudelo, founder and organizer of the show and a member of the association.

The visual arts students' work was on display outside of the room and in the library breezeway. Also, the Electric Music department of FIU's School of Music handed out a free compact disc featuring music composed and played by FIU students. 

Estate Gift to create a $500,000 scholarship endowment at FIU

FIU has been given $335,000 by the Estate of Lucille E. Snaith, allowing for the creation of two scholarship endowments that will help the University in its high school recruitment efforts.  

When matched with state funds, the endowment available will exceed $500,000. The larger part of the scholarship endowment will create a four-year Lucille E. Snaith Memorial Honors College Scholarship program, which will give students from Miami-Dade and Broward counties a scholarship to attend The Honors College. 

The second, smaller gift will allow students to enroll in other schools and colleges at FIU by means of the Lucille E. Snaith Memorial Scholarships. 

The first scholarships will be awarded to students in the fall 2004. For more information about the Lucille E. Snaith Memorial Honors College Scholarship, contact Assistant Dean Caryl Grof at grofc@fiu.edu.

FCC slaps AT&T with fine over alleged telemarketing calls

The Federal Communications Commission fined AT&T corp. $780,000 for phoning customers who had asked not to be called again in accordance with the "do not call" rules in place for telemarketers. AT&T denied the allegations and proposes to challenge the fine, saying the charges are overstated. 

The FCC claims that AT&T repeatedly solicited 29 consumers on 78 separate occasions over the last 12 months. The total amount the FCC is seeking is $10,000 for each call.  Although the alleged violations don't involve provisions of the new national do-not-call list, the complaint says AT&T violated a long-standing FCC rule that requires telemarketers to honor company-specific no-call lists. 

By law, the request must be honored regardless of whether the consumer's number is in the national registry. Under FCC rules, AT&T has 30 days to file a response explaining why the fine should be reduced or eliminated. The FCC says they will consider the response and issue a second order that upholds, reduces or eliminates the fine all together. Prior to the FCC's enforcement the fine against AT&T, previous violators of company-specific no-call lists have only received warning letters stating the maximum fine for such violations is $11,000 per call. The list now contains 54.3 million phone numbers.

Headline: Johnson, newcomers lead men's basketball to exhibition win
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Led by a 21-point outing by forward Taurence Johnson and some key contributions from some new faces, the Golden Panthers opened the season with a 64-56 victory over Barry University in an exhibition game at the Golden Panther Arena.

FIU started off slow, but got things going soon afterwards.

Barry opened the game with a 7-1 lead, but newcomer Marcus Robinson hit a three pointer to put FIU within three. The Golden Panthers got hot from beyond the arch again when Johnson buried a triple, giving head coach Donnie Marsh and FIU its first lead of the game at 9-7.

Both teams exchanged leads throughout the first half until FIU pulled away on a key steal by Harry Lum. Lum stole the ball and converted a layup just before the half to give the Panthers a 30-24 edge at halftime.

Robinson was limited to nine minutes in the first half due to foul trouble, but that was no problem in the second as he was the only player to play the entire half. He opened up the half with a three and FIU never trailed after.

Going an entire half without resting is part of the ritual for Robinson.

"At my junior college [South Mountain] I used to go the entire game without sitting down. It's all about pacing your self. You can rest a little on offense, but you always have to play hard on defense," said Robinson, who led NAIA Division II last year in scoring with 25.6 points per game.

Johnson was also all over the court during the second half. He finished the game 7-of-10 from the field with a pair of steals and five rebounds. 

With FIU up 47-43 with 11 minutes to go, Johnson was fouled on his way to the basket, but managed to make the shot plus the free throw. This sparked the Golden Panther Arena crowd of 403 in attendance.

Barry closed in on the score on a pair of buckets by game-leading scorer Nick Ellingsworth-Perez to tie the game at 50 with eight minutes to go in the game. The score remained tied with just under six minutes to play in the game, but center Byron Burnett hit one of two free throws to regain the lead for FIU. Robinson followed Burnett's free throw with another key bucket to extend the Golden Panther lead to three points.

"I liked the fact that when the score was 50-50, we had to step up and have key plays to win the game and I think out kids did that," said Marsh.

The Golden Panthers finished the game with tight defense. Johnson put an end to a short Barry run with a key steal followed by a lay-up with four minutes to go in the contest.

With just under two minutes to go, FIU gained its biggest lead of the ball game at 63-52. FIU slowed down their tempo and sealed the victory.

Despite the win, Marsh was critical of his team.

"We have a long way to go; we're a little rusty. We have to do something about the six to 17 turnover margin," Marsh said, comparing his team's low assist total to its high turnover tally. But Marsh was impressed with his team's improved free throw shooting (20-of-28), which was a weakness for his team last season.

Headline: Volleyball wins crucial match against New Orleans
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers had their backs against the wall, and responded, winning their most important game of the season, 3-1, over New Orleans on Nov. 8 at the Golden Panther Arena.

FIU, facing the team that was dead-locked with them for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Sun Belt Conference, lost the first set (25-30), but rallied to take the next three (30-28, 30-25,  30-27) and move into sole possession of eighth. 

Both teams entered the game with 4-8 conference records, but FIU used strong performances by Julie Doan and Elizabeth Baldwin break the tie.

Doan recorded 18 kills and six blocks, in addition to hitting .350 in the match.

Baldwin recorded a career and Sun Belt-season-high 31 digs for the Golden Panthers.

Adriana Fundora chipped in with her 15th double-double of the season, with 16 kills and 16 digs.

Charlie Ball-Llovera (12 kills, 12 digs) and Betsy Moreland (56 assists, 14 digs) also added double-doubles for FIU, who plays three more games - two of them being important conference matchups- this week.

Moreland, now with 1,158 assists on the season, needs only 36 assists to claim the FIU single-season assist record. With 141 more assists, Moreland will become the FIU career-leader in assists.

FIU next plays FAU on Nov. 11 at the Golden Panther Arena, followed by conference games on the road against Arkansas Little-Rock and Arkansas State on Nov. 14-15.

Headline: Partial Birth Abortion Ban
Subheadline:  
Author: acano@pcj.edu
&nbsp;
Dear Editor,

I see that somehow Andy Diaz is once again spewing his atheistic venom on the pages of the once respectable Opinion section. I rarely read an entire column by my dear cousin partly because I am a simple man who cannot understand his syllabically-profuse language and mostly because it only takes a glance to realize that his columns and choice of words are merely his way of proving how superior he is to the rest of the human race. Anyway, rather than proceed with an ad hominem attack, I would rather briefly respond to his recent column, "Bush's ban on partial birth abortion misinformed."

Andy's use of the word "pre-human" to describe a pre-born infant is not only offensive but logically fallacious. This term implies that two (preferably married) humans came together to produce some being that has human DNA but is somehow not human. Not having the time to engage in a metaphysical argument, I will simply say that a hypocrisy is present where Andy would probably not choose to have a pair of large scissors jammed into his brain stem and then have his skull crushed, but would then allow a potential mother to make that choice for her child.

Of course, the issue of a woman's health is always the quickest to be brought up. Once again, not having room to engage in a full debate, I will simply state that for a woman to choose her life over her child's is not only extremely selfish but unnatural in the animal world. If she should indeed die, then the joy of dying for her child should be enough to bring her peace in her heroic act. Giana Beretta Molla made that choice in 1962 and was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church for her courage in fulfilling the natural law.

As for the rest of Andy's column, I'd rather dismiss it as I have to get back to my graduate studies while Andy struggles to find a way to earn his first degree. Hey, didn't we both start FIU at the same time?

Therefore, I conclude this letter by pointing out that the anti-life we're in is precisely because of the artificial means of avoiding the natural purpose of the sexual act. This so-called regulation of life has only opened up Pandora's Box when it comes to how we treat human life, from artificial fertilization to cloning. I sum up my point, I encourage all you pre-born children out there to use your stem cells before someone else does!

Headline: The Partial Birth Abortion Bill
Subheadline:  
Author: rgram001@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
Ms. Lisa Cawley, 

I was appalled after I read Andy Diaz's scathing piece on the partial 
birth abortion bill. His ill-bred commentary was both unfounded and 
offensive to human beings of any view.  It is one thing to give an 
opinion in a respectful manor but the trash talk that Mr. Diaz has 
resorted to goes beyond that. Andy seems to think that he knows 
more than most. I would like to know who told him that lie. I would 
also like to take this opportunity to point out exactly what was 
severely wrong with this piece.
A) It is quite presumptuous that a college student believes himself 
better informed than the President of the United States on any issue. 
B) Andy speaks of the Christian community as if it were an enemy of 
the state. He seems to forget that Christians founded this country to 
escape the persecution that he is propagating with his ignorant and 
pompous remarks. 
C) He goes on to exclaim that a "pre-human" is not worth saving but 
an "actual human being" is. I would like to know where Andy found 
these interesting terms and what the logic is. Does one have to take 
a test to become an "actual" or do we just have to fall under Andy's 
good graces? Furthermore, I would like to personally state that 
luckily many a mother do die, have died and will die for their child at 
the drop of a hat whether the child is in the womb or not.
D) A person's opinion is just that. However, when a person such as 
Mr. Diaz tries to validate his opinion with speculative facts and 
unfounded reasoning it is just wrong. I am sure he feels that he has 
every right to say what he said and I certainly agree. However, I do 
not think that a self-respecting person has to write such tactless 
gobbledygook to convey their feelings. 
Thank you very much for your time and I hope this letter serves to 
enlighten Mr. Diaz.

Regards,

Robert J. Gramatges

Headline: President Bush signs first federal abortion restriction in 30 years
Author: Ron Hutcheson/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
WASHINGTON - President Bush on Wednesday signed into law the first federal restriction on abortion in 30 years, winning cheers and applause from abortion opponents at a signing ceremony that underscored his commitment to the anti-abortion movement.

Less than an hour later, a federal judge in Nebraska partially blocked the law's implementation. 

Other legal challenges were under way in New York and California. 

The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a similar Nebraska statute in 2000, and abortion rights activists expressed confidence that they would prevail in court again.

At issue is a procedure that opponents call "partial-birth abortion," a relatively rare technique that involves collapsing the skull of a fetus that is partially out of the womb. 

Supporters say the procedure, known as "intact dilation and extraction," is often the safest way to abort a badly deformed fetus in the late stages of a pregnancy.

No matter what happens on the legal front, the bill-signing inflamed passions on both sides of the abortion issue in advance of next year's presidential election.

In a marked departure from traditional White House signing ceremonies, 

Bush signed the legislation before cheering supporters in a federal office building named after former President Ronald Reagan. 

He was surrounded by six white male lawmakers. 

While his audience whooped in approval, about 100 abortion-rights activists protested outside, chanting, "We will remember in November!"

Both sides portrayed Wednesday's signing as a milestone victory for the anti-abortion movement. which launched its campaign against the controversial abortion procedure in 1995. 

Former President Bill Clinton vetoed two earlier versions of the ban. 

The new law is the first federal limit on abortion since the Supreme Court made abortions legal in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.

"Today, at last, the American people and our government have confronted the violence and come to the defense of the innocent child," Bush said. 

"The most basic duty of government is to defend the life of the innocent. ... This right to life cannot be granted or denied by government because it does not come from government, it comes from the creator of life."

Bush, who said as recently as last week that the country wasn't ready for an outright ban on abortions, offered no such qualifiers in defending what he called "the rights of the unborn."

His promise to "vigorously defend" the new law in court was underscored by the presence of Attorney General John Ashcroft, a longtime abortion foe. 

Others in the invitation-only audience included Roman Catholic Cardinal Edward Egan of New York, House Republican leader Tom DeLay of Texas, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and dozens of grass-roots anti-abortion activists.

Opponents found symbolism in Bush signing the bill before six men who had shepherded it through Congress.

"It tells us again how much of a difference it makes who is sitting in the White House," said Kim Gandy, the president of the National Organization for Women.

Democratic presidential candidates, all of whom support abortion rights, issued statements denouncing the new law.

The two sides in the debate differ over the frequency of the banned procedure and the need for it. 

The National Right to Life organization considers the estimate that's used most often - 2,200 a year - a minimum number since doctors might be reluctant to acknowledge using the method.

Abortion rights advocates contend that it's mostly used to abort badly deformed fetuses. Abortion opponents contend it's just as likely to be used for gender selection.

No one disputes that the procedure is distasteful, if not downright gruesome. 

And while polls show that most Americans favor at least some abortion rights, most oppose the newly banned procedure.

The new law makes it a crime, punishable by up to two years in prison, to abort a "partially delivered living fetus," except to save the pregnant woman's life. 

Women who undergo the procedure wouldn't be subject to prosecution, but their husbands or their parents, in cases involving minors, could sue the doctor for damages.

Critics contend that the law is overly broad and doesn't contain an exception protecting the woman's health in cases where her life may not be threatened.

"Any pregnancy can go terribly wrong, and this ban outlaws medically necessary abortions that women need for serious medical conditions, such as renal failure or diabetes," said Eve Garner, a lawyer for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, one of the organizations that has challenged the law in court.

Headline: Nursing to offer new Ph.D. program
Author: Gosia Darwin/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Beginning in the fall of 2004, FIU will become the seventh university in the state to offer a doctorate program for nurses. 

Oct. 22, at a meeting in Tallahassee, the Florida Board of Governors approved FIU's proposed Ph.D. program for the School of Nursing. 

The Ph.D. nursing programs focus mostly on research and create highly qualified faculty and scientists who conduct research in health care industry, government agencies and health policy. 

Many nurse leaders - executives and administrator -  have a Ph.D. 

Highly qualified nurses are in big demand across the country, according to various studies and publications of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

"Our intent right now is to address that critical shortage. But for the most part the big need is for doctorate faculty," said Divina Grossman, director of the School of Nursing at FIU. 

Across the country, 70 percent of nursing schools face faculty vacancies, AACN reports. In Florida alone, almost one fifth of the nursing faculty have retired this year. 

The majority of the vacancies need candidates with a doctoral degree. The School of Nursing at FIU is no exception, and it is now trying to fill seven positions, five of which require a Ph.D. Six other Florida universities offer doctorate programs in nursing.

As far as the tuition cost, FIU with $201.57 per credit hour in graduate programs comes very close to Florida Atlantic University, where a credit hour costs $209.82. 

University of Miami, a private school, charges nearly five times that price: at $1070 per credit hour. 

One credit hour of the Ph.D. program in School of Nursing at Barry University costs $715. Reasonable prices at FIU may appeal to current students who are considering pursuing a Ph.D. program at their alma mater in the future.

"Now I am able to [get a P.h.D] at the same school, where the places and people are familiar," said Margarita Hernandez, a graduate student.

The School of Nursing is already seeing a big response, Grossman said. There are 100 applicants for the Ph.D. program by now, even though the school can only admit 15. The program will consist of 60 credits: 36 in coursework and 24 in research. 

Although it is possible to get the degree in three years, in reality it can take even nine years for a nursing student to complete the Ph.D. program, about two years more than in other fields, Grossman said. 

Nursing is an applied profession, and students put a big emphasis on practice and experience in the real world, which slows down their Ph.D.  program.

According to the school's official announcement, research in the new program will include advanced study of health issues among minorities. Andrea Napier, a graduate nursing student, is especially excited about that aspect of the Ph.D. program. 

She is interested in the detailed analysis of the impact of psychiatric medications on different minority groups, and the new Ph.D. program seems to be a good way to facilitate her research. 

"There is mistrust and stereotypes among different ethnic groups, and it is also present in medical research. Minorities are underrepresented in studies," she said. "For me that program puts back the 'I' in FIU."

Grossman points out an even broader aspect of the alarming shortage of nurses. As a result of the big wave of baby boomers retiring around 2010 and qualifying for Medicare, the deficit is expected to increase. The need for more nurses, schools and teachers is also expected to rise in the future.

"It is projected nationally that by 2020 we are going to need between 800,000 to even a million nurses in the U.S.," Grossman said.

The problem is that the seven doctoral nursing programs in Florida (including FIU) are not going to be able to address the shortage and fill all the empty faculty positions in the state. 

"But we can and we have to do something to help," Grossman said.

There will be two information sessions about the program: one Nov. 18 at 7 p.m. at the Biscayne Bay Campus, and one on Dec. 6 at 2 p.m. at the University Park campus. 

For more information call (305) 919-5971.

Headline: Shuttle bus transportation service now available to students at no charge
Author: Carolina Sarassa/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The University Park campus started providing a shuttle bus service, which will transport FIU students to Publix and Dolphin Mall, on Nov. 7.

This service will be offered twice a week, Friday and Sunday, from 1 - 6 p.m. 

Every hour, it will take students from Panther Hall to Publix, Dolphin Mall and back to the UP apartments.

Although this service was mainly implemented to serve housing students, any FIU student with a valid FIU ID card can take advantage of the shuttles.

"It is safe," said Clayton Solomon, UP Student Government Council president. "It was very dangerous for students to cross such a busy intersection with their hands full of groceries."

According to Solomon, the shuttle bus transportation is offered at no extra charge to students and tuition money will not be affected by this service.

Student Government Association organized this program. It is fully sponsored by FIU in order to provide students with more services, and, according to Solomon, the funding for the shuttle service is not coming from student fees.

It took UP-SGC over five months to get this program approved. 

After student polls showed support for the program, they took it to Parking and Traffic and the university finally approved the program. 

Solomon explained that to get this program working, they had to draft up many contracts, review the liability of the students, the schedule for the buses and among other details that are involved when a program is being implemented into the university. 

Although BBC has its own transportation for housing students, their program is a different service that has no connection with the UP shuttles.

Lazaro Rodriguez, coordinator of student Parking and Traffic declined comment because it is a new program, though he believes that it should be a good program for students.

"Students that do not have a car and live in housing can benefit tremendously from this program," said Ray Mora, a junior living in the apartments. 

The company providing this service is Royal Limousines. 

The shuttle buses can transport up to 15 passengers. 

"All I have to say is thank you so much," said Jennifer Trujillo, a sophomore and international student living on campus. "I cannot afford to buy a car, so this service will benefit me."

Beware of misleading petitioners: FIU at stake



To the Editor:



This afternoon I stopped to listen to a request for my signature on a petition to change Florida's constitution. The gentleman's sunburned face and weary demeanor generated an unusual pity, so I read his petition.

The petition's language is benign, more or less barring a person from holding public office in Florida if she violates her oath "by refusing to carry out, or attempting to impede implementation of any provision of the Florida constitution." The penalty for transgression is forfeiture of office.

Sounds good so far, right? The problem is that signing such a petition could be devastating to FIU. How so? There are two constitutional provisions in particular that have been delayed in their implementation because of serious budget questions.

The first is a proposal for high-speed rail and the second is related to reducing K-12 class sizes. If implemented together, Florida would be required to raise taxes and fees to cover the multi-billion dollar would-be cost.

University tuition and general revenue support by the legislature would very likely be affected if this petition were placed on the ballot and passed. Universities are heavily subsidized by the legislature and historically have taken a financial hit when the budget is unbalanced.

So, before you sign that petition to help the poor canvasser make his money, think about why you are being asked to sign and graciously refuse.

&nbsp;
Four Lady Golden Panthers were honored by their respected conferences this week - Megan Balkenbush (women's diving), Courtney Burdick (women's golf), Megan Meade and Charissa Gingerich (women's soccer) - for their outstanding performances.

Balkenbush was named the Sun Belt Conference Diver of the Month for her performance in October. The lone diver on the FIU squad, Balkenbush secured a spot at the NCAA Zone B Diving Meet with a fifth-place finish in the 1-meter division, scoring 276.55 points in the team's first ever meet.

The junior also won the one-meter competition at the Sun Belt Conference Invitational last week with a score of 244.35.

Burdick was recognized as the Sun Belt's Golfer of the Month after leading the Golden Panthers in three of the team's four tournaments this year. Her best performance this season was a second place finish at the Beacon Woods Invitational.

She currently holds a team-leading stroke average of 73.1 through 11 rounds.

Meade and Gingerich, both juniors, were named to the All-Sun Belt Conference's women's soccer second team.

Meade, a defender, was honored for her role as FIU's top defensive specialist during the season. 

Gingerich, a midfielder, scored a team-high six goals and tallied two assists on the season.

Both players are expected back for their senior seasons next year and will be looked upon to improve their team after a disappointing 2-13-2 season this year.

Headline: ASC honors Pulido, but he'd rather 'win it all'
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For Johnny Pulido, this season could not be going any better. 

The men's soccer team has already won the Atlantic Soccer Conference, clinched a spot in the NCAA tournament and is ranked as high as No. 5 nationally. 

Now, to top it all off, just last week Pulido was named ASC Player of the Week for his efforts in the Golden Panther Classic tournament held here at FIU - a two-game tournament in which Pulido totaled three goals and an assist and took over the team lead in scoring.

The only problem with this is that Pulido doesn't care too much about individual stats. He's more concerned with winning - specifically an NCAA National Championship.

Pulido, who has already a national championship in high school at American High, knows his team has a legitimate at winning the title. 

 "The goals are simple for us. We are going to try to win it all. We don't want anything less than Final Four, but definitely, I want to win it all," said Pulido.

But for Pulido, who has had many setbacks in his FIU career, he is grateful to have the opportunity this season to help his team get to that level.

"This has been the best and most memorable season here at FIU. I had to red shirt my first year after getting hurt," said Pulido, who leads the team with eight goals and 19 points.

 "This year I have been healthy and worked hard for our team to get to where we want to be," 

But things have definitely not been easy for Pulido, who besides winning a national and state championship in high school, was also voted the Florida Player of the Year as a senior in addition to making the All-State and All-County teams.

"The expectations were high and I had to learn a lot about the differences between high school soccer and collegiate. Here the game is a lot more physical and faster. They are totally different because in college there is a lot more running," said Pulido.

Entering his freshman year at FIU, Pulido had to overcome various injuries including an MCL operation, which takes place in the knee ligaments after excessive wear leading to dislocation of the joint. Pulido played in seven games but only started one and had no goals. Pulido saw action during 18 games his sophomore season, but didn't break out until his junior year, when he was named first-team All-Atlantic Soccer Conference.

But this season alone, Pulido already has one more goal than the total combined in his first three seasons.

This is also due largely in part to his head coach, Karl Kremser, who has played Pulido more towards the forward position rather than his usual midfielder spot.

"Johnny is playing really well. We have moved him up a little bit to see what he can do out there," said Kremser. "It seems as Johnny saved his best soccer for last."

Pulido's teammates have also noticed his MVP type performance this season.

"There's no question about the talent of Johnny. Everyone knows about his legs and that he is a good player. I think he is one of the best players of this team and a great leader. No question that he is a great player," said senior goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg.

"We have an excellent group of forwards and John is a big part of it," said senior defender Mark Stephenson, who has played with Pulido for four years now.

With the success of the Golden Panthers this season, Pulido is hoping it will help him get noticed and hopefully get him drafted in the 2004 MLS draft. Since he was a young kid, Pulido has always dreamed of having the opportunity and chance of making it pro.

"I want to play soccer at least for a few more years. Soccer is my life and that's what I want to do. Making it pro is my ultimate personal goal," said Pulido, who will still try out for pro teams even if he doesn't get picked up by any team in the draft.

But it has been Kremser who has been a great mentor and coach for Pulido.

"Coach has always told me that if I work hard, I have a chance to make it pro," said Pulido, who says all his coach tells him to do is "run, run, run." 

"He has always been on my tail. I either run or I don't play so I got to do what I have to do to play and go pro," Pulido said.

If soccer does not turn out in the future for Pulido, he will always have his education to fall back on. If everything goes on schedule, he will graduate at the end of the spring semester with a degree in business and sociology. Pulido said leaving FIU will be emotionally hard because of the strong bond he has with his teammates.

"I enjoyed playing with these guys and achieving our same goals together. I had a very good experience in college here at FIU," said Pulido.

But that experience might just get better if Pulido and Co. can deliver the one goal the team craves - a National Championship.

Headline: 8th-ranked men's soccer wins eighth straight game at home
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Since a 3-1 road loss to St. John's on Oct. 25, the FIU men's soccer team returned home with two straight home wins. The Golden Panthers were looking for their third against Howard on Nov. 7.

They got it.

After a quick Bobby Boswell goal and outstanding goalkeeping from Roy Rosenberg, No. 8 FIU cruised to a 2-0 win at University Park over Howard for its eighth straight home win.

It took less than 12 minutes into the first half for the Golden Panthers to get the scoring going.

Boswell received a pass from Carron Williams and scrambled in front of the goal, hitting a chip shot past Bison goalkeeper Jason Williams. 

FIU was outshot 6-3 in the first half, but Rosenberg recorded three saves to preserve the lead.

But the Golden Panthers came out strong in the second half, outshooting the Bison 8-3 and dominating the period. However, both halves were ugly, as players from both teams pushed and shoved for most of the game. As a result, Howard was forced to play with one less player when Jay Shaw picked up a red card five minutes into the second half.

FIU attacked often, but was unable to get a shot in. Howard had opportunities to tie the game, but Rosenberg made save after save to shut the door on the Bison.

 Lucas Scudeler sealed the victory in the 86th minute as he scored on a free kick from the left side, just outside of the box. The cannon shot proved no match for Williams, as he stood still on the shot. 

"It was a great free kick, head coach Karl Kremser said.

Scudeler said the goal was not a surprise after practicing his free kicks regularly in practice throughout the week.

"We hadn't had a free kick goal since last week, so in practice, we focused a lot on free kicks. I saw where the goalie was standing and I was hoping to hit it in the spot and I did," Scudeler said.

The shutout was Rosenberg's fourth of the season and second in a row. He finished the match with five saves, but only considered one an actual shot.

"First of all I don't believe I had five saves. The only one was the one where I dove forward to stop that shot," Rosenberg said, referring to a key save against a streaking Bison forward in the second half. "The last three games I have not had a lot of work, thanks to my defense," said Rosenberg, who also said he hopes the strong play of the defense continues into the playoffs.

Despite the victory, Kremser was not satisfied with the effort of his team.

"We just didn't play really well. We have struggled with Howard every year because they always play us pretty tough. I could tell during warm-ups that we were not as sharp and crisp as I'd like our players to be," said Kremser.

Kremser was also disappointed with his team's inability to take advantage of the one-man advantage, claiming Howard had men open the whole game. He was also not satisfied with the way Boswell and Mario Franca argued during the altercation when Shaw was thrown out. If more pushing and shoving would have continued, Kremser believes both guys could have been thrown out, which would had been inexcusable.

Defenser Mark Stephenson and Rosenberg agreed with Kremser.

"We had a week off and there's no excuse for the way we came out and played today. There was a lot of pushing and garbage talk out there, which I think took us out of our game," said Stephenson.

"If we want to consider ourselves and play like one of the best teams in the nation, we have to come out and defeat teams like Howard three, four, or five to zero," Stephenson added.

One of the strong points of the game was the play of recently activated defender Eythor Einarsson.

"He's doing really well. It took him so long to get his clearance to play that we are just trying to leave him in there as much as we can. He covers a lot of ground and I wish everyone would had played with his kind of effort today," said Kremser.

Einarsson was just happy to finally be out there playing.

"I was getting really frustrated not being able to play. I have to play hard to get my position on this time and that's what I am doing," said Einarsson.

Even though the final three games for FIU are meaningless in standards of qualifying for the NCAA tournament, they are very important because it will decide whether the Golden Panthers will have an opportunity to play at home.

"These games are very important because there are 16 teams that get a bye in the first round of the NCAA tournament and we would love to get a bye and not have to play that first weekend," said Kremser.

The team will find out its NCAA Tournament seed on Nov. 17 at 3:30 p.m. on ESPNEWS. Panther Rage will be hosting the celebration at Gracies' Grill at 3 p.m. and all of the players and coaches are expected to be on-hand. 

With the victory over Howard, the Golden Panthers finished their second straight season undefeated in the Atlantic Soccer Conference with a 4-0-1 record and are currently 12-3-2 overall.

Headline: Commentary: Despite loss, still plenty to play for
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Disclaimer: Please turn away if you are easily offended. The following is not for the weak-stomached. Small children should not view either.

It is simply unfathomable to see FIU trail 13-7 and eventually lose 43-10. Are you kidding me? The team that always plays hard, but stupid. Not comprehendible. Someone please tell me, because I simply do not understand how the wheels can come off so badly against a pseudo-Division I-A team, Louisiana Lafayette. 

This wasn't Georgia Southern, or a very good Troy State team that FIU hung around with. Saturday's loss was to the Ragin' Cajuns, a team that until their game against FIU had not rushed for a touchdown longer than four yards. Please forgive me, but these guys are not taking part in competition in the South Eastern Conference with Florida, Georgia or Tennessee. They are not the doormats that poor Vanderbilt has been for years. 

Nor are they Baylor, in the Big 12, having to deal with Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska every year. The Cajuns are a Sun-Belt team, a conference that FIU could probably make some noise in when they qualify for I-A.

Jacksonville coach Steve Gilbert, before playing FIU and while viewing the film from the Golden Panthers' game against TSU, thought the film was "scary". 

Well, the film from Saturday's debacle should be downright frightful, as well. 

"You have to hide children from watching this film," coach Don Strock said, "because it was atrocious."

FIU melted down faster than an ice cube on a scorching sidewalk, but before you pick up your chamois to dry up these guys up off that Cajun Field turf, please be gentle. These Panthers are fragile, wounded and appear down for the count. Peel them off slowly, watch as pieces of their road whites are still one with the sod. 

But, while you sort through the rubble, consider this: The Golden Panthers' season might not be lost yet.

Well, if we are going to judge by records, then yes. And mathematically it was lost before it even began. From the commencement of the schedule, I-AA's fourth toughest, the Panthers stood no chance to finish with a winning record. 

Throw the record out the window and forget that at best FIU could finish 4-8. Shred it up, make it disappear faster than Vanilla Ice.

There is still hope to save the season.

"Huh? What do you mean?"

This is what I mean: The Golden Panthers play their "rival" Florida Atlantic to end the season on Nov. 22. 

Their annual showdown, the second meeting between the schools, features a lot more incentive than last season's tussle at Pro Player Stadium. 

Revenge? Sure, after FIU was defeated 31-21 by the Owls. Bragging rights between friends, most of which grew up in South Florida and now play against each other? Yeah, that too. And then there's the chance to hold the Don Shula trophy for a year and establish supremacy over the Boys from Boca.

The main reason, though, is that FAU (7-2) is ranked 15th and has an outside shot at making the I-AA playoffs this season. 

And FIU will be their last obstacle as the Owls host winless Siena this week at Lockhart Stadium in Fort Lauderdale.

The rivalry is enough motivation to get Strock's Panthers to play. Preventing FAU, a team that is only in its third year of football, from making the playoffs before you do...and there you have a cheesy Mastercard commercial. Voila.

Well, before I get ahead of myself, just like the athletes are told not do, let's take a look at Gardner Webb, which is next on the schedule.

Last season, FIU came a Jerrid Lundstedt fumble, a Lagrant Perry fumbled punt and three points away from beating the Bulldogs at Community Stadium on homecoming. Please, that was FIU last season. 

This year's version is much more skilled, and as strange as it sounds - even though they don't show it always - more experienced.

Enough said: same story applies. Avoid penalties, turnovers and "little things" and everything should take care of itself.

One last key to beating GWU: Do not look ahead to FAU. 

Simple, simpler than most anything the Golden Panthers have experienced on a year that has been loaded with season-ending injuries, suspensions and one heck of a tough schedule.

Headline: Late first half explosion dooms FIU
Subheadline: Cajuns score 23 unanswered points in closing minutes of first half
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
All it would have taken was one play. FIU was down 13-7 and one play would have swung the momentum in FIU's favor, on the road in a hostile environment. The seam was there, Louisiana-Lafayette was biting on the handoff to Adam Gorman while a Golden Panther receiver was coming around to take the handoff on the reverse. 

The exchange between Josh Padrick and Gorman was botched and U-LL recovered the ball at the FIU 17 before going on to score three touchdowns in the final four and a half minutes of the first half in their 43-10 route of FIU in Lafayette, La.

The Ragin' Cajuns wasted no time capitalizing on FIU's miscue and scored three plays later on a one-yard run by Dwight Lindon. U-LL extended its lead to 21-7 after a successful two-point conversion pass by Jerry Babb.

"These kind of things happen to a young program," FIU coach Don Strock told the Miami Herald afterwards. "But they are happening too much to us. We have to be more disciplined."

The Golden Panthers were able to hang around early after free safety Nick Turnbull's interception helped set up Gorman's 26-yard touchdown run. FIU trimmed the Cajuns' lead to 13-7 with 8:24 left in the first half.

Things began to look up for FIU (2-8) after they forced U-LL to punt. The Golden Panthers took possession of the ball at their own 19. FIU called for a reverse that Padrick and Gorman mishandled, on the first play on the first play of the drive.

"[Louisiana Lafayette] had nobody on the other side," Strock said. "It was going to be a touchdown."

Added Padrick, who completed 19-of-41 passes for 211 yards: "I didn't handle it well. [The play] was right there and was going to work, and the ball just popped out and they got it and put it in."

U-LL extended their lead to 28-7 with a methodical 10-play, 94-yard drive that took 3:11. Babb connected with Bill Sampy for a 43-yard pass play to set up Josh Harrison's one-yard touchdown run three plays later.

FIU showed resiliency, driving down to the Cajuns' 36 with one second left in the first half in order to attempt a field goal. Kicker Adam Moss' 53-yard attempt was blocked by Derace James and returned by defensive back Antwain Spann 45-yards for a touchdown. FIU blocked the ensuing extra point, but was whistled offsides. Successive offside penalties put U-LL inside the one-yard line, where coach Rickey Bustle decided to go for two. The conversion was good, and U-LL took a 36-7 lead into halftime.

The Cajuns took the game's opening kickoff and marched off 79 yards on 16 plays to take an early 7-0 lead. However, FIU aided Chester Johnson's 7-yard touchdown run with a penalty on third down earlier in the drive.

Defensive end Damian Haye knocked down a Babb pass on third-and-10, but FIU was called for offsides. The Cajuns retained possession and scored twelve plays later.

Bustle gambled early on in the second when he decided to go for a fourth-and-two from the FIU eight. Babb rewarded his coaches' gamble by taking the option 8 yards into the endzone, the longest touchdown run for the Cajuns this season. U-LL (3-8) led 13-0 after missing the extra point.

"We were very fortunate to take control early," Bustle told The Herald. 

FIU drove downfield, but came away empty-handed when Moss missed a 34-yard field goal. 

However, Turnbull's interception came three plays later-setting up Gorman's touchdown. Moss, who was one-for-four on field goal tries, cut the Cajuns' lead to 36-10 with a 37-yard field goal in the third quarter.

The Cajuns' extended its lead on a 23-yard touchdown run by Harrison in the fourth quarter for the final tally.

"The guys played hard," said Strock, whose record as a head coach drops to 7-14. "They play hard every game; they don't play smart all the time, and they don't play with discipline."

Headline: University Park bus service long overdue, welcome
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It isn't easy being a student living on campus, though a new bus service is making life easier for University Park students, particularly those who live on campus.

FIU has long hoped that attracting a larger on-campus population would bring the "traditional" college atmosphere that has been missing on this campus of commuter students, resulting in increased student involvement and founding of tradition that would bolster campus life and other additions such as the football team.

For placing so much value on these "traditional" college students, FIU has been slow to accommodate those students, and many of the services that go hand-in-hand with an on-campus population have been missing.

The bus service is a long-over-due step in the right direction for FIU. The shuttle, which runs every Friday and Sunday from 1 p.m. - 6 p.m., will take students to and from the Publix across from the UP campus, on 107th Avenue, and to and from the Dolphin Mall.

A separate but similar system is already in place at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Many of the students living on campus lack private transportation, and high out-of-state tuition fees, housing costs, and the cost of living in a city like Miami make acquiring private transportation - and the associated costs, such as gasoline and insurance - infeasible.

This service gives those students a way of taking care of simple necessities - the purchasing of groceries, clothing, and personal items - in relative safety.

And while the program is clearly advantageous for on-campus students, it isn't restricted to that group alone. Any FIU student with a valid ID can take advantage of the service.

According to Clayton Solomon, University Park student government president, the program will not come at an additional cost to students. The university is picking up the tab for the service, rather than having SGA pay for it from Activity and Service fees. He credits SGA's persistence for making the service, promised by FIU administrators, a reality.

Credit goes to those in charge of getting this program on its feet, who appear to have gotten everything right in the process: a necessary service that benefits all students, at no additional cost.

Financial Aid errors abound



To the Editor:



For the past two years, I've always heard horror stories having to do with the Financial Aid office here at FIU. I've heard stories about students not getting their aid money until maybe half way through the semester, students not being able to enroll and having to pay their fees late. I never chose to believe them.

This year, I guess, was my turn.  I was approved for a $1,500.00+ loan.  When I received an incomplete check from FIU, I went directly to the Financial Aid office in PC.  I was told that the loan was cancelled because it was supposedly too much for someone who was not living on campus. The thing is, I live in Greek housing, and the last time I checked, we're conveniently located right across the street from the President's house at the 107th Avenue entrance to FIU. I told them this and they reinstated my loan.  Two days later I receive a second post card telling me that I need to take the Educaid loan course online again. To avoid problems, I did. I now found out that FIU has two loan checks totaling more than $3,000.00.  

I've been in the Financial Aid office to discuss this matter with two individuals.  I'm still waiting for someone to apologize and recognize that they've made a mistake.  The last time I checked, I'm an FIU customer as are 33,000 plus students in this university. To this day, I still have not received that loan. The only thing I have received has been horrible customer service and an offer to take out another loan in the mean time to cover their mistake. 

I guess, the thing that really bothers me is the fact no one in that office has had the decency to say, "I'm sorry."  I would have happily seeked some temporary help through a short term loan from the university or from a friend, but just the fact that no one is taking responsibility really disturbs me.  

Sure, they'll say, "We serve thousands of students each semester, we can't get every single one right."  To that I say, "Get a system that works. Integrate your computers so that you have definite access to the information that affects our eligibility for financial aid."  

I am proud to be an FIU student. The rate of growth that this university has undergone since I enrolled in 2001 has been incredible. The professors of this university are generally worth every penny of our tuition, but there is always room for improvement. Let's keep up guys!

Headline: Bush's ban on partial birth abortions ill-informed
Author: Andy Diaz/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Praise be to Allah on this fine month of Ramadan - which this year more or less coincides with the fine Gregorian month of November, heralding the 22nd anniversary of my parents' polyphiloprogenetive reluctance to abort a fetal Andy Diaz - for having invented judicial review. 

The same judicial review that will rightfully declare the new law passed in the sovereign land of Bushistan outlawing what they, in a medically inaccurate manner term Partial Birth Abortion, unconstitutional. 

I speak with such certainty not because I possess any sort of pundit, portentous ability - I'm usually wrong in my prognostications - but out of a capricious commitment to the atheist, quixotic faith that the courts will overrule the oppressive laws of our zealous administration.

In case the picture atop this column did not adumbrate the matter of my gender - which my androgynous name doesn't help - I am a man. 

This fact alone bars me in the minds of some members of the feminazi party, with whom I have enjoyed contraceptive sexual relations in the past - I'm not sure if this makes my column biased - from even opining on the abortion issue. 

My response is that having been a fetus myself many trimesters ago, I am fully entitled to comment on the issue. 

The bill signed into law by President Bush last Wednesday does not fully outlaw abortion, but you can almost sense the mental salivation in Jerry Falwell that it might lead to that as he watched our leader wield his mighty pen. 

At the signing ceremony ("a presidential pep rally," the New York Times called it) held at the Ronald Reagan Building named after the subject of a controversial CBS miniseries and orchestrated for obvious political gain among the Christian community, President Bush was quoted as saying, "For years a terrible form of violence has been directed against children who are inches from birth while the law looked the other way." 

I initially thought the president was speaking about circumcision but then I remembered the Old Testament is all for that. 

Maybe my misunderstanding was caused by President Bush's cryptic, even though scripted, non sequitur. 

As I understand it, every fetus is inches away from birth since the womb is never over a foot away from the vagina. 

I'm not a medical man; I might be wrong.Those who are medical persons don't use the term partial birth abortion instead they refer to the procedures addressed in the law as intact dilation and extraction. This procedure is rarely used and even more scarcely implemented in cases of deliberate abortions. Intact dilation and extraction abortions are generally used when the fetus is so deformed that it could harm the mother, even kill her, upon birth. 

The law does not allude to this nor does it allow for the exception leading to the horrifying conclusion that the administration in wanting to prevent the death of a pre-human being is willing to risk those of actual human beings. 

An identical law passed in Nebraska was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court three years ago. As of the writing of this column, a federal district court in Nebraska prohibited the government from implementing the law. 

Another court in New York reached a similar conclusion. The law is subject to scrutiny in a San Francisco court as well. Whether the Supreme Court revokes the law remains to be seen. 

Although precedence seems to be on the side of abortion - Bush's signing clearly violates Roe v. Wade and the recent ruling on the Nebraska law which passed by the slim margin of 5-4 - and official arguments before the Supreme Court wouldn't come for months. 

In the meantime, I will fast for the next thirty minutes. Maybe it will make a difference.

Headline: Emergency? Call... What was the number?
Author: Nicole Smith/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
This semester, I have encountered a major safety concern on FIU's campus that, for some reason, has not been brought to anyone's attention. 

I am a resident in the University Park Towers. Two nights ago, I was awakened by a car alarm at 3 a.m. At first, I thought this alarm was just another car alarm, as they go off constantly in the parking lot. 

But, upon looking out the window, I was shocked to see a car on fire. It was not a minor fire - there were flames coming out of the drivers' side window, and tons of smoke. Automatically, I reached for the phone to call emergency services. 

To my dismay, I received a fast busy signal when I dialed 911.  So, I thought maybe I had to dial 7-911, as an on campus number. That didn't work either. So I tried 9-911, as an off campus number. This also resulted in a fast busy signal. 

Meanwhile, I was looking out the window at a car burning, hoping that there was no one in the car because there was nothing I could do. I tried all of the numbers I could think of, but none of them would connect to emergency services. 

Finally, I jumped up and ran to my roommate's room, asking her if she knew the number. She has lived on campus for over two years, and had no idea what the number was. After about 10 minutes of trying numerous arrangements of phone numbers, I was still unable to contact emergency services, but luckily, one cop car showed up and was able to quell the fire while waiting for a fire truck.

This was not my first problem with the emergency system, either. Earlier in the semester, I awoke to a screaming, frantic roommate, as another of our roommates had fainted and was lying motionless on the floor. Unable to call 911, my roommate had to leave the unconscious roommate with me in the room while she ran to the front desk to ask for help.  

Thankfully, there was no one in the car that burned while I was unable to call 911, and  there was no one around the car to be injured either. And thankfully, my roommate did not have anything seriously wrong with her that required immediate medical assistance.  Both cases could have become extremely serious, as in both cases I was unable to contact emergency personnel for assistance.

Since this recent incident, I have asked numerous people, both students and faculty, what number to call in case of an emergency. 

I have been told 911, 9-911, 2-911, 7-2911. One student told me that she thought the number was something other than 911 in order to prevent prank calls. 

A different phone number may prevent prank calls, but is it worth it if real emergencies cannot be reported? 

A faculty member I spoke to, who has worked at the university for over two years, said she has never seen the correct number posted, and did not know what it was. 

Another student said she called 7-2626, the campus emergency system, and was told to hang up and call 911. She was not told the correct number to call either. 

I urge this university to consider the emergency procedures currently in place. Whatever the emergency number the university chooses, it should be widely publicized and readily available to students and faculty. 

On campus, emergency numbers should be posted throughout residence halls and all other buildings. At the previous university where I worked for four years, emergency numbers were affixed to the back of each residence hall room door, and resident assistants were responsible for posting the numbers in the hallways. 

I was fortunate that neither of these emergencies resulted in a grave situation. 

I don't know if FIU will continue to be this fortunate without serious consideration of this issue.

Oh, and by the way, in case anyone was wondering, the true correct University Park on-campus emergency number if you are calling from a campus phone is 7-2911, if you are calling from your cell phone it is (305)348-2911.

Headline: University of Penn orders committee to ban racial profiling
Author: James M. O’Neill/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
When a University of Pennsylvania professor's husband was pepper-sprayed and arrested on campus recently, some at the university raised questions about possible racial profiling by campus police.

The debate prodded Penn president Judith Rodin to order a committee to review the Oct. 11 incident and the effectiveness of the campus police ban on profiling. The committee is to hold its first meeting today and is expected to issue a report within four months.

Lance Donaldson-Evans, chairman of Penn's faculty senate, said the faculty asked for a review because the incident "did raise questions of possible racial profiling" and because the versions narrated by the policewoman involved and Rui DaSilva, the African American man arrested, were "quite different." 

The event has led to dueling letters published in the Penn student newspaper from DaSilva and Maureen Rush, Penn's vice president for public safety. 

A heated debate with sometimes nasty rhetoric - often unsigned - has erupted among students and others on the Daily Pennsylvanian Web site. DaSilva, a graduate student at Temple University, is married to Ann Farnsworth-Alvear, a history professor who directs Penn's Latin American studies program. 

She is also faculty master at Spruce College House, a Penn dorm. She is responsible for overseeing the dorm's academic programs and, by living there, provides a faculty presence in the dorm. DaSilva assists in the work.

In September, Farnsworth-Alvear sent an e-mail to students in the dorm, noting that she had three bikes to share and asking whether students wanted to borrow them. She got a positive response, so she had the bikes repaired.

When the bikes were ready, DaSilva and a friend picked them up. DaSilva had two of the bikes while his friend pushed the third along the sidewalk in front of the Spruce Street dorm when a Penn police cruiser pulled up alongside.

According to Rush's account, the officer tried to get the men's attention; "they did not respond or identify themselves, but continued to walk toward the entrance to the Quadrangle," a student courtyard.

The officer pulled her car into the entrance walkway, got out, and asked them again to speak. When they did not, she told them to stop, put the bikes down, and stand against the wall.

DaSilva's friend complied, but DaSilva didn't put the bikes down, Rush said. She said that although DaSilva might have then tried to explain himself, the officer, "trying to watch both men, was unable to understand him and was... concerned that the bicycle could be used as a weapon." The officer warned she would use pepper spray if DaSilva did not comply.  

When he did not, she sprayed and handcuffed him. He was taken to the hospital to have his eyes washed and was cited for disorderly conduct. The charge was later dropped. In an e-mail that Farnsworth-Alvear sent to Rush the same day, she described the incident differently. 

She said DaSilva saw the Penn police car but did not think the officer was speaking to him. After the officer got his attention, "Rui responded with something close to, `Is there a problem?'" the professor wrote. "The officer said something close to, `The problem is you have two bikes.'"

When the officer told the men to put their hands on the wall, DaSilva again said, "Is there a problem?" The officer warned she would use pepper spray. DaSilva said, "Before you pepper-spray me, I can explain," according to Farnsworth-Alvear, but the officer sprayed him anyway.

Farnsworth-Alvear told The Inquirer that "it is certainly not the case that Rui refused to stop. As soon as he heard the officer, he stopped and faced her, remaining in one place."

"It is true that he did not drop the bicycles, which are our property, and (stood) spread-eagle (against) the wall when ordered to do so," she said. "More than once, he instead said, `I can explain.' Please recall that a man is holding his property and standing at the entrance to his residence."

DaSilva has not responded to requests from The Inquirer to talk. The couple later met with Rush and watched a surveillance video that captured the incident. 

In her letter, Farnsworth-Alvear lamented that Penn officials' attitude was one of "circle-the-wagons, admit no mistake, make no apology." She said Rush had even called their house the day after the event, while DaSilva was still charged, and "recommended that he plead guilty and perform community service."

The couple is "happy there's going to be an investigation," Farnsworth-Alvear said.

Rush, in her letter, called the incident "a regrettable, and indeed quite troubling event." She said Penn's 98 police officers are trained to avoid racial profiling, and a policy has been on the books since 2001 prohibiting such practices.

Rush also noted that Penn police recently had been responding to a "significant number of bicycle thefts on campus, including at least one where the suspect was armed." She argued "it was behavior, not race, that resulted in the (DaSilva) stop."

Rodin, in a letter announcing the committee review, said, "racial profiling is a matter of serious concern to our community, to the city, and to the country. It is important that we continue to address community concerns about public safety and race openly and forthrightly."

Donaldson-Evans said he was confident the review committee would use the incident  as a case study to "ensure that the university's policy against racial profiling is being followed in a consistent manner."

Headline: Constitutional amendment petition
Subheadline:  
Author: tdavi006@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
Editor:

This afternoon I stopped to listen to a request for my signature on a petition to change Florida's constitution.  The gentleman's sunburned face and weary demeanor generated an unusual pity, so I read his petition.

The petition's language is benign, more or less barring a person from holding public office in Florida if she violates her oath "by refusing to carry out, or attempting to impede implementation of any provision of the Florida constitution."  The penalty for transgression is forfeiture of office.

Sounds good so far, right? The problem is that signing such a petition could be devastating to FIU.  How so?  There are two constitutinal provisions in particular that have been delayed in their implementation because of serious budget questions.

The first is a proposal for high speed rail and the second is related to reducing K-12 class sizes.  If implemented together, Florida would be required to raise taxes and fees to cover the muli-billion dollar cost.

University tuition and general revenue support by the legislature would very likely be affected if this petition were placed on the ballot and passed. Universities are heavily subsidized by the legislature and historically have taken a financial hit when the budget is unbalanced.

So, before you sign that petition to help the poor canvasser make his money, think about why you are being asked to sign and graciously refuse.

Sincerely,
Thomas M. David

Headline: "The Matrix: Revolutions": Visuals barely save end of trilogy
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Trilogies like "The Matrix" films have this bizarre way of sucking you in. You're going to go see the movie, no matter what. "The Matrix : Revolutions" brings the saga of Neo and machine war to an end. While they may not be remembered for an endearing story, these films will go down in the history books for revolutionizing the visual side of cinema and setting all kinds of new standards. 

"The Matrix: Revolutions" should be pleasing enough for die-hard fans. It gives the previous films justice, ends the trilogy fairly well and doesn't leave the audience's appetite for eye-candy unsatisfied. However, like "Reloaded," it's difficult to look at this film as a true sequel or a film of its own. The second and third installments of the trilogy feel like mere continuations of the first. At best, they behave like fan-fiction authored additions to the original masterpiece

After giving it some thought, I figured out that "Revolutions" really is plot-less. Principal characters from the first film who had been developed so well and who could have grown more serve very little importance. 

Instead, the film tries to focus on the love between Trinity and Neo. Unfortunately, their relationship is a little hard to swallow; Keanu Reeves has a hard time pulling off the affection for Trinity. Moreover, "Revolutions" fails to make us care about the characters. We watch the movie for ending's sake and although all those amazing special effects are nice, they aren't worth much in the end, unlike the first movie that moves me to the point of goosebumps.

Your eyes will definitely be enjoying themselves. When you think of "The Matrix," the one thing that surely comes to mind is visual effects. "Revolutions" is full of mind-boggling action sequences that will leave you scratching your chin. The length of the destructive Zion war scene is a little questionable and not really as stylish as the final Neo versus Smith scene, which has problems of its own. If anyone has ever seen episodes of Dragonball Z you might experience a strange déjà vu. What takes away from all these action sequences is the lack of plot. 

The visuals in the first film aren't up to par with the second or third, but they work so much better because they're backed up by a solid plot with incredibly functioning characters; "Revolutions" doesn't even compare. You shouldn't be surprised by the tragic but hopeful ending, which leaves plenty of room for future "Matrix" installments.

Headline: 24 Hours breaks up monotony
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
If there is one genre of music a local scene generally tends to have an abundance of, it's metal and its spinoffs. With an overstock of these types of bands, it gets difficult to stand out and make a name for yourself. 

Creativity and uniqueness are usually the keys to local success and honor. Miami-based 24 Hours To Live just may have what it takes to earn that special local respect.

Rob Marquetti is 24 Hours to Live's lead singer, Chad Kishick andAlex Fernandez are the band's guitar section, "White Rob" Downard  plays the bass and Brian Ray the drums. 

Brian calls the group a "mix between the old- and new-school hardcore." "When we started 24 Hours to Live, it kind of brought us back in touch with a lot of the punk bands we used to listen to. It's really danceable music if you're into that kind of stuff," he adds.

When he says dance, he's referring to the infamous thrashing and swinging motions that have almost become a kind of art form. 

24 Hours To Live have their musical roots in earlier punk bands like Minor Threat and add their own modern twist. The result is a sound similar to bands such as American Nightmare or the harder moments of Dillinger Escape Plan.

There's a certain rawness that comes along with seeing a local band such as 24 Hours live. There's a genuine desire and love for the music that burns in local artists' hearts, a passion often lost when a band goes mainstream. 

"Local music in Miami has been on kind of a downer lately. It has been picking up, but I'd love to see more diversity back into the scene," says Brian.

24 Hours To Live will be releasing a new EP on a DIY label called Gorilla Paste Records. For more information as well as other media, check out their website at www.24hourstolive.tk.

Headline: FIU Bands are Rockin' the Suburbs
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Pick any city in the United States, even if it isn't necessarily a major one, and you will find some kind of local music scene. 

There is no set way one can define the inner workings of a local music scene, but there are two crucial elements that make the machine complete: bands and fans. 

It's a beautiful tradition that spawns groups that often make it to national and even international success. 

Within a local music scene, talented young individuals have easy access to a relatively inexpensive arena that allows them to showcase their creativity. 

Moreover, it allows them to vent the frustration of growing up in today's often boring society and it provides them with excellent social practice, working with others, networking and building contacts. 

Miami is no different. 

Our city is teeming with local bands, all crawling with creativity, fresh ideas and ingenuity. 

The innovation that is sometimes created in a garage is huge, the connections and friendships made between people in bands last lifetimes, and there's never a dull weekend for supporters and fans of the bands.


"Rockin The Suburbs" will run as an ongoing series of published coverage on local music pertinent to FIU. 

Additionally, The Beacon will be putting on free concerts to showcase the bands featured in the newspaper. The first of these concerts will occur next Fri. Nov. 14 at Gracie's Grill.

Headline: Chilling Elephant offers insights over answers
Author: Glenn Lovell / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
What caused Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to come unglued and gun down classmates and teachers at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.? Taunting classmates? Preoccupied parents? Violent video games? Our gun culture in general, as Michael Moore never tires of ranting? Or all of the above?

If you're looking for answers in "Elephant," Gus Van Sant's powerful, unshakable re-enactment of a Columbine-like massacre, keep looking. 

Van Sant, best known for "Drugstore Cowboy" and "Good Will Hunting," offers no easy answers or scapegoats. He offers no answers, period. Only insights.

And therein lies the power of this profoundly sad yet chilling filmic journal, recorded at a high school in Van Sant's hometown of Portland, Ore. 

Though R-rated, "Elephant" - which takes its title from the simile "as easy to ignore as an elephant in the living room" - should be required viewing for kids 12 and up. 

Indeed, every high school in the country should order a copy when it comes to DVD: It's the perfect orientation tool, to say nothing of being one powerful deterrent.

Van Sant's premise, underscored by recurrent time-lapse shots of clouds: There is no simple causative relationship between adolescent angst and outbreaks of campus violence. A cop-out? Some will read it that way. 

Others will find Van Sant's cosmic shrug as disturbing as it is oddly reassuring. What he's saying is that life is ephemeral, unknowable, and that it's not this or that single event that pushes someone over the edge but a confluence of things, a shove here, a snub there.

Which is not to say that societal culprits don't bubble to the surface, like floating answers in one of those Magic 8 Balls. We witness a spitball incident in biology class. We see a drunk parent (Timothy Bottoms) attempting to drive his quietly exasperated son (John Robinson) to school. We listen in as three girls trade recriminations. We watch as the shooters, Alex (Alex Frost) and Eric (Eric Deulen), practice a piano sonata and then blast away in a computer video game.

Taken together, these snippets or vignettes create a sense of slowly enveloping dread, even though alone they're hardly what you would call red flags. Ditto the kids themselves, who are friendly and low-key, if a bit preoccupied, especially when it comes to a remote, hunched-over girl (Kristen Hicks) who during the course of the film pads from playing field to locker room to library.

Like Van Sant's last art-house attraction, "Gerry," this can be taken as a minimalist study in alienation. Using a handheld camera as well as an assured sense of mise-en-scene, the director-writer underscores both the immediacy of the situation and the vulnerability of the students.

Pay attention to who's in and out of the frame, who's a background blur, and who's a dot at the end of a long corridor. This is Van Sant's way of keeping us on edge and ID'ing characters as marginalized - and, therefore, perhaps expendable.

Taking his cue from Kurosawa's "Rashomon," Van Sant replays the same hallway meeting from four points of view. Again, this serves to unnerve, to pound home the inexorability of things. And when, in flashback, Alex and Eric access a guns&ammo.com site and order an assault weapon to be delivered to their front door, it's all we can do to catch our breath. The pacing is faster now, and there's that sick feeling in the pit of our stomach. You know the one, where you're watching a train wreck unfold in slow motion.

The low-budget "Elephant" is bound to become the most debated movie of the fall. Evasive and maddening? You bet. Brilliant, enlightening? That, too. From where I sit, it's the most important American movie of the year. It's clearly non-exploitative: The violence, when it comes about an hour in, is understated, almost matter-of-fact - and all the more horrifying for it.

"We should be able to pick them off one-by-one," says Alex, now dressed in camouflage and weighed down by weapons. "Most importantly, have fun."

Headline: FIU film club promises renewed interest in cinema
Author: Betsy Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Attention all actors, directors, writers, camera operators, editors, and movie-lovers who are fascinated with making movies! 

The Film Club has returned at FIU, and anyone interested is encouraged to join by the founder of the new film club, Professor Philip Church, who is also the head of the university's Theatre Department. 

"There is a good deal of frustration stemming from the relinquishing of the FIU film festival. Miami-Dade College and the University of Miami have established film programs, and their partnership can only make each other's resources stronger," commented Church.

"The addition of a new film club will go a long way to serving our students who wish to learn more about and become actively involved in film," said Professor Barbara Weitz, director of the Film Studies program.

The new film club will cater to various branches of education at the university. Church's proposal that a variety of students cover different aspects of life here at FIU easily offers opportunities to get involved. These groups of students will work to cover exciting social events, athletic competitions, lectures, and performances like those offered by FIU's own dramatics troupe. 

Unfortunately, Church predicts that FIU's future in the entertainment industry is shady. UM is far ahead in entertainment and MDC just a few steps behind, while FIU trails far behind. 

"Dozens of students are able to enter the entertainment industry workforce with the kind of basic education in film and video that they receive at those schools," said Church. Ultimately, this could leave dozens of students at FIU without the skills necessary to find jobs in entertainment. 

Due to the lack of enthusiasm previously demonstrated by several FIU administrators regarding the possibility of educational advancements in film and video, it may appear that FIU lacks the resources necessary to simply run a daily newscast. On the contrary, FIU is well equipped with a four camera-sized studio located in the Green Library, a Broadcast Video Department and most importantly, an energetic student body willing and ready to generate video clips, news casts, soap operas and documentaries, among other things. 

Among these energetic students is theatre major Denise Cardona who said, "Professor Church has never given up. It's great that he is providing FIU students with a more cultured form of entertainment." Providence Nigeria, who is an English major agrees, "It's a means of culture the school shouldn't have gotten rid of and I'm glad its back," she said. 

Professors at FIU can feel the vast amount of passion for film that circulates the school. "I think any way we can demonstrate to the university just how much interest and enthusiasm there is for film and the study of film is important," said Weitz.  

Another student who is a great supporter of Church's ideas is Student Government President Clayton Solomon. Solomon said, "I am supportive of the idea of an FIU television station. I think that a TV station will be a great addition to our growing student life." 

The word is out concerning the film industry movement at FIU, and students are becoming more and more aware each and every time Church's ideas surface. The support was made evident to Church when hundreds of students signed a petition in support of a film program at FIU. 

Although the idea was not taken smoothly by administrators, Church is satisfied to see that so many students share his desire. Surprisingly, most of these students were studying something other than theatre arts. For example, Environmental studies major Brittany McCune said, "It's a creative way for students to come together with common interests and discuss current movies and movie life". 

"The student community should be more than aware that a new FIU Film Making Club is being established," said Church. Any interested students who would like to become involved in any component of film production, whether it be directing, cinematography, music composition, screen writing, acting, producing, marketing or any other should contact Church at (305) 348-3358. Leave a  message with name, phone number(s), e-mail address, and area of interest. 

"We intend to hold a meeting before the end of the semester to create the necessary council, and discuss creative projects," said Church. 

With the Film Making Club in the hands of Professor Church, the future of the film industry at FIU looks much brighter.

Pink is back and she is not crying about her childhood woes anymore. It seems that while making Try This Pink either learned how to deal or has been popping Zoloft. Either way, her new half-effervescent/half-apathetic attitude is a welcomed improvement on her part.

Headline: "Brother Bear":  Disney warms heart, Native American style
Author: Candace McAfee / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Disney's newest flick, "Brother Bear," is a beautiful tribute to the Pacific Northwestern Native Americans. 

The story is of a boy, Kenai, and his journey to become a man. After failing to tie up the fish dinner for his Totem ceremony, Kenai goes off to find the bear that ate his brothers' earnings, only to irritate the animal and cause it to chase after him. 

His two brothers, Sitka and Denahi, go after him, and to save his brothers' lives Sitka causes an avalanche in which both man and bear fall from an impossible height to the waters below. 

Though the bear survives, Sitka does not. Kenai, desperate to right his wrongs and become a man in his people's eyes, rushes to slaughter the animal. 

Sticking to traditional Native American beliefs of one spirit for the land and all things in it, the plot thickens as Kenai, who finally kills the bear, is turned into a bear himself. 

As in most Disney films, the main character goes on a journey to correct the error of his ways, but even as a bear, Kenai lets his pride get the best of him, until meeting a young cub named Koda, who has been separated from his mother. 

A host of other forest critters  join Kenai and Koda as they make their way to the salmon run and the "place where the light touches the earth," a mountaintop that is spiritually sacred to man and beast alike.

I really enjoyed the relationship between the culture of the Native Americans and the story. The totem supposedly reflects one's path to manhood. Sitka was gifted with an Eagle of Guidance, Kenai, a Bear of Love (much to his chagrin), and Denhai, the wolf totem, was given the path of wisdom. 

When the spirit of Sitka touches Kenai, it is in the guise of an eagle, creating a beautiful image that is easy for both the character and the audience to recognize and respond to. The soundtrack, like that for Disney's "Tarzan," was crafted by pop legend Phil Collins. 

The scenes are magical, the jokes are funny and the story touching. Though the culminating theme does echo that of many animal stories in the past, it is a beautiful movie that I would recommend to all children and those young at heart.

Headline: Seven's Travels: A kind of ingenuity lacking elsewhere in rap
Author: Megan Kelley / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Rap fans all over the country have a reason to rejoice this fall. 

With the release of Atmosphere's most recent album, titled Seven's Travels, hip hop has been taken to a new level. A level, of course, that only Minneapolis-based rapper Slug (Sean Daley) and producer Ant (Anthony Davis) could reach. 

Seven's Travels is a clever compilation of captivating beats and intelligent, introspective rap lyrics, a kind of ingenuity that seems to be lacking in many hip hop artists these days. 

Producer Ant's catchy background music provides a unique mood for each song. 

The beats are obviously rooted in R&B pop culture, but do not overload the songs with overpowering bass lines and excessive looping. 

The lyrics and the beats fit together like matching puzzle pieces. 

They are masterfully mixed and come off as neither forced nor awkward, but rather as a necessary supplement to the brutally honest rhymes that Slug seemingly produces without effort. 

Slug's witty lyrics take an analytical perspective on himself, the world around him and the nation without hesitation. 

Already in the second track ("Trying to Find a Balance"), Slug mentions his constant struggle in the music industry ("treat me like a god only treat me like a leper") and his attempt at "trying to find a balance." 

Indeed, the rest of the album is basically Slug's observations of the imbalances present in the many facets of his life. 

There is, of course, no lack of humor in this album. 

"Shoes" is a funny recount of the events of a date that was "hella cheap" and ended up full of issues; while "National Disgrace" is an obvious mockery of mainstream, commercial entertainment, giving the album a sort of punk-rock feeling. 

This punk-rock feeling is the exact reason why Seven's Travels seems to fit better on Epitaph, a label dedicated almost exclusively to punk-rock bands. 

For this reason, rap and punk fans alike need not worry about the label jump. Both Atmosphere and Epitaph are remaining true to themselves. 

For more information about Atmosphere check out the Epitaph web site (www.epitaph.com) or the Rhyme Sayers web site (www.rhymesayers.com).

Headline: Pneuma stays away from trends
Author: Erika Taveras / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If you're looking to break away from mainstream music, the local band Pneuma is your answer.  The group consists of four members: bassist Nick Dossman, guitarist Gilahd Yefet, singer Jason Battle and Anthony Genovese on percussion.  Band members Dossman and Battle attend FIU.  

 Yefet categorizes their music as alternative rock, but with a very unique, melodic style. "So many groups that are coming out now are too busy trying to emulate their role models," he said.  "They strive to sound and/ or generate the image of the bigger bands out there."  

Pneuma does not focus on sounding like whatever is "big" at the moment, according to Yefet. He says that unlike other local bands that just stick to only one type of sound, Pneuma is really open to incorporating all types of sounds in their music. 

"Our harmonized vocals, off- beat time signatures, meaningful lyrics- they all form a unique sound that just doesn't come off as any another local band in south Florida. Our arrangements are tight and the songs grab you," Yefet said.  

Vocalist, Jason Battle, has set goals on things that he enjoys the most.  One of his passions is obviously music, and he hopes for a lot of success as a musician in this band.      

Bass player, Nick Dossman, also has his mind set on what he wants for the near future.  "I want to make it big with the band," he said.  

The band has recorded some songs, but they do not have an album out yet.  They are in the process of recording some more so their music can become known.  

Pneuma has played a couple of local shows here in South Florida but they haven't toured yet.  

The band spends their time practicing, coming up with new ideas, and promoting their music. All four guys have been a group since the summer of this year. For more information on this band, visit their website at www.pneumamusic.tk.

Headline: Joepye wants to heal you with music
Author: Carolina Sarassa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If you have been listening to WRPG 88.1 FM ,Radiate 88 lately, you might have heard Joepye's "Stay Awake." The kind of music Joe Pye band plays is Melodic Rock 

"It is an easy Rock" says Nicole Beltran, lead singer and guitarist. Their curious name is symbolic and has a meaning behind it. "Joepye is the name of a plant that cures sickness, and this is how music makes you feel," said Beltran. 

This local band came to existence two years ago when Beltran, after being a soloist for almost ten years, decided to put an advertisement on the New York Times seeking new members. After various auditions, she decided to join with three Colombian musicians to play the band. 

According to Beltran, it is better to work as a group because there is so much work to do in the music scene. 

 "We give support to each other onstage," she says.

A well-known producer, DJ Fluid, has been sponsoring them. He has also been a great help because he has a lot of experience. He has done mixes of Fiore, Ricky Martin and even Disney. 

Their first new album is coming out next month. It will not be sold at stores because it is an independent CD. As of now, they have not decided on the name yet. 

Beltran is originally from Miami and she has been singing since she was a child. 

Now that she has her own band, she wants to keep growing, and "go all the way up."

I asked her to give an advice to aspiring artists and she said: "Just do not give up easily, keep trying. It is hard and frustrating sometimes, but just keep trying."

Joepye's upcoming show will be held at Bay Front Park on Nov. 29 at 7:50 p.m.
