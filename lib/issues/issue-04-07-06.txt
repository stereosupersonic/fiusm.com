Headline: Players headed for next step in lives- MLB
Author: Natalie Saba / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Among the hundreds of elite players who will join in on the Major League action, several of them will be representing the blue and gold colors of FIU that first set them on their way.  

Highlighting the day as FIU's first player selected, junior Derek DeCarlo was picked by the Milwaukee Brewers in the ninth round as the 256th overall pick.  

The junior from Miami Southridge High School is no stranger to attention as he was selected as team MVP in his senior year of high school after a 10-2 record for the season and 95 strikeouts.  DeCarlo entered FIU and quickly made a name for himself.  He pitched two flawless seasons at FIU, since his freshman year, without losing a single game, along with being voted Sun Belt Conference Freshman of the Year.  

During his three years at FIU, he led the team with a 3.39 ERA, which was the fourth-best ERA in the Sun Belt Conference.  He ended a successful year not only with a 5.59 ERA and a .290 batting average, but a ticket for a promising future.

The next Golden Panther selected in the draft is junior Mark Worrell. The Florida native was selected in the 12th round to the St. Louis Cardinals.  

Worrell pitched for an outstanding 12 strikeouts in May against rival New Orleans. He first appeared at Indian River Community College in Florida where he had 77 strikeouts in 77 innings and was named No. 1 preseason junior college pitcher in the country by Baseball America.  

Another striving player in the limelight is senior Fernando Alvarez, who went in the 16th round to the Chicago White Sox.  Alvarez came to FIU from Dodge City Community College where he batted .317 with 51 RBI's and 21 stolen bases in his sophomore year.  

This year, while playing left field in 52 games, he finished with a .295 batting average and 27 RBI's. He finished off the season third on the team with a .402 on-base percentage and came in fifth in runs with 31.

The Golden Panthers kept producing players into the Major Leagues through the second day with the selection of Mario Suarez.  He was picked in the 34th round and was welcomed to the Chicago White Sox team.  

Suarez will blissfully re-unite with his former teammate Fernando Alvarez, who was also selected to Chicago the day before.  During his final season at FIU, Suarez played in 27 games and batted .246.  Both Alvarez and Suarez have signed professional contracts and have already headed out to their new teams.  

They are now standing proud not just as "ex-Golden Panthers," but as future black-and-white pinstripes anxious to hit the field. 

After being a big hit throughout his FIU career, senior Andrew Edwards is still on the go. The New York native signed a contract with the New York Yankees and has already reported to Staten Island.  

Edwards ventured to FIU as the top-seeded pick for the Golden Panthers and despite two major injuries, he still managed to make a splash.  

In 2003, he made ten appearances, nine of them were starts, and allowed four hits or less in five of his nine starts.  

He struck out a season-high seven batters in four innings against Western Kentucky and combined on the Golden Panthers' 7-0 shutout of Seton Hall in the month of March.  

Edwards ended his career this season with a 4.58 ERA, a .260 batting average and finished on top of the pitchers with a solid 10-4 record.

Headline: Rouco completes coaching staff
Author: Harry Coleman / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
When Sergio Rouco took over as head coach for the men's basketball team back in April, he promised he would find the best players and coaches to turn the program around. In the past two months, he has done that by hiring Associate Head Coach Joe O'Brien and Assistant Coach Kennith Johnson.

O'Brien is a proven winner, coming to FIU after winning three national championships for Southeastern Community College. Winning three national championships and four Region XI titles over an eight-year span O'Brien saw the challenge of Division I basketball as the reason for becoming a Golden Panther.

"I felt it was time to do something different, I was at Southeastern Iowa for eight years and I felt we had accomplished all we could winning three national championships and our graduation rate. All coaches that are at the college level want to go to Division I level, and I have a good opportunity here with a good friend in Sergio because we have a very good friendship and working relationship," said O'Brien.

When Coach  O'Brien's players at Southeastern weren't winning on the court, they were graduating from school. 

O'Brien saw 58 of 63 sophomores, an astonishing 92 percent, receive their A.A. degrees. For O'Brien, graduating is just as important as  winning, a standard he hopes to continue here at FIU along wih Rouco.

"Graduating is absolutely important, that's whats being a student athlete is all about. I am the first person in my family to go to college so I know that kids should and have to take advantage of being on a scholarship. If a kid graduates under your program then you know you picked the right one," said O'Brien, who has 313 wins and 119 losses over 13 years of head coaching experience.

Despite straight losing seasons for FIU, O'Brien believes he can help contribute in turning the program completely around.

"You are as good as your players, if you get kids that are going to work hard on and off the court, kids that believe in the head coach and are talented, then you have a chance to be successful and I think we are doing that with a good recruiting class," said O'Brien, who believes that with the returning class, the program will improve year after year.

New Assistant Kennith Johnson

Rouco finished out his coaching staff with the hiring of "K.J." as assistant coach. Johnson comes one year after taking over the head coaching rights of Lake Brantly High School.

Johnson comes to FIU in high praise from Rouco who coached him at Norland High. 

"K.J. will teach our players how to become better people through example," said Rouco at the announcement of Johnson's hiring. "He never missed a day of class over his 12 years in public school. He played for me at Norland and was the same person every day."

For Johnson, hearing the call from Rouco to come coach at FIU was an important opportunity.

"It was a privilege for him to ask me to come coach with him," said Johnson.  "I already know what to expect and how he's going to coach the guys. When he called me to come in staff, it gave my family a chance to come back to Miami, and for me the opportunity to coach at the college level, which under Sergio is going to be great."

Johnson grew up playing in Florida summer leagues. He was named twice to the all-county team and in 1995 received a McDonalds All American nominee.

With plenty of South Florida experience, Johnson should help FIU recruit local players, an area the team has lacked over the past years.

"I definably will try my best to help in that area, I just think it starts with building positive relationships with the coaches at this schools," said Johnson.

Another area of focus for Johnson will be the guards, in particular the point guard position where the Golden Panthers struggled last season.

"The number one thing is having a true point guard at point guard and that's one huge step in order for us to be successful. The class coming in, we have a guy with the talent needed on the floor which makes coaching a lot easier," said Johnson.

Both coaches have begun working with the team in order to help turn around last year's record of five wins and 22 losses.

Headline: Three NCAA tournament teams lined up for FIU
Author: Natalie Saba / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The 2004 upcoming season for the Women's Volleyball team will definitely include several new faces since last year. However, their schedule remains fairly similar. 

 The Golden Panthers will face three NCAA Tournament teams from last season.

 Such teams include defending Sun Belt Conference champions New Mexico State, two-time Big East title holders New Hampshire and three-time Atlantic Sun champions University of Central Florida.   

The Golden Panthers will open the season with a total of nine new faces, which doesn't worry six year Head Coach Cookie Stevens, despite the tough schedule the team will face.

 "Even though we have the majority of new players, I am very excited about the potential of this team," said Stevens. "We've got really good transfers coming in."

For the first time in two years, the Golden Panthers will host the Invitational Tournament with Stetson, Southeastern Louisiana and St. John's this season. This tournament will be key for FIU. 

Coach Stevens, is specifically awaiting the Buckeye Classic in Columbus, Ohio, in September with hopes to mix up their schedule a little. "We wanted to take on the challenge of the Midwest," said Stevens.

 The Golden Panthers are eager to kick off their season against cross-town rivals University of Miami on Sept. 1. 

Playing the Hurricanes is always a big challenge for both Stevens and her players as fans from both teams generally fill up the arena.

 "We are excited to play UM this year at home," said Stevens. "Every time we play them we get a really good game and a really good crowd."

FIU won't face their first Sun Belt Conference opponent until Sept. 24 against Arkansas State.

Headline: Football to host game at Orange Bowl
Subheadline: Large crowd expected to boost attendance
Author: Yanely Perez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When the football program began three years ago, playing Division I-A football was a goal but not for another five to eight years down the line. Fast track three years and the Golden Panthers will begin Division I-A this season with an even bigger plan, a game at the Orange Bowl against Florida A&M.

The announcement of the match-up was finalized during a figurative luncheon held at the Don Shulas Golf Club on Monday, June 28. The two in-state universities were represented by athletic directors, head coaches and Orange Bowl officials.

The Golden Panthers will take on the FAMU Rattlers on Nov. 27 in the rebirth of none other than the historic Orange Blossom Classic.

The event is considered an important one for FIU because the team needs to count for  an average attendance of 15,000 which is required for Division I-A as FIU makes the transition from Division I-AA. 

"This gives us the best chance. It puts the game in a bigger stadium, not to add that it has tradition and has a track record for success. With the combination of these important points, though we are a growing program, this event will guarantee us the needed 15,000 requirement," said FIU Athletic Director Rick Mello.

A big crowd is expected, not only for the game but also for the halftime show, which will feature a Battle of the Bands competition and a fundraiser that includes "An Evening with Bill Cosby."

FIU  Golden Panther Head Coach Don Strock credited the game as an important one in order to "build rivalries," between both state universities as most of the players from both teams know each other from playing against one another in high school.

The first classic took place 1933 when Florida A&M took on Howard University of Washington D.C, in which FAMU won 9-6, marking the beginning of a fantastic yearly tradition.

 In 1947, the Classic moved to Miami where it became one of the many major sports events, and till now the Orange Blossom Classic has continued to be a part of FAMU's regular season schedule. 

With the help of the games tradition, the long established event will provide the exposure and impact the program needs.

This newly revived classic will take place during Thanksgiving Weekend in Miami's Orange Bowl at 1 p.m.

Headline: Miamians lack language manners
Author: Sean Maguire  / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The fact that we live in a bilingual city should make us proud; it's a sign of intelligence and culture. But being bilingual comes with the responsibility to be considerate of our monolingual neighbors. That means being polite and following certain rules of etiquette that are designed to reduce the intimidation some people feel when they are surrounded by people who speak two or more languages with complete ease. Unfortunately, without even realizing it, we do not exercise common courtesy, and so, create an unpleasant environment.

Take the following story for example. I got on the elevator in the Green Library, on the way to class.  In addition to me, there were two guys talking between themselves in Spanish and a woman standing nervously. The conversation between the two guys was pretty funny, and occasionally they would say a phrase in English. The one I remember particularly well was "she is so nasty." The woman was visibly uncomfortable. When they got to their floor and stepped out, she asked me if I knew whether they had been talking about her. They had been talking about some party from the previous night, which I told her.    

The moral of the story is that it is really easy to make people uncomfortable if they don't speak your language.  The two on the elevator should have either switched to English when they realized she didn't understand what they were saying (it was pretty obvious), or if they were going to stick to Spanish, not burst out with random English sentences. 

We Miamians aren't deliberately rude. When you've always been able to understand both languages, you don't even realize that others might get a little off kilter when you jump back and forth.  

Nevertheless, we are often rude without realizing it. It's time to change our habits and apply some of the rules of etiquette that are common in other countries that are multi-lingual (like Switzerland, Belgium, Malaysia, etc). This will go a long way in creating a pleasant atmosphere in our city which makes even monolinguals proud of our multilingual heritage.  We can be polite, so that our linguistic skills seem charming, not threatening. Here's my humble list of do's and don'ts.  

Firstly, if someone walks into the room and you know they don't speak the language you are currently using, switch to that person's language.

This applies even if your conversation has nothing to do with the person who just walked in the room. It saves  the other person from getting paranoid and feeling like he has to talk behind your back when you're gone in order to get revenge.

 Secondly, let the first to speak choose the language.  If a person starts a conversation in one language, stick to that language.  The exceptions are situations from guideline number one, and jokes or quotes than can only be understood in one language or the other.  

Some people are proud to have learned English (or Spanish) and are really trying to apply it. You might be oblivious to this fact if you have spoken both since birth, but letting the first to speak choose the language avoids the issue. 

Thirdly, once you determine which language the conversation will be in, stick with it (subject to rules number one and three).  

Spanglish is common in Miami and we usually don't even notice we are speaking it. But it tends to corrupt your ability to speak either Spanish or English properly. It also leads to distraction. Ever met someone who constantly substitutes "pero" for "but?"  It tends to come out when you're nervous, for example in job interviews. Avoid the problem by training yourself to use one language per conversation.

If you are not sure what language to start a conversation in, use your best judgment. When in doubt, English is the default.  If you get it wrong, offer a quick apology.  Then refer to guideline number three.

Some people who look Latin,  but aren't, get offended if you start with Spanish, and vice-versa. Most Miamians have good intuition for which language to use. But they have a horrible time realizing when they've gotten it wrong. I've seen people go four or five sentences in one language before they realize the person they're talking to has no idea what they are saying.

Lastly, for those Miamians who are not bilingual, start with two assumptions until proven otherwise: They are not talking about you, and just because someone is speaking Spanish (or English), it doesn't mean he can't also speak English (or Spanish).  

When language is involved, misunderstandings can make people unnecessarily bitter, or, even worse, confrontational.  However, being polite can diffuse the situation, and actually encourage pride in being part of a bilingual city. 

Being bilingual should be a sign of culture, intelligence and sophistication.  Following proper etiquette makes it so.

Headline: 2004 young voter turnout, optimistic
Author: Vanessa Gomez
&nbsp;
Since 1972, when 18 to 21-year-olds were first allowed to vote, the voting participation of Americans under the age of 25 has declined approximately 13 percent, according to a study by the University of Maryland. In comparison, the overall turnout in presidential elections has declined about four percent since 1972.

With presidential elections approaching, polls and research show that in the past, young citizens have had lackadaisical attitudes about politics and their influence on choosing a public official. 

Some have felt their vote will not make a difference. However, there are projections that suggest that the 2004 elections will see an increase in young voter participation.

"I am registered to vote, but I don't because I don't think it matters," said 23-year-old Peter Abreu, junior and psychology major. "It won't change much, everyone is bought out anyway."

Research from the U.S. Census Bureau ranks the top 10 reasons for not voting among the registered population; "felt vote would not make a difference" ranks as reason number three among registered 18 to 24-year-olds. The number one reason was "conflicting schedule or too busy," followed by "out of town."

"Old people vote because they have money to invest, and financial reasons to elect, plus, candidates never address issues that directly affect young people, we don't have money so they won't address us. I don't think [candidates] care, there is not that many of us," said Abreu.

In fact, Census data does suggest that regardless of the reason, the 25-and-over population votes appproximately 20 percent more on average than the 18-to-24 population of registered voters.

Voters between the ages of 18 and 24 have had the worst turnout of any age group in every congressional and presidential election since 1980. 

For example, of the 10 million eligible voters between the ages of 21 to 24, only 37.2 percent were registered to vote in the 1994 congressional elections, and only 16.5 percent actually voted. 

The 1992 Clinton-Bush election showed improvement with 38.5 percent voting in, yet this is still less than half of the voting population for this age group. The '60s, on the other hand, saw more than half of 11 million young voters (ages 21 to 25) taking to the polls, this according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

 18-year-old, Anabel Betancourt, sophomore and business major, believes that the voter turnout is directly related to the events of the times. 

"I am sure that people voted in the '60s and '70s because of the war, no one wanted to go to war, that is why hippies were so extreme. I bet you more people will vote this year, not many people that I know agree with us going to Iraq," said Betancourt.

Within the last few years organizations like Rock the Vote and Youthvote, along with other party-affiliated groups, have taken to motivating the younger population to participate in the election process.

Research done by MTV network, which sponsors Rock the Vote, found that more young people say they will vote in the 2004 elections than at any time in the 1996 and 2000 elections. 

In October 2003, 39 percent of 17 to 24-year-olds said they were certain they would vote in 2004; that is 30 percent higher than the previous highest point in 1999. 

"I am going to vote this year," said 20-year-old sophomore, Ezequeil Blanco. "Look at what happened last year. Who says one vote doesn't count? I have never voted, but there are some things I don't agree with that are going on now. I think my vote will help."

That is apparently the attitude many young people are taking in regards to this upcoming election. 

According to exit polls, young voter turnout increased 60 percent in the New Hampshire primaries; there were 30,700 young voters present this year in comparison to 19,200 in 1999. 

And four times as many 17 to 24-year-olds showed up to the 2004 Iowa caucus than at the 2000 caucus.

"Enough recounting," said Blanco, "this year there should be no doubt on who the winner is."

Headline: Memorable tunes rock summertime
Author: John Lovell / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
There are two distinct ingredients that define great American summers.  The warm drives to and from the beach wouldn't be the same without that one irreplaceable CD on repeat and when the cool night falls.

Music makes up the cornerstone of any nutritional summer diet; forget about Atkins! 

Check out my picks for the greatest summer albums to make the next two months memorable. 

Weezer: Blue Album

Bringing back fond memories of sixth grade, Weezer's legendary Blue Album is a landmark in summer music. Veteran listeners of Blue Album are likely to recite every single word to all 10 tracks, and it's guaranteed to infect you as well. 

Toxically addictive songs such as "Undone-The Sweater Song," and "Surf Wax America" will have you screaming at the top of your lungs and swearing you've found the holy grail of 90s rock. Blast it on your beachside jam box and watch as your scene-points rake up.

Rocketship: A Certain Smile, A Certain Sadness

If you're a treasure- hunter then I urge you to dig up this gem, but don't bother looking in stores.  

The band's first and only full-length album screams summer with intense happiness that's balanced only by the under toned farewell-like melancholy. 

Users will often find themselves inexplicably blasting the poppy organ sounds on full volume and do-do-doing along with the charismatic and cutesy vocals. 

Guys take note: Rocketship's album is the perfect summer-fling stimulator, with lovey-dovey lyrics and song titles like "I Love You Like the Way That I Used to Do," "Kisses Are Always Promises" and "We're Both Alone," so make sure to add this one to your soundtracks for wooing.

The Roots: Phrenology

Repainting and breathing new life into alternative hip-hop, The Roots' Phrenology also falls perfectly into place come summertime. The soulful rhythms are matched nicely with sophisticated and interesting beats that throw back to an older, jazzier feel. 

You don't have to be an artsy coffee bean beatnik to appreciate The Roots' work of art. 

Set aside the importance this album holds for the hip-hop genre, and you have a nice body of work that's musically engaging but simply fun at the same time. 

Kick it old school with the new school beats of Phrenology this summer and you'll get what I'm talking about. 

Wilco: Yankee Hotel Foxtrot

This will make better sense as a summer pick if you listen to it in August, as the season dreadfully begins to wind down, and you gear up for another fall semester. It's a peculiar kind of gloom that makes this album such a great catch for a summer wrap-up. 

There are several moments on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot that, when looking back on your experiences, will help make sense of all the crazy and wonderful (or not so wonderful) things that occurred. 

All in all it's just a metaphoric embodiment of everything one would hope to have in the end: A good friend who will listen to all of your summer tales and laugh along while flipping through photos. 

Foxtrot is the kind of soundtrack you'd want to hear when enjoying that last red sunset and soaking in all the new memories you've procured.

Headline: Second Spidey flick a swashbuckling success
Author: Marjorie Rizzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
By now, most of you have been bombarded with corny cliché lines for the summer blockbuster "Spider-Man 2." 

I am sure you have not escaped one-liners such as "web-slinging fun" or "a new spidery sensation." 

I too can't resist the temptation: "Spider-Man 2" catches its audience with a web of entertainment

But here's why: "SpiderMan 2" is one of a few cinematic charms that manages to outshine the original, 2002's Spider-Man.

It breaks the blockbuster's unwritten rules of the formulaic action flick and becomes a flim with heart. 

The film is full of swashbuckling superhero action, romance and a youth's inner struggle to do the right thing.

Man responsible: returning director Sam Raimi.

He demonstrates how to make a character-driven drama out of a comic book while pleasing an audience that wants a blockbuster.

One of Raimi's partners in crime is talented Tobey Maguire.

He returns as the good-natured Peter Parker, who faces newchallenges as he struggles with "the gift and the curse" of the spandex-suit life.

Peter desperately tries to balance  his two identities: superhuman crime-fighter and college student. 

And Dr. Phil isn't there to help, which leads to stress taking a toll on his superhero powers.

Peter is distraught by his secrets and he finds thathis relationships with all those he holds dear are in danger of deteriorating.

His life-long longing for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) becomes even stronger, and the pain he feels for his not-so-secret love distresses Peter.

He avoids his true feelings because everyone knows superheroes can't have girlfriends because then all super enemies would find out, and the girlfriend would become a damsel in distress...wait... that happens anyways.

Adding more stress, his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) is still bitter over his father's death and continues to seek revenge against Spider-Man. 

Kind-hearted Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is still there for Peter, but is going through a financial and emotion strain herself. 

The compelling adventure continues as Spider-Man's life becomes even more complicated when he confronts a new nemesis, the intelligent Otto Octavius, (Alfred Molina) who is reborn as the maniacal menace Dr. Octopus.

This movie is jam packed with action sequences that more than satisfy action addicts and has plenty of special effects for eye candy.

I think this Hollywood movie really gets it right. It is witty and intelligent, two traits often subtracted from big-budget action movies. 

I give this character driven summer flick four stars.
