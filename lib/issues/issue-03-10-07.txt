Headline: FIU rows in Indian Creek Regatta
Author: Francisco Zuniga/Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
FIU's rowing club competed in the "Indian Creek Regatta," South Florida's biggest rowing competition of the year on Oct. 12.

"This big competition you see here, this is about the biggest one in South Florida," said Sid Mckay, coach of FIU's rowing team. 

The races were held at the Shane Water Sports Center in Miami Beach. The event began at eight in the morning and went on until noon. Coca Cola, The Miami Beach Rowing Club, Comfort Inn, and others sponsored the event. Aside from FIU, other schools participating were Barry University, U.M., U.F., and the University of Tampa. Independent boating clubs were also involved. 

The race was composed of fourteen events ranging from single to eight person boats. The teams were divided into women's, men's and mixed. Of the fourteen events, FIU participated in four: Women's 8, men's single, men's 8, and the mixed 8. Team member Henry Kupczyck won the silver metal for reaching second place in the Men's single.

"I thought I was going to win this year. I placed second and third the last three or four years," said Kupczyck, explaining that there was another competitor in his race who was faster.

 Kupczyck has been in the club for the last six years. He is captain of the men's team and assists Mckay in coaching and managing the club.

The women's 8 came in 7th place, men's 8 made 2nd place with a one minute difference against U.M., and the mixed 8 finished in 22 minutes. The winners of the competition receive medals and recognition. But the team members said they participate for the fun of it.

Training for this competition began at the beginning of the fall semester.

"They started rowing at the commencement of term. Most of them started rowing August or September," said Mckay.

FIU's rowing club has a regular training schedule that ranges from three to four days a week. 

"Our schedule is Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from four to six, and Saturday mornings," said Sarah Hammill, librarian at the BBC campus, faculty advisor, and member of the rowing club.

Hammill went on to explain that anyone can join the club. The only requirements are to know how to swim, and consistency in attending practice. The club hopes to one day ascend to a sport, and Mckay is looking to make the women's team varsity. 

Funding is also a concern for the members of the rowing club. They hope to receive more help from FIU administration.

"From what I understand it seems that the administration is sort of dragging their feet, and I think part is because we're at north campus," said club member, and junior Nick Duroch.

This race was the FIU rowing club's first event of the year. They will be competing again in December at the Regatta at Barth Club.

Headline: Audio / Visual : Pretty Girls Make Graves
Subheadline: The New Romance: Setting new standards for Indie rock
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Pretty Girls Make Graves is hot. At least their singer is, anyway. Seriously though, I'm talking about the music. It really is quite hot.  

The New Romance marks their first release since 2002's Good Health. It also marks their move from Lookout Records to indie-champions Matador Records, who enlist bands the likes of Interpol, Yo La Tengo, Guided by Voices and Cat Power. 

When you hear someone try and describe Pretty Girls Make Graves, you want to automatically think Sleater-Kinney or Bikini Kill - please don't! This band sounds nothing like either of the two. In fact I'd say it's pretty difficult to compare these guys to any other band. Perhaps Fugazi is a better comparison.

The New Romance is very diverse. There is the classic Pretty Girls sound that makes up a good amount of the album, fast-rhythms, intricately delicate guitars that sing to each other with a driving bass beat, spite-full hard-hitting backup vocals, and Andrea Zollo's sweet sweet voice that makes guys like me swoon. 

What's beautiful about for this type of music is the perfect balance in this seemingly chaotic mixture. Listen to songs like "All Medicated Geniuses," and "Chemical Chemical" to get an idea of this.

What's new about this album is that the band takes things down a few notches on several of the songs, producing music that's a bit slower and  more emphatic than their normal sound ("Blue Lights" and "Holy Names"). Other songs have a good mixture of the two, like the opening "Something Bigger, Something Brighter" and the closer "A Certain Cemetery."

Of all these songs, what strikes me is that they're all pretty sad songs. Not emotional, don't think emo, please think anything but emo. The sadness on The New Romance is honest and does a great job in making me sad as well. It's more than a cheap feeling, it's sincere and goes to the bone marrow of things. One can almost feel her sorrow and angst in lyrics such as "Close my eyes and swallow. Figure out that I am not blind or broken eared, just need to disappear, to get up out of here," in "Something Bigger Something Brighter." Oh Andrea, I'll cheer you up and make it better.

I last wrote about Pretty Girls when they opened up for pop-punkers Alkaline Trio several months ago. It's great to see them rising above and beyond the expectations I held for them then. The New Romance is a solid release and a great listen. 

Pretty Girls are shaping up to be standard-setters in the indie genre and if you have any interest in who's who and what's hot, I would pay close attention to these guys. 

They're going to be making bigger and even better names for themselves, very soon.

Headline: Audio / Visual : The Rapture
Subheadline: Echoes: Sounds like club-disco and dirty-rock's lovechild
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
If you've been to indie clubs like Revolver or if you listen to certain college radio stations who play indie music, you may have happened upon a song or two that sounds like club-disco and dirty-rock's lovechild. You may have wondered "what the hell is this crazy music?" Or you might have bobbed your head. 

As crazy as The Rapture is for bringing together two types of music that have reputations for being a little harsh on the ears, they do it with an interesting style and add their own touch to it. On their latest release, Echoes, upbeat disco drum and bass tempos that make you want to dance, are coupled with biting guitars and swaggering, screaming, high-pitched vocals that aren't always comprehensible. Their style is totally distinguishable, you can't miss these guys.

It took The Rapture forever to release a new album. It's been nearly four years since we've heard anything from these guys besides short EP's and singles. Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks in 2001, and House of Jealous Lovers in 2002 were but preludes to Echoes.

What makes this album so likeable is the dance-able nature to it. It's a lot of fun to listen to. Songs like "House of Jealous Lovers," "Echoes" and "Sister Saviour," all have a constantly driving beat, pushing with hand-claps and disco-drums. 

What surprised me about Echoes was the addition of songs unlike any other Rapture song I've heard before. On "I Need Your Love" and "Killing," the sound is almost completely electronic. It sounds like something you would hear on a mainstream trance radio station or in one of the many cheesy South Beach clubs. As bizarre as this is, it's kind of fun to listen to. 

The only quarrels I have with this album, and this band, is that I don't know what else they're going to be able to do. It sounds like I'm probably going to get bored with this album after a few more weeks. What's going to happen to The Rapture from here? I honestly don't see them doing much else. This music, unfortunately, doesn't have a very long shelf-life. 

There is hope however on tracks like "Open Up Your Heart," probably my favorite song on the whole album, that isn't anything like what I've been describing. 

It's a simple tune, slow and sad, that doesn't have more than a piano, drums and bass. Here is a new avenue for The Rapture to explore. Hopefully we'll see more of it on their next release.

Headline: Biscayne Landings sign "bad move"
Author: John Colagrande, Jr./ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
This may come as a surprise to more than one person reading this but there are five campuses at FIU: University Park, Biscayne Bay Campus, Davie, Homestead, and Ft. Lauderdale.

The five campuses are as different as can be, and although a whole article can and should be devoted to these differences, right now I'd like to address the BBC because there is a problem.

The problem is Biscayne Landings.

Biscayne Landings is an apartment complex that is being developed off US1 alongside the entrance to FIU. The entrance into the BBC is on US1 and NE 151st Street.

 Biscayne Landings has nothing to do with FIU - it is not school housing.

It's a private community, it's a huge construction job that only recently started, it's an eyesore, and it's just a matter of time before traffic problems arise.

For starters, the sign. The old sign that showcased the entrance to FIU, on the southeast corner of 151st and US1, has already been sold and converted to a sign that now reads Biscayne Landings.

Bad move.

When heading North on US1 toward the school if you didn't know better you'd think the entrance into FIU was the entrance into Biscayne Landings. You could very well pass the entrance to the school. Especially since a new FIU sign has been posted on the northeast corner of US1 and 151st, the new sign for FIU is posted after the entrance. If heading North, by the time you get to the sign, you've passed the entrance.

People will be passing the entrance. It is inevitable. I almost passed the entrance and I've been taking classes at the BBC for three years.

The BBC is one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. There is more natural beauty on the BBC than many city parks in Broward and Dade. The campus is almost a preserve. 

When you enter the campus you encounter a pleasant 1.5 mile drive before you reach the parking lots. On the drive, lined along both sides of the road, are sixty foot Longleaf Pine trees. The trees are absolutely beautiful. When windy, the Longleaf Pines gently vacillate in a waving motion. They take on an effervescent glow that promotes a stimulating calm.

It's beautiful - if you have the awareness to notice. The beauty of the BBC is something special. The preserve-like environment is reminiscent of Stanford, an Ivy League school south of San Francisco, but unlike Stanford, FIU's BBC is on the water. We're more beautiful than Stanford, how about that? To have a beautiful campus  like we have in a major cosmopolitan area is an achievement. Props to us.

Since Biscayne Landings is nothing more than an ugly pile of dirt right now, it is surprising that the sign had to go up so soon; you would think someone would've come up with a better solution than this. Perhaps over the winter recess when thousands of students aren't around they could've worked the problem out.

As is, it's a bad move, people will pass the entrance, they will no longer be in a calm state of mind, they won't appreciate the waving palms, they'll arrive late to class, they will be punished by their professors, student's grades will suffer, scholarships will be revoked, kids will drop out, attendance will diminish, state funds will slacken, heads will roll, the school will close, the sky will fall, and we'll all die screaming "bloody academic armageddon!"

OK, that's pushing it, but still, do something about the sign. It's stupid.

Bad enough this Biscayne Landings thing absolutely has the potential to taint the beauty of the BBC.

Headline: Mallo article too ignorant to argue with
Author: Andy Diaz/ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
I enjoyed reading Drew Mallo's column in the last issue of The Beacon. I like his folksy, simpleton style. His use of O'Reillyan reductio ad absurdum and his way of carefully tailoring the facts to have them produce the unavoidable cathartic denouement that is the cliché "Gimme a break!" theatric. 

But most of all, I admire Mallo's ability to be constantly and multidisciplinarily wrong - whether it be politics, history, geography or something as basic as grammar and composition, or even spelling. Mallo does not disappoint in repeatedly screwing up the treatment of these schools, and I suspect anything else he might try his hand at, with a commitment to the incorrect, is worthy of admiration as well as praise.

I will try to explore Mallo's column as closely as someone with a poor stomach for hateful nonsense can and point out his many instances of absurdity. Before I start, I must explain to my valued readers that I don't consider this an intellectual exercise. This is a strictly satirical piece. As his column shows, Mallo is not worth seriously arguing with because he has no respect for the facts or intellectual argument itself. So by ripping into his column, as it were, I don't hope to show that I am exceptionally intelligent (although I won't argue with anyone who happens to think so) but rather that Mallo is irredeemably irrational.

In his first paragraph, Mallo refers to a "Chapiqua Ted." Since "Chapiqua" ain't no town I ever heard of, it took me until the next paragraph to realize that Mallo was talking about Ted Kennedy. You see, there is a town called Chappaqua in New York, where Ted Kennedy is not from. Ted Kennedy did drive his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts that resulted in the drowning of his passenger, a former staffer for his dead brother, Robert. A quick search on Google would have furnished Mallo with this information but maybe he doesn't have access to the internet, or one of the many computer labs at FIU, or the FIU library, or the Miami-Dade county library, or common sense.

After his rant on "Chapiqua Ted," who sounds more like a character from a dirty limerick than a United States senator who, along with Ted Turner, accurately and exclusively represents the politics of the American left, Mr. Mallo conveys his wisdom through this doozy of a paragraph. "By definition terrorists do not utilize reasoning or logic. It is just like liberalism. Both liberals and terrorists utilize emotions and that is how they define their actions. I'm not saying that terrorists and liberals are the same, I am just bringing to fruition the reality of why it is impossible to deal with terrorists in any other way than to eliminate them." This paragraph raises many important questions, but of course, the salient one is: "What the hell is he saying?"

Let us not be unfair to the tragic character that Mr. Mallo has become and try to understand his amalgamation of stupidity. The first sentence should suffice: Mallo says that terrorists by definition use neither reason nor logic. I will spare you the "Merriam-Webster defines the word..." moment, but I think it's fair to say to that no dictionary would define the word terrorist in Mallo's terms. We will, however, give him the benefit of the doubt and test his theory using the Sept. 11 attacks. Within a two-hour period, 19 of these "illogical terrorists" orchestrated a four-pronged attack upon the most powerful nation in the history of humanity with a 75 percent success rate, killing 3000 plus people, destroying two national landmarks and razing a wing of the Pentagon, the brain of America's military. A coordinated attack this complicated could only be pulled off by highly knowledgeable and deliberate planners, not the crazies that Mallo would have us believe.

In the next paragraph, Mallo explains that the policy of them tree-hugging liberals is to "wait for thousands of Americans to die first before anything is done." Mr. Mallo strikes me as someone who is not familiar with the basic chronology of our calendar so I'd like to remind him of the fact that the Sept. 11 attacks occurred on Sept. 2001, which means that his beloved President Bush was eight months into his tenure by the time of the attacks, and did nothing to prevent them even though his people had been briefed on the subject by President Clinton's national security team.

I mentioned earlier that I would talk about Mallo's column as long as I could before it started to nauseate me. I have reached my limit - as I said, I can't stomach hateful drivel too well. People like Mallo produce two emotions in me that I wouldn't usually associate: pity and hatred. I pity them because they're so clueless as to the human condition that I can't help but feel sorry. Hatred because it is people very much like him who, with fanatical fervor, propagate conflict within humanity.

&nbsp;
Bush can't be trusted



To the Editor: 



Upon reading Drew Mallo's distortion of the facts in the last issue of The Beacon, I admit that I needed a couple of minutes to compose myself. I was flabergasted at either Mallo's lack of political knowledge or capacity to tell lies. 

First off, Mallo claims that Democrats completely oppose any action against the terrorists of Sept. 11. This is false. A majority of Democrats oppose violating international law and invading Iraq without due cause. Not once has any American citizen, let alone a Democrat, claimed that al-Queda or Osama "Been-Forgotten" should not be hunted down.

I propose a question to you Drew: Did the United States have any logical reason to enter Iraq? The answer is no. Even your man, Dubya, admitted last week that America has "no evidence" linking Iraq to Sept. 11. Did you miss that bit of news? Where are the weapons of mass destruction? We have men and women our age out there dying on Iraqi soil for no reason. If you feel so strongly Mr. Mallo, by all means pick up a rifle and get yourself to Baghdad. Our troops need to come home, and hopefully France and the rest of the United Nations will accept Dubya's pleas for help. He realizes that he made a mistake going at this war by himself but he's too ignorant to admit this and improve his chance for international help. 

I would like to throw out the name of the man who will challenge and defeat Bush in 2004. General Wesley Clark. This is a man who fought and served in Vietnam. He was dodging bullets in Vietnamese jungles while Bush was dodging his last year of service in the national guard. Clark will soon demonstrate his capability to fight terrrorism against the actual terrorists. He will do what Bush has proven a failure in: capturing Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.

Finally, lets talk about domestic issues. Above all, Dubya inherited Clinton's massive budget surplus, the largest in America history mind you, and managed to turn it upside down into the largest deficit in history. I'm no math major but that tells me there is some major economic blundering going on. Add that to the fact that the total hourly employment has dropped from 111.6 million to 108.3 million, while the unemployment rate has risen from 4.2 percent to 6.1 percent. Let's not even get into Dubya's propensity to throw millions of badly needed tax dollars back at wealthy citizens and corporations.

Bush must be removed from office in 2004. He is a violator of international law, of human rights, and now he's dodging new allegations his White House leaked information exposing a covert CIA spy. He can no longer be trusted to run our country, as he has taken it from riches to rags. God Bless America and God help Dubya these next two years.

Headline: Men's basketball releases 'tough' '03-04 schedule
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's basketball schedule was released this past week. The schedule is a challenging one for Coach Donnie Marsh and his team.

The Golden Panthers will kick off their season on November 21 in the first of two FIU/Hampton Inn Tournaments held  at the Golden Panther Arena. The tournament will include Howard, Montana, and Quinnipiac as first round opponents.

Marsh feels his team can defeat those opponents and win the tournament.

"This is a good event for us to be in. Anyone can beat you on any given night and right now we are just focused on the first game against Howard," said Marsh.

The team will begin its non-conference regular season schedule on the road with games against state rivals Florida Atlantic and University of Miami on Dec. 1 and Dec. 6 respectively. The team will return home to face La Salle on Dec. 13 but only to travel again on Dec. 15 to face Stanford. They will continue on the road with a Dec. 20 contest against USF.

FIU is excited about the opportunity of facing Miami.

"It's a big challenge for us and we are hoping to come out and play with a big effort against the team from across town," said Marsh.

FIU will end the month of December with the second of the FIU/Hampton Inn Tournament, which will feature Drexel, Hartford, and 2003 NCAA participant Sam Houston State.

The Golden Panthers will kick off their Sun Belt Conference schedule on Jan. 3 against Arkansas State at the GPA. The following home games against Sun Belt opponents include Arkansas-Little Rock on Jan. 6, NIT participant Louisiana-Lafayette (Jan. 24), defending SBC champion and NCAA Tournament representative Western Kentucky (Jan. 31), Middle Tennessee (Feb. 7), New Orleans (Feb. 21) and South Alabama (Feb. 23).

"The schedule is as tough as it has been in a long time. The league is now more balanced and mixed at talent," said Marsh.

The team will have a very rigorous road schedule but it doesn't bother Marsh.

"Its hard to win on the road but last year, we played better on the road," he said.

The Sun Belt Conference Championship will take place in Bowling Green, Kentucky, March 6-9. 

The winner of the championship is given the berth to advance to the NCAA championships.

Headline: Five softball players honored for off-field achievements
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Maintaining a 3.5 or higher grade point average is quite an accomplishment in itself, but it's really special when you can do it while playing a university sport. That's what five FIU softball players accomplished as they were named 2002-2003 National Fastpitch Coaches Association scholar athletes.

Meagan Dontrich, Amber Gill, Kendra Laminack, Yarah Otero and Stephanie Wolter were the five FIU players to earn the honor. The award is given to student-athletes who maintain at least a 3.5 grade point average.

Coach Kim Gwydir is proud of her girls for their off-field success.

"I am very proud of them and what they have accomplished. They are the total package. Not only did they play well on the field as we advanced to regionals, but they also performed in the classroom," said Gwydir.

Dontrich was the starting left fielder for the Golden Panthers and ranks fifth all-time in steals for FIU with 39. Last year she finished second on the team with 20 for the year. Gill, who transferred from East Carolina University last year, was the only Golden Panther to hit a grand slam. 

The outfielder accomplished this feat against Sun Belt rival New Mexico State.

The only pitcher of the five to make the list was Laminack. She had a solid season last year compiling 11 victories with a 1.90 ERA on 145 strikeouts in 144 innings. Laminack ranks third all-time at FIU with 242 strikeouts and fifth in victories with 21.

"She is one of our top players and captain of the team," said Gwydir.

Junior outfielder Otero, is best known for playing on the Puerto Rican National Team this past summer at the Pan AM Games.

Wolter, who graduated recently, was named to the 2003 All-Sun Belt Conference Second Team as a shortstop for the Golden Panthers. Wolter ranks first all-time in many statistical categories at FIU including hits (242), at bats (829), runs (136), and total bases (286). Last season she batted .314.

The softball team, which finished 37-27 and reached the NCAA Regionals, begins play this season on Oct. 12.

Headline: Frisbee Club a hit among resident students
Author: C. Joel Marino/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Since the beginning of the year, many students living on-campus have noticed the loud laughter and flying Frisbees visible late at night in the area between University Park Towers and Panther Hall. Running through mud and yelling quick commands, these recognizable figures are the 25 members of 'Ultimate Club', FIU's first official Ultimate Frisbee organization.

Founded by Honors Place residents Angelina Troff and Fabio Beltramini, freshmen, Ultimate Club opened its membership in early September and has been receiving new applicants ever since. 

"Ultimate Frisbee is a healthy, social activity - it keeps you fit and lets you meet new people all the time," says club vice president Beltramini, who has been playing the sport since seventh grade. 

Including residents from both Panther Hall and Everglades Hall, the new club has received participation from people who might never have thought of joining a sports-related activity. 

"The rules are simple and everyone can play, even if you're not athletically inclined," said freshman P.J. Rivera, one of the original club members and club treasurer.

Ultimate Club president Troff assures new members that there are many plans in store for the organization. Among these are tournaments against other schools (UF and UM included), jerseys, award ceremonies for outstanding players, and a possible faculty vs. students match next semester.

 "This is a fun club," says Beltramini. "Our motto is We Play Ultimate Frisbee. That's it. There are no other requirements, except that you come looking for a fun time."

The club plays every Thursday night from 10 p.m.-midnight, by Panther Hall. For more information, students are urged to contact Angelina Troff at ultimate@fiu.edu.

Headline: Struggling women's soccer drops two more
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
Oct. 3- MTSU 2, FIU 0

The FIU women's soccer team had either scored one goal or had been shut out in five of the team's first six games entering its conference matchup with Middle Tennessee State.

The trend continued as the Golden Panthers were shut out 2-0 at Blue Raider Field on Oct. 3.

FIU, which had never previously lost to the Raiders, struggled to get any offense going in the highly physical match.

The Golden Panthers committed 25 fouls and received a late red card, while managing only 11 shots in the contest.

The two teams combined for 47 fouls, and the game was slightly delayed after FIU's Renee Cagnina and MTSU's Jenny Cox were ejected in the 83rd minute for fighting.

The Blue Raiders (5-5) got on the board early in the 13th minute when Laura Miguez chipped in a rebound off her own shot past FIU goalkeeper Juliana Gomez.

Rebecca Rodriguez made the game 2-0 when she blasted a shot past Gomez in the final minute of the first half.

Tamara Kochen and Janet Ligouri combined for eight of FIU's 11 shots, but only two of their shots were on goal.

Oct. 5- WKU 1, FIU 0

The Golden Panthers' long road trip got worse, as they were shut out for the second straight game, falling 1-0 to Western Kentucky on Oct. 5.

FIU came out flat in the first half as the Hilltoppers outshot the Panthers 11-3 in the period.

After going into halftime with the game scoreless, FIU came out stronger in the second half.

The Golden Panthers (1-8) managed six shots, but were unable to get any of them past Hilltopper goalkeeper Melissa Bailey.

Freshman Jenna Silverberg broke the scoreless tie in the 79th minute when she floated a shot over FIU goalkeeper Juliana Gomez's head for the lead.

Janet Ligouri, Carmen Lopez and Tamara Kochen combined for four shots on goal in the game to lead FIU, but none were able to convert their chances.

Headline: Women's volleyball sweeps away South Alabama
Subheadline: Sophomore Vogel makes Jaguars pay; Doan, Fundora also contribute
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The plan for head volleyball coach Cookie Stevens was simple heading into FIU's game against South Alabama; walk into the Jaguar Gym and dominate the 3-12 Jaguars.

It didn't take long for Stevens' players to respond to their coach's wishes.

The Golden Panthers, led by sophomore Laura Vogel, won for the second consecutive match, defeating South Alabama 3-0 in Mobile, Ala. on Oct. 4.

Vogel, making a rare starting appearance, tallied a career-high eight kills and a .700 attack percentage to spark the surging Panthers.

"We felt with our history with South Alabama and the way we have been playing that we could let everyone contribute and not lose too much," Stevens said of the lineup change. "We dominated them pretty well so I decided to let Laura play."

Vogel made her coach look like a genius.

"I was very excited and I just wanted to show my coach, teammates and myself what I can do," Vogel said. "I think [the lineup change] kind of changed things around and gave us something else to work with."

FIU (10-5) was also led by seniors Julie Doan and Adriana Fundora. 

Doan recorded ten kills and a match-high seven blocks in the all-important conference road game.

"Julie is the glue that keeps us together," Stevens said.

Said Doan: "South Alabama is in our conference and we had to win because we only play them once so we knew we weren't going to get another chance at them."

Fundora was also all over the boxscore as usual, with her 10th double-double of the season, finishing with 12 kills and 12 digs.

Another senior, Debra Amundson continued her hot play, recording double-digit digs (13) for the fifth consecutive game.

FIU jumped out to a quick start in the first set, winning 30-21. Vogel was a perfect four-for-four attacking in the game while Doan also contributed four kills without an error. Amundson tallied nine digs in the opening set.

The seniors took control of game two, with Fundora and Doan combining for 10 kills in the set. Doan also had five blocks, helping the Golden Panthers to a 30-26 victory.

FIU hit .382 in the final set to finish off the Jags 30-15.

"We wanted to show our dominance and we were out to show that we were the better team," Stevens said.

FIU, 2-1 in Sun-Belt Conference play, next plays on the road against defending Sun-Belt Conference champion, Western-Kentucky on Oct. 10.

Headline: Football lets first win slip away
Subheadline: After amazing rally, FIU falters in final two minutes
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Before FIU began its second season of football, coach Don Strock figured wins would be tough to come by. Taking his schedule into account, the fourth-toughest in Division 1-AA, the second year coach knew that strides would not be measured by wins and losses.

Furthermore, improvement would be indicative solely on performance and not winning percentage. Playing teams like Georgia Southern, a six-time national champion and 13th-ranked team, FIU knew that things would not appear rosy in the win column.

But with about two and a half minutes to play Oct. 4 in Paulson Stadium, the Golden Panthers led perennial power GSU 35-31. FIU could have erased the painful memories etched in their minds from an 0-4 start amidst close losses, injuries and the suspension of key players, but instead caved in with 2:33 to go when Teddy Craft pulled in a 33-yard pass from Trey Hunter for the go-ahead score late in the game.

The Eagles held on, 37-35, after missing the point-after attempt.

Given GSU's past success and talent level, Strock - who usually does not award moral victories - felt his team passed what may very well have served as a litmus test to chart FIU's progress five games into its second season.

"I'd say we passed," Strock told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel after the two-point loss. "I said this year isn't about wins and losses, it's how we compete."

FIU (0-5) never stopped challenging its opponent in a hostile environment after falling behind 28-7 in the second quarter. Redshirt freshman quarterback Josh Padrick erased his last first two starts with a record-setting performance before a crowd of 10,409.

Padrick, who was a combined 23-of-69 in his last two starts, completed 50 percent of his passes for a school-record 370 yards and three touchdowns. The Merritt Island native threw just one interception.

FIU turned to their "four-minute" offense to rally back from a 21-point deficit. The Golden Panthers scored three touchdowns in a 12-minute span in the second and third quarters. The final score in the comeback, a one-yard run by fullback Adam Gorman, knotted the score at 28-28 with 4:28 left in the third quarter.

"We played hard. Some of the guys played nicked up and hurt, but we're playing an away game in somebody else's stadium. I tip my hat to them. I'm proud of them," Strock said. 

"We played hard in a hostile situation against a team that has played for a lot of national championships and we had a legitimate chance at winning the football game. But we're not sound enough in all areas.

"[Saturday night] was bittersweet. We feel we should have won this football game. I know everybody in that locker room does, including me. We let it get away and we're just letting too many get away," Strock added.

FIU, whose notion of experience consists of redshirt sophomores, took the lead with 4:29 left in the final quarter on what proved to be only a small portion the yardage receiver Harold Leath amassed in FIU's defeat. 

The sophomore split end caught eight passes for  school record 192 yards. The 60-yard score that gave FIU a four-point lead, 35-31, was his longest on the day.

Despite rallying from a three-touchdown hole and committing far lass penalties than they did at the start of the season, FIU can look upon miscues throughout the game that may signify the difference between victory and defeat.

Among them, a blocked 23-yard field goal attempt in the fourth quarter, an onside kick that slipped through the grasp of two FIU specialists and a roughing-the-kicker penalty that resulted in a GSU touchdown in the second quarter.

"We just have to correct the little things and we'll be right there," Padrick told the Miami Herald.

FIU's defense, which has been shaky at times this year, failed to hold the Eagles in the fourth quarter after the go-ahead score by Leath. The Golden Panthers allowed 544 yards of total offense. FIU gained 461. 

After trailing 14-0 in the first quarter, FIU was led by quarterback David Tabor on a seven play scoring drive that ended with a three-yard touchdown pass to receiver Cory McKinney. 

GSU answered with two consecutive scores of their own before FIU went into its "four-minute" offense to cover the 21-point discrepancy.

Slot receiver Chandler Williams had seven receptions for 108 yards including one touchdown in the third quarter.

In addition to his one-yard score, Gorman caught an 11-yard pass for a touchdown as well.

Headline: EDITORIAL: Colombian referendum forum provided important opportunity for local Colombians
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The Colombian Studies Institute and the Colombian Student Association did a service to the local Colombian community by holding a forum on the Colombian constitutional referendum on campus Oct.3.

The referendum, which is endorsed by Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, is a set of complex articles that address issues such as changing the size of Congress, restricting the behavior of congressional members, cutting public expenditures for salaries and pensions, and setting aside public funds for education and public pensions. 

The document is clouded with political jargon and technicalities that make it very difficult for the average person to understand. And some people are afraid that this obscurity might influence voters to choose a blanket yes or blanket no option rather than examining each question and voting one by one. 

Consequently, CSI and COLSA decided to summarize the articles and present them to the audience in a clear-cut form. They also invited three members of the Colombian Congress, two who are for the referendum and one against, to speak at the forum, thus presenting a balanced perspective on the issue.

With more than 75,000 Colombians, of whom more than 35,000 are registered to vote in homeland elections, residing in Miami-Dade and Broward counties (according to The Miami Herald), it is important that they remain educated about issues affecting Colombia and are given a chance to participate in major political decisions, such as those contained in this referendum.   And with only a 25 percent vote needed to determine the passage of the referendum, the voting turnout among local Colombians could significantly affect the outcome.

Thanks to this event, local Colombian voters, including some FIU students,  have been afforded an opportunity to have a say in the future of their home country, a future which is, in the least, uncertain.

Headline: Potential law may threaten students' jobs
Author: Maria Merzeau /Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The ongoing legal battle between the Federal Trade Commission and telemarketers over the national "do not call" list has many telemarketers, some of which are students, worried. 

Thanks to the national "do not call" list, Americans are able to block most telemarketing calls. 

But, the list exempts calls from political parties, charity organizations, or religious groups.  

Since the FTC opened to the do not call list program to the public in late June, over 50 million phone numbers have registered. 

According to the Federal Communications Commission, telemarketers could face fines of up to $11,000 per call, if they call listed phone numbers. 

Many telemarketing companies hire students. Iracema Rodriguez, an MDC graduate, 24, worked in telemarketing one year ago for Worldcom, a company that once sold cellular phones and natural weight loss products and went into bankruptcy in 2002. She worked at the company for one year.

''Most of the people in telemarketing don't work more than six hours a day, I worked five hours a day with a total of 20 hours per week. In the company that I worked for, [there] were only four employees,'' Rodriguez said.                      

Rodriguez, who would also work every other Saturday, said she was paid $6 per hour plus sales commissions.  

For her it was good to work only 20 hours per week, because that way she was able to combine it with college. 

Since Worldcom also did commercial advertising, she would call people to sell products, relying on a list composed of people who called after watching a Worldcom commercial. 

''I really liked the job, '' Rodriguez said. 

But not all students like telemarketing. Gissel Garcia, 24, an FIU senior and education major worked seven years ago at a telemarketing company that sold office supplies. 

She worked four hours a day, 20 hours a week, and because she was a high school student at the time, she earned minimum wage plus commission. 

'I did not like telemarketing that much, and I would not work in telemarketing again," Garcia said. "I didn't like the fact of calling people and only [thinking of] selling the product. But I think that many people that work in telemarketing are probably going to lose their jobs, because of the 'do not call list.''' 

FIU student Travis Ramsey, a marketing major, worked last fall for a month at a telemarketing company called Sunshine Surveys, which conducts surveys on political candidates in the Midwest. 

''We would do the survey poll for a political candidate,'' Ramsey said. 

Ramsey worked part time, four hours a day, 20 hours a week while he was going to FIU. 

''We did not sell, we would call people and ask them questions to see what political candidates they prefer, in order to do a poll,'' Ramsey said.

Ramsey had a mixed experience. 

"Telemarketing is good, because you learn good phone skills, but for marketing [the] experience is minimum," he said. 

Some people are worried that the list would endanger their jobs. 

Leydis Ugalde, 30, works as an insurance clerk in an Allstate Agency. 

Even though the list is on hold, her agency complies with the FTC and is still respecting the list in the meantime. 

Ugalde checks if the number is on the do not call registry before calling.

In the agency there were two more workers who exclusively did telemarketing and because of a lack of telemarketing work, those people were laid off. So, Ugalde is now the only one who handles telemarketing in that office. 

'We usually call people and offer them a price on their car insurance, to see if they want to change to Allstate,'' Ugalde said. '' I think that the 'do not call list' is going to affect our telemarketing even more, because now there are more people that do not want to be called, and since the list has gone into effect, I have less telemarketing work.''

But other companies, like Dreamtime Tours International, are in favor of the list. 

Dreamtime Tours, a company located in Fort Lauderdale that sells vacation packages on cruises, rent a cars and hotels,  is a medium-sized company. 

It is  compromised of 60 employees, which conduct telemarketing within the United States and beyond. 

The employees get paid by the hour, plus commissions, depending on how much they sell. 

'We do a lot of telephone sales, and since I downloaded the [national 'do not call'] list on Sept. 12 in order to do the telemarketing, we blocked those phone numbers,'' said Charles Cummings, the general manager. Cummings respects the list although it is still on hold.

Before the do not call list, the company still had to follow Florida's do not call list, according to Cummings. 

Florida's do not call list started in 1991 and it has 170,000 numbers registered. 

The numbers in the Florida list get added automatically to the national do not call list.

'I think that anybody who doesn't want to be called should be on the 'do not call list."  Cummings said.

Headline: Forum educates about changes to Colombian constitution
Author: Carolina Sarasssa/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On Oct. 3, FIU became the place for a forum held to educate the local Colombian community about possible changes to the Colombian constitution. 

"The referendum is an opportunity to change the country," said Gina Parady, member of the Colombian Congress,  at the forum, which was held in the MARC building in Spanish.

Colombia Sen. Carlos Gaviria Diaz of the Frente Social political party, Sen. Andres Gonzalez Diaz of the Liberal Party, and House Representative Parady of the Liberal Party spoke at the forum.

The jurisdictional language in which this referendum was written is very complex to understand for a standard citizen seeking representation. The Colombian Student Association (COLSA) found this a problem. As a result, COLSA, along with the Colombian Studies Institute, decided to summarize every article and make it readable for common citizens. 

"We opened this place to explain [the changes to] the community in a simple language," COLSA President Alejandra Henao said.

The referendum was divided into three parts according to topic: Congress, public corporations and political parties; public spending; and social spending. 

The referendum aims to fight corruption and favoritism in politics, cut government spending and improve education. 

"We want to recuperate the Colombian's trust for the government," said Gonzalez Diaz. 

He explained that Colombia is in a deficit and now finds itself in great debt. 

"We owe more than half of what we have," Gonzalez Diaz said. 

Colombia needs to make adjusting decisions in public spending as soon as possible, according to Gonzalez Diaz. Approximately 700,000 children cannot study because there are not sufficient funds. These funds could be taken from this governmental spending cut, he said. 

"We want to guarantee our citizens with our support," Gonzalez Diaz added.

This event is very important for the Colombians living in the United States because it gave them the opportunity to make a choice, as they can still vote on the referendum via an absentee ballot.

"Colombians living in the exterior can look at these problems with an objective view," said Victor Uribe, associate professor of history and law, director of The Colombian Studies Institute at FIU's Latin American and Carribean Center, and organizer of the event in company with COLSA. 

The referendum contains fifteen articles to reform the Colombian Constitution. These changes will be passed depending on the vote of its citizens on Oct. 25. 

The first part of the referendum basically intends to ban corruption in the Congress, public corporations and political parties. It states that those public officials condemned with charges against the government should resign and will not be able to postulate for other political positions. The Congress should only engage in its legislative powers, but not in administrative functions. Also, the size of Congress should be reduced. Currently, the number of members of Congress changes as the size of the population changes.

"As today, we [have] 268 members of Congress, but after the next census, we will have 490 members," said Parody. "It is too much, and we should freeze it at this point." 

The second point discussed at the forum was public spending. The referendum restricts public pensions to no more than 25 minimum salaries per month. This public budget should be defined in part, through public audiences and participations of Congress. 

Gaviria Diaz argued against the referendum. He said that it will give Congress more power in public spending, and reduce representation by reducing the size of Congress. Colombia has enough laws; it does not need any more, said Gaviria Diaz. 

The last point is social spending. The cut in governmental spending should be invested in education, better water, pensions and waste treatment, according to the referendum.

If all these changes are made, they will start taking place in the year 2007. The senators that were present at the forum said because Colombia is a democratic country, they want that to be effective and every Colombian vote to be counted.

Colombians who attended the event appreciated the opportunity to learn more about the referendum.

"I am here because I am concerned about the future of my country," said Leticia Gaviria, an audience member.

"I agree with all the changes that this referendum is proposing," Monica Prado, a sophomore and political science major, said.

FIU President Modesto Maidique was glad that this event was accessible to members of the FIU community, including Colombian students.

 "One of the important roles of the university is to provide opportunities to a forum for different views," Maidique said. "You need a convergence of ideas to get to the truth."

At the end of the presentation of this referendum, the forum was opened for questions and concerns of the audience. They got a chance to clarify any doubts about these possible changes affecting their representation.

Other associations that attended this forum were CASA (Colombian American Service Association), Centro Comunitario de Las Americas, and Kiwanis, among others.

Headline: Shalala stresses importance of unity
Author: Yudy Pineiro/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In a speech entitled "Public and Private Higher Education:  Diverging or Converging" University of Miami President Donna E. Shalala stressed the importance of the cooperation among research universities in order to serve the community in areas such as public health.

Shalala presented her speech at the Faculty Convocation and Awards Ceremony at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center on Oct. 3, where 28 professors were honored for research, teaching, scholarship and service.

   "I don't see us in competition.  I believe that great cities have great universities," said Shalala.

   FIU President Modesto A. Maidique's opening remarks, included an expression of gratitude for Shalala's presence at the convocation and his hopes that one day the two football teams will play each other.

"There is no better football team west of the Palmetto,"said Maidique.

Opening remarks were also presented by Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of Academic Affairs, Marcel Escoffier and Adolfo Henriques, chairman of the FIU Board of Trustees.

"A wonderful marriage between our institutions has already begun," said Henriques about the relationship between FIU and UM.

Then they presented the faculty awards and the FIU Council of 100 award.

"I thought gratitude was too weak a word," said Steve Mintz, FIU Physics professor and winner of the $10,000 Council of 100 award. After the awards were presented, it had come time for Maidique to present the speaker he had been teasing all morning, Shalala.

"First of all when I heard that Donna Shalala was going to be the next president of our sister university [and] across town neighbor, which is of course the University of Miami, I was delighted.  I was delighted because I knew her and more so I knew of her and I knew what an outstanding leader she would make for our community and for our state," began Maidique.

Shalala has held tenured professorships at Columbia University, the City University of New York (CUNY) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

She was president of Hunter College of CUNY for seven years until 1987 and Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison for six years. 

Shalala has also served political roles under President Jimmy Carter's administration as Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research and under President Bill Clinton as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

"We share your pain and both our needs to tighten our belts," said Shalala. "All of higher education is feeling the pain - a downturn has hit all of us whether we are young or old in higher education."

Her speech focused on the similarities between the two institutions: research, and its importance in social issues. Shalala believes a good research university is built with time.

"Patience and discipline is how you build a great research university.  There's a wonderful story about how you get to Carnegie Hall, 'Practice, Practice, Practice,'; The way you build a great research university is with, 'Patience, Patience, Patience,'; and a lot of 'Discipline, Discipline, Discipline,'" said Shalala.

Shalala discussed FIU as a research university and said, "I believe that newer research universities need newer roles."

Some of these roles Shalala said were critical. Shalala said that there are so many social problems within our community, and as a society and as a university we must help solve these problems.  

"We must find ways to deliver adequate prenatal and postnatal care for teen mothers, and developmental screenings for babies at risk.  We must find ways to educate disadvantaged parents and immigrant parents, and often children themselves to the facts about health and nutrition," Shalala said.

Most administrators received the speech warmly. "I think [Shalala] did an excellent job in pointing out the critical role that university-based research plays in solving social ills," said Rosenberg. 

"I feel that she downplayed the differences between public and private universities," commented Howard B. Rock, former faculty senate chair, history professor and service award recipient.

Shalala also touched on the future relationship of the two universities.

"We are creating a new paradigm.  Research universities like Miami and FIU must begin to tear down these barriers and build bridges and partners."

Headline: Radiohead show leaves indelible memories
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
"And on the 8th Day, God created Thom Yorke," read a bumper sticker on the back of the car I saw as I was leaving the Radiohead concert  Oct. 4. 

That should give you some idea of what this music does to its fans. Perhaps one of the most versatile groups in the past decade, these British geniuses have seen their popularity skyrocket a little higher with each album they release, each one pushing their creative limits and setting new standards. 

A kind of Pink Floyd of our generation, they have single-handedly invented a sound so distinct that other bands fall into a "Radiohead-like" category, a-la Coldplay, Muse and Sigur Rós. 

It's refreshing to see Radiohead touring parts of the United States such as South Florida. 

For several years now, they concentrated on touring mostly in Europe, only visiting American metropolises like New York and Los Angeles. 

How can I even begin to describe their performance that evening. After a nice, rocking opening act by fellow Englishmen Supergrass, Radiohead ominously took the stage, shrouded in complete darkness. 

This band has such a way of doing things, it's hard not to smile, feel happiness, clap, scream or do anything else that people at concerts do. They have developed a method that completely redefines the live performance.

Opening with "2+2=5," they played an impressive repertoire with several other songs from their latest album, Hail To The Thief, like "Sit Down, Stand Up" and "Sail to the Moon," along with classics like "Airbag," "Paranoid Android," "Lucky," "Idioteque," "Morning Bell," "National Anthem," "The Bends," "Street Spirit" and even the b-side,"Talk Show Host." There wasn't a moment I wasn't moving to the music. They play so powerfully that it's almost impossible to direct your attention elsewhere. 

I admire this ability Radiohead has for drawing an audience of 30,000 or so in and keeping them locked and fixed for more than two hours.

Yorke and the gang never play the same song twice, in other words, the live versions of these songs are given a new breath of life with varied elements added here and there. They do an excellent job of spicing up their songs for an electrifying performance on stage.

The stage performance was incredible. Radiohead always brings this gigantic set of lights with them when they tour, you'll see it in pictures. 

Twice I've seen that thing in action and it never ceases to amaze me and my eyes. Vibrant colors and flashing lights pulsate, bringing the music to life.

 Yorke's dance moves are also an important part of their stage presence, it's like his little trademark. I think he should invent an exercise video and call it Thom Yorke-size. 

He bounces and hops around the stage, twists his body and motions with his arms and hands - quite a sight to see. One gets a great sense of his friendliness and British hospitality with his cute little quirks like that. 

There was one moment  during the show which particularly drove the crowd, and myself, mad with laughter. 

On each side of the stage were large, thin projection sheets which displayed video feed of the stage. 

During the song "You and Whose Army?" from Amnesiac, Yorke sat and played at a piano that had a small camera attached to it. He snuggled his face up to the camera, looked right into the lens, and sang, motioning with his hands to the lyrics: "Come on, come on, you think you drive me crazy." Hilariously admirable.

After two encores, Radiohead departed, trickling off stage one by one. 

As the band said their goodbyes, the lights behind them spelled out in capital letters "FOREVER" which scrolled across the screen as the show finished up. 

I can only guess and hope that this means they will be doing this sort of thing forever. It's only my second time seeing Radiohead live and I'm already wondering when will be the next. 

I realized why so many have fallen under their spell. After an evening spent with them playing a show like that, I can't imagine who, how and why anybody would not like Radiohead. 

Well, OK, that's an exaggeration, but I have a hard time believing someone could have anything less than a good time at a show of this caliber. The musical orgasm you feel is addicting. 

For now, I'll wait patiently and make sure I have another $50 set aside when the time comes once again. 

For the moment, I feel aptly satisfied and can now resume life with the pleasant memories from Saturday night stirring around in my head.

Subheadline: Vertical Horizon: Couldn't evade the sophomore stink
Author: Robert J. Gramatges / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Anyone looking for upbeat/bittersweet need look no further than Vertical Horizon. Go, their followup to '99s Everything You Want, maintains their pop/rock style infused with borderline melancholic lyrics. 

The band considers this sophomore album as a step forward in terms of subject matter. Musically, however, it seems to have taken them two steps back. 

With simple assembly-line-rock melodies and less ambitious production, Go fails to capture the clever charm of its predecessor.

In the sea of cookie cutter tracks, "Won't Go Away" swims. Though not lyrically as strong as others, the song brings out the best character of the band - that wounded lover still aching over a lost love.

"I'm Still Here," the first single off the album, is unfortunately not up to par. It seems more put together than well-written. 

It combines some good elements but the concoction does not hack it musically.

The repetitious choruses and unadventurous lyrics take the album to a more generic place. 

Also, pretty violins take precedence over the subtle electronic undertones that VH is known for. 

Though most of the album contains inedible words, "One of You" offers something to digest. 

This song is pop poetic, its words simple yet elegant. This song is lyrically the only step forward for the band. 

Go is Vertical Horizon less stimulating and equally humdrum. The album does not "go" far creatively. 

The sound is a cross between Shania Train and Matchbox Twenty with lyrics that mostly resemble those of Twain and sometimes the Vertical Horizon of four years ago. 

In essence, the album is stomach-able. However, it leaves fans hanging in terms of expectations. The sophomore stink seems to have grabbed this album.

Subheadline: "School of Rock": You'll be playing air guitar all the way home
Author: Cyntianna Ledesma / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Jack Black (known for such movies as "High Fidelity," "Shallow Hal" and "Saving Silverman") usually seems like he is trying too hard to get people to laugh. His crazy antics can come across as stupid, rather than funny, but finally, he has found our funny bones, and hit the spot.The rent is due, but Dewey Finn's (Jack Black) band hasn't hit the big time yet. 

With Battle of the Bands just around the corner, Dewey thinks this will be his chance to shine in the lime light and bring home a big cash prize. 

Only problem is, his band mates have voted him out. Stuck without a job, or a band, Dewey decides to impersonate a highly-recommended substitute teacher at a prestigious elementary school.

After seeing the students play in their music class, Dewey gets an idea to teach the children about rock and roll, form a band with them, and play at Battle of the Bands. He tells the students it's a secret school project, and turns them all into serious punk rockers.

Each kid in the class gets to be part of the band. There's a lead guitarist, a drummer, keyboardist, bass player, back-up singers, head of security and, of course, groupies. 

Even the principal, Ms. Mullins (Joan Cusack), is touched by Dewey's rock and roll, dropping her uptight façade when he invites her out for a drink.

If you think this movie seems predictable, you're wrong. Though the plot may seem simple and over-used, Jack Black delivers the laughs when you least expect it. 

And if you're a rock fan, you'll enjoy this movie even more because it has an amazing soundtrack full of legendary rockers including The Who, Led Zepplin, Stevie Nicks, The Doors and The Ramones.

The 88 minutes of this movie seem to fly by as you tap your toes to the sounds of electric guitars, drums and basses. 

You will leave this movie feeling like you just left a rock concert, playing air guitar all the way home.

Subheadline: FIU professors create photographic essay on native Mexican homes
Author: By Isis Iglesias / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Eduardo del Valle and Mirta Gomez del Valle have devoted their lives to art: teaching it and making it.  

This week marks the debut of their first book, "From the Ground Up," a photographic essay that documents dwellings built in the Yucatan Peninsula and that also explores the meaning of home. 

The husband and wife team has been in the visual arts department at FIU since 1983. Working together in what they call a 'co-active collaboration,' the couple have, over the years, taught hundreds of classes while still maintaining and expanding their photographic career. 

Well-known for photographing subjects in a state of flux, their work is in the permanent collection of such institutions as the Museum of Modern Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.  

They are the recipients of Guggenheim, Cintas and NEA fellowships in photography. 

Despite all the accolades and glory, the pair is simply known as 'Ed and Mirta' to their students, and one is rarely seen around the Biscayne Bay Campus without the other.  

In fact, they even teach their classes together. "We've been together every day since 1970," said  del Valle, "Every day we teach together.  Students don't really make the distinction; they see Ed and Mirta, but they don't realize we're two.  They really see us as one. It's an incredible advantage for them. In every class we are there. We teach five classes a semester; in all five classes we co-teach every class."

Besides being an incredible learning experience for the students, the relationship serves to inspire and sets high standards for their own work. 

"We learn from each other. She's my favorite teacher and the other way around too," said del Valle.  

The couple is further unified by their uncompromising dedication to each other and the artwork they produce collectively; they don't feel the need to make distinctions. 

"We're not interested in who made what. This is truly, we call it, a co-active collaboration in which we blur the authorship to the point that you really can't tell. I've learned to take short pictures; she's learned to take tall pictures. You see we really can't tell and when we do we're not interested. She made this one. I made that one. So what! It just really doesn't matter who made it," explained del Valle.

The photographs which have culminated in the new book reach back to their first visit to the Yucatan in Mexico in the early `80s. 

Gomez del Valle explained how the project came to be, "It's not a question that we picked something, it's sort of like the place picked us.  We went there on a visit, a vacation, and we just fell in love with the location. It sparked some really strange memories of our own childhood basically because the capital of Yucatan, Merida, was founded basically around the same time as Havana and so the architecture was really striking and then once we ventured out into the countryside, the homes were sort of like reminiscent, we just fell in love with the place and there was something for us to build on. So we just kept going back, gathering material and photographing."

They were fascinated by rural towns where some of the people still spoke Mayan and lived in indigenous houses.  

 "What's most astonishing is that the basic design of the house has survived over 2,000 years; the only difference is the substitution of materials," explained Gomez del Valle. 

Del Valle explained that these dwellings struck a chord in them, they identified with their forms in a fundamental way and it led to an exploration of what a home represents.  "As first generation immigrants, if you don't transform and evolve you become extinct, and that is what these houses have gone through. These pictures, in a way, they're almost like self-portraits. I mean once you're a transplant, you have to evolve and transform and adapt and appropriate. That's what these houses do. These houses had to change because these materials, they don't make them anymore." 

"We were also told by locals, 'Boy, aren't we lucky they are photographing these things, because we don't make them anymore like this. We just can't afford to make these homes.' They are really something," said del Valle. 

Gomez del Valle describes their Yucatan photographs as an ongoing project that isn't going to end with the book. Their fascination with the area continues and she says, "I think this will be a life's work."   

About the book itself she explained, "But the fun thing was trying to make sense out of all the material. Because now you have thousands and thousands of photographs ... what does it all mean? What are you going to do with it? That was the fun part gathering the ones that were substantial and indicating what we intended in a photographic sense. So that's why the book is divided into three sections, three parts. The first part of the book is basically the original Maya architecture, it focuses on that evolution. The second part of the book introduces the influence of Spanish architecture on the ancient Maya architecture."

"The third part is the memory of home. How one commemorates or tries to remember a home, or anything for that matter, and the various forms that can take, from a child's drawing or rendering to a very elaborate sculpture frieze on an ancient Maya city. There is that sort of poetic sense in part three of the book," says Gomez del Valle. 

"The last picture is home plate.  We are baseball fans so we figured part one, two, three and then you get home. Right next to it is a Richard Rodriguez essay. It's stunning, he ends up calling it an 'American Homecoming', it's really a beautiful essay," says del Valle. 

"From the Ground Up" is being published by Nazraeli Press, makers of fine art books, and it includes 82 four-color plates as well as two essays: one by renowned writer Richard Rodriguez and the second by Sandra S. Phillips, senior curator of photography at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.  

Like a proud parent, del Valle beams when he says, "It's the most beautifully printed book I have ever seen and of course you're going to say every mom and dad says that their kid is special."   

The book is universal in its scope as well as personal in its details, "We covered the book in plastic, like Cuban furniture.  

The first sofa I slept in had plastic in New Jersey, 1960, and I slept in plastic, so why not cover the first book in plastic?" says del Valle with a laugh. 

His co-conspirator smiles too and adds mysteriously, "But there is also a book connection why the book was covered in plastic and it has to do with the last photograph in the book." 

Mirta Gomez del Valle and Eduardo del Valle will be unveiling their new book and giving a slide presentation of their work at Books and Books in Coral Gables on Friday Oct. 10 at 8 p.m.  

For more information call (305) 442-4408. The book can also be ordered through Nazraeli Press at www.nazraeli.com

If Andy Diaz was trying to show his superiority over extra-chromosome right-wing critics like Drew Mallo, it was, as he mentioned in his column, no great feat.  

Maybe he'd just run out of fresh ideas and needed an easy way to make his deadline, but the personal insults to Mallo demonstrate the very weakness that Diaz assailed his opponent for, even questioning his IQ and (practically) his parentage. (Ironically, if it is ignorance and ungrammatical writing he is concerned about, Diaz need look no further than the front page of this rag.)

In the course of accusing Mallo of ignorance, hate and intolerance, our crusading journalist illustrates his own ignorance, hatefulness and intolerance. His column was, to borrow a term from the liberal lexicon, "mean-spirited," not to mention ineffective.  Of course, any criticism of the liberal orthodoxy is instantly denounced by the left as mean, stupid, and intolerant, thus relieving liberals of the burden of actual debate.

Oh, it's not as though liberals are flower children utterly bereft of hatred-I find it especially pathetic that if there were no George W. Bush to kick around the Beacon would have no editorial page to speak of.  Not only is this "mean-spirited" but useless, and I think most of us who read this poor excuse for a newspaper have learned to tune out week after week of these pot shots at the president. Not that the Beacon is above hypocrisy, for I'm sure if we could dig up back issues from a few years ago, we would see numerous references to "Clinton-bashing."

If Diaz is eager to attack Mallo for being irrational, let's see what passes for logical debate with him (besides setting up a straw man and bravely knocking him down.)  

We learn that Bush should have been able to look through his crystal ball and predict 9/11--never mind that You-Know Who had been in power for eight years before the attacks and that this country had been blissfully out to lunch during that period, reaping the bogus benefits of the post Cold-War "Peace Dividend."  Never mind that our former(thank God) chief executive's idea of military operations included bombing aspirin factories in Sudan.  Indeed, this most likely would have been the response of a president Gore, who by the way, expressed relief that he was not in office at the time of the attacks-if you need further proof of the paucity of ideas of the political left, this is it. Sure, the Bush administration's response to 9/11 leaves much to be desired, but it is safe to say that had there been a president Gore, there most certainly would have been no War on Terror.  

It's amazing that Diaz feels justified in bashing Mallo with personal insults (although calling your opponent stupid is standard operating procedure in the liberal play book.)  It is revealing of the mindset of the political left that if you disagree with them you are not simply wrong or even just stupid, but evil, as our aspiring Al Franken points out in his last paragraph. You are a blight on humanity, which must be rescued by the self-anointed likes of Mr. Diaz.

Actually, I care nothing for his lack of insight and basic manners, I just think the FIU student body deserves so much better than the Beacon.

Dear Editor:

Your paper ought to be ashamed of itself for hiring the incompetent writer Andy Diaz. First of all, the grammatical errors found in my article are not even my fault--it is the editor's fault. The editor is supposed to check spelling and grammar--not the individual writer. That is what the editor's job is. And, Andy Diaz did not even address the content of my guest piece. My guest column was well-thought out. I made a case even though I did send a rough draft that contained misspellings. I make the case that Andy Diaz purposely had my article printed with typos and grammatic errors to make me look bad. And, once again, instead of fair criticisms and debate over the content of the column all I got was emotional rhetoric and attack. Well, Mr. Diaz, you made yourself look stupid.
