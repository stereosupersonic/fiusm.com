Headline: Interracial relationships enrich family culture
Author: Yasmine Abellard/ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
My experience with a cross-cultural relationship isn't necessarily a personal one, but more of a family affair. In my immediate and extended family, you could find cultures ranging from Haitian to Canadian, American, Jewish and Mexican. This combination of cultures never posed a threat to me, or my family members. In fact, they would often joke by placing bets on whether I would marry someone from my Haitian culture or a foreigner. 

Although my family welcomed other cultures, I wondered how others involved in cross-cultural relationships adjusted to a culture they were unfamiliar with. And so, I interviewed several students (and one professor) who told of their trials and triumphs, in stepping out of their ethnic comfort zone, and engaging in a foreign affair.

Dr. Chris Girard, an associate professor and graduate program director from the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, defines a cross-cultural relationship as, "[a] relationship between two people where they come from different nationalities, different ethnic identifications, or different religions or different races." 

Despite these differences, Dr. Girard says, "differences do not need to be viewed as problem, they can be a strength."

Marra Chinn, a senior and advertising major, describes her cross-cultural experience with her boyfriend who is Guyanese. Chinn's boyfriend knew that her Chinese-American background would make no difference with his family. Chinn says, "On the other hand, my side of the family I knew would be a totally different story." 

Chinn who describes her family as being somewhat traditional, admitted that her mother was shocked at first when she brought her boyfriend home. But in the end, Chinn happily says, "my whole family likes him, they think he's the greatest guy."

Although language or religion didn't prove to be barriers in the relationship, there were a few cultural differences Chinn says she had to accustom herself to when she met her boyfriend's family. Chinn learned to familiarize herself with Guyanese accents, spicy foods, and a double-kiss greeting, as opposed to the one kiss she was use to.

Regardless of differences, Chinn sees her relationship as an advantage. "Any element of somebody else's culture that you incorporate into your own just makes your life more fulfilling." 

Isalys Cespedes, a junior and journalism major, felt quite confident that her family would accept her Southern boyfriend and was more worried about how his family would react to their cross-cultural relationship. Coming from a Cuban-American family, Cespedes says, "I was more concerned with his family's reaction in the sense of how are they going to take to Hispanics, and how are they going to take to our food and our way of communicating with each other, and the language barrier." 

Much to her surprise, Cespedes was welcomed with open arms into the family. Although both families accepted each other, Cespedes took notice of the differences, particularly family interaction and the language barrier. 

She recalls a family gathering in which she says she experienced her first culture shock when meeting with her boyfriend's relatives who had not seen their nephew in several years. "The way that they greeted each other after having such a long time of not seeing each other surprised me. It was a very simple little hug. They don't show it the way Hispanics do. We're very affectionate; we hug and we kiss and we laugh and we joke; they're more reserved people."

Dr. Girard explains that, "people don't realize that each individual has their personal culture, and two individuals in a relationship are going to judge what the other does in many instances as being wrong." He adds that "cross-cultural couples are not really a difference in kind, but rather, degree."

Cespedes describes an issue common with some cross-cultural couples. "My grandparents coming from Cuba know a limited amount of English. His parents don't speak a word of Spanish, so all you really see is arms flaring!" Cespedes's boyfriend is learning a bit of Spanish, and she says that despite the language barrier, the families manage and they make it fun. 

After putting her fears behind her, Cespedes, who believes that her relationship with her boyfriend was truly a learning experience, says she understands why some would be afraid of involving themselves in a culture that is foreign to them. "I've learned and noticed that people are afraid of the unknown [and] what they don't understand."

For those who feel that differences in cultures may result in the loss of one's identity, or believe that performing a balancing act between two (or more) cultures will be too difficult, Dr. Girard says that "what couples need to focus on, is what they do share in common, and then when there are differences, what each can borrow from the other." He adds, "the potential for growth is immense."

Unfortunately for my family, I have yet to know which culture I will marry into. Perhaps it'll be my own, and perhaps not. It's nice to know that I could meet someone from the one hundred plus countries of the world, not knowing which culture will challenge me and introduce a new way of life, as well as possibly add to the ethnic m√©lange of my family.

While there are certain qualities I look for in someone, the place of birth, nation of citizenship, and ethnic origin isn't one of them.

Headline: College students adopt liberal views, lose spirit
Author: Hans Zeiger/ Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Fresh from his failed California gubernatorial campaign, pornographer Larry Flynt recently lectured at college campuses around the country as part of an effort by the American Civil Liberties Union to recruit students to join their lethal cause. In the past few weeks, Flynt has made celebrity appearances at Harvard University, the University of Miami and the University of California at Berkeley.

"Freedom of speech is not for the thought you love but for the thought you hate the most," Flynt declared to one audience. Hate speech is the appropriate label for the "musical" talents who joined Flynt on the ACLU's 2003 "College Freedom Tour."

Singers included the rapper Mystic, pop underground artists Phantom Planet, and black supremacist rappers Dead Prez whose top-40 lyrics include such un-edifying lines as "Turn this m__f_ing sh-up," "F_ the Bible," and "The only good cop is a dead cop ... Every police is a punk a_ b_." No wonder in the midst of the ACLU tour, members of Dead Prez were arrested for disorderly conduct and refusing to comply with New York police officers.

College Freedom Tour organizer and ACLU executive director Anthony Romero explained to the Christian Science Monitor, "this is an investment in future generations." 

At each campus, the ACLU displayed an MTV-style documentary glorifying the history of the ACLU and giving prideful attention to the ACLU's infamous 1978 defense of Nazi parade organizers in Skokie, Illinois. 

According to Romero, ACLU membership has grown by one third to 400,000 since 2001. Due to the ACLU's renewed focus on reaching out to Generation Y, an increasing number of members are young people whose zeal for leftist causes is cultivated by their professors and the anti-traditional culture.

In addition to the cultural influences that are working in a thousand directions to dissuade young people from the preservation of American order, the ACLU is doing everything it can to nurture the roots of a budding generation of radicals. "Freedom is why we're here," declares the College Freedom Tour Web site. Of course, for the ACLU, freedom is defined as the ability to do whatever one chooses. And as Larry Flynt would define freedom, it is the ability to do whatever one chooses that traditional civil society will "hate the most."

If freedom is in jeopardy, it is not the freedom to express the "thought you hate the most," that finds itself at risk. Instead, we are losing the freedom of the lovely and beautiful things whose greatest expression is not of the flesh, but of the spirit.

Both left and right warn of a general slackening of freedom. But I am not so concerned about a declension of freedom as I am worried about the dearth of moral duty that plagues the souls of a generation of Americans. 

I am not so despondent about the hyperbolized warnings about civil liberties and the right to choose and the right to a job and the right to education and the right to health care and so on; I am decidedly outraged by the culture of irresponsibility whose highest expressions are found in the vile raps of Dead Prez, the filthy smut of Larry Flynt, the noisome new doctrines of higher education and the quietly communistic agenda of the ACLU.

Only a people that is free in a perverted way can give such glory to the things of the flesh while neglecting the spiritual responsibility upon which true freedom depends. If it were true freedom for which we strived in our music, our education, our press and our courts, we would speak more freely of the things of the spirit.

We find ourselves free in the flesh and nearly enslaved in the spirit because we have failed to recognize both the source of our freedom and the imperative of our obligations. We have arrogantly assumed that we can forget God while receiving an infinite selection of blessings from some unknown source. 

America's college campuses are already awash in the false faith of ethical neutrality. The ACLU is exploiting the fields ripe for its harvest. 

Sadly, those of us who've been called to labor in the spiritual harvest are neglecting our duty, and a generation of Americans is growing up without a conscience, without the courage to fight the rampage of the left. 

Where are the preachers and teachers of honor and character on our college and university campuses to stand against the purveyors of hate who rule the culture? Clearly, it is time for a counter-revolution to revive our culture, to renew freedom in the spirit where it really matters.

Headline: Too-good-to-be-true relationships of good-looking celebrities, exactly that
Author: Lenore Skenazy
&nbsp;
Could it possibly be that the more beautiful you are, the more likely your mate will turn out to be a low-down, no-good, philandering cad who treats you like the fuzz on week-old tapioca pudding?

Consider these recent events: Halle Berry is splitting from her husband, Eric Benet, a serial cheater. 

Uma Thurman has done the same with her husband, Ethan Hawke, a sensitive artiste (you can tell by his goatee).

He supposedly has taken up with a 22-year-old he met at a restaurant. She was celebrating her birthday, he was humiliating his wife. Perfect match.

Jennifer Lopez, meantime, is in the less-than-jolly position of maybe being dumped by her maybe fiance who maybe cut loose - as we say in polite company - with a Canadian stripper.

What gives? Why do the guys with the biggest beauties seem to seek the most extracurricular booty?

Because life is fair.

Not fair in a good sense, mind you. Just fair in the sense that stars who seem to have everything really don't have much more than the rest of us. 

Except money, power and chefs for their pets, that is.

"Have you ever sat on a balcony and seen a beautiful view and then sat there for another 10 years and stopped noticing it?" asks Susan Perry, author of "Loving in Flow." That's what happens to the men married to gorgeous wives. 

"Novelty is what's arousing," she says, "not beauty per se."

Novelty also happens to be what is extremely available when you're a superstar. And that's who the world's most beautiful women usually end up with. Hunky skunks who other women are only too happy to flash their Victoria's Secrets at.

For a man to resist this smorgasbord, says Perry, "their character would have to be stronger than average. And no one ever said celebrities have stronger-than-average character."

But what about the fact that their wives - or fiancees or long-term girlfriends, as Liz Hurley was to Hugh Grant - are the very women most of the male population is busy licking posters of? 

Doesn't that excite the lucky hubs enough to make 'em think twice?

Apparently not. 

It could even make things worse. Like a drug addict who keeps taking bigger doses, a beauty addict married to, say, Nicole Kidman, could end up craving even finer flesh. These men are on such beauty overdrive that their minds (or some other vital organs) go nuts.

But just perhaps, suggests Jill Spiegel, author of "Flirting for Success," the fault lies not in the stars, male, but in the stars, female. 

"When you're a starlet who gets everything so easy, you crave a little challenge," Spiegel says. "That's why they're attracted to men with a bad boy edge to them."

Bottom line? Beautiful women + beautiful men = sad wrecks of lives. 

At least until they find other beautiful women and men. Then once again the helicopters hover and everyone toasts the radiant (if doomed) new couple.

Headline: Women's cross country finishes third at Sun Belt Conference Championships
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
The women's cross country team tied their best finish ever at the Sun Belt Conference Championships with a third place finish. The men's squad did not do as well, finishing in 10th place.

For the women, it marked the third time since 1998 that they finished in third place.

But host Western Kentucky stole the show, sweeping the men's and women's team titles. WKU's Bonita Paul won the women's 6,000-meter race (22:35.40) and Hilltopper Daniel Roberts claimed the men's 8,000-meter title in 26:10.84.

FIU senior Rebecca Rodriguez earned all-conference honors after finishing seventh in the 6,000-meter race in 22:35.40.

Freshman Amanda Howard was one of two other Golden Panthers to finish in the top 20 in the 6,000-meter, placing 17th in 25:02.72. Freshman Dalia Clarke finished in 19th with a time of 26:06.68.

Four more Golden Panther women rounded out the 6,000-meter field. Freshman Katherine Cardenas finished in 24th (25:39.05), freshman Daniela Sanchez in 36th (26:32.33), freshman Vanessa McKay in 47th (28:07.20) and senior Edda Santiago in 59th (31:03.85).

Jose Castro and Oscar Carballo were the top two FIU finishers on the men's all-freshman team. Castro finished 46th in 30:43.58 and Carballo ended up in 51st with a time of 30:56.74.

Dennis Gutierrez, Robert Castillo and Javier Diaz also competed for the FIU men's team, with all three finishing outside the top 50.

The FIU cross country team's next meet is on Nov. 15 at the NCAA South Regional.

Headline: Good news, then bad for men's soccer forward Plentz
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The good news didn't last very long for Fernando Plentz.

Just one day after being named Atlantic Soccer Conference Player of the Week, Plentz suffered a season-ending injury in practice on Oct. 28.

Plentz, a junior forward, broke his leg in two places while trying to execute a slide tackle. For Plentz, who was having his best season as a Golden Panther, the incident was very hard to handle. As he slid, one foot got caught in the grass and he felt a pop in his leg.

"It was devastating. The moment I felt the injury, I knew it was going to be bad. I felt too much pain. I knew I was going be out for the rest of the season and I just started crying," Plentz said.

The injury couldn't have come at a worse time for Plentz, who after sitting on the bench most of last season, was finally getting a chance to shine as a big part of the FIU scoring attack. 

"I was doing great this season...I was tied for the lead in scoring on the team, so it's really awful. It was one of the worst feelings I have ever had," Plentz said. "The team is doing great. We're having a great season, so it's really bad that I won't be able to play anymore this year."

Plentz, who was tied for the team lead in points (13) before the injury, had five goals on the season, with the most memorable one coming just four days before he got hurt. 

He drilled a game-winner in overtime against Adelphi to extend the 10th ranked men's soccer team's unbeaten streak to eight games.

"Last year, I didn't get to play much because it was my first year here, but during the spring and summer I worked really hard with the team to get better. And this year I was scoring big goals for the team and that goal against Adelphi gave me the Conference Player of the Week," Plentz said. "The week before I had another goal that gave us the tie [against Oneonta]. It felt really good, but the time the injury came was the worst time ever."

Despite having less than a full day to soak in the ASC award, Plentz was still very thankful for the honor.

"You feel really rewarded when you get something like that, but it's crazy how you can go from the top to the bottom in one day," Plentz said.

But Plentz did not go unnoticed by his teammates. 

Some of them wore shirts with Plentz's number under their jerseys during a 6-1 win over Philadelphia on Halloween night, as Plentz looked on from the sidelines, crutches and all.

"I know my teammates really cared about this injury. They wore shirts under their uniform for me. When Jared [Rose] scored a goal, he pulled his shirt up and he had written my number on his arm," Plentz said. "It shows that they care. I called him yesterday and thanked him and told him he has no idea how good it made me feel." Plentz added, "It made me feel wonderful when they did that. I can't explain how good it made me feel. That motivates me and it not only makes me stronger, but it makes [my teammates] stronger as well." 

And his teammates will have to be stronger, after already losing another key starter (Billy Boswell) in September.

"We still have a great team. The team doesn't die because I left. It can make them stronger, seeing that they can go far with the pieces that they have. We already lost a great player in the beginning of the year in Billy, so we know we can still go far even without the players we are supposed to have," Plentz said. 

FIU is currently 11-3-2, in first place in the Atlantic Soccer Conference and the team is 2-0 so far without Plentz.

"We have a great team, great guys, great individuals...Everybody cares about winning here and I know this team can go far," Plentz said. 

But as far as Plentz physically contributing to help the team win games, he will have to wait until next season.

Said Plentz: "I'll be in a cast for eight weeks. Then I'm going to rehab, so I should be back to play a little in the spring. I'm going to work even harder. But for next season, for sure I'll be back."

Headline: Volleyball loses two key games, faces must-win situation vs. New Orleans
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Nov. 1- WKU 3, FIU 0

The Golden Panthers were unable to avenge an earlier loss this season to Western Kentucky, getting swept 3-0 by the Hilltoppers for the second time this year at the Golden Panther Arena on Nov. 2.

The loss dropped FIU (11-12) under .500 for the first time this season. 

Jessica Jones and Jennifer Owens each recorded 13 kills for FIU, but it wasn't enough, as the Hilltoppers won three hard-fought sets, 30-26, 30-23 and 30-26.

"I thought we played hard, but they are a very good team. We stayed there and fought hard until the end...I was disappointed of course. I want to win and that's the bottom line, but we stayed there until the end," head coach Cookie Stevens said.

FIU has struggled of late after starting off the season 8-2. The team cruised through the early stages, but has had trouble with conference games.

"It goes back and forth. I think the early part of the season we were really fired up and I thought we were prepared for conference, but we just let a lot of close matches go," Stevens said.

This match was no different. FIU led 10-5, 6-1 and 12-6 in games one, two and three, but managed to blow the lead all three times.

"We just can't seem to finish," Stevens said.

Julie Doan had a team-high .474 hitting percentage and 10 kills for FIU, who fell to 3-7 in conference play.

Nov. 2- Middle Tenn. 3, FIU 2

FIU, fighting for a bid to earn a spot in the conference tournament, blew a 2-0 lead and fell to the Lady Raiders 3-2 at the Golden Panther Arena on Nov. 2.

The loss dropped FIU into an eighth place tie with New Orleans in the Sun Belt Conference and moved the Lady Raiders into seventh. The top eight teams in the Sun Belt earn berths into the tournament.

FIU won the opening two sets, but then lost three straight in the all-important game.

"We should have won the third or fourth one but just let go. We can't seem to finish it. Plain and simple, we have to finish it. We have to play hungry to win," Stevens said.

Adriana Fundora, who had been struggling of late, led FIU with 19 kills and 22 digs, her 14th double-double of the season.

"Adriana's been having a hard time on the outside. She's just had some bad luck, but she played pretty well today. Betsy set her a little differently and she has been a little more successful with that," head coach Cookie Stevens said.

Despite the loss, Stevens believes her team is still in good shape in the conference standings.

"I set out to be six-seven in the conference, but we're still right there. We don't have an overall dynamic player that is going to get us over the hump, so we need everybody to contribute every game," Stevens said.

But the next few games will decide FIU's fate, starting with a huge game against New Orleans on Nov. 8 that will most likely determine the eight seed in the tournament.

"These games coming up are very important. We are down to the wire with New Orleans and that's going to be the determining game most likely. So we have to come out ready to play," Stevens said.

Headline: How NOT To Call 911
Subheadline:  
Author: NikkiatUSM@aol.com
&nbsp;
Dear editor,

This semester, I have encountered a major safety concern on FIU's campus that, for some reason, has not been brought to anyone's attention.  I am a resident in the University Park Towers.  Two nights ago, I was woken up by a car alarm at 3:00 a.m.  At first, I thought this alarm was just another car alarm, as they go off constantly in the parking lot.  Yet upon looking out the window, I was shocked to see a car on fire. It was not a minor fire- there were flames coming out of the drivers' side window, and tons of smoke. Automatically, I reached for the phone to call emergency services.  To my dismay, I received a fast busy signal when I dialed 911.  So, I thought maybe I had to dial 7-911, as an on campus number. That didn't work either. So I tried 9-911, as an off campus number. This also resulted in a fast busy signal.  Meanwhile, I was looking out the window at a car burning, hoping that there was no one in the car because there was nothing I could do.  I tried all of the numbers I could think of, yet none of them would connect to emergency services. Finally, I jumped up and ran to my roommate's room, asking her if she knew the number. She has lived on campus for over two years, and yet had no idea what the number was.  After about 10 minutes of trying numerous arrangements of phone numbers, I was still unable to contact emergency services, but luckily, one cop car showed up and was able to quell the fire while waiting for a fire truck.

This was not my first problem with the emergency system, either. Earlier in the semester, I awoke to a screaming, frantic roommate, as another of our roommates had fainted and was lying motionless on the floor. Unable to call 911, my roommate had to leave the unconscious roommate with me in the room while she ran to the front desk to ask for help.  

Thankfully, there was no one in the car that burned while I was unable to call 911, and there was no one around the car to be injured either.  And thankfully, my roommate did not have anything seriously wrong with her that required immediate medical assistance.  Both cases could have become extremely serious, as in both cases I was unable to contact emergency personnel for assistance.

Since this recent incident, I have asked numerous people, both students and faculty, what number to call in case of an emergency. I have been told 911, 9-911, 2-911, 7-2911. One student told me that she thought the number was something other than 911 in order to prevent prank phone calls. A different phone number may prevent prank calls, but is it worth it if real emergencies cannot be reported? A faculty member I spoke to, who has worked at the university for over two years, said she has never seen the correct number posted, and did not know what it is. Another student said she called 7-2626, the campus emergency system, and was told to hang up and call 911. Yet she was not told the correct number to call either. 

I urge this university to consider the emergency procedures currently in place.  Whatever the emergency number the university chooses, it should be widely publicized and readily available to students and faculty. On campus, emergency numbers should be posted throughout residence halls and all other buildings.  At the previous university where I worked for 4 years, emergency numbers were affixed to the back of each residence hall room door, and resident assistants were responsible for posting the numbers in the hallways.  I was fortunate that neither of these emergencies resulted in a grave situation. I don't know if FIU will continue to be this fortunate without serious consideration of this issue.

Oh, and by the way, in case anyone was wondering, the true correct University Park on-campus emergency number if you are calling from a campus phone is 7-2911, if you are calling from your cell phone it is 305-348-2911.

CORAL GABLES
Car rams into tree, killing 2 passengers
By JENNIFER MOONEY AND SUSAN ANASAGASTI 
jmooney@herald.com

 Two people died and two others were hospitalized after an early morning crash Sunday in a Coral Gables neighborhood.

The accident, in the 3500 block of Alhambra Circle, happened shortly before 3 a.m. when the driver of a gray Honda Accord lost control of the car and crashed into a tree.

The group of college friends were on their way home to west Kendall from a night out in Coconut Grove, relatives say.

The driver of the car, Pedro Victorero, 26, and the front seat passenger, Margaret Pajak, 22, of St. Petersburg, were airlifted to Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Their conditions are unknown.

Donald Pernudi, Jr., 23, and Justin Dalziel, 23, who were riding in the back seat, died at the scene, police say.

For Pernudi, a Florida International University business student, whose family says he rarely went out, the night was intended to be a celebration for scoring a good grade on a test.

''He got a good grade on a test,'' his aunt Antonia Marshall said. ``He wanted to go out and celebrate.''

An investigation will determine the cause of the accident. However, police say that slick roads may have been a factor.

''It's standard in every case to see if drinking was involved where they were going to or coming from and if other vehicles were involved,'' said Sgt. Raul Pedroso, a Coral Gables Police spokesman.

&nbsp;
I'm sure everyone has seen the fliers all over campus. Yes, the "Hungry?" ones. And no, it's not an ad campaign for Snickers. It's the first annual Muslims Students Association Ramadan Fast-a-thon. What is Ramadan, you ask? What is a "Fast-a-Thon"? 

Ramadan is the Islamic holy month that is celebrated throughout the world by the global Muslim population which consists of 1.2 billion people. In Ramadan Muslims give up eating, drinking, and relations with one's spouse from sunrise to sunset. At sunset, Muslims gather as families and communities to break their fast with traditional meals from their mother countries or with good old American cuisines. 

Ramadan is a very special time for Muslims as its focus is based on submission, reflection and solidarity. It is also a time to remember those less fortunate who deal with the pain of hunger on a regular basis. The Ramadan Fast-a-Thon is being done in the spirit of remembering those who are less fortunate as the little we can do to help them.

It should be noted that hunger affects up to 24.7 million people in the U.S. alone, and this includes a high percentage of children. In the United States today, close to 8% of households are at risk of hunger, proving that hunger is not something that only happens "over there" in some far-off land, but it is happening right now in our very own country.

The Ramadan Fast-a-Thon is a national initiative to help the hungry and also bring a more clear understanding of Islam and its teachings. 

So how does the Fast-a-Thon work?

Members of the MSA have gone to local businesses in the area and have asked them to donate one dollar to the Daily Bread Food Bank (www.dailybread.org) for every non-Muslim who pledges to fast one day. That day will be November 20th, and at sunset (roughly 5:30 PM) we will all join together at Gracie's Barbeque Pit and break fast together with an assortment of traditional dishes from all around the Muslim world. 

So we ask you, are you willing to be hungry for a day so that someone else won't have to? If so, then please sign up at the MSA table by the GC Pit area. Look for the big "Hungry?" sign. We hope that the Ramadan Fast-a-Thon will serve as a model of Muslim and non-Muslim cooperation to affect positive change in our community.

Headline: Former FIU stars lead Jazz to opening day upset over Blazers
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
When Carlos Arroyo and Raja Bell used to dominate games, they usually did so wearing Golden Panthers' uniforms. 

Both had become journeymen since joining the NBA, but they might have finally found a home, back together as teammates - in Utah.

The combo of Arroyo and Bell combined for 34 points, leading the Utah Jazz to a 99-92 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers in their first game as NBA teammates on Oct. 29.

Arroyo, Utah's new starting point guard, also chipped in with a career-high 13 assists. Bell shot 7-of-11 off the bench and tied a career-high with 16 points.

Utah, known for years as Karl Malone and John Stockton's team, has taken on a youth movement this season, after Malone migrated to the Los Angeles Lakers and Stockton retired.

Last season, Arroyo was the third-string point guard, behind Stockton and Mark Jackson, and didn't get much of an opportunity to play.

Arroyo told Tim Buckley of the Deseret Morning News, "It was kind of sad, because I wanted to play, and I knew that being behind those two it was going to be tough. My mentality was, 'Here we have John and Mark; there's no way I'm gonna play here."

But it was not only Jackson's and Stockton's departure from the team that helped Arroyo step in. It was what Stockton told him before he retired.

"He thought I had the talent to play. But he said it's up to me to do it, to show I do. That kind of got in my head. I got myself motivated. Who better than him to say something like that to me? I appreciated it, and I was grateful to hear some words from him," Arroyo told Buckley. 

Stockton was obviously right.

Arroyo played a career-high 42 minutes and shot 7-of-13 from the field, pulling off a major upset at the Delta Center over a talented Portland bunch.

Bell, who signed as a free agent with the Jazz this summer, made a key basket for Utah late in the game to tie the game at 81. Bell spent last season as member of the Dallas Mavericks.

And Bell's successful Jazz debut against Portland was no fluke, as he scored 16 points again on 6-of-10 shooting in a 127-102 loss to Dallas on Nov. 1 in Utah's second game.

Arroyo missed the game with an ankle injury.

But once Arroyo is back to 100 percent, the NBA will have to keep its eye on this young Jazz team, led by two former Golden Panthers on the rise.

No longer is it Stockton to Malone. The Golden Panther connection of "Arroyo to Bell" is one of the new flavors in Utah.

Headline: Commentary: Nice win, but improvement still needed to beat Rajin' Cajuns
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Since their old-fashioned, bend-over-here-on-my-knee spanking at the hands of Stephen F. Austin on Oct. 9, FIU has been playing considerably better. They were embarrassed in their own stadium, on statewide television 35-13 by the Lumberjacks. SFA took their axes, sized up FIU and slowly chopped away to worsen the Panthers' record to 0-6. 

The Lumberjacks came into Community Stadium, with their second-string quarterback and made FIU look like one of the prep teams that play here on Thursday and Friday nights. 

At this point the season seemed to be over. Given the injuries this team had already sustained and the indefinite suspensions that were starting to unfold, the apocalypse seemed as evident as high humidity on a 95-degree Miami afternoon. Strock was cranky (can't blame him). The players down (understandably so). 

The game, in and of itself was horrendous, atrocious, any way you want to look at it. FIU rushed for 58 yards while allowing 337. Quarterback Josh Padrick completed just 43 percent of his passes. 

You figured that things should start looking up right around here. A 3-3 (at the time) Stephen F. Austin team coming into FIU's home after the Panthers came 2:33 and two points away from beating the "Miami" of Division I-AA, Georgia Southern. But things were far from being peachy once the clock displayed all zeros at the conclusion of that Thursday night marathon, which seemed like one too many bad episodes of MTV's Real World. 

Only this lengthy edition was actually genuine. 

Strock was dejected. Padrick and the offense were clueless. The defense was hurting, lacking key personnel and struggling to stop much of anything. 

What about the morale of the team that consists mainly of veteran redshirt sophomores?

It was fine, depending on whom you ask. For the most part it appeared to be doing alright. As well as it could be doing when you are winless in your first six tries. 

But then something inside this team clicked. A combination of playing their first division I-A opponent in Troy State and the fact the Trojans had denounced FIU their homecoming game. The insult of insults. 

This was the most clear-cut message anyone could have sent the young Golden Panthers. Better than any words Strock could have uttered. Because, trust me, he did not wait until this week, the seventh one of the season to begin motivating his team.

They did that themselves. Went to Troy, Ala. and returned to Miami with newfound life and respectability. Even though FIU returned to University Park with an 0-7 record, they were a different team - one that had lost to a I-A team 21-10. 

Maturity began to show that next week in practice. Players were conscious of what a homecoming team, deemed horrendous by schedule makers, can do. Padrick and the offense set out to start quickly against a team that was notorious for starting slow. Strock spoke about quick starts and his team responded. Winning 34-23, FIU might have played down a little bit to Holy Cross' level, but it was more a case of the Crusaders playing up to FIU's stature. 

Thursday against Jacksonville, FIU made up for that episode of bad television they put everyone through and shellacked JU 55-12 on Sunshine Network. Now, here is the catch: FIU made too many mistakes and need to correct things if they plan to win Saturday at Louisiana-Lafayette. 

Offensively, they looked like a fine-tuned, well-oiled machine that just kept churning. On defense, they contained the run - all in all, a solid performance. 

But there were too many instances in which FIU got lucky. Obviously, these mistakes would not have made a difference in the game. Not the way they were playing as a team, or against the opponent they were playing. 

Come this Saturday, those mistakes, the "little things" Strock has been dwelling on all year, will be detrimental. Never mind the Ragin' Cajuns are down this year, or that FIU seems to be playing great football. If tailbacks Diamos Demerritt, Adam Gorman or Rashod Smith (should he be healthy), try to stretch runs the way they did against the Dolphins, things could get ugly.

The backs were running hard hard north-to-south, but they need to realize when it is time to just go down. Wait until the next play. Especially inside the 20-yard line. Going into a supposed hostile environment, against a I-A team will not afford FIU the opportunity to make such mistakes. 

Basically, in layman's terms, they cannot put the ball on the turf six times as they did against Jacksonville. This is not Jacksonville. The backs should be commended for the way they have run the past two weeks. But complacency, in this instance, should be the dish of choice.

Any momentum they will carry going into Cajun Country will be generated by the success they have running the football. It appears FIU knows the consequence of falling behind early and limiting the offense to only passing while playing catch-up. 

So, we have heard little things, little things and more little things all season. From Padrick making the improper reads, to running backs being careless with the ball, to the defense not stopping the run. 

Well, they will matter immeasurably more than anything else this week.

Headline: Men's soccer blasts Philadelphia, Alabama A&M to win Golden Panther Classic
Author: Harry Coleman/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Oct. 31- FIU 6, Philadelphia 1 

Playing in its first game since its eight-game unbeaten streak was snapped, FIU needed a big game to get back on the winning track. 

They got one.

The No. 13 Golden Panthers, led by senior midfielder Johhny Pulido, routed the Philadelphia Rams 6-1 on Halloween night at University Park.

Pulido led FIU with two goals. Pulido's first goal (20:19) put FIU up 1-0, but he didn't stop there as he scored 19 seconds later on an assist from Bobby Boswell. 

Pulido did not see his play as a single player performance; he saw a total team effort.

"I had two good shots, but this is all a team effort. We played a good game and got a good victory," said Pulido.

Up 2-0, FIU followed with many scoring opportunities, but didn't score the third goal until the 29th minute when Boswell hit a cross from inside the box past Ram goalkeeper Justin Hewins into the far post. The assist was credited to Lucas Scudeler.

The chances of a shutout disappeared for FIU when Nolan Dzielak scored on a pass from Josip Babic in the 38th minute. 

FIU goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg recorded his only save of the game during the first half. 

Boswell, who deflected a shot that would have been an easy goal for the Rams, also helped hold the Rams to one goal.
Boswell said he was just in the right spot thanks to the advice of Rosenberg.

"It was funny, I usually mark up front but on the play, Rosenberg told me to stay by the post, and after I saved the goal he told me that's why I put you there," said Boswell.

Coach Karl Kremser credited the defense for Rosenberg only accounting one save.

"Well the reason he only got one save is because the defense played outstanding. I am satisfied with the way my team played today," said Kremser, whose team improved to 10-3-2.

After no substitutions in the first half, FIU opened the second half with much of its second unit. The Golden Panthers second unit outplayed the first of the Rams by scoring three goals in the second half. 

The fourth goal of the game came on a penalty shot by Jared Rose. The penalty shot was awarded to FIU after Ram goalkeeper Hewins tackled Oscar Gil down as he tried to zip a shot pass him.  Rose also recorded an assist on a goal by Anthony Louissaint in the 75th minute. 

Hewins received a red card on the play and was replaced by Scott Nixon, who finished the game with four saves.

With FIU up 5-1, the Golden Panthers didn't show any signs of slowing down. Boswell put the final touch on the game with a headshot off a corner kick by Rose. 

Kremser noticed the play of Boswell, who scored two goals despite being known for his strong play on the defensive side.

"Today he played more towards the center and had more scoring opportunities," said Kremser, who used Boswell effectively as a midfielder at times.

Kremser was also proud of the strong play of freshman Eythor Einarsson, who was just recently activated.

"It's good to see him out there because his presence definitely helped us," said Kremser of the six-foot defender from Iceland.

With the win, FIU improved its first place record to 3-0-1 in the Atlantic Soccer Conference.

Nov. 1- FIU 3, Alabama A&M 0

Junior Oscar Gil had his best offensive performance of the season, leading No. 13 FIU to a 3-0 victory over Alabama A&M at University Park on Nov. 1 to win the Golden Panther Classic. FIU has won all three tournaments it has hosted this season and improved to 7-1-0 at home this season.

Senior goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg recorded his fourth shutout of the season, finishing with five saves.

Gil got the scoring going in the 29th minute with an unassisted goal. FIU took a 1-0 lead into the half.

"I was happy to see Oscar Gil get a goal because it boosted his confidence," said head coach Karl Kremser.

In the 57th minute, senior Johnny Pulido scored for the third time in two days, converting on a free kick to give FIU a 2-0 advantage.

Gil added on an insurance goal on a header in the 78th minute. Pulido and senior Hendrix Emanuel assisted on the goal. 

FIU outshot Alabama A&M 17-8 in the contest and held an 8-3 advantage on corner kicks.

The Golden Panthers will round out the regular season with three home games, starting on Nov. 7 against division opponent Howard.

"Howard is a funny team, much similar to Alabama. Over the years, we have had good matches with them," said Kremser.

Headline: Offense explodes as FIU cruises to second win
Subheadline: Demerritt, Gorman combine for 259 yards on the ground; Padrick tosses 3 TDs
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The last time FIU and Jacksonville played, a power surge in the area caused the lights at FIU stadium to go out with three minutes to play as FIU led 39-6. JU coach Steve Gilbert insisted the game be finished after an approximate 40-minute delay, while FIU was in possession of the ball.

Similarities from last year's Oct. 31 meeting, such as the steady rainfall, were present but FIU did not afford the Dolphins' coach the option this year, as the Panthers turned the lights out early on JU in their 55-12 rout in front of 3,512 at FIU Stadium. 

The Golden Panthers, slow-starters before last week, jumped out to a 21-0 lead in the first quarter and built a 41-0 advantage by halftime on 494 yards of total offense. Freshman quarterback Josh Padrick's day ended at the half, but not before the Merritt Island native had completed 71 percent (10 for 14) of his passes.

"[Josh] ran the offense well and made some great decisions throwing the ball out there," FIU coach Don Strock said. "It's wet out there and he made some good throws. Progress is being made there."

Added Padrick, who has thrown for 391 yards in FIU's back-to-back wins: "Coach told us what to look for; I took the film to my dorm and everything they told us, we saw. Coach did a good job preparing us. 

"The weather was bad, but you still have to throw the ball. The receivers did a great job catching the ball."

Padrick threw three touchdowns (55, 16, 32 yards) and scored on a three-yard draw before giving way to backup David Tabor. 

The running back tandem of Diamos Demerritt (121) and Adam Gorman (138) accounted for 259 yards rushing. They each added a touchdown, with Gorman scoring from 4-yards out and Demerritt from 11.

FIU concluded its record-setting day with 642 total yards, including 396 rushing.

"The challenge to the team is, we could play with Holy Cross and Jacksonville, now we have to prove we can play with Louisiana Lafayette," said Strock, looking ahead to his team's game on Nov. 8. "Overall, we played well as a team. With the weather conditions we wanted to get the turnovers and we laid the ball on the ground [six times]. 

"If you are going to establish the run, you got to hold on to the ball."

The Golden Panthers ran Strock's quick strike offense to near perfection, scoring twice in less than a minute, and once in 1:04. 

FIU was able to take a commanding 21-point lead before the end of the first quarter when Chris Smith recovered a fumbled kickoff on the JU 22-yard line. After a six-yard run by Gorman, Padrick found receiver Harold Leath, who caught two touchdowns, in the middle of the end zone for a 16-yard score.

The FIU offense rode the surge their defense provided with a goal line stand on fourth down and marched 93 yards on 8 plays to expand their lead to 14-0 with 2:05 to go in the first. Strock's gamble was awarded on fourth-and-goal when Padrick scored on a draw play from the three-yard line. Following a Gorman fumble, FIU's defense and Jacksonville incurring a 15-yard penalty for interfering with Greg Moss' attempt to catch a punt, set up FIU's first score of the night. 

FIU began on their own 45 after the penalty and took an early 7-0 lead on a 55-yard reception by Cory McKinney. Quarterback Josh Padrick found the junior wide receiver in the flats where McKinney spun off a tackle before breaking free and going into the end zone untouched.	

Tailback O.J. Price and tight end Samuel Smith added touchdowns, as seven different Panthers reached the end zone. 

By the time the game was out of reach, JU scored two moral-boosting touchdowns in the second half to trim FIU's lead 55-12. FIU's defense held JU and the fourth-leading rusher in I-AA, Emmett Hunter, to 147 yards rushing - down considerably from their average of 263.2 per game coming in.

"We got to the ball better than we have [on defense]," said Strock, also impressed with the play of his offensive line. "Hopefully success will breed more success."

Headline: Editorial: Zero-tolerance policies leave no room for circumstance
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Last week, Rachel Boim was expelled from Roswell High School.  The circumstances surrounding the event leave little tolerance for the zero-tolerance behavior policies enforced by so many schools since the Columbine massacre.

The 14-year-old student had written a fiction story in her diary about a girl who falls asleep in class and dreams of killing her math teacher, and then awakens to find everything normal. 

Boim's art teacher overheard a conversation between Boim and a friend about the story.  

He then confiscated the diary, and turned it over to school officials, who, citing the school's zero-tolerance policy, suspended her for "inappropriate writings that describe the threat of bodily harm toward a school employee." 

She was later expelled from the school, despite her insistence that the writings were merely a work of fiction, never intended as a threat. There is nothing in the public domain to suggest that Boim was a danger.

She has since transferred to another school to avoid the unwanted attention and stress the incident brought her.

Obviously, the girl's actions were not a commendable course.  Those conversations are best left out of a sensitive school environment, and certainly, an adult should be counted on to make those distinctions.  

But Boim is not an adult. This is a 14-year-old girl who has much to learn about life.  The punishment, in this case, simply did not fit the crime.

The problem with zero-tolerance policies is that they leave little room for understanding, reminiscent of earlier zero-tolerance drug policies that arrested students for taking aspirin.

Schools are staffed by faculty, administrators, and counselors who we trust to make those decisions with careful consideration. Policies such as these leave no room for those guardians to put situations in their proper contexts, and devise solutions that would teach positive lessons to students.

Instead, the lesson that Boim has learned is that she should keep her thoughts to herself; that she should watch where her creative exploits lead her; and that failure to do so could lead to the strictest of punishments.  

That is the wrong lesson to have passed on to a 14-year-old girl, and those who are charged with her responsibility have essentially failed her.

A fight was broken up by Resident Director Mr. Stinchon when he found two apartment residents fighting in their room. An argument had broken out between two friends because one student had lent his keys to his friend who later left the first student stranded at the apartment of his ex-roommate. They had both been drinking that day and when the first student found his friend outside Panther Hall they had an argument. The argument ended back in the room when they started punching each other. Neither student wants to press charges and both will be reported to their residential advisors.

An FIU student declared her bag stolen from the Green Library's fifth floor. Inside her bag were two text books. She claims that it was taken between the hours of 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. 

FIU PD responded to a call from the GC food court. When the officer arrived, an FIU student reported that the suspect kept harassing female students and that although he had been reported before, he would usually leave before the police arrived. When the police officer asked for the accused's ID he realized the accused was not an FIU student and that he in fact had a bench warrant (issued on August 20, 2003) for resisting arrest without violence.The trespasser was then placed under arrest. His information was then processed  at FIU PD. The bench warrant was verified and  the tresspasser transported to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Facility. for booking. The accused trespasser was also issued a trespassing warning.

Food Services 

SGC President Nicaise Parillon opened with an update to the food evaluation project that SGC is conducting. Parillon met with Biscayne Bay Campus Food Service Director Paul Sparks on Oct. 29 to discuss food selection, food prices at BBC and other cafeteria concerns.
Sparks commented that some prices are high because when events are taking place at BBC, SGC and other organizations do not ask the BBC cafeteria to cater, and this causes BBC Food Services to lose money, according to Parillon. Sparks agreed to lower prices for catering so that SGC will use its catering services. 

Shuttle Service Complaints 

SGC Vice President Ruth-Allyson Webster pointed out that there have been a number of student complaints about the new shuttle service that provides transportation between the BBC and UP. Webster said that buses have been leaving early, buses have not showed up, and some drivers have been rude to the students.
Webster said that she contacted the Parking and Traffic department at UP and was told that they too received complaints and have been working on it. Webster said she will continue checking with them to assure that the concerns are addressed.

BBC rejects mosquito magnets

Biscayne Bay Campus' Facilities Management and Bay Vista Housing rejected a proposal by BBC-SGC to implement mosquito magnets at BBC, in view of the growing number of mosquitoes, especially in the housing area. 

The magnets are units that work off of propane gas. It will attract the female mosquitoes to it by fooling them into believing it is filled with food (blood). Once the mosquito is inside, it destroys the female's reproductive system so that she cannot breed, and kills her. 

BBC-SGC President Nicaise Parillon said that BBC Facilities Management acknowledges the growing problem with mosquitoes at the campus, but cannot afford the maintenance for the magnets of $25 a month. Instead, Nicholas Diciacco, Facilities Management's executive director of Business and Finance, agreed to meet with the county to discuss whether or not the campus can be sprayed once a week so that the mosquitoes do not get out of hand.

The current policy works so that the county only comes and sprays when the university requests the service, but the university only calls when there are a lot of complaints from students. 

Parillon said that she would give Diciacco two weeks to work with the county. If no agreement is made, SGC will carry out its plan for the mosquito magnets.

Headline: University of Michigan ruling not blank check
Author: Maryanne George/ Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
The lawyer who won the University of Michigan law school case in the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stern warning Wednesday to colleges nationwide: The court's ruling is not a blank check to use race to boost minority enrollment.

Universities must make sure their admissions process is fair and gives individual consideration to each applicant, Maureen Mahoney said in an interview in Ann Arbor. Mahoney is a partner at Latham & Watkins in Washington D.C. 

The court upheld U-M's law school admissions policy in June but struck down the 150-point undergraduate system that awarded 20 points to underrepresented minorities - the equivalent of a full letter grade boost. The court found that the policy did not consider each applicant as an individual.

"This decision should not be viewed as a green light to use race in an unchecked way," said Mahoney, who has won 11 of the 12 cases she's argued before the high court. "Universities should not place emphasis on the need to beat or exceed last year's minority enrollment percentages. It's not about ensuring specific percentages; it's about fair consideration for everyone. That includes the special contribution minority students can make to the class."

The decision in the law school case reaffirmed the court's 1978 ruling in the Bakke case that permitted race as a factor to further diversity. But many universities overemphasized the use of race, Mahoney said.

Universities also have a responsibility to improve K-12 education so consideration of race can be eliminated, Mahoney said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that in 25 years, racial preferences should not be necessary to further diversity. It was the same hope expressed by Justice Lewis Powell in 1978.

"The educational community has to take steps to reduce the disparities that make preferences necessary," Mahoney said. "They need to make sure there is enough money left over for early education initiatives. If they only try to get their share of the pie at the expense of these other efforts, they are not meeting the responsibilities imposed by the court's directives." 

Communities also need to step up, she said.

"It's not just about what universities do. It's about all of America and how we're going to prioritize," she said. 

Mahoney is a former U.S. deputy solicitor general and law clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.  As California businessman Ward Connerly prepares to launch a ballot initiative banning the use of racial considerations in public education admissions and hiring in Michigan, educators need to defend the value of diversity, Mahoney said.

"Universities have a responsibility to persuade the electorate that the benefits are just as important as the court thought and the programs are going to be applied in a way that minimizes the burdens," she said.

Headline: Olympic coach starts handball club
Author: Daniel Muela/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Renowned handball coach Christian Zaharia has started to organize a handball club for FIU students. He plans to make the club fully accessible to all students, as he believes that any student would benefit from the sport. 

"Handball is a sport that combines soccer and basketball into a fast paced experience that anyone can enjoy," said Zaharia.

The game is played on court similar to a basketball court, but larger. Each team consists of seven players (six court players and one goalie). The object of the game is to make as many goals as possible in the 60 minute time limit. 

Zaharia's background includes being a part of championship teams in Sweden, Germany, and in his home country of Romania. He is one of the seven best players in the world. He is the MVP of his position, left back. 

He has been playing the sport of handball for 26 years and has recently led the U.S. Men's National Team to a Bronze medal in last year's Pan American Championships held in Argentina. He was also an Olympian for Romania. 

  But student involvement is what will make or break this program. 

"A handball program sounds like an interesting activity," said freshman Anthony Roig.  

Zaharia already has practices set up and has gone from three to 16 members in less than a month. 

"I want all students who have any interest to come out and try out the sport," said Zaharia. 

The sport of handball itself is one that is highly competitive and fast-paced. Students who join should expect a rigorous work out and a unique new game  to try out. 

"Handball is a tough sport, but someone's got to do it," freshman Jimmy Gestwicki said.

Zaharia has big plans when he finally assembles the club. 

"I would like to travel to other universities and compete against some of the best handball clubs in the nation," Zaharia added. 

He plans to face Georgia State, North Carolina and Georgia Tech. 

Even though it is a club and not a set team, Coach Zaharia wants them to experience actual handball competition.

And Zaharia has also made it clear that anyone is welcome: men, women- as long as you have an open mind and heart for a new way to get fit and have fun. 

 He also wants to get the local media to come out to the games to get the word out that handball is one of the largest Olympic sports for a reason. 

He feels that his players have great potential and have the skill to get themselves known, and for a select few, all the way to the Olympics itself. 

Zaharia is optimistic as he believes that after getting initial funding from the Athletic Department and the Student Government Association, he is confident that his squad will attract sponsors to help support him in his quest for a successful handball program here at FIU.

Presently there are no fees to join the club. But as the program gets bigger and more equipment is needed, this may change, though Zaharia hopes to keep student fees as minimal as possible.

 The club will officially start in May. If students wish to participate in meetings and practices, they are being held on Thursdays from 7 -10 p.m. and Sundays from 4 - 7 p.m. in the Golden Panther Arena room 220. 

Students should prepare to meet at least five times a week as recommended by Zaharia. 

Zaharia does not want the Biscayne Bay Campus to feel left out, so he plans to have the club started on both campuses.

When Zaharia found out that other universities have gotten wind of his plans for FIU, he laughed it off. 

"I hope they feel intimidated; that's what I'm looking for," he said. "I want other schools to know that when we get up to speed we will be a team to be feared, not mocked."

Headline: Hospitality management opens program in China
Author: Jessica Martin/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's School of Hospitality Management has partnered with Tianjin University of Commerce to launch a Hospitality Management program that will emulate FIU's top-ranked program. 

"It is going to be a very big and exciting program," Thomas A. Breslin, vice president of Research said.

The primary goal of this partnership is to educate and prepare Chinese students to work in the hospitality industry. FIU hospitality students will benefit from this project as well; they will have the opportunity to study in China. 

"I think it would be cool to study in China. How many people get a chance to travel to the other side of the world?" said sophomore Ashley Barrington.

Tianjin, the third largest city in China, is in constant competition with rival cities Shanghai and Beijing for business. The Tianjin government has been looking for ways to bring high technology and new business to their city.  

In the midst of an enormous tourism boom, the Tianjin government has acknowledged the importance of having a hospitality management school at TUC. 

According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the annual growth rate of tourism in China is 10.9 percent.

"We believe that China will become a tourism economy like the world has never seen," said Jean-Claude Baumgarten, WTTC president.

There has been a great demand for qualified individuals to manage a contemporary hotel and tourism industry. Tianjin is not yet equipped to handle all of the new business.  The FIU School of Hospitality Management will provide instruction and ready Tianjin for the growing tourism economy.

TUC considered three different schools for the partnership.  FIU was chosen over Cornell University and Lausanne University. 

"I believe FIU was chosen because we are more student and service oriented," said Joseph J. West, dean of the School of Hospitality Management.

FIU, along with Tianjin, will recruit 15 Chinese business professors and enroll them in FIU's master's degree program.  Upon completion, these faculty members will be hired as FIU instructors to work at TUC.  In addition to the newly hired Chinese faculty, hospitality management faculty members from the Biscayne Bay Campus will be sent to TUC to teach three-week short courses. 

The city of Tianjin will set aside 80 acres and build a new $20 million dollar campus for FIU equipped with classrooms, dormitories and athletic fields. The new campus will be located within one mile of TUC., opening its doors to 1,000 students in fall 2006.

Once the bachelor's degree program at TUC has been fully operational for a couple of years, the school will also offer a master's degree program. The master's program will have 200 students. 

"This will be the largest foreign assisted education program at the university level in China," Breslin said.

West will be traveling to China periodically to discuss the layout of the new campus and curriculum design.

Future Chinese hospitality management students will begin school in 2004.  They begin their academic careers at the main TUC campus.Once the core courses are completed, they will begin hospitality courses in 2006 at the new campus.  

Upon entering the new campus they become FIU students who will earn FIU bachelor's degrees in Hospitality Management upon graduation. 

The new school will graduate its first class in spring 2008, just in time for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.

FIU currently has joint hospitality programs in Kingston, Jamaica and Luzern, Switzerland. Hospitality management will be closing both programs because of poor enrollment. The program was supposed to have 100 students, however enrollment never exceeded 25 students.

The Kingston program will close its doors in December.  The are no plans to have a second program in Kingston. However, the School of Hospitality Management hopes to have a course in Montego Bay, Jamaica. No official plans have been made.  

West hopes to expand the hospitality management school to France. 

There is an existing agreement between FIU and the International University of Monaco. FIU is talking with a university in Niece, France about establishing a partnership there as well.

Headline: ISA celebrates Indian Festival of Lights
Author: Yasmine Abellard/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
What do fashion, music, and dance have in common? They all come together in one night to celebrate Deepawali 2003, an annual cultural event presented by the Indian Students Association.   
ISA, which has traditionally held this event at the North Miami Beach Performing Arts Center for several years, will host the event there on Nov. 8 at 7:30 p.m. Deepawali or Diwali, is commonly known as the Festival of Lights. It is a Hindu festival celebrating the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and the joy of life. Diwali, a five-day-long festival, holds true to its meaning as millions of people throughout India place candles, oil lamps, and lights around their homes, illuminating the country. 
This festival is also marked by fireworks, the gathering of friends and relatives, and the exchange of sweets and gifts. This event, which draws approximately 1,000 people annually, is a collaborative effort by ISA members to provide an exciting and unforgettable performance for their guests. 
The students have been practicing several days throughout the week - in the Deuxieme Maison pit or near the Green Library - for this show.
"A lot of time and practice goes into this," said ISA Events Coordinator Sneha Dhanani.  
Dhanani who joined ISA a year-and-a-half ago, is choreographing the fashion show for the event this year. Although they started "off track," Dhanani assures that "everything is coming along beautifully." 
In addition to helping the students practice "movement, time and coordination," Dhanani will also be doing a solo performance combining Indian classical and folk dancing. "I love performing and the art of dancing and music - these are my passions." 
Festival attendees can expect to see anything from a traditional Indian fashion show, classic and modern dances, to comedy skits and disc jockeys spinning a fusion of hip-hop, reggae and Indian music, according to ISA President Aziz Kabani. 
Guests will also be able to sample an array of authentic Indian cuisine.  Although Diwali generally brings the Indian community together, Kabani hopes this year will draw a much more diverse crowd than previous years. 
"Every year, we end up attracting so many Indian people that are already familiar with the culture. What we're trying to do now, is we're trying to actually bring outsiders into our community, to see exactly what our culture is about," Kabani said.
Besides serving as a common ground for FIU's Indian community, the 70-plus-member organization also aims to provide various activities for non-members to experience the Indian culture, Kabani said. 
ISA hosts the following events throughout the year open to all: a Holi Picnic, an outing similar to paintball accompanied by a picnic; a Desi Bowl-a flag football tournament; a basketball and cricket tournament played with fellow University of Miami students; and a showcase of popular Indian movies (not to worry, they have subtitles). 
Aside from games, ISA also has packed bhangra parties, with sounds combining Punjabi music with modern techno, reggae, rap, hip-hop and rock (think "Beware of the Boys" remix with Panjabi MC and Jay-Z). 
As if the parties were not enough, ISA holds an annual end of the year cruise that is also done in collaboration with University of Miami students. Kabani, who has been a member of ISA during all four of his years at FIU, said that he has learned skills he can put into practice after graduation.
"You learn teamwork, leadership skills, [and] time management," he said. "It's just so much that's put on your plate, that you have no choice but to learn everything...it's definitely an experience."  
Kabani hopes that in the future, ISA will grow with students not only from FIU, but from neighboring universities as well. He also hopes that students will know what ISA truly stands for: "Good time, good people, good music."

Headline: "Brother Bear" signals end of era for cell animation
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Disney's latest animated feature "Brother Bear" may be the last of its kind, at least for now anyway. 

The end of an era is drawing near and the classic style of cell animation is taking its last few breaths of air. Its successor, computer animation, is cleaning up and taking charge of priority lists when it comes to child-geared films. 

The word "cartoon" is going to have a much different meaning in the future. Especially for those of us who grew up on Disney's classic animated movies, it's a little strange and unsettling to think of a world without them, but not entirely dismal. With masterpieces like "Finding Nemo" running around I'm all for the higher integration of computer animated films. 

None of this can be completely confirmed of course and even Disney creators hold high hopes for "Brother Bear," even though recent ratings speak with sour tongues. In case anyone didn't notice, "Brother Bear" is the third film completely animated at Disney's Florida animation studios, the other two being "Lilo & Stitch" and "Mulan." It's a well-known fact that if this film didn't pull through, the focus would shift primarily to Pixar's computer animation talents.

What's unfortunate about this is that it isn't necessarily the animation style's fault. The elegance of cell animation is unmatched, especially in "Brother Bear." 

There are just certain feelings you get with cells which you lose in a computer-drawn film. What feels lacking in the last few animated films, with the exception of "Lilo & Stitch" is the story element. 

Disney films seemed to have lost the glory earned in the early to mid '90s with films like "Beauty and the Beast," "Aladdin" and "The Lion King."  

One might blame the move away from the song-and-dance element, but it goes deeper. There simply isn't a genuine compassion felt in these films. 

Lately, they appear to have some sort of template and perhaps audiences are finally beginning to decipher the cookie-cutter style of filmmaking Disney is known for.

Disney really tries their hardest too, bringing in veteran Phil Collins (who worked on "Tarzan's" music) to do some scoring in addition to providing songs for "Brother Bear." 

As the first time doing a film score, Collins described it as "the most exciting thing I've ever done." Hopefully it won't be his last.

I can't say it isn't unlike Disney to put cell animation on the back burner and focus more on the potential gold mines that lie in computer animation. Cell animation is costly and requires a certain type of animator, which I fear will die out soon as well. 

I can only hope for a time when the beauty and glory of cell animation is resurrected and put to good use.

Headline: Death Cab pours new energy into Transatlanticism tour
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Like most bands in this genre, the "indie" label is too general a term to give to a group like Seattle's Death Cab For Cutie. If indie-rock was a spectrum of style, they would fall around the poppier, softer and lighter side. They own a very respectable repertoire of lovely music and command a strong legion of dedicated fans, making themselves a prominent name for underground indie music. 

Their Oct. 2003 release Transatlanticism is perhaps one of their most formidable albums, culminating years of hard work and reinvention. I had the special opportunity to speak with new drummer and old friend of the group, Jason McGerr. Death Cab For Cutie will be playing with Mates of State in on Nov 5 at the Respectables Street Caf√© in West Palm Beach.

Q: You're new to the group ?

A: I've been playing with the band for a year. I did the new record and I've known them all individually and played with them in different settings over the years before they were a band.

Q: With that in mind, was it weird acclimating yourself to the band, did you guys already have a connection going?

A: Easiest thing in the world. They had asked me to play with them in the past and but it never quite worked out because of our busy schedules. There was no bulls--t strangeness at all; it was like a long-term crush, just really easy to just step into the space. I already knew all the old songs and I used to play in bands with Nick (the bass player) so it was just really easy.

Q: What kind of new personal touch did you try to bring into the band?  

A:  A hell of a lot of energy and lots of input. For the first time in the band's history, I'm the first drummer that's actually been credited with song writing and arranging, it worked out really great. When you've been in a relationship for a long time you tend to overlook certain things; being new I was able to bring some fresh energy.

Q: How do you feel about the new record?

A:  I love it. We're talking about four people who made a record that really had only been together for two months before the recording started. To have this great of a result, which we're all really proud of, really affected and inspired me. The next record should be even better.

Q: Describe the creative process, how does it all go down?

A: Ben [Gibbard], who's the principal songwriter, wrote 25 songs. Some of them were more complete, others were very stripped down. 

A few of them didn't change much in the end like "Passenger Seat," it's pretty much what it was originally. We all listen to what's been written and talk about what we like and don't like. 

Being the songwriter sometimes you get too close and attached or too close and disgusted with, to the point where you don't even want to hear it anymore. "Title and Registration" was the song [Gibbard] was ready to can, but we all thought it was a great song. This album was really fresh; none of it was played live before we went into the studio to record it. Being able to step out with a brand new record was really inspiring, as opposed to The Photo Album. 

That material was toured for two or three times before it went into the studio. Everyone was kind of burned out on that material but they learned form their mistake and that's why we decided to record Transatlanticism in this manner, very similar to We Have The Facts And We're Voting Yes.

Q: How does it affect you and the other guys being out on tour for so long?

A: Daily fist fights...just kidding. 

For the first time the band has been able to afford a bus. We all have a little more space than you would imagine being tucked in a van. I think it's a lot easier, if you're going to do show after show after show The little added comfort makes everyone a lot more tolerable.

Q: How have the crowds taken to the new album?

A: Awesome, its unbelievable how many people have been coming out to the shows and people are singing the words, we're actually pretty taken back. Its nice to see how many people have already gone out and bought the record which has done far better than any other Death Cab record already.

You never know what can happen with a record; they're like your kids. You're proud of it and you put it out into the world but it does whatever it's going to do. You have no control once it's out there on it's own.

Headline: "Alien": A must-see on the silver screen for cinema-lovers
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
I still remember the first time I watched "Alien," I was about 12. 

I'd never been more scared by a film in my life and to this day it remains one of the scariest films in my library. 

I always imagined seeing this film in the theater on a gigantic screen with surround sound and beautiful image quality.

"Alien" is one of those many films that everyone is going to say can't be seen anywhere else but a movie theater. 

I agree wholeheartedly, seeing Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece in a movie theater was totally awesome, in every sense of the word. 

The "Director's Cut" tacked on to the title makes this re-release even more special. 

The film has been spiced up with a few extra goodies, making the experience generally, a tad more pleasing. 

The most obvious would be the digitally re-mastering and cleanup done on the film. 

The image quality is beautifully crisp, making noticeable several little details you'll miss otherwise. 

The color seems to have been given new life as well, vibrantly touching up and breathing life into the various futuristic settings. 

Aside from the image touch-up, the mere fact that the film is being projected on a huge screen makes a very significant difference. 

The screen size totally matters.

The same can be said about the sound. In a surround sound theater with very loud speakers, the audio track in "Alien" is much more effective in scaring the living bejesus out of you. 

Aside from the beautiful spacey soundtrack paired with the horrific screams that make "Alien" a classic in horror cinema, I would say the space ship Nostromo's self-destruct alarm system brings the concept of fear to an entirely different level. 

When the lone-survivor Ripley finds herself completely alone in the space-ship, lights flashing and flickering, with the ominous "star beast" stalking in the corridors, the bellowing sirens that ring throughout the entire theater creates such a horrifying and dramatic experience, I literally gripped the chair. 

Hands down, the best film sequence in the film, and all because of the audio.

There are a few other surprises in extra footage inserted in the film. 

There are a few extra clips that establish a bigger conflict between Ripley and some of the other crew members and there's an interesting but brief addition to the first murder scene, giving us an idea of what the creature looks like earlier on. 

Perhaps the most notable and enjoyable bonus material is the gruesome "cocoon" sequence, in which Ripley finds out what happened to her missing crew members. 

It gives us a better idea of what kind of animal our hero is dealing with and provides some insight into its habits, making this  footage the only noteworthy addition. 

The other additions feel generally useless to the film and make me think Scott added them in out of pure sympathy to "Alien" enthusiasts.

"Alien's" re-release in theaters could not have come at a better time than Halloween. 

The film that spawned three, soon to be four, more films still remains the most frightening horror film in my book. 

It reminds me that there will never again be another horror film with the kind of quality and integrity that "Alien" has. 

Fake-looking computer generated creatures have long replaced the H. R. Giger suit and the tactic of trying to scare us by not showing us the creature and leaving the horror to our own imagination.

At least we'll always have these special re-releases.

Headline: "Pieces of April": We all want forgiveness, an oven that works
Author: Michelle Roberts/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
No family is perfect, especially April's family.  	

"Pieces of April," a darkly comedic and touching film, almost came out of nowhere.  

The directorial debut of screenwriter Peter Hedges (known for his work in the film "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"), starring television's prime-time girl-next-door, Katie Holmes, is a strong attempt at creating a raw feature about a girl living on her own, attempting to prepare Thanksgiving dinner, when her oven breaks.  

And that's the least of her problems.

Holmes plays the estranged daughter of a family built on idiosyncrasies.  There's a terminally ill and hateful mother, a senile grandmother, a mama's boy brother, an annoyingly perfect sister, and indifferent father.  

When they all decide to pack into one car and drive to New York to visit April, the daughter that went wrong, chaos ensues.

Holmes does a fine job at portraying a character that is evidently the anti-Joey Potter.  

Not only is her appearance the polar opposite of Holmes' cult "Dawson's Creek" image, but also her range as an actress has stretched a bit since the show's finale.  

Holmes has come a way since the WB and "Teaching Mrs. Tingle."  

All eyes are on her, as she will undoubtedly try to break free from her longtime television persona.

Hedges must be commended for the delivery of such a witty script, which is what gives the film such life and spunk.  

The quick quips between the dysfunctional family unit provide for genuinely intelligent and funny dialogue.  

Hedges' directing is not to be overlooked either, as his camera techniques really express a sense of a twisted home video, bringing the audience that much closer to the uncomfortable encounters with this family.  

Some of the shots in "Pieces of April" are also very artistic and carry a heavier meaning, adding to the movie's character.  Without Hedges' vision and ability, "Pieces of April" might not have been the unique and relatively strong film that it is.  

The overall look of the film is essential to capturing the feelings of the characters, as they all wear very little make-up, giving "Pieces of April" the gritty, realistic edge it thrives on.  Like any movie, though, the caliber of actors on board brought the script to life.  Patricia Clarkson and Oliver Platt, who play April's parents, effectively deliver the dark humor with sincerity and sentimentality.  On a smaller scale, "Pieces of April" tells a story almost everyone can relate to.  After all, we all want acceptance, forgiveness, unity and, of course, an oven that works.

Headline: Wooden Leather: Sounds like Nappy Roots needs a hug
Author: Cyntianna Ledesma/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Someone give the Nappy Roots guys a hug and a tissue! They need it after all this harsh stuff they've been through.

Wooden Leather, the latest release from Nappy Roots, has powerful lyrics, but they are very somber and leave you feeling bad for these guys. Most of the songs are about being poor, life in the country, and all the tough things the group members have faced.

"Sick and Tired" will leave you feeling especially drained. In this song, the guys rap about all the hardships of their lives, having a bad job, giving up on their dreams, watching their mom "breakin' her neck for the pay check." 

All six guys get to say what they are sick and tired of in this song. The most lyrically appealing verse of this song is rapped by Skinny DeVille: "I'm tired and sick of bummin rides / on top of that my nine to five / sucks for a couple bucks / and change now what's the reason why / my luck don't amount to f*** / no matter how hard I try / I'm stuck in the 22 now catch me when I'm sick and tired." 

That verse pretty much sums up the message of "Sick and Tired" and Wooden Leather.There are many hip-hop/rap artists out there who cry about their lives through their music, most of them have some good beats to back up their whining, but these beats are not much to brag about. 

They mostly drag on and don't change around enough to keep you interested. Some songs actually start off interesting, but then become redundant. "Twang," for example is basically about a girl who caught a guy's attention and now, he wants to get in her pants. The song has a strange, Arabic rhythm that gets lost in the background hip-hop beat. There is so much going on in that song, that it's hard to pay attention to just one thing, therefore, losing your attention completely. 

On a better note, this is one of the few uplifting songs on the album.The first single from this album, "'Round Tha Globe," is another uplifting song. This song has everything: a good beat, interesting lyrics and enough action to keep you interested. But this song is not an accurate representation of the rest of the album.

This album is by no means pleasant or fun. It's not one you'd be blasting while driving around with your friends, unless you're all in a really bad mood.

Subheadline: Week-long fair brings world-reknown authors to Miami
Author: Sasha Boca / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Miami Book Fair International 20th Anniversary edition is coming to rock the literary world Nov. 2 - 9, and all FIU students should seize this opportunity to meet world renowned authors and enjoy the cornucopia of activities it has to offer.  

The Florida Center for the Literary Arts at Miami Dade College founded the Book Fair as part of a larger effort to bring attention to the literary arts and in doing so promote reading, writing and overall literacy in our diverse community. 

The Book Fair 2003's programs include, but are not limited to, "Evenings with ...," a nightly reading by one of over 300 authors both local and international that will be in attendance.  Among the local talent are our very own FIU professors:  Les Standiford, presenting his eighth novel "Havana Run" and Oren Baruch Stier, associate director of the Judaic Studies Program, debuting his book "Committed to Memory:  Cultural Meditations of the Holocaust." Denise Duhamel, who teaches poetry, and John Dufresne, who teaches creative writing, will also be among those debuting work and making FIU proud.  

The "Children's Alley" program will interest the kiddies and their guardians with interactive and educational fun, including hands-on activities, games, exhibits, stage performances, thematic areas and more.  

Programs like the "Lifestyles" tent will satisfy those interested in home, motivation, holistic health and spirituality, while the "Antiquarian Annex" will cater to book lovers in search of rare finds.

Among the numerous festivities, there will be a diverse variety of musicians, dancers and theatrical performances at the Concert Pavilion throughout the weekend.  The music will range from African drums, funk beats & Latin rhythm to Brazilian pop/rock and more, while the dancing will include acrobatic performances and the talents of Middle Eastern belly dancers to name a couple.  

For those who love to shop, there are more than one million books for sale, representing our nation's top publishing houses and bargain book sellers.  And what kind of international fair would it be without the guilty pleasure of mouth-watering fair food ranging the globe and spicing things up?  

The highlight of this event, will, of course, be the Congress of Authors which includes internationally-acclaimed authors as well as local writers who make the literature that expands our understanding of human nature and diversity in a multi-cultural environment.

It is an integral part of the logic of capitalist globalization, generating profits while at the same time accelerating the loss of workers' rights, wage decreases, the triumph of corporate agribusiness over family and subsistence farms, environmental degradation, the displacement of indigenous peoples and the privatization of public industries. Alongside the imposition of militarization and natural resource-focused accords like Plan Colombia, the Andean Regional Initiative, Plan Puebla Panama and the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the FTAA is designed to concentrate wealth and power into a few corporate hands at the expense of everyone else.
