Headline: Special treatment of athletes can get pretty ridiculous
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Imagine driving down a rural road in the middle of the night, when all of a sudden a deer appears out of nowhere and causes you to lose control of your car and you crash off the side of the road. 

Now, imagine how much more upset you'd be to find out the deer that caused you to crash turned out to be fake and was part of a high school prank.

That's exactly what happened to two Kenton, Ohio teens on the night of Nov. 18, 2005. 

The two teenagers charged the week of Aug. 14 with the prank were sentenced to 60 days in jail - deservedly so. But there are two minor problems: both convicted teens play football and Kenton, located in northeast Ohio, is a big football town.

A judge ruled that the football players from Kenton High School, which averages 4,000 fans every game, could serve their sentence after the football season ended.

You don't even need to be one of those boys involved in the crash to be furious at the situation.

Special treatment of athletes is not something new in this sports-obsessed society, but it's an epidemic in towns like Kenton, with a population of 8,000 in which half attend the local high school football games.

What lesson do the athletes learn by serving their sentence after the season?  It doesn't even make any logical sense.

Even though the two football players are seemingly serving enough of a sentence - including remaining under house arrest once released, paying fines, performing community service and having to write an essay titled "Why I Should Think Before I Act" - the delay of the sentencing is still very dubious 

On the Sept. 13 episode of "Inside Edition," the mother of one of the football players agreed with the judge's sentence -surprise, surprise. She claims that football has kept her kid off the streets and has kept him in line.

Umm. Is she completely ignoring the fact that her son stole a fake deer in the middle of the night, placed it in the middle of a dark road and laughed from a distance as people swerved around it? 

Football has made her son such an accountable and exemplary citizen that the minute someone crashed - and almost died - because of his senseless prank, he fled the scene immediately. 

As a judge, how can one even get away with such favoritism? The purpose of the justice system is to teach offenders a lesson. I think there would have been no bigger lesson than to ruin these brats' football season - even if the team suffers because of it.

The father of one of the convicted boys complained to CNN.com that members of the community have made crude remarks when his family went shopping at the local Wal-Mart. 

"I don't know why it's about football players. Why isn't it about student council or track?" he asked CNN.com. "He admitted what he did and he faced the consequences like a young man should."

That's fine and dandy sir, but no student council or track team members were involved in causing the near-death of two teenagers. And if they were, they would sure as hell serve their sentence as soon as possible.

The worst part of all is that the football team itself is not taking any disciplinary action.

Now, take the recent incident with the University of Texas football team when two of their contributing players, Tarell Brown and Tyrell Gatewood, were charged with possession of less than two ounces of marijuana. Brown was also charged with illegal possession of a weapon.

Immediately after the charges were filed, the players were suspended indefinitely from the team and their future with the program is in jeopardy, depending on the outcome of impending sentencing.

It didn't matter that Texas, the No. 2 team in the country at the time, was playing No. 1 Ohio State that same week.

Texas went on to lose the game. But the team and the two players learned a valuable lesson: Bonehead behavior off the football field will tarnish your future on it.

Sadly enough, most teams are still going to give star players special treatment and the only ones who suffer in the end are the players. They can get away with murder - or, in this case, causing a near-fatal car wreck - and will never be taught a lesson.

Headline: Hope's two goals lead men's soccer over FAU
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
David Hope entered the match against Florida Atlantic with a memory etched in his mind. When FAU upset FIU 2-0 in 2004, the Owls danced on the field at University Park Soccer Stadium.

Big mistake.

That disrespect inspired Hope to score both goals in FIU's 2-0 victory over FAU Sept. 13. Two years after watching his rivals taunt the men's soccer team on its home field, Hope answered back. 

"They talked a lot of trash to us the last two years," he said. "Right when I saw that FAU was the next game, that was my main focus. I just wanted to beat them."

Hope's goal in the 39th minute prevented any chance of an FAU encore. Owls goalkeeper Phillip Lamarre rushed to clear a through ball from midfielder Richard Martinez, but Hope beat Lamarre to the ball just outside the penalty area and knocked it into the goal. 

Midfielders Dadi Kristjánsson and Bruno Barbosa then assisted on Hope's second goal in the 51st minute. Barbosa played the ball down the left wing to Kristjánsson, who sent a bullet pass into the penalty area. Hope slipped behind the FAU defense and tapped the low cross in to give FIU a 2-0 lead.

"I owe Dadi and Richard big time," he said. "Dadi's given me a few assists that I haven't been able to put away and this is the second game in a row that Richard gave me an assist. I can't say anything bad about them."

FAU out-shot FIU 15 to 14, but struggled to find the net. The Owls nearly got on the scoreboard with a rocket shot from Borce Ancevski in the 72nd minute, but FIU goalkeeper Shawn Crowe saved the blast. 

Crowe fell on his back after making the save and the ball bounced towards another FAU forward. Sire Standnes fired a shot at point blank range, but Crowe recovered just in time to make another quick save.

"I told Shawn that, sometimes, it's not how great of a save you make but when you make the save," head coach Karl Kremser said. "If FAU would have scored that goal, they'd get new life.

"Shawn made two back-to-back saves, so that became even more important by giving our guys confidence and taking the life out of them."

Crowe had seven saves in the match. Senior defenders Chris Handy and Sheldon Jardine teamed with juniors Ainsley Deer and Raoul Voss to help him gain his second shut-out of the season.

"Our guys were getting tired in the back, but we kept focus and had to get the shut-out," Crowe said. "We had to get that goose egg and, when the shots were coming, I just kept telling myself 'react, react, react.' 

"My defense played excellent and I knew I was going to get the shut-out after that first shot." 

The score-line momentarily read 3-0 until an offside call negated an FIU goal. At the start of the 84th minute, sophomore forward Levi Coleman lobbed a pass to Kristjánsson, who scored on a header from three yards out.

The goal was quickly waved off when head referee John David said Kristjánsson was offside. Had it counted, the goal would have been Kristjánsson's second of the season.

FIU still managed to continue its dominance over FAU. The Golden Panthers have won eight of the last ten matches against their rivals from Boca Raton, including last year's dramatic 3-2 overtime finish. 

The latest win puts the all-time series at 25-3-1 in FIU's favor. 

"These are our rivals. You always have to beat FAU," Kremser said.

Subheadline: Puerto Rican national outside hitter takes aim for Golden Panthers
Author: Jannel Palenzuela / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In only her first year at FIU, outside hitter Yarimar Rosa has some notable numbers to add on to her already impressive résumé. 

The 5'10" freshman from Vega Baja, Puerto Rico currently leads the team and the Sun Belt Conference with 180 kills. 

She is also one of the top 10 leaders of the conference with a .321 hitting percentage with a minimum of .200 and 3.0 attacks per game.

Rosa has also played for a few national teams including the Puerto Rican National Team at the North, Central America and Caribbean Volleyball Confederation (NORCECA) Olympic Qualifying Tournament in December 2003. At just 15-years-old at the time, she was the youngest player in the tournament. 

Afterward, she was named captain of the Puerto Rican U-18 team during the NORCECA Continental Championship in July 2004. She then went on to play for the U-20 team this summer from July through August where she led her team with 18 points during their final game against the Dominican Republic.

"When I played for each of the national teams I learned a lot," Rosa said. "The girls that you play with have so much experience that you can't help but gain some as well."

She averaged 5.45 kills per game - including 35 in a win against Xavier. Leading the team with 200.5 points may give her a reason to be emotional on the court. 

However, Rosa finds herself continuously trying to contain her excitement.

"Over [in Puerto Rico] the game is more active and more emotional," Rosa said. "Here I try not to celebrate after every single point, but rather after a game, or once the match is over."

Coach Danijela Tomic added, "Ever since she got here the level of everybody is up. Her skill level and her personality on the court bring all those intangibles that just make everyone around her better."

It is not only her teammates and coaches that have noticed the excitement Rosa brings to the game, but the fans have also become aware of it.

"Even the fans that have seen her play notice it and see it in the rest of the team also," Tomic said. "Our team is very exciting to watch."

"She plays with a lot of emotion," sophomore outside hitter Olga Vernun said. "It just rubs off on the rest of us."

Even though one might think it would be easier to play in an arena than outside in the sun, Rosa admits that for her it was the complete opposite. 

"I was so used to playing outside that when I got here, I had to adjust to the arena and the air conditioner," Rosa said. "It took me quite a while at first."

Perhaps the biggest obstacle she has come across is learning English. Fortunately, she has her coaches and teammates to assist her.

"They all help me out [learning English]," Rosa said. "I know it is necessary and they are helping me little by little."

Apparently she has had no problem communicating on the court. She is one of three freshmen starters and has helped lead FIU to a tie (along with New Orleans) for first place in the conference.

"I feel I can bring what this team is missing to really continue to improve our records, as well as become conference champions," Rosa said.

Coach Tomic added, "She will definitely grow and mature physically and mentally [as the season progresses]. She is a young player and, at just 18-years-old, she is a true freshman that will only continue to get better. She and the rest of our team is in a maturation process."

With most athletes, trying to improve you game will come with making some mistakes. In those moments of distress, some athletes can lose their cool because they no longer have control of the moment. However, Rosa finds ways to keep hers. 

"Whenever I feel a bit unfocused because things are not going how I had hoped, I wait until there is a timeout called and try to refocus," Rosa said. "I really think about what I am doing wrong and tell myself that it already happened and it has passed. 

"As I take a deep breath, and I tell myself that I have to focus to help my team come up with the win."

On a more personal note, it is the English language that the Puerto Rican native struggles with the most. Yet she hopes to overcome that obstacle in no time.

"Learning English is my main goal and so is completing my bachelor's degree," Rosa said.

But as any other student-athlete, there is one focus for Yarimar Rosa and, judging by the way she plays, it doesn't seem she will be letting up any time soon.

"I hope to be able to come up with the strength to help lead my team to the conference championship," Rosa said. "And perhaps become overall champions."

Subheadline: Parking and traffic department listens to students
Author: Cameron Lewis / Sophomore / Public Health Major 
&nbsp;
I would like to commend the Student Government Association and the Parking and Traffic Department for the open forum that was held Wednesday, Sept. 13 in GC 140. I left the meeting with a greater assurance that the University is working its hardest to accommodate the very evident parking issues that trouble our campus. Like many other frustrated students, I began to feel that the concerns of FIU student drivers were falling on deaf ears. However, those feelings were dismissed today. I encourage my fellow students to be patient and to try to hold their tempers as much as possible. Although we live in a "right here, right now" society, we need to realize that developments such as new parking lots, garages, or shuttles cannot be realized in a matter of weeks. Once again, I praise the efforts of SGA and the Parking and Traffic Department. Thank you for being open and responsive.

Headline: Media hype cries 'wolf,' boosts ratings
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It never fails. The bigger the storm, the bigger the media blitz.  Every time there is a storm heading our way, there's bound to be media coverage and lots of it. 

Every major station always has an expert from the National Weather Service to tell us about Hurricane What's-its-name.  Where is it going?  How strong is it? How fast are the winds?  How much rainfall?  How much of Florida will be struck and for how long?  

Now here comes the biggest question: are the news stations really reporting to help people or to outdo each other?  

News stations are becoming so competitive that they care more about breaking the best coverage than about pooling their resources to provide a better public service. 

This is what makes people mistrust the media. This repeated misuse and abuse of information causes unnecessary panic among residents, and the media is the last thing we need to worry about when storms come around.

Granted, we can't afford to take chances with hurricanes. We need to take each storm seriously in order to make sure we're well prepared, and the news stations' coverage must reflect that sense of urgency. 

However, cases like the one we just experienced with Hurricane Ernesto a few weeks ago - where so much hype builds up, only to turn out to be a false alarm - desensitizes the public and leads them to take future storms less seriously.  

I understand that the tracking a storm is not an exact science yet, but are is the media making this a big deal to boost ratings or is true journalism their intention?  

The public does not need to be misled at a time of potential crisis because of the media's selfish goal to be "the leader in storm coverage."

Subheadline: Global climate predictions theory, not fact
Author: Jessica Garcia-Iñiguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
These days, you can't seem to turn on the TV without hearing the debate surrounding global warming. So who's telling the truth? 

This battle between theories of fire and ice has never been more heated than it is now. The question worth asking, though, is whether there should even be a battle. However, the information fed to the public and the propaganda of extremists deserve to be heavily scrutinized.

Global cooling is a theory that predicts an overall decrease in the atmospheric temperature of the Earth, which may result in glaciation. Global warming argues that an increase in the Earth's greenhouse gases causes corresponding changes in climate. The global cooling theory has taken the back burner in the recent mainstream consensus. However, this hasn't always been the case. 

Throughout the 1970s, the consensus was that global cooling was the imminent climatic threat. Back then, the theories of aerosols and "orbital forcing" were accepted as the dominant causes of climate change. Orbital forcing refers to changes in the tilt of the planet's axis and the shape of orbit rotation. Aerosol is a by-product of fossil fuel combustion.  

Major newspapers and magazines, such as Newsweek, printed feature articles on global cooling, much like the special treatment the media gives global warming today. 

 In current speculation, global warming is said to be the result of increased amounts of greenhouse gases - specifically, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels - being released into the atmosphere. While both theories are viable, neither has yet been established as fact. 

There are numerous ongoing scientific efforts to understand the Earth's past in order to predict its future climate changes. However, our scientific understanding of the current climate system is still incomplete. 

Over the years, there has been a widely documented history of extreme climate fluctuations that have taken place. These extremes have been found to parallel solar activity to a great extent. Solar ultraviolet, visible and heat radiation are primary factors in determining the Earth's climate, including average global temperatures. Solar cycles are a fluctuating source of energy, and as a result, the effects they have on the Earth's climate vary correspondingly. The many factors affecting our climate make it difficult to point to either global warming or cooling.

Global cooling was the prevailing theory in the 1970s; global warming has been in vogue since the 1990s. Within a short thirty years, the mainstream consensus shifted from one theory to its complete opposite. This shows just how unsure we are about these theories. Consensus is not science and cannot be taken as truth, unless properly correlated evidence is presented.

As the yearly trends in scientific analysis make their debut, we see clear parallels in public opinion shifting between global warming and global cooling. If there is a clear answer to these questions, it is safe to assume we may never understand it in our lifetime.

Subheadline: Music: Persephone's Bees
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Picture yourself embarking on a sunshine-morning trip through neon-green electric marshmallow fun land. You look around and everyone is all smiles as you skipetty-skip your way down a gumdrop-cobbled lane. A family of milk-chocolate bears is having a picnic under the soothing shade of a grove of lollipop trees, and as you walk across the bridge that spans the fizzy orange soda-pop river, a creamy nougat bluebird perches on your shoulder. This, or something very similar, is what you will experience when you pop into your CD player a copy of Persephone's Bees' sophomore LP, "Notes From the Underground."

 For the past six years, Persephone's Bees had been an obscure indie band in their hometown of San Francisco. Despite its haunting, Eastern European-flavored melodies and flawless pop hooks, their debut album, "City of Love" was largely overlooked, available for sale only in local record shops and directly through the band's website. The band did not know what hit it when Columbia offered them a record deal that swept them out of quiet indie-dom and toward potential mainstream recognition. Clips of songs from their new album appear everywhere from TV spots for Cingular and Hilton Hotels to the soundtrack for the movie adaptation of "Bewitched," and MTV showcased the band in its overview of the SXSW music festival on the series "You Hear It First." Before you scream "Sell out!," though, it is essential to point out that even a casual listening of "Notes From the Underground" shows that the Bees haven't compromised a drop of their idiosyncratic flavor in producing their major-label debut. 

But back to the marshmallows and lollipops. The album kicks off with "Way to Your Heart," which sets the tone for the first half of the album with a rolling keyboard accompaniment reminiscent of Vince Guaraldi's piano arrangements for the cartoon version of Charles Schultz's "Peanuts." After the whimsical second track, "Climbing," which could very well serve as the soundtrack to a children's TV show, the album picks up with the retro-mod "City of Love." Complete with a baseline that points back to Dee-Lite's "Groove is in the Heart" and a game-show-like Wurlitzer riff, the day-glo hues of "City" would make Austin Powers proud. The single "Nice Day" follows that cue with "Na-na-na" choruses and percussion beats that scream of Spanish ye-ye kitsch and French 60s pop.

The album takes a sharp turn after the fifth track, the deliciously noir "Muzika Dlya Fil'ma," in which singer Angelina Moysov's tone takes a turn from bright to disaffected. In "Muzika," Moysov returns to the Adriatic influences that colored the 'Bees' first album, singing in her native Russian over spaghetti-western dramatics and dark surf guitar progressions. Following a brief lull that echoes back to the first half of the album, "On the Earth" leads the record on to a darker path, which culminates with the roaring psychedelia of "Queen's Night Out," a monster roar of organs and fuzzed-out guitars that is equal parts Iron Butterfly and Jefferson Airplane.

"Notes From the Underground" is a spectacular album, both on the merit of Moysov's exquisite accent and sensual voice and guitarist Tom Ayres textured arrangements. If the purpose of music is to transport its listener to another place, "Notes From the Underground" is one of this year's most successful releases.

Subheadline: Film: The Last Kiss
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Zach Braff made a lot of fans with his directional debut "Garden State," a good film with a fantastic soundtrack. The success and popularity of that film left many in the late teen to mid-twenties demographic anticipating his follow-up. Although we still have to wait for his sophomore film as director, "The Last Kiss" will have to do for now. After all, it's being sold as a follow up of sorts.

"The Last Kiss" isn't directed or written by Braff. Instead, it's written by a more popular name in film these days - Paul Haggis, the man who wrote "Million Dollar Baby" and won an Oscar for co-writing "Crash." Although being advertised as a romantic comedy, "The Last Kiss" is far from one. In fact, I'd go as far as to call it depressing. Watching four guys in their 30s who live with gorgeous women and have it made yet whine about how unsatisfactory their lives are isn't my cup of tea. 

Now, I'm not saying I didn't like the movie. The film has its moments and does offer some good insights on relationships. However, despite good performances from Blythe Danner and Jacinda Barrett, it failed to grasp my attention or my interest for that matter. Additionally, it seemed to me that Haggis and director Tony Goldwyn weren't sure whether they were making an ensemble film in the vein of "Short Cuts" and "Crash," or a romantic drama about the complications of a young couple. The movie flip-flops between the two, trying to be both but eventually succeeding in neither.

So what's it all about? Michael (Braff) and Jenna (Barrett) are a young couple who are expecting a child. While Jenna seems to be welcoming the addition to their lives, Michael has been rattled by this and checks himself into the early mid-life crisis club. Even though his life is exactly what he expected it to be, he's afraid that the next step in his life will lead to the end of his "freedom." To make things worse, Kim (Rachel Bilson), a beautiful college student, has been coming on to him like a race horse, like we see only in a Hollywood movie. He starts having doubts about the state of his current relationship and heads toward making a huge mistake. His friends aren't as lucky as he.

Chris (Casey Affleck) can't stand his wife because she constantly nags at him for being a slacker. She wants him to be more responsible and take care of their infant son instead of hanging out at his friend's apartment watching lesbian strippers go at each other on a hammock. Their sub-plot isn't fully realized, just as the sub-plots involving the other two friends Izzy (Michael Weston) and Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) who spend much of their screen-time crying and being naked, respectively. Maybe if I'd known a little more about Chris's marriage or the reason behind Izzy's relationship crisis, I would have cared more for the film.

Also coming as a distraction is the sub-plot involving Jenna's parents, played by Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner. Is her husband's cold behavior the only reason for her freakish cry for attention?

Well, I didn't get any answers because "The Last Kiss" doesn't provide them. It concentrates on Braff's story, which drags the picture toward its conclusion before unexpectedly fading to black, leaving me wanting so much more.

"The Last Kiss" is a film that had much promise, with its talented cast and hot-shot writer, yet it falls way below expectations by resembling a "been there, done that" A&E Movie of the Week.

Headline: Arts programs promise diverse performances
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
If you're tired from constant studying (or partying), then you may find it relaxing to attend some of the performing arts events happening this semester all around University Park. The School of Music and the School of Theatre and Dance have a variety of shows that offer a welcome break from classes and hangovers. 

Whether you enjoy listening to the soothing sounds of classical music, watching the performance of African-Caribbean dancing or seeing stories unfold on stage, you can find something to stimulate your mind this fall.

SCHOOL OF MUSIC



The School of Music's fall schedule ranges from shows showcasing jazz music to concerts featuring FIU's own big band and symphony orchestra. Even if you're only going to a show because of a class requirement, the array of different musical genres being performed this semester should keep you awake.

On Saturday, Oct. 21, the school will be having its Fall Jazz Festival Day. This event begins at 8:00 p.m. in the Wertheim Concert Hall and will be directed by Sam Lussier. Aside from a performance by the FIU Big Band, Los Angeles trumpet player Wayne Bergeron will be making a guest appearance. 

"I never really enjoyed Jazz music until my friend dragged me to one of the FIU shows," said sophomore Michael Hernandez. "Having a prominent artist like Bergeron performing here is a pretty big deal for me now."

In November, the FIU Music Festival will take place in the Wertheim Concert Hall. The 2-week long festival opens with a performance by the FIU Symphony Orchestra on Nov. 2 and culminates with a performance by trumpet player Arturo Sandoval and the FIU Big Band on Nov. 18.

A ticket is needed for admission to both events, and you can get more information by calling (305) 348-1998.



The Department OF THEATRE AND DANCE 



Starting its season in October, the Theatre department is putting together two different plays for students to watch: "Anna in the Tropics" and "The Dining Room."

"Anna in the Tropics," written by Nilo Cruz, tells the story of a Cuban family who manufactures cigars in Ybor City, Florida during the 1920s. The family is influenced by the book "Anna Karenina," which is read to them by a lector while they roll cigars. 

"The storytelling deals with the cigar-making industry and entertains a love plot," said Professor Phillip Church.

The other play, "The Dining Room," focuses on the decaying of traditional American values. It features a cast of 8 actors and actresses, all of which play different characters throughout the play.  

"The play takes place in the Northeast and examines the lives of several characters," said Church. "The central room in the play is the dining room."

"Anna in the Tropics" is at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center from Oct. 5-15, while "The Dining Room" will be performed Nov. 9-19. Tickets are $8 for students and $10 for non-students and can be purchased at the box office in the WPAC.

The FIU Dance department also has a full schedule this semester, starting with a dance theater work by Heather Maloney and John Beauregard. Entitled "Falling Up," the work delves into the recovery of a rape victim as well as the recovery of a handicapped man. Taking place Oct. 6 and 7 at 8:30 p.m. in Viertes Haus 100, the show is open to everyone, but ticket prices have yet to be announced.

"I've seen Heather Maloney perform before, and her work is really touching," said junior Juan Diaz. "This play in particular really moved me and showed how two people tried to cope with their problems."

Notable choreographer Gelan Lambert, trained in both American and African dance, will be having concerts in VH 100 on Nov. 11 and 12. Lambert will be performing solo and incorporating African-Caribbean, Hip-Hop and modern dance techniques into the show. After the show, Lambert will improvise moves suggested by the audience and make up choreography.

Subheadline: Getting rid of the angst
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Some aspects of adolescence never fade no  matter how old you get. Milking your parents for money, gossiping or wasting time online when you could be doing something productive are all good examples.

However, there are some habits that need to be locked away in a drawer along with your overpriced class ring, 'N Sync box set and horrifying pictures of you in your goth stage.  At the top of this list should undoubtedly be your teenage angst.   

If you're unsure what qualifies as angst, it's the "why me?," life is unfair, authority sucks voice in your head that assures you that despite all your rage, you're still just a rat in a cage. 

Granted, there are a few personalities that can use this anger to their benefit. Hell, Kurt Cobain made a career out of it. But, given how his situation turned out, in order to become a fully functioning adult, you have to learn how to let things go.  



The world is not out to get you



Now I'm not saying you have to smile graciously and offer your pen when a cop writes you a ticket or recommend romantic restaurants when your girlfriend tells you she's decided to date your best friend, but the way you react is what defines you as evolved. 

When bad things happen, you can't shake your fist at the heavens and claim your wretched life has been singled out for God's amusement. Bad things happen to everyone, probably worse than your situation. This is important to remember before you pull out a sharpie to write "My ex is a dirty slut!" on a bathroom stall. 



Pick your battles



Adults, for the most part, know what's worth wigging out for. Someone looking at you the wrong way at a club or getting jipped out of a full box of fries with your value meal are not among them. Before letting minor annoyances turn into full blown freak outs, you have to ask yourself, "Do I really need seven more fries?" Are seven more fries worth spending a night in jail after strangling a 15-year-old McDonald's employee? I think after considering Bunny, your 6 foot 5 linebacker cellmate, your answer is going to be a firm "no."



Don't lose your edge



Dropping the angst doesn't mean you have to prance about campus handing out daisies while singing "We are the World." Constant peace and love are products that come out of a culture too drugged up to know better. However, occasional prancing is both fun and an excellent form of cardio.

Having a personality that borderlines caustic, I can assure you that having a little edge is good - it makes you realistic and better able to cope with the fact that sooner or later, everyone gets screwed. That doesn't mean that you should expect the worse out of people and situations. Adulthood means you can cope with whatever comes your way each day.

I mean, happy hour exists for a reason. Good Luck.

Four students with very different backgrounds and lifestyles share one similarity: an addiction. But not the obvious addictions - alcohol, nicotine and drugs. These are addictions that aren't talked about that much, but are all very common within college students.

"I can't live without sex - it's like oxygen to me. I've never felt ashamed of myself, but I do accept that I'm addicted. The most I have gone without sex is one week, and I was ready to kill myself," said junior Maggie Espinoza.

"My weight is 140 pounds and I want to be close to 200. I lift weights every day for about six hours and do little cardio because I don't want to lose any of the muscle I have gained. No matter how long it takes I won't rest until I reach my goal," said sophomore Eduardo Ramirez.

"If I get a B+ in a class, I'm depressed for days. An A is the only acceptable grade for me and my parents; it's been like that since elementary school. I plan on graduating Summa Cum Laude and anything under that would be an embarrassment for my family," said freshman Leena Bauza.

"MySpace has kept me from many social gatherings for the past year. I just prefer to sit in my bed, on my laptop, logged into MySpace than to have go out to a club or something to meet people. It's just my preference," said sophomore Laura Poteli.

Too much of something is never good. This is why it's kind of hard to know when you're addicted to something. This might sound cliché, but it's true: before you seek help you must accept that you have an addiction.

"The first sign of an addiction is when a bodily function that has nothing to do with the addiction begins to suffer. For example, the person who is addicted to working out might get a headache from skipping a day at the gym," said Dahlia Mohammed, a health educator at the Wellness Center. "If the person spends a lot of time thinking of one particular thing or if they deny they have an addiction, they're probably addicted and should get help."

When asked if they were experiencing an addiction, the students, with the exception of Espinoza, denied having a problem.

"I'm not addicted to good grades, but if I don't get one, I'm not happy with myself. I guess this could be a problem, but what can I do about it?" said Bauza.

Bauza is a first generation college student. Her family has high expectations for her and she believes that it's because she has been given so many opportunities to excel in her life, unlike her parents who don't even have a high school diploma and speak little English. 

"My parents don't want me working a low income job like them; they just want me to do the best I can. I remember one time I got a C in biology during middle school and my father flipped out. He went berserk and trapped me in my room for hours. He told me I wouldn't be allowed out and that he had to call my teacher. I'm petrified of him," Bauza said.

Even though Bauza says she is scared of what her father would do if she ever came home with anything less than an A again, she does live at home and refuses to work or join any extracurricular activities because she needs full concentration on her classes.

Unlike Bauza, Espinoza readily agrees that she has an addiction. She realized that she was addicted after having sex for the first time. She had promised herself that she would stay a virgin until she got married, but she considers her urges too powerful.

"It's just too good. Why would I want to end something that feels so amazing? I use protection regularly and I get checked for STDs every three months so I know I'm clean. A lot of my friends tell me that I should stop, that the more I have sex the higher at risk for a disease I am. I am aware of the danger I'm putting myself in. But for now I just want to have fun," she said.

Just because a person gets checked regularly for STDs doesn't necessarily mean that he or she is clean. After a person comes in contact with the HIV virus, it takes a period of two weeks to three months for HIV antibodies to be detectable to any kind of screening, according to Mohammed.

Ramirez doesn't see his obsession with fitness as an addiction, but as a way to better himself. What he doesn't know is that dedicating so much time to one type of fitness is actually hindering his goal.

"I've never really been happy with my appearance. I've always been the skinny, awkward looking kid and I became sick of it once I entered FIU. I attend the gym every morning for three hours before I start classes and three hours every night before the gym closes. I don't even come close to a treadmill or bicycle because what I want are bulging muscles," Ramirez said. "I have considered steroids but I don't want my d--k to shrink."

Ramirez has been working out for close to a year and is not happy with his results. He is set on continuing his workout plan and doesn't think that getting a trainer would help him out.

"I strongly believe in a holistic approach to working out," said Arlen Guerrero, certified fitness trainer at the Recreation Center. "Six hours of working out is way too much; I suggest one to two hours every day and mixing in cardio is a must. Every area of the body should be worked out in order to achieve symmetry of all bodily functions."

Mariela Gabaroni, assistant director of Univeristy Health Services, believes that every person with an addiction has to seek counseling somehow. The Counseling and Psychological Services Center at FIU is a good first step, but if the office doesn't have any programs to help with your specific case, Gabaroni suggests calling the switchboard of Miami at (305) 358-HELP. The switchboard offers to find a group or location that helps with your problem and will tell you whether or not there is a fee for the service you want.

Unlike the rest of the addictions, Poteli's is more of a generational trend. Being addicted to a website doesn't sound like much of a problem, but when the website controls both your social and love life, there's something wrong.

"MySpace is better than any dating service. You get to see many pictures of a person, get to read about their history and get to see what kind of people they hang out with. If I go one day without logging into my profile, I go crazy. I spend hours of my day logged in and update my profile regularly. My parents say I have an addiction, but I just think it's an infatuation," Poteli said.

Mohammed suggests that a good way for Poteli to get away from the computer is by having a party at her house. That way she will be forced to leave the Internet and her friends can keep an eye on her.

If you think you or someone you know is experiencing an addiction, action is necessary. 

"When approaching someone with an addiction avoid using the word addiction. Don't make it accusatory - focus on the resolution," said Seth Grossman, University Psychologist at Counseling and Psychological Services. "We have persons on staff trained to handle various addictions, including Internet and body image addictions."

Author: Rina Lankry / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Campus Life and Events office at BBC, along with its organizations including Student Programming Council, Student Organizations Council and the Student Government Associtation, are hosting a series of events this fall to promote student involvement.

"Attending FIU is not just about getting a degree, it's also about getting a life," according to Larissa Adams, an FIU alumna and assistant at the Wolfe University Center Campus Life and Events office. 

SPC is highlighting Hispanic Heritage with a 10-day series of events beginning Oct. 2. The tentative schedule is posted on the SPC website. 

This year's events will explore the Hispanic cultures not only of Latin America but also of Portugal, Spain and the Isle of Hispaniola, according to Vanessa Robinson, assistant chair for Hispanic Heritage. 

Robinson is planning a Rain Forest Day, which will have a Parrot Jungle presentation and the opportunity for students to take pictures with the animals.

Also there will be performances by Tango dancers, Argentine folklore dancers, Bolivian dancers and a Capoiera demonstration. 

On Oct. 11, SPC is organizing a Dia de los Muertos celebration, a Mexican festival in honor of the dead. There will be a mariachi band, a flower making workshop, giveaways and a shrine to the Golden Panther. 

The most highly anticipated event of the celebration is the Latin Explosion Concert on Oct. 13 featuring performances by "Fulanito" and "Proyecto Uno." The exact location on campus will be posted on the SPC website.

"We're here to boost student morale," said Kenasha Paul, director of Panther Power, which is BBC's spirit organization. Paul also coordinates events to help support Athletics, which includes a dance team called The Golden Charmers, who will be performing Sept. 27 at the next pep rally in Panther Square. On Sept. 22, there will be a Flag Football game in the soccer field, which is basically a party with a DJ, free food and games. 

There will also be a Pajama Jam Party on Oct. 6 and Panther Power is also offering free tickets to the Oct. 14 FIU-UM game.

SPC also puts together Homecoming Week, which is part of the University-wide Spirit Week held Nov. 13-16. Its goal is to promote fun and games through events such as a fashion show and a step show.  There will be a Homecoming Dance Nov. 16 in the WUC Ballroom and a Homecoming Parade.

SOC also oversees all clubs on campus, which are outlets for students to promote their interests such as social, academic, cultural, and religious clubs. 

There are clubs that do community outreach work and fundraising for causes such as the BBC Wish Givers Club that raises money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 

SGA is organizing a Town Hall meeting on the same day-an opportunity for students to voice opinions to BBC Administrators and Student Government.

"We want to know what the students need. We're working for them," said Zachary Trautenberg, BBC SGA comptroller. 

If students are interested in joining SPC in coordinating upcoming events, they can go to the Campus Life office in WUC 155 where they meet every other week at 6 p.m. For more information and details, visit http://wuc.fiu.edu.

Headline: Classes embrace African roots
Author: Shatoria Black / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students at Biscayne Bay Campus can march to the beat of a different drum, thanks to new African dance and drumming classes held on Mondays and Wednesdays at 2 p.m.

Although this isn't the first year the classes are being offered, it is the first year that Abdoulayr Diallo is teaching them.

The African dance class, which has 11 women enrolled and no men, gives students the opportunity to learn challenging moves. 

Despite the intensity, the students are enrolled in the class for different reasons. Some women enrolled in the class as an exercise regimen to lose weight; others wanted to get in touch with their African roots.

An African drumming class follows the African dance class at 3:30 p.m.

Senior Shani Bernard is taking the course for healing purposes.

"I believe in an ancient myth about playing the drums and how it brings healing to the body," said Bernard.

Students have the opportunity to work with drums that are handcrafted by Diallo; however, there are only seven drums for nine students.

According to Diallo, who has been making these drums for over 20 years with materials imported from Africa, the University has not provided him with more drums.

If he were to sell them, he says they would be in the price range of $400 each.

The sound produced by these instruments, which echo through Academic One, is the result of beating the drums with their hands.

"They don't use a stick because the drum is made out of animal skin and it is fragile," said Diallo.

The students will present their moves with a live performance during the first week of November as Art Week.

Headline: Forum addresses University Park traffic concerns
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
In an attempt to strengthen relations with students, the Parking and Transportation Department held a public forum to discuss the lack of parking, parking tickets and decals.

The forum was held on Sept. 13 in the Graham Center and was hosted by the Student Government Association. 

About 30 students attended the forum which began a few minutes behind schedule as Director of Parking and Transportation Bill Foster waited for students to arrive. 

The lack of parking spaces at the University Park campus was a hot topic.  

"Students are just going to have to walk," Foster said.

According to Foster, there are still places to park on campus even when everything seems to be full, such as the lots near the FIU Football Stadium.   

Students also suggested that the University contract an on-campus shuttle to transport them from one end of the campus to the other. 

Foster argued that in order for a shuttle to work the campus roads would have to be widened and shuttle stops would have to be created in order for it to work. 

In the past, there was a similar shuttle service for parking, but it consisted of a single golf cart. 

"The shuttle is not meant to accommodate everyone, but help the problem," Foster said. 

SGA Special Events Coordinator Travis Stokes said that students should learn to make good use of the Miami-Dade public transportation service. 

"We can have a great transit system. Dade has already made vast improvements," Stokes said. 

Other students requested additional parking garages on campus, but Foster said that that idea was impractical due to a lack of space. 

 "Parking isn't sexy," Foster said. 

Constructing new buildings such as the new medical school and the College of Law are the priorities. 

"Parking should never be the focus on campus. Education should be the main focus," Foster said. 

Students also complained that they should not have to pay a parking fee when they don't own a car. 

The access fee helps pay for parking lot lights, maintenance and sidewalks. 

Housing students also wanted additional parking lots, given that there are more housing students than ever due to the new Lakeview residence hall.

Foster argued that the Blue Garage is opened and lit at all times and that most of the students who park there are housing students. 

"We are a growing school," said Student Services Chairperson Wolfgang Acevedo. "If we want FIU to grow then students need to understand what's going on."

The students quickly dispersed after the questions and some said the forum was informative.

"I was very satisfied. [Foster] was very open to suggestions," said sophomore Lewis Cameron.

Headline: SGC tackles low voter registration
Author: Elizabeth Caram / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Last Election Day, an FIU professor ended class two hours early. When she asked the class of over 100 communications students, "How many of you voted," she received an appalling response.

Just one hand slowly rose. The professor, a woman who protested against the Vietnam War, was shocked.

"Get the hell out of here and vote," she said good-naturedly.

The Student Government Council at the Biscayne Bay Campus is doing something about low voter turnout among college students. Its goal: to get 500 students register to vote.

The man behind the effort is junior Brent Maximin, former vice-president of SGC-BBC and current director of student lobbying, which makes him the official liaison between SGA and the United States Student Association, a national student-led coalition that represents millions of students. 

"No one listens to students because we don't vote," Maximin said. "To get the ball rolling, we need to show we care by voting."

He started the initiative to change a pattern in young people across the country have created, they just don't vote. He walks around campus, clutching a clipboard jammed with voter registration forms asking students to register.

Maximin believes his generation of passive college students is doing a disservice to itself by choosing to ignore the voting privilege, because if lawmakers do not care about students' issues now, they will not care later on.

"Some sort of mumble and keep walking and others say they're already registered."

The goal to make 500 students registered voters must be met by Oct. 10, a deadline imposed by the Miami-Dade Elections Department.

So far, Maximin and his fellow volunteers have gotten about 75 students to register. Each week, he drives to the elections department to drop off the forms.

The irony? He can't vote. 

As an international student and Trinidadian, Maximin is not eligible to vote. But that hasn't stopped him from doing what he calls "his civic duty."

"Issues that affect people my age affect me, too," said Maximin

Campus Life Chairperson Daniel Anzueto believes this goal is attainable.

"I definitely do believe that it's something that can be done," said Anzueto. "If we all gather together to vote, then we could make a change to better ourselves and our schools in the future."

Anzueto missed the chance to vote in the presidential elections in 2004 because he was seven days away from his 18th birthday.

"Yeah, that was kind of depressing, especially because the win was by such a small margin," Anzueto said.

Among the students who have taken advantage of the opportunity to become a registered voter is freshman David Luciano, who says he has always believed in the importance of voting.

"I took the opportunity because there aren't too many places where you could just register to vote," said Luciano.

"Education is a right, not a privilege," said Maximin. "This is our chance to [bring] change among students."

Headline: McNair program helps minorities
Author: Yesenia Forte / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
During the summer, the McNair program provided senior Mariana Ceballos with the opportunity to do research at the University of California, San Diego.

"This semester, I plan to apply for grad school to get my Ph.D., and the experience I got will look good on my application," said Ceballos, one of 22 students that were selected this year for the McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program. 

The program was named after Ronald E. McNair who died during the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger Jan. 28, 1986.

The program is intended to help low-income, minority undergraduate students prepare for doctoral studies.

"It was created for the purpose of increasing the number of minorities getting their Ph.D.," said J. Scott Hamilton, the McNair program associate director.

There are over 160 universities throughout the United States involved with the McNair program, but FIU is one of only three in Florida.

Currently in its third year, the McNair program offers student stipends for research, GRE preparation workshops and the chance to represent FIU at national conferences.

Melissa Jahangiri represented FIU in 2005 as the recipient of the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Conference Student Leadership Award for her high grade point average, leadership and campus and community service.  

"This is the first time that a McNair student has won the HENAAC award," Hamilton said. "She is going to do great things with her M.D. Ph.D."

The McNair program also offers help filling out graduate school applications and tutorial assistance.

On Sept. 14 and 15, the FIU McNair program hosted seminars to educate students on the benefits of a graduate education, the best ways to stand out when applying to graduate schools, as well as how to pay for graduate school.

Joseph L. Brown, dean of Student Affairs at Stanford University conducted the seminars and stressed the importance of teacher-student relationships as well as the benefit of recommendation letters when applying to graduate schools.

"It's important to develop a relationship with your professors outside of class," Brown said. "If all they know about you is that you go to class and get A's on you exams and papers, they can't write a good letter for you. Make it a point to visit them once a month and prepare questions to ask them."

Some students at the seminar were unsure about the benefits of attending grad school and asked Brown whether or not the option was a necessary one.

"Well, it depends on your goals…but in some cases like psychology you can't do much with just a BA," Brown said.

Isaac Tourgeman graduated from FIU this summer with a BA in psychology and is currently a McNair member pursuing his Ph.D. in that field.

"I'm studying psychology, so it's part of the process," he said. "I can't be a psychologist without a Ph.D."

The McNair program is only available to students planning to pursue a Ph.D. in science, engineering, technology or math.

Applicants must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 and must be considered low income, first generation college students and/or a member of a minority group.

Students can submit applications throughout the fall semester online at http://mcnair.fiu.edu.

Headline: WITHOUT APPROVAL
Subheadline: SGA recruits for non-existent committees
Author: Angelina Troff / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The University Park Student Government Council is currently recruiting members for its Student Health Advisory Committee and Technology Committee.

The only problem: these committees don't exist, according to the SGA Constitution.

Despite this detail, the committees are already being promoted on the council's revamped web site and flyers have been placed in their office, located in the Graham Center, room 211. 

Two years ago, the Council created the ad-hoc Technology Committee to investigate online fees for students, among other things, according to SGC vice president Providence Okoye.

Article 10, Section A, Part Four of the Constitution allows for ad-hoc committees, which are committees that need to be recreated every year as stated in the Council's bylaws.

At the next Council meeting Sept. 20, Okoye expects the House of Representatives to introduce and pass a bill to create the Student Health Advisory Committee. This committee will be  a link between the students and the University Health Services Complex.

SGC President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon appointed Rebecca Louisdor as the Health Advisory Committee chairperson last summer

However, no bills were passed to create either committee this academic year, which means the committees technically don't exist.

Leon defended the move.

"We are establishing goals," Leon said. "They will get approved."

In another apparent constitutional violation, Leon and Okoye changed the Campus Life chairperson position to a cabinet position.

Article 10, Section A, Part One of the SGA constitution mandates six standing committees (which do not need to be approved annually) within each council,  one of which is Campus Life. This committee, then, must stay a committee.

The Campus Life committee is a separate entity from the Campus Life office.

This move allowed them to circumvent the application process for the chair position, a violation of the bylaws.

Renamed Campus Life Coordinator, Giselle Gutierrez now holds the post.

The SGC bylaws state in Section 5, Part B: "Committee chairpersons will be chosen through an application process and appointed by a simple majority vote of the entire SGA."

Ignoring the bylaws and the constitution, the House approved the position.

Leon said that the Campus Life committee would not have existed as a standing committee if proposed changes to the Constitution had been approved last year.

However, during the general elections in April, these changes were not placed on the ballot and students were not able to vote on the issue.

Despite this, Leon and Okoye chose to introduce the cabinet position.

"Our advisors told us this would be okay," Leon said.

Thatine "Chini" Camargo, graduate assistant for Campus Life and one of the SGA advisors, disagreed with Leon. 

"[Director of Campus Life] Charlie Andrews advised them to get rid of the [Campus Life Chair] as a whole," Camargo said. "They did not take our advice and moved it to the Cabinet.  When an advisor gives a suggestion, this means follow protocol."

Andrews was unavailable for comment.

When asked if she thought SGA realized their actions violated the Constitution, Camargo replied, "They know. If they don't, that's a problem; then something is wrong. They need to re-read the Constitution."

So what happens when SGA breaks its own rules? Nothing without the SGC Judicial Board.

Section 23 of the SGC-UP bylaws outlines the censure and removal process for members who break the rules.

 First, "The basis for the censure or removal of any SGC member … will be referred to Judicial and Mediation Services for review."

This issue could have been addressed during the summer when it was first brought to light, but the Judicial Board's chairperson, Kathryn Cubbon, was out of town.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Judicial Board cannot act without a referral of a violation.

As of Sept. 13, the SGC-UP approved Cubbon's Judicial Board Committee members. Cubbon promised to look into the issue at her first meeting, scheduled for Sept. 18 at 5 p.m., claiming she had not noticed the alleged violations.

"The Judicial Board is not a watchdog," Camargo said. "The Council needs to be aware and the Executive Board needs to hold [its members] responsible."

Students can access the constitution at www.fiu.edu/~sga/Documents.htm.
