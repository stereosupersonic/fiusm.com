Headline: SGA provides newspapers for students
Author: Gosia Darwin/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Student Government Association launched a pilot of The Newspaper Readership Program Oct. 13 on the University Park campus, providing The Miami Herald, The New York Times and USA TODAY to students at no charge Monday through Friday, on calendar school days. 

During the pilot program, the papers are delivered to the UP campus at no cost and placed in open racks. After about a month, the regular program will begin. The papers will be kept in bins equipped with student ID card scanners, to make sure that only FIU students can use the service. The distribution and the card reading machines are provided by the newspapers.

The papers are available at four locations: Graham Center, Green Library, Panther Hall and the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences.

"We allocated $19,989 for those locations," said Alejandra Cordovez, a chairperson of Academic Affairs, who is in charge of the program at UP. "We receive the total of 501 papers, 167 of each title, which are available to students every day." 

The money covers the program at UP until the end of the 2004 Summer A session, and it is coming from the president's reserve discretionary account, said Clayton Solomon, UP Student Government Council president. That account is funded by the activities and service fee paid by students in their tuition, $9.14 per credit hour. 

"This is the time when students can see the fees they pay go directly back to them," Solomon said.

Many students are excited.

"I buy The Miami Herald every morning on my way to school. Now I can pick it up here," said Gabriel Trujillo, a freshman and Business Management major. 

Lindsey Pill-Taylor, junior and chemistry major, is fond of the program, but at the same time she is concerned about the costs. 

"I am an international student and my tuition is very high," she said. "I wouldn't want to see a tuition increase because of this service."

But that will not happen, Cordovez assures. There is enough money coming from the existing student fees to pay for the program. 

All three papers come to FIU at discounted rates: 50 percent off the regular price for The Miami Herald and USA TODAY, and 60 percent off The New York Times street price.

Each month SGA will pay only for copies taken out of the bins. The remaining papers will be picked up at the end of the day and recycled. 

BBC, home to most journalism majors, is supposed to join the program after the pilot stage at UP is over. If that happens, the papers will be available at the Wolfe University Center. 

The source of funding for BBC, however, has not yet been decided. 

Nicaise Parillon, BBC-SGC president, hopes that the money to pay for the program on her campus, roughly $5,000, will come from what was left in last year's budget of the Lectures Committee, a university-wide account.  

Solomon at UP suggests sponsorship from the Academic Affairs department.

The Newspaper Readership Program is popular across the country, and was pioneered by Pennsylvania State University in 1997, according to PSU's official website. 

The idea was soon adopted by number of colleges, and today about 250 take advantage of the program, choosing the papers that are most demanded by their students.

"[Members of UP-SGC] found out about it and we thought it was a great idea," Solomon said. They conducted a survey among about 300 students at UP to see what their newspaper reading habits were. 

The survey asked students which papers they read and how often. It also asked whether students would read the papers if free copies were available. 

Based on that data, the UP-SGC chose the three papers. 

The survey was also intended to measure students' familiarity with the current events in their community and their country. 

"Every student knows who the 'American Idol' winner is, but they don't know who their attorney general is," Solomon said. 

He hopes that the program will raise cultural, community and political awareness, which will benefit students in the long run.

"That's important for student government, because we try to get people to vote in elections," Solomon said. "Only then, students will have political power that will prevent tuition increase and save scholarships."

The participating papers also see the big picture. 

"Our overall goals are to stimulate critical thinking and promote life-long learning," said Scott Brown, the educational manager of the southeast division of The New York Times, one of the partners in the program. "We want to encourage responsible citizenship." 

The New York Times contributes to the Newspaper Readership Program in about 180 colleges across the country, Brown said. 

But the papers also view the program as a long time investment. 

"We hope that students will develop life-long reading habit of the newspaper," said Vannetta Bailey-Iddrisu, the manager of Educational Services at The Miami Herald. The paper has been participating in a similar readership program at the University of Miami since 2001. 

USA TODAY, apart from providing its own newspapers, is also managing and coordinating day-to-day operations of the program for FIU. 

"Most of the programs we are involved in country-wide; we also manage," said Diane Harris, senior accounting manager at the paper's South Florida division. "It makes it easier for the universities and for our partners."  

Their employees handle billing and campus distribution of all participating newspapers. They also collect the remaining copies for recycling. 

Although faculty and staff will not be able to pick up the free papers after the student ID card scanners are in place, UP-SGC is expecting that teachers will take advantage of the program.	

"We want the teachers to somehow incorporate the newspapers into the curriculum," Solomon said. "So that they encourage students even more to take advantage of that service."

Headline: Internship programs expose students to professional world
Author: Carolina Sarassa/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Many students wonder about whether or not they will find the job of their expectations when they graduate. One way to start getting involved and gaining ground experience is by participating in an internship program.

FIU's Career Services Department defines an internship "as an experience that will afford you priceless opportunities to explore career options." Getting an internship is a great way to make connections, do better in school, and students are more likely to start with higher salaries when they have had previous experience.

Internships are designed to provide students with work related to their field of study prior to graduation. Although some internships are either paid or awarded class credits, most students get involved to get some experience and to make more informed decisions about their career.

According to Claudia Reich, Career Consultant at Career Services, an internship is recommended to all students. She says that when it gets to the point of who gets the job, the recruiter is more likely to hire the person with the most experience rather that the person with the highest G.P.A. 

"I encourage students to join Panther Link and get involved in clubs," Claudia says. "They have a much greater chance of getting hired."

"It is a great idea for students to get internships because it is a direct exposure in their profession," said Jaime Canaves, director of Research at the School of Architecture and Interior Design. "In an internship, the student learns what cannot be taught at school."

Students can start seeking internships as early as in their freshman year, but typically it is done in their junior or senior year or in graduate school. It is not impossible to get an internship, but you have to apply and follow up with your updated resume and interviews.

Some students assume only connections will land you an internship.

"You have to be friends with a professor to get an internship," said TV production major Carmen Ayala.

But this is not necessarily the case, FIU provides students with these services. 

Internships are the first step to get involved in the "real world" of your field of study. Career Services encourages students to try to obtain one even if it is not a requirement. 

For some majors like architecture, an internship is a requirement. Canaves explained that if a student does not complete two years of interning, he or she cannot get a license.

For other majors, even though is not mandatory, it is highly advised. 

"It is not only having a diploma in let's say journalism. To get a good job you must show some previous work you have done to demonstrate your skills," said Michael Duarte, freelance writer for the Sun-Sentinel. 

On the other hand, programs such as TESOL (Teaching English as a Second Language) provide hands-on experience that may make it unnecessary for students to participate in an internship program. 

"I do not advise my students to get internships in this master's program because they do other things as field assignments," said Aixa Perez, assistant professor of The foundation / Prof. Studies Department. 

The Political Science Department does not require internships, but it offers them such as judicial internships. 

"In political science, it is not a requirement but an option to gain practical experience," said Christopher L. Warren, associate professor of Political Science. 

 Involvement in the job market while in school can be an advantage for students. Many internships result in a permanent position at the company. 

"I started working as an intern in a firm doing some accounting, and after I finished the internship, a position opened and guess who got the job," said Marcos Villaverde, a junior and accounting major, "they gave me the job."

Many students believe an internship is a great opportunity, but don't know how to get one.

"I am a psychology major, and I'll love to intern, but I do not know how," said Juliana Orozco, a sophomore in the program. 

To that end, Career Services at both campuses sponsors career and internship fairs throughout the school year.

Headline: Sororities hold candy drive for local youth
Author: Erika Taveras/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Alpha Xi Delta and Alpha Omicron Pi chapters at FIU will be organizing a Halloween candy drive for children this year.  Both sororities will be collecting individually wrapped candy and money donations in the Graham Center from Oct. 28 until Oct. 30.

Once all the candy is collected, the sorority members will make little Halloween treat bags to  give to approxiametely 60 children at Guardian Sheperd Lutheran Christian Day School, a local, private elementary school, on Oct. 31. 

The sorority members also plan on engaging in all kinds of fun activities with the kids on the day of the visit. They will play with the children for about an hour at the school's playground.  

Greek organizations have a philanthropy, or cause they raise money for. Alpha Xi Delta has Choose Children, the philanthropic notion adopted by the Alpha Xi Delta sorority nationwide, which focuses on youth welfare. 

"People think that sororities are just an excuse to party, but my experiences with Greek life here at FIU have been different," said Adriana Pereira, vice president of Public Relations for Alpha Xi Delta.  "Philanthropy and service is a huge part of my sorority.  Almost every event we host is to raise money for Choose Children."  

The money that is collected will in part be used to finish buying any candy or supplies needed for the event, and the rest will goes towards their philanthropy. 

There is the misconception that Greeks do not get along or come together to host events like this one, according to Pereira. 

But she feels that the Halloween drive will serve as an example of the unity and participation amongst Greek organizations and FIU students in general.  

This is the first time that her sorority will hold an event like this, and they are hoping for a very successful outcome due to all the active members participating in the drive. The approximately 97 Alpha Xi Delta members this semester are looking forward to collaborating with members of Alpha Omicron Pi. 

"We are very happy to be working with Alpha Omicron Pi because they are a great group of ladies and although their sorority is very young on our campus, they have worked very hard during their time here at FIU and they have earned all of our respect," said Pereira.  She also stressed the importance of all FIU students donating for the drive, because the events they hold are not limited just to Greek societies. 

Though the other sorority participating in the candy drive, Alpha Omicron Pi, specifically supports adult and juvenile arthritis research as its philanthropy, Kenya Tom, the sorority's philanthropy chair said, "We care about everyone!"  

Tom thinks the candy drive is important not only because it is for a good cause, but also because it reinforces the concept of Greek unity.

 "This event is also a way to promote Greek unity because in the end we are all serving similar purposes in our communities," Tom said.  

 Karen Katz, assistant director of Campus Life and Greek Affairs, also places an emphasis on Greek unity.  She said that sororities and fraternities coming together to perform community service and philanthropic events like this one, greatly represent FIU and demonstrate the union of the various organizations.  In addition, she added that FIU has received various awards due to the great quality that Greeks and students possess when hosting all the different kinds of events.

Headline: Visa process frustrates international students in United States
Author: Peter Delevett/ Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Abtin Keshavarzian can't go home.

The young Iranian living in Palo Alto, Calif., hasn't seen his parents and sister in Tehran, Iran, for more than two years. But visiting them could trigger a six-month wait before he could return to the United States _ if he could return at all.

"It's high-risk," said Keshavarzian, 25.

Keshavarzian isn't a criminal. Nor is he in this country illegally. He's a top engineering student at Stanford University. And he's one of tens of thousands of students nationwide caught up in new State Department rules enacted in the name of national security after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Students _ and all other visitors from dozens of countries _ must undergo new background checks and more wide-ranging interviews by U.S. consulates before they can get a visa to travel here. That process can take months, causing some students to miss semesters of school.

Foreign students who leave the country for family emergencies, to present papers at scholarly conferences or for any other reason, have to start the process all over again.

"We are denying ourselves some of the world's most talented young people," said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education. He said many of the students snared in the new red tape are studying science and technology. "It's in the national interest to attract the best and brightest from around the world."

The council estimates that half a million foreign students come to study in the United States each year. As many as 50,000 of them _ particularly those from China, Taiwan, the Middle East, India and Pakistan _ are facing some form of visa limbo like Keshavarzian.

"I have yet to come across a student from Europe having difficulty," said Gillian August-Thorp, director of international student services at Santa Clara University.

The visa policy _ which devotes closer scrutiny to students from countries thought to harbor terrorists and to those studying fields that affect national security _ has rattled campuses across the country. And the students are torn between their studies and their roots.

State Department spokesman Stuart Patt said the agency understands the new burdens put on students. In many cases, he said, consular officers are instructed to put students at the top of the visa waiting list.

At the same time, he said, "The interests of national security are primary."

Exact numbers of those affected are hard to pin down, but Stanford and San Jose State universities estimate a few dozen of their foreign students are bogged down in the visa morass. Santa Clara University reports that this fall, two students from India and one from Taiwan had to defer admission until next year after hitting visa snags.

"It is absolutely a problem," said James Plummer, Stanford engineering dean. "I get e-mails from students in China and other places who are in a panic because they can't get a visa."

Then there are students such as Keshavarzian, who are fine so long as they don't leave the United States. The engineering student knows of one classmate who had to choose between attending her father's funeral in Iran and risking a lengthy delay in her studies. She attended the funeral and was able to return to Stanford after about a month, he said.

Another Stanford student caught up in the snarl is Yang Wang, who is working toward a graduate degree in civil engineering. Feeling homesick, he went to his native China in December. He remains there, unable to return to study or even claim his belongings.

In an e-mail, Wang said he understood the need for more visa scrutiny and appreciates efforts to speed the review process.

"However, the current check system is still not satisfying enough and is still stranding a lot of innocent students for an unreasonably lengthy time," he wrote.

Patt said most student visas are processed within three weeks. But those who want to study science or technology _ like most of the foreign students who come to Silicon Valley _ undergo additional background checks by national security experts.

On top of that, students from a handful of other countries _ including China and countries believed to sponsor terrorism _ can take months longer to clear.

"An Iranian person is going to have particular problems because he's Iranian," Patt said. "If he's studying electrical engineering, he would have quite possibly a wait of many months."

That distinction frustrates Sina Zahedi, 27, an Iranian who's studying information theory at Stanford.

The clearance checks don't stop once students reach the states. Zahedi said he was offered a summer job at Bell Labs but was delayed by months of government background checks and ultimately had to turn it down. His friend Reza, who didn't want his last name printed for fear of reprisals back home, reported the same experience after getting an offer from Mountain View, Calif., chip-maker Nvidia.

Students and educators say the visa interview process can be arbitrary. Reza said he went through three interviews in three countries before a consular official finally approved him. (Because the United States doesn't have diplomatic relations with Iran, Iranian students have to travel at their own expense to another country for visa vetting.)

"Obviously colleges and universities want to take all appropriate actions, but we also want a process that is transparent and coherent," said Hartle, whose group represents 1,800 colleges and universities.

He also worries that the harder it is for foreign students to come to the United States, the more appealing universities in countries such as Australia, Britain and South Africa appear. That could lead to a university brain drain and hurt the U.S. economy, he said.

Indeed, Stanford students and employees say that last year about a half-dozen foreign students waiting for visas gave up and applied to schools in other countries.

Reza, who is studying chip design, now advises friends back home to study in Europe or Canada. "It's not worth the hassle," he said gloomily. "I'm kind of sick of this."

Headline: Soaring college tuition causes political debate
Author: Robert Dodge /Dallas Morning News
&nbsp;
The cost of a college education, which has risen steadily for a decade, soared for the 2003-04 school year. And now, it is becoming a political issue.

A new report issued Tuesday showed that average tuition and fees at four-year public colleges rose 14 percent, to $4,694. Similarly, costs at two-year public schools rose 13.8 percent, to $1,095.

And at private universities, where costs run higher, prices rose 6 percent, to $19,710.

The College Board, an association of colleges and universities that issued the report, blamed the economy and a shortfall of federal and state revenues. The group said many students have been protected from tuition hikes by the growing availability of financial aid.

Even so, the latest figures took on a political charge as Republicans accused colleges and universities of wasting taxpayer funds on lavish campus facilities. Among those cited were large hot tubs, sunbathing decks and massage facilities, as well as a rock-climbing wall at a recreation center at the University of Houston.

Elwyn Lee, vice president for student affairs at the University of Houston, objected to his school's 264,000-square-foot, $53 million recreation center being used as an example of college largesse. He said the facility was built at student request and is being financed with a $75-a-semester fee.

"There are no massage parlors. There are no pedicure places in our facility," Lee said. "Some people are speaking and letting their enthusiasm get away from them."

But Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said colleges and universities have not been held accountable for such spending.

"Hyperinflation in college costs has been pummeling parents and students for more than a decade, and the problem has not been a lack of spending by states or the federal government," he said. "The bigger issue is whether institutions are accountable enough to parents, students and taxpayers, and clearly they are not."

College Board officials said schools have taken steps to tighten their belts as the recession shrunk tax revenues. While they were reluctant to forecast future trends, they noted that college tuition and fees also had escalated during earlier recessions.

"It is a problem, (but) it is not an unprecedented problem," said Sandy Baum, an economics professor at Skidmore College, who wrote the board's annual "Trends in College Pricing."

In blaming the trend on tax revenue shortfalls, university officials tapped into Republican angst about being accused of under-funding public education in advance of next year's presidential election.

Democrats used the report to accuse Republicans of draining education coffers to pay for President Bush's tax cuts.

"Republican tax and budget cuts have hurt students by forcing states to raise tuition," said Rep. George Miller of California, the ranking Democrat on the House education committee.

Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board, warned against initiatives that would limit the ability of institutions to freely set tuition and fees. But Boehner has praised a bill introduced by Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif., that would allow the federal government to cut off federal subsidies to institutions that repeatedly impose "exorbitant" tuition increases.

Daniel Langan, an Education Department spokesman, said the Bush administration would take a serious look at McKeon's proposal. And he accused critics of using "inflammatory rhetoric," noting the administration's 2004 budget would boost funds for grants, loans and work-study opportunities by $2.8 billion.

The College Board report showed that during the last decade, tuition and fees rose 47 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis at four-year public universities and 22 percent at two-year public schools. Cost at private universities rose 42 percent.

Despite the increases, college officials said they are struggling.

"All of us need to focus on the mounting and troubling hardships of financing an education," said Caperton, who is a former Democratic governor of West Virginia. 

David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, said reduced earnings on endowments and fewer financial gifts by alumni and corporations also contributed to funding shortages.

"We are in the middle of a very difficult period in financing higher education," he said.

College Board officials said that a dip in room and board costs at both public and private schools helped moderate the tuition hikes.

They also said the effects of tuition and fee hikes were less burdensome on student pocketbooks because almost 60 percent of undergraduates receive financial aid. They said financial aid has been rising to further soften the blow.

Statistics for student aid are a year behind tuition and fees.

During the 2002-03 school year, total financial aid rose to $105 billion, up 14.5 percent over the previous year. And during the past decade, financial aid rose 203 percent, up from $34 billion in the 1992-93 academic year.

College Board officials said that financial aid left the "average student" well positioned to absorb increased costs. 

But they acknowledged that 40 percent of students receive no aid and have to shoulder the additional expense.

Headline: Editorial: Fans need to show support for FIU athletic programs
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
When the Florida Marlins started their season, they toiled under the stadium lights, but never under the spotlight. The organization, facing contraction after years of sparse attendance, was in the hot seat, but no fans were in the seats. Now, only months later, the Marlins are in the World Series, and fans are crowding the bandwagon.

That's a recurring theme in fickle-fan Miami: If your team doesn't win, the fans don't come.

And it isn't any different at FIU. In fact, maybe it's worse. You see, at FIU, even if a team wins the fans are nowhere to be found.

Back in January, the men's soccer team, traditionally the most successful team at FIU, was nearly terminated even after they made it to the second round of the NCAA championship. After many complaints and community outrage, the program was given a stay of execution, and granted two years to put more fans in the seats.

This year, they are one of the 10 best teams in the nation. But if you think that's helped their attendance, you'd be wrong. Their last home game against James Madison hosted only 205 fans. They won, by the way, by a score of 4-1.

Men's baseball has also been a traditionally competitive team. If you're new to the Marlins' bandwagon, you might not know that Mike Lowell, the all-star third baseman, was once a Golden Panther.
The baseball team's average attendance last season? 330.

The FIU community rejoiced when it was announced that we had finally, after years of fighting, been granted a football program. In their first season, they posted a 5-6 record, very respectable for a first year program. They averaged 9,453 fans per home game that season in a stadium that seats up to 17,800 spectators.

This season, their second, the young program is off to a bad start, only to be expected from a program at this stage in development. And attendance is down even further: 9,073 per home game.

What does that say to potential recruits? What does that say about the student body's commitment to this program's future? 

Keep in mind that the one-time-national-championship-contending men's soccer team was once the jewel in FIU athletics' crown. Years of student apathy nearly destroyed that legacy, which even now is still in the balance.

These are our programs. But if the students don't show they want them, then they shouldn't be surprised to find one day that these programs aren't here anymore.

Headline: Dating should be color blind
Author: Yasmine Abellard/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
As a young girl raised in Haiti, I attended an all-girls private institution, and did not know the meaning of "co-ed" until I entered a college prep school in Florida at nine-years-old. I also did not know that for the next eight years at my new school - this time surrounded by boys - liking or even wanting to date a guy whose skin pigmentation was significantly lighter than mine, was considered taboo. I figured this issue would be irrelevant once I entered college, but surprisingly, not much has changed as I'm nearing graduation. 

After years of frustration, I set out to interview several FIU students of various cultural backgrounds, to tell me their take on the relevance of skin color when it comes to their significant other. 

Neudy Nuñez, a junior and international business major, says, "When it comes to me dating, or even friendship, or anything, the color of a person's skin is just a color... they're a person, I'm a person, we're just different shades." 

Although Nuñez, a native of Venezuela, places no importance on color, she believes that interracial dating is still held as taboo as she mentions a situation in which all eyes were on her and a former boyfriend, who she describes as being "very dark" compared to her tanned skin, while promenading at a popular college-hangout in Miami. 

Nuñez wasn't so much concerned about the stares as she was about her parents. "It's sad to say because they're my parents, but they see being black as something bad because of stereotypes." Nuñez adds that the following stereotypes contribute to continual disapproval of her dating choices: "white people are rich, white people have more money, white people have power; black people are poor, black people are dirty, [and] lazy." 

Nuñez has tried to comprehend why society values racial color as a deciding factor when it comes to dating. She simply believes that, "it's pure ignorance. People want to be attached to a belief - each one to their own I guess - and it shouldn't be like that."

Bill Wilson, a finance and MIS major, doesn't believe that interracial dating is regarded as the unforgivable sin in today's millennial age. The twenty-one-year-old Miami native of Irish-American descent, says, "I believe here in Miami, we have such a broad and diverse population, that, when you see persons of different ethnicities and backgrounds together, there's no question of whether it is right or wrong." 

However, Wilson feels that parents play a strong role when it comes to their children's dating relationships. "I saw it where parents weren't too thrilled about their sons or daughters dating someone of another race, or different ethnic background." 

Wilson, who considers himself "very lucky" to have had non-discriminating parents, says that instead of color, dating is about personality.

One student, a junior of West Indian background, doesn't place importance on racial color when it comes to dating. His parents however, aren't as open-minded. "There were no fears about what my peers would think or what strangers would think. There was however much concern about what my parents would think. Thoughts about how they would not approve of me dating outside of my race."

The self-described Caribbean islander believes that, "People of different races try to preserve their own culture by dating and marrying people with similar background. So when they see someone of their own race marrying and even dating someone of another race, they often frown upon this decision because they feel that person is "selling out."

He also presents a beauty versus color factor, as he mentions a widely held belief in which persons of certain racial color groups possessing "good" features are innately viewed as more attractive than those with "bad" features. He says, "If you look at the American society you will be able to see this." 

He uses models Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks as examples. "Tyra Banks is preferred by most American men because of her lighter complexion, long straight hair, and up-class body. Naomi is not as preferred as Tyra because of the darkness of her skin."

Friends and classmates have often wondered why, in this so-called equal opportunity society we live in, I was often hesitant to approach a potential beau whose skin color did not conveniently match mine. 

It is not because I considered the action a faux pas, but rather because I was aware of society's desire to maintain racial disunity when it came to dating relationships. The belief that two individuals engaged in a relationship must remain in the same color pool was acknowledged and accepted as the norm.  

I hope that, perhaps some day, the color of my skin will not be used as a logical reason to determine my romantic compatibility, nor be used as a means to define my character. I hope that it will be seen for what it is - just a color.

Headline: In Response: Columnist's arguments insulting, irrational
Author: Julianne Liberty/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
If Andy Diaz was trying to show his superiority over extra-chromosome right-wing, critics like Drew Mallo, it was, as he mentioned in his Oct. 14 column, no great feat. 

Maybe he'd just run out of fresh ideas and needed an easy way to make his deadline, but the personal insults to Mallo demonstrate the very weakness that Diaz assailed his opponent for, even questioning his IQ and (practically) his parentage. (If it is ignorance and ungrammatical writing he is concerned about, Diaz need look no further than the front page of The Beacon.) 

In the course of accusing Mallo of ignorance, hate and intolerance, our crusading journalist illustrates his own ignorance, hatefulness and intolerance. His column was, to borrow a term from the liberal lexicon, "mean-spirited." Of course, any criticism of liberal orthodoxy is denounced by the left as mean, stupid, and intolerant, thus relieving them of the burden of actual debate. 

Not that liberals are utterly bereft of hatred-It's pathetic that if Bush wasn't there to kick around, The Beacon would have no editorial page to speak of, which is not just "mean-spirited," but useless, and I think most of us who read The Beacon tune out week after week of these pot shots at the president. 

If Diaz is eager to attack Mallo for being irrational, let's see what passes for logical debate with him (besides setting up a straw man and bravely knocking him down.) 

We learn that Bush should have been able to look through his crystal ball and predict Sept. 11 - never mind that You-Know-Who had been in power for eight years before the attacks and that this country had been out to lunch during that period, reaping the bogus benefits of the post Cold-War "Peace Dividend," and it showed in the leadership of our country. Never mind that our former chief executive's idea of military operations included bombing aspirin factories in Sudan. This likely would have been the response of a president Gore. Sure, the Bush administration's response to Sept. 11 leaves much to be desired, but Mallo correctly points out that a president Gore wouldn't have declared a War on Terror. 

It's amazing that Diaz feels justified in bashing Mallo with personal insults (although calling your opponent stupid is standard operating procedure in the liberal play book.) It is revealing of the mind set of the political left that if you disagree with them you are not simply wrong or stupid, but evil. You are a blight upon humanity, which must be rescued by the self-anointed likes of Mr. Diaz.

Headline: Beirut was America's intro to terrorism
Author: Ted Randall/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
America met the angry, sinister specter of terrorism long before the destruction of the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon attack, and an airliner crash in a lonely field in Pennsylvania.  

In October of 1983, 241 U.S. servicemen died in what was, at the time, the worst single terrorist attack against Americans.  

The mission of the Marine Corps is to aggressively locate, close-with, and destroy the enemy by fire and maneuver, however; that was not the case for approximately 1,600 Marines deployed ashore in Beirut, Lebanon as members of a multi-national peace keeping force in October of 1983.  

After marines had evacuated hundreds of Palestinians from Lebanon in 1982, the fighting leathernecks were assigned peacekeeping duties in Beirut.  

Forced to operate in a defensive mode and restrained by precarious rules of engagement, Marines were assigned the task of restoring peace and order in a nation torn apart by years of civil war. 

Their mission soon became mired in political quibbling. Politicians in Washington, D.C. continued to deny Marines the safety of loaded weapons.  

Eventually, the inevitable happened.  In the early morning hours of Oct. 23, 1983, a truck, driven by a crazed member of the Hezbollah and loaded with 2,000 pounds of compressed-gas-enhanced explosives breached the security perimeter surrounding the Marine Barracks.  

In an instant, a nuclear-like blast of flame and smoke consumed 241 Marines, Sailors, and Soldiers.  Perished.  Gone forever.   Oct. 23, 2003 marks the 20th anniversary of the Beirut bombing.  

There will be an anniversary gathering at Camp Lejeune, N.C. where family members and fellow Marines will remember and honor those who lost their lives.  

They will gather beneath the Carolina Pines at a granite wall guarded by a life-sized bronze statute of a U.S. Marine and reflect on the names that are engraved there.  

Sons and daughters who were just children when their fathers perished have families of their own now.  

Captains and sergeants who led those Marines and survived are retired.  

But the pain and loss will not subside.  They will always remember, as we must remember that peace must prevail so that others may be spared the agony of such sorrow.   

Semper-Fidelis.

Corrections on Dominican-American Student Association article 

To the Editor: 

I am always excited to see what else is The Beacon going to come up with. I love reading the newspaper because since all of my classes are at BBC, it maintains me informed of what's going on all over FIU, which seems to be at University Park, but that's another issue, right?

I was reading the front page headlines and came across, 'DASO offers taste of Dominican culture'; being Dominican I was automatically flipping to page four to see what they have to say about my culture. To my amazement, I find words misspelled and that completely mean something else or don't mean a thing, at least to us Dominicans.

First of all, our music is not called "meringue," it's merengue and we don't drink "monir soñando," we drink morir soñando.

I didn't even finish reading the article. Don't get me wrong, I like The Beacon and I think pretty good articles are published on every issue, but I just had to get that out of my chest. 
It's my culture and mistakes like that bother me. I'm sure it would bother you if similar mistakes were made in an article about your culture.

I just think more careful editing has to be done. 

Being a regular Beacon reader I have found similar mistakes and even grammar errors, I guess when you take the grammar test so many times, it kind of sticks to you. Thank you.

Give credit where credit is due: Student Football Committee 

To the Editor:

Since March 2003, Student Government allocated special funds for the Student Football committee for the FIU football season 2003. Manny Rosa and I have been having weekly meetings building a united front in support for football. Reading this article, made me feel like all the work being done by us was infinitesimal. 

We took the time to find an elaborate plan to have different organizations hosting each game, and giving them the ideas for a great attendance turnout. 

The Beacon should pride itself in its journalistic integrity, and for this I shall correct some mistakes that were made. I read The Beacon many times, and a lot of mistakes are said about most of our organizations, but when I read this article I was perturbed because our committee worked hard to make this year the best, and when credit is finally given, it's given to the wrong department. 

Athletics has given 5,000 Papa John's pizza coupons every game. Yet, the student football committee has hosted every tailgate event, and has been mass promoting along with Panther Rage; both organizations sponsored by Student Government. 

We assigned different organizations to every football game, and Student Football committee created the Golden Panther Cup (an award given each game to the organization with the most attendance.) 

That nice golden trophy that was mentioned was also financially sponsored and created by the football committee. 

 "Lot 6" dancer are a great idea, and are also sponsored by the Student Football committee. 

While credit is due to the Greeks, there also should be credit given to Panther Rage, SPC, SGA, and the Homecoming Council for the great attendance and support for football. 

Overall, the student newspaper should really try its best to give the facts to the students of FIU, and simple mistakes like these should be prevented. 

Our only motivation of working is by getting credit for our successful events. 

If there are any questions whatsoever about a campus life events, please feel free to contact Campus Life to find out the correct person to speak to so this incident will not occur again.

Edwin Perez,

Student Football Committee

Headline: Students rally to save Bright Futures
Author: By Maria Merzeau/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In an effort to maintain the continuation of the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program, more than 450 FIU students attended a rally hosted by the Student Government Association in University Park on Oct 16. 

At the rally the students were asked to sign a banner in order to show the support in keeping Bright Futures, the banner will be presented in Tallahassee.

"Today, Bright Futures teach our best and brighter students in the State by providing scholarships, to almost 100,000 students, 76 percent of whom show financial need, '' Clayton Solomon, University Park President, said. "This year over $8 million was given to Bright Futures FIU students.''

Founded in 1997, Bright Futures rewards students for their high school academic achievements enabling them to attend a community college or public university. 

Over 5,000 FIU students have Bright Futures scholarships, according to student government statistics. 

Sen. Ken Pruitt, the keynote speaker at the rally, is in the process of traveling around Florida in a 50-foot minibus to each state university, making sure that the students know that their scholarship and their access to a higher education is in jeopardy. 

Pruitt complimented Solomon on the turnout. 

''He kept his promise, he said that FIU would bring out more students than any other university, and FIU did, this is the best showing that we've had,'' Pruitt said. 

According to Pruitt, some legislators are considering making budget cuts of $5 or $10 million in order to balance the state budget.

''We are going to make sure that Tallahassee keeps its promises and commitments. '' Pruitt said. '' We are not going to let them take the dream away, this is about hope, opportunity, and prosperity. '''

The senator mentioned "last year, there was an attempt to cut Bright Futures and to eliminate it from many families.'' The students who at that time were at risk where the ones whose families earned more than $75,000 per year, according to Priutt. 

''We were able to stopped it last year, but it sent a warning sign out to all of us that there would be another attempt this year, because they are trying to balance the budget on the back of parents and students.'' Pruitt said. 

Phillip Hamilton, a 20-year-old public relations major who works as a student government assistant, said that Bright Futures pays 75 percent of his tuition. 

''If this is taken away that's a lot of money I would have to pay, it would be very hard," he said.  

According to Justin Fahringer, UP Student Government Council director of Legislative Affairs, the students most at risk are the ones who are making just enough money on their own, but do not qualify for financial aid.

''[Bright Futures] is always in jeopardy, thanks to criticism that scholarships get awarded to students who can actually pay for college on their own. With Bright Futures, students can be involved in other things on campus,'' Fahringer said. 

Solomon is hoping that after the rally the students would make an effort in sending e-mails, letters or making calls to their legislators letting them know that they want to keep their scholarships. 

Many students are worried about losing their scholarship.  

Ola Okache, a political science sophomore, who is a student government intern, said Bright Futures pays 100 percent of her tuition. '' If they eliminate the scholarship, I wouldn't be able to pay for tuition, I would have to get a job, ask my parents for help, or get a loan,'' she said.

Another concerned FIU student is freshman and english major Maria Virginia Deliz. She was awarded the Bright Futures Scholarship after her good grades in High School and her good scores on the SATs.

''I don't work so I can dedicate more time to school, she said. "Without the scholarship, I wouldn't be able to pay for it, and I would have to get a loan, so my parents could pay for the loan." 

Also Jacqueline Ginarte, a 19-year-old business major, who works as a student government representative, said that Bright Futures pays 75 percent of her tuition. 

''I think that if they cut the scholarship I would be affected along with many students. Without the scholarship I wouldn't be able to pay for school, and my parents would have to pay for tuition, '' she said.

Headline: Council of 100 members raise funds for FIU
Author: Yudy Pineiro/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Council of 100 is a group made up of business and civic leaders with several goals in mind: promoting FIU academic programs, offering financial support, recruiting community leaders to the council, and contributing to strategic university plans through dialogue.

The council was formed in 1991 under the University President Modesto A. Maidique with an idea to help integrate the university with the community.

"We feel that we're part of the university governance whose goals are to interact with the community and promote the university," said Jeffrey Horstmyer, chairman of the Council of 100, "We're also partly ambassadors and in addition to our ambassadorial role, we have a service program where we go out to high schools and educate the students about the university."

The Council of 100 is currently made up of 45 members, a drop from its usual 100.  Some former council members have moved on to higher positions within the FIU community such as the board of directors, or Board of Trustees, leaving the council with a need to recruit.

"Our number one goal now is membership," said George Corton, coordinator of University Admissions & Alumni Affairs.

Corton says the council plans to undergo and "internal revamping" with a focus on recruiting new members. He believes that South Florida business leaders should be interested in supporting FIU since, "we are a major hiring pool for them."  

Horstmyer said that often times FIU students end up working with some of the businesses and community leaders involved with the council.

"We hire a tremendous amount of people from FIU," said Steven Berwick, Steering Committee member for the FIU Council of 100 and partner at Kaufman, Rossin & Co., "We have about 150 employees and a lot of them are FIU grads."

He also added that they don't really recruit at FIU, it just turns out that way.

"The members of the council are nominated by either the president of the university or myself, but anybody can bring us a name of a person they think is qualified," said Horstmyer adding that most of the time the members are recruited by other members or university officials. 

The Council of 100 mirrors, at least strategically, the mission of the university. 

"The Council of 100 is influential business men within the community that serve with the council in support of the mission of the university," said Heide K. Dans, coordinator of donor relations.

 At the turn of the century FIU released "The Millennium Strategic Plan" detailing the future goals for the university.  The plan states a list of six strategic themes which include:  International, Environment, Florida and Local Economic Development, Health, Arts-Culture-and Diversity, and Learning Opportunties.

"In line with that we looked at what [six key] industries in the city we would like to identify that would help promote these themes.  [Now] we're in the process of nominating leaders to head subcommittees from those key industries," said Horstmyer.

He also added, "We're not simply focusing on those key areas, we also want to be inclusive on all areas of professional, and business as well as leaders within the community."

Dans says as a reminder that the Council of 100 is not related to any other board.

"It gives an opportunity for people that are members of other councils the opportunity to join this one too," said Dans.

Throughout the years, the council has raised more than $1 million with the support of over 200 community leaders. The money stems from the $1,500 annual membership fees.  One thousand dollars goes to FIU's unrestricted funds, which includes programs, scholarships, or department needs.

"Unrestricted funds fill an urgent need and it's not part of an existing budget," said John S. Engen, Associate Vice President for Development.

 The other $500 is raised to carry out the councils' two major initiatives:  the Outstanding Faculty Award and the Top Student Recruitment Program. The Outstanding Faculty Award is a $10,000 grant presented annually to a faculty member who exemplifies excellence in teaching, research and service.  The Top Student Recruitment Program is intended to reach out to future FIU students and their teachers through Council of 100 sponsored activities.  This program also works closely with the Office of Admissions and the Honors College to recruit Honors College students.

Corton believes that in order to understand the relationship of the business world with a public institution; you must first, "think about Miami-Dade without a public institution like FIU.  It would not be the dynamic, thriving community it is now. We're going to tap someone that understands the importance of public education," said Corton, "[FIU is] the vehicle for the American dream in Miami."

Headline: Conservative activist Brown accuses universities of stifling free speech
Author: Vanessa Gomez/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In a speech entitled "Why the Left Hates Freedom of Speech," conservative activist Floyd Brown said "Free speech is ugly. Free speech is hurtful."

The premise of the lecture, delivered on Oct. 15 at University Park, was to make attendees aware of the disparity in the freedom of expression allowed to protestors or activists in university campuses based on what that person or group is advocating.

Brown argues that conservative's free speech rights are constantly being trampled on, while liberals are left to express their views unfettered. 

"What we need is counter-speech; I don't believe in any restrictions whatsoever in free speech," said Brown."Your rights on campus should be incredibly broad."

The event was sponsored by the American Conservative Student Union, whose goal is "to assist in the exposition and promotion of conservative principles and ideas in society," according to its constitution.

Brown's resume is lengthy and extensive. A political pundit, he has written several books and contributed newspaper columns. He has appeared on Politically Incorrect, CBS Evening News, MSNBC and FOX News. He is a board member of the American Conservative Union, serves as chairman of the research and lobby organization Citizens United, and has served as advisor to the Dole and Bush political campaigns.

Brown offered several illustrations of how the right's rights are often disregarded. "For example," he explained, "in Citrus College, a professor offers to give extra credit to those students who write term papers opposed to Operation Enduring Freedom, when asked if the same extra credit is available to students who favor the Operation, the professor replied that it was not."

Brown asserted that within the last year, in a couple of West Coast universities, conservative student newspapers have been pulled off, or simply denied circulation, because the views expressed in such were not shared by those in the school's administration or greater population. 

An example of such is Whittier College where copies of The Liberty Bell, a student newspaper, were taken off circulation because the paper was never approved by the university's publication committee. 

It has been ten months since, and the newspaper has still not been approved. The college claims that there are vacancies in the publication committee and it cannot meet until those vacancies are filled. Brown claims that the "free speech rights of those students at Withier were totally abridged by campus actions."

Brown also expressed that a lot of times administrators achieve censorship by "using the bureaucratic process to stifle free speech," such as was the case at Withier.

During the Clinton administration, the U.S. Education Department's Office of Civil Rights implemented campus speech codes. To receive federal funds, universities needed to follow these codes. The speech codes were intended to forbid the expression of racist, homophobic, sexist and other demeaning speech, as well as behavior or conduct that harasses.

According to Brown, the Bush administration argued that the federal civil rights regulations do not justify campus speech codes or other rules that inhibit free speech or expression.  

He quoted a letter released by the Bush administration to universities as saying, "The policies do not require, or prescribe speech conduct, or harassment codes, that impair the exercise of rights protected under the first amendment."

"Universities like speech codes" mentioned Brown; he says the overwhelming reaction from campus administrators is "this is great stuff. We like to control our student bodies and we like to make sure that what is said on campus falls under our close requirements."

Brown touched on the fact that liberals often compare Bush to Hitler. He elaborated by saying, "I think it hurts the Left ... they show their idiocy and are exposed for having really faulty logic. What Bush is doing in Iraq is nothing like what Hitler did in Germany. It trivializes what Hitler did and makes these Leftists look stupid."

There was a poster being displayed which attempted to aid in distinguishing the left from the right.  The poster simply had the word "YES" directly above a picture of Pres. Reagan and Madeline Albright, and right below was the word "NO" with a picture of Hillary Clinton and Fidel Castro.

A couple of audience members commented on the visual. One student in particular, junior Javier Ruiz, said "Why is it that Left-wingers or democrats are always being compared to Castro? Why not Roosevelt instead of Castro, as an example of the Left?"

Brown's response was, "The beauty of free speech is you can argue with them, just as you can argue in comparing Bush to Hitler, you can argue about that."

Senior Andy Diaz countered "You are making it a political issue, you said the Left said Bush is a Nazi, without addressing the fact that the right says democrats are communists ... It's a bit one sided your argument" expressed Diaz, "almost moronic."

To which Brown finalized, "Clearly, I think it's moronic to compare Bush to Hitler."

Although the forum part of the lecture took a more general political slant, Brown's main point was to emphasize that "[universities] are of the Left." 

Brown urged conservative students to stand up and take their rights back. "Free speech is the foundation for all our other freedoms," stated Brown, "and freedom of speech sometimes hurts, there is no right not to have our feelings hurt." 

In response to the lecture and the audiences' reaction, ASCU Vice President Jose Tuerve-Colon, simply stated "If you are young and you are not a liberal you have no heart, if you are old and you are a liberal you have no brain."

University Council Update 

The meeting began with the report of SGC President Nicaise Parillon. She opened with an update to the ongoing debate between the UP and BBC councils regarding uneven representation on the university-wide council and unfair distribution of funds.

Parillon said that the university-wide council met on Oct. 10 to discuss the matter and see if they could come to a compromise. BBC agreed to add one more UP representative to the council as long as decisions would be made by a 2/3 vote instead of a simple majority. This way, Parillon said, neither campus' council will be the deciding factor for resolutions made. 

Parillon announced that budgets will be further discussed among the council, but there will most likely be a cap to the amount of money funded to BBC's SGC.

The university-wide council will now consist of five representatives from UP and four from BBC. The fifth UP representative will only help to decide on budget issues because UP has a significantly higher population than does BBC, and all such decisions will require the favor of at least six council members.

Food Evaluation

The council went on to discuss a new project to evaluate the food and food services provided at BBC. The Campus Life and Student Union committees proposed to implement five separate committees for this, one of which will be a food evaluation committee consisting of hospitality management majors, particularly in the restaurant track. They will evaluate hygiene, cleanliness, and additional food practices at the campus.

Hazing at University of Michigan prompts bills to criminalize act 



A hazing of eight pledges to the Sigma Chi fraternity at the University of Michigan last month prompted Sen. Michelle McManus, R-Lake Leelanau, to introduce two bills that would criminalize hazing in Michigan.

Currently, Michigan is one of eight states that do not have an anti-hazing law.

The bills sponsored by McManus would define hazing as a crime and assess penalties of up to 20 years in prison if the hazing results in a death. The consent of the victim would not be a factor under the proposed law.

The pledges involved in the incident, which occurred from Sept.10-12, were ordered to crawl on bare hands and feet over a basement floor littered with shards of broken beer bottles. They also had to do up to 1,000 push-ups and were deprived of adequate amounts of sleep, water and food.

State Sen. Liz Brater, D-Ann Arbor, said she is cosponsoring McManus' bills and will introduce a bill of her own next week to subject fraternity chapters to up to $50,000 in civil penalties in hazing incidents.

U-M's Sigma Chi chapter, established in 1877, was expelled from campus as a result of the recent incident. The chapter had been on probation with U-M's Interfraternity Council for a March hazing incident where two pledges reported being injured.

Frail Pope beatifies Mother Teresa



ROME - Pope John Paul II declared Mother Teresa of Calcutta to be "blessed" on Oct.19.

The two-and-a-half hour ceremony and liturgy included sari-clad dancers bearing flowers and incense from India, where she devoted most of her life to nursing the sick and dying poor.

The beatification, which was marked by the unveiling of her portrait on the high frieze of St. Peter's Basilica, means that the nun may now be referred to as "Blessed Mother Teresa." Beatification is the final step before canonization, or sainthood, and it seems likely that Mother Teresa, who died in 1997, will be wearing a halo soon. 

Mother Teresa was revered in her lifetime as a "living saint." The crowd at the ceremony was estimated in excess of 300,000.

Headline: SGA strikes compromise on representation, budget debate
Author: Tuere Allwood / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Government Councils of University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus have finally come to a compromise in the ongoing debate over representation on the University Wide Council and the allocation of SGA funds.

The debate began with the proposal by UP-SGC to increase the number of UP representatives that reside on the University Wide Council to five, instead of the current four representatives from each campus, because UP houses far more students than BBC. 

This, though, is not the first time that such a debate has raged between the two councils.

"Because of the nature of the two student governments, there are going to be some problems every year. We are two groups with representative power sharing the same money," said UP-SGC President Clayton Solomon.

The University Wide Council is responsible for coordinating "the activities of the SGCs and to represent the interests of all FIU students on matters of university-wide, county, state, and federal concern," as the latest draft of SGA's constitution reads.With the changes of the recent compromise, SGA will include be comprised of a University Wide Budget Committee, in addition to its existing University Wide Council. 

This new budget committee will consist of the current members of the University Wide Council, plus one additional UP representative. This committee will be responsible for drafting the annual SGA budget, and all decicions of the committee will require a 2/3 vote.

The compromise of the two councils also includes a cap on the amount of money allocated to BBC out of SGA's budget. 

BBC may not receive more than a multiple of 2.25 of the percentage of the collective expenses generated by the combination of BBC and any campuses, particularly the Broward/Pines Center, for which BBC is responsible. Still, BBC, while satisfied with the extra representation of UP, does not express very much excitement about the budget limits.

"We are part of the university. Even though we are a smaller campus, it doesn't mean we don't operate efficiently. Sometimes, we will need more money than we generate in order to improve our campus. I think it would be great if every campus could be like University Park. But there is no harm in allowing other students to benefit from a smaller campus," said BBC-SGC President Nicaise Parillon. 

UP representatives say they are just happy the debate is over and the two councils could work together.

"I'm exhausted. But I'm glad that we were able to have a healthy negotiation of policy," Solomon said. "For the council to be able to sit and compromise, without making rash decisions or taking everything personal, makes me feel excited and accomplished."

According to Solomon and Parillon, there is always a problem, especially when it comes to budget, between the two councils. UP-SGC believed that BBC was getting too much money than what it generated, but this was always something that BBC-SGC fought, said Parillon.

"They're going to have to accept us as their child, and not treat us as a step child," Parillon said.

Still, both campuses say they are proud of the fact that they were able to unify and find a common ground.

"I think we've come a long way from where we started, when nobody was willing to move. It speaks volumes of our ability to work together as a council," said UP Speaker of the House Collette Papa.

Although some minor changes still need to be made as regards the budget of the two councils, according to Solomon, the major issues are out of the way, and the kinks will be worked out later.

"This is healthy. Life is about compromise. Both Student Government councils learned a lot from this experience," Solomon said.

Right now, the councils are just anxious to get back to other issues affecting the university.

"I am always willing to work with the other campus. I respect Clayton for doing what he did and I hope that he can respect my wishes as well. I'm just happy it is pretty much over so I can get to working on things that have more of an impact on my constituents in the time that I am president," Parillon said.

As to whether or not the compromise will work, both councils say that only time will tell.

Many students who had a chance to compare meal plans and buffet deals at University Park with the food choices at the Biscayne Bay Campus, have come to the conclusion that options as well as prices are better in the south. Some think that prices at BBC have actually increased in Fall 2003. 

Aramark, the company that manages food services for FIU, operates on two campuses that are very different in size, number of students, and available facilities. That is the core of the issue, which many students do not consider.

"I've heard that food is cheaper at UP," said freshman Tavery Calvert. "They even have an  all-you-can-eat restaurant, and here you have to pay separately for everything, which makes it more expensive."

Senior Don Kumm complained that the minimum breakfast price in the BBC food court has nearly doubled for him since his $2.29 two-eggs, hash browns, biscuit and coffee special disappeared from the menu. 

But Aramark, which buys, prepares and serves the food, in addition to composing menus, hiring employees and running franchises like Subway or Pollo Tropical, looks at the issue through an economic perspective. 

"You can't compare apples to oranges," said Pepe Garcia, the director of Food Service at UP. "Our meal plans this semester are supported by 660 students - a guaranteed income. That is totally different from the retail type of operation."

At BBC, students pay for each item individually, as opposed to the buffet - style option available at the UP cafeteria.

UP, with more than 27,000 students, nearly 1,900 of whom live on-campus, is a much bigger market compared to the modest BBC, where about 7,800 students have been taking classes this semester, and only 277 live on campus. Paul Sparks, the director of Food Service at BBC, estimates that there are no more than 1,000 daily food-related transactions here, excluding Fridays and weekends. 

With a much smaller number of students, uncertain number of sales, and limited space, the old-fashioned cashier registers are the only feasible option for BBC. 

"We have to maintain the economics of the business to keep things open," Sparks said.

The BBC Café Features counter, for example, serves daily entrée specials that cost about $4 on average (add a dollar to make it a combo with a large soft drink). 

UP, by contrast, has Fresh Food Company cafeteria located in the Graham Center, where all-you-can-eat (and drink) feast purchased through The Flex 19, one of the popular meal plans, costs $3.59 on average. Without a meal plan, however, the door price rises to $5.30 for breakfast and $6.37 during the rest of the day. 

"It is still a good deal," said junior Rick Sanchez. "When you look at the number of choices, it is definitely worth it."

UP offers a variety of plans ranging from The Block of 50 Meals priced at $288.35 to The Unlimited Plan students can purchase for $1,690.03 per semester.

Although these plans are not an option at BBC, students there still have a chance to save a little money through the Declining Balance Plan, available at both campuses. With this plan, the ID card is used as a debit card; for example, if a student puts in $300, he or she receives extra $15 from Aramark, as a form of incentive. 

Although it offers a five to 10 percent discount at the cash register, Sparks' office at BBC has processed only 31 requests so far this semester. Again, the number is higher at UP, where about 250 students participate, according to Ximena Cordero, the marketing manager of Dining Services.  

Another reason prices might appear different on the two campuses is the differing franchise outlets.

 For example, BBC sells Starbucks coffee, and University Park has an additional option, Java City. The latter, with $1.15 for a 12 oz. cup of house coffee, is slightly cheaper. Students at the BBC Starbucks pay $1.40. Still, the coffee at BBC costs about 20 cents less than the same size cup sold in an off-campus Starbucks. 

When it comes to identical products, however, both campuses have to maintain the same prices. According to Felecia Townsend, the associate director of Business Services, who oversees the Aramark operations at FIU, there is not a single food item at BBC that sells at a higher retail price than the exact same item at UP. 

Moreover, "If there is any change in price at UP, there has to be a corresponding change at BBC, and vice versa," Townsend said. 

And that doesn't usually happen until the Food Service employees do a survey of prices in retail locations, like Subway or Starbucks shops in the area near campus. 

"Then we look at our prices, and try to keep them at or below the off-campus prices," Townsend said. 

The retail prices of food have not changed much in this school year. Some items sold at BBC, like fruit and fresh baked Otis Spunkmeyer cookies, have increased by a few pennies. Pizza Hut went up more significantly in the fall - from $2.98 for a cheese pizza in the last school year, to $3.39 (which matches the price change at UP.) There are also items, including a few Subway sandwiches, which have gone down by 20 cents on average. 

For now, BBC Food Service must work within the means of the available facility. There are, however, plans for expansion. 

"We should see a new food court at the rear of the Wolfe University Center in about two years," said Nicholas DiCiacco, the executive director of Business and Finance. 

Construction for the new cafeteria is scheduled to begin in March. The new facility will accommodate more modern services with a fresher appearance. It will still be a retail location. 

The more immediate changes for the food court include the addition of kosher foods to the menu, scheduled to launch within the next few weeks at both locations. At BBC,  the kosher food will be kept frozen and available upon request at the Café Features counter. It will have to be prepared individually in a microwave oven. 

"There will be a campus-wide e-mail stating what is available and the prices," Sparks said. "We'll have three to four different menu options which will be listed on the menu board."

At UP kosher food will be sold in the convenience store at UP Towers and/or at Gracie's Grill in the Graham Center, according to Cordero. The Dining Services office is still deciding.

Subway, the most popular lunch choice at BBC, will be moved to the former grill area. 

According to Sparks, the grill was cancelled this semester to increase efficiency. All grill items, except for the two that didn't sell well, were moved over to the Café Features counter. 

Besides, the wall at the grill outlet was too high, making it impossible to see the food being prepared, which is the main appeal of a grill stand. The grill employee was also transferred to the Café Features area, to speed up the service during busy hours. 

After the Subway moves in December, that area will accommodate Pan Geos, another variety outlet, featuring salads, sandwiches, and wraps, with lots of vegetarian  choices. 

"The idea is to give a little more variety up there, keeping the popular Subway, but getting it away from the door," DiCiacco said. 

 Students at BBC are welcome to offer their comments. Sparks and his team have been trying to get student input through the meetings of the Food Committee, which invites members of the faculty, staff, and the Student Government Association to evaluate a certain area of the food court each month. 

"I'd like to see the students come in and let us know what they like and what they don't like," Sparks said. "Students, faculty and staff are our customers, and we want to do the best for our customers, just like any other retail locations would like to."

Subheadline: "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre": Good ol' gory horror flick
Author: Krystal Alvarez/ Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Everything's bigger in Texas, including the number of homicidal maniacs with a twisted love for chainsaws.  

The 2003 remake of the 1974 cult classic (by the same name) "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" opened in theatres Oct. 17. 

The movie that threatened the hitchhiking community was remade into a modern blockbuster horror flick full of blood-splattering death scenes and some of the most insane characters ever seen since on the big screen.  

The movie is based on real events that occurred in the summer of 1974 as police found 33 dead bodies in an isolated slaughterhouse in Travis County, Texas. 

The killer, who fashioned a grotesque mask, became known as the legendary "Leatherface."  

The horrific events that took place that summer are told through the perspective of the only known survivor of the five young adults who happened to encounter the demented madman. 

Starring Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel and Eric Balfour, the movie starts with them driving through Texas so they can go to a Lynard Skynard concert. 

After finding a distraught hitchhiker, the movie takes its expected twist into the realm of horror.

The movie is told documentary style and the cinematography resembles the style of cinema seen in the '70s. 

The movie manages to capture the creepy moviemaking style that earlier horror films had, and current horror films lack and are in dire need of. 

With every terrible noise of the chainsaw, the crowd immersed themselves in the character's shrieking pleas. 

Leatherface's enduring hunt for his prey was relentless but not ridiculous. He did not walk slowly towards the running victims and managed to catch up, he didn't magically recover from a stab or appear of what seems like thin air. Leatherface, as bizarre as it sounds, was a really convincing character. Sure, a very frightening character, but a believable villain none-the-less. The other characters are zany and hard to swallow, but that's the magic of scary movies - they don't have to make sense, they just have to entertain and horrify. This weird version of Southern hospitality touches a nerve in every moviegoer and is surely a chilling treat that will make you think twice before every driving through rural America. 

The movie was a step forward in horror flicks. It is a remake and the original gripping film, deserves its props, but this modern rendition holds its own. Lacking movie cliches and copying that beautiful horror style that brings a tear to any horror fans' eye, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is definitely a must-see. You'll never look at the hardware section at Home Depot again without thinking of mutilated bodies and disgusting masks made of human flesh. I guarantee it!

Headline: Q And Not U: Too intense for boring crowd at I/O
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
At the scheduled start of show time, 8 p.m. on Oct. 14, the I/O lounge in Downtown Miami was pretty much dead, besides myself and a few friends. Slowly, as the local opener Septembre took the stage, a crowd began to develop. 

However, even after the second and third openers, I could not believe the disappointing turnout for the Q And Not U show, which I had been looking forward to for several months. The indie group was making their way through Florida as part of an extensive tour, joined by fellow D.C. bands, French Toast and Black Eyes. After all, it was a Tuesday night, but I imagined that the entire Miami scene would have packed in for this show. I never realized our scene was so underage. 

I'm beginning to wonder if this is a national problem; Q and Not U drummer John Davis commented on several show stops in other cities being a little crowd-dry. All I can say is that you guys have missed one hell of a tour.

After a bit of a slow start from September, French Toast took the stage. Consisting of only two members, their colorful blend of steady-paced rock and electronic drum-machine beats brightened up the venue. 

Although I found the urge to dance irresistible, the crowd seemed a little bored but overall, they were a nice prelude to the insanely interesting Black Eyes. 

Consisting of unconventional instrumentation like dual drummers and a saxophone player, this spastic experimental rock group pierced through the silence with explosively poetic music. It hurt to listen to these guys, not because they were bad, but because it was just so loud. 

Driving beats from two drum seats complimented the bouncing bass rhythms and worked well with the purposely off-key guitar/sax combo. Although they may not be as accessible as Q And Not U, Black Eyes were an excellent addition to the show. Yet again though, I found the audience slightly uninterested and a little confused. At this point I was beginning to feel a little embarrassed.

After Black Eyes' shocking bit, the rest of the audience who had spent the last hour or so hiding out in another room finally decided to come watch the show. 

Q And Not U politely introduced themselves then proceeded to rock and amaze the audience. Finally, some signs of life from the dormant crowd! Singing, dancing and clapping to the beat ensued. 

Q And Not U dished out a fair and varied set, starting mostly with songs from their last LP, Different Damage, finishing up with a round of songs from everybody's favorite, No Kill No Beep Beep and mixing in their two new, seemingly political, singles "X-Polynation" and "Book of Flags."

What a way to awaken a half-sleeping group of people. Their pulsing rhythms and melodies can only match the band's driving beats. It's addictive and dance-inducing music one just can't get enough of - especially after three encores.

 Comparable to only a handful of other bands like Fugazi and Les Savy Fav, Q And Not U have broken through several creative barriers, creating music that's just as fun to listen to in your stereo as it is to hear live. 

I could not have asked for a better evening of music. Some may be quick to think that the music these D.C. artists create isn't the easiest thing to swallow, but I disagree. 

All you need is a little imagination and you'll find yourself strangely hooked. I am quite surprised there wasn't an even larger turnout. Next time Q And Not U come into town, be sure not to miss them.

Headline: No more 'Monkey' business: Band shrugs off its colorful past
Author: Chuck Myers / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
A new album.

A major tour with a rock legend.

And an "Odditorium."

Idle time hardly seems to be a problem for The Dandy Warhols.

Once noted for its rambunctious, sometimes racy stage behavior, the power pop quartet of singer/guitarist Courtney Taylor, guitarist Peter Holmstrom (also known as Peter Loew, after he adopted the maiden last name of his wife), keyboardist Zia McCabe and drummer Brent DeBoer now draws attention with its richly layered sound.

On the heels of its widely praised 2000 album Thirteen Tales From Urban Bohemia, the band's latest release, Welcome to the Monkey House (Capitol), may elevate The Dandy Warhols to a greater commercial plane.

Welcome to the Monkey House marks the fourth album by the Portland, Ore.-based band. The album exhibits sonic continuity with a smooth mix of aggressive and sensual numbers. 

Although content with the result, the band feels that Thirteen Tales was actually more musically diverse.

"I think that the Monkey House is actually more of similar sounding record," says Holmstrom. "And it's just production value. Whereas on Thirteen Tales, I though we did cover a broader spectrum. But it's just in style. But, then again, both records fit together really well."

To help build the lush sound on Monkey House, the band brought in Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran to assist with producing. 

While Rhodes added some distinctive touches, Holmstrom notes that his actual contributions to the album were very focused, particularly on the ethereal "Insincere."

"That's one of the two songs that Nick wrote and really, like, actually earned producer credit for," says Holmstrom. 

"It's kind of a title, and sort of a weird one. Because we'd been working on the record for about a year before he got involved. And the record pretty much sounded then the way it sounds now, except for `Insincere' and `Over It.' ... The other ones (songs), he just sort of put the frosting on top."

Formed in 1992, The Dandy Warhols gained notoriety early on for its antics onstage, which reportedly included Taylor appearing in the nude during live performances. 

Today, the group prefers to focus on long concert sets rather than risque visual surprises. 

The band generally shrugs off its colorful past, and thinks its live show reputation has been overblown.

"It's totally hyped up from the press," explains Holmstrom. 

"It's not something that ever happened all that often. It probably hasn't happened for five years, you know, but it still keeps coming up. It's gotten better on the last two albums. It really has. We sort of realized that all you had to do is put out a third record, and people took you a little more seriously."

Following in the footsteps of its namesake, artist Andy Warhol, the band is developing a Portland version of Warhol's once famous New York artistic hub, "The Factory." 

The goal of the group's "Odditorium" is to provide a creative haven where artists can work on projects.

"The building is going to be sort of our version of 'The Factory,'" says Holmstrom. 

"It's not a studio yet. But it will be. ... We shot our video there. And we've done photo shoots. There's a kitchen and a lounge. And we run our Web site out of there. And if we get everything we want, we'll be able to take in bands, bring them in and do their records, shoot their videos and everything."

With a North American early fall tour already in the bag, The Dandy Warhols have headed to Europe for a tour with David Bowie. 

Although the band would prefer to tour on its own, it couldn't turn down the opportunity to travel with Bowie, especially after the rock icon personally asked the group to be his opening act.

"It is full steam ahead," says Holmstrom. 

"The Bowie dates don't pay as well as dates on our own do. But the exposure is so great that the payoff is there. ... You know, out of all the bands he could have picked, yeah, obviously we feel honored."

Headline: "Chainsaw Massacre" evokes classic scares
Author: Robert Gramatges / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I got the piss scared out of me on Friday night. Culprit: "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." First and foremost, let me just state I am a tough cookie when it comes to being frightened. This movie, however, squashed my courage like a fragile little mosquito. 

Interestingly, I was not only frightened. The movie provoked my mind with some insightful thought on the way home (which is a feat for a Friday night). 

My first reflection, in the horror movie fashion, was on the stupid choices the characters of the movie made. 

I don't want to get into much detail about the dumb things these young'ins did (as to not spoil the movie), but I will say this: When a deformed fat man (who is surprisingly light on his feet) is chasing you with a chainsaw, just haul butt. 

This is not the time to create any cockamamie schemes or have a sudden attack of conscience. I just love how the most unscrupulous, pot-smoking, gun-slinging character always seems to grow a moral conscience in the end. This is the time they need to be cutthroat to save themselves! Instead, what do they do? Try and save the world. Give me a break. That is not real life. Scumbags will be scumbags until the bitter end.

All stupidity aside, "Massacre" took me by surprise with the grasp it had on my attention. This is one of those movies that extracts you from your life for two hours. 

This true blue edge-of- your-seat thriller just sucked me in. I found myself curled in an upright fetal position with my face looking like I just saw a puppy mangled. 

And as if that weren't enough, my emotions during the film somehow compelled me to scream out advice to the characters I was so involved with at the time. 

I found this most hilarious because I hate people who chatter during movies. I was not only chattering, I was raising my voice when the individuals in the film wouldn't heed my advice. I felt like Brenda from "Scary Movie." And as funny as she is, the comparison isn't the keenest. 

All comparisons aside, I was truly petrified after I left the theater. Something about Leatherface just turns me into a little ball of fear. 

I drove home a little on edge that night. Ah, who am I kidding? I was very on edge because I thought I was going to be bludgeoned by everyone I saw. I saw Leatherface in everything. I had not been that scared since I saw "Child's Play" as a kid. 

I realized that the fear of being cut to pieces could bring out two very different perspectives in a person. It can give you an urge to do the nasty and live it up with a carpe diem attitude. 

In me, it brought out the other prespective. I made sure I was an angel that night so that when Leatherface came to claim me I would die a good person. It was at that point that the last minute redemption of the scumbag made a bit more sense.

Headline: "Dream, Dare, Do" exhibit celebrates road trips
Author: Jennifer Sittig / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Adventurous and determined, Cesar Becerra and Maud Dillingham have accomplished their dreams.

"Our trip and collections are a living time capsule for 1999," said Becerra, or Mr. Miami as some have termed him because of his love of Miami and its history. 

Becerra and Dillingham have a love for history and the human experience.  In 1999, with the support of SGA and companies in the South Florida area, they geared up to take a year-long road trip across all 50 states in a 1979 Chevy Malibu Classic that had the American Flag painted on it.  

"[The plan] was multifaceted, it was our way of celebrating the millennium," Becerra said.

Preceding their road trip and after having gotten married, Dillingham gave Becerra an ultimatum: "Look if we get married, you have to promise that we get the heck out of here every now and then."  

According to Becerra, Dillingham dreams up their adventures and he makes them into larger projects.

"The flag-car" traveled some 41,000 miles and never broke down.  It helped the couple collect 6,000 photos, 150 hours of footage and lots of trinkets, produce a weekly, full color newsletter, do a weekly radio show and appear on the Travel Channel.  They met with local, state and government officials. Throughout their journey across America, they camped, stayed in hotels, with family and friends and with host families through Servas.

Says Becerra, "We were able to stay with real American families and see their dreams."

In Texas during the then Governor George Bush's term, they captured teachers picketing against vouchers.

According to Becerra, they were a sponge when it came to political issues for documentation purposes, "The collection represents the last age of innocence in America and the millennium bug that turned out to not be so big.  It was a special time, when America was riding high, prior to the events of 9/11." 

The tour allowed them to dispel fallacies about people and places. "State to state, the fallacies were always wrong," Cesar said.  

"Prior to the trip, I was worried about our safety," said Dillingham.  "I was impressed with how friendly and open all Americans are."

The couple stays in contact with many of the friends and acquaintances they made during their journeys.

At the end of the tour, Dillingham's father passed away and Becerra was diagnosed with diabetes, which is illustrated in the "Road to Recovery" part of the exhibition at the University Park campus.

"Life looked dark.  We both fell into a deep depression.  Negative thoughts went through our heads, but Maud insisted that we get back on the horse, which was "Peak for Progress," said Becerra, "The hike was a rebuilding process and healed us through the funk."

"Peak for Progress" was an Appalachian Trail Hike for Diabetes that Becerra and Dillingham walked as a fundraiser, it took them from Maine to Georgia in 2001 - 2002. Alaska, Mount Washington in New Hampshire and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota were some of their most memorable and recommended places to visit.  

The car is no longer their preferred way to travel despite their road warrior adventures; they both have "divorced our cars," jokes Becerra. "We realized after the "Peak for Progress" fundraiser that going slow, you see things clearer and it represents growth and our ability to move on."

Now, Becerra and Dillingham are in California working on exhibits and documentaries for both trips.  The exhibits at FIU have been on tour prior to their arrival and will continue touring the country after Dec. 1, 2003. 

We have no concrete future plans.  We are harvesting the materials from our past adventures," Dillingham said.

Because of the amount of material collected, FIU's history department is offering five independent study courses in the spring semester. 

Brian Peterson, associate professor of history, and Becerra will interview candidates for the five distinct areas of study related to the exhibit. For more information about the independent study course offered in the spring, contact the history department.

"It is a unique way for anybody interested in travel and history to use everyday items, photos and tchotchkys to understand and report about who we are as a people," states the course flyer.

Students in the independent study course will work with the bigger collection that exists behind the scenes in the Special Collections office of the library.

"We hope people are able to look at the collections and use them as educational tools," said Becerra.  "It will also be interesting what the collections say about us."

"Dream, Dare, Do @ FIU" features materials from both "Motoring into the Millennium," which can be seen at the Green Library at UP, and "Peak for Progress," which can be viewed at the library at Biscayne Bay campus.

[The exhibits] will be very enlightening, with a strong push of inspiration that dreams begin at FIU," Becerra said.

Subheadline: All Got Our Runnins: Whets appetite, but ultimately disappoints
Author: Megan Kelley / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Mike Skinner (the Streets) earned his place in the British garage/2-step scene with his debut release of Original Pirate Material, an album that reached the number two spot on the Billboard Top Electronic Album chart. 

Although the follow-up to this album is not scheduled for release until early 2004, the Streets has allowed us to whet our appetite with an internet exclusive EP, All Got Our Runnins.

All Got Our Runnins will be available for download from online music retailers such as Emusic.com.  

It will not be released in stores.

Skinner's witty social commentary is not lacking in this EP, which is a set of previously unreleased tracks and remixes (some featuring artists such as Ashley Beedle, High Contrast and Roll Deep with Dizzie Rascal). 

The EP, however, somehow leaves something to be desired. It is, bluntly put, uninspiring. 

Don't get me wrong, the whole album is not a total mess. 

The opening songs (an instrumental version of  "Streets Score," "Give Me Back My Lighter," and "All Got Our Runnins") are an impressive combination of creative, attention-catching lyrics and dance-influenced beats. 

The rest of the recording, unfortunately, is unoriginal and slightly repetitive, an effect the remix has a tendency to generate.

But this EP, of course, does not fail give the Streets' fans a reason to dance. 

The four middle tracks are all about the proverbial "shaking" of "what your mama gave you." By the seventh cut ("It's Come To This" featuring High Contrast), there is no doubt that the Streets' audience will be shaking "their stuff" all over the place. 

Although this release was not the most monumental, I will say this: It is not yet time to lose faith in our Birmingham-born garage hip-hop artist. 

Nominated by the Chemical Brothers for MTV2's Shortlist Music Prize, Skinner is up for recognition of Original Pirate Material. 

The award ceremony will air Oct. 24 on MTV2 at 8 p.m. 

The Streets also performed live for the Shortlist concert on Oct. 5 with his seven-piece band.

Latin rock is taking over Miami. If you don't know what I mean, it seems like you missed the Latin explosion here at the  Biscayne Bay Campus.  The Latin Fusion Concert was held in the ballroom on Friday Oct. 17 and was organized by the assistant director of Campus Life, Rafael Zapata, and sponsored by MTV Español, 94.9 Zeta En Fuego, Boom, Fabrika Latin Alternative, Pure Rock and Trasnocho.com.  

"This is the first year we're doing this type of concert, it came as a request from the students, then we had to look at what artists we could bring with the budget that we had," said Zapata. There were about 45 different bands that were interested in playing Friday night, but SPC was limited on who they could bring in. 

Outside the ballroom, they had a table with promotional singles, from people such as Juanes, David Bisbal, Luis Fonsi and many more, all free and available to whoever came. The bands that were selected to perform were: Volumen Cero, Locos Por Juana, Calle Silvestre, Soniko, 5am, Pepe Alva, Jorge Correa 'Tereso', Jorge Moreno and Didier.  The concert got off to a slow start, and the performances had to be delayed, but when they started it really began to rock.  

The opening act was former Menudo singer Didier, which has now singed on as a soloist and has a new single coming out called 'Dime Tu'.  The band had great sounds and great lyrics.  People started showing up around 10:30 p.m. or so, and there were people of almost all ages and all ethnicities.  This concert became a cultural bash. Some FIU students made the trip from Kendall just to see the performances. 

"I think it's great, I think that events like this really help Spanish rock go further in Miami, I think it's very underrated, but Latin rock is finally getting the recognition it deserves here in the U.S," said Randolf Hattick, a junior from UP.  

As the night continued, we were dazzled by the band 5am and their vocalist Lenny Pena, whom I was able to speak to backstage. He explained what has inspired him and the band,  "One inspiration for us has been the Beatles, definitely Led Zepplin and personally for myself, ballad singers from the '80s and Spanish artists like Jose Jose inspired me a lot and the band," said Pena.  

Most of the bands there were just aspiring artists trying to get known and signed for a record deal.  I met with Omar Alfano, producer and composer, and found out a few things that aspiring artists should know about the business and how to make it, "The most important advice I can give them is to have some sort of direction and goal of what they want to achieve, people have always thought that you must have faith. You're not supposed to have faith, you're supposed to have a goal, because you can have faith that you're going to make it, but if you don't have an ear for music, no one will give you a record deal," Alfano also says that the most difficult hurdle is getting signed up with a record company.  

Pepe Alva was one of the last performances, and when he got on stage with his band, everybody moved closer and started jamming to the beat, he has a Peruvian Indian mix to his Latin rock music which gives it a little kick and gets the people dancing to the lyrics and sounds. 

 Along with Locos Por Juana and Soniko, Pepe Alva was one of the singers that got the concert moving and most people feeling the show was worthwhile.  

Calle Silvestre drummer Maria Isabel said that with all the applauses here tonight, everything they left behind and sacrificed was worth it in the end.  All the bands were incredible and they all had such soul and dedication put into their music, you can only wish for them to make it big.

For all those who are trying to make it in the music industry,  94.9 Zeta announced the start of En Fuego, which is part of the growing Latin rock in Miami, and gives bands and soloists an opportunity to show off there talents in a friendly competition and to get known.  

These contests take place Sunday nights at Quench in Coconut Grove.  For all those who were at the concert Friday night, Soniko is in the second competition on Nov. 2. The winner gets to perform live at the Lo McXimo de la Música concert being held at the James L. Knight Center Nov. 15. 

En Fuego is also part of Sunday night Latin rock on 94.9 Zeta. Between the hours of 7 p.m. until 11 p.m., Zeta plays Latin rock featuring such artists as: Pepe Alva, Amargo, A.N.I.M.A.L, Ricardo Arjona, Aterciopelados and Volumen Cero.

Headline: Women's soccer breaks scoreless streak, earns two draws
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Oct. 14- FIU 1, Bucknell 1

After going almost a month without scoring a single goal, the Lady Panthers finally put the ball in the net to end a four-game scoreless streak, which dated back to Sept. 21 against UCF. 

FIU's lone goal helped break a season-high six-game losing streak, as the Golden Panthers tied Bucknell 1-1 at University Park on Oct. 14.

Bucknell's Shannon Curd attempted the team's ninth shot of the first half and placed the ball past FIU goalkeeper Juliana Gomez to put the Bison in front 1-0 in the 36th minute. 

But the Golden Panthers responded quickly, when Tamara Kochen found teammate Melanie Delehany, who was able to strike the ball past Bucknell goalkeeper Katie Dry for the equalizer in the 44th minute, knotting the game at one apiece.

After the 90 minute regulation time expired, FIU was denied the chance to earn its first victory since Sept. 14 against Charleston Southern because overtime was cancelled due to prearranged travel plans by Bucknell.

The Golden Panthers were outshot 16-6 in the contest and Bucknell held a 6-1 corner kick advantage, but Gomez played outstanding in the net, tallying 7 saves in the match for FIU. 

"Juliana played great for us. She made save after save and kept us alive in this game," senior Carmen Lopez said. "But it would have been nice to try to get a win in overtime," she added.

The draw improved FIU's record to 1-10-1 on the season. Buckell is now 7-3-2.

Oct. 17- FIU 2, South Florida 2

The Lady Panthers waited until the very end of the game to get going, but were able to score two late goals to rally from a two-goal deficit to tie the Bulls 2-2 in Jacksonville on Oct. 17. 

The game was scoreless at halftime, but South Florida's Jenny Muvihill converted headers off corner kicks in the 63rd and 65th minutes to give the Bulls a commanding 2-0 lead against an FIU offense that had only scored two goals or more in a game once this season. But the FIU offense found its groove, exploding for two quick goals in the game's final 12 minutes to tie the game.

Charissa Gingerich converted a loose ball lingering in the Bulls' penalty box into a goal in the 79th minute to cut the deficit to one.

With less than five minutes left in regulation, Kristy Caunter and Annelie Lindborg assisted on an Elizabeth Durozel goal, who tied the game at two after some fancy footwork. Durozel was fed the ball and ended up in a one-on-one situation with USF goalkeeper Breck Bankester, who was unable to stop Durozel's shot.

"We came out very hard and set the tone, but we got behind 2-0. But we were able to come back from behind which was great because we haven't been able to do it all season," said Lopez.

Despite being outshot 25-11, Juliana Gomez (11 saves) and the Golden Panthers were able to hang on to the tie. FIU (1-10-2) will next plays at UALR on Oct. 24.

Headline: Boswell leads 10th ranked men's soccer to clutch win
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
"Bobby is the man."

Those were the exact words out of senior Johnny Pulido's mouth after FIU extended its unbeaten streak to seven games with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over the South Florida Bulls in Tampa on Oct. 18.

Pulido was referring to teammate Bobby Boswell, who with two minutes left in regulation, broke a scoreless tie with a huge goal in front of his hometown.

Boswell, a Tampa native, broke free in the top of the box in the 88th minute and slipped the ball past USF goalkeeper Dane Brenner for the 1-0 lead in front of the Bulls' largest home crowd of the year (1,023).

"I received a nice cross and one of the defenders deflected the ball right to me and I just shot it and it went past the keeper," Boswell said. "But it was really cool to score the game winning goal in front of my friends and family."

The defensive battle between both teams almost led to disaster for FIU (8-2-2) in the 14th minute when junior Allen Handy tried to clear the ball, but accidentally directed it toward his own goal. However, senior goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg was able to make a diving save on the play to keep the game scoreless.

USF (4-6-2) also barely avoided trouble five minutes later when Brenner raced from the goal to charge oncoming FIU forward Carron Williams, who was loose on a breakaway. Brenner was able to kick the ball off of Williams, but the ball then ricocheted toward the goal. Luckily for the Bulls, defender Kareem Smith got back in time and prevented the ball from crossing the goal line. 

"We created so many chances, but couldn't convert," said Pulido. "But in the end, Bobby stepped up for us and got the goal."

Both teams played outstanding defense most of the game, with FIU outshooting the Bulls 14-7 and winning the corner kick battle, 5-2.

Rosenberg, who was also named the Atlantic Soccer Conference Player of the Week for the second time last week, finished the game with four saves, recording his second shutout of the season for the surging Golden Panthers.

The last time the team lost a game was Sept. 13 at No. 4 St. Louis, and has since climbed to as high as 10th in the national polls.

This week, the Golden Panthers will hit the road to take on conference opponent Adelphi on Oct. 24, followed by another road game against non-conference foe St. John's on Oct. 25.

Headline: Swimming/ diving team makes waves in first meet
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU took a dive for the first time ever, defeating in-state rival Florida A&M, but falling short to FSU in Tallahassee, Fla. on Oct. 18. 

The Golden Panthers (1-1) wiped out the Rattlers, 140-56, but fell to the host Seminoles 140-77. 

Sophomore diver Megan Balkenbush was the only FIU diver in action, but she made an immediate impact at the event. Balkenbush secured a spot in the NCAA Zone B Diving Meet, scoring 276.55 points in the 1-meter division, good for fifth place.

Balkenbush also won the three-meter competition with a score of 263.20 points. She is now eligible to compete in the one-meter, three-meter and platform events at the Zone B Meet.

FIU owned the 500 freestyle and 200 backstroke events. In the 500-meter freestyle, Sarah Perfetti, Jennifer Kornfeld and Christine Skjong-Nilson finished 1-2-3 respectively to lead the Panthers. Kate van Houten (5:15.37), Viktoria Molnar (5:16.73) and Brittany Tribus (5:36.74) also finished 1-2-3 in the 200-meter backstroke for FIU.

Head coach Noemi Zaharia was extremely proud of her team's success in their first meet.

Said Zaharia: "All of the girls were able to step up to the challenge of it being the first meet of the season without any sense of intimidation."

In addition to the success in the 500 freestyle and 200 backstroke, FIU also had success in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events. Carly Crandall led FIU with a third-place finish in 50-meter, finishing with a time of 25.53. She also finished fourth in the 100-meter with a time of 55.67. 

Molnar finished third in the 100-meter (54.17) and fourth in the 200-meter (1:56.26).

The Golden Panthers look to gain more experience in their second meet at the Sun Belt Conference Invitational on Oct. 24 at New Mexico State University.

Headline: Commentary: FIU football will win at its own pace
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
At this particular moment, it is unfair to catapult FIU into the University of Miami's shadow as many FIU fans have done. Matter-of-factly, many FIU students felt the Golden Panthers would turn into wind-blowing menaces, much like their cross-town counterparts, at an unrealistic, unreasonably foolish pace.

If FIU's student body had its way, the nation's top recruits would be exiting on the Turnpike and eighth street rather than driving down to U.S. 1 into Coral Gables.

But before you send the Sears national championship trophy - please send the NCAA and its governing body to investigate how the Golden Panthers became so good, so fast.

But the chances of FIU surfacing at the top of the BCS polls are simply not possible.

Truth be told, a lot of the time, winning is accompanied by police sirens as was the case for UM in the '80's or "Free Shoes University" (FSU) in the '90's. Yes, winning can be achieved without basking in scandal or while fighting off those pesky NCAA guys, but building clean success takes time. By no means am I saying that schools have to cheat in order to win, but lets look at some examples of such instances in which programs just happened, by mere coincidence, to win rather quickly.

First, while we are talking about UM, why not mention Warren Sapp's concealed positive drug test? The all-pro defensive tackle's failed results were swept under the proverbial rug by then coach Dennis Erickson. Or what about rap star and 2 Live Crew member Luther Campbell's hobby of writing checks for the star players of UM's 80's dynasty?

On to Tallahassee, where Deion Sanders played in a bowl game his senior year despite passing one class or even taking one final exam. 

While I think about it, even the choking Gators were enveloped in scandal in the '80's.

And if you are thinking this is just a Florida thing, you are dead  wrong because Colorado's Kordell Stewart-led national championship team came out of nowhere to find themselves in a full-blown investigation right after winning it all.

Most recently, Ohio State came under scrutiny for whatever Maurice Clarett felt like doing each day when he woke on that particular morning. Simply put: soft teams do not win national championships. Just ask Texas Longhorns' coach Mack Brown. 

Unfortunately, you need that rough-around-the-edges-type-of-recruit to take you to the mountain top. And coaches all across America must cringe and just hope that they are kept in check once they arrive on campus, led by their system - the one that works and turns all those teenagers into model citizens. 

But the list of scandals goes on and on...and on.

So thinking that FIU would come into Division 1-AA play last season and compete for a national championship, playoff berth or mere winning record means that you and your room temperature intelligence quotient should put this column down immediately.

Thank you. For those of you still here, FIU has more than enough time to live up to the hype that brought football to this up- and-coming university. 

Along with the big budget and limelight nature of football comes unrealistic, elephantine expectations at times.

This is why people stopped attending games last season, and now that the team is 0-7, the same thing is re-occurring this season.

Why the expectations to win, win big, win Miami-big in only the second year this university has had a football team? 

Consider this: UM began playing football in 1926 when they fielded a freshman-only team and went 8-0. 

Scratch that exhibition season. Their first "real" season came the following year, 1927. Led by head coach Howard Buck, the 'Canes went 3-6-1 in their inaugural campaign. Their loses equaled FIU's total from a year ago, but their victories fell two short. 

UM started something new in South Florida, which now has four professional and three Division I college programs. They were the first team to play anything that mattered down here. There were no Dolphins except for those in the ocean.

Not only did they have a losing record their first season - and didn't notch their first winning season until '29 (3-2) - but they played schools that no longer field football teams. They played the likes of Rollins, Piedmont, Spring Hill, Stetson and Millsaps. Millsaps?

 They even played the University of Havana, in Cuba, with their freshman team - twice. Last I checked Cubans do not swing lumber at oblong-shaped balls made of pigskin. What were they thinking over there...not in Cuba, but at UM?

By the way, UM's record in its first five seasons: 17-24-3. Nothing near what it is nowadays. FIU's record thus far: 5-13. Very comparable, and not that far from UM once you take everything into consideration.

Anyone know how long it took UM to win its first national title?

56 years. So why is everyone panicking? You thought it would be great to have football because it would be like Miami, well there you go. There is still a chance that one day, it will be.

Heck, we could all cash social security checks and go watch our alma mater win one when we are in our 70's. And then it would still be analogous to that other school. 

And if they happen to put together a team that wins with some kind of consistency, many of us will have to enjoy from our "sky boxes".

I'm not taking nothing away from the remarkably unprecedented run that the 'Canes have put together - winning 5 championships total in 20 years while playing for another four, since Nebraska coach Tom Osborne decided to go for two rather than tie UM with an extra point in an era where there was no overtime.

But there is no telling what will happen until the time comes, so let's sit back and be a little more realistic. 

I am not saying that FIU will or will not win their first title 54 years from now. They may win it sooner, who knows. 

But they have the advantage over UM in starting their program in a football-crazed era rather than in the depression-filled twenties that adored our national pastime, baseball. 

Whether or not they win a title in the next half century is uncertain, but there will be a realistic shot at winning in that span. 

Just all depends on if FIU learns how to win from now until that time comes.

Headline: Women's volleyball team cools down, drops two of three matches
Author: Harry Coleman/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Oct. 14- Villanova 3, FIU 0

With a 3-0 loss to Villanova on  Oct. 14, FIU lost its third game in a row.

The Wildcats won the first two sets of the match 30-25, 30-25 behind a strong game by Erin Birunas who had eight kills on a .438 hitting percentage.

In the third and final set, Katie Lanting provided a spark with five kills, finishing the game with 11, as Villanova won 30-27.

The match featured 30 tie scores and 15 lead changes, but didn't seem to affect FIU players.

"I didn't notice all the tie scores and lead changes. Even though we lost, I felt this game was our first comeback on the way we played," said Betsy Moreland who finished the match with 30 assists.

Head coach Cookie Stevens just saw all the tie scores and lead changes as part of the game.

"This game is very emotional. The momentum switches here and there. One second your team is up and then a couple of play after your team is down," said Stevens.

Jennifer Owens, who finished the game with 11 kills and four blocks, led FIU. Elizabeth Baldwin added 16 digs and Myriam Rodney added eight kills. With four kills, Julie Doan became the third Golden Panther this season behind Owens and Adriana Fundora to reach 200 kills on the year.

Oct. 14- North Texas 3, FIU 1

The Golden Panthers lost their fourth game in a row to North Texas on. Oct. 14 at the Golden Panther Arena.

The Mean Green defeated FIU 3-1 behind Sun Belt Preseason Player of the Year Corina Marginas, who led all totals with 22 kills.

Stevens saw first hand why Marginas won the honor last season.

"Its nice to have a go-to player like that who can put the ball away. We are looking for someone to be like that for us," said Stevens.

Fundora also noticed the strong play of Marginas.

"We had a hard time stopping Corina. I don't think our defense was stopping her. She is their key player and one of the Sun Belt top players," said Fundora.

FIU was led by a strong offensive performance by Fundora, who recorded her 12th double double of the year on 18 kills and 13 digs. FIU also found a spark of the bench as Charlyn Ball-Llovera recorded her first double double of the season  with 10 kills and 10 digs, while hitting a match high .360.

Stevens was especially proud of  the play of Ball-Lovera.

"She had an outstanding match. She did great and it's good for her because she has not been able to play much lately," said Stevens. "She gave our setter a lot of options, but we just came up short."

Despite the loss, Ball-Llovera said she sees signs of improvement, as FIU was not swept as they were against Villanova and Western Kentucky recently.

"Losing three straight sets is really hard on us and it shows us we don't fight during the game, but we really do fight. We have to take it game by game, and that's the thing with volleyball, you can't look ahead," said Ball-Llovera.

Stevens also knows her team needs to say away from straight-set losses. 

"This is where we have to be tougher. My team needs to perform and be more aggressive and get the job done," said Stevens, who refused to make excuses for her team's losing streak.

FIU, which started the season red hot, has struggled of late, and the players realize something is wrong.

"We started off so awesome and we were expecting great things. It's frustrating because we don't think we are playing horrible. It's just we are not clicking and doing the right things at certain times," said Fundora

Added Stevens: "Its horrible and it stinks to lose four straight. We are trying to find ways to turn it around."

After the fourth straight loss, Moreland sees the games as an experience and plans to turn things around.

"After that Western Kentucky loss, Villanova was a step for us and now North Texas was. We are going to bounce back from this," said Moreland, who provided 51 assists against North Texas.

Oct. 19- FIU 3, UL-L 0

The volleyball team finally got back on track, defeating conference rival Louisiana-Lafayette 3-0 on Oct. 19 at the Golden Panther Arena.

The Golden Panthers were led by Julie Doan, who recorded 13 kills and four block assists. She also led the team with a .552 hitting percentage, a team season-high.

"The key in this match was our high hitting percentage," said head coach Cookie Stevens, whose team outhit the Rajin' Cajuns .270-.098 in the match.

Adriana Fundora recorded her 13th double-double of the season, totalling 12 kills and 13 digs. 

Betsy Moreland had 38 assists, moving into third place all-time on FIU's single-season assist list with 926.

FIU won in straight sets, 30-27, 30-16 and 30-21 to improve to 11-9 on the season.

The team next plays at New Mexico State on Oct. 23, followed by another road game against Denver on Oct. 25.

Headline: Blown opportunities cost FIU
Subheadline: Golden Panthers struggle to convert in red zone
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
They came close once again. They played up to their competition and almost sent 19,000 fans home sulking to a homecoming loss at the hands of 1-AA FIU in Movie Gallery Stadium on Oct. 18.

FIU's defense showed improvement - albeit going from allowing just over 300 yards rushing last week to enabling the Trojans to rush for 204 - in their 21-10 loss to Troy State. The Golden Panthers fell behind early and battled back late to make a game out of what many thought would not be close.

"We just didn't play smart today," FIU coach Don Strock told the Sun-Sentinel afterwards. "We had a lot of missed opportunities, especially on offense. You can't do that and win, especially on the road."

Trailing 21-10 in the third quarter FIU (0-7) put together its longest drive of the game, a 76-yard, nine play march that put them at the Trojans' one-yard line. Quarterback Josh Padrick scrambled for an eight-yard gain on third down to put the Panthers in prime position to score.

That is if Padrick didn't score himself. The redshirt freshman was ruled to be just shy of the goal line by the back judge. "I got in [the end zone], but the referees said that my feet got in, and the ball was twisted around," the Merritt Island native said. 

Backup quarterback David Tabor entered to spell Padrick after the run and had his pass attempt to tailback Rashod Smith on fourth-and-one deflected by TSU strong safety Rayshun Reed. 

FIU's defense, which despite struggling mightily at times, has been able to play with some of the Panthers' tougher opponents. This game was no different, but the story that is beginning to become played out like an old record is that one side of the ball succeeds while the other falls short. 

Troy State (4-3) took over on the one and began marching in the opposite direction in search of a score that would begin to tug at FIU's jugular. The Trojans were unsuccessful and FIU got the ball back in TSU territory. 

FIU's drive, which started at the TSU 49 eventually was halted at the 27. 

Kicker Adam Moss, who set a record with his 47-yarder last week against Stephen F. Austin, came in to attempt a 44-yard field goal. The American Heritage graduate missed the kick wide-left and FIU's last realistic scoring chance was squandered. Should Moss have made the field goal, FIU would have trailed 21-13.

Instead TSU controlled the clock, 36:51 to 23:09, and went on to defeat FIU, who plays Holy Cross in Community Stadium at 10 a.m. in order to accommodate NBC's local telecast.

"We didn't play well on offense at all again this week," Strock told the Miami Herald. "We just weren't prepared for today."

TSU scored two touchdowns within seven minutes of each other in the first and second quarters to jump out ahead of FIU 14-0. 

Padrick, who completed 17-of-31 passes for 212 yards, led FIU downfield on six plays. A 20-yard pass to receiver Cory McKinney got the Panthers deep into TSU territory.

Moss was called upon once the drive stalled to nail a 34-yard field goal when FIU could not pass the TSU 17.

"We had little mistakes," said Padrick, who, according to Strock, has had trouble reading defenses at times. "We had big chances for plays, but I didn't read them right...so I guess they were blown chances."

A Gerrod Bodie interception at the beginning of the second half helped FIU set-up its only touchdown and final scoring drive of the afternoon. 

Smith, who did not muster much yardage on the ground, capped a six-play, 1:37 drive with a 3-yard touchdown run. Following Moss' extra point, TSU's lead shrunk to 14-10.

However, the Trojans answered back - increasing their lead to 11. 

TSU runningback DeWhitt Betterson punched it in from one-yard out to end the Trojans' punishing nine-play, 80-yard drive.
