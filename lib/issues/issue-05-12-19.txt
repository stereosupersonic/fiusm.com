Headline: Ambition led student to graduate
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
During his four-year college career at the Biscayne Bay Campus, Rogell Levers's favorite past time was playing dominoes in the recreation area located on the second floor of the Wolfe University Center.

"BBC is home because I get the feel of being back in the islands. We played Dominoes. We did the same things we do in the Caribbean," said Levers, who is graduating with a 3.4 GPA.

Levers traveled from his hometown in Kingston, Jamaica to FIU to pursue a degree in political science as an international student. But he wasn't alone. He brought his immediate family along for the journey. 

"I chose FIU because it's an urban university which is considered number one to international students … my family came with me, so I didn't really miss anybody, but it was difficult to adapt to new surroundings," he said. 

Like most freshmen, he got lost - on campus and in his community.

"I got lost in my own neighborhood. Sometimes I would pass my house, and I wouldn't even recognize it," said Levers, who is the second person in his family to obtain a college degree. 

His freshman year was also difficult because he was forced to pay for classes as an international student and didn't receive any scholarship money. 

"I had to take out international loans and pay about $13,000 per semester, so you really appreciate it when you become a [Florida] resident," he said. 

But leadership, ambition and a clear mind kept Levers on the path to graduation.

Besides majoring in political science, Levers minored in business administration and psychology and earned a certificate in law, ethics and society. 

He also served as director of alumni relations for the Student Government Association at BBC, the president of the Student Alumni Association, and as a student ambassador. 

"He was a lot of trouble but in a good way, and SGA will miss him a lot," said Lemar Linton, vice-president of SGA at BBC.

Levers was a peer advisor from 2003 through 2005 and received the Outstanding Student Life award last year for his dedication and leadership at FIU. He was on the Dean's List at FIU and at the national level for the past two years.

But the accomplishment he is most fond of is turning his internship at the State Legislature's Office into a real job. 

Yolly Roberson, a state representative at the SLO, noticed Levers's hard work and dedication.

"She had to plan for an upcoming health fair and wanted to get the information out to the people. She told me that I came up with very different marketing techniques," he said. 

In the future, Levers would like to pursue a law career and is considering the FIU Law School as one of his top choices. Not only will Levers obtain a degree from FIU, but he will also be taking with him a bundle of life-long networks and stories. 

"You only have one time in college, so make as many experiences as you can … things you can tell your grandchildren about when you get old," he said.

Headline: Cuban couple to graduate together
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Peggy and Antonio De Cardena never knew their paths would cross many years after they had both left their homes in Cuba; that they would have some of the highest GPA's in their graduating class, and that they would marry.

Before moving to Miami, Antonio's family lived in Mozambique, Cuba where he studied to become a physician and worked for Doctors Without Borders, a European Foundation to assist third-world countries with medical care.

Peggy also became a doctor, studied in her home of Santiago, Cuba and moved to Miami in 2000.

By the time they arrived in Miami both were certified doctors, but their foreign degrees didn't hold up under the American Board.

They met through a mutual friend in 2000, and married shortly after in December of 2001.

"We met because Peggy was very disoriented when she got her. She needed help finding her way around," Antonio said.

Once married, they decided to return to school, hoping to get their bachelor's in nursing.

Joining a group called Foreign Physicians, both managed to return to school in 2001. They will both be graduating with GPA's above a 3.6.

Both Antonio and Peggy attended school full-time while also juggling work in medical coding and billing, respectively, full-time.

"It was very hard to work and go to school, but we helped each other with projects and tried to study together. We took our classes very seriously from the beginning. We never left anything to be done tomorrow," Antonio said.

The process for earning a degree was especially difficult for the students since they had to learn English and start their education from the beginning as if they had never attended college in their own countries.

"We had to start from scratch. It is hard to come to a country when you are already a doctor, knowing you have already worked so hard to earn your degree only to find that it isn't acceptable. We received a lot of attitude from many people who did not respect all the hard work we had already done to become physicians," Antonio said.

While in Mozambique, Antonio worked for the prevention of AIDS and the education of poorer, lower class citizens in matters of medicine. 

"Education is the only way to better yourself in any way. It is very important to continue your education," he said. 

After graduation, Peggy and Antonio plan to begin practicing nursing in a local hospital while they continue school. They hope to get an internship in the Intensive Care Unit at Cedars Hospital in Miami.

They also plan on going to a Nurse Practioner Program where they hope to acquire their Master's in the field.

Before they continue, they will be taking a vacation.

"We are going to Argentiina to visit friends and family. We really need a vacation after all of this - we have worked very hard," Antonio said.

Headline: Athlete excelled in classroom, football field
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer

As a member of the first year practice team, Ed Wenger knew what it was like to work hard to achieve his goal. 

As a graduate student, his final football season didn't go as planned. But even through adversity, he achieved his goals. 

Wenger came into this football season with high hopes. He had been a part of the inaugural football team, started every game the Golden Panthers had played up to that point and was a three time recipient of the team's Academic Excellence Award. 

Everything seemed to be going his way this season.

Wenger was a semi-finalist for the Draddy Award, an award also known as the Academic Heisman that encompasses academic success, performance on the field and community leadership. He was also selected as a finalist for the Wuerffel Award, which honors a college football player who best combines exemplary community service with outstanding academic and athletic achievement. 

On the field, everything seemed to be falling into place as well. 

Wenger led the team on trips to Kansas State and Texas Tech, playing in front of crowds he had only dreamed of in the past. Against North Texas however, his entire way of thinking would change. 

Wenger suffered his second concussion in two weeks and was ruled out for the rest of the year. The injury would end his football career and completely change the way he looked at life. 

"It was absolutely crushing," Wenger said. "For a while it took me a long time to deal with it. It definitely wasn't the way I would have liked to finish my career." 

Wenger admits that from a young age, football had been everything that ran through his mind. 

"[Football] has been the focal point in my life since I was 13 -years- old," he said. "The average student on the street doesn't realize what type of commitment it takes to play at the Division I level. There are a lot of sacrifices which have to be made in order to succeed both in football and school. As long as you are doing well in school, football can be your number one priority."

However, when playing football was taken away from him, Wenger decided he didn't have to give it up completely. 

"I kept on thinking, 'I have come this far, I have to have a chance to finish.' Some things are just out of your control and unfortunately that was one of them," Wenger said. 

The dedication he had shown as a player was not lost.

"I felt that [since] I had given everything I could on the field, the only right thing to do was to help out some of the younger players. It was pretty much the hardest thing I have ever had to accept - knowing that I had to stop playing before I wanted to." 

Wenger has since applied for law school and doesn't know where he'll end up yet. He will graduate this Fall semester with a Master's in criminal justice and hopes the lessons he learned while playing football will help him in his future career. 

"I came to FIU because it was an opportunity to start a tradition," Wenger said. "It was a place where I could leave my mark on a program that was up and coming. I wanted to see if I could positively influence future Golden Panthers. I knew that with the red shirt year, I would have the opportunity to finish my master's in five years."

Headline: Student shined through art
Author: Vanessa Bastien / Contributing Writer

When artist Yvette Rodriguez graduates this Fall semester, she knows that her time at FIU will be well remembered.

Many of her posters - including some showing her views on the war in Iraq - have been displaced around University Park.

Some controversial ones included a green gas masque on the crosswalk panels and a poster with the words "gimme, gimme, gimme," and another that featured a picture of the White House with the phrase "House of Terror" on it.

"It represents the lines of terror that the government shows on TV when the country is in a high stated alert. The colors on the posters mean that," said Rodriguez, who is graduating with a GPA over 3.0 from the College of Arts and Sciences.

She picked the war in Iraq as her theme for the exhibit because of media bias and self-expression. 

"TV tends to be biased on stories about the war. I wanted to illustrate to people the other pictures the media does not show but we are all aware of," Rodriguez said.

Her childhood passion originated from cartoons and comic books, which motivated her to make posters.

Rodriguez's favorite artist is John Hartfield. During World War II, Hartfield put up posters in Germany showing his displeasure. He was later forced to flee the country due to his messages.

Most students have that one special professor who made their college experience all more inspiring and interesting. For Rodriguez, that person is professor Clive King. 

"I owe a lot to him," she said. "He always guided me in the right path and supported my work. Even though I am not in his class anymore, he still makes himself available and supports me."

For the future generation of art students at FIU, Rodriguez advises to reach for your goal. 

"Keep working hard, don't ever give up. Pay attention to your surroundings and practice, practice, practice," she said. 

Rodriguez's most memorable moments include staying in the art studio painting, drawing, and talking with friends all through the night.

After graduation, she plans on going to New York and putting together some art shows. The title of the show is "Stop the War" and will highlight seven artists featuring their posters, paintings and pictures.

Rodriguez's work is currently on display at the Frost Art Museum until Dec. 26.
