Headline: Trouble in Dolphin Country?
Subheadline: Golden Panther head coach Don Strock took verbal potshots at Miami Dolphin head coach Dave Wannstedt. Upon hearing of Strock's criticism, Wannstedt tackled the issue and questioned Strock's ties to the Dolphins
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With a struggling Miami Dolphin football team in town, many former Dolphin players have been taking verbal potshots at the team and the coaching ability of head coach Dave Wannstedt. 

A player bashing their former team is not out of the norm but when coaches begin to question other coaches' motives, that's when it becomes unusual.

In his weekly show, FIU head coach Don Strock spoke critically of the Dolphins' strategies this season and of the leadership of Wannstedt. As a former player, Strock doesn't like what is happening to the Dolphins.

"I played there 15 years. I hate to see what's going on," Strock said on his radio show.

During the show heard on ESPN 790AM on Wednesdays, Strock suggested that Wannstedt is too laid back with his players.  

"[He] may have lost a major part of this team," said Strock, who was a longtime backup quarterback for the Fins.

Strock also mentioned how ex Dolphin head coach Don Shula would have never allowed leaks of the team to reach the media and how Shula would be tougher on players.

Strock criticized the trade for A.J. Feely and how the Dolphins didn't bring any free agents to upgrade the team. 

The Dolphins offensive line has been a key problem for the team this season. Strock didn't speak highly of Damion McIntosh who was brought in by the Dolphins to fill holes on the offensive line. 

Strock wondered how can a player, McIntosh, who played for a very bad team in San Diego be the answer to players the Dolphins weren't able to get. He suggested the Dolphins should have landed a player like Damien Woody who is considered one of the best at the position.

As a quarterback in college and the NFL, Strock used his experience to say the Dolphins passing game won't get it done.

"Throwing a four yard pass on third and seven . . . is not going to win in the NFL," Strock said.

Throughout his NFL career, Strock was known for coming into games when the starter was struggling. Wannstedt began the season with Jay Fiedler starting but switched to Feeley and now back to Fiedler. 

Strock doesn't see how switching back and forth between the two quarterbacks being good for the team. 

How Wannstedt switches his quarterback is different than what Strock used to do and Strock is also bothered by the flip-flopping of quarterbacks.

Wannstedt didn't appreciate  Strock's comments. The Miami Dolphins have had an 11 and ten game winning season during Wannstedt's first two years and Strock never made a complementary comment.

''I've only been here six years, and I didn't realize that Don had that strong of a relationship and ties with the Dolphins,'' Wannstedt told The Miami Herald. 

``I'll have to look back when we won 10 and 11 games and check my notes about my past phone calls of encouragement. 

Wannstedt said Strock used the comments as a way to promote himself.

"I've been coaching 30 years, and one thing you don't do is try to promote your own agenda by criticizing another team anywhere, coaches, or other players," Wannstedt said.

Wannstedt wasn't the only one answering Strock about his comments. Miami Herald columnist and football expert Greg Cote wrote an Insider column a message to the FIU coach.

"The Insider likes Don Strock, the erstwhile famous Dolphins backup QB and current FIU coach. 

That's why the Insider would have offered the following advice before Strock, a man of limited resume as a coach, went on the air to blast Dave Wannstedt the other day: Shhhhh!

Headline: Lady Golden Panthers continue to struggle
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The lady Golden Panthers suffered a distressing loss to rival Florida Atlantic University after coming back from two games down only to lose the fifth game, 15-12, on Sept. 29 at the FAU Gymnasium. 

The loss only adds to the frustrations of the Golden Panthers as their record drops to 1-11, as well as breaking their three game winning streak versus the lady Owls who are 10-2 this season.

With the loss, however, came some good, including valiant performances from some FIU players. Junior Anna Dmowska led the way with a career high 22 kills and fellow junior Laura Vogel tied her career high with another 12 kills. Sophomore Oksana Zabalueva also finished strong by adding 12 kills, a season high as well.

In set one, FAU came out with a dominant performance by winning 30-19 victory in a game with only two lead changes. Vogel went a perfect 5-for-5 attacking for FIU. Game two was another win for the Owls, 30-26, in a game that mirrored the first with only two lead changes. Dmowska led the second set for FIU with five kills and no errors.

Losing the first two sets was discouraging for coach Cookie Stevens.

"I was very disappointed and upset in the way we came out. I thought we would have been prepared," said Stevens. "They should have been ready to play. It's disappointing the way we performed the first two games."

In set three, FIU turned it around with a 30-25 win in a set where both teams were hitting remarkably well. Dmowska again led FIU with a set-high seven kills. Senior Jessica Jones added to the attack with three aces and another five kills.

Stevens saw a better team on the floor during the third set.

"The third game we fought back, we were sharper," Stevens said.

The Golden Panther followed its momentum with 30-23 win in the forth set tied that tied match and forced a deciding fifth game. To no surprise, Dmowska led the way for FIU by adding another six kills. 

In set five however, things slipped away from the Golden Panthers as the Owls got match point with a 14-9 lead. FIU showed some resilience by then scoring 3 consecutive points, but it was too late. FAU rallied back and put the game away sending the Golden Panthers to its 11 loss of the season. 

Despite the comeback to send the game into a fifth set, Stevens doesn't want her team to fight back, they need to built leads.

"We came back in the middle but we shouldn't put ourselves in that position. I will keep pushing them," Stevens said. 

Failing to start strong is what is hurt the team in the fifth set.

"We had a good start and momentum but we faltered," Stevens said. "It was a short game to 15 and we failed."

Headline: Abercrombie model lays the hit on opposing players
Author: Natalie Sabia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Standing proud in his blue and gold uniform, glaring down toward his opponents, who have no idea what they are in for, defensive back John Haritan is not only in the spotlight on the football field, but he also shines in the glare of a camera. 

The Golden Panther safety not only picked up over 20 tackles in the first game of the season proving how tough he is, but the defensive back is also a star model.

Standing at six feet, 200 pounds, Haritan leaves football practice thinking about not only his possible career as an athlete, but maybe his modeling career.  

"I never really thought about modeling, but I have a ton of fun doing it," said Haritan who led FIU in tackles in both 2002 and 2003.

Sporting number 31, Haritan works hard on both the football field, while awaiting another potential season of modeling.  After appearing in last year's national advertising campaign for Abercrombie and Fitch, Haritan has now realized there may be more modeling in his near future due to his prior success.  

Despite a busy schedule balancing football practice and school, Haritan explained how he doesn't participate in any modeling until football season is over.  

"During season, I don't do any modeling," Haritan said. "Football and school come first."

Born and raised in Casselberry, FL, which is just north of Orlando, Haritan was involved in modeling in high school, along with being named The Orlando Sentinel's Seminole County Defensive Player of the year in 2000. 

 "In high school I modeled a little, but then it got bigger in college," said Haritan who has also been featured on Ocean Drive Magazine.

As a freshman at FIU, John adapted very quickly on the field; he was named the First Team All-Independent after leading his team with 86 tackles.  While Haritan was very active with the football team, he also met an agent who recruited him to model in Miami, while still attending FIU.  Behind the camera, being shy is not a trait of Haritan.

"When it comes to the camera I'm not shy at all,"  Haritan said.

Growing up wanting to be a model was far from Haritan's mind as a child; he always thought he would spend his time as an athlete. 

 "Since I was ten, I always thought I'd play football," Haritan said.  

Coming to Miami to fulfill his dreams of football and playing for the Golden Panthers, has been a dream for Haritan.

"It's awesome down here and it's a beautiful campus," Haritan said.

Now entering his junior year at FIU, the Criminal Justice major is still excited at the thought of picking  up his modeling career, after another successful season of football and moreover the opportunity to play Division I-A football. 

 "I want to try and help the team a lot this season," Haritan said.

Whether he is flirting with the camera beneath the flashes of a camera, or getting down and dirty on the football field, Haritan is sure about one thing: he will be successful at what he does, no matter what it is.  

Nothing less can be expected from a player who compiled a 39-1 record in high school as a wrestler.

"It's all in the works right now," said Haritan who hopes he can standout in both modeling and the football field.

Headline: Policians must heed call to continue assault weapons ban
Author: Jamie Blanco / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
One day after the expiration of a decade old assault weapons ban, Miami-Dade police officer Keenya Hubert escaped with her life after being shot by a man wielding what's believed to be an AK-47.

Twenty-four rounds were fired, far more than the typical 10 round clips available before the ban. Officer Hubert was hit in the head and shoulder, her police car set ablaze by the amount of bullets pumped into it. Fortunately, she is expected to make a full recovery.

"This shooting attests to the potential harm and danger from high-powered weapons," declared Miami-Dade Police director Robert Parker at a press conference the following day. "These are weapons of murder."

This is only the first ominous reminder of what police must face more of now that 19 types of military style weapons and American-made copycat weapons, many with stealth cosmetic features, are available for sale to civilians. 

Many have larger magazines that hold more bullets as well.

As the Associated Press demonstrated in an interview, some gunsmiths are ready and eager to sell copycat models of U.S. military standard-issue M-16s.  This gun, called a Colt AR-15, was banned in 1994 but can be sold today.

What keeps these weapons from falling into the wrong hands? 

Allowing the ban to die only makes it easier for these assault weapons to find their way into the hands of criminals, drug dealers, and mentally unstable, depressed or violent individuals. 				    It's only a matter of time before we hear about another incident like the 1997 Los Angeles Bank robbery in which two men with illegally modified fully and semi-automatic weapons Held off 320 police officers for hours, wounding a dozen before they were finally taken down. They fired 75 rounds a minute, showing no regard for human life.

There's no practical purpose for a civilian to have such a powerful weapon.

You can't eat a dear shot full of holes and allowing assault weapons ensures that more accidents will happen, not only in hunting, but also in the home. 

As the rate of domestic violence and sexual battery increases in the city of Miami, so does the risk of possible violent deaths by high-powered weapons if they are in the home. Dangerous individuals don't always have original records to begin with and may acquire a weapon without incident.

The 2nd Amendment protects our right to defend our homes, not to procure dangerous weapons to hang on the walls as ego enhancements. Americans do not need more than a handgun to defend themselves.

Even gun enthusiasts, like FIU alumnus and registered gun owner Lazaro Blanco, remain concerned. "Where are they going to shoot 300 or 600 rounds a minute? They'll go shoot illegally in the Everglades or go showing off and then someone is going to get hurt," Blanco said.

Strong distribution laws still exist for gun retailers. But it's not the retailer who submit to these processes that I worry so much about. It's the guns that make it into the wrong hands with new features available to make them even more lethal.

Gun Violence in Dade County as a whole has dropped dramatically in the past 10 years. Youth  gun-related death is down 50 percent, so why jeopardize a good thing?

With higher capacity magazines for guns, aren't we giving that percentage of gun criminals more chances to hit their intended targets?

The bill killed in the House of Representatives was an expansion of the previous ban, aimed to remove copycat weapons still being sold with minor cosmetic changes. Although 68 percent of Americans supported the bill, according to the University of Pennsylvania's National Annenberg Election Survey, it was not even brought up for vote.

ABC news learned that the National Rifle Association, a powerful gun lobby, promised to endorse President Bush's reelection campaign only after the ban expired.

What's truly sad is that the Democrats are just as willing to see the issue die to ensure the delicate status of their presidential hopeful and congressional candidates. 

They haven't forgotten how instrumental the NRA was in electing a Republican majority to Congress after the passing of the original ban.

Politicians must realize that in martyring this bill for the sake of politics they risk more gun deaths each year.  If they have the audacity to presume that a few more gun deaths each year is a risk worth taking, they are wrong.  year is a risk worth taking, they are wrong.

Headline: Independents hold separate debates
Author: Mark Scopetta / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The nation's TVs tuned into the debate between President Bush and Senator John Kerry on Sept. 30, but under their noses, another debate was taking place: the other guys' debate.

Across the street from the University of Miami's Convocation Center and the media circus created by Bush/Kerry 2004, in a small, purple and green Holiday Inn, preparations were made for the gathering of two otherwise ignored political groups, the Libertarian and the Green parties.

As 5 p.m. approached, audience members gathered outside Inn's Banquet Hall. Unlike the freshly pressed suits and polished shoes of the major debate across the street, this audience mainly consisted of men and women wearing t-shirts and blue jeans. A woman with half of her hair dyed blue stood dressed in camouflage, her eleven-year-old son wearing a t-shirt that read, "Revolutionaries always spoil the party. Vote Nader 2004."

Ten minutes before the debate, the candidates, David Cobb of the Green Party and Michael Badnarik for the Libertarians, made their appearance and began to work the crowd. They called the volunteers by name and even acknowledged a few of the spectators. Their navy suits were a contrast to the plain clothes of the people with whom they spoke. 

Badnarik, before the start of the debate, was stopped an older man with braided hair who asked if they'd be getting a "more real showing than the infomercial across the street."

"I'd like to think so," said Badnarik. 

The event began shortly after 5 p.m. with an attendance of just below 50. John B. Anderson, the keynote speaker, was a third party presidential candidate in the 1980 election who received six million votes. He now serves as the chair of the Center for Voting and Democracy, one of the event's sponsors. 

"Sadly, I am the reason that these two candidates aren't speaking across the street," said Anderson amidst the chuckles from the crowd. Though partially joking, Anderson explained that after his debate with President Jimmy Carter and then-Governor Ronald Reagan,  the Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, the group that now keeps third parties out.

The debate began with opening statements from both candidates.

Badnarik spoke first and touched on some of the key policies he would address if elected president. 

"Those candidates have walked the line too long. If elected President, I would abolish the Patriot Act and get rid of the idea of free speech zones," he said, referring to the zones designated as free speech areas during Presidential National Conventions. 

Cobb, upon taking the floor, spoke with fire and intensity. 

"This event is about real democracy. We have oil corporations dictating our energy policy and influencing our foreign policy. Our troops in Iraq need to come home."

After the introductory statements, the floor was opened to questions from the audience. 

One question asked about the war in Iraq and, if elected, what each candidate planned on doing to help the situation.

"We need to stop breeding terror and get the hell out of Iraq," said Cobb. When pressed futher on how he planned to do that, Cobb spoke about the need for international intervention and the need for a stronger Iraqi police force.

Badnarik responded, "We can do one of three things about Iraq; we can stay there and lose more American lives; we can kill all the Iraqis who live there and honestly say that no one in Iraq hates us; or we can bring our troops home. We should have never sent our troops to Iraq and I believe that we should bring them home."

Regarding the decriminalization of marijuana both candidates had a similar stance on the issue.

"First of all, I want to dispel a rumor that Libertarians are pro-drugs. We are not pro-drugs; we are anti drug war," said Badnarik. He also said that the war on drugs is a violation of our civil liberties.	

Cobb responded, "There is a war going on, folks, and it is a war on people. Those people are overwhelmingly poor and people of color who are being incarcerated for a profit. When we start to look underneath, the war on drugs is a dismal failure."

Overall, the two parties stood in solidarity, arguing their purpose for the pursuit of free speech.

"They call third party candidates spoilers of elections. Well, I call them participators in elections," said Cobb. The audience cheered. "They're trying to squelch our voice but we're only getting stronger."

Headline: Colombian president discusses country's problems
Author: Amanda Ramírez Castañeda / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A mass of Colombians waited outside the doors of University Park's Wertheim Performing Arts Center in the morning heat on September 30 to catch Colombian President Alvaro Uribe Vélez's address. 

His visit to FIU is part of Uribe's tour of conversatorios, or open forums, which usually take place on Saturdays in Colombia, in which President Uribe listens to the Colombian community, addressing their opinions and concerns.  

Visitors entered the building to the rhythm of bambuco (traditional Colombian music) and filled the seats on both levels of the concert hall.  Brilliant yellows, blues and reds-the colors of the Colombian flag-decorated the room.

After a brief welcome by University President Modesto Maidique and a standing ovation, Uribe and his council members answered pre-selected questions obtained thru the internet and from audience members and those obtained via e-mail.

Issues included Colombia's economy, its fight against terrorism and immigration. 

"Unfortunately, the terrorism in Colombia is funded by drug money. This has made the disintegration of terrorism in our country very difficult," Uribe said.

Uribe recently lobbied the United States government to support his Plan Colombia, which aims to create peace and a better quality of life for the people of Colombia.  Uribe stressed the importance of continuing Plan Colombia regardless of who is elected to office in Colombia or the U.S. in the upcoming elections.

"It would be very dangerous to leave [Plan Colombia] where it is today because although we have debilitated the snake, that snake is still alive," President Uribe said, using his favorite epithet for guerrillas and terrorists.

During the symposium the President denied any association with the violent groups threatening his country.  

"Colombia cannot commit the same mistakes.  We cannot be in favor of the paramilitaries or the guerillas. The greatest interest of the government is for objectivity and transparency to exist," he said. 

When questioned about his reelection chances, Uribe didnot say whether he would run for office again but made clear he would not rule out the option in light of Columbia's longstanding problem with narcoterrorism.

"One term is not enough to stop the terrorism problem in Colombia," Uribe said. "The people of Colombia have [traditionally] felt abandoned by their governments and I do not want that to happen again. I am working to reestablish credibility in the Colombian Government," the President explained.

During two hours Uribe tried to answer all questions. Some of his council members went into the crowd and spoke one-on-one with audience members. Uribe called audience members on to the stage and, on various occasions, he even resorted to using his cell phone to consult with people who could better assess a specific inquiry.

Diana Mendez, secretary of the Columbian Student Association at FIU, was satisfied by the degree to which Uribe made himself accessible.

"The conversatorios have made the Colombian community support him.  No other president in the history of Colombia had demonstrated such an interest in what the Colombian community has to say," Mendez said.

Headline: Speakers rally students for political cause
Author: Rodolfo R. Roman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Through joint efforts made by the university's College Democrats, members of the Democratic Party and various Veteran associations, the John Kerry campaign trail known as "The Donkey Tour" made its way into FIU on Sept. 30.

The audience, which consisted of 200 students, war veterans, university faculty and local residents, packed the stairs leading to University Park's Primera Casa building, holding signs and yelling their support for the Massachusetts senator turned presidential candidate.

Many well-known figures of the Democratic Party attended the event including Florida Representative Kendrick Meek; Senator Max Cleland; Party chairman Terry McAuliffe; Kerry's war companion, Del Sanduski and Hialeah mayor Raul Martinez.

The rally made itself evident throughout the school. Pamphlets, Spanish bumper stickers reading "No mas Bush" (No more Bush) and signs carrying the motto "Veterans for Kerry" inundated the space between PC and the FIU Fountain. The speakers informed students on Kerry's political agenda, advising them to cast their votes and make a "positive decision" on Nov. 2: Vote Kerry to oust Bush.

"There are 27 million young voters who need to vote to take this man out and avoid the departure of more soldiers to Iraq," said Cleland, who urged students to vote for Kerry out of fear of a national war draft. "This country should go to war not because it needs to, but when it needs to."

 With drinking water to help with the heat, professors and students gathered in the 90-degree-plus weather to hear the speakers voice their opinions, each having their own reason for attending.

"I am a hardcore Democrat," said history professor John Coombs. "I tell my students, 'Watch the debate, then vote for who you think will help us.'"

War veterans cheered and chanted, "Kerry, Kerry," as they sat on the sides of the stage put in place specifically for the event. 

Luis Valencia, sitting in that special area, said he supported Kerry over Bush because of the senator's Vietnam war record.

Aside from war comparisons, issues such as international politics and homeland security were eventually raised.

 "It's important students vote for Kerry because students are smart enough to know that change is good. [Kerry] has been around the world and the only way to defeat terrorism is by fighting with allies. He knows the right people to deal with," Cleland said.

In what some might call the other side of the coin, Republicans held their own rally in front of the Graham Center. Speakers included Peter Cabrera, candidate for Mayor of Doral and alumnus Gabriel Martin, candidate for Public Defender. All spoke on the importance of voting for Bush.

Despite these guests, though, the club admitted to having some setbacks in the organization of the rally.

"It was tough for us to have this event possible because of the lack of space. The Democrats had their rally and many rooms [had been] used as hurricane shelters, but we were fortunate enough to send the message to the FIU community-the positivism of Bush," said Juan F. D'Arce Jr., president of the FIU College Republicans.

Covering the rails of GC with Bush-Cheney posters, volunteers also passed out many stickers and shirts to passersby. 

"I studied here, and I was involved in the committee of bringing the law school to FIU," said Martinez as he began to speak about his own plans for office. "As public defender, I plan to open the doors for those who graduate. I plan to have more intern positions and open doors for students who are fresh out of school."

At both rallies, speakers told their audience to reach out and inform friends and family about the importance of voting.

"Take time off of studying and tell your neighbor or roommate to vote. It doesn't matter for whom, just vote," said Meek at the Democratic rally.

After the speeches, students in the attendance chanted and applaud for their respective parties as they disassembled, prepared to see the candidates face off at their first presidential debate on that very night.

Many Bush supporters later took part of the post-debate festivities held at the Coconut Grove Convention Center while Democrats celebrated their own candidate downtown at a special rally held in the Miami Arena.

Headline: Candidate showdown offers more of the same propaganda
Author: Danny Muela / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In the spirit of fair and concise journalism, I will attempt to keep my comments neutral and not reveal that I am in fact going to vote for Nadar and that all of you are communists for not letting him debate.

This election is obviously going to be one of the closest in this nation's history. This year, the election is about more than trivial tax cuts and White House intern's administering fellatio. 

The stakes are high. Our nation is at war and the billions of dollars being spent on it are throwing us further and further into the deficit. This is not World War II. Hell, this isn't even Grenada. 

Americans need to realize that party loyalty has to take a back seat to what is needed in this country; leadership. Whether you're Republican, Democrat, Independent, or Amish, you need to start listening to what these candidates have to say instead of what party they belong to. 

If you just happened to stay with the debates long enough to hear all the post-debate coverage, you might have noticed something very odd. 

All the Democrats thought that Senator Kerry had finally picked a stance and was beating President Bush into red paste when he had to play defense and never really got the chance to chase the good Senator off. 

Republicans were convinced that Senator Kerry was lecturing his audience while President Bush was candidly speaking to the America, never wavering, no matter how strong the wind blew.

This debate did get some things right. There were seldom moments of gritty, balls to the wall, hot, hardcore political action. 

It gave the American public a chance to see how both candidates stand on the very important topic of foreign policy. 

Senator Kerry believes that the world no longer respects us and that we should finish our duties in Iraq as soon as possible and get our soldiers back. President Bush feels very strongly about the Polish war machine and that chocolate will rain down from the heavens and so on and so forth.

But overall, the debate was pretty dull. There were no home runs, touchdowns, goals or what ever you do in Jai-Alai to score. The candidates played small ball.      

But, asking this debate to be something ground-breaking is like asking a high school production of Othello to win a Tony. 

And it's a shame because in a time when most voters would like to see the candidates naked. It'd be great to see them without their prepackaged sound bytes and just have them go at it. 

Unfortunately, what we got was two political advertisements running opposite one another.   

This debate probably won't decide who becomes president. Only after being grouped with the two other upcoming debates will it really find its place. It was an interesting discussion, but it really didn't prove much. 

Both candidates held their ground, both showed confidence in their leadership abilities, and both had really nice suits on.

Looks like the people who will make or break this election are the undecided voters. It's a shame that undecided voters are left in the dust. 

For the uninformed, it's pretty difficult to decide which rhetoric they should buy when a debate boils down to two guys shouting, "I can do it better than he can!" and "Everything you just said is a complete lie. I'm right." 

It's much easier to just vote for your party and move on with your life. 

This is exactly what we need to stay away from. Don't be afraid to break out of your democratic habit if President Bush says something you like. 

Don't call everyone a communist if they even think about voting for Kerry. 

Unfortunately, these scripted debates don't have any content besides the propaganda we've been hearing for the past six months. 

But, that doesn't mean that you can't research it yourself. There are numerous information sources all over the Internet where you can research the candidates.

 Sure, most of it is just more propaganda, but it's very concise propaganda and you don't have to miss your "Sanford and Son" reruns.

Well, at least next week we get to watch the vice presidential debates. 	   Make sure to tune in next week to see Vice President Cheney head-butt Senator Edwards for having a "Fruity haircut."

Headline: Firefighter flick burns with heated action
Author: Roger Moore / The Orlando Sentinel
&nbsp;
"Ladder 49" is a solid, old-fashioned fire-fighting melodrama. It's a string of sentimental snapshots of a firefighter's life told in flashback as he and his crew fight for his life in a towering inferno where he has been trapped.

Every cliche in every movie or TV show about firemen is recycled here, but often to pleasant effect. 

A comfortable leading-man turn by Joaquin Phoenix, a professional supporting performance by John Travolta and a knowing way with the fires themselves don't make for cutting-edge drama. But it makes a nice counter-balance to the edgier, more corrosive R-rated fireman's soap opera "Rescue Me" now showing on FX.

Phoenix's character, Jack Morrison, takes a tumble in a grain elevator fire in Baltimore. And as firemen led by his chief, Travolta, struggle to find him and cut him free, he and they recall his career as a fireman.

The rookie hazing (led by veteran Robert Patrick), the smooth "I'm a firefighter" pick-up of Ms. Right (Jacinda Barrett) in the local supermarket, the growing family, the changing nature of the job and Jack's brushes with terror and death are recounted in flashbacks. 

The blaze that has Jack trapped is impressive enough, but the flashbacks take away any sense of urgency about his fate. And the smoothed-over frictions in the family and the firehouse suck most of the drama out of this.

Director Jay Russell is the son of a firefighter and a specialist in sentiment ("My Dog Skip" and "Tuck Everlasting" were his). He has a reverence for the subject that pretty much precludes the film showing us anything new, from the corner hang-out Irish bar to the growing, boisterous family. Brave men are hurt, brave men die, and then we go to their funerals. 

The technical stuff, procedures followed, the pecking order on the trucks and at the fires, seem spot on. But there is little here to tell us why any of these guys do what they do, "go into burning buildings when everybody else is running out." Phoenix has a scene or two suggesting that he gets a rush from "helping people," but nothing more.

"Ladder 49" is, as its Disney lineage suggests, a fire-fighting movie that's family friendly. Treated as a movie you can take your kids to, its sense of routine heroism, the reassuring continuity of people who show up for work and save us when we need saving, is its greatest asset.

Long before the ideas for Pollo Tropical and Boston Market were ever conceived, Peruvians, as well as many South Americans, turned to rotisserie chicken, or pollo a la brasa, for inexpensive fast food. In Peru, a polleria (rotisserie chicken restaurant) is the equivalent of what a pizzeria would be in New York City. 

There are no chains or franchises, and each independently owned and operated polleria competes against the other to see which has the moistest, most flavorful chicken, the crunchiest "papitas" (French fries), and the best dipping sauces. With the influx of Peruvian immigrants to Miami, this tradition has been transferred to this side of the equator and has enjoyed great success among the Peruvian diaspora. Colombians, Argentineans and Uruguayans soon followed suit, and now you can spot many different South American pollerias all over the city like El Pollon and Zuper Pollo.

One such polleria is El Tambo Grill, which opened about two years ago.  After only a couple of years, this restaurant has been a major success in the Peruvian community, and one seldom finds the restaurant empty. The secret to its success is the cook, known to regulars as Diego, who has a carefully guarded recipe and technique for marinating and cooking the chicken, as well as an unwavering dedication to quality.

Located at 7118 S.W. 117th Ave., the restaurant itself is humbly decorated, with modest cream-colored walls adorned with various photographs of Peru's cities and monuments, as well as a large Peruvian flag.  The tables are equally simple - each naked with paper napkin dispenser and a plastic vase containing silk flowers. Overhead, two televisions air Spanish-language soap operas, music videos or soccer games.  During an important soccer match, the game is projected onto a large screen so that everyone can easily view it. It is during these nights (especially during Peruvian matches) that the restaurant is packed and has an energetic ambiance, reminiscent of a televised American football game at a Sports Bar, but with more fervor.

You order at the counter, where there are green laminated menus in English and Spanish, give your name, and take a seat until your order is ready. The basic order is rotisserie chicken, French fries and salad. This comes with the two classic accompanying sauces, huancaina and huacatay. 

The former is a creamy, slightly spicy, cheesy sauce with a pale yellow color from aji chilies. The latter is much spicier and is made from vinegar, rocoto chilies and the Peruvian herb huacatay, which is a relative of mint. 

A whole chicken, French fries and salad, or rice and beans with two sauces costs $11.00 and can easily feed four people.  However, the chicken is not the only hit on the menu. The second most popular dish there is the arroz chaufa, a type of fried rice that was brought over to Peru by Chinese immigrants and is now considered part of the national cuisine. 

This, along with a quarter of a chicken and a soda is $5.25.  Recently added to the menu were Lomo Saltado, another Peruvian-Chinese dish of stir fried strips of meat and vegetables topped with French fries and served with rice ($9.00), and Anticuchos, the quintessential Peruvian street food, which basically consists of skewered chunks of grilled, marinated beef heart ($6.75). As unappealing as this may sound, even the most squeamish diners, upon trying it, have no regrets. Not to be missed is the house-made Chicha Morada, a traditional punch made by steeping purple corn and fruit in boiling water, along with spices and sugar, and reserving the liquid. The result is a refreshing beverage that is perfect alongside any dish.

While El Tambo Grill excels in their chicken and other main dishes, they are weak in their desserts, which are brought in from an outside source. They mainly consist of pastries filled with manjar blanco (dulce de leche), a type of milk sweet similar to caramel. 

The picarones, however, are made to order and are phenomenal. These typical Afro-Peruvian pumpkin donuts are deep fried and then drizzled with a clove-scented brown sugar syrup. Each bite is simply heavenly. So, next time you think about having chicken at a franchise, consider the alternative and be prepared to be ultimately satisfied.
