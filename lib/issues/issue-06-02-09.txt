Headline: Racism in U.S. impedes teaching of black history
Author: Daniel Cordova / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In a "60 Minutes" interview this past December, actor Morgan Freeman, declared that the concept of Black History Month is 'ridiculous'. "You're going to regulate my history to only a month?" Freeman said, "I don't want a Black History Month.  Black history is American history."

Whether or not you agree with Freeman, he boldly confronts an issue that many Americans deny still exists. Racism. Sadly, racism is an ugly characteristic that has been woven into American culture over centuries. Many steps are being taken to purge this blemish from our society but we have yet to be successful since it is so deeply engrained.  

Black History Month originated from Negro History Week, which was established by Dr. Carter G. Woodson in 1926. The month of February was chosen because the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglas both fall in this month. Dr. Woodson hoped that when black history was fully integrated with American history, the week could be done away with.  

Large strides for the civil rights of black Americans have been made since 1926, so is it time to do away with Black History Month? The answer is a disappointing no.  The truth is that black history has yet to be incorporated into the American history that is taught in our schools.

Surprisingly, yet refreshing, Native American history is now being extensively covered in most of the nation's school curriculum, and rightly so. Most grade school students would be able to tell you about the Seminoles, Iroquois, Apaches, Cherokees and many more. 

They could tell you the basics of their culture, how they lived, the struggles they faced, the food they ate, the sports they played, who the influential people were, etc.

Why is this not the case with black history? Textbooks come out with new editions every year, a fact college students know all too well. Why isn't more black history injected into these new editions? The answer is racism.  

Whether you're conscious of it or not, racism still exists in our schools, our government, our neighborhoods, our churches and everywhere else. Racism is not just slandering and acting hostile toward another race, it can manifest itself in many ways. Today, neglect and ignorance are the two top forms of racism in our society. What makes this difficult is that when racism manifests itself in these forms, a person doesn't even realize that they are being racist.

What can we do to combat racism? Education is the only remedy. This answer is a bit of a paradox itself. Our schools are guilty of discriminating, yet they hold the keys to the fight against discrimination. Therefore, time must play a role also. Time will allow education to catch up to include more black history.  

The Civil Rights Movement was not that long ago, relatively speaking. Many of our parents experienced this transitional period of American History first hand. Forty years is not enough time to erase 400 years of injustice. We need to continue to fight racism through education so that one day we won't need a separate month for black history,  just as we no longer have separate schools, bathrooms and drinking fountains.  

Freeman is absolutely correct in saying black history deserves more attention than just one month. Unfortunately, until black history is seen as American history by society and until the education system catches up from the 400 years of discrimination, Black History Month is necessary.

Subheadline: Death penalty ineffective
Author: Paul Benavides / Freshman / Psychology Major
&nbsp;
In response to Christine Liriano's opinion piece "Review of death penalty necessary in Florida" (Jan.30, 2006), the author seems to contradict herself in stating that "justice served on a guilty inmate gives us a feeling of relief," yet Liriano goes on to say that "it is impossible to really know if an inmate is innocent." 

Where does this relief come from? Furthermore, does capital punishment exclusively provide us this relief?

If we were serious about the question, then we would take into consideration the conclusions of criminologists who state, and have stated since the early 20th century, that the death penalty has no demonstrable deterrence. 

In other words, in states that exercise the punishment it has not worked to lower homicide rates. Therefore, I believe that the world wouldn't flinch if the death penalty were abolished tomorrow.

The real feeling of relief would come from taking responsibility, socially and politically, in encouraging constructive methods of crime prevention. 

Should we wait on California so we can make up our own minds on how to reduce crime?

If Liriano is correct in assuming that it is impossible to really know the guilt of an inmate, and we know that several men have been wrongfully convicted of murder and placed in Death Row, then is there really time to study and make improvements on executions when a wrongfully convicted man's life might hang in the balance?

Subheadline: Article too dismisive of  benefits of passive protest
Author: Pedro Pavon / FIU Alumni
&nbsp;
I was very disappointed in reading this article ["Campus rally incites anger" (Feb. 2, 2006)]. Clearly the writer was more interested in showing us how good he is at collecting vocabulary words than describing, or even criticizing, the events at hand.

The article was difficult to follow and poorly written.

With all of that being said, the author continually expressed his annoyance with "protestors in my face" and the expansion of the First Amendment. Maybe the author would care to show us how helpful private, behind closed doors, silent protests would be in raising an issue?  I don't think the author could because clearly he misses the point.

Subheadline: Editorial lacked factual foundation
Author: Fernando Marmolejos/ Sophomore / Environmental Science Major
&nbsp;
First of all, as a newspaper that tries to encourage opinions you should first look over and article and make sure at least the essence of the opinion is correct. In response to the editorial, "Methods used at rally accomplish little" (Feb 6), I will have to admit that I agree that it was not right method of approaching a group of college students and that Jed Smock's approach was taken in a negative way, but at least get the basics straight. 

If you contacted FIRE, who is 100 percent behind complete freedom of speech, especially in religious issues, then you should have done more homework and looked for more background information on this matter. 

Another thing that shocked me was that the date was wrong - It was actualy Jan 31. But of course no one ever checks such things when its just an editorial. Furthermore, there are no quotes and no questions, just vague things that were said by the Campus Ministry USA. And really, was this article about the First Amendment or were you just looking to making it sound fancy by talking about it?

Because from the way it was discussed, it seems as if the first Amendment is something that one just has and takes for granted.

What should be done is be sent to a country where there is no such thing as freedom and one has to stay completely silent about matters that are of great magnitude not something that offends people for hearing it. Let's be honest with ourselves, if we don't want to hear about how safe our planet is from aliens, we don't listen. 

But if somebody is saying something that is offensive then we'll listen and try to change their minds. If we are to do that then our lives are going to be miserable just thinking of what someone is saying everywhere that really is not for us unless we want to hear it. 

As a lesson learned from this rally I think we need to stay away from those things that will offend us and enjoy those that don't, instead of having to write a half page of garbage that at the end shows me why I never pick up the "Beacon" to read in the first place.

Bush's spending plan protested by both Democrats and Republicans

President George W. Bush sent Congress a 2007 spending plan that farmers, teachers and doctors are protesting. 

The negative reaction from Democrats was expected, however many Republicans expressed their concern with the $2.77 trillion spending blueprint. 

Comments such as "disappointed and even surprised" came from Sen. Olympia Snow (R) from Maine, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R) from Pennsylvania who called the budget cuts "scandalous." 

The spending budget begins Oct. 1 and includes, for the next five years, savings of $36 billion in Medicare, $5 billion in farm subsidy programs, $4.9 billion in Medicaid support for poor children's health care and $16.7 billion in additional payments. 

The budget would provide an increase in military and homeland security spending while cutting one-sixth of discretionary spending.

Headline: 'P. Hami' works hard behind SGA desk
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Anyone who has passed by the Student Government Association offices about a student concern, an interview, an appointment or even for a class project, has probably seen or spoken to Phillip Hamilton, or P. Hami, as he is popularly known as. Hamilton, 22, a junior majoring in public administration, is probably one of the most recognizable faces of campus life, being actively involved on campus and working for the SGA office.

"Phillip has been a staple of SGA in the last four years," said Representative At-Large Alfonso Leon. "He, more than anything, makes excellence a habit."

Hamilton was promoted to the position of senior secretary clerk for the SGA office in November but has been working with the SGA since 2002. Graduating from Blanche Ely High School in Pompano Beach in 2002, Hamilton joined FIU in the fall of 2002.  

"I came to FIU wanting to get involved," said Hamilton. "I was the president of my high school council and so I really wanted to be involved with the student government here at FIU."

Hamilton came to FIU in an internship program and was an SGA intern for a year during which he was named "Intern of the Year." 

Leon, who has also been named SGA's "Intern of the Year," looks up to Hamilton. 

"When I became an intern, I tried to be more like Phillip. He treats everyday like his first day on the job in the sense that he gets everything done on time and on schedule," Leon said.

When asked about his typical day at the SGA office, Hamilton said there weren't any.

"There's always something new. I'm here by 9:30 a.m. and usually leave around 7 or 8 p.m.," he said. "My job includes simple things like answering phones as well as more complex matters such as planning trips for council members or ordering new computers for the administration."

"P. Hami has to be the most reliable person I've met in my life," said Christine Denton, vice president of the SGA. "Not only is he a hard worker but a genuine true friend. He's also the smartest man I know."

With the SGA elections a month and a half away, Hamilton is getting busier by the day, with his workload being concentrated on getting election forms, banners and proof reading documents and letters, among other things. Apart from SGA, Hamilton has also been active with other areas of Campus Life, serving as vice president of Panther Rage in 2003-2004 and as housing representative to the SGA two years ago. 

Currently, he is actively involved with Alpha Kappa Phi (the Business fraternity), the Student Alumni Association and serves as the philanthropy chairman for his fraternity Pi Kappa Phi.

Headline: World-traveling librarian takes on double responsibility
Author: Elizabeth Caram / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Antonie Downs told her parents she was moving to Europe to work for the United States Army as a civilian, they shrugged.

"They knew it was typical of me," said Downs, the interim director of both FIU libraries. 

After finishing her Master's in library school at the University of Wisconsin, Philadelphia-born Downs packed her bags and went off to what was then the Czechoslovakian border and worked as a librarian on the military post.

"The Army was my boss," she said. 

She also spent a few years as a civilian in the Netherlands and in Munich. 

Her time in Munich coincided with the 1972 Olympic Games, which she said was interesting.

She began her time at FIU 29 years ago as assistant director at the Biscayne Bay Campus, where she had total control over the library's administrative planning, schedule planning and budgeting; among many other responsibilities. 

She has now doubled her load, having two libraries under her control. 

She earned the temporary position in the University Park campus in October after the former director retired. 

"Tony Downs is FIU," said Vice Provost Raul Moncarz. "She believes strongly in FIU and its mission. She represents what FIU is all about: friendship and service to faculty, students and the rest of the FIU community."

Although she happily took on the responsibilities which come along with being a director, she said it is a temporary position for her.

"I've been here a long time," she said from her bright, airy office in the Green Library. "I think [FIU libraries] need fresh blood."

There is an active search going on to find that blood and it has proven to be a difficult feat. 

FIU has even hired a search firm to aid in the hunt for a permanent director of both libraries.

The candidate must be highly qualified and come from an associate level position at a large university or a public research library.

"It's very difficult to find someone [like that who is looking for a change,]" Downs said. 

Downs is optimistic that the position will be filled by the Fall semester.

When Downs traveled across Europe, it was not the first time she had packed her suitcase and went abroad. 

During her undergraduate academic career at Ohio Wesleyan Methodist, she completed her junior year in Colombia. 

Her stay in Colombia helped Downs learm the Spanish language which she now speaks at a basic level.

A world traveler and an avid reader, it is not hard to see how she ended up spending so much of her time in librariesl. 

"I sort of eased my way into it," she said of her career path.

When she was in college, the New York Times was running five to six ads for librarians. "There was a tremendous demand," Downs said.

After reading those ads and hearing from an Army recruiter on campus, she knew it was time for a change and that change was in Europe. 

Her love of traveling has not died down a bit. 

Downs plans to visit Australia with her husband, a retired police officer whom she is celebrating a 20th anniversary with this month. 

Her 'child' is a rescued greyhound named Kiowa Burma, who the Downs refers to simply as "Burma."

Their Miami Shores home boasts a vegetable garden most of the year and about 100 wild orchids in the backyard.

As for her commute from Miami Shores to the University Park campus, she said it is probably the hardest part about the job. 

On her way to the University, she listens to audio books in the car to help ease the frustration of Miami traffic.

"Something to help keep my blood pressure down," Downs said.

Along with maintaining the budget and dealing with operation control, Downs also keeps everything coordinated. 

She makes sure the libraries are keeping up with new technology and looks for new positions to assist in the transition from print to electronically recorded information.

Headline: Professor helps injured news anchor, cameraman
Author: C. Joel Marino / Content Editor
&nbsp;
Gerard "Jerry" Hogan, a clinical assistant professor in the School of Nursing's anesthesiology program currently serving as an Air Force Reserve Major in the Iraqi war, thought the wounded patient he was called to assist Jan. 29 would be just another of the low profile cases he has dealt with in the past.

It was upon arriving in Iraq from his base in Germany that he found out the patient was none other than Bob Woodruff, one of two new anchors replacing the late Peter Jennings for ABC's "World News Tonight," and his cameraman, David Vogt. 

Both men had sustained critical head injuries after an explosive device detonated near their vehicle as they traveled through the outskirts of Baghdad.

"We didn't find out about the news crew members until we arrived in Iraq," Hogan said via an e-mail interview with The Beacon "First we were told that there would be media on board, but they initially didn't tell us they were patients. We found out shortly thereafter and were able to prepare for them with no loss of time due to the miscommunication."

As medical crew director for the 791st Expeditionary Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, Hogan was in charge of assisting the medical transport team that cared for the news crew aboard the C-17 flight from the Balad air base to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. This crew consisted of a nurse, a physician and a respiratory technician.

"We are trained to take charge and prepare as expeditiously as possible to accommodate the additional patients.  The crew that I work with did that with great expertise," Hogan said. "I am glad to say that [Woodruff and Vogt] tolerated the flight well and were moved on to the medical center for further care."

This is the second time in three years that Hogan has been activated in support of Operations Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Iraqi Freedom. 

According to Hogan, experiences like the rescue of Woodruff and many injured soldiers during this time of service have taught him life lessons he'll never forget.

"It is an awesome responsibility and privilege to care for our wounded warriors as they are moved to more definitive care," Hogan said. "Spending as much time as I do with such young soldiers, marines, airmen and sailors with life changing injuries makes you appreciate what you have."

However, despite his love for the job he is doing, Hogan, who has been a part of the Air Force Reserve for nearly 16 years, is still looking forward to his homecoming this April.

"Deployments are hard on your job and family. I am looking forward to getting back to work at FIU and hanging up my flight suit for a while," he said.

Upon returning to South Florida, Hogan stated that his priorities will be to "spend time with my family, watch my youngest graduate from high school and help him move to college in the fall."

There are also a few other things he misses about his home.

"It is about 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-5C) here and snowing as we speak. I miss the sunshine."

As Woodruff and Vogt recover from their wounds in the U.S. hospital they have recently been transferred to, Hogan will remain stationed in the German Ramstein Air Base and wait for the next order that will take him and his medical team back to Iraq.

"[This] is a difficult but certainly worthwhile job. I have no regrets for the time that I have spent in the United States Air Force," Hogan said.

Headline: Red carpet corsets become mainstream
Author: Atheena Johnson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Whether you are dressing up for the red carpet or a fashionable night out at the movies, you can always "Go Grammy Style!" 

One of the boldest fashion statements this season is the corset. It is intimate and daring, yet not too risqué. Depending on how you complement it, you can get a different look every time. 

The secret lies within the accessories. By wearing a corset with a calve length, silk skirt you can accomplish a sophisticated look.  The corset is an eye-catching piece and the silk skirt will offer a softer touch to the outfit. Silk is the best material for a touch of class. 

Make sure that the skirt is not above the knee and does not reach the ankles. To further enhance the corset and silk skirt, a small fur overthrow can be added to accomplish a modern look.

As with any outfit, the right shoes are essential. Do not make the mistake of thinking that black shoes match with everything. The best thing to do is find a color shoe that naturally compliments the corset. 

When dressing the corset down, a bad-girl look is always a good option. By accompanying the corset with a short jean skirt, you will accentuate your waist and legs. However, if you are self-conscious of your legs, a knee length skirt should do the trick. 

You do not want to wear something you are not comfortable in. Try to find a jean skirt that has a light sandstone fade. The darker the sandstone, the cheaper the skirt looks.  

The key to this outfit is the lace up sandal. The lacing of the sandals incorporates the lacing of the corset and is a perfect compliment.  It may take a while to find the perfect shoes but be patient, the final product will be worth it.  

A trendy over the shoulder bag and a nice pair of shades are also excellent touches. Along with the right shoes and purse, jewelry is equally as important of a factor as any fashion statement.  When dressing the corset up, simple jewelry is best.  A crystal and diamond style set of earrings and necklace will make the outfit look classic and have people turning their heads. 

The jewelry for the dressed down corset can make a bolder statement. A big, brown beaded necklace with matching earrings will make this outfit look amazing. There are always different ways to put a taste of your own style into any outfit.  

Find a unique statement that represents you and run with it, just make sure your comfortable and that it works for you.

Headline: Mellowdrone's sound proves outside the Box
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Mellowdrone, an eclectic rock group from Los Angeles, manages to take their listeners on a psychedelic rollercoaster with their debut album Box that hits stores March 7. 

Catchy tunes are contained on the disc and almost every song delves into unpredictable territory, creating varied structures and captivating melodies. 

Consisting of singer/guitarist Jonathan Bates, drummer Brian Borg, guitarist Tony Dematteo and bass/keyboardist Cami Gutierrez, Mellowdrone delivers a powerful album that will play in your iPod or CD player for a long time. 

Ranging from space-pop to new wave, Box's 13 tracks mix together to make a diverse and experimental disc. The opening track "Come On Try a Little Bit" introduces a spacey vibe accentuated by a thumping bass line and screeching guitars. 

With such a seductive croon, Bates pulls listeners into a world filled with captivating choruses and varied instrumentation. 

As the drumming of the opening track fades, the next song "Oh My" hits hard with its thunderous introduction, reminiscent of alternative rock group The Killers. The song progresses into its tongue-in-cheek chorus Oh my, what a wonderful day and follows with a sudden shift into a mellower sound. 

"Four Leaf Clover" turns down the initial intensity of the previous track and provides a trippy atmosphere where Gutierrez's keyboard skills shine. 

When the chorus arrives, the memorable background vocals will have you humming along. 

Mellowdrone's first single "Fashionably Uninvited" begins with a haunting melody from Gutierrez and develops into a beautiful crescendo that seamlessly flows into a calming harmony. 

Box becomes more upbeat with "Beautiful Day," a song showing influences from alternative rock band The Postal Service. Nevertheless, Bates's voice stops all comparisons and gives the song its own identity. 

In addition, Bates lets his wry humor show in the song's lyrics as he sings Take care and don't upset the crowd.

The following song "F*ck It Man" slows the disc down, but the snappy chorus is perfect for singing along to . Although the song has a happy melody, dark lyrics flood the song while drummer Borg supports the acoustic guitar sounds.

The CD begins to falter with track 7. "Whatever the Deal" sounds like a rip-off of U2. Although it's not a bad song, it lacks any real originality. 

"Madison" continues the album's downward spiral by sounding too much like the previous songs. The drumming is simplistic and the song follows a redundant structure that makes for a boring listen. 

Track 9, "And Repeat," is the weakest track on the disc and just drags on - Bates's drowsy voice adds to the song's dullness. 

Luckily, the album redeems itself with the final four tracks. "Orange Marmalade" is a relaxing tune consisting of a sturdy bass line underlying Gutierrez's skilled keyboarding. 

In this song, Bates recovers his fantastic range and shows off accordingly. 

Mellowdrone impresses with "Amazing," an aptly named song that overlays vocals and forms a bouncy harmony interlaced with spectacular vocal demonstration.

While "Bone Marrow" resembles the past song, the band continues its aural assault by impeccably arranging instruments and vocal talents to create an excellent blending of addictive melodies. 

"Limb to Limb" ends Box with some of the most experimental sounds ever - Gutierrez's spacey harmonics polish the album's finish as Bates repeats "From limb to limb …"

Overall, Mellowdrone's Box is a solid album worthy of your rock collection. With its addictive melodies, it's hard not to want this CD. Although the album stumbles around the middle, it redeems itself and provides a unique sound that sticks around in your head.

Subheadline: Students find benefits in becoming a resident assistant
Author: Nicole Acosta / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Freshman Christopher Mark Thomas decided he wanted to be a resident assistant last semester when an RA helped him get in contact with his mother, who was staying at a hotel nearby. Thomas, who had just moved from Trinidad, tried to call her from the front desk of Panther Hall but was told he couldn't. The RA told Thomas he could use the phone in his room.	   Thomas soon realized that as a RA you get to help people in times of need. 

According to Assistant Director of Residential Life Ron Thompson, Thomas was one out of about 100 applicants applying for a RA position for the 2006-2007 school year. 

That total surpasses last year's number of applicants. 

"Up until last year, we compared those numbers because a high applicant rate does not always equal better RAs," Thompson said. "There were more hirable applicants last year than any other year. A lot of it really depends on who they are, why they're applying and what their skill sets are."

Thompson said that the high applicant rate may be due to new marketing techniques. Aside from advertising on the Internet and around campus, as in previous years, ads were also placed in back-to-back issues of The Beacon at the beginning of the Spring semester. 

At this time, Thompson does not know how many RA positions are available because they are currently in the process of re-hiring RAs for next year as well. 

Although the total is unknown, Thompson said that 24 positions would be available for Lakeview Housing, which is scheduled to open by Fall 2006. About 15 RA information sessions have already been held at University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus. 

According to Thompson, students that applied needed to attend an information session in order to revieve and application.

"The basic rationale for information sessions is for you to be armed with information before applying," Thompson said.

At this point, all of the candidates for RA positions have been chosen. They are now in the middle of a three-week workshop called "RA classes," which meet once a week. There, the topics of ethics, diversity and resident life philosophies are covered.

After the RA classes, candidates will be interviewed by the resident life coordinator, a graduate assistant and a RA picked at random. Then, all 16 professional staff members will meet and decide which candidates will become RAs. 

Thompson believes the staff's main goal is to find the best combination of RAs.

"We want to have a great team in each area," he said. "We're always looking at 'How would this group work together?' There has to be a healthy group dynamic."

Thompson also said that he is looking for "someone who understands what the post is about. Someone who has sound interpersonal skills, high awareness of self and someone who is ready for the challenge."

Junior and RA for Everglades Hall, Khela Stanley, agreed that being an RA is definitely a challenge.

"It matures you because you have to handle a lot of responsibility. Some days, you just learn as you go. It's not for everybody," Stanley said. "You have to realize the amount of work you're going to be taking on."

There are many benefits to being a RA aside from having a salary and a complimentary room.

"You get the opportunity to get leadership skills. You get a chance to build a network within FIU. You also get a chance to develop your social skills and time management skills," Stanley said. 

Building a network within FIU is one of the reasons why the RA position appealed to freshman Lillian Marquez. 

"Networking is always good. It's good for leadership experience," Marquez said.

Thomas wants to be a RA because he wants to learn about different people and their cultures.

"As a RA, you get to know everyone better," he said. "It's a fulfilling experience."

Headline: Baseball sweeps Golden Knights
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Mother Nature forced the cancellation of the first game in the baseball team's series against Central Florida. However, despite having to start the makeup game at 11 a.m. the next day, the Golden Panthers made the most of the day off and completed a double-header sweep Feb. 5 at University Park Stadium.

"It's really hard to win a double header," head coach Danny Price said. "I hate double headers, because it equalizes both team's opportunity to win, [but] I felt really good about us playing this week."

FIU, swept at the hands of Miami to open up the season, evens its season record at 2-2 and beats UCF for the first time since 2002. The Golden Knights start their 2006 campaign 0-2.

The Golden Panthers lead the all-time series against UCF 47-43.

The Golden Panthers will travel to Los Angeles to face Southern California, who was ranked No. 18 in the preseason but was swept in its opening series. The three-game series begins Feb. 10 with the first pitch at 9 p.m. (EST).

"I think this is a great opportunity for us," Price said. "Southern Cal is traditionally rich in baseball and we've already played two of the richest universities when it comes to college baseball [Miami and Central Florida]."



FIU 4, UCF 3



Despite the 11 a.m. start, the Golden Panthers were wide awake as they tagged UCF starting pitcher Tim Bascom - preseason Conference USA Pitcher-of-the Year and All-American - for four runs and their first win of the season.

The match was a legitimate pitcher's duel with FIU starter Walker Whitley, as both pitchers did not allow a run until the bottom of the fourth inning, when FIU struck first.

Third baseman Nick Cadena led off the fourth with a single. Following a sacrifice bunt and a groundout, the senior was sitting on third base with two outs and freshman Alex Alfonso at the plate. FIU attempted a suicide squeeze as Alfonso showed he was going to bunt and Cadena began running toward home. However, Bascom's pitch was high and inside, not allowing Alfonso to make contact. Cadena continued charging home, slid head first and was called safe at the plate, narrowly avoiding UCF catcher Ryan Bono's tag.

FIU rallied again in the fifth inning, scoring three runs - one off a Cadena bases loaded, RBI single, a wild pitch that allowed senior Michael Lopez to score and a James McOwen RBI walk. The inning ended with FIU leaving the bases loaded.

Bascom finished the day allowing three runs (one unearned) on two hits, three walks and two strikeouts in four and one-third innings of work for the Golden Knights.

Whitley, who was tagged by Miami for seven runs, pitched seven shutout innings, allowed two hits, walked three batters and struck out eight.

UCF did not go down without putting up a fight.

In the eighth inning, UCF's Kiko Vazquez hit a two-run homerun over the left-centerfield wall off FIU closer Frank Gonzalez.

In the ninth, UCF threatened again. After scoring one run, the Golden Knights had the bases loaded with one out. Bono hit a fly ball to shallow right field and it was caught by junior Chris Dunn, who immediately fired a throw home to prevent the tying run from tagging up. 

Gonzalez finally got out of the jam with more help from Dunn, who raced to foul territory to snag a fly ball as he hit and flipped over the fence of the UCF bullpen.

 "The first catch was probably the harder of the two," Dunn said. "But the second one, it was pretty windy [and] I thought I was gonna land about fifteen feet from the foul line. The wind just took the ball and I just tried to stay with it. 

"I didn't really feel like I was getting close to the fence. Then, right at the last second, I hit the fence."

Price added, "[Dunn] was a football player in high school, so I think that's where the football mentality comes out in his play sometimes."



FIU 13, UCF 3



After narrowly edging out UCF in the first game, the Golden Panthers took the momentum from Dunn's circus catch and put on an offensive display.

FIU's 10-run victory over UCF was not something both teams are used to. The three previous meetings between the teams have been decided by one run. 

Led by catcher Luis Bautista and second baseman Yosvel Barroso, FIU recorded 15 hits in the game.

"Every time [your team] gets hits it's a confidence booster to get up [to the mound]," said Chris Siebenaler, FIU's starting pitcher for game two.

Bautista went 3-for-4 with a homerun, a double and four RBI. Barroso went three-for-three with an RBI. Outfielders Bryan Pullin and James McOwen added two hits each.

Despite the final score, it was UCF who got on the board first off a Bono homerun in the first inning, which Price argued went foul as the ball traveled over the foul pole. 

"Coach Price went out and argued it," Siebenaler said. "It could have [gone] either way, but you gotta shake it off and go to the next batter."

FIU starter Chris Siebenaler settled down after that, finishing the day allowing three runs (two earned) on seven hits, walking three and striking out three batters. 

"I'm a borderline perfectionist, so I expected more from myself," Siebenaler said. 

FIU tied the game off Bautista's solo shot in the second inning and added three runs in the third to take the lead for good.

FIU scored in every inning except for the first and eighth.

"I saw the intensity all along and I saw the intensity for 18 innings," Price said.

For the second night in a row the Golden Panthers let a win slip through their fingers on their home floor. 

FIU (5-15, 2-6), attempting to get out of the cellar in the Sun Belt East Division, fell once again at home, repeating the feat of getting beaten while dominating for most of the contest, 66-64 to visiting Middle Tennessee (11-9, 4-4). 

Following the loss, head coach Sergio Rouco was again dumbfounded by his team's output late in the contest.

"We just can't get guys to make plays at the end of games,"  Rouco said. "We haven't put a whole game together this season where we make enough plays to win."

The Blue Raiders, though struggling to shoot well, trailed by as much as 10 points in the first half and nine with 11:16 to play, but managed to fight their way back through solid defense and made free throws.

Led by three scorers in double figures, Middle Tennessee, who had struggled in the first half to both keep FIU from scoring and score themselves, made wise adjustments through head coach Kermit Davis, who in turn picked up his 200th career win. 

"They made plays and we didn't," Rouco said. "It was that simple."

Adam Vogelsberg and Tim Blue, who both fouled out late in the game, led the Blue Raiders with 12 points apiece, and guard Calvin O'Neil added 11 in the win and combined for 13-of-17 from the free throw line. 

Senior forward Ivan Almonte and junior guard Johwen Villegas once again led the way for the hosts with 16 and 14 points respectively. 

Almonte, who was attempting to break his own record of double-doubles in a season at 13, came two rebounds short. 

The story however was the difference in halves by the Golden Panthers.

After shooting 46 percent in the opening frame and leading by four, 40-36, FIU managed to convert just six field goals in the second half and allowed the Blue Raiders to go on a 13-0 over a 7:54 stretch. 

The 13-0 run not only allowed Middle Tennessee back into the game, but gave them a 60-56 lead with 3:22 to play; a lead they would never give back. 

Although the Golden Panthers were much improved from the free throw line, shooting a solid 80 percent by converting 21-of-26 attempts, it would once again prove to be their kryptonite. 

Villegas pulled the home side within one, 62-61, with 2:30 to play after converting one of his four three point makes. 

Almonte, who shot 7-of-10 from the charity stripe for the night, got his chance to give the struggling Golden Panthers some life and promises of a win with a one-and-one free throw attempt with just over two minutes to play. 

He missed the first attempt at the one-and-one and FIU never got another chance. 

Middle Tennessee connected four times, much like Western Kentucky had just three nights before, from the free throw line and extended their lead to an insurmountable five points with 21 seconds to play. 

Almonte would nail a three-point attempt too-little-too-late as time expired to bring the scoreboard to it's final 66-64 standing and ended a three game home stand having lost the final two. 

Troubled travels are expected for the Golden Panthers as they head on a tour of Arkansas over the weekend, Feb. 9 and 11, looking to avenge early January home losses to both Arkansas-Little Rock (55-53) and Arkansas St. (81-71). 

FIU has struggled on the road this season having won just one of 10 so far.
