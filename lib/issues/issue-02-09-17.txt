Headline: Messy "Ballistic" misses mark
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
Okay, I'm a big action fan myself and there's nothing wrong with a lot of car chases and explosions, but even I know that neither of them will work without a good plot. A good plot is just one of many things that "Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever" lacks. "Ballistic" is the first American film by Thai director Wych Kaosayananda; I have no idea how to pronounce it, I'm still trying to get the hang of M. Night Shyamalan. Although he is credited with "Fah," a hit film in his home country, he doesn't appear to know how to entertain audiences on this side of the globe. This movie is so dull, you'll get a better deal for your money if you pay to watch grass grow. The plot doesn't evolve and finishes too quickly, so it literally goes nowhere fast.

The story actually starts off rather well. The son of a high ranking agent is kidnapped by a renegade spy named Sever (Lucy Liu). This scene has one or two well-timed explosions that take you by surprise, making it one of the few decent scenes in the whole flick. Desperate to have his son back, the boy's father, Robert Gant (Gregg Henry) secretly arranges for the help of FBI agent Jeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas), who they believe is the best man for the job, despite his obvious instability. Ecks' boss comes to him with a proposition. He shows him proof that his wife, who he thought was killed by a car bomb seven years ago, is alive. If he helps them find Sever, he would give more information. How could he refuse? He quickly gets his act together and joins the hunt. 

Ecks tracks her down, but realizes that although finding her was easy, capturing her is a whole different ballgame. This leads to a major shoot off that isn't too bad except it doesn't last long enough, a pointless car chase that wasn't worth the gas money and explosions so weak, they should be registered as campfires. There was even a hand-to-hand combat fight between Ecks and Sever (in which she kicked his butt) that was so poorly done, you'd think their choreographer was half-asleep.

Along the way, he learns a few interesting things about his prey. It turns out she used to work with Gant until her daughter was killed in an attack he authorized, despite his knowledge of her presence. At first, Ecks believes she's out for revenge, but soon finds out that there's more to it than he realizes. He also learns that Sever knows where his wife is, which makes him more determined than ever to catch her. He eventually realizes that Gant's underlying intentions behind getting his son back are somewhat less than noble, and they quickly become allies. 

I find it hard to believe that there was even an ounce of intelligent thought put into this film's production. There were too many much-needed elements missing, such as a plot, dialog, and at least a half-hour to an hour of extra time. 

With the exception of one explosion and maybe two fight scenes, there is nothing in this movie worth watching. I did enjoy the fight scene between Lucy Liu and Ray Park. Still, I feel sorry for him. This was his first movie where he had more than three lines. I wouldn't recommend he do anymore movies with Wych though, unless he gets his act together. Of course, if any of his future projects are as lame as this one, he may never direct in this country again.

Headline: Stevens continues to build Volleyball program
Author: Daisy Fernandez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coach Dulcie "Cookie" Stevens is prepared to take on her fourth season at FIU. This Brooklyn-born volleyball expert plans to surpass last year's success. She will push the team to go beyond their championship in the 2001 Sunbelt Conference.  

Long before Stevens became a coach at FIU, she learned to play volleyball with her sixth-grade P.E. teacher. She later attended Monsignor Edward Pace High School in Hialeah. Her tall stature (Stevens is 6'0") allowed her to play middle blocker and hitter. Her accomplishments in these positions raised her to the college level. She began at Miami-Dade Community College and scaled to San Diego State University, where she continued to shine athletically.

Volleyball became more than a passion for Stevens: it was a helpful teacher. In the gym, she learned unique strategies that she could apply to everyday life. "Being in a team has taught me life lessons, like conflict resolution and problem solving techniques," Stevens said.

The demands of the court encouraged her to excel in academics as well. She graduated from FIU in 1981 with a Bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies. By 1989 she moved to earn a Master's in Physical Education from Nova Southeastern University.

Her years playing volleyball made her a master of the sport. In 1979 her 
role changed from most valuable player to head coach. She coached for almost two decades at Miami-Dade Community College before transferring to Westminster Christian School. Four years ago, she landed at FIU to rescue women's volleyball.

It took Stevens only three years to transform the FIU team. Last season they came out of their underdog status to become real winners. Her proudest moment in volleyball is exactly this event. Guiding the team to the Sunbelt Conference Championship in 2001 was an incredible feat for Stevens. As a coach, she has also won a number of honors. One hangs in her office the: NCAA Division I South Region Coach of the Year Award. 

Outside her coaching career, Stevens enjoys taking care of her family. 

Stevens has been married for the last 19 years to photographer Pete Stevens. 

Her proudest, most rewarding achievement in life has been being a mother to her two teenage sons, Sam and Kyle. 

With her husband, she has successfully raised this pair of athletic boys. 
On her free time, she likes to hang out with her sons and play tennis. Sam, the oldest of the two, will attend Ohio State University to play volleyball. According to Stevens, "[Her sons] have grown up in the gym and learned the game well." 

It is no wonder they have the talent to be future volleyball stars.
As far as the upcoming season goes, Stevens has high expectations for her team. She would like to see the volleyball players win the Sunbelt Conference again and go a few steps further. Although they will face the challenges of a much stronger schedule and higher rank teams, Coach Stevens is determined to make it happen this fall.  

She believes the team has outstanding potential on its own and the players have positive chemistry, great work ethic, and competitiveness. 
These qualities, combined with her intense practice routines, should leave the volleyball team limitless.    

Stevens could have made millions jealous when she admitted, "I love my job. I couldn't be any happier. I have it made." 

For her, being a part of the FIU athletics program, which is headed up by Athletic Director Rick Mello, has been a blessing. 
She feels well supported. 

The only thing she seems to be missing is support from the student body. 
"I hope students realize how well the athletics program at FIU is doing." 
"I urge them to come support our team and other sports."

&nbsp;
Miguel Olivares, nos dejó sin avisar el 28 de agosto. Ni siquiera se despidió porque sus últimas frases estuvieron llenas de optimismo para sus preocupados padres que fueron testigos de la mala jugada que sus pulmones le hicieron. 

Hasta el final su personalidad optimista y llena de amor hacia los demás, le permitieron irse tranquilo, sin dolores ni preocupaciones y acompañado de sus dos grandes tesoros, sus incondicionales padres.

A pesar de haber convivido durante su vida con la sombra de la distrofia muscular que poco a poco acabó con sus músculos, luchó por conseguir todos sus sueños pasando por encima de su silla de ruedas y de la imposibilidad de escribir. 

Se graduó de secundaria junto a 11 compañeros en su natal Barranquilla quienes se convirtieron en sus mejores amigos. Cuando entró a estudiar periodismo llegó la posibilidad de viajar a Estados Unidos y a sus 23 años consiguió lo que mucho no logran en toda la vida, ser parte del equipo de CNN en Atlanta como practicante,  tener un diploma como periodista de FIU en Miami, y dentro de poco el de la maestría en periodismo que terminaría en diciembre, y hasta el día de su muerte ser parte del equipo de trabajo del diario Sun-Sentinel.

Su necesidad de analizar todo y de crear una opinión sobre los temas que más le interesaban como los deportes, el cine, la política, especialmente la situación en Colombia, y los derechos de los discapacitados, le llevaron a escribir artículos que iban a ser publicados en otros diarios del país en un futuro próximo. 

El mundo empezaba a  abrirse ante su mirada, la vida le estaba recompensando el sacrificio de haber dejado su país y sus amigos por venirse a buscar un mejor futuro con sus papas quienes suplieron la debilidad de sus músculos ayudándolo en todo lo que necesitó.

Queda ese sentimiento de molestia ante su partida prematura pero también de agradecimiento de parte de quienes lo conocimos pro haberlo puesto en nuestro camino. Nos  dejó enseñanzas y recuerdos que perdurarán por siempre, su ejemplo de optimismo a pesar de las dificultades mostró que sólo las ganas de alcanzar un sueño sí son suficientes para  acabar con las dificultades y lograr lo  que se quiere.

Miguel después de estar alejado por tres años de su hermano Iván que le tomó la delantera por culpa de la misma enfermedad, estará con él observando cómo en cada amigo y familiar dejaron un recuerdo y ejemplo que servirán para enfrentar la vida de una manera diferente. 

Migue: hoy y siempre serás recordado y querido, gracias por dejar tantas enseñanzas y sonrisas. Hasta siempre

Headline: De FIU a la Zona Cero: El receso de primera adopta nuevas formas
Subheadline: Claudia P. Davis
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Daytona Beach, Cancún, Panama City, Jamaica&#8230;¿la Zona Cero en Nueva York?   Increíble, pero definitivamente cierto.   Para un grupo de 15 jóvenes de FIU, encabezado por Alex Farut, la Zona Cero se convirtió en el lugar de predilección este pasado receso de primavera o "Spring Break".

Pero no se asusten.  La ciudad de Nueva York no ha convertido la Zona Cero en un área de entretenimiento con fines lucrativos.  No, el lugar sigue siendo aún el recordatorio del desastre más grande ocurrido en la historia de los Estados Unidos a manos de terroristas.  Entonces, ¿cómo se explica que un grupo de jóvenes estudiantes decida dejar atrás el sol y playa para visitar la devastación de la Zona Cero?

Alex Farut explica, "Si pides a la gente que done su dinero ahora para la causa de septiembre 11, es probable que no te lo den.  Pero si les das la oportunidad de donar su tiempo para ayudar, enseguida lo quieren hacer".  Las palabras de Alex se basan en hechos.  A dos días de haber anunciado al cuerpo estudiantil de FIU que la oportunidad de ayudar en la Zona Cero estaba disponible, el Centro de Acción Voluntaria recibió más de 60 solicitudes.  "No esperábamos tantas solicitudes.  Fue imposible llevar a todo el mundo", dice Farut.   De todos los estudiantes que solicitaron, sólo fueron 15 los escogidos.  Así emprendieron un viaje de "Spring Break" que los llevaría al corazón de la gran manzana; al lugar que ha despertado la sensibilidad de toda una nación y el mundo entero.

Las impresiones no se hicieron esperar.  Llegaron de noche, a la ciudad de Nueva Jersey, y lo primero que divisaron a lo lejos fueron dos rayos de luz opaca que parecían tocar el cielo.  Estas dos luces, paralela una con la otra, han sido de los primeros monumentos establecidos para conmemorar la gran pérdida de septiembre 11.  Para Alex, una vez en el area del desastre, la impresión fue de asombro.  "Parecía como si hubiera caído una bomba&#8230;los edificios todos rotos y una tremenda cantidad de escombros".  La determinación y espíritu de los trabajadores fueron otras de las cosas que afectaron positivamente a este joven universitario.  "Los trabajadores de rescate no perdían nada de tiempo.  Comían su comida rápido y regresaban otra vez al sitio de trabajo&#8230;aún tienen tanto por hacer pues todavía queda mucha gente perdida que no han identificado", dice Farut con cierta melancolía.

Haber servido de apoyo a estos trabajadores incansables inspiró a todos los estudiantes que participaron en esta causa.  El Centro de Acción Voluntaria de FIU en colaboración con el Salvation Army de Nueva York hicieron posible hacer pioneros de estudiantes.  Estos valientes han sido el primer grupo universitario en participar como voluntarios en la Zona Cero.  Para Alex Farut todo se resume en una analogía "Al igual que una persona gasta miles dólares en vacaciones para escalar el Everest y pasa hambre, frío y cansancio, así nosotros trabajamos durante nuestras vacaciones.  Sí, llegamos cansados.  Pero si nos dan la oportunidad de hacerlo de nuevo, lo volveríamos hacer".  La verdad es que los chicos no tuvieron que escalar tan imponente montaña, pero se enfrentaron a la difícil tarea en la que se ve envuelto el mundo de hoy; desafiar al mal contribuyendo con lo mejor de la calidad humana.

Habriendo el apetito intelectual de todos los presentes en el CP 145, la Dra. Caroline Simpson, ofreció el pasado viernes una simpàtica charla sobre nuestro vecino planeta Venus.  Utilizando gràficas e interesantes imágenes, la Dra. Simpson, quien es miembro de la facultad del departamento de fìsica en University Park, presentó la realidad detrás de Venus; un planeta envuelto en nubes de gases sulfúricos, con temperaturas que alcanzan hasta 900 grados Fahrenheit.  Esta ponencia informal es parte de un organizado esfuerzo del Southern Cross Astronomical Society y la universidad, para facilitar la disponibilidad de informaciòn a todos los interesados en el vasto campo de la ciencia.

	En el 1922 S. Lynn Rhorer estableció un pequeño observatorio cerca del río de Miami donde reunía un grupo de astrónomos aficionados.  Usando únicamente un refractor Clark de cinco pulgadas, Rhorer pudo atraer a suficientes astrónomos para impartir instrucción gratuita al público.  Entre dichos astrónomos se encontraba el Dr. Harlow Sharpley a quien se le atribuye la originalidad del nombre de la sociedad astrónomica, The Southern Cross.  Además de haber estado detrás del empuje para hacer posible la existencia del Museo de Ciencias de Miami, The Southern Cross y el departamento de fìsica de FIU han compartido una benefiosa asociación desde el 1986.  

	Cada tercer viernes del mes el departamento, junto a SCAS, organizan una serie de pláticas que brindan la más reciente información sobre los fenómenos astronómicos al igual que refrigerios, entretenimiento musical y la observación estelar por medio de potentes instrumentos telescópicos.  La "Fiesta de Estrellas", como se le llama a estas reuniones, fomentan la curiosidad e interès de los presentes al permitir preguntas y comentarios durante o despuès de cada ponencia.  La actitud de los presentadores, en su mayorìa miembros de la facultad de FIU, es relajada, amena y muy abierta.

	La próxima oportunidad de disfrutar el banquete intelectual de una "Fiesta de Estrellas" será el viernes, 20 de septiembre en el CP 145.  El presidente actual de The Southern Cross Astronomical Society, Lester Shalloway, ofrecerá información sobre la poderosa acción explosiva alrededor de la superficie solar.

Headline: "Knight Foundation" dona $20,000 a FIU para implementar nuevo programa periodístico en Perú
Subheadline: Betzy Belén Almaguer
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
"Knight foundation" con el objetivo de defender la libertad de prensa, ha donado $3.5 millones para implementar y expandir programas periodísticos en latinoamérica.  Varias universidades de los Estados Unidos se beneficiarán de estas donaciones para unirse a la misma causa de la fundación "Knight".  Entre estas escuelas se encuentra la Universidad Internacional de la Florida que recibió un total de $20,000 con la intención de implementar un centro regional conjuntamente con un programa piloto en Perú.  

Según John Virtue, delegado de asuntos internacionales en el departamento de comunicaciones, "la televisión se ha convertido en el medio más creible en Latinoamerica y desafortunadamente se encuentra en un punto de decadencia; especialmente en Perú donde la televisión a tenido consecuencias negativas como resultado de la problemática con Montesinos".  Es un problema que está evolucionando en otros medios periodísticos, incluyendo la radio y la prensa, lo cual pone en tela de juicio la reputación periodística y la ética profesional en este país.  

Por esta misma razón FIU ha ofrecido una propuesta al Knight Foundation para que, con la ayuda de la donación, se implementen programas educativos periodísticos en este país latinoamericano donde la libertad de prensa corre un alto riesgo. Virtue afirma que "la universidad pretende incorporar seminarios sobre la escritura, la ética profesional, el reportaje, y el periodismo investigativo en general", lo cual será un gran beneficio para los periodistas peruanos con el objetivo restablecer el profesionalismo periodístico.  Del programa también se beneficiarán alrededor de 7,000 periodistas latinoamericanos para propagar la libertad de prensa en América Latina.  

Todavía no se ha obtenido una respuesta concreta sobre la aprobación de este proyecto por parte de la fundación.  FIU está considerando la posibilidad de emprender el programa el próximo año dependiendo de la decisión que se tome . Mientras tanto, la escuela de comunicaciones mantiene sus expectativas de poder abrir sus puertas a profesionales del periodismo en Perú.

Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
The Florida International University Women's Soccer team lost its second and third straight matches this past week to South Florida and Florida Atlantic. 

Jacksonville 1, FIU 0
FAU 3, FIU 0

The Golden Panthers, who had been outshot 73-24 on the year coming into the game, kept pace in this outing, equaling USF's number of shots attempted (7). Junior Goalkeeper Adrienne McWilliams rebounded from a poor outing by allowing only one goal on the afternoon, though that goal became the difference in the game.

Women's Soccer lost to the Owls, dropping a 4-0 decision to Florida Atlantic at home. Florida Atlantic won its first ever match against the Golden Panthers thanks to a hat trick effort from Senior Forward Trina Maso de Moya.

The FAU Owls had been 0-17 all-time versus FIU coming into the game.
Maso de Moya, a graduate student who completed her undergraduate work at Wake Forest, scored her first points of the season on the three goals. She now leads the team with six points.

Their losing streak is officially over. The men's soccer team had its first victory of the 2002 season against FAU, 4-1. The Golden Panthers played the Owls on Saturday night at Boca Raton, and the team boosted its record to 1-4-0.

		FIU 4, FAU 1

FIU ruled the first half of the match with 3 evenly spread-out goals. Just ten minutes into the game, FIU's senior forward Matias Asorey scored with an assist from defender/midfielder Billy Boswell. In the 24th minute, sophomore forward Alvaro Aservi made the second goal. Confusion in the FAU penalty area allowed Aservi to move and score past their goalkeeper Anders Granstad. The 30th minute extended the lead of the Golden Panthers, as defender Allen Handy made a goal off a pass by sophomore Oscar Gill.

Matias Asorey began dominating the second half as well, scoring once again in the 71st minute. FAU made its first and only goal two minutes later. Owl Bjorn Totland assisted Kristoffer Aarskog in making this goal. It was not enough to win the game. FAU now drops to 1-3-1.

Headline: Turnbull turns heads in FIU's secondary
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As the bell rings at Flanagan high school in Pembroke Pines, Fl., one of the nation's largest, over 5,000 students proceed to their next class, some more nonchalantly than others.  However, there is probably one familiar face that would be excluded from all this, especially come the late autumn months, carrying over to spring. Nick Turnbull, a 6'2", 215-pound defensive back, has opted to wait in his previous classroom until the sea of students has been reduced to a few stragglers.  Turnbull is an all world, prototypical athlete that is seen ever so often on the silver screen and at every high school in America.  He's the big man on campus, state record holder for career interceptions with 23, two sport star that doesn't catch a break from fellow students asking him numerous questions while he strolls through the hallway like anyone else would, or should be allowed to do.  

"When I was in high school it was pretty bad, everyday kids would ask me the same questions," says Turnbull. "That just got annoying." 

However, the student body's obsession with knowing a part of Nick's life wasn't farfetched or premature by any means. After all, he was heavily sought after by many prominent college programs, as well as some perennial powerhouses within the state of Florida. He boasts such accolades as Southeast Region All-American, which he covets the most, All-State, and all county three years in a row. All this while being a four-year letterman, and starter for the Falcon's varsity squad. At times, he wasn't even up to date with all the awards he was winning or what he was on the verge of accomplishing as far as the interception record goes.  It was an old coach that informed him of his awards won when Nick went to visit, and his high school coach was the one that informed him prior to his senior year that he only needed four more interceptions in order to take over the record. 

Prior to, and during his senior year, while recording 193 tackles and going for the interception record, Nick drew the attention of Florida, Georgia, Boston College, Colorado State, and Pittsburgh to name a few.  
However, it was an up and coming, upstart program in the heart of southwest Miami-Dade that caught Nick's eye and stuck by him during trying times. Once signing day approached Nick's SAT scores were a few points away from the NCAA Clearinghouse's standards. Once this occurred, pretty much everyone stopped calling him, with the exception of FIU.  "They told me what I had to do, and once I got that up, more schools started calling me," says Turnbull. "I just ignored them." From that moment on Nick knew where he wanted to go, and decided to stick with the school that stuck with him throughout.  To this day he has no regrets and hopes to make the I-AA playoffs this year.  

When it comes to being around the team, he's somewhat of a vocal leader but also admits he's pretty laid back as well.  "Everyone will be listening to the radio, jumping around, dancing and I'll just be to myself, getting my mind right for the game."  

He tries to lead by example more so than he does by talking.   Things like this are what got him elected one of the seven, team captains and makes Nick feel respected by his teammates. 

Roommate Greg Moss, cousin of Santana Moss, and defensive backs coach Hurlie Brown spoke volumes about Nick's athleticism and talent.  However, coach Brown also noted that he was still learning the game.
"Probably one of the better athletes we got. He's still in the process of learning the game and learning the schemes," says Brown. "His athleticism speaks for itself. One of the better athletes I've ever been around."

Already he is one of the team's leading tacklers, which is no easy feat at free safety, and is credited with the first interception in the program's history. 

However, "The Truth", as all his neighborhood friends and teammates know him, happens to have the inability to do his dishes at times according to Moss. Also, he catches a lot of heat for always carrying his book bag everywhere he goes.  That can probably be attributed to the time when he lost his keys during fall practice his first year at FIU.  Nick admitted he even looked in the garbage can after driving himself and three other roommates at the time to near insanity.  "All of a sudden this guy comes up to me after everyone is gone, and he's like are your keys the ones with the football on them?  I'm like why didn't you give them to me, and he just said you never asked."  

"He carries a book bag everywhere he goes, even if he just has his keys in it," says Rashod Smith, another roommate of Turnbull's. "He wants to make sure he doesn't lose anything." Turnbull just plays the game and doesn't worry about anything other than that. He wants the spotlight on him, but knows that everyone wants the same.  However, he knows that he wants the spotlight because you see him on the field, and the fruits of his labor are paying him dividends every time he lines up. 

Truth be told, Turnbull's more concerned with what his brothers and father have to tell him.  "They always support me and tell me what I am doing wrong, even though I know I'm doing it right." Nick's handling of the spotlight can probably be attributed to watching the way his siblings, all of whom were great football players, did the same.  

Turnbull has been playing football since he was four, when he was a part of his two older brothers' Pop Warner team. "I was playing football before I started school."Maybe that is the reason for his athleticism and talent, but after that talent shines day in and day out, rest assured that he will walk out of that locker room with his book bag securely in hand.

Headline: Football dominates Butler
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Golden Panthers looked as if to be shot out of a cannon on Saturday afternoon against Butler University, who was coming off of a 54-31 win over Division II Tiffin.  Without wasting any time, FIU scored early and often en route to their 42-0 shellacking of Butler at Community Stadium in front of 9,110 spectators.

Returnman Bill Grant, who is also a backup half back, enabled the Golden Panthers to begin their first drive with ideal field position at the 50-yardline after the game's first kick.

Don Strock's quick strike offense went to work as Jamie Burke hit tight end Joseph Struyf over the middle with a dart that went for a 25-yard gain. On the very next play Rashod Smith appeared to have been stopped for a minimal gain but quickly bounced out to the left side, leaving Butler defenders in his tracks as he went in to the end zone untouched from 25 yards out.

Coach Strock would hand all the credit to Smith, as he cited a lack of blocking by the offensive line until later on in the game. 

"At halftime I told the guys, you better tip your hat to number 4 over there, because he broke a lot of tackles, bounced it outside and did it on his own. The first two touchdowns were pretty much his, he made one cut one way or the other and he was gone," said Strock.  

"One run was all him, because I don't know if we blocked anybody on that run, he struggled a little bit and just bounced it out and took in to the end zone for the touchdown." 

Contrary to what Strock had to say about his line, Rashod Smith begged to differ.  "I know I had to break tackles, but I knew I had to get through the line first before I can break tackles. 

They see something from the sidelines, but I saw holes, so I guess the line was blocking," said Smith, who was battling a cold, and saw fatigue get the best of him in the game's latter stages, even though he would no longer be needed to render his services given the score.   Smith added; "As I run the ball, I just go on instincts, I don't know what's happening, it just happens."

Contrasting last week's events, Adam Moss was 6 for 6 on point after attempts and would make it 7-0 FIU with over 14:00 minutes to play in the first.

On the ensuing kickoff, Justin Campbell of Butler would return the ball to the 23 yard line before it would be jarred loose by Jermell Weaver and recovered by Terran Bell at the Butler 23.  One play later, Burke connected with Julius Eppinger, as he dove and snared the ball in the end zone before it hit the turf, enhancing FIU's lead to 14-0.

Butler would show signs of life for the first time halfway through the first quarter when they put together a 9 play, 33 yard drive that went for naught after Butler quarterback Travis Delphi failed to connect with Robert Leonard on fourth and four.

Shortly thereafter, Burke connected with Struyf, who had four catches for 79 yards, tacking off another huge chunk of yardage. Smith was held to a dismal two yard gain on first down, but busted loose on second down giving himself another touchdown, this time one which went for 39 yards. Smith turned in a stellar performance as he finished with 116 yards rushing on 14 attempts including 3 touchdowns. With this feat, Smith became the first Golden Panther to rush for over 100 yards in a game.
FIU and Butler exchanged punts on their following possessions respectively. 

The inevitable would then occur as Jamie Burke would see his youth get the best of him. Burke threw into double coverage, while going against a menacing wind only to be intercepted. Strock blamed this interception on shear inexperience, as he said at his press conference. 

"Jamie checked and then threw in double coverage, but that's a freshman mistake." Besides that blemish, Burke was sensational once again; connecting on 13 for 19 passes for a total of 258 yards and 3 touchdowns.

"I think we prepared well for this game this week. We were really clicking this week and it showed today," said Burke.

Clicking they were, because right after a Butler punt, Burke would come out and hit Cory McKinney, who led all receivers with 4 grabs for 107 yards. 

McKinney was battling two defenders vying for the ball as he went up and came down with the pigskin prior to completing the 59 yard score.

Butler's defense looked helpless as the Golden Panthers would go and tack on two more scores.  Juxtaposed, FIU's defense looked like a pack of rabid dogs, as they flew to the ball in such a way that drew comparisons to their neighbors to the east after the game.  

The Golden Panthers' D saw itself accumulate eight sacks for a total of 49 yards. Leading the pack with two sacks apiece were Payton Williams, who also had 6 tackles including 3 for loss, Duante Foster (4 tackles for loss, 5 total) and Terrance Allen (3 tackles, and 2 went for a loss).  Nick Carreno had a sack of his own and partially attributed the defenses' success to the fact that Butler's offense is somewhat similar to the one they see so often in practice.

"We did a really good job controlling the trenches today.  Last week we had a hard time at Elon, but we came together as a unit this week and we really stepped up and did a good job with that," Carreno added after the game. 

Leading all tacklers for the Golden Panthers was University of Miami transfer Jermell Weaver.  Jermell, whose brother still plays for the Hurricanes, was a standout defensive end at Northwestern high. 
Weaver recorded seven tackles, and was the cause of a few Butler mishaps, causing two fumbles.  

"I played safety at Miami, but I can count how many times I actually played.  To be here and play as long as I did felt real good," Weaver said.

Coach Strock reiterated to his football team throughout the week that this was a game they should win. 

Next week, a showdown with the run-oriented offense of Bethune Cookman at Ft. Lauderdale's Lockhart Stadium would be the real test.    
Weaver had no problems attesting to that: "[Butler] was not up to par. We just have to take this game in stride, and be ready for next week because next week is the real test."

Last Wednesday, I turned on the news hoping to find out the results of the previous day's primary election.  Instead, I was bombarded by 24-hour newscasts exploiting the events of Sept. 11.  

On one channel, there was an interview with a little girl who had lost her father in the attack.  

"It feels like it was only yesterday," she said.

"No kidding," I thought.

Everywhere you look there are tributes, memorials, photos, books, and interviews with survivors; there is even a Sept. 11 video at Blockbuster. 

With the constant barrage of reminders of that day, it is nearly impossible for friends and relatives of victims to move past their grief.  

Instead of helping, the government has only made the situation worse.  At the Ground Zero anniversary ceremony, Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Secretary of State Colin Powell, and others read aloud the names of all 2,801 victims for friends and family to hear.  

Although the surviving relatives probably wanted their fallen loved ones to be acknowledged, I'm sure each of those names was a stab in the heart. 

 To make it worse, President Bush has officially made Sept. 11 a national holiday: Patriot Day.  Undoubtedly, this holiday will soon become capitalized and lose its meaning like every other holiday in the United States.  Let's face it, Valentine's Day is about chocolate and jewelry &#8211; not love &#8211; and Easter is about eggs and bunny rabbits more than it is about Christ.  

I can picture it now, car dealers and department stores announcing their "Once a Year Big Patriot Day Sale."  Like Memorial Day, Patriot Day will soon become nothing more than an excuse to go to the beach and the mall.  Or maybe, like Groundhog Day, it will merely be forgotten. 

Declaring Sept. 11 a national holiday and the center of Ground Zero the "Circle of Honor," suggests that the lives of those who died in the attack are somehow more important than those of the thousands of people who die each day from cancer, AIDS, homicide and other causes. The day of the Oklahoma City bombing and the day of the Pearl Harbor bombing are not national holidays and the day of the World Trade Center bombing should not be either. 

For all those who lost loved ones on that day, the events of Sept. 11 are permanently engraved in their reality.  They do not need daily reminders of their loss &#8211; such as the two-story banner in GC that somberly reads "In Memory of Sept. 11" and contains a myriad of pictures resulting from the tragedy.  

More than a year has passed since that day, and it is time we stop saturating ourselves with painful memories of something that we cannot change.  All we can do is accept what happened, make whatever resolutions are necessary to prevent it from happening again, and ultimately, move on with our lives.  

If you dwell in the past, you cannot have a future.

Those who fell victim to the terrorist attacks should never be forgotten; however, it is imperative that we as a nation, and as individuals deal with our grief and move on, if we hope to embrace a brighter tomorrow.

Headline: Web journals encourage exhibitionism
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
About a week or so ago, I took one of those online quizzes that you find randomly and, despite knowing they're completely full of malarkey, become curious as what your result will be. 

The exact title of this test was "What's *Your* Secret Fetish?" My fetish was exhibitionism. If you knew me, you'd find that very amusing. Sure, I can be a bit of an extrovert, but around strangers, I become very reclusive and shy. 

Trust me, folks. As far as I'm concerned, I am not an exhibitionist. The concept would be just, well, creepy.

But then I realized how much of an exhibitionist I am, when I noticed I was uploading said results into my web journal, so that anyone who came across it could find out that this test branded me an exhibitionist. 

Not only that, I had gone on to include my exact personal reaction to this, so people would know I was confused by my results. The irony was sickening.

But at the same time, it answered a big question I had been wondering: why the hell do I even own a web journal? Answer: apparently, I'm an exhibitionist of sorts.

Web journals are also known as weblogs (or as I really prefer to call them, "blogs"). The concept behind blogs is simple: whenever you feel like it, you post your thoughts – what you did or will do, dreams, random miscellany, links to stuff you find interesting, etc. This can be as often as once every few minutes or as seldom as once every few weeks. Once posted, anyone can read it. It's a bit like having your diary nailed to the front of your house; if someone happens to come across it, you've got no problem with them reading it. 

But what makes blogging so much fun? What has me addicted, so to speak, to my newly discovered "fetish"? 

I've been asked this question by many people, including my family, my friends and even my coworkers who put together this very newspaper you're reading, but I've never been able to successfully answer it.

When you think about it, the concept makes no damn sense. You post your innermost thoughts and desires on the net for anyone to see and read. That's crazy. 

Why would you want to hang your dirty laundry in the front lawn? Someone, maybe your boss or a friend, could read something you posted about him or her and become outraged. I've actually seen this happen to people. It's not pretty. 

Or suppose I'm having a really bad time in a relationship. I can't just go and post really critical comments about my hypothetical girlfriend, because she reads my journal, as do her friends. It's just asking for trouble. So why would I do it?

I suppose on some superficial level it's a craving for attention, a private desire to be seen and noticed. Sure, it makes sense. We all crave attention. It's a huge chunk of what dating is all about: Finding someone who's willing to give you their attention in exchange for your attention. And anyone who knows me can verify I'm a bit of an attention-lover.

But if this were true, couldn't my stints in acting classes have brought it out? I enjoyed acting, but I didn't feel a desire to be on the stage. When I was, I become a bumbling fool, barely able to remember lines. And people were watching me, which only made matters worse. What if something went wrong? I'd be mortified. No, acting was simply not for me; there had to be something else.

A few days ago, I figured it out. It's not about attention; it's about connection. I've connected with people all over the world and made new friends over the most interesting things: sickness, taste in movies, cultural geekdom, etc. The other day, I was giving advice to someone I've never met about his love life. 

Then, another one of his friends that neither one of us had ever met, replied praising my advice and including her own thoughts. Three complete strangers, a Canadian, a Nevadan and a Floridian, all bonding over some geek's inability to get any. Both peculiar and poignant if you ask me.

But you don't have to ask me. Just look at the thousands of websites devoted to blogging – LiveJournal and DeadJournal and Blogger and more. You've got people owning multiple accounts for different aspects of their personas and message boards designed to connect people with others who share similar quirky tastes (who's interested in meeting other fans of John Ritter?). 

I now realize this column is the final bit of evidence I need to verify my exhibitionist tendencies. I'm writing a column for my entire school to read about how my blog helped me discover my budding exhibitionism. 

I'm exposing myself about exposing myself. Psychology students will be pounding on my door. 

But don't worry, I won't actually expose myself to anyone. 

And you can forget about getting the address to my blog too. I have to draw the line on my privacy somehow.

Headline: US should not attack Iraq without UN support
Author: David Pulgar
&nbsp;
As a student with a job, a girlfriend, a band and all that good stuff I'm really busy. Late night television has become my CNN and Jay Leno my Dan Rather.  Despite this, I do sometimes pull my head out of a book long enough to notice major world issues.

Of great concern to me recently is this impending war on Iraq. History, and more specifically the history of war, has always interested me. Still I find it puzzling how telling your impending enemy they will be attacked helps our cause at all. What's next? Are we going to march our soldiers forward in a firing line like we did in the Civil War?

Don't misunderstand me, I support military action against Iraq, but I question the strategy that might get us there. President Bush is calling for a regime change and drumming up support for war. Though he says a peaceful solution is first on his list, the president's finger looks awfully close to the trigger. He seems resolute on war no matter what the United Nations might have to say.  

What good is attacking Iraq if we bypass the United Nations? Continuing our plan without their blessing is turning away from what the United Nations stands for. However, if we let Iraq go and weapons inspectors are still not allowed who knows what will happen.

Considering both sides of the argument I noticed an interesting parallel in history. Some 50 years ago a man named Adolf Hitler re-militarized Germany after the Treaty of Versailles clearly prohibited him from doing so. He broke laws, bent rules and managed to equip himself with a very powerful and capable army. With this new force he took control of Europe, murdering millions, and all because no one wanted to fight.

Then again, we didn't have a United Nations in the 1940's. In fact, it was World War II that spawned the United Nation's creation.  If we go to war against Iraq alone we lose face with other countries; but if we take no action we resign ourselves to whatever dangers the future may bring.

Should we go to war? Should we act alone? Should we go against what the world thinks is right? Yes, if we can prove it's warranted. To make a case against Iraq we need more evidence. Just knowing Saddam Hussein is looking for the materials to make weapons of mass destruction is not enough.

We do not know for certain if Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction. What we do know is he will have the capacity to develop them soon. Hussein only lacks time and raw materials. 

With a history like Saddam's no one needs to guess that he's up to no good. During the gulf war, Hussein used chemical weapons against civilian populations. At times he even used his own people as human shields. He dictates a society where information is controlled and freedom is nonexistent. 

Sept. 11 left us mourning and angry. We went after the al-Qaeda, but how much damage can you do to an organization that works in the shadows and feeds on hatred. Iraq could prove to be a more tangible outlet for our anger. I hope this is not the case. To press forward with this attack we need a campaign based on facts not emotions. Patriotism will only carry us so far. Before we start a war, let's make sure that we are fighting for the good of everyone involved.

Winners

Bill McBride: Two week ago, most of us had no clue who you even were. Next thing we know, you actually swiped the election right from under Janet Reno. Even if she had demanded a recount and wound up farther ahead, you'd still be a winner just for cutting in on her little dance party.

FIU Football: It's getting to the point where we no longer cheer our football team, but just feel pity to our opponents. Extra thumbs-up for Rashod Smith, the first FIU running back to rush over 100 yards in a game.   

Medical School "Terrorists": Congratulations on creating the grandest nationwide hoax since Orson Welles signed off the radio waves. Who'd have thought that a vague reference to "bringing it down" could have all of Florida in a state of panic? 

Losers

Janet Reno:  This is really a defacto "Losers" since you officially lost the election. In reality, you deserve a hearty applause for being the better candidate and choosing to support the winner, instead of demanding recount after recount. You almost make up for Florida's incompetence. Almost.

Florida Elections:  No butterfly ballots. No hanging chads. No weird guy looking for dimples. Yet, we still managed to make ourselves look like a state full of backwater idiots that haven't learned to count to twenty.  

Medical School "Terrorists": You also deserve congratulations for destroying your careers, but showing the world what kind of a neurotic government we have. It's good to know that vague statements that could be misconstrued as a threat can make someone Public Enemy No. 1.

Headline: Letter to the editor: Reader responds to reading assignment debate
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

The recent debate within the pages of The Beacon point out some interesting ideas. Not only is it an imposition for the University of North Carolina to have its freshmen study an alien religion, but it is most likely a violation of the Constitution, which forbids the establishment of an official religion.

Indeed, as Ms. Smith pointed out, the assignment is an extreme example of hypocrisy and bias on the part of our "educators." 

In a society in which the ACLU regards a non-denominational prayer at a high-school football game as an anathema to the concept of the "separation of church and state," it is inconsistent for righteous civil libertarians to be AWOL in the face of this forcible, taxpayer-funded mingling of mosque and state. 

It seems that in academia, some violations of this principle are unacceptable while others are commendable.
It is a fact of this life that empirical evidence counts, and we are judged by our actions and behavior. I fail to see why Islam and its followers deserve a pass. 
It matters little that the majority of Muslims in this world are "peaceful" and that their holy text does not encourage violence. 

The fact is, all too often, Islam is a philosophical foundation for terror. 
In every corner of the world, followers of this peaceful religion are committing atrocities in its name and treating their non-Muslim neighbors with ghastly cruelty.
In the Moluccan islands, Laskar Jihad, the local arm of al-Qaida, promised and proceeded to deliver the Christian community there a very bloody Christmas. 

Non-Muslims were given a choice of conversion or beheading. Where is the outrage? 

Do you suppose the Moluccan people are glad that Islam doesn't condone violence?
In Sudan, Christians and other non-Muslims are rounded up by slave traders and sold to wealthy Saudis and Egyptians as scullery maids and sex toys. 

In Sudan, Christians and other non-Muslims are rounded up by slave traders and sold to wealthy Saudis and Egyptians as scullery maids and sex toys. In this modern-day Jihad by the northern Muslim government, the goal of establishing an Islamic state is being carried out by the most violent means possible – presumably another distortion of the Koran – so where is the outrage of this decent Muslim majority we keep hearing about? Does it really matter to Sudanese Christians and Animists that what they are experiencing is not condoned by Islam?

Say what you will about Islamic restrictions, but the attacks on our country only confirmed what most Americans know by common sense – that most terrorism is committed by practicing Muslims – and that little or nothing is being done by Muslims themselves to reverse the trend. 

On the first anniversary of Sept. 11, a pro bin-Laden rally entitled "Sept. 11, a Towering Day in History," was held in London's Finsbury Park. Sheik Omar Bahkri Mohamed said of al-Qaida, "...we share...the same objectives, but we don't share their structure or their method." Thank God.

Headline: In Our View: Florida primaries prove that new election system not ready for big leagues
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Before the 2000 presidential election, the word "chad" wasn't a very common part of our collective everyday vocabulary, outside its common usage as a name.

For a number of weeks, that word was everywhere. And not just one type of chad either. Suddenly, there were "hanging chads," "pregnant chads," and "dimpled chads."

The one thing they all had in common was a negative connotation, one that managed to make the entire State of Florida look like a breeding ground for stupidity.  

After the mess that was the last presidential election, much of Florida was left to bow its head in shame.  Miscalculated votes, confusion at the polls and other problems like these are simply something that should not occur, especially in a state that is a member of the political "big four," the four major states that generally have the biggest influence on elections.  

This year, Florida seemed determine to bounce back from this election debacle.  During the recent primary elections, sophisticated electronic machinery replaced the old ballots. Surely, if we couldn't handle an election by ourselves, expensive computers could sort out human error, right?

Well, not exactly. 

It seems we failed to guarantee certain other crucial things.  

For one thing, several precincts failed to comply with the mandated two-hour poll extensions and closed their doors before they were supposed to.

In addition, we also failed to realize that if certain Floridians encountered trouble understanding a paper ballot, computers might be even more confusing – even if they were seemingly straight-forward touch screens.  While it may seem simple to many of us who have grown up using computers, many people don't understand them – in fact, many downright fear them.  

Most importantly, we failed to guarantee that, at the very least, the staff at all the precincts understood the equipment and could carry out the election process properly.  

So, considering all the problems that plagued this election, it seems logical that candidates like former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno would desire a recount.  In fact, days after the votes were initially tabulated, approximately 2,511 uncounted votes have been discovered.  And so, just like that, nearly two years after the presidential election fiasco, we find ourselves talking about recounts again. 

It's difficult to say what it will take to restore order to Florida elections, but after using the primary election as a guinea pig, we pretty much know where the big problems are, and have time to resolve them.  

There is absolutely no reason why we should encounter these concerns again at the general elections in November.

But we probably will.

Headline: Terrafly allows users to fly over US, part of world
Subheadline: FIU project gets worldwide recognition
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Terrafly is making headlines once again.  A project of the High Performance Database Research Center at FIU, the internet-based program utilizes satellite imagery and aerial photography to allow users to virtually "fly" over the continental United States. 

"At the moment we have sporadic world coverage in some areas, but the critical mass of the coverage is in the [United States]," Founder and Research Director Dr. Naphtali Rishe said. 

He hopes that coverage will expand to the rest of the globe within four years.  In the meantime, Terrafly is not going unnoticed.

Since the launch of the website on Oct. 26, 2001, it has received renown from several publications worldwide.  Last month, it was featured in The New York Times and The Miami Herald, amongst others.  Most recently, on Sept. 6, it was featured in The Bismarck Tribune.

The HPDRC has also won several awards for its website, including DM Review's World Class Solution Award, The Miami Herald's Business Monday Award, and USA Today's Hot Site Award.  

Project Manager Andriy Selivonenko said that receiving national exposure has been "exciting - a new experience."

Currently, Terrafly hosts over 10,000 unique users per day.  To "fly," users must first log on to the home page at www.terrafly.com and enter a street address.  A window with an aerial view of the location as well as a control window will appear on the screen.  

To navigate the image, the user only needs to click the mouse on the edge of the screen.  Clicking on a point on the map brings up a window with demographical information about that location, such as nearby schools and hospitals.

Rishe hopes to incorporate more demographical information &#8211; like flood zones and more educational data &#8211; in the future.  Also, he plans on improving the program's navigation system.

"We are trying to make it faster and more user-friendly," he said.

At the present time, users can view images in resolutions up to one meter.  The images, which are mostly compiled from United States Geological Survey data, can be purchased in sections on the website.

"We have an exclusive agreement with USGS, and that is the biggest thing that Terrafly has - that nobody else in the [United States] can sell USGS data online," said graduate student and Technology Transfer Assistant Manish Jain.

Apart from providing images, the government has also contributed to the project in other ways.  According to the Terrafly website, government funding to the HPDRC is in excess of $17 million, with NASA and the National Science Foundation being the primary contributors.

Private industry has stepped in to help as well.  IBM has donated $6.7 million in hardware and software for the project.  According to Jain, the total contribution from all sponsors is about $25 million.

Like Jain, several other students have taken advantage of the HPDRC's work-study program.  Students who are employed by the HPDRC can receive up to up to 100 percent of their tuition, in addition to a weekly salary.  

 "It's a very good business model.  It's very good for the school and students get a lot of experience here," said senior Ramon Khamzin, who works as a research assistant in the HPDRC.  

Graduate student Alejandro Mendoza also works as a research assistant.  He helps with the development of software for Terrafly.

"I wanted to get involved in some research area and the development of software and I got to do both," he said.

Mendoza is grateful for the opportunity to work at HPDRC and believes that his experience there will help him in the future.  He views the project as a positive step for FIU.

"I think the project is great.  It's given the university exposure," he said. 

Selivonenko and Rishe are also excited about Terrafly's possible implications for FIU, and they have high hopes for its future.  

Selivonenko hopes that Terrafly will eventually be able to "provide any data and any service which is geographically related."

"We hope it will be a good service for the whole world.  It is an outreach program, so that the name of FIU will be visible country-wide," Rishe said.

Headline: New grants benefit future FIU students
Author: Christina Kent / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The U.S. Department of Education awarded FIU two grants to bolster its outreach programs. 

The Title V Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) award totals $2.1 million and will be used to enrich existing programs like Freshman Orientation and Freshman Interest Groups (FIGs), while boosting technology for tutorials that complement these programs. Money from the second grant, TRIO, will focus on executing the Talent Search Program, which tracks and prepares local middle and high school students who are prospective FIU attendees.

Both grants focus on low-income and minority students.

"FIU has a good relationship with local public school programs, [our] commitment is evident; it's there," said Dr. George E. Simms, Director of Grants and Research and principal investigator for the TRIO award. He said the Department of Education looks at overall enrollment, graduation track records, retention and "how the university is positioned to carry out objectives of the programs." 

Regarding the TRIO grant in 2001, $254,892,170 was awarded to colleges and universities nationwide, serving an estimated 199,956 students; 944 grants were awarded, and the average award was $270,013 according to the Department's Federal TRIO Programs website. 

FIU is amongst seven higher education facilities in the state that have the Talent Search programs; others include Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University and Bethune-Cookman.

"The TRIO is a very, very important program for the university," Simms said. "In my opinion, it's going to be the basis of a lot of things to come."

The principal investigators for the HSI grant were Simms and Vice Presidents Patricia Telles-Irvin and Rosa Jones.

The HSI award will support retention programs that follow students throughout their college careers. Additionally, FIU's Internet learning center, GATO, will be able to deliver improved tutorials due to technology funding from the grant.

"I think that the major, anticipated impact of this grant will be on the area of retention: the FIGs program gives students opportunities to build support systems among themselves, Jones said of the HSI award. 

"Faculty can now be more sensitive [to students' needs] and we have the opportunity to really infuse and impact a greater number of students. I'm excited about the fact that these outside resources can help us enhance these areas."

Another main objective of the Talent Search program is to tackle perspective FIU student's fears head-on.

"Most students are concerned that they won't have enough money to support them[selves] while they are here, or whether or not the university community will accept them," Simms said.

The first-year Talent Search program will allow the university to concentrate on middle and high schools farther north than FIU's usual 'feeder' schools - such as Brownsville, Northwestern and Hialeah-Miami Lakes - to help increase enrollment at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Ideas are already lined up to further improve FIU with the grant money. Simms says he is preparing another grant investigation for the McNair Post-Baccalaureate Program that would benefit Ph.D. students.

As for now, these five-year grants are valuable achievements for the university.

"The impact of TRIO is not as immediate as the HSI award because these students need to be tracked ... so two or three years down the road, they will show up at our doorstep," said Simms. "There will be a continuum with these students and they will be much better prepared to enter FIU: their performance in school right now will be affected because they want to become more eligible for the future."

Headline: "City by the Sea" imitates familiar pattern
Author: Christina Kent
&nbsp;
"History repeats itself" is the theme that pervades "City By The Sea," a movie where the father of a possible murderer does everything he can to help rescue his son from repeating a mistake his own father made. But nobody can rescue this film from seeming like a TV movie, one that we've seen many times under a variety of titles.

Vincent LaMarca (Robert De Niro), a middle-aged cop in New York City, seems to have a decent life. His one-year relationship with his girlfriend Michelle (Francis McDormand) is becoming more intense, and talks of a future together are emerging. But LaMarca's gloomy past storms back to him when he hears that his son, whom he left 14 years ago after a messy divorce, may be responsible for a drug-related murder in nearby Long Beach. 

This situation reminds LaMarca of his own father, who was sent to the chair after an "innocent" kidnapping resulted in the "accidental" death of the infant he abducted. The cop who arrested his father took the young Vincent under his wing and inspired him to later become a crime-fighter. But he says his unstable emotional state caused him to leave his kid, Joey (James Franco), who we now see as a drug-obsessed teen living in an dilapidated casino in the tourist-turned-ghetto town. What's worse is that Joey's mom, played by Patti LuPone, blames her son's junkie lifestyle on her ex-husband for neglecting the boy.

Originally, Vincent is put on the case by his department. When the press dredges up the stories of his past and the cursed "LaMarca" family name, he is given a week vacation to keep him off the case. Later, when he hears that his son may also be responsible for killing the cop who took the case, LaMarca arranges secret meetings with his son to discuss their past and the inevitable jail time facing Joey. "You know what cops do to cop-killers" is one of De Niro's fears. At this point, the plot becomes more predictable and it is easy to start counting the exit signs in the theater. 

So much about the film is just too cookie-cutter, like the super intimidating villain names: Spider, Snake and Picasso.

Among some powerfully emotional scenes, there is some comic relief and surprising plot twists. When Joey's girlfriend Gina (Eliza Dushku) shows up at Vincent's doorstep with the grandchild he never knew he had, De Niro's usually serious character is put to the test. Vincent's chummy relationship with an alcoholic bum that lives on the steps to his walk-up is lovely too.

Dushku's scenes are some of the most authentic, as she plays a hard-working young mom trying to get out of a vicious drug cycle. Franco delivers a convincing performance, however it is impossible to be sympathetic for his character due to his persistent stupidity. The chemistry between McDormand and De Niro – both Academy Award winners – is engaging and believable even if they have a flat dialogue. 

Their presence in the movie is what saves it from getting lost amidst all the other fall films. The acting is genuine, but at times, the formulaic plot gets in the way of what could have been a unique and poignant detective story.

After more than a two-year wait, Coldplay's sophomore release, A Rush Of Blood To The Head, comes as a messianic warrior for all that is good and just in popular music. 

In Rush, the British alterna-rock quartet refines its sound from its previous release, Parachutes, and quickly emerges with a more mature, very Coldplay sound – naked guitar riffs, emotionally packed falsetto vocals and estrogen-laced honesty. The album is filled with lovelorn tints of blue and green. It's good cheese.

Chris Martin's voice weaves in and out of emotional freefall like a tempered jazz love song. His lyrics don't add much, but his vocal sincerity charms your pants off. When in "Warning Sign" he sings "When the truth is, I miss you so/ And I'm tired/ I should not have let you go," your mind is prepared to dismiss it as something Diane Warren could have written, but his lack of cynicism and lustrous coating makes it entirely welcoming. 

The first single from the album, "In My Place," has the intensity of an '80s power ballad without the hairspray or the overtly flashy guitar solo. The captivating melody, carried out in a very Edge-like (U2's guitarist) manner by Jonny Buckland, shines through the simplistic musical arrangement. And Martin's quivering voice adds a desperate feel as he cries: "Singin' please, please, please, come back and sing to me."

 "Clocks" beams with subdued intensity. Gliding through a vast and delicate ethereal canvas, it explores broken images of a haunting love. 

The piano-driven melody along with Guy Berryman's urgent bass create an Enya-like surreal world of desperation. "Confusion never stops / Closing walls and ticking clocks," sings Martin. Through an escalating guitar chord progression, the song reaches its emotional peak as Martin declares: "Nothing else compares / Nothing else compares…." "Clocks" is perhaps the best track on the album and Martin surprisingly attempts to push his lyrical boundaries. It works beautifully.

"Green Eyes" is a simple love song backed up by a quasi-folk acoustic guitar. Unique from the rest of the tracks, the dissonant wails of Martin give the song a cheerful lightness. 

Buckland's buried slide guitar coats the song with a more happy-country-western feel. And although the lyrics are nothing but an infantile ode to a lover ("Honey you are a sea / upon which I float"), the sweetness of it can't be avoided.

Will Champion on drums gives a thumping start to "Politik": An admirable crack at a '60s-era social awareness anthem that goes wrong when in the end Martin tries to pull a Lennon-esque plead for love. But it's also the only track where Martin sings about something other than his own love wounds. "Look at earth from outer space /
Everyone must find a place." The track, unlike the rest, actually rocks out a bit, alternating between intense piano chopping and Buckland's distorted electric guitar.

In contrast to the sedated nature of Parachutes, this time Coldplay seems more willing to spare the blade – it's not all vein slitting. 

The band has finally left behind the Radiohead comparisons and shadow of their better-selling Scottish compatriots Travis, to become one of Britain's more exquisite imports.

With Chris Martin at the forefront as a more visible bandleader and wannabe international ambassador for free trade (or Mini-Bono), Coldplay has created a small masterpiece with A Rush Of Blood To The Head that indicates these little Brits are here to stay.

Headline: Fall films promise something for everyone
Author: John Lovell/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Ah yes, fall, the ever so elegant prelude to winter and a cool break from summer's heat. This is the time when the entertainment world gets revamped with a fresh batch of music, television shows and of course, movies. This year's lineup is filled with plenty of great films. Some even have Academy Award potential. Here's a list to get you acquainted with what's in store for the box office over the next few months.

Can "Red Dragon," the "Hannibal" prequel, be compared to those other famous "Star Wars" prequesl?  To answer that question, I'll ask you another: Does Anakin Skywalker eat anybody? Sadly, no. Reprising his role as Hannibal Lecter for a third time, Anthony Hopkins returns as the ever-so-helpful prisoner/ex-psychologist with a most peculiar appetite. Joining him for dinner is Oscar-nominee Edward Norton, who assumes the role of Lecter's captor. "Red Dragon" unveils the details the good Doctor's capture shortly before the storyline of "Silence of the Lambs." I'm hoping Edward Norton saves the latest, and hopefully last, Lecter flick.

I love it when fluffy actors pull a 180 and embrace the dark side of a cinematic character. "Dawson's Creek" wonder boy James Van Der Beek sets aside his wide-eyed WB character for "Rules of Attraction." Assuming the role of Sean, Van Der Beek plays a crack dealer/thrill seeker who falls in love in this gruesome story about the college experience. His part calls for some shocking scenes of attempted suicide and masturbation. Yes, I just said masturbation. Let's hope the darker side of Van Der Beek fares well with audiences.

Another actor who is switching sides this fall is lowbrow comedian Adam Sandler.  In "Punch-Drunk Love," Sandler plays a shy, tender character in the true story of a California salesman who buys thousands of pudding snacks to earn frequent flyer miles and, eventually, the heart of a businesswoman. Director Paul Thomas Anderson is attempting to make a real actor out of Sandler, as he did with Mark Wahlberg in "Boogie Nights." With rumors floating around of a possible Oscar nomination for Sandler's performance, "Punch-Drunk Love" looks to be one of the more interesting movies on the horizon.

Eminem, the notorious Detroit rapper who loves to upset everyone, is doing something different this fall.  He's trying his luck in the acting business. Although "8 Mile" is the story of a white rapper who deals with hardships of the Detroit hip-hop scene, along with a discouraging mother (Kim Basinger) and a cheating girlfriend (Brittany Murphy), Eminem denies this movie is biographical.

All you Harry Potter geeks should get really excited about this one. The next installment in the Potter movie series, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," brings back Hogwarts' fantastic wand-wielding, Quidditch-playing magic student, who has aged one year since we last saw him in "The Sorcerer's Stone." The adaptation of J.K. Rowling's second book in the widely popular series will move towards a darker plot. Kenneth Branagh joins the impressively large British cast from the first film.

James Bond, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways: 20 ways to be exact, with "Die Another Day," the twentieth installment to the 007 franchise. Pierce Brosnan returns, this time with Halle Berry, as the chick-magnet spy in an action packed movie about &#8211; what else? &#8211; secret missions, unlikely gadgets, British accents and hot loving. What's the plot? It's James Bond, for crying out loud. Hopefully, 007 can show this year's wannabe rookie-spies like "XXX" who's boss.

"Science fiction" and "good" aren't two words usually seen together in the context of film. It's extremely rare when a science fiction movie comes to life and turns out to be worth anyone's time. Steven Soderbergh's mysterious "Solaris," which reunites George Clooney with Soderbergh, is looking to be just that. With this remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 movie, Soderbergh hopes to enlighten audiences with a story that depicts Clooney as a widower psychologist sent to investigate the disturbing dreams and suicidal tendencies of a space station crew that is orbiting the planet Solaris. Before we know it, the space-shrink starts having his own dreams concerning his late wife.  The plot tease assures us that "Solaris" is a psychological thriller that makes this an addition to the fall line-up worthy of waiting for.

The epic "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is getting its second dose of Middle-Earth mayhem with "The Two Towers."  Tying up the loose ends and uncertainties "Fellowship" left us with, and most likely replacing them with another ambiguous ending, "Towers" reunites Frodo and friends in a bigger and bloodier sequel. Frodo (Elijah Wood) is starting to feel the effects of having been with the evil ring for quite some time so we'll most likely see a darker side to our little hobbit friend. Many worry that the middle chapter of a trilogy tends to lack impact, but with 600 estimated F/X shots, an all-out battle with 10,000 of those freaky looking orcs and CGI creatures up the wazoo, "Towers" looks like it will be a worthy successor.

The last time we had super-famous actors singing and dancing, we got "Moulin Rouge."  This time, it's the film version of the still-running Broadway musical, "Chicago." Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger star in the sexy story of two vamps, Roxie and Velma, on trial for different murder. Director Rob Marshall hopes "Chicago" will attract the same audience that took "Moulin Rouge" to the top of the charts. 

Leonardo DiCaprio has two movies out this fall; they're even being released on the same day. He plays the lead in probably the biggest movie of the fall season, Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York." Set in 1860's New York, the movie is the vengeful story of Amsterdam (DiCaprio) who seeks to set the record straight for the murder of his father by a certain Bill the Butcher (Daniel-Day Lewis). These fiery characters clash with Protestant-Catholic immigrant violence to depict the bloody violence that built up our nation. Joining DiCaprio for some steamy romance is his on-screen, pickpocket girlfriend played by Cameron Diaz.

DiCaprio will also star in Spielberg's latest movie, "Catch Me If You Can."  "Catch" is the true story of con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. who, during the 1960's, made millions by passing bad checks and posing as several different people, including a pilot, a physician and a teacher. Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent who eventually caught Abagnale. The film focuses on the father-son dilemma and adds a psychological undertone to the chase feel which will probably throw the audience in several different directions.

With these movies and many more to look forward to, don't complain about being bored this fall. There's going to be a steady income of new releases in theaters almost every Friday, so sit back, relax and watch your bottom grow as it adjusts to a theater chair.
