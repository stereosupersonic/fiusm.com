   I hear it all the time coming from the left and the right: Don't shove your ideas down peoples' throats.  In these cases its either the Right's comlaint of leftist policy or the Left's comlaint of the rightist.  Obviously, the debate seems without a resolution and one can easily be fooled that each side is inherently a polar opposite.  But this is not the entire story.

    For example, the newest debate, among many, over evolution in school is near an end, having focused on the battle over religion and secularism.  Yet, this generality shatters once one considers the facts.  Kitzmiller v. Dover School District is not a case of Good versus Evil, but rather a complicated dilemma concerning what was best for the students of Dover, Pennsylvania, the test of individual faith,  and the identity of one town.  The legal case can be summarized as whether Dover's high school biology classes should require an advisory to students of the current weakness of evolutionary theory.  Both sides of the case have made their final arguments and the public awaits the Judge's decision scheduled for January 2006.

    Certainly, this sensitive debate could have befallen almost any other town, a warning that indicates that concerned citizens with school children should pay close attention.  Hopefully, there is already some collective concern rather than isolated cynicism.  As a response to their concerns, Dover citizens recently decided to vote out eight of the nine school board members that voted for the specified class advisory.  Bernadette Reinking, one of the newly elected board members, said in an NPR interview that the vote was not an issue of religion (Dover happens to be a devout community by a large majority and Bernadette herself is christian), but rather an issue of maintaining the integrity of academics.  She suggested, as part of the new board agenda, to offer intelligent design and religious studies as elective courses to interested students.

    In light of these facts, and the results of the collective decision of this community, Dover seems to share a strong sense of identity with its members.  While Reinking admitted that she struggled with the power of her faith, the result of being targeted by some of her neighbors, I have a good feeling that any future debate, despite negative reactions from the likes of Pat Robertson, who condemned Dover's decision, will not phase this good town.

Headline: Road struggles continue for football with loss against UL
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Outplayed from the start, the Golden Panthers dropped their sixth contest of the season. 

Following their first ever win against a conference opponent last week in Monroe La., FIU continued its struggles on the road on a trip back to the same state. 

The Golden Panthers (2-6, 1-4 SBC) fell by three touchdowns, 28-7, to the host Rajun Cajuns of Louisiana-Lafayette (5-5, 4-2 SBC) Nov. 12.  

FIU, who traveled up to Louisiana the morning of the game because of a lack of hotels due to displaced Hurricane Katrina victims, was out-gained by 244 yards on the ground, thanks in part to stellar Cajun freshman Tyrell Fenroy. 

Head coach Don Strock made no excuses about the travel arrangements and blamed a poor start for the loss. 

"That we had to travel up here on the day of the game is no excuse," he said. "Other people have had to do it, too. That's a matter of being mentally and physically tough and being able to do it. "We always talk about starting games fast and not waiting. In this one, like so many times in the past when we waited until the second quarter, we had so many opportunities in the first half but just didn't cash in."

Fenroy, the first-year man, carried the ball 27 times for 147 yards, methodically picking apart the visitor defense. 

FIU was led offensively by tailback A'mod Ned and quarterback Josh Padrick, who for the second game in a row committed no turnovers. 

Ned managed just 73 yards on 15 carries, as the Golden Panthers were held to 226 yards of total offense. Padrick completed 18 of 34 passes for 162 yards and the lone FIU touchdown. 

"Louisiana-Lafayette put good pressure on the passer," Strock said. "But we did have some chances on passes down the field. Two of them were dropped and one was thrown behind, so the combination of those things isn't going to be good for you. But those are things we can work on."

 Lafayette set the tone from the start. They marched down the field, as they had on their first possession the last six weeks, and punched the ball into the end zone for an early lead. 

Led by starting quarterback Jerry Babb, who would later leave injured, and running back Fenroy, whose 26-yard run put the hosts on the Golden Panther six yard line, the Cajuns took a 7-0 lead. 

Babb kept the ball following the Fenroy carry and eased the ball into the end zone on first-and-goal from the six yard line. 

FIU had a chance to tie early in the second quarter. 

After driving the length of the field, the Golden Panthers faced a fourth-and-seven from the Cajun 22. Padrick found tight end Samuel Smith, but the play came up a yard short and Lafayette took over at their own 15. 

On the ensuing possession, all signs pointed to Louisiana-Lafayette extending their lead. After moving the ball deep into the red zone at the FIU five, backup quarterback Mic Desormeaux, who filled in for his injured teammate, pitched the ball which was fumbled and recovered by linebacker Lance Preston at the FIU 16. 

FIU's turnover woes would continue when, on fourth-and-nine from the Cajun 36-yard line, a bad snap during a Chris Patullo punt gave the hosts the ball at their own 45. 

Desormeaux proved that he belonged on the field, leading a 55-yard drive that culminated with a 14-point lead. 

Lafayette extended their lead as they once again used the quarterback keeper to get into the end zone, this time from 12 yards out. 

The Golden Panthers went into the locker room down two scores, knowing they could have generated more from Lafayette miscues. 

Their first drive of the second half was more of the same, as the swarming Cajun defense contained Padrick. Patullo pinned the hosts in their own zone on the ensuing punt, but opened the door for controversy.

After holding Lafayette in check, FIU was set to get the ball back at the UL 25-yard line following a short punt; however, a roughing-the-kicker penalty was called on defensive end Antwan Barnes, who appeared to have made his way to the ball cleanly. The Cajuns had new life with a new set of downs at their own 16. 

The controversial call gave way to a 14-play, 99-yard scoring drive by UL that ended with a Fenroy five-yard score and a 21-0 lead.

"The punt was tipped. It was a bad call," Strock said "I can't believe the referee didn't see that, the ball came out like a helicopter. 

"That changed the whole complexion of the game. We were going to get the ball back at the 25-yard line and hopefully get back in it. A touchdown would have made it 21-7, and then it's a different ball game."

 The Golden Panthers scored their only points of the night with 1:49 left to play in the third quarter. 

A seven-play, 67-yard drive ended with Padrick finding senior wide receiver Cory McKinney from 23-yards out. This brought the game within two scores. McKinney's reception set a new record for touchdown catches for any Golden Panther, marking the 20th of his career. 

With nothing to lose on their last drive of the game, FIU tried to convert a fourth-and-two from its own 12-yard line. After Padrick's pass attempt fell short, Lafayette scored its last points of the day as Derrick Smith ran the ball in from 12-yards out. 

The Golden Panthers end their first Division I-A season with three home games over the next three Saturdays. The rescheduled Homecoming game tops the list Nov. 19, against Western Kentucky, followed by match ups with Florida Atlantic Nov. 26 and Middle Tennessee Dec. 3.

Headline: GOLDEN PANTHER TIP OFF
Subheadline: Women's team begins season with new look 
Author:  Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For the first time since the 2000-2001 season, the women's basketball team will start the year without star forward Milena Tomova.  You may think that would be a cause for concern, but the Golden Panthers are geared up and ready for a new season with promising hopes.

"I think we're going to be very successful this year even though we lost Milena Tomova," said junior center Lasma Jekabsone. "I think we're going to be more together as a team."

The Golden Panthers are coming off a season where they fished with a solid 18-11 record and lost in the second round of the playoffs 61-60 to Louisiana-Lafayette.

"We have to have a higher level of sophistication than we had last year, we had a lot of heart and guts but we need to bring up our sophistication level," said head coach Cindy Russo.

Though the season ended abruptly, these players are confident on this year's outlook.

"I think [last year] we just had a lack of experience," said point guard Faeza Bouderra. "I think this year it's going to be better for us because we're a more mature team."

As the Golden Panthers try to cope with the loss of Tomova, they will look into the face of a schedule that features 14 Sun Belt Conference match-ups, and games against Kentucky and Miami.

"I'm really looking forward to playing against [Miami]," Bouderra said. "Last time we played them we lost by almost twenty points, so this time we really want to win."

It will be a new team with a new philosophy facing the Hurricanes Dec. 6.  The Golden Panthers will try to inherit an equal opportunity offense that will give way for more players to score, and avoid traps and double teams, as there will not be one focal player.

"What I think you're going to see is a more evenly passed around type of scoring," Russo said. "We definitely need to fill the gap of Milena."

As the team gets set to play their season opener, here's a position-by-position breakdown of the 2005-2006 women's basketball team.



Guards



This season, the Golden Panthers seem to have an array of talent at the guard position. Two focal points will be the leaders of the team: Faeza Bouderra and Eva Makela. Head coach Cindy Russo will look for these two not only for leadership, but for scoring. They will need to come up big if this team is going to advance to the deeper rounds of the playoffs.

"My role is going to increase from last year," Makela said. "I just want to play solid. I have to lead the team and score more."

On top of that, the Golden Panthers return a spark plug off the bench, sophomore LaQuetta Ferguson.

Ferguson came off the bench in 27 of the 29 games and averaged over 20 minutes with nearly ten points and four rebounds per game.

But the new face everybody's talking about is the freshman guard from Croatia, Iva Ciglar.

"I think Iva [is going to step up this year], she's going to help Faeza a lot," Jekabsone said. "She could bring intensity and is a good shooter.  She's also going to be very powerful and fast."

The guard position seems to have a lot of depth, speed and shooting that can contribute to up-tempo basketball. This is a spot the team seems to have no holes to fill.



Forwards



The forward position is led by returning juniors Gordana Bedalov and Asha Neal (who is naturally a shooting guard).

Neal started 28 of the team's 29 games last season and averaged 23 minutes and grabbed a career-high nine boards at Western Kentucky in the regularseason finale.

Bedalov - the 6'4" power-forward from Zagreb, Croatia - is the likely candidate to fill Tomova's place at forward.  

Although she only saw action in fourteen games last season, the team is looking forward to good things from Bedalov.

"I think Gordana is going to step up a lot this year and we're going to be really surprised on her performance," Bouderra said.

But the freshman forward coaches and players have their eye on this season is Miami-native Marquita Adley.

"I think you're going to see a lot of great things come out of Marquita Adley," Russo said.

The 6'0" power forward from Monsignor Pace High School brings a lot of needed size and a stacked resume to an otherwise small front court. Adley received all-state and first-team all county honors every year of high school and averaged 19 points and 18 rebounds as a senior.



Center



Lasma Jekabsone will lead the center position for the Golden Panthers, backed by junior Liene Bernsone.

Although Bernsone saw action in 20 games and started the first four of last year's regular season, it's going to be Jekabsone that will have to step up for this team to be successful.

"Lasma really stepped up for us last year and this year we're really going to count on her a lot," Bouderra said.

Russo added, "We need her to score more."

Jekabsone was plugged into the starting lineup last season against Elon University and never looked back. She came on strong and hoisted an average of eight points and nearly nine rebounds-per-game, while averaging over 29 minutes.

Lasma is very aware that the size they lose with the loss of Tomova will have to be made up with her presence in the paint. She will be a focal point in the offense, especially on the defensive side of the ball, as the women's basketball team will stick to playing man on man. However, all these expectations don't pull her away from what she wants to accomplish this season.

"I want to average a double-double every game," she said.

The Golden Panthers kick off their season Nov. 18 against Gardner-Webb at the Lancer Invitational. On Nov. 19, they will play host Longwood or Maryland-Eastern Shore.

Headline: Rouco's team hopes to earn national attention
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coach Sergio Rouco, in just his second year at the helm of the men's basketball team, has things heading in the right direction.

Following a 13-17 season last year that saw the team advance to the Sun Belt Conference semifinals, the Golden Panthers are getting recognition before this season even tips off.

With the return of senior Ivan Almonte, an all-Sun Belt First teamer last year, as well as his classmate Ismael N'Diaye, who led the Golden Panthers through many of their struggles last season, the team has been picked by the conference's coaches to finish second in a tough East Division of the conference. 

The Golden Panthers look like a changed team heading into a very tough out-of-conference schedule this year. Having finished last season with just eight players, they come into this new season with a roster of 13, including eight new faces. 

This season's squad, currently ranked 32 in the collegeinsider.com Mid-Major poll, will challenge for the East Division of the Sun Belt. They will travel to NCAA powers George Washington (Dec. 8), Notre Dame (Dec. 10) and  Michigan State (Dec. 18), in a toughest three-game stretch of the season before hosting the annual FIU Holiday Classic. The team won this tournament last year, on Dec. 27 and 28. Cal State Fullerton, St. Bonaventure and Texas-San Antonio will try and dethrone the Golden Panthers this season.  

"I'm not surprised [with the ranking],"  Rouco said. "We finished strong last season and that's why people believe we're going to be pretty good this year. 

"On the other hand, it is pretty surprising how quickly we've gained attention; I thought it would take us a bit longer, but we're up to the challenge. That's why I was hired and that's why we've put the together the schedule we did - to gain national recognition."



The Newcomers



With shooter Junior Matias and center Byron Burnett gone due to graduation, Kenny Simms and newcomer Johwen Villegas look to make an impact this season. 

Villegas, a transfer from Southeastern (Iowa) Community College, looks to be the piece that was missing in last year's puzzle. 

Touted as the much needed three point threat that eluded FIU teams in the past, the junior from Puerto Rico should immediately challenge for a starting spot in the back court. 

He will have to fight for his spot, as players like guard John Quintana, who transferred from St. Francis College (N.Y.) last December, will challenge for the spot vacated by Matias. 

Once eligible (Quintana must sit out until mid-December for transfer eligibility reasons), however, he could well become the third threat for the Golden Panthers if Villegas cannot fill the role. 

Also a threat from deep, Quintana comes in with experience. 

As a sophomore at St. Francis, he led the 15-13 team of coach Ron Ganulin's in scoring, averaging 15.2 points per game and was a member of the All-Northeast Conference team.  

Another battle to watch develop this season will be the fight for the point position. 

Senior Jayce Lewis, the incumbent, will have to compete for his starting spot with junior Alan Guyton, an injury red shirt last season following right knee surgery, and newcomer Elvis Lora, a freshman from New York. 

Elvis Lora could be the player to watch if he can crack into the starting lineup or gain valuable time on the court. 

He is a threat with his offensive skills,  often creating his own shots at both the point and off-guard positions. He was known for his scoring touch as a prep start in the Bronx. 

He adds to the list of players with a touch from behind the arc. This 2005-2006 team could be very dangerous from downtown.   

The addition of role players like forward Facundo Giorgio from Argentina and center Ismaila Njie from Gambia should provide Almonte with much needed help in the front court. 

Giorgio, a 6'8", 232 lbs. junior, is a big man with a good feel for the game around him, as well as a good shooter. He should see many minutes on the court in Rouco's system and could be what the Golden Panthers were missing last season when Almonte stepped off the court. 

If he can shoot the ball well, he could be the important sixth man as he can play a variety of positions in the front court. 



Center 



The starting center position, vacated with the departure of Burnett, is Kenny Simms' to lose. He will get competition from newcomer Njie, but Simms will be the man the Golden Panthers look for in the paint to grab both rebounds defensively and buckets offensively. 



Forwards



At power forward there is no doubt that Almonte will see the most time. Giorgio will come off the bench and supply the team with a scoring threat while Almonte is not on the floor as well as help out defensively, though no where near at the intensity of the starter. 

At small forward there is also little doubt as to who will play the most minutes. Second in scoring last season, N'Diaye will see the most court time and his presence is necessary, like Almonte's, for this team to be successful. 



Guards 



The off guard position will be interesting in how it develops. Cesar Chavez-Jacobo is a returning player, with much improvement in his play in the position last season. 

He will have to compete for the job with Villegas, and it could be an uphill climb if the newcomer can find his way in the system early. Look for more competition once Quintana gains his eligibility. 

The fight will probably come down to the two new guys, with Villegas as the one that could really make an impact this season. 

As mentioned earlier, the point guard spot is still up in the air.

Lewis should be the one to start early in the year, but improved play from both Guyton and Lora could see him a role off the bench. Walk on freshman Joey Cantens is also a threat from the three-point range, but may not play a role in the starting tussle between his three teammates. 

Look for Lora to make a statement and prove that he is the point man of the future at FIU. 

Many questions must still be answered following FIU's lone preseason game, a 72-69 win over Division III St. Mary's College of Maryland.  

The Golden Panthers showed that they have not played many minutes together, struggling to get things going despite playing solid defense at times. 

If this team can stay healthy, gel together early and gain the confidence  lacked last season, they could compete for the conference's bid into the NCAA tournament.

Headline: Medical school will bring prestige to FIU
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Acquiring a medical school has become the trend here in South Florida. In the past few years alone, three of South Florida's universities have proposed the establishment of medical programs: Florida Atlantic University (through the University of Miami), the University of Central Florida and FIU.

The question for FIU is not whether we need a medical program, because the answer to that is inevitably yes, but rather, how long will it take?

   There are definitely benefits to having a medical program at the university.  If a medical school is instated at FIU, it will become the first public school of medicine in South Florida.  It will bring the university prestige and recognition, which is something it can never have enough of. FIU has made insurmountable progress through the years, but is in definite need of increasing the schools of study. The fact that many of the highest-ranking universities in the nation not only have medical programs, but excellent ones at that, is another reason why FIU should pursue one.

Elizabeth Ricardo, who's majoring in political science, believes that a medical program is necessary here at FIU for more than one reason. 

"Especially considering that we are establishing a law school, we should continue our progression by establishing a medical program. It will add a lot because it will give a lot of students the opportunity to get into those programs," she said.

 At the moment, the University of Miami's Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine is the only fully functional medical school in South Florida, and in April 2005, Florida Atlantic University became part of its prestige through the opening of the University of Miami School of Medicine (UMSM) distant site campus at FAU.

As of right now, there are only three respected medical schools in the state of Florida: UM, the University of Florida and the University of South Florida, to which the acclaim is increasing as South Florida steadily looks for new doctors.  FIU needs to become a part of that selection availability.

Recently, one of FIU's supporters made one of the largest donations to the school in the effort to assist the medical program.

Member of the FIU Board of Trustees Herbert A. Wertheim made a $10 million pledge to the advancement of FIU's hopeful school of medicine.  FIU is currently looking for additional funding in order to hasten the process of establishing the medical program. Plans will not be put into action for at least another year, but FIU is hoping to raise more money in order to receive equal contribution from the state.

Quite frankly, who knows how long this might take?  With UM a few short miles from us, with an already established medical program, the state will surely consider that in its deliberation and be skeptical to approve the funding. The argument being: Why invest more money when we know that a program just a few miles away is thriving? Advancement is the reason - for not only the university, but also for South Florida.

 International Relations major Providence Okoye, believes that one is necessary at FIU. 

"Most top universities have medical schools." Okoye said,  "In South Florida, there will be a shortage of doctors because most people who graduate from medical school stay where they do their residency." 

Historically, Ivy League universities were founded on the principle of giving their students the most elite education known to man, and for that reason, it was ethically impossible to exclude such a necessity as a medical program from their curriculum of study.  So, if it is necessary for an Ivy League university to offer a medical program, why should it not then be necessary for FIU, in our effort of becoming an influential university as well, to pursue one?

Medical programs across the country are becoming increasingly difficult to enter, and by having a program with high standards, you are automatically raising the standard of the university as a whole. FIU's prospective medical school has already posted its requirements of a 1300 SAT or 29 ACT score and a 3.7 unweighted GPA for high school seniors. 

If a high number of students are admitted into the program, that will undoubtedly influence the overall statistics of the university, which FIU would not mind.

"It will increase the recognition, considering that the only notable medical school in Miami is UM and it's so expensive, having a medical school at FIU will be an asset to the community and school itself," Ricardo said.

Many people argue that FIU is trying to establish too many programs concurrently; the School of Nursing was just moved and given more funding and there is a new law building in progress.  But the fact is that these are signs of progress. Maybe too hastily, but nonetheless it is showing that FIU is not trying to be complacent with its standing, but rather trying to become established among higher ranked universities. Each university has something to offer; FIU is trying to offer it all.

Headline: Volleyball victory secures spot in conference tournament
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Three seniors left their mark Nov. 6, as the women's volleyball team defeated conference foe Arkansas-Little Rock in straight sets at Pharmed Arena.

The victory -- coming only 43 hours after a thrilling 3-2 victory over Arkansas State, which saw FIU trail 2-0 at one point - secures the team a spot in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament and also marks the final regular season home match for seniors Carolina Cano, Laura Vogel and Anna Dmowska.

"All week we were talking about finishing the season on a high note," said first-year head coach Danijela Tomic, "especially for the three seniors."

The Golden Panthers improve their record to 15-12 (5-6 SBC), while the Trojans drop to 17-11 (8-5 SBC).

"I think we're just more excited and realize that we can beat these better teams," Vogel said. "It motives us to play how we know how to play: To win, to be aggressive and to complete our plays."

The victory also holds personal for Tomic, who played for UALR from 1995-1997, and was the first foreign-born athlete to play volleyball for them. She was also an assistant for the Trojans for six seasons after her playing career.

"A win is a win," Tomic said. "When I line up my team against another team, I don't care who's on the other side, [but] I'm very happy. It's a sweet win and that's all I can say."

Vogel and Dmowksa recorded 12 and 15 kills, respectively, while Cano recorded seven digs.

Sophomore Anita Szymanska added another 14 kills and sophomore Dyionna Smith recorded a match-high 14 digs. Smith's performance, along with her 18 digs against Arkansas State, earned her Sun Belt Conference Defensive Player of the Week.

Game one saw ten tie scores, but only two lead changes. After battling for the lead early on, the Golden Panthers broke an 11-11 tie off seven straight points, six of which came off the service of freshman Mariana Drumeva. After a 25-25 tie, FIU scored five of the final seven points to take the game 30-27.

Game two saw FIU trail by as much as six early on, but eventually tying at 20. The game went on to include 12 ties, until FIU scored two consecutive points off the service of Drumeva - including a service ace - to win 34-32.

In game three's 30-26 victory, FIU never trailed. They did, however, suffer a minor scare. With FIU leading 29-22, Trojan Iva Adzic recorded four straight points - including three straight service aces - until Vogel ended the match with a kill. 

"It's so hard to say good bye to home court," an emotional Dmowska said. "It's the second time in my life I've had to do it and practicing it doesn't make it easier." 

The Golden Panthers head into the conference tournament as the No. 6 seed and will face off against No. 3 seed Denver Nov. 17.

The tournament, hosted by Middle Tennessee State, will be held Nov. 17-19 in Murfreesboro, Tenn.

"We want to carry the momentum into the tournament," Tomic said. "The confidence we got from these two wins is huge."

Cano added, "We played so together this weekend, that I hope it can transfer to the conference tournament."

Headline: Hurricane damages cost FIU millions
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
After assessing the damages done by Hurricane Wilma,  it will cost the university an estimated $7 million for repairs at  University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus.

"50 percent of the damage occurred at the Engineering Center," said Jose Rodriguez, director of facilities construction.

The Engineering Center suffered major roofing problems. 

According to James Wassenaar, the director for the Office of Student Affairs, Auxiliaries and Operations, money for roofing and window repairs, costing between $4,000 and $5,000 for campus housing, is coming from housing reserve funds. 

State funding and aid from Florida Emergency Management Agency will cover other campus damage. The university is still holding meetings with FEMA to discuss how much money they grant to the university. 

Currently, the university does not know how much money it will receive or when all the repairs will be complete.

Lifeguard runs over sunbather 

A Miami Beach lifeguard driving a 3,400-pound truck on Nov. 13 in South Pointe Park allegedly ran over a sunbather. 

The truck ran over the victim's shoulder and nearly missed her head. Seconds before the truck ran her head, the sunbather let out a scream for the lifeguard to stop the truck. 

19-year-old Jillian Gonzalez, was sent to Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was released the same day of the incident.

The father of the sunbather, Ernie Gonzalez, is glad that his daughter is safe, but he did not provide details on his daughter's injuries. 

''By the grace of God she is at home tonight instead of in a funeral home,'' Gonzalez said.

After Hurricane Wilma, city officials gave lifeguards temporary permission to use trucks instead of the lifeguard stands, which are damaged from the storm.

Lifeguard Orlando Artiz has received criticism twice from his supervisors on his carelessness with ocean rescue equipment.

Headline: Law school offers students advice
Author: Fernando Anzoategui / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This year's school of law open house was held Nov. 12 at the Biscayne Bay Campus Wolfe University Center. 

Among the guests were Ediberto Roman, associate dean and Michelle D. Mason, associate dean of admissions. 

These staff members took the spotlight and spoke to potential students and parents who attended.

They went though the complicated and lengthy process of applying to FIU's School of Law. 

According to Roman, there are several factors that the admissions office looks for in an applicant.

"There are four factors in the application process; number one: letter of reference, number two: GPA, number three: [your] personal statement and fourth: your LSAT score," Roman said. 

He then continued to stress how important Law School Admitance Test scores are to the university, and offered advice for obtaining the best possible score. 

"Consider taking a prep course if you scored lower than a 148 on your LSAT," Roman said. 

The LSAT is a 101 question, tightly timed multiple-choice test with a 30-minute essay. 

"This test is tightly timed so that the average student has difficulties answering every single question in the exam," according to the 2004 Princeton Review "Cracking the LSAT". 

Each section is 35 minutes long and there are five sections. 

The LSAT test is scored on a scale ranging from 120 to 180. 

The 2005 entering class had an average of 3.3 GPA and an LSAT score average of 155. 

Currently, the university is in the midst of building a $32 million facility for law students and faculty.

Although the law school is under a provisional accreditation, students can still take the Florida Bar Exam to become an attorney.

Mason also offered tips for students who are considering attending the school next Fall. 

"May 1 is our deadline for Fall applicants, you need two letters of recommendation from professors," Mason said.

In March of 2006, the American Bar Association will grant full accreditation to FIU's law school, according to both Mason and Roman. 

"The school is very serious about getting the A.B.A. accreditation. All professors are exceptional and approachable," said Edwin Cruz, second-year law student. 

Among the crowd of students was Olga Alvarez, who will become the first attorney in the Alvarez family if she can manage to overcome her fear of the LSAT. 

"Five months ago, I decided to take the step to apply to FIU. I would be the first person in my family to be an attorney," Alvarez said. 

Roman assured all the students and parents not to worry, and concluded the event by promoting the law school staff's desire to help students.

"Come visit us or contact the admissions office, we have an open- door policy." 

Roman also predicted a bright future for the FIU law school.

"In 20 years from now, I fully expect that FIU will be a top notch State Law School, and not just state, but at a national level as well," Roman said.

Headline: Homecoming continues after cancellation
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Despite the disruption and postponement of Homecoming Week due to Hurricane Wilma, Homecoming was quickly rescheduled, mostly intact, and with little financial losses incurred.

"Wilma really didn't set us back at all," said Homecoming director Brian Swensen. 

The Homecoming Programming Council had planned a variety of daily events as part of Homecoming Week.  

"Every single event was postponed, minus the ones scheduled prior to Homecoming Week," said Swensen.  

Nearly all Homecoming events were rescheduled for this week. Three Student Government Association events were cancelled: The FIU Trivia Show, Lawn Decorating and the Homecoming Court Showcase because a venue was not found.  Additionally, a new date for Canned Castles, a canned food drive on behalf of Hurricane Katrina victims, has not been determined at this time.

"We also wanted to shorten the week a little bit, because people just want to get on with school," said Swensen.

However, according to Swensen, none of the money spent on setting up and organizing these events was lost.

"We were fortunate where all of our contracts stipulated that they'd be either reset or cancelled by an act of God, and an act of God took place in the form of Wilma," Swensen said.

Student Programing Council, for its part, was forced to cancel Dinner & a Movie, which was scheduled for Nov. 9. 

A party with a Blackout Theme was also planned, but it too was cancelled.  

"We hadn't finalized it yet, so it was okay to cancel that," said Tatiana Regueiro, Hospitality Cabinet Member of the Special Events Committee.  

SPC had also booked musical group Hanson to come to FIU Oct. 23 for a meet-and-greet and to perform a couple of songs, but Hurricane Wilma forced them to cancel. However, Hanson had agreed to appear for free, so no money was lost.

"Basically, the hurricane just messed up our communications, so we were unable to plan things and keep the things we had planned already," said Nicole Singh, a member of the SPC Special Events Committee. "We were just very uncertain about whether people were going to be able to attend or not."

In addition to the Hanson concert, several movies sponsored by SPC were postponed or cancelled.

 "I have no dates to put them, and I was too late to cancel them because they were shipped before the hurricane," said Sophia Del Zoppo, Films Chair for the SPC.  

Del Zoppo also said that she was unable to receive a refund for the movies because "after it's been sent, it's out of their hands, according to the Film Companies."

Originally, the SPC Films Committee had planned to screen Fantastic Four for the Drive-In Movie as part of Homecoming, but the movie was replaced by Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith.  Del Zoppo had no room in the schedule to bring back Fantastic Four. Sith was screened Nov. 15 at the Housing Quad.

Headline: Fiji haunted house scares, thrills visitors
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Social fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta's third annual haunted house graced the University Park campus several weeks after Halloween, due to hurricane Wilma's impact. Originally set for Oct. 27 and 29, the haunted house had to be postponed to Nov. 12, because of the lack of power in Miami-Dade County. 

David Quiñones, a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI), was in charge of the house's construction and interior design. When news of the impending hurricane reached Quiñones and his fellow fraternity brothers, the fraternity considered the haunted house's future.

 "We thought about canceling the event, but we decided to postpone it because people didn't really get to do much for Halloween. Because the hurricane kept many people indoors for the holiday, the haunted house gave people the opportunity to still experience the holiday," Quiñones said.

The event, entitled Halloween Haunted House 3: Home Sweet Hell, provided visitors with a glimpse of famous homes featured in both modern and classic horror films. Each room and corridor in the FIJI house was sectioned off and decorated meticulously to depict a certain movie. Seven horror movies were represented throughout the house: The Grudge, 13 Ghosts, House of Wax, House on Haunted Hill, Psycho, The Amityville Horror and Poltergeist. 

To accommodate various age groups, the haunted house's hours of operation were divided into two sessions. Aimed primarily for children, the first session was from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The kids received small bags filled with various goodies and the house's scares were toned down accordingly. In addition to getting goodie bags, kids were able to play around in the bounce house located outside of the fraternity house.

The older crowds got to experience the haunted house between the hours of 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. During this session, the scares were out in full force. Visitors entered the house in groups of six to eight and were led by an eerie looking tour guide.

"We only let six to eight people into the house at a time so everything could stay organized," Quiñones said. "Also, small groups were ideal because then the scares wouldn't be used up solely on the people in the front." 

As visitors progressed through the house, spooky noises and dim lighting intensified the already frightening environment. Also, the constant flashing of lights and the ominous feel of the rooms sent shivers down people's spines. 

"Walking through the house was a pretty creepy experience. Everything was pretty well-done, especially the lighting and background noises. All that stuff really added to the whole experience," said sophomore Jorge Valens.

Another one of the haunted house's guests shared similar sentiments. 

"I'm not a big fan of haunted stuff, but the decorations were really neat," said sophomore Teresa Ronquillo." Everyone seemed to be really enjoying themselves." 

Out of all the sections in the haunted house, the second floor corridor produced the most shrieks and screams. Designed around the movie 13 Ghosts, the doorways of each room on the second floor revealed a particular ghost from the film. Guests crept past each doorway and were greeted by a haunting figure. Meanwhile, bodies were strewn across the floor and some of them reached out to grab at onlookers. People jumped and yelped as they were constantly hounded by both the apparitions and the bodies.

Overall, the event was a success. Nonetheless, Quiñones saw room for improvement. 

"Instead of making the event mainly a Phi Gamma Delta event, in the future, we hope to get more of FIU involved and encourage departments like Campus Life to help make a great event even better," he said.

Headline: My First Time
Subheadline: Heat experience worth the effort
Author: Michelle Santisteban / Life Editor
&nbsp;
I did not know what I would experience my first time. I was nervous, yet excited. Everyone says it's amazing and that once you do it, you're going to want to do it all the time. I'm talking about my first Miami Heat game, of course. 

To all the girls with sport crazed boyfriends: I know what it's like. All my life I've never liked sports and always said I would never be with someone who did, but destiny proved otherwise.

About five months ago, I got what was coming - the guy I started dating is a huge sports fan. I figured, since I loved everything else about him so this should not be a problem. 

However, I started to realize that he watched every single Miami Dolphin and Heat game. I had heard countless girls whine and complain about their boyfriends cheating on them, except it wasn't with a girl, but with their favorite sport. 

So, instead of joining the flock and complaining, I decided that if you can't beat them, join them. It was time that I put aside all the preconceived notions I had about sports and see what the big deal was all about.  

On Nov. 12, I attended the Heat vs. Bobcats game with my one and only. Even though we sat up high (the lower bowl seats were sold out) the view of the court was impressive. 

A pair of hotdogs, popcorn and a coke later, the player introduction began.

The lights shut off and before I knew it, fire came flaming out of the corners of the court and Phil Collins's "In the Air Tonight" started to play. Dwayne Wade, Alonzo Mourning and Antoine Walker came out looking prepared and ready to win. 

The Heat started off good and I started to feel something weird - was it joy? What was happening? Every time the Heat scored, I found myself clapping and hoping for another three pointer or dunk. 

I actually cared whether they played well or not. Despite Shaquille O'Neal being on the disabled list (injured players), I enjoyed watching the heart and desire of Mourning -  who replaced him. Wade was rocking the court, dunking over people and often falling on the court, the same way Converse portrays him in their shoe commercials.

I caught my boyfriend looking at me and I could tell he was excited to see me enjoying myself.

Halftime was approaching and I was looking forward to some amazing nachos and those legendary lemonades that are also offered at carnivals. We took the food back to our seats and devoured all of it. What is good sport fun without fattening goodness? 

The game started again and we were winning by a huge margin. I was really getting into it and could not believe I was developing an emotional attachment to these players I knew nothing about.  

It was now the fourth quarter and there were six minutes and 22 seconds left in the game. We still had a big lead. Heat coach Stan Van Gundy decided to put Dorrel Wright in the game, a 19-year-old player who made the NBA straight out of high school. I could not believe that someone my age was on this nationwide known team. I enjoyed watching him play; I felt a certain level of equality between us. 

However, with Van Gundy giving all the young players a chance to play, the Bobcats started to make a comeback and I started to get nervous. Could they actually win after they were getting a beat down by the Heat? So, the Heat changed up the players again and brought in the big dogs to save the night. 

The Heat won 108-99. I was happy they won, otherwise my jersey would have been bad luck and I would never be able to wear it again. Yes, I bought a Wade jersey and became superstitious like many sport fans.

Basketball, football and baseball are all an escape from reality - a way to step out of the complicated and hard world we live in. I never noticed that until my first time.

I really had a great time and what makes it fun is the entire experience: The pre-show, Burnie the mascot, the dancers, the game and even the nachos. Life is too short to be uptight and not give things a chance. 

Try new things, you just might find yourself in my shoes: Having a good time and building a stronger relationship.
