Headline: CAN'T BEAT THE HEAT
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Fifteen strong.

That's what Miami Heat head coach Pat Riley preached throughout the playoffs and what the world got to watch.

That's one of the reasons this Heat team was able to win four straight games over Dallas after losing the first two, and the reason the Heat are world champions today.

Eleven years after promising a championship parade, Riley finally was able to deliver it last Friday.

Despite the current joy and glory, there have been a lot of painful times for Riley and the Heat franchise. 

The first came in 1996 when the NBA  cited the Heat with salary-cap circumvention and rejected the offseason acquisition of free-agent forward Juwan Howard, supposedly to be the missing link to a championship team.

Then in 1997, what was the best Heat squad ever at the time, lost to Michael Jordan and the Bulls without even putting up a fight.

In 1998, the Heat lost in the first round of the playoffs to New York despite being Atlantic Division champs.

The following year, Allan Houston's leaning jump shot from the foul line lifted the Knicks to a 78-77 victory with .8 of a second left in what may be the single most demoralizing defeat in Heat history.

In 2000, softy Jamal Mashburn passed up the winning shot to Clarence Weatherspoon ending the season to the Knicks for the third year in a row.

This same year, Heat center Alonzo Mourning was diagnosed with a kidney disorder, causing the two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year to retire.

Finally, last year the Heat lost to Detroit in the Eastern Conference Finals despite leading with 1:38 left in the decisive Game 7.

All the disappointments and heartaches are finally erased. 

This Heat team, consisting of players that were considered cancers such as Antoine Walker, Jason Williams and James Posey, was able to accomplish what only five teams have been able to do in the last 20 years: win a championship. 

"It was our time," Riley said in the postgame interview following the 95-92 win over Dallas in Game 6. "I really believe it was our time."

Not only was it the Heat's time but it's about time. The fans, coaches and players of this city have suffered enough.

What makes this Heat team special is that every game someone different delivered big minutes besides Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal.

Whether it was 37-year-old Gary Payton hitting big baskets, Posey taking offensive charges, Mourning blocking shots or Udonis Haslem playing great defense, this Heat team was composed of a great supporting cast.

Riley, who won his seventh championship ring but first in 18 years, looks like a genius after being criticized for trading Eddie Jones and not resigning Damon Jones.

Besides having the ridiculous talents of Wade, Riley was the difference that made the Heat champions today, not Dallas.

His experience and motivational skills kept the team hungry. I doubt that the Heat would have won the championship if Stan Van Gundy had remained as head coach.

No longer will Miami be known as a good team that has never won a championship. The Heat are the world champions and no one can take that away from them.

Well, at least for a year.

Headline: Women's tennis team repeats as Sun Belt champions
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Alabama in April is not a vacation hotspot. Yet, as their classmates set off on a semester break, the eight ladies of FIU's tennis team set their sights on Mobile. They were all smiles upon returning home.

"We're the best team in the school," said junior Shilla D'Armas.

There's no arguing with that.

The Golden Panthers routed Denver 4-1 on April 23 to successfully defend its Sun Belt Championship - the only conference title for the FIU athletic program in 2005-2006.

"Not many teams are able to do that," said junior Nikkita Fountain. "We had the same team so we were able to keep the trend going and win it two years in a row. It was great."

Just like in 2005, the Golden Panthers didn't stop there.

FIU defeated Iowa 4-1 in the first round of the NCAA Championships May 12 before falling to eventual runner-up Miami one day later.

Finishing 2006 with a 21-6 record and a No. 35 national ranking, the ladies were thrilled with their results.

 "We had a really good season, I have to say," said sophomore Marijana Cutuk . "At the beginning some injuries occurred. It was tough but we struggled through."

Those injuries came hot and heavy as the Golden Panthers started their 2006 campaign, forcing three-time Sun Belt Coach of the Year Ronni Bernstein into some creative lineup changes. 

Desanka Jovanovic dislocated her right shoulder before the team's opener against Jacksonville and singles star Egle Petrauskaite sprained her right ankle soon thereafter, leaving seniors Bruna Discordia and Courtney Jonson to fill the void. 

Best friends off the court, Discordia and Jonson ran off 10 straight doubles victories in March. Jonson also shined in singles, despite having only played three singles matches in 2005. The fiery Australian finished her FIU career with a 13-4 singles mark in her senior season.

"We have good depth within the team so you've gotta always be ready to step up and play," Jonson said as FIU prepared to take on the Hawkeyes. "There's injuries and if someone's not feeling good, you could get told you're playing so you've just gotta be ready. We all train hard; we all can play."

FIU's superior depth was evident when Petrauskaite and Jovanovic returned to the court. Petrauskaite earned All-Sun Belt Conference honors, despite spending two weeks on crutches. Playing predominately out of the No. 2 singles position, the sophomore posted a 16-3 record and clinched the team's victory against Iowa in the NCAAs with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Hillary Mintz.

 "I wasn't expecting to play so well," Petrauskaite said. "I got through some tough matches at the beginning of the season and then I just got in a groove."

For Jovanovic, the road to recovery was much more difficult. Told by doctors that she would miss her entire senior season, Jovanovic was scheduled for surgery to repair her right shoulder on March 20. But she defied the odds eight days before the operation by defeating Sara Giles of North Texas 6-2, 6-3. Jovanovic postponed the surgery until August and played the remainder of the season.

"The first few matches were so weird," she said. "I hadn't played for a month and then I had to be back on the court and I couldn't even serve... It was so hard for me, more mentally than physically. After two or three matches, I was fine."

Jovanovic went 14-1 in 2006. Compensating for her serve with speedy court coverage, Jovanovic played a major role in FIU's second straight Sun Belt title. She earned a point for FIU in each round of the tournament, sweeping past North Texas Aziza Aba Butain, Troy's Suzanne Jones and Denver's Lorinda Boothman without losing a set.

"I just go on the court and try to forget," Jovanovic said after the Sun Belt tournament. "It's hard because it keeps on bothering me. But when I'm on the court, I'm on the court. I don't think about [the injury] and I just want to win. I try to do it quick and get out of there.

"I'm happy I made it."

Juniors Paula Zabala and Fountain came together to make doubles history for FIU. With a 22-5 record, Zabala and Fountain finished the season ranked 23rd nationally - defeating No. 11 Gabriela Duch and Neyssa Etienne of South Florida and No. 17 Merve Asimgil and Sylvia Kosakowski of Pepperdine along the way.

"We started playing last year and we both connect pretty good on the court,"  said Zabala, who also went 18-7 out of the No. 1 singles spot. "She has good serves and I complement with the volleys and poaching so we make a good connection."

Zabala now owns the all-time FIU record for career doubles victories with 60. She and Fountain were named to the All-SBC team and are looking forward to a successful senior season together.

"It's always good after you work so hard to get some kind of recognition for all the hours that you put in," said Fountain. "We played unbelievable this season. Hopefully we'll keep it going."

Speaking of unbelievable, one Golden Panther will be riding some major momentum into 2007. 

Cutuk started 2006 modestly, winning three of her first five matches. 

Little did anyone know that her win over Alabama-Birmingham's Samrin Tanzeem on Feb. 25 was the start of something special.

From that day on, Cutuk didn't lose a match. She reeled off 19 consecutive victories, winning 11 6-0 bagel sets along the way. Her win over Kyla Iwinski of Denver clinched the Sun Belt title for FIU.

"I saw Egle was playing next to me and she was struggling to finish and we were kind of close," said Cutuk about her championship triumph. "Either one of us, we had to finish. It was a big relief when I was done... Although I was so tired, I made a good sprint to the net."

So how does a player go from 3-2 start and finish 22-2?

"Nothing changed," Cutuk said. "I'm very consistent. It's hard to beat me. I will run for every ball. If I need to be there three hours, I will be there to win. So that's the deal."

Cutuk will look to extend her winning streak next season and hopes that the tennis team's success generates a larger fan base.

"We need more attention and more people coming," she said. "I'm satisfied with the way things are now; I'm just hoping that it's going to be better."

Headline: FIFA World Cup full of surprises, disappointments
Author: Reuben Pereira / Assistant News Director
&nbsp;
Students, faculty members and staff sit and stand around flat screen television sets all over campus - their faces glued to what's happening on screen. 

The same can be said about people from New York to Bombay. They're strangers, but for four weeks they join in celebrating the world's largest sporting event. 

No, not the NBA Finals, nor the Olympics. It's the FIFA World Cup - arguably, the most prestigious prize in world sport. 

Every four years, for over a month, the world's best soccer nations battle it out while an estimated 2.8 billion people cheer, kicking and screaming for their favorite teams. The 18th FIFA World Cup currently taking place in Germany will conclude July 9 when an estimated 1.1 billion people will watch as the final two teams play for the title of World Champions.

Every World Cup has its share of surprises, shocking upsets, and breakout stars. Germany 2006 isn't an exception. The group stage has offered highly entertaining matches. 

The biggest upset of the tournament thus far would have to be Ghana's 2-0 victory over the highly favored Czech Republic. The victory over the world number two wasn't as big as the Senegalese victory over France, then the reigning world champions, in the 2002 World Cup, but was enough to send the Czechs crashing out and give the Ghanaians a spot in the second round. 

FIFA, soccer's governing body, has recognized the increasing talent of African nations and awarded South Africa hosting duties for the 2010 World Cup, which will be the first time the championships will be held in Africa.

Besides the Czechs, other teams that disappointed were the Serbia and Montenegro team, which conceded 10 goals in three games after conceding only one goal in their qualifying run, and the United States, which failed to win a single game after being prematurely over hyped by the American media. Croatia, Japan and Poland also took the early flight home.

Going into the tournament, the defending champions Brazil were considered the overwhelming favorites to retake the cup. However, after an incredible display of skill and teamwork including a 6-0 rout of Serbia and Montenegro, the tables seem to have tipped in favor of the Argentineans. 

Spearheaded by Hernán Crespo, Javier Saviola and Juan Román Riquelme, the Argentineans face Mexico in the Round of 16 before a possible matchup with hosts Germany. The mighty South Americans were only halted in their tracks by a superb Holland team in what many considered to be a preview of the final. 

The Dutch, although not as impressive as the Argentineans, led by Arjen Robben, are considered dark horses to win the cup. They face Group D winners Portugal, led by Luis Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo, in the Round of 16. It should be noted that the Dutch haven't beaten the Portuguese in their last seven match ups, but this is soccer and anything is possible.

No one should underestimate the hosts and losing finalists of the 2002 World Cup - Germany. The Germans, coached by German soccer legend Jürgen Klinsmann, and led by Michael Ballack and current tournament top scorer Miroslav Klose breezed through the first round winning all their matches (last time they did so was in 1974 when they won it all.) and face Sweden in the second round. 

The other soccer powerhouses shouldn't be forgotten. England, led by David Beckham, started their campaign unimpressively but improved in the match against Sweden only to lose striker Michael Owen due to a knee injury which rules him out for the rest of the tournament. However, the quick recovery of rising star Wayne Rooney with support from Beckham and company should see them through to a possible match up with the Dutch in the quarter finals, provided they get past underdog Ecuador.

Perennial under-achievers Spain have got off to their best start in years and the always popular Italians thoroughly outplayed the Czechs, the Americans and the Ghanaians to top the "Group of Death". 

The Italians face a young, exciting Australian team in the second round. France, on the other hand, are struggling and have struggled ever since winning the world cup at home in 1998. 

That brings us to Brazil. After an underwhelming start, the Brazilians showed the world why they are world champions and still the best team in the world when they drubbed Japan 4-1 after trailing 1-0 just before the half. 

A world class performance from FIFA World Player of the Year Ronaldinho and two goals from the All-time World Cup scorer, Ronaldo, was a slap in the face to critics who doubted him. 

With the world cup at the half way point, we've seen many entertaining and thrilling games, fantastic goals and a lot of strong teams, it's pretty clear that the best is yet to come.

Look for part two next week: Students and faculty opinions on the tournament and predictions on who will win the World Cup.

Subheadline: Maidique's raise deemed excessive
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
President Modesto Maidique has had a successful year. The State Board of Governors approved the medical school that he describes as the "top professional achievement of [his] professional life." 

This and other accomplishments will not go without financial compensation. 

On June 14, the University Board of Trustees approved a new three-year contract that includes a hefty raise - hefty enough to prompt some debate regarding its suitability.

The terms of Maidique's new contract allows for an increase of a little over 20 percent in his base salary. This alone might seem like an exaggeration: Within the context of a six-figure salary, a 20 percent increase makes for an extra $60,000 a year.  This is more than the annual salary of the president of the United States.

The trustees have agreed to match up to 20 percent of his base salary, or about $77,000, from the FIU Foundation's private funds. 

In addition, Maidique will be eligible for a performance bonus of $50,000 or more, 70 percent of which will be conditional upon the completion of mutually established annual goals and 30 that will be left to the "discretion of the board." 

Altogether the bonus, supplement and base salary creep over the $500,000 mark.  That is upward of half a million dollars - annually. 

Added to this is a rambling list of perks, out of which we can extract the following sampler: a $9,000 car stipend; a $5,000 medical check-up stipend, to cover medical expenses not covered by the University insurance; and even a $10,000 legal stipend to cover the expenses of negotiating this contract in the first place. 

The icing on the cake however, is the sabbatical clause. Upon completing the three years of his contract, Maidique will be eligible for a one-year sabbatical, during which he will receive the same salary while he has the opportunity to devote his time to activities such as research, writing and community service. 

Granted, Maidique has done a solid job. During his tenure, FIU has acquired a law school, a medical school and a football program, as well as doubled the amount of students enrolled. That, and he has been around for 20 years. With the experience and seniority he has acquired, he may arguably deserve substantial compensation. 

The package included in  Maidique's new contract, however, goes well beyond appropriate remuneration and enters the territory of excessive lavishness. 

The sum of his compensation package puts him at the top of the best-paid public university presidents in the nation. His new salary will make Maidique the next-best paid public university president in Florida, second only to University of Florida's Bernie Machen.

Moreover, a large portion of this package will be taken out of the FIU Foundation's funds. These funds come from donors, who share their money with the expectation that it will be destined toward improving the University, rather than improving its president's quality of life. 

 The raise seems excessive for the president of a public institution. Maidique's pay raise is especially troubling in consideration of the unflattering events have transpired this past year and sullied the president's image. 

Take, for example, the incident in which two faculty members, who were also close friends of Maidique, were arrested for allegedly being unregistered Cuban agents and charged with passing information to the Cuban government. Not only did the University receive bad press, but the fact that Maidique knew the suspects personally led some to believe that Maidique knew about it all along. 

The Miami Herald also published a detailed article exposing Maidique's excessive travel expenses - think private jet charters, luxury hotel suites and three-day limousine rides - that were paid in full by the University. 

If the amount of Maidique's new salary seems inordinate for any public university president, that same figure is exorbitant for one who is surrounded by such dubious circumstances. 

Those who defend the president's raise claim that the pressure and intensity of his position are comparable to those of a corporate CEO, so his salary should be comparable to that. However, FIU is not a corporation; it is a university - and a public one at that.

Headline: Potential Energy
Subheadline: Energy independence even more elusive than originally thought
Author: Christopher Necuze / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
As gas prices continue to rise at unprecedented rates, all the focus seems to be on the promise of alternative fuel sources. The creators of these relatively new technologies are making bold promises, saying that these new energy sources are the future and claiming that they will end this country's crippling dependency on foreign oil. 

These technologies, ladies and gentlemen, are very real. Both have been successfully tested and have proven that they work. 

Don't, however, claim victory just yet. There are some problems with these new technologies. Unless we are able to find solutions for them, the dream of the United States of decreasing or eliminating dependence on foreign oil imports may, after all, remain just that: a dream.


Hydrogen

When most people think about alternative sources of energy, the first thing that usually comes to mind is hydrogen. At a glance, hydrogen fuel seems like a quick fix for all our energy needs. 

Hydrogen is relatively easy to find (being the most abundant element in the universe usually comes with that perk) and is a clean source of energy. Driving a hydrogen vehicle is just about as harmful to the environment as watering your lawn.

Before you break out the bubbly, begin damning every oil rich Middle Eastern country or start praising the Lord that you don't have to watch any more of Al Gore's documentaries, there is something you should know. 

The combustion of pure hydrogen yields only water as a by-product, which is why it is bandied about by politicians as a "clean" source of energy. The problem lies in getting it to that pure state. As any student in a high school chemistry class can tell you, hydrogen is found predominantly in water, and is where we are getting our hydrogen from now. 

Splitting the water molecule, however, to produce pure hydrogen, requires enormous amounts of energy - energy which, should the use of hydrogen as a fuel source become widespread, would come primarily from fossil fuels. 

It would take so much energy to actually obtain the hydrogen that the factories or refineries actually burning the fossil fuels to produce it will be releasing enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to rival or even surpass emissions from today's gas-powered cars.

Unless we can find a more efficient way of getting hydrogen, the chances of this alternative energy source getting past the prototype stage is dismal.


Ethanol

Ethanol is making more of a push into the mainstream. Ethanol is actually a form of alcohol that is derived from the sugar or starch in crops such as corn and sugar cane. It is usually used as an additive to gasoline, with common mixtures being E10 (10 percent ethanol, 90 percent gasoline) and E85 (85 percent ethanol, 15 percent gasoline).

With the introduction of the "Flexfuel" system by General Motors, people can actually go out and buy a car that is capable of running on ethanol.

Ethanol fuel sources have already helped some countries gain energy independence. Brazil, for example, declared its independence from middle eastern oil in April of this year. 

The United States, obviously looking to mimic countries like Brazil, will probably have the greatest success using ethanol.

While the advantages of using ethanol outnumber its disadvantages, it does not come without them. 

In order to produce ethanol in the massive quantities needed to power a country such as the United States, a large number of crops are needed; therefore a considerable amount of water is also necessary - it takes around 300 million gallons of water to produce roughly 100 million gallons of ethanol.

This may not be an issue for water rich states such as Illinois, but it may pose a problem for drier midwestern states - where most of the crops would be grown.

 As I mentioned above, ethanol is not without fault. When compared to the consequences of widespread hydrogen production, however, the issue of a water shortage seems quite insignificant. 

There is no doubt that we as a country need to find newer, cleaner and more reliable sources of energy. The road, however, is not as straight as some might think or believe.

Headline: WHAT YOU MISSED OUT ON...
Subheadline: A look at news developments during Summer A
Author: Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
~Turnbull signs contract with Falcons~
MAY 1: Former Golden Panther defensive back Nick Turnbull signed an NFL free agent contract with the Atlanta Falcons.

Turnbull was a four-year defensive leader for the Golden Panthers and played in all 11 games last season at free safety. 

He ranked third on the team with 55 tackles (28 solo) and snatched a pair of interceptions.

Turnbull also scored three touchdowns on season, returning a blocked punt against Kansas State, taking a 73-yard fumble return for a score against Louisiana-Monroe and running back an interception 34 yards for a score versus Florida Atlantic Univeristy.


~Panther garage closed after collapse~
MAY 3: University officials closed the Panther Parking garage at University Park after part of the roof collapsed.

No one was injured when the 30-foot section, which University officials described as a cornice, fell from the five-story garage, said FIU spokeswoman Maydel Santana-Bravo.

The cornice, crown-molding type of decorative element, was located along the edge of the northern stairwell.

The parking garage was built two years ago to ease the shortage of parking on the campus.

Tampa-based Walker Parking Consultants was the architect hired to design the garage, located near the Pharmed Arena on the western part of campus.

The Miami construction company Pavarini was the builder, Santana-Bravo said. 

At least one student was inside the garage when it collapsed. 


~Science club volunteers at local center~
MAY 23: More than 30 Biscayne Bay Campus Science Club members volunteered at the William "Bill" Koppel Recreation Center to help neighborhood children become interested in the subject.

Club members helped clean up the surrounding area and conducted chemistry experiments with the children. 

The center, located in Highland Oaks, will allow the park to accommodate about 50 more children in spring, summer and after-school programs.


~Bush signs official law for medical school~
MAY 31: Governor Jeb Bush signed a bill to establish a $95 million university research fund and authorize new medical schools FIU and the University of Central Florida. 

The university bill signed May 30 includes a $20 million scholarship fund to attract prominent researchers to the state. Bush also allocated $30 million to create and expand research centers. 

The other $45 million will go towards building new high-tech facilities. He hopes the new bill will boost the state economy.


~Labrada hired to coach at St. Thomas~
JUNE 12: Jesus Labrada, assistant to head coach Sergio Rouco on the men's basketball team, was selected to direct the new St. Thomas University program. Labrada leaves after three seasons at FIU. He is familiar name in and around the South Florida area after spending six seasons with the University of Miami program.

Labrada became the second assistant on Rouco's staff to be named head coach of another problem after associate head coach Joe O'Brien was named to lead Idaho State University.


~Maidique granted pay increase~
JUNE 14: The University's Board of Trustees ruled to increase University President Modesto A. Maidique's salary. 

The three-year deal will raise Maidique's base salary by a little more than 20 percent - that's about an extra $77,000 per year. 

The approval also made him eligible for an annual $50,000 or higher performance bonus. This year, he will be earning more than $500,000 including the bonus, whose final amount is at the discretion of the board. 


~Texas Rangers draft infielder Cadena~
June 14: Senior infielder Nick Cadena signed a contract with the Texas Rangers June 14 after being selected by the team in the 30th round of the MLB draft - 398th overall. 

Cadena becomes the 123rd player in the 23-year tradition of FIU baseball to be either drafted or sign a free agent contract with a MLB team.

The senior, who split time playing shortstop and third base, was the only player on the team to start in all 60 games and finished 2006 with a .298 batting average, 10 homeruns, 56 RBI and 16 stolen bases.

The baseball team finished the season with a 36-24 overall record and went 12-12 in Sun Belt Conference play.


~Law bans travel to "terrorist states" ~
JUNE 19: Governor Bush banned Florida colleges and universities from using state money to travel to countries listed by the U.S. State Department as terror sponsors. The Travel to Terrorist States Act was also signed May 30 and prohibits spending state money on traveling to countries such as Cuba. 

The law was inspired by the arrests made last January of FIU professor Carlos Alvarez and his wife, Elsa Alvarez, an FIU counselor, on charges of being Cuban government agents. Carlos Alvarez had traveled to Cuba several times. 

The travel ban takes advantage of President George Bush's 2004 decision to tighten travel restrictions to Cuba. 


~University rejects Miami-Dade Transit Metrorail station plan~
JUNE 19: After Miami-Dade Transit had been planning for years to build its end-of-the-line station on a wedge of FIU land, University administrators at FIU don't want Metrorail to stop anywhere on the main campus.

Transit, and the county politicians who support it, have been promising the sales tax-paying masses that the future of Metrorail will include an East-West corridor that would roughly follow the Dolphin Expressway.

The 10.4-mile East-West line would link two key employment hubs, the Miami Intermodal Center next to the airport on the east, and FIU out west. Transit is now considering a new site about seven-tenths of a mile farther south, on county-owned land at Tamiami Regional Park.

FIU supports building an off-campus Metrorail station at the park because it ''wouldn't take up precious campus real-estate,'' said FIU Spokeswoman Maydel Santana-Bravo.

It might not be built until 2015, at the earliest, but this is an example of a decision that could reshape this community for the next 100 years and will be made by early fall.

Transit will ask the county commission and the Metropolitan Planning Organization to ratify the preferred local alignment, including the station sites, by the end of the year so they can submit it for federal approval next year.


~Alleged Cuban spy released on bond~
JUNE 21: Elsa Alvarez, a former psychology counselor at FIU, was released Tuesday, June 20 on bond after being arrested for allegedly providing information to the Cuban government. 

In ordering her release from federal detention, U.S. District Judge Michael Moore called the government's case against her weak, reported The Miami Herald.

The order noted that Elsa Alvarez tried to dissuade her husband, former FIU psychology professor Carlos Alvarez, from acting on behalf of the Cuban government.

The FBI arrested Elsa Alvarez and her husband in January. He remains in federal detention, awaiting trial. 

Among the conditions of her release are:
- She can't leave Miami-Dade County without court permission.
- She has to surrender her passport and travel documents.
- She can't visit airports, seaports or train or bus stations
- She must be placed on electronic monitoring.
- She has a nightly curfew.

FIU:
Longtime FIU employee to retire

Ann Goodrich, assistant director of Community Relations, will retire at the end of June, capping an award-winning 32-year career at FIU.

Goodrich came to FIU in January 1974 as a volunteer acquisition assistant in the library.

In 1996, The Ann H. Goodrich Volunteer of the Year Award was named in her honor in recognition of her service and is awarded each year to an employee for their outstanding volunteer service to the university.

A reception in her honor is scheduled for June 29, from 3 to 5 p.m., in the Graham Center Faculty Club at University Park.

FBI seizes hard drive after hacking of FIU

FBI agents seized a University computer hard drive at a week after a hacker vandalized two FIU websites with threatening messages, reported The Miami Herald.

According to FIU's technology security officer Cheryl Granto, the hacker hacked into the FIU system on June 19, defacing the school's library home page as well as the home page for the Biscayne Bay Campus student center.

The messages appeared with a black outlined hand and, according to Granto, stated:

"There are consequences for what you did against Muslims. Get ready to see this page in more websites. As you are publishing something that we don't like, you will see something that you don't like. So be careful about what you are doing about Muslims.''

Granto stated that the job wasn't by someone inside the school or someone else with inside information and didn't think that FIU is being solely targeted.  

As of June 25, there was no further information.

The U.S. death toll in Iraq reached 2,500 on June 22 as American forces remained locked in a bitter fight against insurgents and foreign terrorists.

The Pentagon reported that 18,940 U.S. service members have been wounded in the war to topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, which began more than three years ago and has left tens of thousands of Iraqis dead.

Meanwhile, an American general said coalition forces had killed 104 insurgents in 452 raids since terrorist chief Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed June 7 in a U.S. bombing raid.

Asked to comment on the significance of the 2,500 American deaths in Iraq, Army Brig. Gen. Carter Ham, the deputy director of regional operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it was important to remember that behind every death was an individual, and Americans should be very grateful to those individuals and their families.

Headline: Energy conservation class to open
Author: Jackie Diaz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU researchers hope to make alternative fuel sources available to consumers by using naturally grown resources in the United States and educating FIU students about this problem. 

This Fall semester, the College of Engineering and the Department of International Relations will offer a class taught by professor Jorge Gomez covering global energy and environmental policy issues, INR 4931.

Besides social and environmental issues, the class will also cover the connection with fuel and the Middle East as well as hurricanes and energy. 

The Applied Research Center, ARC, has several projects developing in hopes to find a solution to the world-wide petroleum shortage. 

Currently, Brazil is using 40 percent of its sugarcane production for ethanol, and Europe uses 20 percent of their canola (rapeseed plant) production for biodiesel. 

"The expected global peak shortage was anticipated for last year, but it will not pass 2010," said Gomez, who is also a renewable energies analyst. 

Biofuels is an alternative to reduce the consumption of petroleum. 

The United States uses one billion gallons of diesel annually and can face major economic problems if a solution is not found. 

Biofuel is fuel that is derived from living and recently living biological material, especially plants. 

It can also come from treated municipal and industrial wastes. 

There are two types of biofuel: ethanol and biodiesel. 

Biodiesel comes from vegetable oil or animal fat and can power existing diesel engines. Ethanol, derived from corn or sugarcane, can be used as fuel for automobiles either alone or as an additive to gasoline.

In 2004, the use of E85, which contains 10 percent gas and 85 percent ethanol, was mandated. 

The United States is the only country using this fuel source, and all gas stations nation-wide carry it. 

Ethanol alone can be used to fuel gasoline engines, but was used to replace Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). 

MTBE contaminates soil and groundwater and may also cause cancer and other ailments. 

"It is very interesting that we can have other substitutes for gas but at the same time I'm very surprised to know that we are using something else besides gas in our cars without knowing it," said sophomore Adriana Smith.  

According to Gomez, the benefits are numerous. The project emphasizes how a trade agreement will economically help countries in the western hemisphere instead of the eastern hemisphere, and that immigration problems could also be reduced because of this new demand.  

"The high demand for ethanol would allow farmers to grow substantial amounts of sugarcane and African palm," he said. 

African palm is another source for ethanol that only grows in tropical climates. 

This would indirectly attack the illegal drug problems in the Caribbean and South America. 

"With all the vegetable and animal fat in the U.S. we only produce 14 percent of our consumption," said Gomez. "We need a trade agreement from abroad."  

For now, Gomez says the key is to conserve energy. 

He suggests people purchase vehicles that accommodate their family size, bigger is not better. 

Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz and Jeep carry automobiles that run on diesel and biodiesel. 

Another possible solution is cogeneration, which is the use of two forms of energy, heat and power. 

 "In the future, I see many more hybrids circulating," Gomez said.

Headline: County slashes bus pass rates to attract students
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When Miami-Dade Transit slashes prices for monthly Metro Bus passes this fall, cash-strapped FIU students who depend on public transportation may catch a break.

"It's been something we've been talking about for a while," said Bill Foster, Director of Parking and Traffic.  "We expect it to be very successful."  

Currently, Miami-Dade Transit offers a student bus permit for a monthly fee of $56.25, which are sold at the Gold Garage at University Park through Parking Services. 

These permits allow students  unlimited to-and-from bus service on all Metro-Dade buses. A Parking Pass, which is sold separately for $6.25, allows for unlimited parking at Miami-Dade bus stops.

However, beginning Sept. 1, a six-month pilot program will begin. The price of a monthly bus pass for FIU students will be cut down to $37.50;  the monthly parking fee will stay the same.

"The management of it remains the same," Foster said. "The only thing that's reduced is the cost. That's the benefit of it."

FIU Parking & Traffic purchases the permits from Miami-Dade Transit, which are then sold to the students at cost.

"It's an offer we get exclusively through this contract," Foster said.  "About two weeks ahead of time, we go ahead and buy the permits, and it's usually based on what we've sold in the last couple of months … there's no administrative fee for that type of purchase."

Junior Sophia Del Zoppo uses the bus service weekly but never bought the passes because of the price. However, she is pleased about the cut and would now think about buying one.

"Now that the price has been cut, I   may consider buying it although I'm thinking about buying a car soon."     

Foster said that about 100 FIU students purchase the monthly Metro-Bus permits.  

"We expect that to significantly go up," he said, noting the 40 percent decrease in the price of a bus permit.  "We'd like to see more students take advantage of this opportunity.  This is a direct savings directly to a student."

As for what Miami-Dade Transit gets out of the deal, Foster stated that they hope to make money just by increasing the number of Metro-Bus riders.

"They just want more and more people," Foster said.  "It may be a lower rate, but they'll get more rider-ship."

The permits only apply to students using Metro-Dade buses. Currently, there is no Metrorail pass. 

"We're hopeful in the future that we can work something with them," Foster said. 

Negotiations with Miami-Dade Transit commenced during the Spring 2006 semester. Various deals and proposals were put forward before an agreement was reached.

"We had approached them earlier about a different kind of offer," Foster said, which he described as a Golden Panther Express type of service.  

"That didn't work out - they wanted way too much money to be able to do something like that."

Miami-Dade Transit then proposed providing a park-and-ride operation in conjunction with the University, which would have required FIU to set aside 200 to 250 parking spaces. According to Foster, Miami-Dade Transit has made similar deals with other universities.  

"We really don't have that capability to give an outside entity 250 parking spaces," said Foster.

"When a deal was finally agreed upon, we did not have to provide that as terms of this contract," he said. 

The final version was agreed upon in May.  However, the start-up date for the contract to officially take effect is three days after the Fall 2006 semester begins.

"We didn't want to start it in the summer when we don't have a very high volume of transit, and have the first three months of our pilot program based on a summer transportation," he said.

In the meantime, Parking Services intends to get the word out to students.

"We'll provide table access, which will work through the Graham Center for them to be able to promote it," Foster said. 

"We just hope people will make use of it," Foster said. "The more cars we can keep off campus, the better off we'll all be."

Headline: Audience applauds Iraq War forum
Subheadline: Congressman Murtha calls for troop redeployment
Author: Eddith Sevilla / BBC Asst. Editor
&nbsp;
Congressmen John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania and Kendrick Meek of Florida along with former congresswoman Carrie P. Meek received a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience consisting of students, faculty, city residents, state representatives, and commissioners on June 24 during the initiation of a town hall meeting held in the Mary Ann Wolfe Theatre at Biscayne Bay Campus. 

The forum, which was preceded by a private reception organized by the BBC Student Government Association to give invitees the opportunity to meet one another, was based on Murtha's call for a redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq but not excluded to other topics concerning the war.

"Polls indicate that 47 percent of the Iraqi people feel that the attacks on U.S. forces are justified, and that 80 percent of the Iraqi people want the U.S. forces out of Iraq," said Murtha, who served in the Marine Corps Reserve for 37 years and recently changed his debate on Iraq.

Congressman Kendrick Meek and his mother Carrie Meek advocate Murtha's stand on the issue. 

"Mr. Murtha has the knowledge and credibility to question the Bush Administration's conduct of the war in Iraq," Kendrick Meek said.

Part of the front row seats in the auditorium were reserved for veterans. Alvin Roberts, an officer with Vietnam Veterans of America, was there on behalf of congressman Meek along with other veterans in support of the event.

Kenasha Paul, a sophomore at FIU majoring in politcal science who has had family take part in both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and has a neutral stand on the war, was there to find out the complete status on what's going on in Iraq. 

"I feel that the government has not given out enough information right now, and I don't want to make a biased judgment on whether it's a just or unfair war," Paul said. "That's one of the reasons I'm here."

Faculty members in attendance felt such a forum is important for students. 

"It was a unique learning experience for FIU students attending as well as the student government members who helped [put] the event together," said Craig Cunningham, BBC SGA advisor and director of Campus Life. "I hoped it sparked students' interest in national issues."

English professor Richard Sugg, faculty advisor for the BBC College Democrats club, also felt that such a forum is essential to college students.

"Students go to college to hear high level discussion of relevant contemporary issues," Sugg said. 

"It's the duty of every citizen and everybody who graduates from college to be ready to stand up and take some position on contemporary issues and the war in Iraq is the biggest contemporary issue there is."

Congressman Murtha expressed the need for student involvement as well.

"Students have to understand what is going on. They have to hear the people that are in Washington representing them and what they think," Murtha said. "It's important that they get involved in these kinds of things and of course, since there isn't a draft, a lot of them don't get involved."

Camilo Silva, BBC SGA president, felt that the forum was also important for students.

"These issues affect the people from our community, immigrants in particular, because they are the ones going to war," said Silva, who decided not to voice his opinion on the war.

Silva honored each congressman as well as Carrie Meek with an SGA leadership medallion.

Headline: Argentinian café serves tasty cuisine
Author: Lalinda De La Fuente / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
One distinctive characteristic of Miami is the large Hispanic population that creates an atmosphere rich with stimulating culture.  There is a bevy of culinary locales around every corner to serve up authentic and carefully crafted cuisine from your choice of Hispanic nations.  

In Aventura, La Estancia Argentina serves up simple and fast fare that is not only inspired by their Argentine name, but also the American ground that they reside on.

La Estancia Argentina's small location on Biscayne Boulevard in Aventura is a relaxed café that invites one to sit down and nibble on your food at ease. 

While waiting for your food, one can browse their selection of gourmet foods and wines - most of which are imported from South America.  

La Estancia Argentina also offers a meat counter where you can purchase top quality cuts of meat anywhere from Argentina's infamous steak, pork, lamb and homemade sausages.

Offered up at La Estancia Argentina are an array of soups, salads, sandwiches and entrees made fresh in its kitchen from its exceptional cuts of meat. 

A bowl of soup coupled with their delicious Argentine empanadas makes for a quick and light meal choice.

 An Argentine empanada, which is baked and stuffed with anything from spinach and vegetables to chicken or meat, is a great addition to any meal eaten at this Argentine café.  

Although slightly expensive at $1.40 a pop and $15 for an assorted dozen (especially when a person can easily eat more than one), these empanadas are worth coupling with your food or taking home as an in-between-meal snack.

Although an empanada habit can become somewhat expensive, other fares at La Estancia Argentina are surprisingly affordable. 

Fresh ceviche runs a mere $6 while a cut of filet mignon wrapped in bacon is only $9. Although their chicken vegetable soup is a simple staple, their soups of the day - such as a smooth cream of mushroom - is always worth a try.

Headline: Students rate professors on academics, appearance
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Assistant Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Before registering for any classes, sophomore Carlos Diaz checks RateMyProfessor.com, a website where college students can read and write reviews about course instructors.

"I've heard horror stories about some professors who practically ask you to sell your soul to get through the tons of work they assign," Diaz said. "If I want to avoid professors with such attitudes and impossible demands, I check the website."

Since 1999, RateMyProfessor.com has stored reviews from more than 6,000 universities. 

The format is simple: Users choose their school and browse through the different rating categories to find the appropriate professor. 

The ratings, based on a 1-5 scale, are grouped into three categories: easiness, helpfulness, and clarity. Reviewers can also write a brief description about the professor. 

"The ratings system is great because it focuses on the three areas that students should care about when picking a teacher," said junior Alfredo Valdivia. "Obviously, things like helpfulness and clarity are huge factors in determining a student's grasp of the material." 

While some students believe the ratings system is effective, others believe that improvement is needed. 

Although many of the site's reviews give readers a detailed idea of a particular professor's teaching style, several reviews are inaccurate and consist of just one sentence. 

"The website is a good source for learning about professors, but it needs some way to monitor reviews for accuracy," said SGA Student Services Chairman Wolfgang Acevedo "Occasionally, the reviews don't match up with what the professor is really like."

In addition to rating professors on different academic characteristics, students can rate their professor's appearance as well. If a professor is considered "hot" by many reviewers, this trait is demonstrated by the picture of a chili pepper next to the instructor's name. 

"I don't think the chili pepper is necessary," said sophomore Anthony Sobers-Assue. "It doesn't deal with anything regarding the professor's teaching. It's just for kicks."

English professor Kenneth Claus interprets the chili pepper's use differently. 

"The chili pepper really suggests that the professor in question understands their students and has some really good energy that they put into their classroom work." Claus said. "It alerts students that there is a professor who works with and for students and values them and their work."

RateMyProfessor.com is not the only source of professor reviews available to students. 

At the end of each semester, students are asked to review their instructors through the use of student evaluation forms. 

The results of these evaluations are then posted on the Office of Planning and Institutional Effectiveness's website, which can be accessed from http://sis.fiu.edu. 

Unlike the format used by RMP and similar web pages, the FIU student evaluations use a percentage scale and deal with eight topics such as the professor's ability to describe course objectives and the stimulation of interest in coursework. 

Despite its range of categories, these evaluations are sometimes overlooked by students.

"Students barely pay attention to these evaluations because not all students are present when these evaluations are given, and the ratings don't really give an answer to what students want to know, such as a teacher's easiness," said junior Ivy Fernandez.

According to Claus, RMP has a distinct advantage that separates it from other evaluation websites: credibility.

"Students tend to generally give value and trust to the comments the comments because the comments come across as real," said Claus. "Student evaluations note a professor has consistently poor evaluations, and it has made absolutely no difference in that professor's teaching style."

Other popular websites include RatingsOnline.com and MySpace.com, the latter of which features its own Professor Grading section. 

With so many sources to check out before picking classes, students should be able to easily find accurate information about their professors and choose the one that best fits their needs.

Subheadline: University recreation center offers students multitude of fitness options
Author: Reuben Pereira / Assistant News Director
&nbsp;
Walking into the University's state-of-the-art Recreation Center, it's impossible not to be overwhelmed by the abundance of space and light that floods the lobby. From the stylish front desk to the weight rooms, the 50,000 square feet facility defines elegance. 

However, the facility  - located at University Park - is more than just a pretty building. 

It's a place where many students go to socialize with friends while enjoying a good workout. It is this factor that led the facility to be recognized as the 2006 Outstanding Sports Facility by the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association. 

The center features more than 10,000 square feet of fitness space including free weights; resistant machines and cardio equipment; a two court gym for volleyball, basketball, and badminton; and two fitness rooms that offer a multitude of fitness classes for students and members alike. 

Junior Sameer Rashid, a regular visitor of the center, is most pleased with the extended hours of operation. 

Rashid, a biology major, found it hard to find time for the gym due to his work and class schedules. 

Since the new facility's opening last year, Rashid has found the gym to be a lot more accessible. 

"The extended hours is what really makes the gym worthwhile," Rashid said. "I can come in at 10 p.m. and still enjoy two hours of basketball with my friends or work out on the weight machines. At the old gym, this wouldn't be possible."

Since its opening during the fall semester of 2005, the center has been home to a variety of fitness classes whose extensive schedules range from early morning to late evening classes and include fitness regimes from Yoga and Kickboxing to BodyPump and Ultimate Core. 

More specialized fitness programs include a Women on Weights, CPR training, and Group Fitness Training program

Fitness coordinator Christina Theosevis emphasized that students needs are extremely important when deciding what fitness regimes are taught at the center. 

Theosevis stated that instructors give out student evaluation sheets in classrooms so students can select what they like or don't like and what they would like to see more of. 

She also said that coordinators try to have classes of variety such as a Latin Dance Fitness to incorporate the diversity of south Florida. This way, the classes would attract a larger, more diverse audience.

"We try to bring a lot of popular things to the fitness classes and incorporate a multitude of ideas to motivate students who wouldn't usually visit gyms," Theosevis said.

Theosevis was also proud of the center's personal training program. When a student signs up for the personal training program, he or she is first matched up with a nationally certified instructor of his or her choice. 

After this, they have a consultation and an assessment test during which the instructor analyzes how the training will have to be scheduled. 

Students can also sign up for group training sessions where friends workout with one instructor on similar but personalized regimes. 

Ever since moving from the Pharmed Arena into its own facility, the center has more than doubled the fitness equipment available for students so they don't have to wait in line to workout.

Sophomore Jaime Martinez, who visits the gym whenever he has classes on campus, greatly enjoys the availability of equipment and the laid back environment.

"I really like that there is plenty of equipment and I don't have to wait in line to use any of the machines," Martinez said. "You can sit down and do your thing at your own pace without worrying about the next person waiting in line."

Apart from the general fitness services, the recreation center also hosts club sports, intramural sports and outdoor adventure recreation programs while also creating employment opportunities to more than 100 students every year.

 Junior Gabriel Rodriguez has worked as a customer service representative at the recreation center for over a year and considers working at the facility an enjoyable experience that offers flexible hours and a relaxed environment.

"The benefit of working at the recreation center is the accommodating schedule and the fantastic working environment," Rodriguez said. "In my personal opinion, the best thing about the center is the staff - from the trainers to the customer service representatives. They are what makes the experience worthwhile."

A cafeteria, Camille's Sidewalk Café, is scheduled to open in the fall. In the years to follow there are plans to build an indoor running track, a rock climbing wall, racquetball courts and a swimming pool.
