Headline: Swimmer born in Hungarian waters
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
For most people, swimming is as simple as moving your arms around, but for Claudia Barsi it is a way of life.

Besides swimming in 45-degree water for almost 14 miles at the European Championship, Barsi is a simple girl who hates doing laundry and loves Britney Spears. The Beacon had a chance to interview the Hungarian native who holds various records at the Bay Vista Aquatics Center. 

Q. What type of preparation is needed before a swimming competition?

It starts with what I eat. I mostly try to eat chicken and pasta, because they contain a lot of energy, which I will need. I also  go to sleep as early as I can. If I swim slow, I won't be able to swim good so I practice as hard as I can to do good.

Q. People don't realize how long a 1,000-yard race is. That is the length of 10 football fields. What is running through your head as you are competing in one of these competitions?

I don't really think of anything. I'm from Hungary, so I'm used to swimming in open waters like beaches, rivers and lakes where the shortest I would swim was like two and a half miles. Nothing runs through your head. It's moment by moment; you can't think.

Q. The following day after a big competition, do you feel any aches and pains in your body?

If I practice hard before [a] meet, I don't feel anything. But, if I don't practice hard, my shoulders and legs start to hurt, because my body is not used to it.

Q. Does being a competitive swimmer require a special diet? If so, what does it consist of?

I wish I could be on a diet, but I'm not. I just eat whatever I can eat, especially foods with carbs.

Q. How has former Olympic veteran and FIU coach Noemi Lung Zaharia helped you develop your swimming techniques? 

When I was little I got the basic stuff for swimming, 'cause my mom was a swimmer, and my dad played water polo. You can say I was born in the water. Coach has helped me, though, because she knows what's the best thing for me and when I can swim at my best. She was a swimmer, so she knows everything and understands what I need to do to improve.

Q. Is an Olympic appearance a goal for you in the future?

I was planning to go last year in the open water competition because they said it was going to be an event, but it didn't happen. I am waiting for 2008, but back home it's hard to make the Olympic tryouts. Hungary is a small country, so lots of people participate.

Q. At this point in time, who wins in a race between you and coach Zaharia?

Oh, me [laughs]. Actually, she swam the other day in practice, but [laughs some more] yeah come on. I think I can. She's like 35 or 40-years-old.

Q. Is it difficult to manage being a full-time student while being part of the swimming team?

It's not hard. I can manage my time. So, if I know what I have to do, I can do it. 

Q. What is a typical day in your life?

We have practice from 6 to 7:30 in the morning. After that, I go to school and later, I have lunch. Then, we practice again from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., and sometimes we have weights after that. Then, I go home to take a nap, 'cause I have classes at night after.

Q. If your house was on fire, and you could only go back and get three material things, assuming your family was safe, what would you get?

My photo album, medals and my bed. I would really miss my bed, so I would somehow get it out.

Q. Would you shed three years of your life for an Olympic medal?

No. My life is more important than that. People that win Olympic medals are sometimes forgotten. People that win medals still have to study and work. Then, after a period of time, people forget the person. It's important for the moment, but then people forget you. 

Q. What made you come to FIU?

One of my friends from Hungary came to FIU, and she told me to come swim. I talked to [the] coach, and then I came. I was planning to study journalism, but because all the classes are at North Campus, and we practice here, I couldn't do it. So now, I am studying international business.

Q. What are the best and worst things about FIU?

The best is that there are a lot of international students, and I like to make friends. The worst is that I hate having to do laundry, because the machines here are always broken.

Q. If you were not swimming, would you be involved in another sport?

I would probably be playing tennis. When I was four, I had to decide between the two sports, and I chose swimming.

Headline: Golden Panthers lose third straight on the road
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The last thing the Golden Panthers were looking for was their longest losing streak of the season. 

Unfortunately, for Sergio Rouco's men, that's exactly what they found in Philadelphia with a 74-72 loss to LaSalle in overtime.

Having lost two consecutive conference games in Arkansas, FIU traveled to the City of Brotherly Love for its last game of a three-game road trip, and the conclusion of the team's out-of- conference schedule. 

The Golden Panthers were taken to overtime for the third time this season only to lose their second in a row in the extra period. 

FIU played from behind the entire night, something that has plagued them since the beginning of the new year. FIU trailed at the half by three and didn't grab their first lead of the game until 45 seconds into the second frame, at 30-29. 

With 3.1 seconds left in regulation and FIU down three, 64-61, senior Junior Matias was fouled and sent to the line with the chance to tie the game. 

The senior connected on all three from the charity stripe and sent the Golden Panthers into overtime for the second game in a row. 

The extra period belonged to Lasalle's Tabby Cunningham. Cunningham led the Explorers in front of their home crowd, winning seven of the team's 10 points in overtime. 

Junior Ismael N'Diaye once again came up big for the Golden Panthers, scoring the first basket of the extra period. N'Diaye scored all eight of FIU's overtime points as the Golden Panthers fell short for the third game in a row. 

Matias had a chance to tie the game for the second time as time expired in overtime, but failed on an off-balance jump-shot in the paint.

Junior Ivan Almonte led all scorers on the night with 24 points, 15 of which came in the first half. 

Steven Smith led the Explorers with 22 points while Tabby Cunningham added 17.

"We played well," said junior Ismael N'Diaye. "We just didn't know how to stay in the game. We made a couple of bad plays before the end of the game that cost us."

The loss puts the Golden Panthers under the .500 mark for the first time this season at seven wins and eight losses.

Headline: To drop or not?
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Opinion Page Designer
&nbsp;
With the excitement and chaos of the first week over, it's time to finalize your schedule and take control of what your semester is going to look like. 

This may include dropping or adding a class. You might say, "More changes? But I just figured out that PC and CP are two different buildings!" 

However, it's far better to make these changes now, rather than to drop a course later or worse yet, fail.   Remember, the final drop/add date is Jan. 18. Your time and your money are at stake; here are some tips to make the most of them: 

This isn't starting well... 

Sometimes, you can tell how good - or soul-crushingly awful - a class is going to be on the first day. Keep in mind that titles of classes mean nothing. 

One bad sign is when the professor strolls in 15 minutes late, and then asks the class what class he or she is teaching. Another bad sign is when that same professor hasn't seen or can't pronounce the name of the $90 textbook you just bought for the class. At this point you should get up and leave. And if you're anything like me, throw the book at your professor for wasting your time. Aim between the eyes. 

If you get past the formalities of roll-taking and syllabus-explanation, you're going to want to notice small details. If your professor checks his or her watch more than you do, that is not a good sign. 

Also, keep your senses keen. Should the professor walk by and the smell of gin waft through the air, think of it as a smoke alarm. Then again, that smell could be a lifeline as it shows you'll probably have a chance to argue your grade over a beer at Gracie's Grill. 

Anticipate the worst, hope for the best

We would all like to think that, as college students, we are superhuman. So, taking five classes; joining a fraternity, student government and the anime club; and having a part-time job while volunteering at a puppy store will be no sweat, right? 

Not so much - unless you like ulcers. Know your limits. Taking three classes and getting As is better than taking five and getting Cs. College is not a race. No one cares whether you graduate at 21 or 23. 

If you keep up that schedule you'll end up shaking and huddled in a corner on the third floor of  the library repeating the quadratic formula.

From pre-med to music performance

Majors are like LifeSavers: you pretty much want to try all of them, even grape - which tastes like crap. The average student changes majors three to four times throughout his or her college career. 

When you don't really know what classes to take and you have no idea what you want to be, it's inevitable that you'll drop one. And we all know advising doesn't help. No matter what your academic advisor says, taking modern dance is not going to help you as a chemistry major. Although, being limber is fun.

Sanity is key

All in all, dropping a class is nothing to be ashamed about. Self-preservation is the objective of any successful semester. Good luck. You'll need it.

Headline: Organization joins tsunami relief effort
Author: Juan Garcia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The tsunami catastrophe that occurred on December 26, 2004 brought much focus and attention to the devastated countries of Southern Asia. In response the world is bringing aid to their doorstep and FIU is doing its part as well.

Children's Relief and You America is an organization that has been dedicated to helping the children of India, even before the December 2004 tsunami devastated the coastal regions of the country. 

Abbas Salehmohamed, acting president of CRY America's FIU chapter, said that, according to UNICEF, children comprise just over 38 percent of India's 1.03 billion inhabitants. That's over 400 million children, many of whom are malnourished, diseased and uneducated. 

In recent years, India made progress in feeding, immunizing and educating more and more of its children. This disaster now threatens to wipe out whatever progress it has made in the previous years.

Like various other Student Organization's Council clubs and organizations at FIU, CRY America is holding a fundraiser to provide economic aid to the children of India. 

"Our SOC club was founded on this very principle of compassion, and we will try our level-best to get FIU students involved," Salehmohamed said. 

CRY in India has joined a group of Non-Governmental Organizations including Oxfam, CARE, UNICEF and Save the Children, to ensure better planning, coordination and accountability of fund deployment efforts. 

"We can't help but be thankful and appreciative for all that we often tend to take for granted. After all, what principle difference is there between us and those who were affected so drastically by the deadly waves?" asked Salehmohamed. 

According to CNN news, the tsunami devastation has triggered what could be the largest worldwide collaborative humanitarian relief effort to date. The amount of aid received has been so great that there might even be some serious logistical problems distributing it. 

Salehmohamed invites students, staff and anyone interested in donating money or participating in the tsunami relief effort to visit www.america.cry.org for more information. 

Donations can also be dropped off at the SOC office in GC 2300 or made via check to "CRY America Inc," memo to Tsunami Support. CRY America FIU can be reached at cryamericafiu@yahoo.com.

Headline: Security set for inauguration
Author: Michelle Mittelstadt / The Dallas Morning News
&nbsp;
Anti-aircraft battery units and combat air patrols will search the skies as rooftop sharpshooters scan the streets below, Coast Guard cutters ply the Potomac and Anacostia rivers, and bomb-sniffing dogs patrol the subway system.

Next week's 55th presidential inaugural - the first of the post-Sept.-11 era and occurring against the backdrop of war - will offer an unprecedented level of security for the swearing-in of a U.S. president.

Six thousand law enforcement officers, 2,500 military personnel and countless other federal, state and local officials will be part of an intricate - some say stifling - security blanket that has been nearly a year in the making.

The security force is augmented by a high-tech arsenal that includes sniffers to detect chemical and biological hazards, bomb jammers and a network of surveillance cameras fixed on downtown, bolstered by video feeds from helicopters.

 A hundred-square-block area stretching from the White House to the Capitol and beyond will be off-limits to traffic on Thursday, Inauguration Day, and pedestrians in barricaded zones will have to go through metal detectors at 22 checkpoints.

Manhole covers are being sealed, ventilation ducts secured; and security teams will sweep hotels, offices and residential buildings that line the parade route. And while deliveries are being discouraged within the restricted areas, vehicles that must enter will be scanned by X-ray portals.

"Our goal is that any attempt on the part of anyone or any group to disrupt the inaugural will be repelled by multiple layers of security," Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said.

Demonstrators coming to town to protest President Bush, the war in Iraq and other policies contend that some security measures are aimed less at terrorists than at suppressing dissent and keeping critics far removed from the president.

"They are trying to make a very big issue out of security, and we think part of that is to keep people away," said Bill Hackwell of the anti-war A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition. "Over half the country is opposed to this war, and we think that Bush should not be allowed to sort of sanitize Pennsylvania Avenue from dissent."

Ridge, D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey and other law enforcement officials play down the protest angle, focusing their attention on the terrorism possibility.

Although U.S. officials have not detected any specific inaugural threat, Ridge said authorities cannot let down their guard during an event he called "the most visible manifestation of our democracy."

The first inaugural since the Sept. 11 attacks "obviously raises security concerns that we didn't have to contend with in the past," Ramsey said.

Security will be choreographed from two locations: A joint military command center at Fort McNair in Washington and a state-of-the-art location in Herndon, Va., 25 miles northwest of town, manned by representatives of 50 federal, state and local agencies under the leadership of the Secret Service.

Law enforcement officials from 60 departments around the country are coming to supplement the D.C. police force - with the city footing an overtime bill that D.C. Administrator Robert Bobb estimated would exceed $11 million.

Ridge said he could not assess the federal tab for security, saying it would be in the "millions."

Heightened security is omnipresent in a city scarred by the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes, the anthrax-by-mail attacks, a ricin scare on Capitol Hill and the ever-present knowledge that Washington is a symbolic target to terrorists.

U.S. Capitol Police patrol the grounds around the Capitol with assault rifles; fences ring the Washington Monument; and massive concrete planters and barricades pop up around the city with regularity.

At Ridgewells, a catering firm juggling many inaugural events, workers have undergone background checks, submitted photos and obtained credentials to make deliveries in the restricted zones. Caterers have been ordered to deliver all equipment the night before the inaugural, with food deliveries completed by 7 a.m. Thursday.

"Security has always been tight for inaugurals, but it is a little bit tighter," said Susan Niemann, a Ridgewells principal. "For the most part, we are coping with it."

Headline: The End is nigh for the 'Left Behind' book series
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Although it did not receive as much media attention as a Harry Potter book would have, Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkin's "Glorious Appearing," the last novel in their popular "Left Behind" series, has certainly made its impact on the publishing industry. It has sold well over one million copies since its summer release. The series as a whole sold well over a billion books around the world.

Geared toward a mostly evangelical, Protestant audience, the novels are a prose interpretation of what many Christians believe to be Bible passages predicting the end of the world.

In the first book, "Left Behind," chaos engulfs the globe as thousands of men, women and children suddenly disappear one night, seemingly yanked right out of the earth by Jesus Christ who wants to save his followers from the coming of the end of times.

However, as natural disasters and wars led by the charming but devil-possessed Nicolae Carpathia (the Antichrist) ravage the world, a band of believers, who became Christians only after the rapture of the righteous begins to take prophecy into its own hands, battling the forces of evil as it awaits the second coming of Christ.

"Glorious Appearing," the 12th book of the series, wraps up these struggles as we find the forces of the Antichrist nearing a fortress occupied by the believers preparing for Armageddon with the largest army the world has ever seen. 

However, the Antichrist's attempts at a massacre are foiled once Jesus makes his promised appearance, slays the enemies of his followers and establishes a kingdom on Earth that is predicted to last 1000 years.

Though stuffed with vivid imagery and written in a modern, Stephen King sort of prose, readers who have not yet delved into the previous 11 books should avoid this one.

Even for those who have gobbled up the entire chronicle, "Glorious Appearance" might prove to be a bit disappointing. The conclusion, after all, has been a given since the start: Reader's are expecting Christ's return, and he comes.

Shifting from the various characters' point of views, we are able to witness the action that unfolds around the fortress and other parts of the Middle East (the setting of the book), though this shifting doesn't always work, and the reader is left wondering whom they're following and why.

Also, being that the novel was primarily written for a Christian audience, non-Christians or those who follow different biblical interpretations might be puzzled or even shocked by such scenes as Jesus staining his robe with the blood of his enemies as they blow up right under his feet.

The end of the book, set on a renovated Earth now ruled by God, also seemed rather shoddy and unprepared, as though LaHaye and Jenkins cared more about stressing their theological views than about developing the final fate of their characters.

It is possible to think that with movies, book spin-offs, church discussion kits and a hundred other marketable products bearing the "Left Behind" title, the authors spent too much time endorsing their line, making what should have been the crown of their labor - "Glorious Appearing" - not so glorious.

Headline: Datsuns delivers a 'sound' message
Author: Chuck Myers / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
The Datsuns understand the value of patience.

The New Zealand rock quartet (bassist/vocalist Dolf de Borst, guitarist Phil Buscke, guitarist Christian Livingstone and drummer Matt Osment) has made slow but steady strides over roughly the past 10 years.

With a reputation for its frenetic, high-powered stage shows, the band began to gain a full head of steam in the past two years on the strength of positive reviews, particularly in the British press, for its a self-titled debut album in 2003 and solid sophomore effort, Outta Sight/Outta Mind (V2 Records), in 2004. 

"On the first record, everything's pretty much foot to the floor," recalled de Borst. "It kind of felt like a singles collection or something like that. Because, in a way, we were doing that. ... But with the second record, there's definitely songs we recorded for that. I think we recorded 14 songs and ended up leaving a couple off, which, I think, actually are amazing song."

While contemporaries such as The Strokes and The Vines stumbled with releases last year, The Datsuns continued to make strides forward. Outta Sight/Outta Mind serves up the group's signature music punch infused with musical influences ranging from hard rock and punk to `70s era glam rock. De Borst noted, for instance, that the group went for a glam edge on the Outta Sight/Outta Mind number "You Can't Find Me." 

A bit of good fortune shined on The Datsuns as it prepared to work on Outta Sight/Outta Mind. John Paul Jones, bassist and keyboardist for legendary rock band Led Zeppelin, caught one of the band's shows, and offered to assist with producing Outta Sight/Outta Mind, which The Datsuns accepted gladly.

Originally called Trinket, the group changed its name to The Datsuns after it won a "battle of the bands" competition in New Zealand in 1997. Each band member soon adopted a Datsun surname, as a way to distinguish themselves from players in other bands with similar names. In 2004, The Datsuns relocated to London to be closer to the music world pulse.

While the band's albums show its musical growth and have enjoyed positive feedback, the group feels more at home on the stage than in the studio.

"I think we've always been a band that comes from performing and playing live to people," observed De Borst. "And we're kind of making the transition to being both, making it 50-50, which I'll never be comfortable with, because I always kind of believe that performance is the most sort of honest way to playing music and getting it across to people."

Yet, the frontman also added that there's still plenty of room for the growth in the studio - but at a deliberate pace set by the group.

"We're still kind of looking to make a record that really defines us, and puts our foot down as not just as really good performers, but as songwriters. ... We've only made two records the whole time we've been together. And usually bands don't even last as long as we have. I think making the next record we'll take a lot more time."

Headline: New 'Alias' season proves more exciting than last
Author: Michelle Ferrer / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Ladies and gentlemen start reserving your Wednesday nights, for as of Jan. 5, ABC's "Alias" is back. Golden Globe nominee, Jennifer Garner, has returned to the small screen with her character, Sydney Bristow. 

Creator, J.J. Adams, has kicked-off season four exactly where season three left off. After leaving a safe deposit box in Wittenberg, we find that Sydney has gone from being the CIA's top field agent to a deep undercover special operations representative. She works alongside the two people she likes least in this world: her father (Victor Garber) and Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), her new boss and the man who deceived her two years ago by making her believe she worked for a secret sector of the CIA, SD-6, when in fact she was working for the enemy. 

Sydney must now work under the man she vowed to never trust and learn to work beside her father knowing that he killed her mother. 

Thrown into the loop of an already intricate plot is Sydney's longtime, on-again, off-again boyfriend, Vaughn (Michael Varitan) and her half-sister, Nadia (Mia Maestro), who recently discovered her father was none other than Sloane. 

The fourth season of Alias promises to be full of action. "In a second, everything can change," said freshman Beena Kazi.

Things are never what they seem. Covers are compromised, plans derailed and even your best friend can turn out to be a mole within the CIA. 

"I was completely glued to the screen when it premiered. It's completely addicting," said freshman Patricia Perez. 

This season, the show only promises to get better. There is no doubt that the show's heart-stopping suspense and excellent fight choreography will keep viewers coming back for more, each week.

Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) stumbles to find the right words in English to express her hot-tempered Mexican emotions, while her insecure boss, Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni) tries to Americanize her.

 Spanish actress, Paz Vega's Hollywood breakthrough performance in the film "Spanglish" takes many FIU students whose parents have immigrated to the United States back to a familiar time when their parents considered them personal (and not to mention portable) dictionaries.

 The story is told through the eyes of an older and wiser Cristina (Shelby Bruce), Flor's daughter, who is trying to appeal to a Harvard Admission's committee. 

In the film she appears at a much younger age and she does an excellent job juggling the responsibilities of growing up with a single-mother, who can't hold a conversation with her American employers.

 Children of immigrants can easily identify with Cristina's character. And now, in college, when most of us have closed the door to childhood and entered the adult-life, we can better understand characters such as Flor and sympathize with the difficulties our parents faced entering this country.

 The major issue Flor's character faces is arriving in a new country where she can be herself and remain true to her strong Mexican upbringing. The irony is that Flor journeys across the border in search of the American Dream, but she finds disappointment, hardship and love in the wrong Los Angeles mansion.

 Immigrant or not, audience-members can identify with fighting to be different.

The movie surrounds itself with the culture clashes, which occur when a Mexican immigrant, Flor, becomes the housekeeper for an upperclass Los Angeles couple. But along with culture clashes there are also culture clichés. 

Not only is Flor a housekeeper, a single-mother, and a Mexican immigrant, but she also turns to Inglés Sin Barreras when she struggles to learn English. Both mother and daughter have olive skin and dark hair, which sadly fits the wet-back Mexican stereotype.

When the Clasky family decides to go on a month-long vacation to a California beach the culture clashes hit an all time high.

In one scene, Flor is outraged when Mrs. Clasky takes Cristina to do errands without her permission and ends up dyeing her jet-black virgin hair with blue streaks.

Besides the growing love between Mrs. Clasky and Cristina, another interesting and tense relationship develops between Flor and Mr. Clasky. 

They are able to overcome the language barrier and express themselves through their humility and good-hearted nature, which leaves Mrs. Clasky raising her eyebrow in suspicion.   

Each scene is constructed to help the audience learn more about each individual character as well as the plot itself. At the end of the film, the audience develops a connection with each character, no matter the age, gender, or language.     

The eight-month-long production was directed by Academy Award winner James L. Brooks, who also directed such hits as Terms of Endearment, As Good as It Gets, and Jerry Maguire.

The story came to life when Brooks, who doesn't speak a word of Spanish, hired Vega, who in turn hired a translator to produce the film. 

Vega has proven to rise above the intimidation and fear an immigrant feels upon arriving in America, not only in the movie but also in real-life.

She could prove to be Spain's most demanded export since Penelope Cruz. Olé!

Subheadline: Hot rides steer students away from pumps

With more than 60 percent of FIU students living at home and driving to school, fuel consumption is a critical issue. 

Take a look across the parking lots and you will notice fewer V-8 SUVs and more small, fuel-efficient four-cylinder cars. With gas prices as high as they have been, most college students will admit that driving to and from FIU takes a toll on their bank accounts. 

The auto industries have begun producing lightweight, fuel-efficient cars with lower price tags to combat the rising fuel prices. So for the college student in need of a vehicle of such caliber, there are a few new ones that are sure to set their mark within the next year.

Traditionally, Asian car manufacturers are known for their fuel efficiency, but within the past few years American companies have given the Asian market a run for its money, because they have also joined the fight against fuel consumption. 

Commonly, the idea of fuel efficiency means sacrificing performance. This is hardly true anymore given the new designs of economy cars. 

According to the consumer issue of "Road and Track Magazine," a good example of this is the new Chevrolet Cobalt. With this new American made pocket-rocket, the Chevy power tradition meets much needed fuel efficiency.  

For just under $14,000, the sporty Cobalt comes standard with a 145 horsepower four-cylinder engine. This gives the car a more than expected quickness while providing an impressive 26 miles-per-gallon in the city and 33 miles-per-gallon on the highway. 

Not enough power? The Cobalt SS model comes equipped with a supercharged 205 horsepower engine for around $21,000 that doesn't sacrifice much on fuel mileage.  

From England we get the Mini Cooper, one of the most popular and affordable cars in today's growing market. 

"Mini Coopers are great. I get great gas mileage with every tank," said freshman Cristina Villacorta, an owner of the Mini Cooper S. "I'm at three-quarters of a tank, and I still won't have to refill for another week-and-a-half!" she said. 

With a classic body reminiscent of the old Mini Cooper, a more powerful engine and a sporty suspension, this fuel saver has become common at FIU. At a base price of $16,449, as reported on the Car and Driver website, this car offers sporty looks, expected European performance, well-known reliability and affordable fuel mileage (28 miles-per-gallon in the city and 37 miles-per-gallon on the highway).   

However, for those of you who love your SUVs, Pontiac didn't forget about you when they produced the Pontiac Vibe. "I'm looking into getting a new car like an SUV. My friend has the Pontiac Vibe, and he gets great mileage, better than my Honda for sure," said freshman Emily Jacque, current owner of a Honda Civic. 

Although you may be unsure about classifying this as an SUV because of its low profile appearance, the Vibe comes nicely equipped for $17,475. This is not a bad price for a quality SUV.  The only downside to the Vibe is a small 130 horsepower engine, which might not be enough to sufficiently carry an SUV. However, it saves fuel and averages 30 miles-per-gallon in the city and 36 miles-per-gallon on the highway.  

These are just some of the choices to consider when looking for a new and more efficient vehicle. 

So when you become tired of paying $2 per gallon twice a week, forget the F-150s and Expeditions, and consider scaling down to the face of the future: pocket-rockets.
