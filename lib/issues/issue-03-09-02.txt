Headline: Women's soccer drops opener to Jacksonville
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU failed to get off to the start it was hoping for, getting blanked in its debut by the Jacksonville Dolphins 4-0 at the Ashley Sports Complex in Jacksonville, Fla. Aug. 29.

Sophomore Ranveig Aas-Hanssen led the Dolphin route with two goals and an assist.

Aas-Hanssen started the scoring early in the 13th minute when she directed a Jenny Borschel cross past FIU goalkeeper Juliana Gomez with a header.

Aas-Hanssen added her second goal of the night in the 54th minute on a strike from about two yards out, courtesy of an assist from senior Inge Heiremans, to increase the JU lead to 2-0.

Heiremans followed less than two minutes later, converting on a header off a corner kick by Erin Bitterli to make the score 3-0.

Gomez's first start at goalkeeper got worse when Borschel scored her first goal of the game from about five yards out.

Carly Agro then replaced Gomez and shut out JU for the final 19:08 for FIU, who fell to 0-3 all-time against the Dolphins.

The Golden Panther offense was ineffective, getting off just eight shots, with only two of them on goal - one by senior Carmen Lopez and the other by Tamara Kochen.

FIU (0-1) looks to rebound this Friday in Oxford, MS. against  Ole Miss.

Two school records were broken  on Aug. 30 as the Golden Panthers earned a three-way share of the Springhill Suites Invitational title.

FIU defeated host Charlotte 3-2 on Friday night, then split games with Akron and Western Carolina on Saturday. FIU fell to Akron 3-1 in the early game on Saturday, but rebounded by beating Western Carolina 3-2 later in the day to finish the tournament at 2-1. 

FIU, Akron, and Charlotte all finished the tournament 2-1 for a share of the championship.

Senior Betsy Moreland set a Golden Panther record with 73 assists in a match against Western Carolina, breaking Elizabeth Baldwin's record of 72 set against FAU on Sept. 12, 2000.

Senior Jennifer Owens broke the school's career block assist record against Akron. Owens now has 258 career block assists.

Two Golden Panthers, seniors Betsy Moreland and Julie Doan, were selected to the all-tournament team.

Doan recorded a career-high 26 kills against Western Carolina, breaking her personal record of 15 set just one night before against Charlotte.

Doan and Moreland led the team in assists and kills in each of the three games. Doan recorded 53 kills in 107 attempts. Moreland added 158 assists over the weekend.

Owens tallied 35 kills during the tournament while senior Jessica Jones recorded 32.

FIU hosts USF Sunday, Sept. 7, in its home opener at 1 p.m.

Headline: Men's soccer falls hard to SMU
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Things looked to be set for FIU on opening night.

A home crowd of 641 fans and a rematch against a Southern Methodist team that eliminated the Golden Panthers from the playoffs last year were in place. 

More importantly, a rematch at University Park (where FIU was a perfect 10-0 last season), seemed to be the perfect setting to avenge last year's defeat.

But it was all wiped away within two minutes and 31 seconds.

SMU managed to score three goals in less than three minutes just before halftime, triggering an uphill climb for FIU that was too much to overcome as the Golden Panthers lost to the Mustangs 4-2 on Aug. 29.

"We were even with them and then we fell asleep in the last five minutes of the first half," said senior John Pulido. 

"But it's hard to pick up three goals," he added.

FIU seemed in control the first 30 minutes of the game, but failed to capitalize against an undersized SMU team.

SMU fought back near the end of the first half, and scored when midfielder Jay Needham redirected a corner kick from Ramon Nunez into the right corner of the net in the 39th minute to give the Mustangs the early 1-0 lead.

Just a minute and ten seconds later, SMU's David Chun scored another goal to increase the lead to 2-0.

A dazed FIU team then allowed another goal to SMU's Adam Robertson just 1:18 later, making the score 3-0.

"In the last five minutes of the first half, they scored three goals," said Mario Franca. "We wanted to come out hard but we just weren't paying attention."

It was obvious FIU wasn't in the game. The team looked unfocused throughout the 2:31 SMU scoring outburst.

It wasn't until the second half that FIU decided to turn up the heat. But FIU lost Oscar Gil and had to play shorthanded.

Gil was given a red card after throwing an elbow out of frustration after a foul was called against him.

But even though FIU was forced to play the rest of the game a man down, the ejection seemed to spark the team.

Billy Boswell attempted a penalty kick midway through the second half, but it was blocked by SMU goalkeeper T.J. Tomasso.  

Just minutes later, Pulido had his chance against Tomasso on a penalty kick, but his shot was blocked as well. However, Pulido was able to score on the rebound, cutting the SMU lead to 3-1 at 58:11.

But the Mustangs struck again at 85:51 when Ryan Latham ripped a shot past FIU starting goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg from 12 yards out.

Franca scored the first goal of his career in the 90th minute off an assist from Lucas Scudeler and Fernando Plentz, to cut the lead to 4-2, which was how the game would end.

FIU (0-1) was outshot 25-13 by the Mustangs.

Said head coach Karl Kremser on the loss: "I was very disappointed in the first half. It seemed like we were just late on everything and then in the last five minutes [of the first half] we just went to sleep."

Headline: Commentary: FIU could, should have defeated SMU
Author: Nasser Khalil/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Friday night's highly anticipated rematch against SMU was supposed to be Karl Kremser and company's chance to get back at the team that stole FIU's season a year ago.

This time, the Golden Panthers were not on the road in Dallas, Tx. They were at home, a place they went 10-0 last season.

However, you wouldn't have been able to notice FIU was the home team, as they looked unorganized, confused and lost throughout much of the first half.

You would think 641 fans and a top tier opponent would be enough incentive for the FIU players to come out hungry. 

But FIU looked anything but hungry, which is exactly why they lost.

FIU was bigger, older and more talented than their SMU counterparts. When you're bigger, older and more talented than the opposing team, and allow three goals within two minutes and thirty seconds, something is seriously wrong.

The Golden Panthers lacked aggressiveness and intensity throughout the first half, and it wasn't until one of the team's leaders, Oscar Gil, was ejected that FIU decided to get its act together.

In the early stages of the game, FIU played better than SMU. However, when the Mustangs gained possession, FIU was reluctant to apply pressure to the Mustangs, allowing SMU, which is clearly not a better team than FIU, to gain confidence in the process.

SMU incorporated that confidence into a three minute scoring rampage at the end of the first half.

The Golden Panthers played much of the first half on its heals when they should of tried to put SMU away early in front of the big crowd. 

Not once in the opening half did the Golden Panthers make a conscious team decision to aggressively prevent SMU from controlling and advancing the ball.

As a matter of fact, it wasn't until the score was 4-1 late in the game that head coach Karl Kremser got up from the bench to ask his team to push up its attack. 

Why was this same attitude not taken when the game was scoreless?

FIU has the potential to be a top team in the nation. They have one of the best defenses in college soccer and a goalkeeper tandem that is among the nation's best.

Keep in mind that in this game, FIU's defense played well, as did starting goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg. 

But when your defense plays well and your goalkeeper looks sharp, and you still allow four goals at home, something is seriously lacking.

The problem is that FIU let SMU dictate the pace of the game, which is something you cannot do at home, especially in your home opener in one of the biggest games of the year.

There is a simple solution to the problems I saw in this game, and most of it has to do with heart and desire.

FIU needs to realize that is an elite soccer program in college soccer and they need to be the ones who dictate games.

FIU is better than SMU. Thing is, they don't realize they are.

With a little more effort and a team consensus to attack opposing teams throughout the game (not just the last 30 minutes), the Golden Panthers have the potential to do bigger and better things than they did last season.

As soon as this happens, you will see a better, more dominant FIU team.

FIU undergraduate no judge for President Bush's intelligence

To the Editor:

Ignoring, for the moment, Phineas T. Barnum's comment that no one has ever gone broke underestimating the intelligence of the average American, let us consider for a moment George W. Bush's resumé. 
U.S. Air Force National Guard fighter pilot, elected president of the United States, the only person ever elected to two consecutive terms as governor of Texas, managing general partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, Bachelor's from Yale, M.B.A. from Harvard - and an undergraduate at FIU is questioning his intelligence. 
Who says irony is dead in America?

Reader responds to FIU "ideals" column

To the Editor:

Well written article. I agree with all of your points except for the questioning of why FIU established a football team. 
Unfortunately, our collegiate system is dominated by athletics. For as much as we would love FIU to gain the national reputation it deserves for being a sound research university, it will continue to go unnoticed if it does not move in this direction. 
For example, does anyone in South Florida actually think UM is an academic powerhouse of a school? Probably not, but surely some high school kids in Maine or Kansas might. Why? Because of the exposure they've received. 
A more prominent role in Division I-A athletics will increase FIU's national presence, attract new students, improve the dismal student life on campus, and, most importantly, it will generate new revenue which can be used to better our academic enablers. 
Like I said, great article.

As tuition rates rise, where are student fees going?

To the Editor:

As FIU grows, it is evident the concern for its students gets smaller. 
As FIU tries to race through years of experience to reach the ranks of UF and other great public institutions, it misses many, many important lessons along the way. 
 I, like many, pay for this school with my hard earned money - no financial aid - and for what? 
Is this increase in tuition going to give us higher caliber professors? 
Will it assure me the small class sizes that were promised long ago in the propaganda FIU handed out back in high school? 
 Will I be able to park legally without sitting for hours waiting for a space to become available? Oh, wait, FIU is putting in new garages which will alleviate the chaos that is FIU parking. When do they decide to put these in? They construct them in the Summer so they won't be done until Spring. Where does that leave Fall, the busiest semester of the year? It leaves Fall with less parking spaces than before as many of you have already seen. 
There are many things I can sit here and ponder about, like the need for SUV police cars and the like, but why say anything if nothing will be done of it? 
The reason is because I'm sure every student and even professor at FIU feels the same, and I was ecstatic when I read the article regarding the elevators and thought the person who wrote the article was on to something. 
They were on to uncovering the truth about FIU. I'd like to know the truth. I'd like to know where my money goes. Wouldn't you?

Headline: Editorial: Traffic is bad, but it's up to you to avoid the hassle
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Once again, students were greeted to a new academic year by gnarled traffic at Univeristy Park. A flood of returning students and incoming freshmen inundated FIU entrances and parking lots. 

Inevitably, while waiting for the police officer at the traffic circle to open the floodgates and let traffic through, questions arise about the efficiency of the operation.

Why are students forced to wind around and make a U-turn just before the entrance at 107th avenue and 16th street, in order to access the garages from the south side of campus? 

Why is the left lane, leading to the traffic circle, turned into a right-turn-only lane, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the traffic circle?

In fact, why is traffic stopped at that circle, whose very purpose is to keep traffic constantly on the move?

Presumably, the Department of Parking and Traffic have their reasons, which likely include preventing accidents and keeping traffic from backing up into main streets.

But try telling that to a student caught in the gridlock who is now late to class and risking being dropped, with no hope of ever finding a parking space.
But ask any transfer student from Florida State University or University of Florida and they'll tell you traffic is just as bad, if not worse, at those sister universities: UP has it bad - real bad - but it could be much worse.

These problems aren't going away, and ultimately, it's up to you, the student, to do what you can to avoid being penalized for them.

With the new garages being built, several parking lots are closed. You will not always be able to find a spot close to class. Park at a farther lot and walk. It's likely faster than milling about through traffic, and it will reduce the number of cars on the road.

Get to campus hours earlier if necessary. You know you have studies to catch up on, and even if you don't, there's always something to do on campus. Maybe it's a good opportunity to "Get involved."

Headline: Nazi murderer kills priest, goes to trial...again
Author: Daniel Muela/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
As many already know, defrocked Catholic priest John Geoghan (who was the priest responsible for the big Catholic priest molestation scare) was allegedly murdered in prison this past week by a fellow inmate. 

The inmate, Joseph Druce, is being sent to the grand jury in September, pleading no contest to offing the priest. 

Druce, a former Neo-Nazi, was originally sentenced to life in prison for killing a gay man. Later, while in jail he was sentenced an additional 37 months in prison for mailing fake anthrax to lawyers with Jewish names. So not only is the guy in jail for life, but after he dies, he can expect to serve 37 more months in prison: "Wait just a minute there Mr. Druce, just because you died doesn't mean you are out of the hands of the Massachusetts Correctional System, back in your body on the double. We'll talk in 37 months."

You see, child molesters are frequently killed in most prisons by other inmates whose morals condone killing people but surely not molesting them. So, why does this particular killing get so much attention? 

Inmates who kill child molesters usually just get solitary confinement and a new reason why people shouldn't mess with them.  Lucky Druce decided to kill a famous child molester, so he gets to be put away again.

So, what really is the purpose of sending this guy to another trial? I'll tell you what, it's just so that Massachusetts doesn't look bad politically. They don't mind wasting tax payer money, just as long as the higher ups actually care what happens to inmates; If Geoghan were just another child molester Druce would have gotten no punishment other than confinement, and would've been released back into the regular prison population to hordes of inmates who think that he did the right thing. 

But don't think I'm saying we should throw a parade for the guy. The fact is he killed someone and he should be punished. It's just that maybe there's something the prosecutor overlooked. Druce was sentenced to life in prison, and Massachusetts doesn't have the death penalty. What exactly are they looking to do with the guy? Give him two life sentences? Seems pretty redundant to me. 

Not to mention that the tax payers up there will be paying for the whole thing. They will be paying so they can send him to jail again. 

The strangest part of this whole incident is that Druce reportedly has shown no remorse over the incident, and has also been very cooperative with the investigation. He claims that he served justice. You see Nazi's tend to have a skewed view when it comes to, well, everything, really. That's what really makes Druce such a liability. 

The guy really doesn't care what he does, as long as he thinks that he is carrying on what he has been taught: That he hates everyone and that one day Hitler will descend from space in a shiny pink convertible with presents and fudge. Well, maybe that last one isn't true, but you never know.  

They should look at alternative methods for punishing the guy. It doesn't look like Druce is phased much by the whole "life in prison" thing, so why not just get a transfer for the guy? Transfer him to one of the states where "Sizzler" isn't just a restaurant. Like Texas, or why not good ol' Florida? We're known for more than oranges and bad elections, you know. I'm sure that after a while Druce will find someone that he doesn't like (I mean he's a Nazi, they hate everyone right?) and end up doing something stupid. Then, when they catch him, he'll face more than just additional time in prison in the after life. 

But maybe it doesn't have to come to that. Maybe the reason that Druce doesn't really care about killing someone or sending fake anthrax is that he has no fear of something worse happening to him. Massachusetts cannot do anything to him, so why should he worry? By being moved to another state maybe fear of the death penalty will control his behavior. But to keep him where there's no death penalty is just inviting him to commit crimes.

By transferring him, officials could ease the thorn in their sides or just remove the thorn completely through a very high dose of electricity.

A trial will get nothing done and will just send him right back to prison where he could kill a hundred more people and get a hundred life sentences. By looking at alternative methods and not just bureaucracy, Joseph Druce can be dealt with effectively. 

At least I can rest easy knowing that the state of Massachusetts is putting a dangerous criminal away for good, and while hundreds of criminals are running the streets, they make sure to punish the ones that are already stuck in prison for life. They're good, real good.

Headline: Charitable act changes view of humanity
Author: Virginia C. Cornett/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Have you ever had one of those moments when you just didn't feel a part of the planet anymore?  Like some alien visitor in your own home?  I had an incident recently that made me feel that way.

I'd had a long day at work rushing to get everything in order before the three-day weekend.  I was finally heading home at 7:30 p.m., traveling east on the 836 when half a mile from the 95 N. ramp, I saw a car stopped on the shoulder.  No one was behind me so I pulled in front of the car to see if the person needed help.  

As I walked to the car behind me, I saw an elderly man behind the wheel, noticeably shaken, looking blankly at me as I approached his window.  I saw that his left rear tire had blown and he was stranded on the narrow shoulder of this busy freeway.  I asked him if he was okay.  He said he was.  Then I asked if he had a phone with which to call for help. He did not. This man, alone on a highway as the sun was going down, his car unable to move, was helpless.  

I suggested he turn on his hazard lights and put the trunk and hood of the car up and that he should stand a few yards in front of it along the concrete retaining wall for safety.  All the while I was on the phone with 911 trying to get help for this man, this gentle old man, somebody's father, somebody's son. His thick German accent made what little English he spoke difficult to understand. We quickly moved from trying to speak and understand each other to just me trying to comfort him with my eyes and he trying to show appreciation with his.  

I was assured an officer was on the way and I gave my phone to the man, whose name I now knew was Leo, to make the phone calls necessary - first one to get a number for a towing company - at least I assume this is what transpired as the conversation was all in German.  Then he called the towing company but quickly realized he would be unable to explain where he was and what he needed.  He said "one moment please" and handed the phone to me, smiling a bit in humiliation at his inability to communicate.  

With the police and a tow truck in transit, I felt I could leave him.  I told him to stay out of the car and gave him my cell number, telling him to call as soon as help arrived. I felt guilty for leaving him, there alone on the highway with cars roaring past him, the brim of his cap lifting off a bit at each gust.  But I felt I had done all I could.

I said goodbye, pointed to my phone as a reminder to call me, then walked to my car and got in.  I started the car and released the parking brake, glancing behind me to see if it was safe to pull out into traffic.  At that moment, a dark blue SUV passed me, its horn screaming at me with the driver mouthing obscenities and giving me the one-finger salute as it sped by.  

My initial reaction was to respond in kind but I'm a bit slow to react sometimes and the driver must have only gotten a quick glimpse at the befuddled look on my face.  I pulled out, finally heading home.  But I was sick to my stomach.  No longer worried about Leo or his car but about this woman, this beast, who had no other thought when seeing two cars standing still along the highway but to be angry and annoyed that she had to slow down and change lanes.  

Did she think we had pulled over to have a social chat or for an evening snack?   

As I drove, I had hopes of seeing her car broken down on the side of the highway or better yet, pulled over for speeding.  But my own anger went away, slowly I must admit, and turned to sadness. 

 I felt sad for the world, for all the Leo's, and all the children who are growing up to be selfish and inconsiderate and uncaring towards others.  

I wondered how the woman in the SUV would have felt if Leo had been her father or husband or son.  But she'll never have the chance to entertain that thought because she took no time at all to find out what was happening.  She'll never be able to reflect on her actions or to perhaps come to realize that she had been unkind.  That brief two second incident even caused me to rethink ever stopping to help another Leo because what difference could I make anyway?  

Two hours later, I was at home, comfortable and fed, when my phone rang.  A woman with a thick German accent said her name was Marta, Leo's sister.  She told me how thankful they both were that I had helped him and had stayed with him to help keep him calm.  Their sister, Emma, had recently died and Leo had flown from Germany to attend the funeral and to help care for Marta who was disabled.  The funeral had been just hours earlier and Leo was on his way home, alone, from the gravesite, when the tire blew out.  

She said he had stayed later than the others because Emma was Leo's twin sister and he just couldn't bear to leave her yet, had to sit with her beside the grave for just a few more minutes, just a few more minutes to talk to this sister he hadn't seen in 20 years but loved so dearly.  I heard Leo in the background, in his husky but oddly tender voice, thanking me again and again both in English and German.

And now I know that I'll do it again for another Leo or Emma or even SUV woman.  When I can know I've provided a little comfort and concern to someone who needs my help, I don't mind feeling like an alien on my own planet.

Headline: Trustees increase tuition to max
Author: Lisa Cawley / Editor In Chief
&nbsp;
Students are shelling out 8 - 15 percent more for tuition this year due to the FIU Board of Trustees' decision to raise tuition to the maximum amount permitted by the state - a decision BOT Chairman Adolfo Henriques said they were "forced into."

In a July 2 conference call, the BOT voted to raise tuition 8.5 percent for in-state undergraduates and 15 percent for all other students, rejecting the proposal set forth by FIU administration to raise tuition by a lesser amount.

Clayton Solomon, University Park Student Government Council president, was the only trustee to vote against the maximum tuition increases.

"Last year, some students (out-of state students) felt increases of up to 20 percent," Solomon said. "And eventually, if we keep at this rate, I think that we're going to be pricing people out of an education."

The 2002-2003 tuition rates for 12 credit hours ranged from $1,004.64 for in-state undergraduates to $7,987.68 for out-of-state graduates.  The 2003-2004 rates range from $1,067.16 for in-state undergraduates to $9,249.36 for out-of-state graduates. Law students are paying the highest rate: $9,827.04 for 12 credit hours.

BOT members said they wanted to take full advantage of the tuition increases allowed by the state legislature this year because, they argued, it would help the university in its fight for equitable funding.  

FIU is funded less per student than comparable public research institutions and most public universities in Florida.   The trustees, along with administration and student government, have been lobbying for more state funding for FIU, with their eventual goal being "that each public university in Florida should receive funding for its enrollment plan at least equal to the average by student level of all institutions in the state university system," according to The Case for Equity on the BOT's website.

"We have been making, as a board and as a university, a strong plea and argument to our state legislators that we need parity, that we are an under-funded university," Henriques said. "And while I hate the idea of having to put an additional burden on the students in order for us to prove our point to the legislature, I believe we run a risk, if we decide that we are not going to [raise tuition] the full amount that is authorized by the legislature, that it will be viewed as 'well, you want us to give you additional money from the state, but you are not willing to put any additional regulations locally on coming up with the money yourselves.'"

Before the Florida legislative sessions broke in May, the legislature mandated an 8.5 percent tuition increase across the board for public university students, giving universities the flexibility to increase tuition by an additional 6.5 percent for all students except in-state undergraduates.

FIU administration's proposal included the mandated 8.5 percent increase for all students, with an additional 2.5 percent increase for undergraduate nonresidents and graduate residents, and an additional 3.5 percent for law school residents. 

Administration did not recommend maximum increases because they did not want to jeopardize FIU's competitiveness in the marketplace, and they were "worried that our students would not be able to cover the costs," Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of Academic Affairs, said.

However, Rosenberg said that administration does support the BOT's decision. And while he thinks the situation is unfortunate for students, he believes tuition increases were necessary.

"We need revenue," Rosenberg said. "It's very expensive to run a quality institution of higher education, and so this is a measure that enables us to continue our quest to maintain our quality.

"And while I regret it," he added, "it is something we have to do in order to advance the institution and at least maintain the quality of what we've worked so hard to build."

The total revenue that is expected to be generated from the tuition increases approved by the board is $7.9 million, according to Charles Tinder, associate vice president for Budget and Planning. Out of that, $2.5 million is from the optional 6.5 percent for graduate, law, and nonresident undergraduate students, and the remaining $5.4 million is from the base 8.5 percent increase that applies to all students.

But that is not enough to completely offset the budget cuts the state handed the university this year. 

The legislature cut FIU's budget by $3.7 million, in addition to not funding the university for enrollment growth (the new students coming in), which accounts for $7.4 million during the 2003-2004 school year; the total loss amounts to more than $11 million. Last year's cuts neared $12 million.

"The problem is the legislature," Stephen Sauls, vice provost of Governmental Relations, said. "The legislature did not fund the university. Florida is what is called a low tuition, low state-support state. And so with fairly weak support from the state and fairly low tuition [in comparison to other] states, it creates a very tough problem for a university that's a young, growing university like FIU."

As a result of the budget cuts, the university is also taking other measures to cut costs and raise funds. According to Rosenberg, administration is asking faculty to get more research grants, conducting a fundraising campaign to collect donations from alumni, and promoting greater efficiency within the university through larger class sizes, less specialized courses, fewer adjuncts and less courses offered. 

"This isn't just about raising tuition," Rosenberg said. "It's about an overall effort the [university] president has asked us to carry out to maintain quality while cutting costs."

In addition to raising tuition, the BOT also increased the amount of aid the university can grant students through fee waivers from $5 million to $6.5 million. The waivers will be used to help some students who would not other wise be able to afford their education. The waivers are distributed on a need basis and Rosenberg said he expects low income and graduate students to benefit the most from them. He added that he expects most of the $6.5 million to be distributed.

With the tuition increase, which only applies to the matriculation component of tuition, the financial aid fee will also increase as a result of a state law that mandates the financial aid fee to be 5 percent of tuition. 

Some students are not happy with the tuition increases and feel it is unfair that the burden falls on them.

"I know it's not [the university's] fault that [the state] is cutting their budget, but it's not our fault either," junior and finance major Roberto Quiroz said. Quiroz, a resident student, works full-time to pay for school in addition to his other expenses, such as health and car insurance, because he does not receive financial aid.

Quiroz does not think tuition increases are an effective way to combat budget cuts and said at best they are "a short-term solution."

Another student, Yasmine Chaffo, was working part-time to pay for school before she was laid off - now she is paying out of her and her husband's savings. Like Quiroz, she does not receive financial aid or scholarships. 

While Chaffo said she supports some tuition increases to offset the burdens felt by faculty as a result of the budget cuts, she does not think maximum increases were necessary and she wants the trustees and administration members to realize that the effects of a weak economy are widespread.

"The economy situation affects everyone," Chaffo, an in-state junior and international business and marketing major, said. "Just like the institution doesn't have money, we, the students, don't have money either."

All other public universities in Florida, with the exception of Florida State University, also increased tuition to the maximum amounts. Even so, Florida's public universities rank below national average in all categories of tuition except nonresident graduate.

"Education in Florida is significantly cheaper, and I think it's important that students realize that," Solomon said. "But my argument to administration is that in order to remain the school we are, we have to keep that value." 

Solomon said student government did its best to prevent the increases from occurring, even calling a Rule Development Workshop prior to the BOT meeting to discuss the potential increases and give students the opportunity to share their opinions on the situation.  

Said Solomon: "We did everything we could."

Headline: New website promotes dating safety
Author: Lisbertha Eustache / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It is Saturday night. A 19-year-old female college sophomore is getting ready to go out with a guy she met at the gym earlier in the week. All that she knows about him is his name, age, and that he is very attractive. She meets him at the spot where they both agreed to hook up. Yet, she neglects to tell anyone, such as a friend, sibling, parent or other relative, of her whereabouts.

Dates such as this and the ever-so-popular blind date scene are common among individuals who are in the college-age group, where independence is, for many, taken for granted. 

Many young adults who are embarking on this independence may easily forget their safety while being caught up in excitement. To prevent safety neglect, whereaboutnote.com, a web site where students can log on and sign up for dating protection, has been launched.

The website, which is not affiliated with FIU, features dating safety tips, and members enter information about the dates that they will go on, so that it will be emailed to friends or relatives only if the members do not return from their rendezvous.

"The site is more for dating safety. If you are new in town, go on blind dates often, or go out a lot, then it would be very helpful," said Ana Cantalapiedra, creative director of whereaboutnote.com.

Information that is entered by participants can include the time their date begins, where they are going, when they will get home and, if known, a description of who they are going out with. They have the option to enter when the e-mail should be sent out and whether to have their cell phone as one form of contact. Members may choose up to five people to send this information to. The e-mail is sent only if participants do not return home to cancel it before the designated time for the message(s) to be sent. 

The web site idea was created by Cantalapiedra and launched last month. Marcio Stewart is the sales and marketing director, and also funded whereaboutnote.com. He and Cantalapiedra are promoting the site across colleges and universities in South Florida.

"Anybody you talk to instantly sees the idea. It's like a light bulb effect," Stewart said. "Girls like it especially, and guys think it is a fantastic idea."

According to Stewart, there are about 125,000 female college students in South Florida. So far, whereaboutnote.com has 100 participants, mostly female, and Steward says that this is a good number of members because the site was launched not too long ago. 

Whereaboutnote.com is catered to individuals who are 18 and above, college students and young professionals. The membership cost is $7.95 per month, and there are no limits to the number of dates members can go on. 

One feature of the site that Stewart emphasized is that it gives its members privacy. 

"Even when a member comes home, she can delete the information so that it does not get sent out. No one will know about her date," Stewart said.

Many young adults agree that such a website is good to help those who go out a lot and want someone to watch out for them, but do not want a third wheel.

Alice Gordon, a 27-year-old marketing executive and resident of Kendall, likes the idea of having a website to help the young crowd in South Florida.

"This is a great idea. A lot of young people go out and you can't just trust someone upon meeting them for the first time, or after a few dates. I think I'll check out this site," Gordon said.

Some explained that demands are imposed on people who decide to join. 

"I think, for the average college student, it's too time consuming," said senior Neil Nunez.

Still, Cantalapiedra is sure of whereaboutnote.com's success.

"Some friends [of mine] have expressed interest, especially females. I think that in a time like this, it is important to have fun while being safe and smart," Cantalapiedra said. 

Stewart's predictions of the success of whereaboutnote.com echoes that of Cantalapiedra's.

"I have two friends of mine whose daughter has gone to college in Italy. She was one of the first people to join the website. Any parent would want their child who is away in school to consider this safe way of dating," Stewart said.

Headline: VAC promotes sexual assault awareness
Author: Lisbertha Eustache/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The start of a new school year introduces students to different clubs and programs, and FIU's Victim Advocacy Center is one organization that is trying to make their mission known. 

Operating under the guidance of the Division of Student Affairs, the Victim Advocacy Center is part of a statewide initiative to ensure awareness and prevention of sexual assault. 

VAC provides services to victims of all forms of violence, including sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, cyber-stalking and hate crimes. It also consists of peer education programs, in which FIU students are trained to teach other students about awareness and prevention of these issues.

An organization such as VAC is found throughout most public colleges and universities in Florida. The focus is to have college students become aware of physical and sexual assault.

"There are 350 rapes per 10,000 female students every year on college campuses nationwide," said Sharon Aaron, director of the FIU VAC.

According to Amanda Niguidula, assistant director of the center, law enforcement statistics indicate that the majority of sexual assaults go unreported.

"Eighty-four percent of sexual assaults are committed by someone known to the victim," Niguidula said. 

The Florida Council against Sexual Violence (FCASV), under the guidance of the Florida Department of Health, trains crisis centers found in schools and in residential communities to help victims cope with their assaults. For FIU's VAC, the FCASV assists them with the development, printing, and distribution of pamphlets and brochures. Debbie Rogers, director of public awareness for FCASV, said that the program works as an advocate to state legislatures and the government on policies and laws geared to victims and survivors of sexual assault. 

"[The council] works with state attorneys in order to bring appropriate sentences to [offenders]. It also performs bench instructions, which is to help judges understand the problem with these crimes and handle them on a case-by-case manner," Rogers said. 

In the late 1980s, the university had an organization then known as the Sexual Assault Response Team, or SART. As its name indicates, the purpose of SART was to respond to different types of sexual assaults on campus. 

The need to create a program that was more suitable to the growing number of enrolled students at FIU, and the growing occurrence of crimes aside from sexual assaults, resulted in the organization of the VAC in 1993. 

The VAC, which has offices on both University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses, is open to all students, faculty and staff. Campus visitors can also seek help, if they are affiliated with the university. For others, they are referred to the nearest crisis center.

The VAC has been awarded two grants. One grant, in the amount of $300,000, will be used to expand its services at FIU. 

The center is using the other grant, in the amount of $73,000, to sponsor the Sweetwater Outreach Service (SOS), a program in its third year that helps victims of relationship violence in the aforementioned city. 

"It's important for victims to gain a sense of control over their lives, so the center's clients are provided with information and emotional support in order to decide for themselves what course of action to pursue," Aaron said.

The VAC provides free and confidential services to victims of violence and abuse. The victim, if he or she chooses, may remain anonymous. It is not necessary to become a client of the center in order to obtain information. 

Still, according to Aaron, "When it comes to child abuse, elder abuse, suicidal or homicidal intention, by law we have to report this." Clients of the center sign a form indicating that they understand the level of confidentiality. 

Once a victim decides to receive help from the center and signs the necessary forms, he or she is given attention by the advisors who work at the VAC, depending on the individual's problem. 

A victim may be helped by a trained peer educator, a social worker (typically one with a master's degree in social work) or a clinician. The center takes all appropriate action for the wellbeing of the victim, such as arranging for an examination in a rape treatment center, in the case of a sexual assault.    

FIU students praise the services the VAC offers to FIU and the West Miami community. 

"It's good that there is a place for victims to go to if they need the help," senior Vanessa Adams said. 

One student, who wished to remain anonymous, explained how imperative it is for victims of domestic violence to leave their abuser. 

"There exists a strong need for victims to become independent and leave their abuser, such as a boyfriend or husband. It may be difficult at first, but in the end it is worth it," the student said.

Still, Rogers is impressed with the growing number of men who have become aware of the problem, realizing that it affects them as well.

"The programs are improving. Men are given information, which is great, since it helps them to understand their role in stopping these crimes from happening," Rogers explained. "The biggest change is that the state has come together in a unified voice to spread the message."

Temporary parking spaces added

FIU construction will cause a temporary deficiency of 635 spaces to the University Park campus, but will result in the addition of 2,000 garage spaces.

To compensate for this inconvenience, spaces will be added near housing by January 2004, including 60 spaces on the west side of the existing Panther Hall lot.

There are also over 300 unused spaces in Lot 7, directly west of the stadium. Transportation will be provided between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. from this lot to the Health and Wellness Center.

Over 300 spaces will be provided to the land-bank area on the Northeast corner of campus. Light poles and curbstones will be placed to add safety and definition to the area. Transportation from there to the loading area near the OE and Chemistry and Physics buildings will be provided.

All affected faculty and staff spaces have been relocated to Lot 9 (north of Lot 8) and Lot 14 (between Everglades Hall and the MARC building).

 E-mail virus infects FIU computers 

FIU University Technology Services say that they have found out which computer systems have been attacked by the Internet Worm (MSBlast) and the "Sobig.A/B/F" computer viruses, and they are contacting those users to make arrangements to fix these systems.

The viruses are spread via e-mail and clog up e-mail systems, while faking the sender address as it spreads.

UTS says that bounced messages are not an indication of infection and should simply be deleted until the problem can be fixed.

The following subjects are virus-filled messages and should be deleted immediately: Re: Details; Re: Approved; Re: Re: My details; Re: Thank you!; Re: That movie; Re: Wicked screensaver; Re: your application; Thank you!; Your details.

UTS asks that there be no phone calls about the viruses so that they can fix the problem efficiently and quickly. Any other requests can be submitted at http://uts.fiu.edu, but virus-related issues will be addressed first.

Headline: Free math tutoring service available online
Author: Francisco Zuniga/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Thanks to a federal grant, the Department of Student Affairs at FIU is currently providing an online math tutoring service to all students through the university's website.

 According to Vice-President of Student Affairs, Patricia Telles-Irvin, the five-year grant was for $2.1 million. 

Of that amount, approximately $220,000 is being used for the math program.                                           The grant, which Student Affairs received almost a year ago in the fall, has a number of different parts of which the math tutoring service is just one. 

It is intended to provide a number of services to any student in need of help with their different courses as well as areas of campus life.

 Expanding of the Freshman Interest Group Program, online tutorials in English and Biology, orientation for transfers students and peer mentoring, are among the other activities the grant is funding. 

 "The purpose was to implement a number of different strategies to assist the retention of our students, in other words to keep students in school," said Telles-Irvin. "Basically this is one system that we have implemented and helped fund in order to provide tutorial services."

 Telles-Irvin went on to explain that the math program itself was developed because of the high fail and dropout rate that was being observed in certain math courses. 

Enrique Villamor, chairperson of the Mathematics Department, put the idea together along with math professor George Kafkoulis, who covered the technological aspect.

 The program consists of a team of tutors who are stationed live on the internet, ready to offer assistance to any student who is enrolled at FIU in any of the areas of mathematics offered by the university.

 "It goes all the way from college algebra and finite math to calculus," said Villamor.

As the tutoring session is in progress the students can see and hear the person that they are working with. 

"Our tutors are some of our best undergraduate majors, and some of our graduate students," said Villamor. "We make sure that they have the knowledge and are very competent in answering the questions the students may have."

 The students can consult these tutors with difficulties or problems they may be having on a certain assignment or exam preparation. A digital whiteboard allows the student to see the specific problem as it is being solved. 

Attempting to work the program around the students' schedule, the hours are Monday through Friday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.. On Saturday and Sunday it is running during the afternoon.

 "It's definitely very convenient when you're studying and have a question right at the comfort of your own home, you can go online and get help," said Ali Shih, FIU student.

 The tutoring program can be found on the main page of the FIU website under the "gato" link.

Headline: Five fraternities to build houses on campus
Author: Angela Castillo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In approximately two months, pending approval from utilities authorities, construction of the second on-campus fraternity house, Pi Kappa Alpha, is scheduled to begin. If all goes as planned, the "FIGIs," Phi Gamma Delta - whose house is located on the 16th street entrance to FIU - will have the "PIKEs" for neighbors.  

FIU has 23 fraternities and sororities, but only five of these national Greek organizations - Phi Gamma Delta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Mu, and Tau Kappa Epsilon - developed plans for fraternity houses. These organizations are in various stages of the planning process, but most have already chosen house directors, though the building of the houses will not be completed for at least several months. The order that the houses will be built in will depend on the order that the organizations get their paperwork completed, according to Sergio Balsinde, Interfraternity Council president and Pi Kappa Phi member.

The Greek housing project intends to provide students and alumni with the true Greek experience of a traditional college, said Jesus L. Rodriguez, housing advisor for Sigma Alpha Mu and FIU alumnus, class of '96.

"Once the five houses are built and operational, the impact will be immediate and immense," Rodriguez said. "Greeks on campus 24 hours a day will enhance and increase more students' participation. [Greek housing] is the one critical element of the Greek experience that FIU currently lacks.  It is one of the pieces of the puzzle that will one day position FIU in line with the other, more notable state schools, and away from the commuter school image we have worked so hard to change." 

The university has set aside five lots of almost the same size for construction of the Greek houses. The administration has evaluated the housing plans of these fraternities, and distributed the land on a first-come-first-served basis.

"The sizes of each lot are pretty much the same. It's just a matter of location, some fraternities want their houses to face a certain street or have a certain address," John Bonanno, assistant vice president for Student Affairs, said.

According to Bonanno, the overall cost of each house is $1.1 million dollars, and the cost will be financed mostly through building loans the fraternity brothers have already requested to local banks. 

Bonanno also explained that the dimensions of each house range from 8,000 to 10,000 square feet, and will have a combination of a one or two story design. Most of the houses will have about 15 double occupancy bedrooms, accommodating 30 residents (primarily fraternity members) and the house director. Each of the homes' first floors will feature a large meeting room, living room, as well as a kitchen and laundry room. 

In line with tradition, the house director will have a separate room on the first floor, while the brothers' rooms will be on the second. 

John Bonanno made clear that the director of each house will not be an undergraduate student, but rather a graduate student or a founding member of a fraternity, who should not only be able to manage the house and maintain order, but also impart helpful residential life skills. 

"In exchange for this professional person, who could be a female or male, providing the service of that function, he [or she] may live at the house for free and even receive a small salary," he said. 

Bonanno added that some fraternities have elaborated a preliminary, but not official, list of the future residents, but such lists are subject to change depending upon the length of time for construction.

"We have a preliminary list of 35 brothers who have expressed an interest in being one of our house's inaugural residents, but once our official sign-up period begins after ground breaking, this number is certain to change; some names will be added and some names will be deleted," Rodriguez said. "Construction is expected to take eight months if not longer. We anticipate therefore that with an eight-month lead time (at minimum) that we will generate enough interest to break even, if not operate at a profit, from day one," he said.

The estimated four-month semester rate for living in these houses will vary from $1,500 to $2,000, as in the case of the FIJI house. Those rates are lower than those of some other current on-campus residences at FIU.

The PIKEs will be ready to move to their brand new house in Fall 2004 given that the building process will take from nine to 12 months. 

 	The construction of the house will begin within two months only if the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity obtains the approval from the Fire Marshall and the WASA (Water and Sewerage Authority) which makes sure the house will be fire-safe, and have high-quality water and wastewater services. 

In case the housing project fails to reach the conditions imposed by these two departments of Miami-Dade County, the project will have to be resubmitted, and again wait for approval.

Headline: Tales from a rookie disc jockey
Author: Krystal Alvarez/ Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Who doesn't dabble in the art of make- believe as a little kid? 

I imagined I was an astronaut levitating in my gravity-less ship, sailing into the depths of space. 

I dreamt I was a ballerina tiptoeing all around stage, with grace and beauty that only God Himself could surpass. 

But most of all, I remember hanging a rope to the top of my bunk bed and tying a mic to it, only dreaming that I could one day be a radio disc jockey for WRGP, Radiate 88. 

Okay, so I'm exaggerating a tad, but I did think that being a DJ would be so cool. I was right; I am cool!

I know that sounds very self-indulgent, but it is incredibly awesome. Sitting in a small cramped studio full of dust and CDs has never felt better. 

Whenever I mention I'm DJ Krystal and put on some tunes, I feel groovy. 

Sure, this job is easy and fun, but not everyone gets to fiddle with a live signal, and broadcast every thought (as long as it isn't profane).  

When I'm hungry I can say "Hey guys I'm hungry." When I'm sad I can say "Hey guys I'm kind of sad," and there's no one to tell me I can't. 

I have the power to control a radio signal. For that moment I am all-powerful. 

I am not going to lie and say that I was never nervous and I certainly am not the smoothest DJ, but it has only been three weeks.  

I have had my share of on-air disasters. 

My first day of deejaying, I had my rotation show (a show in which DJs play music the studio chooses) on Saturdays from 9 - 11 a.m. I was very nervous, but everything went okay, except I did introduce the station name as WRPG (The name of the Studio is WRGP).

My second week everything I had worked long and hard to create was falling apart. I would put in a CD, it wouldn't play. I would start talking without putting the mic on. It was as though the studio was mocking me. 

I became so desperate to fix everything I started talking to the equipment. 

I embraced the CD players and promised eternal love just for one song. They apparently listened to my cries and I was out of that rut.

Let me stop being so narcissistic and talk about the other shows on the station. 

On Friday from 3 p.m. - 5 p.m., I have a news show with Nitro and Frank. This Friday was my first week and of course everything was messed up.  

There was a bunch of people in the studio doing A/V stuff and everything was hectic. 

I was so embarrassed. There is nothing worse then messing up on air and being a total broadcast failure; everyone knows that. 

I get scrutinized enough by the media, without the extra pressure of messing up on air. 

I can't even leave my house without someone shoving a camera in my face. 

However, it is so awesome being a new DJ and controlling radio waves, dodging A/V guys and talking about yourself that I don't even notice the negative aspects of being famous. 

I love Radiate 88 and I love myself, the DJ.

Headline: VMAs mark a low point in music
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
This year, I didn't finish watching MTV's Video Music Awards. In fact, I missed the premiere; the only portions of the 2003 VMAs I've sat through so far have come from a couple boring late-nights when couch-commando roommates take over the television. 

No problem though, I really don't need to watch the VMAs at all to know what's going to happen, who's going to win and how funny it's not going to be.

It hasn't changed since the mid- to late-'90s. Each yeah it's the same recycled awards ceremony with the same recycled jokes and writing, the same recycled celebrities and the same recycled music. 

I don't even know why they have categories like "best new artist" because there's nothing new about bands like Evanescence or everybody's favorite clown, 50 Cent. Please. Even the MTV 2 award category is lacking; the nomination of Interpol's video was the only pleasant surprise.

What I have to come to understand, though, is the VMAs are not about music at all. They're not even about the videos. Those moon-men aren't worth anything in the real world and they certainly don't say anything about talent. 

Unlike other award shows, like the Oscars or the Grammys, that have all tried and failed miserably to produce an entertainment-oriented show, MTV is the only one to successfully achieve that vision. 

The awards ceremony is nothing but a fiasco of rich celebrities with fake smiles who get invited to show off horribly ugly costumes and plug new albums, movies, TV shows and most importantly, themselves.

I have too much to say about the music and "artists," if you could even call them that, chosen for winners. I could go on and on about talent-less bimbos such as 50 Cent, Justin Timberlake, and Beyonce. 

That medusa hair of her's just made me want to shudder. I could have sworn I saw snakes somewhere in there. 

The fact of the matter is that the general public cannot like quality music because quality music takes too much effort to enjoy. Instead of thinking about the song and wondering what is it that really moves you, it's much easier to sit back and let fat CEO's with no musical inclination at all just tell you what's good. 

I believe that MTV knows this, thus the VMAs focus more on entertainment. This only leaves me with one question. What in the world is so entertaining!? 

Chris Rock made a fool of himself, drowning in awful writing and really stagnant jokes, no different than the last time he hosted a few years ago. 

From what I saw, Rock had some moments, but generally his comedic quality plummeted just as last year's host Jimmy Fallon's did during the ceremony. 

I enjoy both of these comedians, but they really need to bring in their own writers because MTV's are just not funny. Somebody should tell these guys that hosting the VMAs might be a bad career move.

This poor writing quality really shows through when celebrity presenters take the podium and try to read the lines. It's so embarrassingly awful that they have to resort to other means of entertainment. 

I guess Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Madonna must have been told that if all else fails, make out with each other. I'm really glad I missed that one. 

I must also ask what the hell was up with Eminem and that Crank Yanker puppet thing. Did I miss something? Why was that skit even considered?

MTV also has a knack of bringing out legendary bands or celebrities, this year they could only afford Duran Duran and Run DMC. Maybe it could have been neat to see Duran Duran, but I watched Run DMC come speak and had to scratch my head. 

What was the point? They came out, said a few words about the loss of their DJ, Jam Master J, mumbled something else, and I believe that was that. Cut to commercial. Once again, what the hell is MTV doing? I can imagine somebody in the production room yelling, swearing, and hopefully, firing somebody.

One staple of the awards that MTV has managed to screw up without fail in the past few years are the VMA live performances. 

This year was not surprisingly any different. I would say that Coldplay's performance was the only one worthy of any honorable mention. 

Coldplay isn't my favorite band, but I give them credit for pulling off a decent Radiohead ripoff.

The other performances were just pitiful. They don't even try to hide lip-syncing anymore. Beyonce elected out of wearing any kind of microphone. I guess it interferes with her massive booty-shaking.

 Oh and I can't even begin to applaud the likes of 50 Cent. That guy single handedly stole the entire show,  appearing in almost every musical act and jumping on stage whenever possible. They should've renamed it the 2003 50 Cent Video Music Awards.

It's a bad time for music, especially if you're actually a pretty decent musician. When disasters like this year's VMAs are not only allowed to happen, but enjoyed and praised, I think it's safe to say that the end is near. 

MTV will eventually collapse on itself if it keeps up with this mindless, boring and unentertaining entertainment. The VMAs are a landmark for everything that is wrong with the music industry today and it sets an example to those of us who actually have a taste for music. 

At least I can breathe a big sigh of relief that I wasn't there.

&nbsp;
If there's one thing Radiohead has proven indisputably in its decade-long career, it's that the British quintet loves a challenge.

Two summers ago, it helped break in Hutchinson Field in Grant Park as a major concert venue for Chicago with an incandescent performance. 

The band and its state-of-the-art sound system and light show were a perfect complement for the city's spectacular skyline and Buckingham Fountain on a sultry August night, and the show was deemed an unqualified success by fans, critics, promoters and City Hall. 

"It was, quite frankly, an unforgettable night in an unforgettable setting," singer Thom Yorke says. Undoubtedly, the smoothness of the Radiohead experience paved the way for last month's Shania Twain concert at the same site.

So when Radiohead plays more ordinary venues, it can't help but feel like a letdown for fans looking for another once-in-a-lifetime experience. 

But though the settings may be relatively mundane, the band comes to the States in top form musically, as recent bootleg recordings filtering over from Europe indicate.

Radiohead is at the leading edge of what once used to be known as progressive rock, a band that meshes psychedelic sound experiments and avant-garde electronic textures with rock guitars and the occasional singalong chorus. 

In the studio, they have become mood masters, sometimes challenging even their most ardent fans with intricate arrangements. 

Paranoia and anxiety course through their sixth album, the recently released Hail to the Thief, but there's also a sense of universal longing with which anyone, especially any parent, can identify. 

In songs such as "Sail to the Moon," "I Will" and "Wolf at the Door," Yorke sounds very much like a new father troubled by the sort of world he's bringing his child into.

In a phone interview upon his arrival in North America to begin an extensive tour, Yorke gave some insights into the state of Radiohead's world.

Q. Much of "Hail to the Thief" comes from the perspective of a new parent concerned about the kind of world he's bringing his child into. Are you more or less optimistic about the planet since your son's birth?

A. As I'm prone to depression, I'm very suspicious of my panic attacks and the way they make me feel about the future. 

It's a common delusion that depressed people have about how bad the world will be. But it's kind of difficult not to be. 

In England, we've been going through this heat wave, and I've been waking up every morning at 4 o'clock having panic attacks about it. People are dying of heat exhaustion. 

The problem is that the elite, whoever the hell they are, are deciding global policies on the environment, and they have no concept about the future at all, what the consequences will be. 

They're supposed to be answerable to the people who put them in power, but they're not, because the evidence is all around us. 

When we were making the record, I used to sit around thinking that it can't carry on like this. It just can't.

Q. That would explain the anxiety and paranoia in the music.

A. This isn't something that is with me all the time. I think about this as much as most parents do, I suppose. I just choose to put it all in the music, because I don't want to get locked up (laughs).

Q. The music is therapeutic?

A. It's the same sort of energy you get from being in a march or protest rally, when people get together and all feel the same way about something. 

And you can tell that they've been waiting months if not years to get out in the street and start shouting and screaming. That's the energy I get from music.

Q. A concert is a ritualized aspect of that.

A. It's also quite important. Getting together in large groups of people, whether it's a concert or football match, I used to not understand that. 

But now I'm getting my head around it, why it's important for people to do that. 

Also the other side of it is that a lot of people in a small area who feel the same way about something is a very powerful, dangerous and explosive situation. Which can be a good thing.

Q. Did you ever have that kind of transforming experience?

A. The first transforming experience I had wasn't at a show but at a rally. My first year of college in London I went to a rally against tuition fees, and it got really nasty. 

Police on horses charged on people, and heads got bashed and legs got broken. That was my first experience of the danger of a crowd. I don't believe in violence at all. 

You can be angry, but you don't have to be violent. 

If you're suddenly in a group of people that all feels the same way about something, where it's possible to have a meeting of the minds on something that is not discussed in the media or is part of the general consciousness day to day, it has a very big effect on you.

Q. How do you hope a Radiohead concertgoer will feel after one of your shows?

A. I think of music as a separate thing from what we've been discussing. 

The whole point of playing in a group of people like that is like having the best day of your life, something that is very enriching. 

You come out of it temporarily feeling that everything is in its right place  - emphasis on temporarily.

Headline: VMAs' surprises titillate audience, deliver fun
Author: By Kelley L. Carter / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
It's all about not knowing what will happen. 

Who will be wearing - or not wearing - what. Or who will say what in their acceptance speech.

All on live television.

The unexpected has kept viewers tuning into the MTV Video Music Awards for 20 years, providing good old-fashioned celeb tomfoolery and water-cooler moments that have people talking for years.

Did you see Michael kiss Lisa Marie? What was L'il Kim thinking with that pastie - and did Diana Ross really have to touch it?

"People love a parade," says Rob Tannenbaum, senior editor at Blender magazine. "People want to see the VMAs because people love a spectacle. This is the night where all the freaks are gathered together, instead of the freaks being in different venues, in different recording studios. Everyone from rock `n' roll is going to be in the same town, in the same building and some deeply weird stuff is going to happen."

The spontaneity of the show is also the scary part.

"You put a lot of volatile people in a room and see what happens," says Alex Coletti, producer of the show. 

"The bar is high, and every year we push it a little higher."

The awards are different from the Oscars or Grammys.

"The Grammys casts its net a lot wider. It covers a wider age group and many genres of music," says Coletti. "But we're so specific on youth culture in a way that we can own it like no one else can."

The MTV awards, however, haven't been proven to boost music sales.

"The currency for the VMAs is really word of mouth," says Tannenbaum. "In a lot of cases, it helps the careers of artists in a way that's much more significant than having them sell records for a couple of years. It can do a much greater long-term thing for your career."

One of those moments came in 1984, when Madonna performed. 

All she had done at that point was her debut record, which had sold maybe 2 million.

"A lot of people thought she was just a cute disco-pop singer. People said Cyndi Lauper would have the career; Madonna was just a flash in the pan," Tannenbaum says.

She came on stage in a wedding dress and sang "Like a Virgin," which no one had heard before.

"That was one of the first moments when you could look at Madonna and say, `This is a woman who is so smart and has such a great sense of occasion that she's going to have a long, long career.' That one appearance changed a lot of people's minds about her."

Jameel Spencer, chief marketing officer for P. Diddy's entertainment group, Bad Boy Worldwide, says the show is the essence of cool.

"The show is so on point with what people want already. Everything about it makes sense," says Spencer. 

"This is the celebration and a culmination of all the best elements of MTV, and it becomes that much more valuable.

"There's something cool about saying, `Did you see what Jim Carrey did on the VMAs last night?' There's something valuable in being on the pulse of what's cool, what's now."

Headline: First Miss FIU pageant to be held in November
Author: Asra Jawaid
&nbsp;
Preparation for the first ever Miss FIU Pageant is currently in the works and is tentatively scheduled to be staged in November. The pageant will serve as a preliminary competition for the Miss Florida Pageant, and eventually Miss America Pageant.   

Senior Allison Choban, who has been planning the event since June, wants FIU to be included in the annual Miss Florida pageant, which will take place next June, an event the school has never participated in before.

"My goal is to put on the first Miss FIU Pageant this year so that FIU can finally have a chance to represent our state," Choban said.   Choban has been involved in past beauty pageants, including Miss Miami, Miss North Miami and Miss Florida Coast, since she began her college career. Because Choban is the executive director of this year's pageant, she cannot compete for the title of Miss FIU this year or any future year. "I'm willing to sacrifice competing in order to leave a tradition at FIU because this will be one that can go on for many years. I feel very passionate about this pageant," Choban said. Auditions for the FIU pageant will take place in September. In order to compete for the title of Miss FIU, a contestant must perform a talent for the judges ranging anywhere from baton twirling to singing to dancing. 

This aspect of the competition will account for 30 percent of the contestant's score. Also, she must have a platform, which is a cause for which the candidate feels strongly, such as breast cancer, or abused and abandoned children. During her tenure as Miss FIU, one female FIU student will visit places where her platform will be promoted. In order to compete for Miss FIU, a contestant needs a sponsor, preferably an on-campus organization. All sponsors will donate money that will be used to cover expenses for the pageant. Examples of sponsors include fraternities, sororities, the Student Programming Council and the Student Government Association, Choban said.

It will be Choban's responsibility to track down these sponsors who will be randomly assigned to a contestant, unless a contestant requests to be sponsored by a certain organization. Miss FIU will be awarded a $500 scholarship. The first runner up will win $250, the second runner up will receive $150, and the third runner up will get $100, all courtesy of FIU financial aid. This totals $1000 in scholarship funds. Four of the five judges for the Miss FIU Pageant must have been national Miss America judges in the past, said Choban. "The reason for this is because they've already had training. One of the judges can be a novice," Choban said. Choban says she will determine the novice judge a few weeks from now. Once crowned, Miss FIU will compete for the Miss Florida crown in June 2004 in St. Petersburg against 40 to 50 other young, Florida women. "During the week before the actual Miss Florida Pageant, potential winners from all over the state will make appearances around St. Petersburg and be treated to dinners at local St. Petersburg eateries, all courtesy of the Miss Florida Scholarship organization," Choban said.

This year's Miss Florida, Ericka Dunlap of the University of Central Florida, received more than $16,000 in scholarships in addition to taking part in parades and making other local appearances throughout the year. Clayton Solomon, University Park Student Government Association president, has been advising Choban during her efforts and will continue doing so. "It's our job to assist students in any way we can, and if a student wants to do something for FIU, we're all for that. I told [Choban] that she needed to write a proposal [to the financial aid office to obtain money for the scholarship]. I edited it, and then she gave it to them," Solomon said. 

Student government may also pay for some of the pageant expenses. "It all depends on whether SGA votes to provide her with additional funds," Solomon said. Provided SGA votes to assist her, the organization will help Choban pay the franchise fee required by the Miss America pageant in order to have the Miss FIU pageant.
