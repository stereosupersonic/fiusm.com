Headline: Guide to getting good riddance of bad rubbish
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Assistant Life! Editor
&nbsp;
The following column is intended for entertainment purposes only. 


How to...


So your relationship has come to a stalemate and you've never been so conflicted. The afterglow of extravagant Valentine's Day, the amazing anniversary sex has faded and you're back to fights that end with phrases like "Don't you know me at all?" and "Ow, stop, I'm calling the police!"

So it's time to give the relationship the axe and with good reason. It's commonly known that people these days are getting married later in life (or not at all). Let's be realistic: You're not marrying your college sweetheart and you don't have to settle. The only couple I've ever known to get hitched in college did so because she's never been fond of the term 'baby daddy' and he's never been fond of his father-in-law's National Rifle Association membership.

With that said, here's how to plot and execute your breakup. Let's get ready to mingle.



The Point of No Return



Now, I don't want to sound cold-hearted, love is a beautiful thing. If you're still running to each other in slow motion through the Graham Center, why not revel in it some more? 

Unfortunately, this only lasts for so long. At one point, you'll realize you're allergic to daisies and the mere thought of your partner makes you itchy. 

Metaphors aside, you have to be able to differentiate the squabbles from the deal breakers. For example, let's say you two are grocery shopping to make dinner that evening. An attractive member of the opposite sex walks by you in the produce section and you take notice. A squabble happens when your partner chastises you then flees to the frozen food aisle. A deal breaker happens when all you can remember is regaining consciousness after being pelted in the back of the head with a cantaloupe.  

Granted, the previous example was extreme but I'd like to think that most fights are comparable to fresh fruit abuse.



Timing is everything



Now that you know it's over, you have to choose a time to tell your partner. Some say to stray away from doing it when other dramatic events are going on, but I say the sooner the better. 

Any event can be used to segue into discussing it - you just have to be able to back it up. Choose your words wisely in touchy situations, for example, the tragic death of your partner's pet. While comically ingenious, it's really hard to justify the statement, "Putting Muffin's mangled remains in this hefty bag has really given me perspective on our relationship."



Friend Custody



As two people's lives become entwined, it's inevitable that their groups of friends merge. After a breakup, those friends have to choose a side. You and your ex could pick names out of a hat, play "rock paper scissors" or  even get more creative. 

One way to expedite this process is to hold an auction where your mutual friends can bid on you and your ex. It's an easy way to find out who your true friends are and a convenient way to make a buck. It could even finance a date with a future suitor. The possibilities are endless. 



Exorcising the demons 



Perhaps the bulk of the drama is now over, but lingering ghosts of relationships usually stick around for a while. The best way to deal with your feelings is to deal with them, then be productive with them. In other words, hate then sublimate. 

For example, one way to exorcise is, well, to exercise. There's no better way to heal than to take rage or hurt feelings and turn it into hotness. Not to mention, it's fun imagining the treadmill's rotating belt as your ex's face. You could also turn the pain into something artistic. Paint, keep a journal or even write a song about it. Don't get carried away, though. That's how you end up as the lead singer of Linkin Park. 

All in all, just remember that failed relationships are not worth dwelling upon. Each one carries something significant to learn and grow from. Don't worry, the next potential lesson could be just around the corner. As the old saying goes, there are plenty of fish in GC.

Headline: Play explores loss of innocence in early New York
Author: Maria Chercoles / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Theatre will be presenting Landford Wilson's play Balm in Gilead,  April 6-9 and April 13-16, a play emphasizing the loss of innocence and outcasts' efforts to survive in the New York of the late 1960s. 

Balm in Gilead is being directed by Wayne E. Robinson, acting and movement professor, who has acted and directed in more than 50 productions in his career. 

"We were looking for a play with lots of good roles which would allow many students to have a main part in it," Robinson said. "Balm in Gilead is an excellent play in terms of number of characters." 

The play features a cast of 24 student actors who will portray a range of society rejects like pimps, drug addicts and prostitutes, while 65 other students will be working, in some capacity, on the production. 

"The play has a dark side, it deals with things we don't want to see," said junior David Solomon, who has acted in previous University plays such as Hair and Dracula and will make his sixth FIU performance with Balm of Gilead. "It has to do with awareness of a world we tend to ignore and this is why the play is different from previous ones."

Balm in Gilead takes place in an all-night diner in the Upper Broadway of the late 1960s, where all sorts of characters who usually hang out in the back streets and alleys of Broadway spend the night because they have no other place to go. 

Wilson's play brings to mind the difficulties and problems lived by those ignored by society, portraying their unrealistic dreams of a better life and their memories of a sordid past. The characters face the normal struggles of human existence, regardless of sex, class, race or occupation: the needs to survive, love, attention, belonging and hope. 

Wilson began writing during the beginning of the Off-Off-Broadway movement in the 1960s, which was defined by theaters having fewer than 100 seats and the use of cafes as theaters. His inspirations came from sitting in cafes and listening to other table's conversations, something he shows by using overlapping dialogue and simultaneous scenes. 

"The main challenge was to do the play the way it was written," Robinson said. "The 24 actors are on stage the whole time, so everyone has to know when to come in, when to stop talking and how to concentrate in their own dialogues while ignoring those around them. Different dialogues were rehearsed separate first and once everyone knew their parts, put together. This took about two weeks."

Balm in Gilead is part of the 2005-2006 FIU Theatre season, a program allowing students to gain experience in the field. All theater majors are required to take some part in every production and it took about eight weeks to put the whole play together.

"It sounds very demanding, we have rehearsals Monday through Friday for more than three hours a day, but when this is what you want to do, it's an opportunity to learn and its fun" Solomon said. 

The play will be shown at the Wertheim Performing Arts Complex, in the Studio Theatre at University Park. The play will be showing April 6-9 and April 13-16, Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. 

Tickets are $10 for general admission and $8 for FIU students and can be purchased at the theatre box office. For more information call the Box Office at 305-348-3789 or visit FIU Theatre and Dance website at www.fiu.edu/~thedan.

Headline: Hofstetter gives witty, intelligent comedy for diverse audiences
Author: Jose De Wit / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
I'm usually not the biggest fan of stand-up comedy, however, Steve Hofstetter's new album, Cure for the Cable Guy provides his audience with witty comedy that a diverse group of people can enjoy. 

Before even playing the CD, I was already hooked as I was browsing through the liner.

"I'm someone who believes that artists have a responsibility to educate while entertaining; we have a stage and we ought to use it for something," Hofstetter states in the liner notes. "Hicks, Carlin, Pryor - all the greats made us laugh while dealing with real issues. They told the truth and didn't rely on catch phrases. Leny Bruce didn't go to jail so someone could buy a wife-beater that says 'Git-R-Done!" 

This last phrase is a reference to the popular comedic character Larry the Cable Guy, who inspired the title of this album. 

According to Hofstetter, "Larry's punch lines encourage health problems, a lack of education and racism." 

Though Hofstetter acknowledges that Larry's character is intended as satire, he argues that it ends up validating ignorant attitudes instead. He also believes that Larry is not just an isolated case, but rather a trend in the comedy business.

Hofstetter hopes to reverse such a trend through his own comedy. Instead of using racism, ignorance and homophobia as opportunities to get a cheap laugh out of the audience, he tackles these topics intelligently by addressing them as the problems they are. 

Now, from all this, I wouldn't want to give anyone the impression that Hofstetter is at all self-righteous about the issues he discusses. At no point does he nag or lecture. Instead, he pokes holes through the attitudes and rhetoric behind those issues, a fantastically comedic effect. 

Instead of perpetuating stereotypes by telling racist or homophobic jokes, he deflates them by making fun of racism and homophobia. By doing so, he hopes to change his audience's attitudes towards the intended subject. 

Defending some of his jokes, Hofstetter says, "People get all sensitive - 'don't make fun of America.' How are we going to get better if we don't comment on the stupid things we do?" 

He then proceeds to make fun of Paris Hilton's sex tapes and the regulation of profanity on the airwaves by the Federal Communication Commission. 

Most important of all, Hofstetter is hilarious. I was listening to it in my car while on my way to work and I could notice people at the stoplight wondering what I was cracking up about, sitting in the car by myself. 

Hofstetter doesn't restrict himself to just social and political topics, either. He is just as likely to discuss partisan politics and the war in Iraq, as he is to ramble about one-legged forest rangers and Jewish leprechauns. 

Frankly, any guy who can tear up childhood obesity, P. Diddy's name change and the college dating scene in one breath makes for an interesting listening experience.

More information about Hofstetter, including tour dates and extra material, is available on his web page, www.stevehofstetter.com. 

Hofstetter's new album, Cure for the Cable Guy, is out as of April 4 and comes with a bonus DVD.

Headline: Math departments combat failure rates
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The University's mathematics and statistics departments are continuing to try and find new methods of combating high failure rates among their students.

Currently, the drop rate for the University's mathematics classes is 32 percent and the remaining class cumulative grade point average is 1.9. The drop rate for statistics classes is 24 percent and the remaining class cumulative GPA is 2.1, according to Interim Dean of Arts & Sciences, Mark D. Szuchman.

"The math courses have a high failure rate, we're very aware of that and we've taken many measures to try and alleviate this situation," said Julian Edward, chair of the department of mathematics.  "In the math department, we spend a lot of time trying to think of ways to teach the students better and help them succeed."

Edward noted that high failure rates in math courses have been common since he first came to FIU in 1993.

"This is not some emerging problem. This is something chronic. We try and deal with it, but there's no magic bullet," Edward said. 

According to Edward, high failure rates in math courses are a national phenomenon.  

"I've spoken to many chairmen in other universities, both in the Florida State system and outside, and they all say the failure rate in mathematics is high," Edward said.

Part of finding a solution involves identifying the various problems.

"I think part of the problem is that students have difficulties reading problems," said Samuel Shapiro, professor of statistics. "They can read the words, but somehow it doesn't translate into what they have to do to solve the problem.  In exams, students come up and ask questions. What I do is I read them the problem and that answers the question."

One prevalent theory for the high failure rates in math courses is inadequate preparation at the high school level.

"Modern society doesn't have a great value in mathematics and parents don't put much pressure on their high school kids to do well in mathematics in this country ... that is reflected at the university level when the mathematics start mattering," Edward said.

Edward is not alone in his opinion.  "The major problem I encounter during tutoring sessions is the lack of mathematical background that students have from high school," said Robert Salom, a graduate student who works for the mathematics department as a tutor.  "Once they are here at FIU, this begins to get corrected."

Student apathy is believed to be another possible cause.  

"In every introductory level class that I teach, I ask them 'Would you be in this class if it wasn't a required course?'  If I'm lucky, one student, maybe two, raise their hands," Shapiro said.

Some students, for their part, hold the faculty responsible for their low scores.  

"Professors don't seem to care," said junior Sean Loret de Mola.  "They don't seem to take it as seriously as it should be taken."  

De Mola took finite math in Spring 2005 and intends to re-take the course in the future, possibly during the summer.

However, de Mola also noted that some of his fellow classmates also did not seem to take the course seriously.  

"A lot of people go into it expecting to fail, which isn't the best mind set," de Mola said.  

Another problem for students is the required textbooks.  

"They teach you how to do the easy problems, but they don't show you how to do the hard problems and the exams are the hard problems," said senior Eduardo Leiva,  who is currently taking statistics for the fourth time.

Leiva has also had difficulty with tutor availability. "Every time I come for statistics, they're only here for 15 to 20 minutes."

Aside from his statistics grades, Leiva has a 4.0 GPA.

The mathematics department offers daily tutoring in DM 409C throughout the week and group math tutoring Mondays through Thursdays in DM 409A.  

Live online tutoring is also available online at www.fiu.edu/~gato/livetutor.  All tutoring services are free of charge.  

However, Edward noted that "not nearly enough students" take advantage of tutoring services and other remedies are being sought.

"Our department, and other departments as well, are starting to use Panthersoft to enforce prerequisites," Edward said.  "This is a significant portion of our failures: people who basically disregard prerequisites and try to leap-frog the prerequisite sequence."

Other ideas include requiring online homework, a plan currently in the development and experimentation phase, and utilizing Freshman Interest Groups, where incoming freshmen with similar interests and areas of study are grouped together in their classes.  

"Presumably, since you all have the same interest, you develop some kind of camaraderie. You can do homework together, you can develop some kind of support network. We have a number of these freshmen groups in mathematics," Edward said.

Headline: Relay for Life raises funds for cancer research
Author: Vanessa Collado / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The candles seemed to be scattered in no particular order around the edges of the grassy area between the Graham Center Ballroom and the Chemistry and Physics building and the white bags to which they were tied, sagged awkwardly from time to time. 

However, as Melissa Gaviria, marketing chair of the University Relay For Life committee, stood around the pavement that surrounded the grass, the random order of the candles seemed to disappear, as a word began to glow against the dark of the night sky: HOPE. This took place last year.

This year, a similar ceremony will take place as a part of Relay For Life, an event put together by a student committee that motivates people to raise money to help the American Cancer Society. 

Relay of Life kicks off their opening ceremony at FIU Stadium April 7 at 6 p.m. and ends the next morning, April 8, at around 10 a.m. There is a dinner provided for the cancer survivors at approximately 9 p.m., followed by a special ceremony called the Luminaria ceremony.

Many volunteers from FIU, as well as the South Florida community, help support the event by forming teams. The day of the event, each team provides a different fundraisers such as food, drinks, dunk tanks and bounce houses, according to Yalitza Gonzalez, events chair of the UP Relay For Life committee.  

These volunteers include fraternity and sorority organizations, faculty associations such as Division of Student Affairs, sports clubs such as golf and volleyball, housing residents students and family teams.  Anyone can attend and admission is free.	This will be FIU's second year conducting the event, since last year when Marly Quincoces, the first community representative for the University Park Relay For Life committee, brought the event to life. 

Relay For Life is a year-round event that is continuously raising money for the American Cancer Society in order to provide for patient services, trainings and research. Money is raised nationwide in different ways, whether it is through bake sales, car washes, canning (fundraising money at street intersections) or accepting donations. 

Once a year FIU has an overnight event, Super Hope Bowl, where teams of people walk for 18 hours around the FIU Stadium track in honor of any one who has died of cancer, survived cancer, or is currently battling cancer. 

"It's [called] Relay for Life because it's around the track and you have to be walking for all 18 hours; one person from each team is always on the track," Gaviria said.  

"The committee's goal this year is to have 40 teams of seven to 10 people, 40 survivors, and raise $40,000."

During the Luminaria ceremony, white bags filled with sand each containing a lit candle with a survivors name written on the front, will be organized onto the stadium's bleachers to form the word HOPE, which is the overall theme for the American Cancer Society.  

Also, family and friends of the survivors, as well as the survivors themselves, will speak about how cancer has affected their life, read poems and pray. 

"We honor our cancer survivors, those who have either battled through cancer or are currently battling through it," Gonzalez said.  "It is also a time to remember those who have not survived the fight against cancer."

At the end of the Luminaria ceremony, the walking lasts until the next morning. 

"It's an amazing experience," Gaviria said. "I've been doing this for two years and have met so many survivors. They come to me looking for hope and I give it to them by telling them I'm doing my best."

Marianna De Michele, survivor chair of the University Relay For Life committee, as well as a cancer survivor, said, "I benefited from Relay For Life since I'm a cancer survivor and the money raised helped my family and me financially. That is why I joined this committee: to contribute what they have contributed to me."

Headline: SUN BELT SWEEP
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The baseball team improved its Sun Belt Conference record to 5-1 after a three-game sweep of New Orleans March 31-April 2 at University Park Stadium.

The sweep improves FIU's overall record to 24-10 as the team amassed a combined 27 runs and 35 hits. The Privateers even their season record to 15-15 (2-4 SBC).

The Golden Panthers will travel to Mobile, Ala. and continue conference play against South Alabama with a three-game series April 7-9.



FIU 10, UNO 4



Despite trailing 2-1 early in the game, the Golden Panthers scored four runs in the second inning to take the lead for good.

FIU starter Walker Whitley pitched eight innings of work, allowed four runs (two earned) and struck out six batters to improve his record to 7-2 on the season.

FIU was led offensively by redshirt junior Bryan Pullin, who went 4-for-5 with an RBI and four runs scored, and sophomore James McOwen, who went 3-for-4 with a homerun and five RBI.

The Golden Panthers entered the bottom of the second inning trailing 2-1, but after sending nine batters to the plate and scoring four runs - highlighted by a two-RBI single from McOwen - they never trailed again.

McOwen would add more insurance in the fourth inning with a two-run homerun to make the score 7-2.

In the sixth inning, the Privateers recorded back-to-back doubles to cut the lead 7-3

In the home half of the inning, catcher Luis Bautisa's two-RBI double made the score 9-3.

Both teams scored a run in the eighth inning.

Senior Frank Gonzalez came on to pitch the ninth inning for FIU and, despite walking two batters, ended the game with a strikeout.



FIU 10, UNO 4



Senior Nick Cadena and freshmen Alex Alfonso and Chris Rey recorded two hits each and combined for four RBI in FIU's second consecutive 10-4 win.

Starting pitcher Kyle Preshong went a season-high seven innings to earn the win and improve his record to 4-2 on the season. The sophomore allowed three runs and four hits, walked three and struck out three.

Relievers Eric Horstmann and Gonzalez pitched the eighth and ninth inning, respectively, allowing one unearned run.

The Golden Panthers entered the bottom of the second trailing 1-0, but scored three runs to take the lead for good off an RBI sacrifice fly by Cody Jacbos and a two-RBI single from Alfonso, and added another run in the third.

The closest the Privateers got was 4-3, after two runs in the sixth inning, but saw their chances slip away when FIU blew the game open with a five-run seventh inning - which they sent 10 batters to the plate and highlighted by a two-RBI single from Cadena.



FIU 7, UNO 5



For the third straight game, FIU overcame an early, minor deficit to take the lead for good and complete the sweep of New Orleans.

FIU starter Chris Siebenaler almost pitched a complete game, going eight and two-third innings, allowing five runs (one earned), stricking out seven and walking three.

Gonzalez pitched the final one-third of an inning to stop a UNO rally and get the save.

Senior Michael Lopez went 3-for-4 with a double and an RBI. McOwen and Cadena each went 2-for-4 with an RBI.

Trailing 1-0 early on, the Golden Panthers scored three runs in the bottom of the second - highlighted by RBI single from Alfonso and Lopez - to take the lead for good.

FIU added one run in each of the fourth and fifth innings and two runs in the sixth to take a 7-1 lead.

In the ninth inning, Siebenaler had two outs on the board before the Privateers mounted a rally and scored four unearned runs, including a bases-clearing double off the wall in left centerfield.

Gonzalez came in to pitch, getting a fly out to end the game and earn his third save of the season.

Headline: NFL shows no fun with excessive celebration penalty
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
By Xavier Villarmarzo

Sports Editor



With the Major League Baseball season already underway, it's hard to believe the NFL can still make headlines even though its season doesn't begin until August, but they do. And for the most ridiculous reasons.

First, there was the whole issue with the collective bargaining agreement, which no one fully understood. By the time it was resolved, people who thought they were beginning to understand were even more confused.

Then the whole "Where will Terrell Owens go?" saga took the media's attention for a bit, as well as "Daunte Culpepper is a Miami Dolphin."

I don't like to get caught up in the B.S. of the NFL during its off-season, but when it was announced last week that touchdown celebrations with props were going to be penalized, I was horribly wound up.

I hate to over use a pun, but the NFL definitely stands for the No Fun League.

These excessive touchdowns celebrations became the most entertaining subplot of the NFL season. Last year, the celebrator who used a prop would be fined and that I can understand. Organized group celebrations were also fined and that I can understand as well. 

But now, the league will not just fine the player or players involved, it wants to penalize the team with a 15-yard penalty to be enforced on the ensuing kick-off.

That is what I find ridiculous. The NFL, which thrives because it is a well-run business, is making an extremely poor business decision by trying to stop this from happening.

Every since T.O. whipped out that Sharpie on "Monday Night Football," showboat wide receivers have tried to one-up each other every time they get into the end zone. I can only speak for myself, but the anticipation to what Chad Johnson or Joe Horn were going to do next had me watching games I would normally never watch.

From hiding a cell phone under the goal post, to putting the football with a pylon, there were times I thought there was no way anyone to could top this or that.

So if the league's plan is to reduce theses attempts, and if it's successful, then I'll stick to watching my home team - I'm sure others will do the same.

Although, there is a possibility that these entertaining showboats will try and stay ahead of the game and come up with exciting loopholes.

In a recent interview with ESPN, Johnson said he was going to get together with Owens and Steve Smith and devise a plan of action to the league's new policy.

There's no question these guys are creative, but I don't know how they will top their previous feats with these new restriction that might penalize their teams as well. All I know is that instead of watching a live Bengal's game to see what Johnson's devised, I'll wait for the first "Sports Center" highlight that documents it.

As for the NFL itself, many columnists and analyst believe there is an underlying racist ruling - old uptight white men telling brash young black men what to do.

But in reality, the NFL wants to keep the respect in the game, which is a poppy cock reason because there is no way Johnson, T.O. and these other guys can be respecting a game that pays them millions - or so I'd like to think.

Excessive touchdown celebrations are the way of the future; the same as spiking the football was the way of the future back then. Just like with everything on Earth, this is a natural evolution, so the NFL is going to have to get with the times. If the Catholic Church can do it, I'm sure the NFL will give in.

And it'll be Johnson's job to do so.

Subheadline: North Korea does not pose a threat to the United States
Author:  Taehyung Ahn / Doctoral Candidate in International Relations Department 
&nbsp;
I strongly disagree with the argument that North Korea is a greater threat to the United States than any other country (The Beacon, March 27). On the contrary: North Korea sees the United States as the most dangerous threat. Such  threat perception results from several reasons. 

First, the United States and North Korea are technically at war, because the 1953 armistice was never replaced with a peace treaty. Secondly, under the U.S. - South Korean alliance, the US commander has operational control over South Korean forces during wartime. Lastly, North Korea has witnessed "a lonely superpower," the United States, attack Iraq in 2003, which was a member of an "axis of evil" club with Iran and North Korea. 

Someone has made a sarcastic remark in this regard that "Washington's excuse for ignoring the nonaggression treaty proposal [by North Korea] has to be the ultimate in irrationality. It said it would not negotiate under duress. So duress consists of being asked to be nonaggressive?"

North Korea has abandoned its ambition for military nuclear capabilities by signing the Agreed Framework with the United States in 1994 in return for security assurances and economic aids. It signifies that North Korea has always been ready to give up its nuclear ambitions. 

Even right after the Joint Announcement in 2005, the United States has started to put pressure on North Korea by raising issues such as counterfeiting, money laundering, and drug trafficking without any substantial evidence. Economic sanctions are closely related with the U.S. nuclear policy toward North Korea and it might provide North Korea with a new motivation to resume its military nuclear program. 

In conclusion, it is unreasonable to threaten North Korea because that would not achieve anything except making them more hostile toward the west. For the United States to achieve its strategic objectives toward North Korea, it should not contain North Korea, but engage it with a more flexible attitude.

Headline: Bush proposal deemed 'fair'

The debate over U.S. immigration policy - or the lack thereof - is once again heating up. 

On March 27, hundreds of Latino students protested in Los Angeles, blocking two major freeways as they waved flags from different Latin American countries such as Mexico and El Salvador. Earlier in the week, more than 200,000 gathered in L.A. in protest of the newly proposed immigration bill being debated on the Senate floor.

   Immigration is a fragile issue. While there is a general consensus in Congress that tougher border security is needed, this country is and always has been a country of immigrants. This country's landscape - political or otherwise - has always been shaped by immigrants.

     The issue of immigration has politicians split, but interestingly enough, the split is not along party lines. This issue has Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) fighting on the same side and for the same programs as President George W. Bush. The Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Sen. Kennedy is a member, accepted on March 27 an amendment written by the Massachusetts senator which would create a temporary worker program - a measure for which President Bush is an outspoken advocate. 

I believe that President Bush's proposal is balanced and fair-minded. His proposal acknowledges that illegal workers are a vital part of the U.S. economy, providing the cheap labor on which the agriculture industry thrives - laborious jobs that regular Americans will not do. It also recognizes the increasing need for better, more efficient border security. The United States needs to know who is crossing its borders, but with 11 million suspected illegal immigrants on U.S. soil, it is hardly doing a good enough job.

Opponents to the reforms argue that a guest worker program is not a wise decision, as most of these "guests" would not leave once they have arrived and established a life in the states.

"I say let the prisoners pick the fruits," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California, referring to the Mexican immigrants who provide cheap labor for the agriculture industry. 

Rohrabacher is one of more than a dozen Republicans against Bush's guest worker program, something they say is just a nice way of calling what really is, in essence, an amnesty program. 

I think that closing America's doors to immigrants is possibly the most un-American thing to do. This country was founded, built and, to this day, prospers at the hands of immigrants.

In the words of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, in an interview with the Associated Press, "Our first obligation is to bring them out of the shadows, make sure we know who they are, why they're here, make sure we have a name and some kind of identification for them."

 Closing our borders is not the answer to this issue, but people have to realize that it is in the best interest of our country that there are laws that restrict and control the influx of immigrants to the point where our government can properly document it. These laws must be enforced and people who are defiant of them should be punished accordingly, just like any other law. 

People should be allowed to come to the United States to work; but I, at least, would feel a lot more comfortable knowing that the government knew exactly who was in here at all times.
