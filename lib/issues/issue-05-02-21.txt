Headline: Coming off the bench is no sweat for Ferguson
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Throughout the season, the women's basketball team has played exceptionally well. 

Thanks in large part to their energizer bunny off the bench, LaQuetta Ferguson, the Golden Panthers have compiled a 15-8 overall record and are well on their way to the onference tournament.

Ferguson has averaged nearly 10 points and four rebounds per game and is third on the team with 24 total assists. As Ferguson's productivity continues, her playing time steadily increases. With only four games remaining before the tournament, The Beacon sat down with the sixth man, or lady if you prefer, and discussed the season's success thus far. 

Q: What's the biggest reason for the team's success this season?

Chemistry.  We all get along and pull for each other.

Q: Who did you relate with best on the team when you first got here?

[Former FIU point guard] Ivelina [Vrancheva].  She taught me to be tough and really helped me out with my passing.

Q: Is there anyone on this team that can beat you one-on-one?

Nobody!

Q: Who would give you the most competition?

Probably [center] Milena [Tomova] and my roommate Asha [Neal].

Q: How did you get into basketball?

 When I was eight years old I was really lazy and I needed something to fall back on so I could quit track and field, so I chose basketball.

Q: Who is your favorite basketball player?

Michael Jordan-he was just such a great all-around player.  He could penetrate, pass and play real good defense.

Q: What have you learned from Head coach Cindy Russo?

Patience and discipline.

Q: What is the most significant thing anyone has ever told you?

Never quit.

Q: What is the one thing in life you fear the most?

Losing someone close to me; it's something I've never had to go through before.

Q: Who was your toughest opponent so far this season?

Marshall.  Although we won, they were really quick and athletic.	

Q: What's the toughest part about having to come off the bench?

Nothing really.  I'm always into the game and ready to contribute.  All it takes is a couple of trips down court, and I'm all loosened up.

Q: What is the one thing about Malcom X that has made you the person you are today?

He didn't take any [crap]. He taught me to be tough and always stand up for myself.

Q: What is the best aspect of your game?

My penetration and passing skills.

Q: What sspect of your game needs  the most improvement?

Defense.

Q: Why did you choose to attend FIU? 

They seemed like they were the most interested in me and I liked that it was close to home.

Headline: Money issues cancel entire NHL season
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For most people around this city, life is the same as it usually is during the month of February. Hockey fans may not agree. 

Since the lockout began following the conclusion of the Stanley Cup last May, many people knew what would come of this season. 

There was no doubt around the league that the Player's Union and the owners were not going to agree in forming a salary cap that satisfied both sides. 

So, here we are in February. The teams should be at the All-Star break by now, yet not a puck has been dropped and most players are taking their talents elsewhere, mostly to Europe.

When NHL commissioner Gary Bettman cancelled the season during a press conference last Wednesday afternoon, one had to wonder what sports in America, and the world for that matter, are truly about. 

When the National Hockey League cancelled the season, it became the first professional sports league in U.S. history to cancel an entire season without having played a single minute.

The truth is that although the owners, players, cities and organizations want the fans to believe that everything is about the ticket holder, in reality it is a business-a multi-billion dollar business.

Over the last few months, we have witnessed players and owners arguing over a salary cap, mostly regarding a couple million dollars. This is something that will continue to happen for some time to come. It may seem as though a million dollars here and there is a lot, but when you have players making individual salaries that far exceed those numbers, one must ask if it really makes that much of a difference. 

The NHL today finds itself in the same scenario as many sports leagues, both in the United States and around the world. Only a few, mostly the top-tier teams in each sport league, actually make a profit each year. 

This may sound hard to believe, but it is a scary truth and the foundation for the argument is that the owners, who claim they are losing money, are actually making money. 

For those fans of other sports, most notably basketball, who are happy they don't have to watch highlights from the  foreign NHL everyday on "Sports Center," be warned. A lockout may be on the way soon.  

The NBA's collective bargaining agreement comes to a close after the conclusion of this season and, like the NHL, could see itself in a standstill if owners and players cannot come to terms.

One must realize that basketball players in today's NBA make salaries that would make any man tremble, including the team owners. 

The perfect example is a player like the Miami Heat's Wang Zhizhi. The 7'1 Chinese native is making $2.5 million this season. To put it in perspective, Dwayne Wade, one of the team cornerstones and a local icon, is making just over $300,000 more. Interestingly enough, Wang has only played in 12 games this season for the Heat and is averaging 3.2 minutes per appearance. 

Owners are trying to avoid situations like overpaid players making preposterous salaries without satisfactory contribution. Regardless, until the comes that the sports world cares about what they used to care about -- the fans and playing for the love of the game -- nothing will change. Every few years we will witness another one of these lockouts that hurts the fans and the game more than the actual players and owners that take part in it everyday.

I hate to sound like a romantic when it comes to playing for the fans and the love of the game, but that's the foundation in which sports is rooted, and until the industry balances one with the other, we will find ourselves questioning the true value of the games. Not only will sports suffer, but so will our present-day society that depends on them.

Headline: Staff ace overcomes accident, language
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For senior David Asher, adapting to a new environment was hard enough, and then a freak accident almost prevented him from doing what he loves best -- baseball. 

Now, the lefty is the ace of the FIU pitching staff with a 2-0 record and the hope of leading his team to the College World Series.

About one month before transferring to FIU, Asher was out one night when he made a quick run to a convenience store. 

He leaned on his driver side door only to have it swing open. He rolled out the door and got stuck under his truck. Despite having a manual transmission, the truck did not stall out. Instead, it coasted, dragging him in circles around the parking lot.

Asher escaped with 60 stitches right above his groin, a broken hip, a broken pelvis and third-degree burns on his stomach, arms and knees. After a six-day stay in the hospital and negative news from the doctors, Asher remained determined to play the game he has played since he was three years old.

"When I came [to FIU], I had the worst limp," said Asher. "My hip was twisted inside."

Armed with new pitching mechanics, he was determined to throw like his old self. However, this didn't last long. 

His new mechanics put too much stress on his back and he was sent to a chiropractor to avoid risking prolonged damage.

While the team was playing a road series in Hawaii, Asher stayed in Miami to rehabilitate his hip with the help of a  chiropractor four times that week. He said that after the rehab session with the chiropractor he was fine.

A native of Orlando, Asher was slated to pitch for UCF upon graduating from University High School.

Then, he was selected in the lower rounds of the professional draft after his senior season. 

To improve his draft status, he opted to attend junior college. Junior college players are eligible for the draft every year, where as players who attend four-year universities are only eligible after their junior year.

The decision proved to be a bad one. 

He spent the majority of his freshman season at South Florida Community College out with an injury. Therefore, he was not drafted.

His sophomore season turned out to be the exact opposite. The team only won eight games and he was the most overworked pitcher on the staff, often throwing 150 pitches per start. His coach knew that if they took him out of the game, the team would lose.

Asher's performance that season earned him a scholarship to pitch for the Golden Panthers. 

He wanted to go back home and attend UCF after junior college, but the school was a bit resentful that he turned them down the first time.

"I really didn't know anything about FIU," Asher said. "I came down here open-mined, not thinking I was gonna sign here. I was like 'Wow this place is nice,' the complex, the school."

Adapting to Miami's environment was not as easy as Asher thought. 

"It was culture shock. I've never dealt with that where I came from. Everything's in Spanish. You can't order. It's different," Asher said. "Now I have a Cuban girlfriend, so when we go to a Cuban restaurant, she's the one that speaks."

Earlier this month, Asher returned to Orlando to pitch against the team he turned down.

 Asher knew the players on the UCF squad, because he grew up with most of them.

"It was kinda overwhelming to go back home where most of my family hasn't seen me pitch since high school," Asher said. "My mom's boss was there, friends from church, my high school coach and even my elementary school P.E. teacher. I wish we would've won." 

Asher says that, from a team standpoint, he hasn't had a good season in his college career. 

He wants his last season at FIU to be a successful one.

"I just wanna win," Asher said. "The more we win, the more it will help guys out on the team with the draft and stuff like that."

Asher says he does not want to think about professional scouts and the draft. He just wants to concentrate on the season. 

He would love to go pro, but thinking about it could distract him from pitching.

"I'll deal with the draft after the season," Asher said. "I just wanna stick with the season and get my grades up. I've never been a school guy. My individual goals for the season are to be an All-American in baseball and an Academic All-American."

Being the ace for any pitching staff is a tough job, because more than one guy can be a starter. Asher has shown his dominance this season by not allowing an earned run in any of his first three starts, thereby proving he has rightfully earned the top spot on the starting rotation.

"It's very competitive [being the ace]. There are a couple of guys [on the pitching staff] aiming for that spot," said baseball Head coach Danny Price. "As a pitcher, you gotta keep your composure and throw strikes. David has done all of that for us so far."

 As for how his teammates feel about him, junior relief pitcher Frank Gonzalez summed it up best: "When he's on the mound, it's almost a guaranteed win for us."

Headline: Viva la ignorant!
Author: Matthew Toro / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Nowadays it's hard to walk through campus without seeing at least one student wearing a shirt printed with the iconic image of Ernesto "Che" Guevara. 

Lately, it's one of the trendiest of trends for people to wear this internationally recognized symbol of idealism and rebellion.  

I would assume the message they're trying to convey is, "Just like the bearded guy with the single-starred beret on my shirt, I'm passionate! I'm a revolutionary! Yeah!"  

This would be slightly more tolerable if at least half of the people wearing his face on their chests had an idea of what the man stood for, much less who he was or what he did. 

The majority of kids wearing this shirt don't even know his first name or nationality.   

They're content with following, buying and claiming as their own, any exhausted fad sold to them by their equally uninformed commercial role models. 

I simply wish they understood the irony of buying and flaunting a shirt that glorifies the image of the anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist Guevara. 

The last thing Che wanted was to have his face printed on $25 t-shirts, probably made in some third-world sweatshop, and then worn by a socially unconscious bourgeois youth.  

 It's even sadder that such ignorance persists in Miami - the city with the highest Cuban population in the United States. 

Maybe if they knew just a small history of Che's part in the Cuban revolution they would more fully understand the implications of the statement they were trying to make.  

 To many, he is el commandante, a key player in one of the most monumental revolutions of the 20th century and a prime adversary of imperialism. 

Some see him as the ultimate embodiment of the ideals of socialism and a true freedom fighter with an undying dream of rectifying global injustice. 

He selflessly traveled the world, spreading his ideals and sacrificing his own life for the pursuit of universal equality. 

To others, especially exiled Cubans who fled Castro's regime - partially installed by Guevara - he is nothing more than a ruthless murderer, a communist tyrant. 

He killed without consideration and eagerly supervised the executions of thousands of Cubans who were labeled as counter-revolutionary. 

He was even willing to pursue nuclear war to realize his self-righteous ideology of blind hate against the enemy.

The most devastating part about this trend is that the people sporting the shirts disregard the history. 

They're not making a statement at all! The only rebellion I see is the rebellion against independent thought and originality. These people are ignorant and complacent.

This goes far beyond wearing a shirt representing something you either don't believe in or know nothing about! The problem is larger. 

Doesn't our generation have its own battles to fight? Do we really stand for nothing? Are we so uninspired and lacking in conviction that we're forced to usurp the ideological struggles of others to compensate for our own apathy?

I hope that's not the case.  It's up to us, the youth and the future, to take command! 

Do you want to start a revolution? Don't expect to get too far by copying the habits of your equally misguided friends and rap idols. 

A real revolutionary doesn't need a t-shirt to declare his or her stance to the world. Che never wore shirts of Mao or Marx. His revolution was through his actions rather than a petty façade. 

Do you really want to start a revolution? Read a book.

Headline: FIU reaches $11.5 million settlement
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On Feb. 10, the FIU Board of Trustees voted to repay the federal government an $11.5 million settlement to make up for accounting errors within the Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology.

The Department of Energy has been investigating the center and the $50 million in government grants it received between 1995 and 2003.

Although President Modesto A. Maidique stated that the operational budget and donations to the school will not be touched, FIU's plan to pay back the settlement back through loans has not been elaborated upon.

The settlement was issued after investigations found accounting irregularities arising from incomplete and improperly maintained time and salary records as well as compliance issues dealing with equipment and satellite offices.

According to a press release issued by the university on Feb. 10, changes brought about by the investigation will include the hiring of a new vice president for research and a new chief financial officer, as well as reorganizations within the Division of Sponsored Research and Training and the university's financial operations.

The HCET program was founded 10 years ago in conjunction with the Energy Department to deal with nuclear waste and toxic site cleanups.

Seven million dollars in grants to the HCET were delayed during the investigation, although Maidique has said that government funding would once again continue.

As of press time, FIU administrators could not be reached for comment regarding the investigation.

"I deeply regret this situation, and I appreciate your tolerance and patience as we have worked through the various phases of discovery and resolution that were necessary to bring this matter to a close," said Maidique in a newsletter the week of Feb. 14.

Headline: FIU EXPECTS BUDGET CUTS, TUITION INCREASES
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A few weeks after Governor Jeb Bush proposed his 2005 - 2006 budget, FIU administrators began to look for ways to compensate for what might result in a loss of $13 million in state funding.

In the governor's proposal, higher education funds were cut by eight percent. Although Bush  proposed a $61 billion state budget, education is expected to receive only three percent of that total. 

A highlight of the recommendation included a 7.5 percent increase in resident student tuition and a state employee salary increase of 2.5 percent that does not include university employees.

A shortage in state funds became evident when FIU submitted a formal request for $27 million of operation money through the Florida Board of Governors on Jan. 18 and found itself curtailed to $4 million in the governor's proposal.

"We have appropriated money, and we go after incrementally more money and try to see what we can achieve," said Steve Sauls, vice provost for governmental relations. 

The governor's budget proposal makes no mention of special funds the BOG reserved for various developing programs such as nursing and hurricane research, which they had labeled as important "target programs."

Although the difference between the BOG request and the governor's recommendations may seem vast, administrators claim that the increase in tuition will help bring FIU additional revenue. 

"Now, there's a little caveat, and that's tuition," Sauls said. "The BOG did not request any new tuition. President Modesto A. Maidique] has not requested any new tuition, and that's important for students to understand that. The governor has ... requested a tuition increase across the board  that's going to yield a certain amount of money."

Undergraduate tuition for in-state students increased by 8.5 percent in 2003 and again by 7.5 percent in 2004. An increase in graduate tuition is also expected.

This year, the governor gave universities unlimited flexibility when settling out-of-state and international student fees.

According to the University Treasurer Alexander Zyne,  the revenue from the increased tuition will provide FIU with an extra $6.5 - 7 million, raising the university's expected income to almost $11 million.

"The 7.5 [percent] is a mandatory increase," said Zyne. "If you ask me honestly, 'What do you think the universities would do if they were given that option?' - and I'm not just talking about FIU - I would say that they would all opt to go to the 7.5 percent, because resident in-state tuition is very low compared to other universities outside of the state of Florida."

The governor's proposal will also affect other state universities, because the request will fund only a quarter of what the BOG said would be needed to keep up with an increase in student enrollment.

In his recommendation, for example, the governor allotted  Florida State University's medical school $3.5 million.

However, the BOG shut down FSU's long sought-after chiropractic school proposal on Jan. 27, calling it an unnecessary construction during times of "scarce state resources."

Despite the massive budget slash, administrators feel that monies from private donations will add weight to what FIU President Modesto A. Maidique called "a modest investment from the state."

Still, some feel that FIU's positive rhetoric cannot account for what seem to be reoccurring budget cuts.	

"It's not a secret to anyone," said Carmela Pinto McIntire, chair of the English Department. "What is happening is that the university has tightened up its belt for some reason, and it's been happening for a couple of years."

McIntire claims that noticeable cuts have been made in various departments, including the College of Arts and Sciences, of which English is a part.

"Faculty members must pay for copies if they want to give copies to our students," McIntire said. "This is terrible, and this is pretty recent. The university has done previous cuts, meaning that if we want to attend a professional conference, we has to pay travel expenses."

Though some have also questioned whether the expanding construction at the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses have taken needed money from the operations budget, Zyne said that no departments have suffered because of the increase in construction. 

According to Zyne, money for new buildings comes from a fund outside of the operational budget, from a source called the Public Education Capital Outlay, which currently holds $176 million for statewide use by educational facilities.

FIU requested $27 million from that PECO fund,  and was granted that amount in the governor's proposal.

 "It's not like we're diverting any money from faculty support or student support. [The funds] are there for the purpose of building those facilities," Zyne said.

The state legislature will meet on March 8 to look over the BOG's and governor's budget requests for the official allocation of funds for the 2005 - 2006 fiscal year.

Subheadline: Campus wireless access made easy
Author: Michael Haines / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Got a laptop? Enjoy doing your work on campus? University Technology Services has implemented a wireless system to access the Internet at the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses. 

This free wireless access is available to students and faculty at several locations on both FIU campuses.

Although the various wireless access points are free, students are required to register their laptop's MAC address on the UTS website. This registration process is complete 24 hours after following the wireless access instructions on the site. 

There are two necessary ingredients needed to make the connection: a wireless network interface card (NIC) and registration of your NIC's Media Access Control (MAC) address - a number that uniquely identifies the NIC with UTS.

The UTS office is located in Academic One, room 293. The automated IP request system allows users to self-register their MAC address.

"UTS keeps track of the computers of students, faculty and staff who are authorized to use the university's network via the AIRS System," said Yogi Misir, associate director for marketing and customer relations for UTS.

"This innovative system ensures that only authorized members of the university community access the university's network resources," said Misir.

Whether through the university or home networks, wireless users should be aware of some security risks that come with connecting to a wireless access point.

Questions on wireless network security issues are answered on the Frequently Asked Questions page of the UTS website.

According to the website, wireless networks are inherently insecure since radio frequencies can pass through indoor and outdoor walls, exposing the WLAN network to unknown and unauthorized use.

The other ingredient for connection, an NIC, can be purchased from several places including the FIU bookstores. The difference in price depends on speed. 

On Best Buy's website the price ranges from $49.99 to $129.99. The UTS web page lists the NICs that are compatible with the system.

Wireless access is not available everywhere. 

It is available in several of the popular study and hangout places on campus. At UP, most of the Graham Center has wireless access. At BBC, the library and ACI have access.

Most students find the convenience of wireless access very useful and practical.

"Browsing, studying, it works everywhere I need it," said sophomore Mai Nguye. 

While the system may be useful to students, funding for wireless access expansion may keep the system in limited areas. 

"Funding constraints currently preclude the university from moving forward with a wireless initiative that will enable wireless access throughout all FIU's campuses and sites," Misir said.

UTS is looking into alternatives, and a subcommittee of the university's Information Technology Administrator's (ITA) Committee is evaluating short-term ways to augment the system.

"Additional information concerning these efforts should be available by the end of the Spring 2005 semester," Misir said.

For more information on how to connect wirelessly to the Internet at UP and BBC, visit the UTS website at http://uts.fiu.edu.

I would just like to say that the idea of having an advice column in The Beacon is a great one.

I know many people who would take advantage of the idea and put it to good use - me being one of them. 

Many students have problems talking to counselors or advisors because although it is confidential, a student would feel much more secure if all they had to do is send an e-mail along with a catchy name at the end. 

I just hope that the people responsible for the section have the experience needed to answer important questions.

The graphics are very assuring, and I think it should be done in every section. 

I think it's a good idea to have a visual or an actual picture of the editors and designers  so the readers can see who is responsible for the section.

I remember last semester, and many semesters prior, when the Opinion section was the most boring part of the paper. 

I am glad to say that this semester, it is the only section I look forward to reading. The designs are better, and the stories cover ideas and events that students are interested in reading. 

I couldn't help but notice that last semester's editor and designer switched positions, and it could not have been a better decision. 

The Beacon is looking better with every issue, and I think people are beginning to notice. 

Thanks for your bi-weekly entertainment. I am greatly enjoying it so far.

Headline: Social Security's future looks ominous
Author: Paola Echegaray / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
According to the Bush administration, by 2042, when workers in their mid-20s begin to retire, the Social Security system will be bankrupt. 

The Social Security Administration has projected that about 48 million Americans receive benefits. Of the 30 million current retirees, 65 percent depend on social security for 50 percent to 100 percent of their income.   

The Social Security Act was signed in 1935 during the Depression, when up to 20 percent of Americans were unemployed. The most impoverished were the elderly and the jobless.  

In his address to Congress, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed the country's economic situation and the goal of Social Security: "No one can guarantee this country against the dangers of future depressions, but we can reduce these dangers." 

When did Social Security go from an act to help the most vulnerable members of our society during unusually hard economic times to an integral part of retirement plans for many Americans?         

The underlying problem is American spending habits. Many Americans live beyond their means and are constantly in debt. 

According to the Federal Reserve, the average household debt-service payments were more than 14 percent of disposable income in the first quarter, near the highest level in 22 years. According to the American Consumer Credit Counseling, a non-profit organization, Americans are over 1.7 trillion dollars in debt. 

If Americans are preoccupied with covering living expenses and debt, how much is left for savings? Americans have had a poor personal savings rate, going into the negatives in 2002 with only a slight growth in 2004. 

According to Catherine P. Montalto, a professor at Ohio State University, only 44 percent of households with a currently employed householder will accumulate adequate retirement savings.

I am not putting forth a solution for the projected money shortage, but I'm commenting on the high demand on Social Security.  Many Americans have the wrong idea about their retirements.

Their retirement funds are primarily their responsibility, and social security benefits should only be used when no other means are available. 

This brings up the possibility that most Americans will never collect on social security. Most would then ask why they should continue to contribute to the fund. 

Americans should still contribute because they might need to collect social security benefits in the future due to hard economic conditions or other unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstances. 

This policy is for the "greater good," just as people in the United States who do not have children still pay taxes that fund public schools.

Many Americans spend beyond their means, rely on debt and neglect to save enough for their retirement.  

As a result, many rely heavily on Social Security for most of their income. Wrong information about the Social Security Act's original intentions has resulted in a heavy dependence on the program by those who could have fended for themselves in their retirement years. It has also put an unnecessary strain on American workers.  

A general re-education would have been appropriate to alter America's exaggerated expectations of Social Security, but now that the program is projected to go bankrupt by the time our generation retires, we can consider this our fair warning.

Headline: OUR TWO CENTS by Leoncio Alvarez and Alicia Bustamante
Subheadline: Write to us at beaconopinion@yahoo.com! You know you want to get "all up ons."
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Dear Leoncio and Alicia, 

I am currently a junior with interests in becoming a journalism major.

 I am listed as a computer science major, but I'm really doubting that as my career choice. I've thought of pretty much everything as a major, from education to sociology. I've thought of it all. Can you guys please help me? 

Why is it so hard for me to find a major? 

I don't want to change majors again for financial purposes but I don't wanna be stuck doing something I don't like. I would greatly appreciate any type of help. 

Sincerely,
Going through Major Mania



Leoncio says:

Don't feel bad about being a junior with ideas of changing your major. According to Career Services, the average FIU student changes their major around five times, so don't be bummed out. 

The way I see it, follow whatever you would do for free. If you love journalism and know for a fact that you can see yourself doing it for absolutely no money, then go with it. You said it yourself. You don't want to be stuck doing something you're not happy with.

I suggest you make up your mind soon though. Journalism, just like any major, has different requirements you must fulfill before you can take upper division classes. 

Alicia says:

The thing about majors that nobody tells you is taht what you major in doesn't necessarily dictate what your job will be. If you like education, major in it. You wont be barred from writing for or heading an education magazine. 

What many people do in your situation is go for a general major, then specify in graduate school. This way, you have four years instead of two to figure things out. 

Don't freak out about it though. Life will give you many opportunites to try out different professions, hair styles and lovers. The good one will reveal themselves over time.

Headline: Wilco performance lacks passion
Author: John Lovell / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
The moment I stepped out of my car, I couldn't help but think I had mistaken the Wilco concert I had driven to for the Jimmy Buffett show later that weekend. Fat, middle-aged men flashed me drunk, dirty looks while tail-gating at the back of their SUVs with coolers of cheap beer - I couldn't resist pointing out the stereotype. I was struck with more disbelief as I watched an older crowd outnumber the younger one.

When Jeff Tweedy and company finally took the stage and broke out into their first song, I started to think I really was at the Jimmy Buffett concert. 

The tail-gaters were now sloppy; they were in the aisles yelling with all the might and power their beer bellies could muster. Some of them even wielded flaming lighters over their heads. 

Where the hell was I?

I was at the Pompano Beach Amphitheater, and I like to say it's the place in South Florida where old bands go to die. When it's not being used for summer pop-punk festivals, it's where soggy '70s and '80s rock stars wash up.

How inappropriate for a band like Wilco, who has made quite a name for itself in the college music arena for several years now with the albums Summer Teeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. (Let's just forget about A Ghost is Born.) 

Tweedy knew exactly what I was thinking after he encouraged the crowd to rush the stage. He even made a comment about the Jimmy Buffett atmosphere - damn, I love it when I'm right! 

The evening went on, and the band changed pace shortly after Tweedy invited the crowd to come closer. After a slow start, this was most welcome. I can't complain about the band's execution, which was just as crisp as its studio recordings. The song selection was a democratic mix of the greatest releases; it even included a couple of songs off the Mermaid Avenue Billy Bragg/Woody Guthrie projects : "California Stars" and "Somebody Some Morning Sometime." 

I have a rather large dilemma about the concert. All the songs were memorable, clean and well rehearsed. There was something amiss however, and I think it was Tweedy. I felt that the set was passionless and could have used more sincerity. 

The bittersweet songs like "I Am Trying To Break Your Heart" and "A Shot In the Arm" lacked the heartfelt melancholy I'm used to hearing on the albums. The same goes for the band's faster and harder rock tunes like "I Am the Man Who Loves You" and "Spiders (Kidsmoke)," which is the only song worth listening to on A Ghost is Born. 

I think they were afraid to be dangerous and ended up being too polite. As nice as it was to see a chummier, chattier, plumper Tweedy, I would have preferred a more aggressive approach to the show.

The finale was also rather uncharismatic. I would have been content walking away from the concert with some of their more endearing songs, like "How to Fight Loneliness" or "Ashes of American Flags" ringing in my ears. Instead, they encored with a few dull songs for which I could not have cared less.

I was a little disappointed, but it wasn't a terrible performance. Wilco should reevaluate itself and its attitude toward the music it plays live before the band ends up actually belonging in such a deplorable place as Pompano Beach.

Subheadline: Some favorite things by Victor Escala -WRGP General Manager
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
1. Hating

I'm a hater. I hate all the time and love every second of it.

2. M83 - Before the Dawn Heals Us

This album has been in constant rotation in my player for the last month and figures to not move from there for a good while longer. I wish film directors would forget all that weepy orchestral John Williams nonsense and score their films with M83 albums instead. The world would be a better place if they did.

3. Coachella Valley Music Festival

I can't think of a better way to celebrate the end of a semester than by living it up in the desert with good friends and two solid days of some of my favorite bands. 	

4. Zo coming back to the miami heat

While this hasn't been officially announced just yet, all the talk makes it sound as if it's a done deal. Mourning's size and tough defensive presence should be a huge boost for the Heat off the bench and allow Shaq to leave some gas in the tank for another deep play-off run.

5. Don't wake me up

This Sunday night radio show I do is definitely one of the high points of my week each and every time. With very chill, late night sounds, it's the greatest way to close my weekend.

Headline: Career fair provides unique opportunity for students
Author: Shane Howard / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
They came, they talked and they took your resume. This year's Spring Career and Education Fair is now a thing of the past. The Feb. 15 event, held at the Pharmed Arena on the University Park campus, hosted over 130 companies that offered jobs and internships to FIU hopefuls. 

Students came out between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in business attire to speak to representatives from companies such as Carmax, Franklin Templeton, Linq Financial Group, American Express and many others. 

Companies such as Enterprise Rent-A-Car, JC Penney and Johnson & Johnson had on-the-spot interviews. Students queued up to have one-on-one interview sessions with company representatives. IBM, with two locations, won for having the longest and slowest moving line.

Kimberly Clarke, who majors in marketing, is in her last semester and was in the IBM line. Clarke, who is currently employed part-time, said she was looking for a job or internship in marketing, sales or management. She was at last year's fair as well and thought that the companies were pretty much the same as last time, with a few tweaks. 

Government jobs were a huge draw at this year's fair. Stations were set up for the likes of the Broward County Sheriff Department the State Department and the U.S. Secret Service. The FBI station was extremely popular as recruiter Kathleen Cymbaluk, an agent of nine years, left with over three pages of names from students who spoke to her and were interested in working with the bureau. 

Cymbaluk was there to tell students that the FBI has positions for many majors, ones that you probably wouldn't link to the FBI. Qualifications to become a special agent include being a United States citizen between the age of 23 and 37, being in excellent physical condition and willing to be transferred anywhere in the country. 

"We get a lot of law enforcement majors," said Cymbaluk. She also said that people don't realize that students majoring in language, computer science and engineering could all qualify to be special agents.

Christopher Smith, a junior majoring in international business, spoke to the CIA, the State Department and Linq Financial Group about internships. "I wanted to see more internship opportunities," said Smith. "There are mostly job opportunities here." 

Overall, students seemed to enjoy the fair. "With the vast variety of majors, it was a pretty good turnout," Smith said.

Those who could not attend the Career Fair should not despair. Career Services will hold information sessions on a few of the fair's companies from now through March. These sessions will be held at the University Park campus. To sign up for these sessions and to get more information visit www.fiu.edu/~career/workshop.

Headline: METAL WORKS
Subheadline: Outdoor sculptures add color to Sofla
Author: Jarrod Miller-Dean / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
David Hayes is a man who knows how to please his audience. He has been an artist for 50 years and has been amazing crowds for almost as long through his innovative outdoor sculptures. 

"I've always been an artist. It's all that I ever wanted to be," said Hayes.

With his keen artist's eye, he picks up on lines and patterns that an average person would overlook. As an avid bird watcher, Hayes spends the majority of his time in nature. He and his wife frequently come to Florida to enjoy the many national parks and bird sanctuaries.

Hayes sketches what he sees, sometimes creating up to three drawings a day. He then makes miniature models, known as "markets."  Later, the arduous tasks of shaping the steel with an acetylene torch and then painting it comes into play.  Each piece is individually welded together to make a sculpture.

The New England native got his start by sculpting clay, wood and other traditional materials while attending Notre Dame University. A visiting professor named David Smith introduced him to sculpture and inspired him. He taught Hayes that sculpting is more than art- it's a way of life. Hayes later thanked his alma-mater by creating a 30-foot monument dedicated to Notre Dame entitled, "Griffin."

Hayes displays many of his works on college campuses throughout America. He has built a special relationship with FIU. "Circular Reef" and "Inch Worm," two of his sculptures, were on display at the Biscayne Bay Campus and at FIU's Martin Z. Margulies Sculpture Park. Both pieces, currently on display in Fort Pierce, depict shapely figures that look like multi-colored birds and worms.

Hayes's sons, David and John Marc, are his curators. They arrange his work at each show and help set up. David  Hayes got in touch with Duane Brant, director of Margulies Sculpture Park and Dahlia Morgan, director of the Frost Art Museum, to get his father's works on the FIU campus.

Though Hayes's works depict his inspirations from nature, they never seem to quite hold true to form.

 "My works don't take a life-representation, because I like to leave that up to the viewer," Hayes said. "Everyone sees something different. Sometimes they see things that I never would have imagined. Their interpretations help me in creating future works."

City officials called Hayes when they wanted to update the city. He is currently working on several additional "series" pieces to be included in the display. A documentary examining his contributions to the art world is also in the works. 

When Hayes's artwork is lent to exhibitions or is sold, Hayes never gets too upset. "There is always the next piece. Each work has its own individual personality," he said.

Hayes has molded his craft like his steel work.  He has worked diligently for many years to become a knowledgeable and well- respected member of the art community.

"I'm inspired by Picasso, Martinez and Braque. I find it best when we learn from history. The traditions of art interest me.  It helps us understand our own history," Hayes said.

Hayes isn't content to rest from his achievements, because he is a firm believer that hard work leads to success.

"The next piece! You can always make it bigger and better," he said.

David Hayes' artwork can be currently viewed on display in Fort Pierce, Fla., Mobile, Ala. and the Krasle Art Center in Michigan.
