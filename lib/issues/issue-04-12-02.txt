&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers continued their winning ways for the third time this season on Nov. 29 as the team opened its two-game tour of Connecticut. 

The Golden Panthers beat Central Connecticut State by two in a thriller at Detrick Gymnasium in New Britain. FIU improved to 3-1 on the season.

Senior guard Junior Matias stole the show for the second game in a row by hitting a clutch three-pointer with just 1.5 seconds left in regulation to put the Golden Panthers in front.

 Following a missed three-point attempt by Central Connecticut FIU won 63-61. 

"Once I got the ball, I knew it was going to go in," said Matias in an FIU press release.

Matias, one of three Golden Panthers in double figures, led the way for FIU with 17 points off the bench. Junior Ivan Almonte once again found his scoring touch adding 14 points and six rebounds. Ismael N'Diaye added 10 points.   

The Golden Panthers outshot the opposition by shooting 59.1 percent from the field, including 16-25 in the second half. 

After scoring the first basket of the game, FIU lost their footing for most of the first half, and at one point found themselves down by nine, 22-13, with just under six minutes to play in the first period. 

They ended the half on 9-3 run and trailed by one, heading into the locker room at the break, 25-24. 

The second half was a new chapter for FIU. 

With just under eight minutes to play in the game, FIU held their biggest lead at 50-43. The seven point lead diminished as the clock ticked down and the home crowd was brought back into the game with just over three minutes left as Central Connecticut cut the lead to one. 

FIU led until Jason Hickenbottom hit two free throws with 13 seconds left in regulation, giving the home side their first lead since the 11-minute mark of the second half. 

Trailing by one with 11 seconds to play coach  Rouco called a 30-second timeout to focus his troops before the final seconds ticked away. 

Following a Central Connecticut timeout with four seconds to play, the Junior show took flight. 

Receiving a pass from guard Jayce Lewis, Matias pulled up and silenced the nearly 1,000 fans inside Detrick Gymnasium. 

Central Connecticut had just one last chance to score with less then a second left but failed to convert.



FIU 70 FAMU 45



The FIU Golden Panthers rattled Florida A&M from the start, showing no signs of having too much to eat on Thanksgiving and never trailed on its way to a 70-45 win at Pharmed Arena on Nov. 26.

An undersized FIU team stepped up the pressure and held the A&M to just 25 percent shooting from the field. 

FIU senior guard Junior Matias came off the bench to lead FIU in scoring with 23 points in 17 minutes.

After the game coach Rouco had only one thing to say about his best performer.

"He's a scorer and he's done a wonderful job for us," said Rouco. 

Rouco has told Matias all season one important thing.

"If you're open, shoot it."

Transfer Ivan Almonte once again showed his presence on the court with outstanding defensive play. Almonte lead the FIU with nine rebounds and two blocks. 

FIU lead 35-23 at the half in a game in which, the team just couldn't seem to pull away until late in the second period. The Golden Panthers went into the locker room with not only a 12-point lead but also all of the games momentum. The Golden Panthers though undersized took advantage of weak inside play by the state rivals and managed offensive board after offensive board to start the game. 

"Our little guys got in the way, bumping them physically," Rouco said. "That's the way we practice."

The Golden Panthers struggled in the first half shooting just 3-13 from behind the arc. Adjustments were made at halftime and the ball was worked far better inside in the second half. They once again put up 35 points, shooting close to 48 percent from the field. 

The story of the night however was the inability of the Rattlers to tickle the twine. Having shot just 6-26 in the first half, they managed to shoot just 26 percent in the second, en route to it's third loss by at least 25 points this season. 

FIU forced 23 turnovers, including 17 steals, 10 of which came in the second half. Freshman guard Antonio Jones had five steals alone in the second half in just 10 minutes of play.

&nbsp;
After the FIU/Herald Thanksgiving Classic, the women's basketball team stands at two wins and two losses on the season. 

The Golden Panthers opened the weekend with a 56-44 win over winless Elon, but fell short of the tournament title game on Nov. 27 against undefeated West Virginia.

WVU 58 - FIU 49

The Mountaineers handed FIU their second championship loss in two weeks despite three Golden Panthers scoring in double figures. 

Senior Milena Tomova led the Panthers in scoring with 16 points including a career-high four three-pointers. 

The Bulgarian native is averaging 15 points and nine rebounds per game through the first four games of the season.

Things started badly for the Golden Panthers, who managed just two field goals through the first eight minutes of play. FIU shot 26.9 percent from the field in the first half and trailed by as much as 17 points before going into halftime down 30-20.

FIU looked poised for a comeback at the start of the second half, outscoring West Virginia 21-5 through the first five minutes and trimming the WVU lead to 35-34. But, the Mountaineers responded with six unanswered points and a 15-4 run over the next seven minutes, beating the Panthers by a score of 58-49.

Senior Yolanda Paige scored a game-high 18 points with five assists for West Virginia and was later named tournament MVP. 

Mountaineers Sherell Sowho joined her teammate on the all-tournament list along with FIU's Tomova and Eva Makela. 

FIU 56 - Elon 44

The Golden Panthers reached the tournament final with a 56-44 win on Nov. 26 over Elon. Lone senior Milena Tomova finished with her most productive game of the season. 

The 6-foot-3 center recorded her first double double of the season with a 25-point, 10 rebound performance, capped off by four blocks. 

After an even first half that saw both sides even at 26 at the break, FIU's 9-2 run to start the second half gave FIU some cushion at 35-28. 

The Phoenix followed with six unanswered points, but the Golden Panthers battled back and never trailed again.

&nbsp;
It was an afternoon of firsts this Thanksgiving Day weekend, when FIU defeated FAMU with a final score of 40-23 in the offensive juggernaut that was the 68th Annual Orange Blossom Classic.

The biggest highlight  of the night were FIU's running back Rashod Smith and FAMUs quarterback Ben Dougherty. 

Smith became the first FIU player to ever rush for more than 1,000 yards. He had his fifth 100-yard game of the year and fourth in a row. 

Dougherty led FAMU by making the longest rush of his FAMU career, a 44-yard sprint in the second quarter. 

He later surpassed the 5,000 career-passing yard mark in his final game before graduation. 

FAMU head coach William Joe, the fourth most victorious Division I-AA coach of all-time, commented on his star player's final college outing during the post-game conference.

"It's just unfortunate that Ben's time is now, when the program is down and while there's turmoil within the confines of the athletic department," said Joe.

This year marks the first losing season for FAMU since acquiring coach Joe, as the team ended their 2004 run with a disheartening 3-8 record. 

Despite the fact that some of his star players were injured for the game and that the FAMU athletic department currently has no president at the helm, Joe made no excuses after the loss.

Other game highlights saw the monster game of FIU's Antwan Barnes who started the game after coming off the bench for the last four. The sophomore returned a 51-yard interception for a touchdown.

 "When I made it into the end zone I began doing a celebration dance, but then I remembered what happened to Terrell Owens and stopped. I really did want to dance, though, because it just felt good to be back. Glad I could make it count," said Barnes after the game.

FIU was also aided by defensive end Venson Jones' 89-yard fumble return for a touchdown, which marked the first and longest in the program's three-year history. 

It didn't end there as the play was followed by the longest play for FIU from scrimmage this season.

 A 71-yard touchdown pass from Josh Padrick to Cory McKinney in the second quarter. That play was also the longest career passing play for both players.

Many frustrating bad plays occurred during the game leading to what coach Billy Joe called his team.

"Over zealousness to respond to FIU's real error-free football," said Joe. 

When FAMU failed to record the extra point after their initial touchdown because of an over snapped ball, FIU's Zach Davis recovered and ran it in for the two-point conversion. 

FAMU turned the ball over an insurmountable six times, including four fumbles and two interceptions. 

The FAMU defensive line consistently lagged throughout the game, allowing FIU to capitalize on a new school record of six sacks, before the final quarter got underway.

"I'm keeping my head up despite the loss because today I got to play my final college game in the historic Orange Bowl," said Dougherty, who finished the game with 436 yards passing and 87 rushing. 

"I also got to go down with a bang ... scoring three of the Rattlers touchdowns and recording two new records for this school. Things could have been much worse."

At pre-game, it appeared that the expected 20,000-person crowd was mere fantasy but this goal was surpassed when 21,010 came out to watch two unranked state teams with losing records compete in the historic Classic.

Though the majority of the audience was there to show support for their team, that wasn't the only reason people came to the stadium. 

Fans also came out to enjoy the much-hyped halftime show, which featured performances by the world-renowned FAMU Marching 100 band and FIU's Band of the Sun. 

"Big plays win football games and we had a lot of big plays today. Cory McKinney made a big one," said Strock. 

"Obviously, we're thrilled! It's like I always say, play hard for 60 minutes and good things will happen."

It was the birthday present Don Strock was looking for.

With a 40-23 victory over the Florida A&M Rattlers on Nov. 19 at the Orange Bowl, the Golden Panthers snapped a five game losing streak, giving Strock a birthday to remember.

"It's always nice to have something nice to remember a birthday by," said Strock whose team improved to 3-6.

 "Winning a game certainly is something that pleased me very much."

Despite missing starting cornerback Greg Moss and leading tackler John Haritan, the FIU defense swarmed the FAMU offense forcing six turnovers for two defensive touchdowns.

Defensive lineman Daunte Monster had a monster game inside and pressured quarterback Ben Dougherty all game long, accounting for two sacks. 

"We knew we had to get more pressure on the ball because they're a passing team," said Foster, who had two fumble recoveries in the game.

FAMU got on the scoreboard first on a quarterback keeper where Dougherty scored an 8-yard run. 

Kicker Westly Taylor could not kick the ball, on the extra point. Because the snap was long and high, FIU's Zach Davis picked up the ball and returned it to the end zone, accounting for two points.

With the score 6-2 FAMU's defensive end Venson Jones returned an 89-yard fumble giving FIU a 9-6 lead.

After an Adam Moss field goal, the FIU offense finally got on the scoreboard as quarterback Josh Padrick called an audible at the line of scrimmage.

With the ball at FAMU's 29-yard line on first-and-10, Strock called for a hand-off to Rashod Smith. With the Rattlers stacking the box, Padrick changed the play at the line and called a screen for receiver Cory McKinney.

The result turned into a 71-yard touchdown pass as McKinney caught the ball at the line and juked three FAMU defenders by following key blocks by  partner Harold Leath.

"They were definitely focused to stop the run," said McKinney who finished with four catches for 108 yards. "Originally it was a run play [Padrick] went to the screen; it was man on man and that's all it took."

Before the end of the first half, linebacker Antwan Barnes came up big for FIU with an interception returned 51-yard and a touchdown, giving FIU a 26-6 lead.

"Overall the defense stepped up in this game," said Barnes. "Coach Strock told us turnovers were going to be important in this game."

Smith came into the game needing 24 rushing yards to become the first Golden Panther to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards in a season. 

After rushing for only 15-yards in the first half, Smith exploded in the second half to finish the game with a total of 109-yards on 25 carries.

"Kudos to Rashod Smith," Strock said. "He's a very deserving young man and a great leader in the locker room."

McKinney and Smith added the final two touchdowns for FIU in the second half. 

After the game, Strock was proud of the way his team played.

"We're pleased to win. Big plays win football games and we had big plays today," Strock said.

Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
After eight years, the Orange Blossom Classic returned to Miami and FIU took part in the legendary game with FIU.

The game had a 32-year run in Miami from 1947 to 1979 before the game took place up north at the states capital. 

The game returned to the Orange Bowl from 1985 to 1995. FAMU has played in every game and holds a 43-24-1 lead in the series.

Playing at the Orange Bowl was sentimental for head coach Don Strock who played many games as a Miami Dolphin there.

Strock's most memorable moment at the Orange Bowl came on Jan. 2, 1982 against the San Diego Chargers. He entered the game with the Dolphins trailing 24-0 and then rallied the team before falling short, 41-38 in overtime. 

Strock, along with former Dolphins and current FIU coaches Bruce Hardy and Tony Nathan, came out before the game the same way they did many years ago as players.

"We took a walk where we used to come out in by the players' lots underneath the Orange Bowl," Strock said. "And it looks like it needs repairs," Strock joked.

The history at the former Dolphins home is what Strock remembers most.

"There were a lot of great football games played in this place by the Dolphins and we were thrilled to be part of it. It was pretty neat to win a game here as a coach knowing you've won some games here as a player."

Strock still remembers a few things about the Orange Bowl as he noticed his players getting tired towards the end of the game.

"Heck, I got tired at the end and I wasn't even playing. That's one thing I still remember about the Orange Bowl is that it's humid. It hasn't lost that through all these years."

Strock and the team will return to the Orange Bowl next year on Oct. 1 to play FAMU again.

1,000-yard milestone



After sitting out for all but one game last season due to injury, Rashod Smith has returned strong and has become the first rusher in FIU history to run for over 1,000 yards in a season.

Smith finished the game with 109-yards rushing and a touchdown. The senior accomplished the feat of 1,000-yards in the third quarter when he rushed for 7-yards on a draw giving himself 1,003 yards for the season.

The former Miami Northwestern standout has accomplished everything he dreamed off before coming to FIU.

"I had big dreams when I came [here]. Given the opportunities, I was able to accomplish them," said Smith.

Coach Strock says he is proud of his senior running back.

"Congratulations to him, he's a great kid," Strock said. "He's a very deserving young man and  a great leader in the locker room."



Pro Player Stadium next



The Golden Panthers will again play in a big stadium this Saturday Dec. 4, as the team faces cross-town rival Florida Atlantic. 

The game will mark the third meeting between the two teams. FAU leads the all-time series 2-0. The Owls won 31-21 in 2002 and 32-23 in 2003. Winning the game comes with two incentives for both teams; one is winning the Shula Bowl and the second is winning the recruiting battle in South Florida.

The game will kick off at 4 p.m. FAU is looking to add a premier halftime show involving a big name artist. 

Originally, FAU had scheduled Atlanta rap group Ying Yang Twins, but the school cancelled after reviewing their lyrics.

Headline: Casual use of 'pimp' raises questions
Author: Breanna Turnley / Black College Wire
&nbsp;
What thought comes to mind when the phrase "I'm a pimp" rolls off the lips? 

It's an image that has led to controversy over whether it is positive or negative. 

The modern definition of a pimp is that of a controlling man who objectifies women and forces them to prostitute themselves as a means of bringing in money for himself, giving the women a small portion of their earnings. As times have changed, so has the image of the pimp. 

Rap artists Nelly, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg have been active participants in the evolution of the pimp image. 50 Cent's ever-popular song "P.I.M.P." has been heard on radio stations everywhere. 

Nelly has created an energy drink called Pimp Juice and has even used P.I.M.P. to stand for the Positive Intellectual Motivated Person Scholars program he started in conjunction with Fillmore Street Brewery, the company behind his energy drink. 

The scholarship is designed to aid college students, who deserve recognition for their hard work in academics and extracurricular activities. A portion of the sales goes toward his charity foundation 4Sho4Kids. 

The pimp image that most of our parents think of is negative. But the modern-day pimp is a high roller with self-confidence, power and an over-the-top fashion sense.

Deshawn Hunt of Marietta Ga., a sophomore sociology/criminal justice major at Dillard University in New Orleans, defined a pimp as a person who has a lot of females and a lot of money, and is very popular. 

Dillard sophomore and history/pre-law major from Baton Rouge, La., Tressa Thomas said a pimp was someone with a lot of power. 

"Someone who can freestyle poetry that can change your mind about the world and can sell reading glasses to a blind man because his game is so tight. He is someone who is manager, CEO and co-owner of the world's oldest profession," she said. 

The hip-hop industry affects the hottest new fashion. People want to wear what entertainers wear. The latest rap song is stuck in your head because it has been played on the radio so often. The word pimp can be seen as a catchy slogan written all over T-shirts. 

Hunt said he believes the pimp image has helped the hip-hop industry. 

"It has made it better. It  has turned the real meaning into something positive to bring in money to the industry," Hunt said. 

Thomas said it has both helped and hurt. "It has helped the spreading of hip-hop because weak-minded people (gravitate) to things that project an image of wealth, glamour, sex and easy living. It has hurt the industry because it makes artists look ignorant, shallow and self-oriented," she said. 

Everyone should pay more attention to what one watches, listens to and repeats. Be careful when you say, "I'm a pimp." The question is, are you really, and if so, what kind are you?

Raid on Baghdad mosque uncovers car bomb workshop 

A mosque raided by security forces in southern Baghdad contained a workshop to rig suicide car bombs, with seven vehicles ready for terror attacks, an Iraqi Defense Ministry official said Sunday.

National Guard forces raided the Sunni Muslim Al-Yassen Mosque in the southern Baghdad area of Abu Dshir on Saturday, said Gen. Saleh Sarhan of the Defense Ministry. In addition to seven cars pre-rigged with explosives, the guardsmen found 30 rocket-propelled grenades, high-powered rifles, mortars and remote control detonators, Sarhan said.

Anti-U.S. insurgents used some 60 mosques in the city of Fallujah, west of Baghdad, to stockpile weapons and provide cover during a U.S.-led offensive against the city earlier this month, the U.S. military says. One of the mosques was described as a general arms depot capable of equipping insurgents across much of Iraq.

Both Sunni and Shiite Muslim clerics are deeply opposed to the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, and many Sunni clerics also reject elections scheduled for Jan. 30.

In addition, a car bomb had exploded on a perilous road leading to Baghdad's airport, wounding two U.S. soldiers and damaging a military vehicle, a military statement said. 

Insurgents also lobbed mortars near a police station in Baqouba, a city 35 miles northeast of Baghdad, police said. Two officers and a woman were injured.

As U.S.-led forces attacked Fallujah earlier this month, insurgents in Mosul rose up in a bloody campaign against civilians. Security forces found 17 bodies around the city on Friday, and 15 on Thursday.

Last week, Basra police arrested two Saudis, two Tunisians, a Sudanese and a Libyan who allegedly arrived in the city from Fallujah to carry out a bombing campaign.

Christmas tree arrives at U.S. Capitol

A few preparations like a helicopter extraction and police escorts were necessary to get the U.S. Capitol's Christmas tree from Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains to the nation's capital on Nov. 29.

"The hardest part of the whole trip was just getting everything lined up," said Keith Garman, the service manager for Camrett Logistics, the company in Rural Retreat, Va., that volunteered a semi truck to transport the 67-foot red spruce from George Washington National Forest to the Capitol's lawn. Cut down Nov. 2, the tree visited more than 30 Virginia towns en route to Washington.

Federal lawmakers adopted the tradition of the Capitol Christmas tree in 1964. Since 1970, it's been cut from Forest Service land, and this year's is the first from Virginia.

With help from the Capitol Architect's office, Forest Service officials whittled the pool of eligible native Virginian evergreens to one 79-year-old spruce last July.

Once cut, a helicopter plucked it from the forest. Workers tied its branches with parachute cord and steered it onto Camrett's specially built flatbed trailer for highway transport.

The White House's Christmas tree, a comparatively small 18-and-a-half-foot Noble fir donated by John and Carol Tillman of Rochester, Wash., also arrived Monday. First lady Laura Bush received the tree, which was delivered by horse-drawn wagon.

On Monday morning, a crane eased the mammoth Capitol spruce into position on the Capitol's lawn, where it now sits in a poured concrete footing, 5 feet deep.

It'll be decorated with 5,000 oversized ornaments - made mostly by Virginia schoolchildren - and 10,000 light bulbs before Dec. 9, when House Speaker Dennis Hastert will preside over its ceremonial lighting.

Headline: Film showcase explores Israeli/Palestinian conflicts
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Junior Aury Garcia didn't know much about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict in the Middle East before this past summer.

That's when an International Solidarity Movement volunteer did an on-campus presentation about the current state of Palestinian life, which many believe has worsened as the states of Israel and Palestine continue disputes over land.

Inspired by the volunteer and her presentation, Garcia and another FIU student, Pablo Avendano, began a new club at FIU known as Students United for Palestinian Equal Rights.

"I wasn't really educated much on the issue until [the volunteer] came. Then I realized ... I should learn more," Garcia said.

SUPER's mission statement, which can be read on their website (www.superfiu.com), is to foster a commitment to the struggle against occupation and colonialism and to the advocacy of human rights, specifically as it relates to Palestinians living under what they consider Israeli occupation.

During this inaugural semester, SUPER has been showing monthly movies in a  type of extended film festival documenting differences between the lives of Israelis and Palestinians.

On Oct. 26, the club presented a movie entitled "Promises," by Jewish director B.Z. Goldberg, which presented contrasts between Israeli and Palestinian children living minutes from each other.

This month's movie, shown on Nov. 23, was "Jenin, Jenin," a documentary of interviews with Palestinian refugees.

To promote "Jenin, Jenin," SUPER set up a table in the University Park's Library Colonnade from 10:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. on Nov. 22 with pamphlets about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.

"We had a few people who were very surprised and happy to see us there," Garcia said.

According to Avendano, the movies were chosen to educate students and open up a forum.

SUPER is currently discussing the possibility of hosting a forum with other relevant clubs on campus to address issues concerning human rights, other occupations around the world and the media's interpretation of the violence in Israel and Palestine.

The organization has received the support of FIU's Muslim Student Association but hasn't heard from the Jewish Student Union.

Next semester, SUPER plans to continue its movie showcase.

In addition, the club is seeking to bring two speaking tours, "Wheels of Justice" and "Stop the Wall,"  that will soon be in the Miami area.

"Wheels of Justice" is comprised of peace activists who tour the country and discuss the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

"They do teachings which are educational workshops about the conflicts," Garcia said.

According to club members, SUPER has met with much success.

"Currently SUPER has about 70 people on its listserv," Avendano said. "The number of consistent meeting attendees fluctuates between 10 and 15."

Although Garcia is the official club president, she says that the club tries to make all members in the group feel like equals.

"We operate on consensus so there's no real need for hierarchy," Avendano said.

Most of the events were held to coincide with the United Nation's International Day of Palestinian Solidarity on Nov. 29.

According to the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation at www.endoftheoccupation.org, the Division for Palestinian Rights at the U.N. annually observes this day, which is the anniversary of the adoption of the 1947 Partition of Palestine.

SUPER meetings are held every Friday evening at 5:30 p.m. in CP 101 at the University Park campus.

Headline: Contract negotiation angers faculty
Author: Luis Nin / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
A mass of angry faculty members crowded into the Graham Center Ballroom to attend the Board of Trustees meeting on Nov. 23. Distressed over the administration's new contract proposals - which they feel would give FIU's management complete authority over matters traditionally negotiated through collective bargaining - the teachers' union arranged for more than 200 professors to attend the meeting. 

But the crowd didn't last long. After Alan Gummerson, the president of the teachers' union, addressed the Board of Trustees with the faculty's complaints only to receive almost no reaction from the board, the professors walked out of the meeting in protest. The ballroom was left empty, and the board proceeded to conduct business as usual amid a sea of vacant seats.

According to a statement made during the meeting by Bruce Hauptli, chair-person of the Faculty Senate, several factors have lead to the tension between faculty and administrators.

"Over the past two months, I have been approached by a diverse group of faculty members and others within the university community," he said. "These individuals have expressed the strongest of concerns regarding the administration of, and the leadership of, the university. It would be a serious misrepresentation to state that the apprehensions relate solely, or even primarily, to collective bargaining."

During the meeting, the administration presented proposals that would radically change the way contract negotiations are conducted.

According to FIU's teachers' union, which is a member of the United Faculty of Florida, the university's new negotiations would include several controversial proposals, like the establishment of a program to evaluate the performance of tenured faculty every five years. If their performance falls below a standard, management would reserve the right to terminate employment.

Another controversial policy would give the Board of Trustees the exclusive right to determine curriculum, programs, degrees and instructional materials.

Trying to ease the tension casued by these proposals, FIU President Modesto A. Maidique referred to the fact that this contract will be the first negotiated and structured solely by the university.

"It's the first time that we have collective bargaining, right here at the local level between FIU and the unions that represent our faculty and all our staff. This is the first time that we have had that run; it has always been directed at the state level. This is the first time that FIU personal policies can actually be catered directly to meet the needs of this particular community and this particular university," said FIU President Modesto A. Maidique in an address during the board meeting. "I absolutely believe that any new experience and period of change that occurs with it brings along a lot of excitement, uncertainty and concern, but also brings a huge amount of opportunity."

However, not everyone agreed that the administration properly handled the complaints against the contract negotiations.

"Unfortunately, there was basically no response [from the administration]. When the president came after Bruce Hauptli spoke, there was basically no response about the problem. The administration doesn't seem too worried about that; they seem to be more worried about the medical school than anything else," said astronomy professor James Webb.

Administrators, though, state that they have given the faculty's concerns the appropriate attention.

"This board is absolutely committed to academic freedom. I want to reaffirm this board's unequivocal commitment to tenure," Maidique said. "We are not going to change tenure here at FIU. The process is going to stay the same. Tenured faculty are going to have the same array of rights and protections that they have had and that they have traditionally enjoyed."

Despite President Maidique's reassurances, the faculty remains skeptical of the administration's intentions. 

In his address to the board, Gummerson stated that the administration is attempting to remove faculty rights and protections from the bargaining agreement and trying to place them in a policy it cannot enforce.   

Still, despite all the protests and accusations, Provost Mark Rosenberg was not surprised by these concerns.

"This is a negotiation which we would acknowledge is a little more difficult than we expected or hoped for, but it is a negotiation," he told The Beacon. "I'm anxious to see a resolution so that we can get back to the business at hand: the education and training of students."

Headline: Jerky Boys album falls flat
Author: Luis Nin / Illustrator
&nbsp;
Before anyone ever heard of "Crank Yankers" or "Touch-Tone Terrorists," the Jerky Boys were prank-calling hospitals about anal wart removal. Revolutionary for their time, the Jerky Boys were the first to make a prank call album. The original phone pranksters are back with their new compilation album, The Ultimate Jerky Boys. The album collects over one hour and 40 minutes of pranks calls from their previous albums. Unfortunately, the album doesn't live up to the hype. Their humor didn't age well, and the album doesn't offer any new material. The CD simply isn't worth the $25 price tag.

Back in the 90s, there was something unbelievably appealing about the Jerky Boys. Extremely offensive and ground-breaking, they appealed to the anarchist in us all. There was once something down-right hilarious about an outrageously stereotypical Hindu man calling an emergency room because he was bitten in the eye by a snake he was trying to charm. They took prank calls to a whole new level. 

Unfortunately, with the advent of countless reality prank shows like "Jackass," the Jerky Boys have lost their edge. What once shocked us is now old hat. The Jerky Boys' comedy relied primarily on catching the audience off-guard, something it just can't do anymore. Most of the calls just aren't funny. Out of the 51 prank calls on the album, there are only five calls that are still genuinely hilarious. There's one great bit about an Egyptian magician applying to perform in a night club and trying to convince the owners to let him bring his mountain lions.

But that was the exception and not the rule. Lots of calls just fall flat. Some of the prank calls give the impression that the person receiving the call is amused by the joke. If they're in on the joke, it just isn't funny.

&nbsp;
It's that time of year - lots of shopping, cooking and wrapping to keep us busy. And it's a busy season on television as well.

But none of it requires spending wads of money, lifting a finger (just a thumb on the remote) or leaving the cozy confines of the couch.

Here are some of the highlights of the holiday programming onslaught:

Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson further cement their reign as the Sonny and Cher for the new millennium with a holiday variety hour. "Nick & Jessica's Family Christmas," Wednesday at 9 p.m. on ABC, has Nick's old band, 98 Degrees, reuniting for a rendition of "I'll Be Home for Christmas."

Headline: Album marks band's new beginning
Author: Carlos Jordi / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It was about two years ago when Peter Arzeno left his drumming position the band September. Arzeno was looking for a more mature and serious group to work with and had considered several options. It wasn't until Fernando Galvez and Adolfo Dorda came into the picture that he felt a sense of belonging. Both Galvez and Dorda had heard of Arzeno's reputation. They knew he was an accredited and competitive drummer who had held several positions on the Miami Springs Marching Band and the local Miami music scene. This match, which gave birth to the band The Parlaphone, proved to be more than a coincidence. 

Ever since Galvez and Dorda brought on Arzeno as a band member, the band has played countless shows, recorded a demo and established a name for themselves in Miami. With the upcoming release of their new album, First Against The Wall, The Parlaphone seems unstoppable and displays a promising future. 

I got a chance to hear the album, prior to its February 5, 2005 release, and to speak with drummer Arenzo about his feelings on the future. 

Upon hearing the album, I was struck by the band's original style. The first track, "Come On," is an inviting tune with a melody that resembles a Beatles' song. The rest of the album is incomparable to anything I have ever heard. Tracks like "Melodramatic," "Yes, I Know" and "Take It Or Leave It," give pulse-pumping rhythms that are matched with well written lyrics and thoughtful melodies. 

However, half way through the album the songs decline in melody and lyric content. "Just Because" and "This Fish Is Dead" have introductions that seem out of place. These two songs don't fit with the rest of the tracks and dampen what could have been a much better album. 

On the last four tracks, The Parlaphone's redeem themselves with songs that are similar to the first half of the album. "In Dreams," my favorite track on the album, begins with enough effects and heavy feedback to raise the hairs on your arms. The song is very well written and possesses a quality that separates it from the rest of the album.           

Arzeno said that each band member's eclectic taste in music accounts for the band's original sound and solid feel. He explained how the music they create is the result of a mix of different music. When listening to the album, this mix is evident and refreshing. Arenzo is happy to be out of the studio and admits that making this album was a terrific experience. He learned a lot from working with his bandmates and Tom Anthony, their sound engineer at Natural Sound Studios.   

Peter said that the album is a culmination of two years' work, and marks a new beginning for the band. He feels that they have come a long way from where they started and promises their consistent growth.

The Parlaphone remains optimistic about the release of First Against The Wall and continue to play shows across South Florida.

Headline: A bite with Carlos
Subheadline: Local taqueria guarantees freshness and fast food
Author: Carlos C. Olaechea / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's after midnight on a Tuesday, and you've just finished a late night cram session in the Green Library for your physics class. There is a strong urge emanating from deep within your stomach. The urge then acquires a voice and soon enough there's a pounding in your ear: "hungry, gotta eat, hungry, gotta eat." However, having lived in Miami almost all your life, you know that your choices are limited. You have Denny's, IHOP, Starlight Diner and Rey's Pizza. But you don't want to sit down and wait for service at the first three, and you definitely don't want the all-night indigestion from the latter. All you want is a good, fresh, fast and cheap bite to eat.

Luckily, Ernesto has the answer to your problem, and just in time for finals week. Ernesto's Taco Shop (formerly Roberto's Taco Shop), located in the heart of Kendall, is a typical Mexican style taqueria. For those unacquainted with the term, a taqueria is the precursor to that demonic American creation, Taco Bell. It is a fast food restaurant where the food is always made fresh to order. In fact, that's part of Ernesto's motto: "always open, always fresh." Yes, you heard right. Ernesto's is open 24 hours a day, six days a week. They close at 9 p.m. on Sunday and open at 9 a.m. on Monday.

So, how does the food measure up? Honestly, at three in the morning after a long night of partying, anything tastes good. However, the cooks at Ernesto's never fail to deliver great tasting well-executed food, even at more conventional times during the day. Their carne asada nachos ($4.95) come with shredded cheese, guacamole and sour cream, and can feed a large group. The quesadillas ($3.25 - $4.95) come in a large variety with everything from just cheese to carnitas (seasoned grilled pork). The chicken quesadilla ($3.95), which comes bland in most places, is well seasoned. Ernesto's also offers taquitos ($2.75 - $3.25), burritos ($4.55), crispy and soft tacos ($1.85 - $2.20), and Mexican sandwiches called tortas ($3.75 - 4.35).

Ernesto's also has combination plates ($5.45 - $6.50) with items like burritos, enchiladas and tacos. All are served with Mexican rice and refried beans. In keeping with the authenticity of the taqueria, there is a salsa bar that has green tomatillo sauce (a fiery red sauce), and spicy pickled vegetables. You don't have to steer away from a completely Mexican meal when it comes to drinks, either. Ernesto's offers typical Mexican drinks like horchata (sweetened, cinnamon flavored rice milk), passion fruit and tamarind juices, and Mexican soft drinks ($1.35). There are times, however, when it's too early, or too late for that matter, to have a typical lunch or dinner-time dish. Fortunately, Ernesto's Taco Shop serves breakfast specials that include familiar and exotic breakfast burritos and more traditional Mexican breakfast dishes like huevos rancheros (eggs with a tomato sauce).  

Overall, Ernesto's Taco Shop is quite a lifesaver when you're confronted with a late night hunger dilemma. It's relaxed environment also makes a great place to socialize with friends over a plate of nachos or flautas.
