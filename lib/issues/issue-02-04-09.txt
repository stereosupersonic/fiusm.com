Headline: Ashley Judd welcomes success
Author: Barry Koltnow / Knight-Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Although she is a huge movie star married to a famous race-car driver, Ashley Judd is not too big to greet an interviewer outside her hotel bungalow wearing a floppy orange hat, baggy sweat pants and a T-shirt with the message: "This is what a feminist looks like."

Judd, who stars with Morgan Freeman and Jim Caviezel in the military courtroom drama "High Crimes," seems unaffected by who she is, where she is and what her status in the industry really means.

But don't confuse unaffected with unaware. The bright, well-spoken Judd was Phi Beta Kappa at the University of Kentucky, reads French novels in French and throws big words around like other actresses throw around personal assistants.

"This lady is really smart," offered Carl Franklin, who directed her in "High Crimes." "And she needs to be smart to play this character (an attorney defending her husband against murder charges).  She's comfortable speaking the words. That's an unbeatable package in this business - smart, down-to-earth and gorgeous. It's the kind of combination you saw in Audrey Hepburn."

Judd, two weeks shy of her 34th birthday, would never compare herself to Hepburn, but she makes no secret of her intention to have that type of quality career. She is careful in her selection of roles. 

When she was in the third grade, Judd was given a vocational aptitude test. The conclusion was that she should join the circus. No joke.
"I never considered running off to join the circus after that test, but I now realize that the results made sense," she explained. "My interests seemed chaotic because they were so diverse. I suppose the circus life seemed a logical choice." Judd always wanted to be an actress, but never knew how to go about accomplishing it.

"I had this internal compass that told me that I wanted to act, but there were no external street signs for me to follow. I don't want to indict the educational system in America but I just didn't know anything that would help me to follow my interests."

She grew up poor, rural and nomadic. The family moved from state to state and she was 15 when her mother, Naomi, and sister, Wynonna, recorded their first album. Ashley cleaned their tour bus for $10 a day. 
Judd said she never wanted to join the family business and, instead, enrolled at the University of Kentucky, where she majored in French but also studied acting. Upon graduation, she moved to Los Angeles, got her first acting job on an episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," and then made the easy transition to the big screen in "Ruby in Paradise."
Her box-office successes have made her a bankable star in a town that worships bankable stars, but Judd says she stays clear of the business side of the business. 

"I prefer to inoculate myself from that disease," she said with a hint of disdain. That can turn into a whole life for some people, but it is of no interest to me. I have a real life to lead."

That life stars Judd as the loving wife and CART driver Dario Franchitti as the devoted husband in a marriage that opened Dec. 12 to rave reviews. She gives the pairing a thumbs-up. "Marriage is cool," she said. "Marriage is right on."

"I didn't know enough about racing to know who he was, and I think he appreciated that," she said. "As for him, he still hasn't seen most of my movies."

Headline: "Big Trouble" provokes big laughs
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
The best kinds of comedies are the ones you laugh at.

This obvious concept is something that has been overlooked by Hollywood many times. Just look at any Farrelly brothers' comedy after "There's Something About Mary," or "Scary Movie 2." They're all comedies, but I don't remember laughing a single time throughout those movies. This clearly means that the comedy has failed. Yet drivel continues to be released. Just sit around for some of the trailers for upcoming movies.

"Big Trouble" is the first time in a while that I've laughed along with an audience to a new release. It was kind of jarring, the sudden hysterics I was caught in the middle of. I literally looked around, one eyebrow cocked, laughing along with the crowd. And all it took was a goat.

Barry Sonnenfeld has finally redeemed himself after making a comedy no one laughed at ("Wild Wild West") and two shows no one saw ("Maximum Bob" and the ill-fated it-could've-been-good-but-it-wasn't "The Tick") with "Big Trouble," a ridiculously plotted comedy that effortlessly saves itself by taking place in Miami. You'd expect no less when the film is based on a novel by Dave Barry, desperately trying to homage his two friends and Florida-fictionalists, Carl Hiassen and Elmore Leonard.

The story is about a lot of things, a cornucopia of characters running together to string along one situation. Matt Arnold (Ben Foster) is playing a game called Killer, where he must squirt Jenny Herk (Zooey Deschanel) with a water gun. This happens at the same time a hitman (Dennis Farina) is shooting at Jenny's stepfather, Arthur (Stanley Tucci). The shooting scares the Herk's maid (Sofia Vergara), who is frightened into the arms of a bum named Puggy (Jason Lee) who happens to be living in a tree house in the Herk backyard. While Jenny's mother, Anna (Rene Russo… Christ, what isn't she in?), falls for Matt's father, Eliot (Tim Allen), Arthur decides to purchase some illegal weapons for protection at a bar owned by two Russian immigrants. What he gets is a metal suitcase, which is in turn, kidnapped, along with Jenny and Puggy, by two idiot street thugs named Eddie and Snake (Johnny Knoxville and Tom Sizemore).

In the long run, the entire movie is just one long set-up for a chase through Miami, culminating at Miami International Airport, with Sonnenfeld using a ticking time bomb to amp up the intensity. But "Big Trouble" isn't in it for the story, so much as it is for the quirky characters. The hitmen are repeatedly harassed by Gators fans ("morons," he calls them – send your letters to Disney). Puggy has a strange fixation with Fritos, Arthur a strange fixation with feet and Martha Stewart and even the family dog has a strange fixation with a giant toad that eats his food.

One of the things I've always enjoyed about Barry's columns is his whimsical exaggeration of human conversation. The patter almost has its own rhythms and styles, where you make a crack, make people realize the stupidity of their conversations and still relish it, sometimes much like real people I know. Screenwriters Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone were smart enough to keep that wonderful dialogue mostly intact (like the randomly silly tossed-out conversation on mosquito sexuality).
In fact, much of the story remains intact. There are deviations, but only upon deeper inspection. Some of the changes work better too. Like Martha Stewart's cameo, for example (I had to pick up the book again to remember Barry had used Elizabeth Dole for the gag instead). Even typical Barry gags such as ridiculous names for fictional bands that actually sound perfectly legit. The only thing missing was for a character to say "and I am NOT making this up."

Also much like you'd expect from something written by Barry, jokes are made at the expense of Miami, but never to the point where it's offensive to us city dwellers. 

Unfortunately, some of the Miami gags that work excellently in the novel get muffled in the film without Barry's wry commentary. Sure, goats running around the streets and causing traffic delays is funny, but it's a much bigger laugh when you know that the goats "had been destined for sale in Hialeah, for use in ritual sacrifices by practitioners of the Santeria religion," as the book emphasizes.

Not that the goats aren't funny as hell in the movie anyway.

Headline: New comic line piles on hype
Author: Alex Segura, Jr. / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
If you have any sense of comic book history, the first thing you pick up on is that it's a very cyclical industry. Characters come and go. Some lay dormant for decades before being revamped and souped-up for a new generation. Some are constant. Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Wonder Woman.
 
But just because they've got 60 odd years under their belts doesn't mean they don't change. Batman started his career as a gun-toting murderer. Clark Kent at one point worked as a TV anchorman. Wonder Woman became a kimono-wearing feminist crusader. Spider-Man met his clone and realized he wasn't who he thought he was for the last 20 years. You get the picture. Comic books thrive on constant change and renewal. 
Case in point: Marvel Comic's not-so-new Ultimate line of books. Taking a cue from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, comic's hottest creators have revamped the origins of Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Avengers for a new generation of bagged, metal-foiled geeks. 

The stories place our beloved characters into the next century. Instead of being a photographer for The Daily Bugle, young Peter Parker works on the Bugle's web site. Instead of being a grandfatherly old codger, Peter's Uncle Ben is a groovin' former hippie. Ant-Man is now a wife-beating egomaniac and Iron Man takes a few martinis in the morning before putting on his metal swimsuit. Get the idea?

While the revamps seem trendy, cutting edge and at times entertaining, you still find yourself with one lingering thought after reading any given issue of Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate X-Men or the Ultimates: What's the point?

If there's been one thing preventing American comics from reaching the mainstream, it's the lack of accessibility and the general public's perception that comics are read by geeks and social rethreads. The idea of restarting a character to appeal to new readers seems novel and makes a lot of sense, but it fails if you don't do it in earnest.
 
Marvel has tried to appease both new and longtime readers by having the revamped characters exist in their own "Ultimate universe" while keeping the Spider-Man, X-Men and Avengers we all know and love alive and well in the Marvel universe. Confused yet?
 
Imagine being a 12 year old fresh from seeing the Spider-Man or X-Men movie, looking to catch the latest adventures of his or her newly favorite character. Where do you start? New X-Men? Uncanny X-Men? X-Treme X-Men? Ultimate X-Men? X-Men Unlimited? X-Force? X-Factor? X-Statics? The list goes on. It's complicated enough for longtime comic book readers to keep up. 

The only way to get more people reading comics is to make them more available, not by revamping the characters. Instead of worrying about how relevant Wolverine's origin is to readers, companies like Marvel and DC should be finding ways to get comic books into news stands and grocery store lines, where kids can find them.

Headline: "Jessica Stein" charms crowds
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Call me crazy, but for a while I was actually beginning to think that the "being gay is not a choice" argument had finally taken off, and then along comes a movie that seems dedicated to turning this idea on its head. "Kissing Jessica Stein" starts off like your typical comedy about the trials and tribulations of dating, with the added bonus of homosexuality thrown in to complicate matters. 

The title character, played by Jennifer Westfeldt, is an endearing nut, a typical Sandra Bullock character, wrought with the kind of quirky flaws everybody loves her for. She's desperate for love and desperately unhappy, stagnated by her station in love and life. And yet, she's so incredibly anal-retentive and nit-picking in terms of what to her constitutes "the one," that you get the impression few will ever measure up.  At one point, she goes through a slew of dates, braving dinner with so many losers you begin to wonder if she wandered into a colony where the black-sheep products of incestuous couples are herded.

Enter Josh, the man of her dreams who is also, of course, the man she hates. Josh and Jessica have the kind of interplay that always makes you want to scream: "Oh God, just sleep together and get it over with!"
Of course, it can never be that simple.  Although Josh and Jessica are clearly destined for each other, they are pulled apart by their own arrogance and reluctance to see what is right in front of them.  Jessica, feeling that love will never come, begins to wonder whether she's just been looking in the wrong place, or gender for that matter. 
 
Conveniently enough, Helen (Heather Juergensen) places a singles ad read by Jessica, who decides that maybe it's time for her to venture into the final frontier of sex: women.  

It's easy enough for us to accept Helen's little homosexual adventure. She's simply one of these individuals who seem more interested in sex than anything else. For Jessica, however, it's a little more difficult. Rather than depicting Jessica as a straight girl taking a risk for once and then leading her back to Josh and good, old-fashioned heterosexuality, the film takes an interesting turn: Jessica takes a risk for once, dates a woman – and actually seems to like it. 

The interplay between Jessica and Helen works flawlessly. If the filmmakers hadn't originally intended them to be together, something beyond them must have decided for them. The chemistry between the actresses was simply so right you actually start to forget that the governing quasi-romance between Jessica and Josh was seemingly intended to be the heart of the film.
 
The growth of Helen and Jessica's relationship takes up the majority of the film, and thankfully so, as it is the most endearing and funny aspect of the film. Jessica's attempts at sex with Helen, for example, are hilarious. Jessica, being the lovable control freak that she is, tries to build herself up to lesbian sex, going a little further with Helen each time, but always stopping short, leaving a very frustrated Helen behind (who is probably at this point thinking farm animals probably wouldn't be such a hard lay).  

When Jessica, the ultimate perfectionist, finally lets go and allows herself to be with Helen it is a pivotal moment for her character. And it would have been a great movie – had it ended there. Unfortunately, it didn't.
Sadly, a great, light-hearted, albeit forgettable, little comedy is ruined by filmmakers who refused to let the chemistry of the characters take them where it begged to go. The film is ruined in the last 20 minutes by a contrived montage that runs us through every lesbian cliché in 10 minutes or less. 

Of course, I don't want to ruin the ending (if it's possible to do any more of that), but my advice would be to watch the film and leave about before the end. 

Trust me, you'll know exactly when to leave, because a little voice in your head will begin to scream: "No! Don't go there. For the love of God, don't go there!"  Spare yourself the heartache and leave early.  
The film makes her out to be just a straight girl looking for a thrill, and I don't know about anybody else, but I generally don't go around screwing my friends. Suggesting that Helen and Jessica are merely friends is ridiculous, because frankly, oral sex is not the kind of "girl talk" truly straight women engage in. 

Sadly, "Kissing Jessica Stein" goes from being a funny film about finding love in unexpected ways, to a mediocre film about a girl who comes out of a closet she was never in to begin with.

Author: Hans and Jackie / Staff Columnists
&nbsp;
This week, it's Jackie's turn to ask her regulars some questions about their lives, while Hans sits back and enjoys a bowl...of Lucky Charms. Hey, who are we to judge? To each his own.

J: Guru, can sex be unhealthy in large amounts? 
[b]A: How dare you even ask this?  The mere suggestion is blasphemous.  Go have seven orgies to atone for your sin.
The Guru[/b]

J: Candle, isn't it true that if you play with fire you're eventually going to get burned? So why is it so much fun to play with it?
[b]A: Just having control over the possibility of being burned is the fun part about playing with fire. Unless you lose control and you accidently set your house on fire, at which time you need get the hell out. And come on, don't you want to play with a little Candle "wax?"
Candle[/b]

J: Curious Moron, are you curious enough to create life through cloning? And if so, who would you clone?
[b]A: Genetics have already reached the point where we have cracked the entire genetic code of rice. RICE! And a week later, we get news of a woman pregnant with a clone. I think it's clear that we must have ethics committees ban cloning, because otherwise, Rice people, much like Pod people, will begin harvesting humans, eating us with curry mustard at Chicken Kitchen! To quote Dr. Ian Malcolm, famed Chaotician, these "scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should." Oh the humanity! Rice people and T-Rexes! In other words, I'd clone Mike the headless chicken of 1945. Or Audrey Hepburn. Which ever tastes better with my Chop-Chop.
Curious Moron[/b]

J: Handy Man, if you could be a tool, which would you be and why?
[b]A: A Gynecologist's vaginal speculum. Need I explain why?
Handy Man[/b]

J: Hey Xander, when practicing bondage while watching an episode of Buffy, how much spanking is too much? 
[b]A: There's never too much spanking while watching Buffy, but it has to come in concentrated waves that vary depending on what's going on in the episode. For example, whenever Buffy and Spike go at it, spanking should all but cease. When Tara and Willow get jiggy, it reaches a moderate level. And if Xander and Buffy have even rudimentary contact, it should go into a fever pitch. 
Xander Von Rook[/b]

J: CT, you seem to be wild stud type. So spill: what's your favorite song to play to put your date in the mood for love?
[b]A: If I ever desire to get my intentions across to my significant other, I must confess that no song gets them in the mood for some good ol' fashioned lovin' like Nine Inch Nails' "Closer". It's hard to beat around the bush with lyrics like "I want to feel you from the inside."

Headline: In Our View: BBC turnout, number of candidates embarrassing
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Biscayne Bay Student Government will be holding a runoff election between two lower division representative candidates. Both candidates accumulated a grand total of six votes each, requiring a new election.

We kid you not. In something that seems ripped from the pages of The Onion, BBC Student Government elections featured not only the laughable tie but only two contested elections. Yes, two. What happened to the other positions? Were they eliminated? 

Maybe that would be a more feasible solution. It would have saved on a few boxes of pizza. 

Instead, BBC students were treated to a Student Government coronation. Adrian Carter, along with almost every other candidate, ran unopposed. 

It wasn't because of a great mandate from the voters that these candidates were swept back into office. It's because there was no one running against them. 

The fault lies both with the passive students who failed to involve themselves in their own student government and with the student government itself for failing to properly publicize not only the voting days, but the actual process.

Getting students to vote is fine and dandy, but the first step is to get candidates. By letting people know with ample time when the application deadlines are, you could easily increase the candidate pool. 

It is not because there is a dearth of leaders at BBC that students are left with no choice. Other clubs and organizations that are in the know when it comes to SGA need to take a more active role. 

If you see your thoughts are not being represented, pick up an application and run. Surely you can muster more than 10 votes, which seems to guarantee election. 

The key, especially with something as important as student government, is information. The students need to know the basics of the election in order to make an informed choice. Even before that, they have to at least get the chance to make a choice, period. What we're left with is a group of dedicated student leaders who have been elected by default. 

It's up to them to correct the pathetic voter turnout and increase the number of qualified candidates. Otherwise, student government will be looked upon as a clique even more so than it already is. 

It may not be solely their fault, but it is their responsibility to rectify what will hopefully become a humorous footnote in the BBC records.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Miami minority influence should pave way for gay adoption issue
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

Bravo, Helena Poleo. I agree with her column on gay adoption in the March 26, 2002 issue of The Beacon wholeheartedly. I am not a homosexual myself, but I am deeply saddened by the way homosexuals are viewed by people, particularly on this campus. (This is based on certain "Campus Query" answers in the same issue.) How can it be that we can live in South Florida, the land of minorities, and still be so prejudiced? 

Many of our parents and grandparents came from other countries and have paid heavy costs for their freedom. Some of them have had to put up with the evils of segregation, or being beaten up for speaking Spanish in school. 

It disgusts and sickens me to hear the children and grandchildren of these people saying such horrible things about homosexuality, especially homosexuals who wish to adopt. This angers and saddens me to a degree for which there are no words.

In this country, there are a great many unwanted children who need families. By "unwanted" I mean those consideredtoo old or suffer from an illness tooexpensive to treat. 

Being bounced from home to home is horrible; it means having to get adjusted to a completely different family every single time. Every time you make new friends and bond with your new family, you have to be sent away to a new place somewhere else. 

Most of us were lucky enough to have been born or adopted into great homes. We were fed, clothed and sent to school. We were forced to eat our vegetables, sleep at a certain time, do our homework and take baths. Our families were always there for us. Can you believe that some people would want to deny this type of love from children, just because their prospective parents are gay? 

Or what about the little boy raised by a gay couple for 10 years? He has four brothers and sisters (all adopted from different homes, except two) whom he loves deeply. He doesn't want to leave his home. He loves his parents very much. 

Yet our laws are trying to save him from the "trauma" of being raised by gay parents by ripping him out of his home and placing him in the foster care system all over again, until a straight couple hopefully adopts him. How is this possible? 

When I was 10, I certainly wouldn't have liked it if social workers came to my home, said that my parents were unfit because they are of a different ethnicity than the norm, and put me with a different family. 

But society wants it to be that way. Normal little girls and boys belong in "traditional" homes, with two parents (a man and a woman) of the same color, a quaint little house with a white picket fence, and a dog named Fido. I can't believe that this little boy may have to leave the only family he has ever known, just because our messed-up society thinks that the home he lives in now is wrong. 

That little boy's fathers took him in at seven weeks of age because he was supposed to have died of complications from HIV. Nobody else would have wanted him. How many people would have done such a thing? How many of us would have put our hearts on the line for a child whom everyone expected to die at any moment? 

I admit that even I couldn't do it. But these wonderful people &#8211; these wonderful gay people &#8211; have done it. And what's wrong with that? What's the difference between a gay parent and a straight parent, really? 

Oh, wait, I know. Gay parents are automaticalled "unfit" because they happen to form romantic relationships with people of the same sex, even though they are willing to open their doors and hearts to the "unwanted" children (while most college students don't have the time to drop old toys or clothes into boxes during donation drives to help the "unwanted" homeless people of South Florida.) 

If any of you out there can tell me that that statement makes any sort of sense, then I feel very sorry for you. I feel sorry for anyone who lives in this society today who still has to look down upon other people based on gender, ethnic background, age, or sexual preference. 

Homosexuals do not rape little boys and girls, or try to have sex with everyone they see, or do lots of drugs, as many people think. They do not mess up children's minds, or make children gay, or ruin people's lives simply by existing. Whether it's a little or a lot, hate is still hate, and I don't think that, as young people (mostly minorities) in this society, in 2002, we should hate anybody. 

We are all human beings before we are anything else. And I think that homosexuals should have the right to adopt, care for, and love a child just as much as heterosexuals do. The way the laws are today, it is not [a fair system] for homosexuals who want children or the children who just want to be loved by someone, anyone.

Headline: American consumerism knows no bounds
Author: Virginia C. Cornett
&nbsp;
You know those goofy perfume ads on television that have frighteningly skinny models saying strange things while sitting at the beach wearing an evening gown?  The only clue about what the ad is actually trying to sell comes at the end when the perfume name and designer logo splashes across the screen.  

Nowadays, there seem to be many ads like these; ads which don't appear to advertise anything.  Maybe that's part of the strategy of the commercial: make absolutely no mention of the product so the viewer has to pay rapt attention to the screen, then spend hours mulling over the existential meaning over lattes at Starbuck's with friends, further drilling the vision of the product into your brain.  Before you know it you are driving to the mall in a stupefied daze to buy whatever it is they're peddling. 

Recently, I saw an ad with the complete opposite marketing philosophy.  This visa ad, which I saw at a Target, was on a huge poster with giant red letters that read "THE POWER TO GET."  Wow.  Can you get any more direct and to the point?  I cringed, but I'm sure that makes me a part of the consumer minority, and that a good number of others who saw the ad marched zombie-like to the counter for an application. 

Okay, maybe not, but only because most people already carry a stack of credit cards in their wallets.  Still, I bet they didn't find the slogan as repulsive as I did. 

Have we become so shallow a society that we can be lured into living above our means by so overt an announcement?  It's bad enough that it is so engrained in our lives that our worth as humans is not defined by what's in our hearts and our brains and our deeds but by what's in our bank accounts.  

We live in a world where money is considered the highest of all values and our lives from sun-up to sun-down revolve around the acquisition of material things.  And now we are so greedy to "get" that all someone has to do is remind us that we want to get and we switch into autopilot and fall for it again and again.   

The ad didn't show a picture of a great looking sports car or a hand-made leather sofa or a beautiful bedspread. It showed nothing tangible, but you could almost imagine that car or the sofa or the bedspread–or all three and more–being yours.  Anything you want could be within your grasp with the swipe of a card and the signing of your name.  

There's never enough, is there?  We're going along fine, content with where we are until we get a raise. Suddenly, what we had wasn't good enough. Now, we have to get a better car or a bigger house or the most fashionable shoes.  

We get those things and are relatively happy with them until we happen to get another raise. Once again, they're not good enough; now we need an even better car or even bigger house.  And no matter how much money we make, we keep racking up debt in pursuit of the biggest and the best.  

Our parents and certainly our grandparents might be perplexed at this propensity we have to live on credit spending money we don't have.  They remember having to, God forbid, save money to buy that couch then go to the store and, God forbid, pay cash for it.  That idea is foreign to many of us.  In fact, it's actually a status symbol to have the fanciest-looking, hologram picture, platinum, zillion-dollar limit credit card.  

And now at the beginning of the 21st Century, Gandhi's observation in the last century is as poignant now as ever: "the luxuries for our fathers have become necessities for us".  

We simply can't live without adding to our material excess in some way–some way to puff out our chests and say: "Yes, I am a better, fuller person because I now have 'insert useless item here.' Now I have "THE POWER TO GET."  

I think if you read the fine print you'll see that the slogan really reads "THE POWER TO GET...in debt."

Headline: College sports need more women coaches
Author: Sanhita SinhaRoy
&nbsp;
A record 30,000 people attended this year's championship game in San Antonio to watch the University of Connecticut win its third NCAA title. The game came 20 years after the NCAA held its first basketball championship for women and 30 years after Title IX was passed into law, mandating equal treatment for women athletes at educational institutions receiving federal money. 

Since then, the number of women's teams has grown to a record high, allowing more female athletes the opportunity to play collegiate sports. But while the participation and popularity of women's sports continues to grow–particularly in basketball, softball and soccer–female coaches are being benched.

Of the 8,132 women's collegiate teams in all sports, men now hold a majority of those head-coaching positions. The percentage of females who coach women's teams declined to 44 percent in 2002, down from 45.6 percent in 2000, according to a recently released biannual study by the Project on Women and Social Change at Smith College and Brooklyn College.

In all three divisions of NCAA women's basketball, the percentage of female coaches is now 62 percent, compared to 79 percent in 1977. Athletic departments around the country need to make a more concerted effort to hire women in head-coaching positions. Athletes, both male and female, need women role models, and they need to see women in leadership positions.

UConn head coach Geno Auriemma is to be applauded not only as a great coach but also as someone who recognizes the need for female coaches. He has said that if qualifications are equal between male and female applicants for a head-coaching job, "You should hire the woman." He also was instrumental in getting Sherri Coale hired to coach Oklahoma, his opponent in the finals.

Equality will have arrived when female coaches break the barrier into men's collegiate sports. Women hold no head-coaching positions in Division I men's basketball, and only two have ever been assistant coaches. In all male collegiate sports, women make up only 2 percent of head-coaching jobs, according to the study.

What's needed are athletic directors willing to recruit female coaches. Currently, 82 percent of athletic directors are men, and about 19 percent of women's athletic programs have no women in any administrative positions, the report says.

Athletic departments would be more successful in recruiting and retaining female coaches if they offered what many of them offer male coaches: competitive salaries and sufficient facilities and equipment. 

Since its inception, Title IX has helped pave the way for women athletes. Athletic departments should now let more female coaches into the game.

Headline: Satan has rights too
Author: Jason Andreasen
&nbsp;
About a month ago, a small Florida fishing town miraculously found the cure to all our country's ills. On the official letterhead of the town of Inglis, the mayor, Carolyn Risher, penned a proclamation banning the "Prince of Darkness." 

She claimed that the events of Sept. 11gave her the inspiration to make the proclamation. The majority of the townspeople reportedly agree with the mayor's decision, though there are a few dissenting opinions. 

"Satan, ruler of darkness, giver of evil, destroyer of what is good and just, is not now, nor ever again will be, a part of this town of Inglis," reads the proclamation. The fact that she would do such a thing is as silly as it is wrong. Risher had absolutely no right to "outlaw" Satan. 

So what if there are Satanists in her town? Is it not their constitutional right to practice their religion as they see fit? Does that mean the mayor should drive these folks out of town with pitchforks and lit torches? 

In the First Amendment, there is a provision for the separation of church and state. It is the job of the government, state and federal government to not only disallow any infringements upon this rule, but also to not make any infringements themselves. This instance is a blatant encroachment upon this rule. 

In fact, the Florida ACLU Director, Howard Simon, said, "This is the most extreme intrusion into religion by a public official that I have ever seen in my 27 years as a director of the ACLU." 

Now, I think it is safe to say that most people do not like Lucifer. And don't get me wrong, I'm no Satanist. However, the fact of the matter is simple: there exists a separation of church and state. We cannot simply ignore such rules whenever we want to. 
This nation was built on these guidelines – guidelinesfollowed even at times when they were not agreed with. That is the mark of a true belief, when it is adhered to, even when it might not be the most favorable option. 

Like many other government officials have done recently, Risher is pushing her own agenda and views while shamelessly relating them to Sept. 11. Those Inglis residents who do agree with the proclamation all seem to have this air of, "Had you stupid people only listened to me before, Sept. 11 would have never happened." 

Risher even came out and said in an interview that the proclamation's purpose was to inspire her townspeople in the event of another Sept. 11. In a time when there is so much confusion, it is irresponsible for government officials like Risher to hide such blatant religious propaganda under the veil of Sept. 11. 

There was so much fuss about the fact that if we let our lives be changed by the events of Sept. 11, "the terrorists would have won." And yet, as a result of Sept. 11, we are now seeing some government officials completely disregarding the Constitution. 

If this is what we have come to, then chalk one up for the bad guys.

Headline: Eldred becomes FIU homerun king
Subheadline: First baseman hits 33rd in series loss at Western Kentucky
Author: Alex Braswell / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU (26-10, 3-6) lost 8-6 to Western Kentucky (22-8, 6-2) and was swept for the first time in three years.

Early, Brad Eldred hit a towering two-run homerun that landed somewhere in the parking lot behind the 330 foot left field wall to extend FIU's lead 3-0. Eldred now is FIU's career homerun record at 33.

The Hilltoppers came back in the bottom half of the inning scoring two runs on a bases loaded situation as Nick Turner hit a two RBI single to left field to bring in Rafael Vallejo and Tanner Townsend to cut FIU's lead to 3-2.

The Hilltoppers broke the tie in the bottom of the fifth on a two RBI double to right field by Jeff Pacholke, which bought in both Townsend and Cattell for the 5-3 lead.

With the bases loaded and two outs in the top of the sixth, Hector Nuñez was walked on a full count to bring in Daniel Bustamante to cut the lead 5-4. 

Adam Summerell followed with a two RBI single up the middle to bring in Eldred and Bernie Gonzalez to retake the lead 6-5.

Michael Mendez relieved FIU starter Carlos Sanchez who went  five innings and allowed three hits and four earned runs while striking out four. 

WKU took back the lead in the sixth as Ryan Arnett scored on left field single by Townsend and Travis Brown who scored from third on a sacrifice fly by Cattell.

WKU added a run to their lead in the seventh as pinch hitter Antone Towns hit a sacrifice fly to center field to score in Patrick Ransdell for the 8-6 lead.

With Tommy Dueñas on first with two outs, pinch hitter Alex Suarez struck out looking.

WKU 14, FIU 5

FIU lost its second game of the series to Western Kentucky 14-5.

The Hilltoppers had no problems with the FIU pitchers, getting 17 hits off the unit. FIU left 12 runners on base, a recurring theme in this series as nine wereleft on Friday night's game. 

The lone bright spot for the Golden Panthers was Eldred who broke the school career record of 31 homeruns on a 370 foot homerun in the third inning.                        

Western Kentucky came back with a run in the bottom half of that inning as Tanner Townsend reached base on a fielder's choice and scored on a double to right field by Ryan Cattell to tie the game 1-1.

Tied one apiece in the third, Eldred blasted a 2-2 changeup pitch, a 370 foot plus  solo homerun over left field to break the school record of 31 homeruns in a career set by Sean Mahoney and Luis Fernandez. 

"I knew I had a shot at it," Eldred said. "I thought about it this coming season. I was glad I hit it in front of my grandmother [who] came all the way from Tennessee."

Eldred is just four away from tying Fernandez's mark of most homeruns in a season with 21.

The lead didn't last long as the Hilltoppers' Antone Towns tied the game 2-2 with a solo homerun of his own over the right field wall in the top of the fourth. 

WKU put up two more runs in the same inning as Trevor Keesling doubled to left field and was brought home by Patrick Ransdell. Ransdell scored from third on a up-the-middle-single by Townsend.

Keesling scored on a wild pitch and Towns scored on a double play hit by Travis Brown.

The Golden Panthers got back a run in the bottom of the seventh when pinch hitter Daniel Bustamante scored from third on an RBI single by Skip Adams. WKU's lead grew as Townsend hit a three run homerun to right field in the seventh inning to take a 11-3 lead.

WKU was not done yet though, scoring three more runs in the eighth to stretch their lead 14-3.

In a last effort, FIU scored two runs in the ninth as Solomon Freider hit a two RBI single to left field to bring in Hector Nunez and Skip Adams to close out the score 14-5.

Western Kentucky 8, FIU 2

On a cold night with temperatures in the 30's, the FIU bats went cold as the Golden Panthers lost 8-2 to Western Kentucky in the first game of the three game series. FIU has lost all three conference series openers this season.

Taner Townsend put the Hilltoppers up first, 1-0, in the bottom of the first with a solo homerun to left field.

Headline: Offense dominates scrimmage with 5 TD
Author: Pete Pelegrin / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Displaying an offensive prowess that would make Dan Marino, who was in attendance, proud, the FIU offense had its way with the defense in the second spring scrimmage.

The Golden Panther offense scored five touchdowns in eight possessions during the 61-play scrimmage, despite missing running back Tori Robinson due to an irregular heartbeat.

After making some changes during the week, head coach Don Strock's offense had the defense playing on its heels.

"We changed up a bit today on offense," Strock said.  "We took out some counters, spread the field more and basically threw the ball real well."  

"Both Tabor and Fleming threw it around real well today."

Quarterbacks David Tabor and Joe Fleming marched the offense up and down the field with precision passes, a bullying offensive line and a running game that shot through the holes for some big gains.

Tabor was 13 of 18 for 144 yards and a touchdown.  Fleming, coming off a thigh injury, was almost perfect going 8 of 9 for 85 yards and two touchdowns.

Wide receiver Everett Mitchell caught two passes for 41 yards and two touchdowns.  He caught a 31-yard strike from Fleming to end the first half of the scrimmage.

Receivers Michael Edge (two catches, 39 yards) and Julius Eppinger (three catches, 38 yards) also contributed to the receiving corps.  

Tight end Joseph Struyf caught the third FIU touchdown on a 15-yard hookup with Fleming.

"The receivers ran much better routes and caught the ball much better today," Strock said.

The driving force of the offense's success in the scrimmage was the offensive line, which opened up holes throughout the day.

The Golden Panther running game didn't miss a beat with Rashod Smith filling in for the spring's leading rusher, Robinson.   

The team doesn't believe it's serious, but held him out of the scrimmage as a precautionary measure. 

Smith carried 14 times for 67 yards and a touchdown.  

Jerrid Lundstedt and O.J. Price were also solid.  Lundstedt had 10 carries for 34 yards and a scores.Price ran four times for 33 yards for 8.3 yards per carry.

"We're going to be a passing team, but I was very pleased with the way we ran the ball today," Strock said.  "The offensive line really stepped it up today."  

"When you get the running game going, the passing game works and obviously that's what happened today," Strock said.

The offense rang up 353 total yards (5.8 yards per play), 124 rushing yards and 229 through the air.

Defensive lineman Christopher Horne and linebacker Shaun Dudney led the defense with six tackles each and Horne had a sack.

"We're really pleased with the effort and work ethic out here today," Strock said.

"There was a lot of hustle out there and everybody got in and contributed."

Spring practice concludes with the inaugural Blue & Gold Scrimmage next Saturday, April 13 at 1 pm.

Headline: Pitching, defense leads softball
Author: Pete Pelegrin / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If the old baseball adage, pitching and defense wins championships is true, then FIU made a statement to start Sun Belt Conference play.  The Golden Panthers took 3 of 4 in their opening Sun Belt Conference series against rival Middle Tennessee State in what is turning into a heated rivalry.  FIU opened the week with a 4-1 loss to No. 11 Florida Atlantic.

FIU 1, MTS 0 (10 innings)

It took ten intense innings, but after Kristen Perry laid down a suicide squeeze to score Lesley Gillen, the Golden Panthers (31-24, 3-1 SBC) emerged with a 1-0 victory to take 3 out of 4 games against Middle Tennessee State (18-19, 1-3).

Pitching on both sides dominated the game.  FIU threw goose eggs on the Blue Raiders scoreboard led by Kendra Laminack and Amanda Nealer who each threw five shutout innings.  Nealer (10-4) recorded the win.

"I have to give a lot of the credit to (catcher) Kristen Perry," Nealer said.  "She gives me a lot of confidence when she talks to me on the mound."

"Amanda Nealer is one of the top pitchers in the conference," coach Kim Gywdir said.  "She's been in those situations [top of the 10th] a lot this year and she's come through.  She's very calm and mature."  

Middle Tennessee State's hard-throwing lefty Jennifer Martinez, 1st team All-Conference last year, shutout the Golden Panthers for 9 and 1/3 innings before Perry's bunt.

With the sun beaming at full blast and temperatures in the high 80's, the game got hotter when MTSU base runner Lindsay Azevedo shoved FIU third baseman Crystal Boyer on a play at third base.  The two had to be separated. 

In the sixth inning, Boyer was plunked in her second at-bat of the game and the umpire issued a warning to both coaches on hit batters.

"This rivalry started last year.  It's a heated rivalry," Gywdir said.  "It's a nice one to have, because we don't have too many rivalries in softball.  It's something to look forward to."

In a game last year with the Blue Raiders, FIU shortstop Stephanie Wolter was taken out hard on a double play attempt at 2nd base.

Nealer, who's nursing a collarbone and right wrist injury, pitched her way out of a testy situation in the top of the 10th.

With a runner on 3rd base and only 1 out, the FIU lefty struck out consecutive batters to escape the jam.

In the bottom of the 10th, Gillen was placed on 2nd base, due to International Tie Rule, and was sacrificed to 3rd with a nifty bunt by cleanup hitter Jennifer Owens.  

Perry then laid down a bunt that just died between Martinez and 1st baseman Megan Cherinka and Gillen slid into home with the winning run.

"Kristen is one of our best bunters," Gywdir said.  "I have complete faith in her that she'll get it down."

MTS 6, FIU 3

FIU pitching shutout MTSU for 29 of the 30 innings that were played in the 4 game series.  The only inning the Blue Raiders scored in, the top of the 4th in game 3, won them their only game.

Vanessa Preston was rolling right along with a 3-0 lead until the Blue Raider 4th.       

MTSU opened the floodgates with a combined 7 hits and 6 runs off of Preston and Leah Barnes who came in to relieve.

"It's just one of those games where the ball found the holes," Coach Gywdir said.  "There were a lot of seeing-eye hits and bleeders that you just couldn't do anything about." 

FIU 2, MTS 0

Looking like the Blue Raiders of the lost art of hitting,  MTSU could not unearth any offense against the righty-lefty dynamic duo of Kendra Laminack and Amanda Nealer.

Laminack (8-5) threw five shutout innings for the win and Nealer finished it off for her 3rd save of the year.

FIU pitching recorded its 14th shutout of the season.

"The combination of Kendra and Amanda is awesome," Coach Gywdir said.  "Kendra's ball goes one way and Amanda's goes the opposite way"

"I thought I pitched OK.  They're a big hitting team and they swing at everything," Laminack said.  

Centerfielder Lesley Gillen  preserved the shutout when she fired a throw Ashley Way trying to score from 2nd on a single. 

"The defense was there all game," Nealer said.  "If they hit the ball to us, then I have a lot of confidence that we're going to catch it.

Stephanie Wolter, who broke up a no-hit bid by the Blue Raiders Jennifer Martinez in the 4th, led the Golden Panthers with two hits.

 "Stephanie Wolter had some nice hitting and she was unbelievable at short for us," Gywdir said.

Crystal Boyer had a sacrifice fly to score the first FIU run and Kristen Perry capped off the scoring with a RBI single.

FIU 3, MTS 0

In a preview of what was to come for MTSU the rest of the weekend, the Golden Panther pitching and defense carried them to a 3-0 shutout win.

Led by 4 double plays, Vanessa Preston (9-8) won it and Leah Barnes got her 2nd save of the year.

Preston went 4.2 innings before Barnes came in to put out a fire in the top of the 5th.

Barnes, doing her best Mariano Rivera imitation, snuffed out MTSU's only real scoring threat when she got Lisa Sherman looking on a called third strike with runners on 2nd and 3rd to end the potential rally.

"I've been struggling a little this year," Barnes said.  "I've been put in big situations before and haven't always done well, but it was nice to come through."  

"We got great pitching today," Coach Gywdir said.  "We're fortunate in that we're very deep and we have four quality arms."

"There was great D," Barnes said.  "We had a different attitude for our conference schedule.  We came out very enthusiastic."

Boyer and Owens partook in the offensive enthusiasm with 2 hits each and Nicole Dubovik added a run-scoring single as well.

Boyer had a run-scoring double.

"Crystal was huge both with her bat and her glove," Coach Gywdir said.

"I'm seeing the ball better which is building my confidence," Boyer said.  

Florida Atlantic 4, FIU 1

Florida Atlantic pitcher Nicole Myers used both her arm and bat to send the Owls past FIU, 4-1.

Myers pitched a complete game with 6 strikeouts and belted a solo home run.

Laminack took the loss for FIU (28-23) despite striking out 7.

Headline: Journalism school holds 11th Communications Week
Subheadline: Flores receives Dean's Citation
Author: Beatriz Simoes / Biscayne Bay Editor
&nbsp;
The School of Journalism and Mass Communications (SJMC) gave students an opportunity to interact and learn from professionals in their fields during the 11th annual Communication Week held April 1 to April 4. 

A lecture by Kevin Layne of Forty/Layne Entertainment kicked off the events Monday. Later in the day, a student video showcase, organized by television production student Aldo Pincini, featured short films, music videos and other productions by FIU students. 

The showcase was one of the highlights of the week assistant director of SJMC student services Adriana B. Stella-Repaci said. 

"It was a different event," Stella-Repaci said, "It was a great way for everyone to appreciate how hard the students worked all year."

She said she hopes to make the showcase a part of Communication Week every year.

On Tuesday students put on suits and printed resumes to attend the communication networking fair. Employers included NBC 6 and WSVN-TV 7 as well as a large number of Public Relations and Advertising firms. An advertising panel discussion was held, and a group of Pulitzer Prize winners talked to students about "how to win the big prize," on the same day.

Stella-Repaci said the networking fair received a great turnout and was a great chance for students to get personal information from employers. 

Career services took over Wednesday giving workshops on interviewing and resume writing. Professionals were available for mock interviews in specific fields giving students an idea of what it is like in the professional world, and receiving instructions on how to perform in different situations. Students were also taught on the best resume writing techniques and got their own resumes critiqued individually. Students were honored on Thursday at the Student Celebration & Awards Ceremony. Pincell Hair, News Director for KCBS in Los Angeles received the 2002 Outstanding Alumni Award.

SJMC Dean J. Arthur Heise said Hair's presence made this year's Communication Week particularly special. 

"He is a role model," Heise said, "it is incredible to see someone who has gone so far in such a short time."

Hair was a student at FIU in the late 80's who came back and graduated in 2000. In the two years after graduation he has raised to the position of news director in one of the top 3 markets. 

Three students, Connie L. LaFlame, Anthony L. Russell and Christie A. Lowey were given 2002 outstanding students award from the department of advertising & public relations, while Cynthia J. Penny, Eddy Vivas, Erika Maldonado, Michael S. Snelten and Natalia Guerrero were chosen as the outstanding students for journalism & broadcasting.

Students were also awarded with scholarships such as the CBS-4 scholarship given to Jennifer Nieves. 

Natalia Flores received this years Dean's Citation.

Dean Heise said the week was a success, and hopes students were able to realize how successful they can become as well as appreciate where they are by looking at those professionals who were here before them.

Headline: President-elect looks forward to challenges
Subheadline: Morffi involved in Dance Marathon, peer advisors
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
For most, FIU is just a place where you visit for a few hours right after you get out of work. You head to class, sit down for a little over an hour, take notes and discuss some of Shakespeare's works or maybe some mathematical formula. For a few others, the university is an experience of its own where events take place from week to week, helping other students forget about class. For Jessica Morffi, student government's president-elect, FIU is a lot more. It's home.

This was even more evident during the past two weeks while Morffi, a political science major, and her runningmate Omar Castillo were up until the wee hours of the night planning what they were going to do the next day to help them win their joint campaign for president and vice president.

"There were lots of endless nights," a more relaxed Morffi said last Friday. "I was up at 5 a.m. and I usually went to sleep at 3 a.m. Some nights I didn't even get those two hours.

"It was a long two weeks," she said.

But the same students she campaigned hard to represent were the same ones giving her a hand up, pushing her to work harder and accomplish more. It may have been a long two weeks, but with their support, Morffi said, the time seemed to fly.

"It's great to see people respect you," she said. "I could never have [run the campaign] by myself. I can't thank [students] enough for that."

Morffi, now a junior, has always tried to make the univeristy and the time she spent here a bit more meaningful. From the start, she knew she wanted to get involved with campus life.

One of the first things Morffi did was join Dance Marathon, the university's largest student-run philanthropic event. She couldn't get over the fact that although she was just a freshman, she was offered a post within DM &#8211; fund raising chair. Morffi never expected that to happen so soon.

"I was shocked but I took the position," she said. "I was so young but somebody saw it in me."

Having such a high level of involvement at DM, she got to see how everything was run and how things came together and worked out so that in the end, the hospital which gets the funds they raise gets to help children. It motivated her to work harder.

"I admired those that worked hard on it," Morffi said. "They had no reason to do it."

Morffi's experience with DM would not be over after one year. It was something she loved doing and she didn't just want it to be a one-year flirtation &#8211; something to be tossed aside after a little while.

She had been such a success that first year, that as a sophomore she was asked to become DM's overall director. "DM had a great team that year," Morffi said.

This wasn't the easiest thing for Morffi to do.

"My biggest challenge was delegating," she said. "I was always the busy bee."

Although Morffi said seeing the total amount raised for the children was a great sight, there was something much more important behind DM.

"It was a whole year of hard work," she explains. "The total is a great thing but it's about the people who were there, the experience, the kids. It's a great thing."

Morffi plans to continue helping people after graduating from law school.
Dance Marathon wasn't the only organization to impress Morffi. She also fell in love with the idea of becoming a peer advisor.

"You get to learn about FIU, you get a chance to make an impact on students," she said. "You get to make or break their first experience at FIU."

She felt being a peer advisor was a great way of helping to encourage students to become active in other campus organizations.

"If you get a great first experience, you might want to get involved and take pride in your university," Morffi said.

Morffi wanted to help future students see what kind of place they were heading into.

"I wanted to be the person to show them how great FIU is," she said.

When her sophomore year was over and she had peer advising and DM under her belt, Morffi ran for her first seat in student government. She got 1,400 votes, the most any representative at large candidate won that year, and beat out Nilo Cuervo, Alejandro Diaz and Felix Rodriguez.
She says she enjoyed the position. Morffi served on the student union committee, one of the many she feels is an important part of student government. "[The student union] is the core of spirit and campus life," Morffi said.

She wants student input to be taken seriously before the plans to remodel the Graham Center are finalized.

Being a part of student government was also a learning experience for her.

"It gives you a chance to get to meet new people and get to know the system," Morffi said. "Once you get to know the system, you get to see why the administartion acts the way they do and why students need to fight for what they want."

Morffi is excited about her new duties as student government president. She'll take over at the end of the spring semester.

"I think it'll be a great year," she said. "I take it as a chance and a challenge to make things happen."

Headline: Morffi wins, Rodriguez loses UP presidency by 162 votes
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Morffi! Omar! Morffi! Omar!

That was the sound that reverberated all through the Graham Center last Thursday as the results of the Student Government Association elections were announced about 30 minutes late. That was the sound that marked the end of a legacy for the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. For the first time in  nine years, a Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity member was defeated in a student government election for president.

The students voted in Jessica Morffi and Omar Castillo, an Alpha Zi Delta and an independent. 

"It made me feel happy that there's change," Morffi said, "not saying that a good job hasn't been done. It's a good feeling that we were strong enough to break that."

Morffi and Castillo won the election by 162 votes. Armando Rodriguez and Maria Garcia garnered 47.38 percent. Ironically, this is the second time Morffi earns more votes than Rodriguez. Last year, she got 296 more votes than him in the representative at large election.

Although 298 more votes were cast at University Park this year, the election was closer for the president and vice president. Last year, Victor Romano and Diego Martinelli defeated Bettina Inlcan and Jonathan Gaviria by 497 votes.

After Wilkes made his announcement, blue and gold colored balloons dropped from the ceiling of the GC Pit and dozens of screaming students ran in to hug and kiss the winners.

"[Winning] feels amazing," Morffi said, tears beginning to form under her eyes. "A lot of hard work and dedicated amazing people helped us win."
Student Affairs Vice President Hellen Ellison announced the winners in the other categories.

Of the six students running for the representative at large positions, three could win seats. The winners are: Clayton Solomon, who currently serves as student government's Student Union chair, won 1,641 votes. Jorge Rosario, who currently serves as the council's staff writer, got 1,335 votes and Bill Wilson, who reports on the Student Programming Council's accomplishments to SGC won 1,195 votes.

The other three candidates, Jaimie Eson, Max Gauthier and Marlon Font did not make the cut. Eson garnered 1,099 votes, Gauthier 951 and Font 818.

Two student government interns, Jacqueline Sosa and Jessica Franchi-Alfaro won the two available lower division seats. Sosa earned 961 votes.

She led her closest opponent, Franchi-Alfaro by 446 votes.
 Sergio Balsinde, who has no experience within student government, won 470 votes; Simon Pineres another SGC intern won 416 and Reinaldo Villa got 364 votes. These three lost the election.

The College of Business seat was decided by 21 votes. Senen Garcia, who was president of the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity, defeated incumbent Samir Qureshi. Garcia won 147 votes, Qureshi 127.
Another incumbent, Adrian Arbide also lost his bid for reelection.  Luis Martinez won 50.68 percent of the vote, getting 149; Arbide got 34.69 percent of the vote, earning 102 and Shusheng Ye got 14.63 percent with 43 votes.

In the last contested race of the 2002 election, Damion Dunn, the council's housing representative this semester, defeated Arianne Britt by 36 votes. Britt received 70 votes and Dunn garnered 106.

Steve Ramirez ran unopposed for the College of Arts and Sciences seat, Christine Carbot did not have any competition in her bid for the College of Education seat as did Salman Azhar for the graduate student seat and Kimberly Huffington for the housing representative seat.

Headline: Ex-playmate talks about life with AIDS
Author: Marlynne Boyer / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On Tuesday, April 2, 2002, FIU held a lecture featuring ex-Playboy playmate Rebekkah Armstrong titled "Living with AIDS" in the Mary Ann Wolfe Theater as part of the Spring Fling series of events at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 
 
Rebekkah Armstrong, 35, through showing a brief documentary film of her struggle with the debilitating disease, explained to FIU students her life story on how she contracted HIV and how it developed into full blown AIDS over a period of 19 years.
"I do not remember what it feels like to feel good.  I do not remember what it feels like to not feel tired," Armstrong said in her documentary.

Brief clips in the film showed an 18-year-old Armstrong as Miss September 1986 posing for provocative photos in lingerie and swimsuits for Hugh Hefner's Playboy magazine. The film revealed the contrast between her "top of the world" lifestyle as a blonde centerfold beauty and then the harsh reality of being reduced to AZT drugs and lesions brought on by AIDS.

In 1989, Armstrong at 22 discovered that she was HIV+.  She had contracted HIV through having unprotected sex with her boyfriend at the age of 16. She didn't realize that she had contracted the disease at first.  All she knew was that she had been tired lately and missed a few menstrual periods.  

"I knew that something must have been really wrong for me to be missing my menstrual periods because I am a vegetarian," she said. 

She had tests done and when her doctor called her, her doctor said she was positive.  At first, she thought that she was pregnant until the doctor clarified what she meant by 'positive.'  She told Armstrong that she tested positive for the HIV virus.

"When she told me—I lost it.  I knew I was gonna die," Armstrong said.  

At first, Armstrong overdosed on her AZT medication and drank heavily to drown her pain.  She ended up developing brain and intestinal infections from heavy partying.  She felt that living with HIV was too much for her to handle, so she decided to commit suicide. 

"I overdosed on AZT drugs and cocktails and then intentionally crashed my car.  I remember begging the paramedics to please let me die," Armstrong said.

After she recovered, she came to terms with her reality. 

"The most empowering words I said were 'Hi, my name is Rebekkah and I have AIDS,'" she said.  

She began lecturing at colleges, high schools and community centers.  

"I figured what better person to talk to you about sex than a playmate?" 

When Armstrong left Playboy, Hugh Hefner offered her support and prayer.

Rebekkah talked about HIV medicines because she has used five different cocktails to combat the disease.  She talked about how DDI ruptured her pancreas, how Viraset gave her digestive problems, and how it costs her $7,000 a year for cocktails.  


"Having AIDS is expensive.  Another reason why you should protect yourself," she said in a joking matter.  She takes out a condom, puts it over her hand, and stretches it down to her elbow.

"If I am able to stretch a condom this much, a man should be able to protect himself no matter 'how big' he claims to be," Armstrong said.

"The government doesn't want to give our kids this information about HIV and AIDS.  But this is not strictly about sex, it's about giving your kids information to save their lives," she said.

She pulled out a paper folded in half that had some statistics from the Center for Disease Control.


"These are some scary numbers you guys.  36.1 million people are estimated to be living with HIV and 1.4 million of these are under 15.  Women are ten times more likely to contract HIV than men.  47% of the people living with HIV and/or AIDS are women.  The key word is estimated," she said.

Standing on the stage, Rebekkah flexed her 13-inch biceps.  

"HIV is a catabolic disease, meaning that it eats muscle. When I learned that, I went straight to the gym and hit the weight room," she said.

Overall, the lecture by Armstrong was more than just a lecture on HIV and AIDS.  It was about the life story of an ex-playmate, who, when coping with AIDS managed to have the courage to inform others on how to save their lives.

"Seeing it in real life is different from what you've heard and read.  And because she looks so great, she beats the stereotype of a profile AIDS person," said Natilia Chambers, 20.

	"From the beginning to end, information didn't stop for me.  We also wanted to get to know her.  She did a wonderful job of getting her point across and she is an incredible person," said Guerlyn Ganthier, a freshman.

"I saw her at UM two years ago and she was awesome.  Her just being a playboy playmate and yet having the publicity and clout to talk about sex and HIV—I mean, people look at her and realize that she's a real person," said Alexander Lewy, junior.

Demetrice Morrison, 25, a registered dietician at Memorial Pembroke brought her two sisters to the lecture.  Both of her sisters said they learned something new about AIDS since they listened to Armstrong's lecture.

"I didn't know it was a catabolic disease," said Damika, 17.  

"I didn't know about all the symptoms of HIV," said Deshawn, 15.

"What surprised me was how good she looks and for someone who has lived with the disease for so long—I mean, any guy would have talked to her," said Brochner Louidor, 21.

Headline: BBC celebrates Spring Fling
Author: Sheaon Reid / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Last Monday marked the beginning of Spring Fling Week. The week's events kicked off with a carnival held outside of Panther Square, followed by a lecture by an ex-Playboy playmate on Tuesday and closed with a concert featuring Jamaican reggae artist Beenie Man on Thursday. 

The Student Programming Council  sponsors Spring Fling Week. Chairperson Johanne Civil said the purpose of Spring Fling is to give the students an opportunity to relax before finals. 

The carnival outside of Panther Square consisted of various food booths typical of a carnival including booths with popcorn, hotdogs, cotton candy and frosties. There was also face painting for those who were interested or who brought their children. 

The turnout was disappointing.

"There was a poor turnout at Monday's carnival," Sophmore Alexander Reyes said, "I said to myself, the music is good, the food is free and the school is trying to do something for us, why aren't more people here?"

Tuesday's lecture featured former playmate, Rebekkah Armstrong speaking to FIU students about her life with HIV. 

Armstrong began her lecture with a brief video clip of her life, from a star on top of the world to the harsh reality of being HIV positive. 

In terms of numbers, Thursday was the most successful with a sold-out concert featuring Beenie Man. 
"There was a strong presence of the Caribbean community present which showed the spirit of the north campus," Reyes said.  
Civil agrees Thursday's event was the most successful. "Despite the week's poor turnout, the concert was the most successful," said Civil. "We advertised everywhere including clubs, radio station, websites and everywhere students were going to be. Despite this we did not expect it to be sold out."

Headline: Carter looks forward to improving student services, beautifying campus
Author: Salome Antezana / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On April 4 Adrian Carter was reelected as president of the Student Government Council for the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Carter has been in office since last fall and ran unopposed for his second term. 

"I would not have minded having an opposing candidate," Carter said "but as an FIU student, I feel there should be more student participation." 

Carter joined SGC last summer as the vice-president, and later moved up to the presidency after Tito Omaghoni was removed from office.

His main concern is obtaining a system that works properly by restructuring its internal organization. 

"The university needs to maximize its ability to generate education at both campuses," Carter said. "Distance and communication can be a challenge to overcome, since most decisions are made at the south campus." 

He said there seems to be a feeling of detachment between the two campuses.

 "SGC's vision is to make BBC feel a part of the university and be given leadership and authority to make decisions," Carter said. 

Other important points in his agenda are improving services for students like housing, classes offered and the number of sections available, particularly in the College of Business, and College of Health and Urban Affairs.

The latter will be moving to the University Park Campus and he considers it fundamental that some of the classes should still be offered at BBC.
The beautification of Academic One, is also primary issue on his agenda, as well as raising money for scholarships and working towards raising a higher comfort level for international students. 

One of the SGC's major accomplishments so far is the addition of six new scholarships, two for international students, two more for in-state students and two for out-of-state students he said. 

Multi-cultural Programs and Services Associate Director Dr. Deryl Hunt has worked closely  closely with SGC and Carter to raise funds for scholarships. 

"He is a loyal, respectful, honorable person who seeks to treat people fairly," Hunt said.

During his first term as president, Carter worked with SGC on ongoing projects such as ensuring that the handicapped room in the library is ADA compliant, the addition of a stamp machine on campus and other issues he has yet to identify.

Vice President-elect Alexander Lewy said Carter has "commanded [the] respect of the council and has been able to lead us reshaping us into a more productive entity,  accomplishing many missions."

Carter said he is very proud of the new group of students that actively participate in the SGC. He mentioned that two thirds of the group are new and have never participated in a school organization before but are putting in a lot of effort as a team. 

Campus Life and Orientation Assistant Director Rafael Zapata has been working with Carter for about two years. He said one of SGC's major accomplishments has been teamwork.

 "Adrian has put in a lot of effort to get the council members to work really hard together," he said.

Carter is in his junior year in the School of Journalism and Mass Communications  and has plans to attend law school after he graduates from FIU.

Headline: Dance Marathon raises $86,000
Subheadline: Student-run group nearly doubles previous year's amount
Author: Robert Valencia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Over 250 FIU students began dancing and moving their feet for 25 hours at the fifth annual Dance Marathon held at the Golden Panther Arena Saturday to benefit the Miami Children's Hospital. DM started April 6th 12 p.m, and it ended on April 7th at 1 p.m.

DM's goal was to raise $75,000 dollars this year. The student-run philanthropy came up with $86,880.06.

"It was an amazing success compared to last year's total, which was about $48, 000," Michelle Arean, media and community affairs chair said. "We met our goal and passed it by about $11,000."

Sigma Phi Epsilon won this year's Miracle Cup.

DM was also honored with proclamations from the cities of Coral Gables, Key Biscayne, the City of Miami, Hialeah, Miami Lakes and North Miami Beach and other cities which name April 6 "Dance Marathon Day."

The overall committee members, which are students, oversee all aspects of the production including finance, public relations, internal coordination and facilities. Producing Dance Marathon requires a considerable number of hours in preparation and work.

The Children's Miracle Network supports Dance Marathon and aids in the implementation of the event.

Together, they work toward their common goal – to raise funds for children's hospitals all over the country. 

In the past 16 years, over $1.2 billion have been raised, helping 12 million kids a year at 170 children's hospitals. 

FIU's local CMN hospital is Miami Children's Hospital and all the money raised by DM will go directly to Miami Children's for equipment, medicine and the implementation of programs to help find cures for sick children.
"We are really happy to help our community, the money we raise can save a life and it fulfills the mission of Dance Marathon," DM Overall Director Bettina Inclan said. 

A recent addition to DM is the "Latinos Unidos Para Los Niños" (Latinos United for the Children), which is run by Manny Rosa, a University Housing coordinator for the University Park Towers.

This year, it provided for $1,300.00 in food, 500 plates and managed to "provide a good quality show that people would enjoy and want to come back to," Rosa said.

"I, along with Ms. Gisela Vega, assistant residence life director, came up with this marvelous program and from there we formed an excellent program," Rosa said.

Latinos Unidos Para Los Niños raised $527 for DM.

Students liked being able to see who their donations would be able to help.

"It's cool to see kids around here," Tere Lima, a student, said. "I can see what's going on."

Arean said this year was a bit different for DM.

"Sept. 11 caused many huge Dance Marathon sponsors [not] to donate to us, [because] they have donated to funds for Sept. 11."

Arean said numerous organizations participated such as fraternities and sororities, housing and the Student Organizations Council.

"We tried to steer away from it being a greek event," Arean said.
Christine Carbot was named DM 2003's overall director. Carbot  was recently elected as student government's College of Education representative.

Headline: BBC president reelected
Subheadline: 255 Biscayne Bay students vote in SGC election
Author: Adrienne Celaya / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Votes have been counted and next year's Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council has been elected.

Out of the 3,402 FIU students that voted in SGC's elections last week, only 255 were from BBC. 

President Adrian Carter received the largest number of votes with 209, followed by Representative at Large Kerry Brown with 189 votes, and Vice President Andrew Lewy with 188 votes. 

Students elected Mfonobong Essiet as one of their Lower Division Representatives with a total of 130 votes. 

There will be a runoff in that same category between Lissette Hernandez and Clayton "Hank" Schramm, both of whom received six votes.
With 21 votes, Rasheedah Muhammad was elected for another term as the College of Health and Urban Affairs Representative, as was Nazly de la Rosa for the School of Journalism and Mass Communications seat with 29 votes. 

Neil Harrison was elected as representative for the School of Hospitality and Management with 24 votes and with 25 votes Muhammed Malik became the College of Arts and Sciences Representative.
Assistant Director of Campus Life and Orientation Rafael Zapata attributes the low voter turnout to the many uncontested positions this year. 

He said it was hard to convince students to vote when only two positions had more than one candidate running.

"Some people would walk up to the booth and then walk away when they saw that there weren't many candidates to choose from," Zapata said. 
Junior Precious Dunn didn't participate in elections because of the number of people running.

"It just seems like no one is running against the candidates. So what's the point?" Dunn said.

"I didn't vote because I don't have the time," freshman Daniela Danbrea said.

Zapata said he believes there are two main reasons for the lack of candidates this year – apathy and contentment. Some students at BBC were just not interested in running for office, while others were happy enough with the candidates running. Zapata said many of the council members didn't want to run for president or vice president because they liked Adrian Carter's performance this last term and because Andrew Lewy is well respected.

Carter said he also thinks student apathy is a main reason for the shortage of candidates.

This is where Carter said the two-way road comes in. Students have to be aware and react.

"Students are concerned, but they don't take the time or put in the effort necessary to address their concerns," Carter said. 

In reference to the lack of elections advertising, Carter said although he believes student government can always do a better job of getting the students involved, it is also the responsibility of the student to take action.

"It is a two-way street. The students should know what's going on. Every junior and senior should know that SGC elections take place every year in the spring," Carter said. "The majority of the sophomores should also know."

Carter said students have to get involved at the lowest level, which is simply knowing what's going on with their student government. 
Each campus also has an elections committee whose duties include informing the public about elections along with the candidates themselves.

Carter added that students tend to overlook things because the campus is saturated with information.  

The SGC plans to correct this problem by creating an information center specifically for student government.

However, some of the 255 students who did vote had ulterior motives. When asked why he decided to vote in the SGC elections, junior Giovanni Molinari had a few words to say.

"You want the truth? Free food," Molinari said.

Like every other event at BBC, food was served to all those who showed up to cast their ballots. Some students viewed this as an incentive, others as a treat, but all were able to enjoy chicken wings and fruit salad.
