Headline: Seven ranked teams, five in top 25, lined up for men's soccer
Author: Yanely Perez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Entering their 33rd season, the men's soccer team along with Head Coach Karl Kremser will have their hands full next season as the NCAA tournament participants will face numerous ranked teams this season.

The Golden Panthers have much to look forward to as they face 18 games, seven of which include teams being ranked by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) last season and five that finished in the top 25. 

Ten games will be held at home this season where the team played strongly last season finishing with a 10-2-1 record. The men will participate in four tournaments, two of which will be held at University Park.

According to team captain Allen Handy, the tougher the teams, the more he welcomes the opportunity.

"There are a few teams to look out for, those being St. John [Oct. 29], North Carolina [Sept. 10], and Hartwick [Nov. 12], where we will face maximum opposition,but with enough team effort we are bound to turn out successful," said Handy.

Before starting off their regular season, FIU will use two late-August scrimmages as a final tune-up in preparation. They will take on Division II National Champions Lynn in Boca Raton on Aug. 23 and then face Nova Southeastern at home on Aug. 27. 

The Golden Panthers will then open the regular season as hosts of the FIU Diadora Classic as they face in-state rivals Florida Atlantic on Sept. 3 and Georgia State on Sept. 5.

The Golden Panthers will then travel to Chapel Hill, NC for the Carolina Nike Classic, where they will take on competitive teams in North Carolina and Wake Forest, all taking place on Sept. 12. 

They continue their four-game road trip with another tournament at the USF-Holiday Inn Invitational in Tampa, as they face Alabama A&M and Southern Methodist.

Athletic Director Rick Mello considers the Carolina Nike Classic a crucial match up to see where the team is at as far as expectations go.

"After talking with Coach Karl Kremser and some of the players, their expectations as well as minds are in hope for a good season. FIU's Men's Soccer seems to be good contenders for National Honors. 

The St. John North Carolina tournament will be considered a very important tournament when considering just how put-together this team can really be," said Mello.

The regular season includes conference games against familiar opponents Oneonta State, Adelphi and Harwick.

With veteran players returning, the team is expected to be ready when called upon.

"It is important that we stay focused and don't experience any mental laps. With seven starters returning for FIU this year, the team will be as focused and prepared as we need to be," said Handy.

&nbsp;
Who says a lean body requires rigorous hours at the gym? You don't need to bear the "burn" of weightlifting or the sun's heat to get in shape. Just stroll by Panther Arena any day of the week and have fun  while burning calories. 

Take your pick between carbohydrate killing racquetball or wood-floored glass-backboard basketball games, both shaded and fully air-conditioned. All supplies are provided free of charge to students.

"It's the coolest," boasts Jeff West, senior. "We get racquets and a private court. All free!"

Before you go rushing to the arena, appointments are required for racquetball, unless no one is playing at the time. 

With two floors worth of basketball courts and four personal racquet rooms, just about anytime is a good time. 

"I'm usually looking for a game during my two-hour break," said senior Armando Chavez. 

Showers are also available free of charge in the male and female locker rooms. 

Courts begin to fill up at night time when students are usually off from school.

"It's usually full after five p.m," said senior and employee Cherisse Allard. "Lately I'm seeing some new faces turn into regulars." 

"There's usually games going on all day, but its easiest to find people at night," said Junior Kenny Richards.

Besides indoor games and activities, there are outdoor facilities that include tennis and basketball courts courts, racquetball and large areas where you and your friends can set up games from football to soccer. 

Besides playing games, students enjoy meeting new people.

"I like the fact that I can play and socialize in the same place. I've made some cool friends from playing in the arena," said Allard.

Sporting tournaments are held throughout the year. 3-on-3 basketball, 6-on-6 volleyball, flag football, racquetball, soccer and more are available for students interested in creating or joining a team.

Headline: Football team approved for I-A status
Author: Harry Coleman / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The football team picked up their first win this season without even playing their first game. FIU received word from the NCAA this past week that the application for Division I-A football status had been approved.

Averaging 15,000 in attendance, having 16 intercollegiate sport teams and awarding 200 full athletic scholarships - at least 76 in football- are three major rules FIU must comply with in a two-year reclassification period in order to maintain I-A status permanently.

FIU was waived out of one rule for the first year of reclassification, which is having five I-A home games. The rule will be applied for the second season.

"This news gives us the go ahead," said Athletic Director Rick Mello. "The NCAA is looking at our approach and we just have to put our steps in place."

FIU plans to become members of the current Sun Belt Conference football institution. FIU and Florida Atlantic University are on schedule to become football members in 2005.

The Golden Panthers will play a full schedule of SBC games in 2005 and will be eligible I-A level bowl members in 2006. The SBC is one of 11 conferences to sponsor football at the I-A level.

It only took FIU two years to begin the transition to I-A level, something Mello is proud of achieving.

"We are the fastest university in history to try it. From a competitive standpoint we have to catch up," said Mello. "We have two years to prove ourselves."

FIU will begin the season with a statewide-televised game against Jacksonville on Sept. 2 here at the FIU Cage. This year the schedule includes games against three I-A teams, all from the SBC, and four I-AA schools who finished last season ranked nationally in the Top-25.

Headline: Tompos joins Coach Stevens as assistant
Author: Natalia Sabia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Adding a masculine ambiance to FIU's women's volleyball team this season is Assistant Coach Greg Tompos.  

Joining the team from Australia, Greg holds numerous amounts of experience coaching volleyball here in the states, as well as overseas. 

"I'm very happy to have him on board," said Women's Volleyball Head Coach Cookie Stevens.  

Tompos was successful in Australia, leading his team to a silver medal in the 2002 AVL Finals and earning two bronze medals in both 2001 and 2003, but felt he was ready for yet, another coaching role.  

"I wanted to be somewhere exciting," said Tompos who most recently finished his three-year tenure as head coach for the Canberra Heat of the Australian Volleyball League. 

As for Stevens, she is very excited to have another coach around.  Last year the team finished under .500 with a 13-16 record, a stat that can improve with the success of Tompos working well with the team, something Stevens has seen already.

"I can already see that he'll work well with the girls," said Stevens. With the loss of last year's assistant coach, Stevens is anxious to hit the court with her new coach, along with the new members of her.  

"He's very good and he's very sufficient," added Stevens.

  Tompos began his coaching career in Ohio as a volunteer volleyball coach at the University of Dayton in 1999.  He spent five seasons as an assistant volleyball coach at the NCAA Division I Level when he was still a student at the University of Cincinnati.

 "I had a great time in Ohio, but I was interested in something new," said Tompos who was also a dedicated student athlete for the Bearcats' women's volleyball team as a student assistant when he was studying there.

Greg was not only a coach during college, but he was involved in coaching Cincinnati's very first boys' club team, The Cincinnati River Bandits, and later took a different role by switching from coaching men to women taking the role as coach of the River City Volleyball Club's Girls'.

Full of ambition and excitement, Greg headed off to Australia to take on another role.  Some of the activities he was involved in included coaching players on the Australian Beach Volleyball Tour, serving as National Junior Program Coordinator and working with the Australian Institute of Sport.

After a successful tenure in Australia where he gained experience, Greg was eager for another move. He wanted to bring his wife, who is an Australian native, to a city full of diverse people, which landed him here in Miami.

  "Miami is such an international and big city," said Tompos. "Once I visited, I thought it was so nice."

Settled here in Miami, Greg is enthusiastic for an exciting season. 

 "I've met almost all the girls from last season and I'm also excited for the new girls," said Tompos. 

 Entering a new role after coaching mostly men athletes versus women athletes, Stevens is confident Tompos has what it takes to enforce a successful season.  

"Everything will be new for him, but I look forward to it," said Stevens. 

 Along with the addition of several new players to the team, Greg is very hopeful he too can add a positive new spin.  

"I hope we can really be strong at the net this year," said Tompos who hopes he can help in that department this year.

Headline: Early retirement
Subheadline: Ricky Williams retires with two years left on his contract. He states that his son, drugs and the pounding he got the past two years were among the "hundred reasons" for retiring. C'mon Ricky, how good can the weed be to miss out on $6 million this season
Author: Harry Coleman / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Dolphin's off-season couldn't have gone any worse had they tried. Dave Wannstedt remains head coach; Dan Marino broke off his commitment faster than a Britney Spears marriage. 	

Then it took a second coach to replace the one that was hired to replace Norv Turner as offensive coordinator. Confusing? Exactly. Now to put the icing on the cake is Ricky Williams' retirement. 

Are you kidding me, how can number 34 with the famous dreads be leaving us, after only two seasons?

Run Ricky Run's retirement was done in the worst fashion. Announcing retirement one week before the start of training camp not only hurt the team by losing its star player, but it didn't give the Dolphins ample time to find a replacement, as they would have if lets say Williams had made his decision at the end of last season. 

Williams' actions have disappointed the coaching staff, his teammates and more importantly, the fans. As a die hard fan and season ticket holder, hearing of Ricky's retirement hurt more than when I got a root canal. 

  I think this whole situation is pathetic. He was going to make $3.5 million this upcoming season with bonuses that would total out to $6 million according to Foxsports.com. 

How good can the weed Ricky is smoking be? I'll tell you what; it better be darn good if its worth losing $6 million. He was going to play for a championship contender and be the star face of the Dolphins. He is in the prime of his career and has only played a total of five NFL seasons. 

Now, don't get me wrong, if a player wants to quit, then by all means go ahead. But please do it the professional way, two-week notices don't work in the NFL. 

Had he retired in January, as is the norm, it would have allowed the Dolphins to replace him when the NFL draft and free agency occurred. But this late in the game, everyone is signed.  

The Colt's Edgerrin James, who is one of the premiere running backs in the NFL, has expressed interest in joining Miami but is one year away from free agency. The Colt's have stated that he will not be traded leaving Miami with even more limited -- if any -- options. 

Williams' first stated that he was retiring to spend more time with his children and search for the truth and travel the world. Ironically, soon after came the breaking news that he had tested positive for marijuana use, for the third time. 

Williams told The Miami Herald, "I didn't quit football because I failed the drug test. I failed the drug test because I was ready to quit football." 

You know what Ricky? Forget the millions of fans that you let down, the teammates that were counting on you and forget the fact that you broke your word and commitment. We'll deal with the mess. 

Please go out and search for the truth. Please do. What's the worse that can happen? We have a bad season and Wannstedt gets fired? Oh well, that wouldn't be too bad.

Ricky William retires with yet two years left on his contract. He states that his son, drugs and the pounding he got the past two years were among the hundred of reason for retiring. Common Ricky, how good can the weed be to miss out on $6 million next season?

Headline: Student's determination to learn makes professor's day
Author: Lisa Edmunds / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Standing at the doors of the Golden Panther Arena Wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m., watching a tropical downpour as I waited for my last class of the day to make the trek from main campus to the 'outback' of campus. 

About a dozen students huddled in the doorway, waiting out the rain before making a mad dash to their cars or back to campus.

Out of the corner of my eye, I watched a lone, wet figure in a white t-shirt and jeans, navigating his way through the downpour and puddles, sloshing through the parking lots and path from main campus to GPA.

"Look at that guy," several students commented. "He must be crazy to walk in the rain like that, no umbrella, no raincoat."

Crazy like a fox, I thought, as I recognized the figure as one of my 2 p.m. students.

He was drenched, walking all the way to the arena from DM in a downpour, but by God, he made it to GPA on time for class.

He was, indeed, the ONLY student in the class to make it by 2 p.m.

Soaked to the bone, all he could do is laugh a little at his predicament, as he walked down the hallway into the classroom and tried to wring out his clothes.

He was, indeed, shocked to see the classroom empty, expect for me, but he knew I'd be there because I had a 12:30 class in the same room.

After a quick trip to the restroom for towels and to pass his shirt under the hand dryer for a moment, he returned to the classroom.

And still, he was the lone student.

Jokingly, he encouraged me to move along with the day's lesson, saying "I came to learn! I'll stay."

Over the next 15 minutes, a few other folks wandered in, all shocked to find me and The Wet Guy, discussing the assigned reading for the day, as planned.

"We have to stay?" they asked timidly.

"You bet!" was our response.

Again and again, The Wet Guy told them, "I'm staying. I came to learn!"

I can only dream on a classroom, somewhere, in a galaxy far, far away, where indeed every student would be dedicated enough to wring himself out, open his book, take out pen and notebook and say, "I came to learn..."

Headline: Kerry woos supporters at convention
Author: By Martin Merzer / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Sen. John Forbes Kerry, an enigmatic figure who came of age fighting in the Vietnam War, launched a thinly veiled attack on the Bush administration Thursday night as he sought to convince Americans that he's strong and resolute enough to lead a fractured nation again at war.

"As president, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House," Kerry told nearly 5,000 Democratic delegates and a prime-time television audience.

"I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war," he said. "I will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the advice of military leaders. And I will appoint an attorney general who will uphold the Constitution of the United States."

Accepting the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, locked in a statistical dead heat with President Bush in popularity polls, the Massachusetts senator devoted most of his speech to national security, the one area where polls show Bush retains a substantial advantage.

"I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president," he said. "Let there be no mistake. I will never hesitate to use force when it is required. Any attack will be met with a swift and a certain response."

After speaking for 46 minutes, Kerry concluded with a call to look beyond the horizon.

"For America," he said, "the hope is there. The sun is rising. Our best days are still to come."

And so, as 100,000 red, white and blue balloons floated through the FleetCenter, came the end of a Democratic festival that was, at least in its public presentation, notably harmonious.

Kerry, 60, hoped to define himself in the minds of the American people with this speech, the biggest of his life. And he hoped to touch them emotionally, attempting to identify with growing concerns about the wisdom and cost of the war in Iraq.

Repeatedly saying, "Help is on the way," Kerry offered aid and comfort to various segments of American society, particularly the armed forces. He spoke of ending a "backdoor draft of National Guard (troops) and reservists" who, he said, are ill-equipped and left without an exit strategy.

With the number of Americans killed in the war in Iraq now exceeding 900, he pledged to carry the nation into war only as a last resort.

He said: "Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say, `I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent.' So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war."

He offered the framework of a plan to get U.S. forces out of Iraq.

"I know what we have to do in Iraq," Kerry said. "We need a president who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, reduce the risk to American soldiers. That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home."

Kerry's speech had many missions.

One, foreshadowed throughout the convention by images of him in military combat and heavily spiced with references to "strength" and "optimism": to show that an aloof man who's known for nuanced views is capable of serving as America's point man in the wars on terrorism and in Iraq.

"We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances," Kerry said.  "And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists, `You will lose and we will win.'"	

As for his often-complex views: "Some issues just aren't that simple," he said. "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so. And proclaiming 'mission accomplished' certainly doesn't make it so."

Another objective of the speech: to attract support from independents and centrists by demonstrating that he and the Democrats are moderate, acceptable choices.

Toward that end, Kerry sketched his economic plan, promising to create new incentives for manufacturing and technology, to end tax preferences for companies that ship jobs overseas and to develop an energy plan focused on alternative fuels and "the cars of the future."

He promised to cut middle-class taxes, to roll back tax cuts for the wealthy, not to privatize Social Security, to control rising health-care costs, to allow people to import prescription drugs from Canada and to create "jobs that pay you more, not less, than you earned before."

"It is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families," he said.

He offered no estimates of the cost of these programs. His message was less one of detail than of ideas, ideals and promises.

"I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush," he said. "In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. ...

"My friends, the high road may be harder but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, region from region, group from group."

Republicans portray Kerry as a tax-and-spend liberal and a serial flip-flopper lacking in political conviction, a man who voted in favor of the Iraq war but not for additional money to wage it. Kerry says he wanted to pay the cost by rolling back some of Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy, but when that failed, he refused to add the cost to the national debt.

"A month from now, we're going to have our convention in New York and we're going to run on President Bush's record," former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said at a Republican news conference in Boston. "We're not going to run away from it as they have been doing for the last four nights."

The Democrats exploited Kerry's combat duty, sensing an advantage over Bush-who served only in the Air National Guard-and the military-tinged, almost macho imagery that had pervaded this convention endured to the end.

Headline: Phi Sigs provide glimpse of upcoming sorority Rush Week
Author: Julia Marchese / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Along with other FIU sororities, the Penguins of Phi Sigma Sigma have found themselves  readying for what they consider will become an eventful summer's end.

Besides preparing for their annual awards ceremony taking place this year in Washington on August 1, the Penguins have begun to plan for the Greek Life Rush Week for the fall semester, which begins September 7. As part of these plans, members have taken time between their weekly chapter and executive meetings, academic affairs, and such events as their annual fashion show to prepare for a one week extravaganza held in honor of potential members. 

The week will kick off its string of events with Sorority 101. Active members from all six FIU sororities, including the Phi Sigs, have the opportunity during this event to meet and greet the potential members for a designated amount of time. 

On the second night, Philanthropy Night, both potential and returning members for Phi Sigma Sigma will work together in an effort to produce an arts-and-crafts project for the National Kidney Foundation, the charitable organization supported yearly by the sorority.

At the end of the event, prospective members will have the chance to judge the sororities on their efforts, ranking their favorite four sororities in the number one slot, followed by one sorority for each second and third place.

The third day consists of a semiformal affair, the Dessert Night. Incoming members will here eliminate two sororities from a list of possible groups they might join, leaving two sororities in the top of their list, and again one group in the second and third slots of their list.

As the elimination process takes place, active sisters of the sororities are expected to interact more closely with the interested parties over cookies and cake. 

Preference Night is also a semiformal event considered by the Greek groups to be the most personal night of the week. 

Potential members, reviewing the presentations given by each sorority, narrow their top four choices down to two.

Some alumnae members will return to campus that evening in order to assist in such tasks as serving food and drinks, thus giving active sisters a chance to focus on the new students.

For the Phi Sigma Penguins, an "open ritual" is planed to take place on this night, providing the sorority sisters with an opportunity to discuss the experiences they have had in their time as members.

"I never thought I'd be this involved in my sorority," said Larissa Hernandez, president of Phi Sigma Sigma. "Being so involved has allowed me to speak to others from my personal experience."

Bid Day, the final event of Rush Week, gives current sorority members the chance to decide as a whole who will be invited into their chapter. 

After the bidding process has taken place, the girls  will celebrate with the new additions to their organization.

"Being part of the excitement of Rush Week has helped me to appreciate my memories and experiences as a Phi Sig," said Sandra Alonso, a senior, regarding her past times in the group.

Subheadline: FIU makes history as Chinese government approves building of new Hospitality School
Author: Anamirella Marquez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With shovels held between white-gloved hands, smiling for the cameras, FIU administrators and members of the Tianjin University of Commerce announced the groundbreaking for the future FIU School of Hospitality and Tourism Management campus in Tianjin, China. 

FIU President Modesto A. Maidique and Joseph West, dean of the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, traveled to China to sign a 10-year contract agreeing to the building of a new campus to FIU's specifications and for the groundbreaking on the future site of that very campus.

"We are the first foreign University that the Chinese are investing $25 million in," said West.

The FIU School of Hospitality will be built near the Tianjin Univeristy of Commerce.

Currently, the campus is set to be approximately 80 acres in size and will carry a cost of around $25 million; funding will come from China.  

"This is a great opportunity for all FIU students, not only for the Asian students going [to attend]," said Kay Jung, a graduate student. 

The school is set to open fall of 2006 and will admit around 1,000 students.

According to Lee C. Dickson, the associate dean, students attending the school  will first attend two years in the University of Commerce, taking courses which will be equivalent to the FIU undergraduate core curriculum.

These transfer students will apply for admission and follow the same procedures as any other transfer student; the only difference being that they won't have to travel to Miami. 

The Tianjin courses will require each student to speak English because all classes will be taught in that language.

Students will also receive their bachelor's and master's degrees from FIU.

"[This] gives students the chance for international education, which is important. Travel and tourism is worldwide and this just gives an out reach for students," said Rachel Leung, a junior. 

FIU is set to begin the selection and interviewing process for potential faculty. Some of the prospective candidates will be taking classes and even finishing their master's degree in the U.S., at FIU, starting January 2005. Also, they will be learning the curriculum and working with other members of the faculty. 

"It's very exciting for our program, that we have this possibility of having the FIU School of Hospitality and Tourism Management in China [which is] going to open great opportunities," said Elisa Moncarz, a Hospitality Management professor who also acknowledges the global exposure this move will gain for the university.

Dean West states how, during a conference organized by professor Jinlin Zhao and co-sponsored by the International Hotel and Restaurant association held in China, the dean of Hospitality at TUC spoke with Professor Zhao about the awareness China has had on FIU's hospitality department.

"The Dean of Hospitality at TUC spoke at length with Professor Zhao. They knew about our large number of alumni's based in Asia, we are well known," saidWest   

According to Dickson, China had their pick of many top schools to partner up with.

In the end, however, they chose FIU for (among other reasons) holding a curriculum based on the reception of transfer students.

The administration claims that this partnership will not only bring great prestige to FIU, but it will also raise the general funds for both FIU campuses.

As stated by the mutual contract, FIU is set to not only place the specifications on the building but also to collect tuition from the program.

With China currently readying itself for what has been called an approaching booming tourism decade (Beijing having been chosen as the next venue for the 2008 Olympics), the FIU negotiations for a campus in the country's third largest city has been sustained as a preparation for the future.

"It will benefit us in that our Chinese alumni will shape China's tourism in the next 20 years," said West.

Headline: Sinister hairstyle reborn into trendy fashion faux pas
Author: Sam Sessa / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
It came from the `80s, clawing its way onto skulls everywhere.

Business in the front, party in the back.

The mullet.

For a decade we felt the shockwaves. From Michael Bolton to Mel Gibson to Joe the local auto mechanic, the mullet's power stretched far and wide. And now, just when we thought our scalps were safe, the mullet is once again riding high.

"It never quite goes and it comes back again," said Mark Larson, co-author of "The Mullet: Hairstyle of the Gods." "It's kind of like what they say about the evolution of roaches. They've been here since the dinosaurs, and they just keep adapting. The mullet adapts."

So the style has mutated from the traditional mullet of short hair in front, cropped above the ears, and long hair in back, cascading over the shoulders. This time around we're dealing with a different breed: the shag mullet. Most popular with young men, the bangs hang just below the eyebrows, while the back creeps down to the shoulders.

 As with most trends, we have celebrities to thank. This summer former `N Sync member JC Chasez and Maroon 5 guitarist James Valentine wore mullets at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater. Actor John Hensley of TV's "Nip/Tuck" and Everclear frontman Art Alexakis are now doing the same.

It could almost be passed off as shaggy hair. Almost.

"Some people are leaving it covering their ears, but it's still long in the back," said Dana Yates, who has been styling hair for 12 years and now works in Westport, Mo. "It's more flowy."

Jake Nelson of Kansas City, Mo., loves his shag mullet, which he has had for about six months now.

 "It's a way to say kinda `(expletive befitting a mullet-wearing rebel) you' to the man," Nelson said.

He's one half of a tag-team family mullet - his 11-year-old son, Brenden, also rocks the shag.

"I'm really proud of my son's mullet," Nelson said. "I want him to grow it into a rat-tail mullet down his back."

While Nelson wears his hair with pride, plenty of young men are in denial, Yates said. They see the shag on television and ask for hair like Ashton Kutcher of "That `70s Show" or Brad Pitt's from the movie "Spy Game." They think it's just shaggy hair, but what they're really getting is the shag mullet.

And then there are the accidental mullets. Your hair naturally grows longer in the back and shorter in the front, because of the natural hairline, Yates said. She has had many people with accidental mullets come into her salon - especially women.

"The funny thing is, all I have to do is cut the back off and they're like, `Oh my , it looks so much better,' " she said.

But the mullet may soon be trendy for women as well. Already models in Paris and people in New York and Los Angeles are sporting cropped bangs with a waterfall in the back, said Joyce Sander, a hairstylist in Leawood, Kan.

The Midwest mullet for women - if it hits - might not surface until next year, Sander said, given the speed of other hair trends, but once here, hairstyles usually stay for three to four years.

 Jennifer Aniston's "Rachel" hairstyle stuck for about four years, followed by the Cameron Diaz short hair spikes, which people still request, she said.

The modern mullet probably came from David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust phase in the early `70s. Kutcher may be responsible for bringing on the shag mullet, but there is no one man fully credited with sparking the resurgence.

 The movie business may have its finger on the pulse.

"Hollywood knows about the mullet in an intuitive way," author Larson said. "It's the haircut that they give to the guy who's the outsider, the outcast with the heart of gold. They always do that. That's the essence of the mullet. It's always on the fringe, but with a heart of gold, and that's why it never goes away. It believes in itself."

Headline: Second anime convention focuses on Japanese rock
Author: Angie Hargot / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In a modest auditorium at the University Park campus, a group of about 50 people sit interspersed alone or in small groups in the dark.  Their faces light up sporadically in laughter as the characters on the screen - children with pink and blue hair - play with Molotov cocktails and become the target of mild sexual innuendo.  (The characters are animated, of course.)    

Based over 7,467 miles from Japan, this August will mark the second time one FIU club will hold their annual convention, Yasumi Con, to celebrate and explore an often curious phenomenon of Japanese culture - Anime.

Anime has been described as at best, animated Japanese art with a storyline, and at worst - cartoons for adults. In Japanese with English subtitles "anime always seems to have a bad reputation for being either extremely childish or for mature audiences only," said Teresa Montgomery, Webmaster and Events Coordinator for Florida International University's Anything Goes Anime Film Club (AGA). "There is a point in between and that's what we show."

Whatever the explanation, the Anything Goes Anime Film Club took on official club status in 1997.  Every Thursday from 8-11 p.m. in GC 140, you can catch a free showing of what the members have voted on for the week. Typically you'll see part of a series, which spans 13-26 episodes. Typically you'll see something you'll never see on American television.

The anime shown is usually OAV (Only Available on Video) and is generally not shown in the States.  The club's name itself comes from one popular series called Ranma .  In the series, whenever a young martial arts expert named Ranma Saotome gets splashed with cold water, he changes into a pretty young girl. Getting splashed with hot water reverses the effect (until the next episode).  "Anything Goes," is the name of the dojo where he trains.   

Membership in Anything Goes is free and includes discounts at local stores and voting privileges. "They send you stuff through e-mail, like updates, and the anime they're showing," said Austin Blake, a Junior.  This summer the club's roll stands at 65 members. Blake plans to attend Yasumi Con. 

The word "yasumi" is Japanese for "vacation," and scheduled towards the end of the summer break, the convention is fittingly named.  Last year the convention drew over 1,000 patrons, twice as many as expected. Many patrons donned the costumes of Anime characters such as Milly from the Trigun series, or acted in skits dressed as characters from popular video games.  The 2003 convention was so successful they had to add a venue for one event and expand it to two days this year. 

"There was always talk of starting one with the older members," Montgomery said of the fledgling convention.  "One day I just thought, hey wait. We can do this."

This year's convention is Japanese rock (or J-rock) inspired.  The theme is appropriate in the wake of the rising interest in J-rock thanks in part to films like Kill Bill, which showcased the '50's motivated band "The 5,6,7,8's," and magazines such as "Tokyo Pop" which keep American fans up-to-date on bands like "Shonen Knife" and "Guitar Vader." 

	At the Anything Goes meetings, you can feel the excitement of club members in anticipation of the event.  The audience discusses elements of the film openly and even breaks out into spontaneous dancing as the theme music plays.  "When the mood is right dancing can always happen," warns Blanchard.

The convention promises all kinds of anime-related events, including a costume contest and film showings.  The complete schedule is on the convention's website.   

"There's a dealer room, and an anime-related game room," said club member Alex Orta.  Orta is in his second year at FIU.      

Putting on a convention is no easy task for a group of just six club members, however.  They had to find sponsors, set up events and figure out how to accommodate droves of Anime fans - in costume.  The organizers received a good deal of help from SOC as well as the Asian Studies Department.  Internally, the club had administrative obstacles to overcome.  "We have an excellent executive board this year and the incoming board for 2004-05 is poised and ready to carry on the momentum created last year," said Kelly Blanchard, a senior and the AGA Secretary for 2004-05.

The two day convention kicks off on August 14th in the Graham Center Ballrooms at the University Park Campus. Registration is free and available at www.yasumicon.com.
