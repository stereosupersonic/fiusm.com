Headline: Group projects waste students' time, hinder personal lives
Author: David Pulgar
&nbsp;
What causes more worry for a student than a final exam? Group projects. I'm not just talking about one project either. I'm talking about three, four or sometimes even five projects at a time.


The fact that students get so much work makes me believe our professors think we are all Superman or Wonderwoman: Able to leap large distances in a single bound to meet with our group. Faster than the speed of light so we can meet with one group at Biscayne Bay Campus and then make it to our next group meeting 15 minutes later at University Park. Stronger than the power of sleep as we stay up until 3 a.m. picking up the slack of people who did not work in our groups.


I don't mind working for my grades. Nor am I complaining about the volume of work that I receive. But I'm wondering how students can be expected to perform effectively in a group when we don't have time to meet. 


Add this to work, other class assignments, exams and a personal life, and what does that leave you with? 


Students are not robots. We don't live just to execute tasks, get an "A" and go home. There is also more than one way of learning. Professors don't have to bombard us with the excess assignments they think will benefit us. 


Students should be trusted more to prepare themselves for a career on their own time. If you want to develop interpersonal skills, get an internship or a job related to your field. 


I don't want professors wasting my time with meaningless group assignments. Who wants to have 25 percent of their grade based on the performance of a group of five people each of who has at least three other groups they are worrying about?



Not to say that all group projects are bad. Some classes can only work effectively through group projects, but professors should re-evaluate their syllabi to make sure they aren't giving worthless assignments. Schools and colleges within the university should coordinate to make sure they aren't doubling up on projects. 


We are not just students coming to get an education here; we are customers paying for services. Students shell out at least $75 a credit to get an education, and we expect it to be worth the investment.  


To my knowledge, our university has never conducted a study to see what a student's life is like. Perhaps if they understand how we work, they can better tailor their systems to our lives. 


Students must work in order to have experience useful to them after graduation. We can no longer study for four years and expect to have a job waiting for us when we graduate. Times are changing and the concept of a student must change with it. 


We are not ignorant children wanting to learn about how the world works. We are members of society who know what is expected of us. We have jobs, families and lives. So give us a break. If we can't play well with others by now, then what hope do we have to succeed in the future anyway?

Headline: Parking fines should be lowered
Author: Lorraine Rodriguez
&nbsp;
You are in the car going through different parking lots. Graham Center's lot is full as always, Chemistry and Physics has cars in the grass for the lack of space, and we don't have to even mention the business parking lot - only a bike can find a spot there. 

By this time you are late for your 11 a.m. class and smoking your second cigarette out of hopelessness. Desperate, you look out and see many faculty parking spots available, so you think, "Why not?" After all, it's just one class, so you park in a faculty spot and get to class suffering from fatigue (partly due to the cigarettes).

Two hours later, you come back and have one of those despicable yellow envelopes on the front glass of your car...again.

If this situation repeats two or three times every semester, you'll be paying $100-$120 to the Parking and Traffic department. Thus if you are a naive freshman, by the time you graduate you will have paid $400-$500 in parking fines. 

So where does all this money go? To build a new house for the president? To add a new expansion to the bookstore?

Why didn't they build another parking garage instead? It seems like the problem is too many students, and if that is the case, then the school shouldn't admit more students than what it can handle. 

 Señor Maidique, please address our needs, not your particular interests.

Let me stress the word 'needs,' because that is exactly what parking is: a necessity. We need to have enough parking lots. We don't have them, and on top of it we get fined because the university is not doing its job to satisfy this demand.

Faculty is not exempt from this chaos. At least our decal is included in our fees. Professors have to pay for their right to have a parking space at work. They get tickets as we do. My photography professor has four tickets for lack of a decal; the next one earns her the privilege of a boot on her pick-up truck and the $50 that comes with it. 

University administration, please use your  sense for something other than taking money out of students' pockets. Understand that most of us don't earn five-digit salaries, so a $20 fine is too much. If the students are your main concern, act accordingly because this is not the way to show it. 

Students should have their voices heard. If the Student Government Council is not ensuring that this happens, we should take action. Protest, petition for lower fines, go on a hunger strike, but do something! Don't pretend nothing is happening while your money is being stolen.

As for me, this is the last semester that I have to park closer to KFC than to any of my classrooms. Dec. 14 will be my last day. In the meanwhile, I'll keep hiding along with my professor from the evil eye of the Parking and Traffic department.

Professor commends FIU for providing open forum

To the editor:

Contributing Writer Rene Diaz Iturrey's alarmist headline and obvious cold war rhetoric are symptomatic of the hysteria that an ever-diminishing number of Cuban exiles respond with to any perceived aperture regarding Cuba.  

Amidst such hard and fast ideological battle lines, the transcendent issues of freedom of speech and the right to lawful assembly are easily obscured. 

 The idea of the university as forum for the critical debate of controversial ideas dates back to Socrates and later Plato in his "Dialogues," in which we find the very seeds of critical thought and its political manifestation in the form of democracy.

More importantly, the very democratic process depends on such free airing of unpopular ideas.  Democracy demands that we maintain openness and a responsibility to actively engage in dialogue with those with whom we disagree.  

Nowhere in any of this is the notion of having to like the other's point of view.  On the contrary, we can dislike and even abhor another's point of view, but if we are democratic, we must respect the other's right to have and express his or her opinion.  

I applaud the university's efforts in providing a forum in which teachers, students and the public at large was invited to express their views.  Many felt enriched by contact with members of the Cuban community through the discussion of the historical/social ties that exist between Africa and Cuba.  

To not allow people to come to campus because of their views is simply implying that the citizenry is not to be trusted in making up their own minds. 

Some reasoned that Victor Dreke Cruz was guilty of human rights violations and that this was sufficient reason to deny him access to a university forum.  If this is so, then why were CIA recruiters allowed on campus earlier this semester?  Who else has been responsible for so much slaughter of innocents in the hemisphere?  In spite of their record of human rights violations, no one protested their presence on campus. 

On another note, the misquote, " I think you are the only FIU student here" should read "I think you are the only student of mine here."

Boyce Davis: Afro-Cuban event 'not out of control'

To the editor:



The article titled "Communist Controversy," which appeared in your paper on Nov. 19, contains a number of inaccuracies.  I would like to offer the [African-New World Studies] program's perspective because we were one of the members of the coalition organized to facilitate the event.

First, the event "Africa and Cuba 1959 to Present" was not "out-of-control." It was a well-organized forum intending to pursue issues of African-Cuban relations.  The format for the event was followed completely, interrupted only by well-orchestrated disruptions.  Disrupters were asked to leave and did so without resistance. However, the disruptions caused us to run out of time for the questions we wanted to ask our speakers.

Secondly, security for the event was not provided by Andres Gomez as stated in the photo's caption, but by FIU police.  Miami-Dade police also attended the event and had it under control at all times. FIU police, under the leadership of Chief Jesse Campbell, who personally managed the event's security, did an admirable job of providing security for the speakers and audience, maintaining order during an event in which disruptions threatened the event's integrity.

Thirdly, the African-New World Studies program was part of a campus-community coalition put together to further discussions of Afro-Cuban relations and manage the event.  The speakers were on a university tour across the country organized by John Hopkins University. FIU was one of the stops the tour that included Harvard University, University of Alabama, Spelman College and Brown University.  As FIU becomes a major university, academic freedom has to be ensured and fora cannot be threatened by intimidation from the community.  

There were numerous students in attendance, including those from our graduate program who were well represented in the audience.  Students from the University of South Florida, University of Miami and many of our own FIU students, as well as students from California also attended.  Three student organizations sponsored the event and the Biscayne Bay Student Government Council president addressed the audience.

My opening remarks for the event explained why it fell within the range of interests of our program. The importance of our speakers to African Diaspora Studies - which explores the international dimensions of the black experience - is three-fold. Decolonization in Africa and the Caribbean is a central topic in African Diaspora Studies and Pan Africanism. Cuba has symbolic significance in Latin America and Africa and has set a path for itself outside the orbit of U.S. economic and political control. Authors Walter Dreke, Eric Wiliams and others have provided some of the documentation for understanding these developments.

The Afro-Cuban experience - both in Cuba and in the diaspora - is a source of interest to many of our students, as well as to scholars of African Diaspora Studies, Latin American and Caribbean Studies.

The Beacon neglects to cover SPC sponsored events

To the editor:



Once again, The Beacon has appalled me.  Tuesday morning The Beacon arrived, but with the same old story.  No coverage of Biscayne Bay campus events, at least not the ones that really matter or praise the wonderful things that are being done at BBC.  

On Nov. 7, the fourth annual Latin Rock Explosion concert exceeded expectations. Student Programming Council and Hispanic Heritage Committee's hard work paid off.  With almost 600 tickets sold, state-of-the-art sound and light equipment, outside media coverage, reputable sponsors and an array of Latin pop/rock stars, you'd think somebody would want to cover it.  

Somebody did.  El Nuevo Herald made a lovely mention of the concert.  Venezuela al Dia (Venezuelan newspaper in Miami) and Colusa (Colombian newspaper based in Miami) both did stories before and after Latin Rock.  Trasnocho.com and Purorock.com featured the event on their websites.  Even Radiate 88 announced it. Yet, our very own school newspaper did not even mention the event. Why is it easier to obtain outside media coverage than coverage by our own newspaper?

Countless press releases, e-mails, and phone calls about the concert were given to The Beacon.  SPC practically begged them for coverage.  Tricia Baldeosingh, graduate assistant to Campus Life was nice enough to write an article for the issue before the concert.  The Beacon turned it down, saying it was a conflict of interest because Tricia was involved in the event.  After much insistence, they finally sent a reporter to cover the concert.  She was given a media pass and spent all night at the concert.  So there is no excuse for an article not to be published. I have not mentioned the reporter's name because I don't think it was her fault.  She wrote the article, but the reason why it was not published is unknown. 

This is not something new.  SPC has had a myriad of other  concerts, that The Beacon has ignored. Fulanito, Latin Grammy and Latin Billboard nominees and winners of Premio Lo Nuestro, performed here at BBC in 2000.  Baby Cham, a reggae artist, performed here the same year.  In 2001, winners of two Latin Billboard awards, Proyecto Uno lit up the stage with their energy infused performance.  This April, the Beenie Man concert was sold out. For Homecoming, SPC booked Flowetry, Pitbull and Tanto Metro & Devonte.  Although Homecoming was well covered, the concert didn't get adequate exposure.  

The only concert that The Beacon has mentioned is Run-DMC, pioneers in rap and hip-hop, who performed in 1999.

So why are we being ignored?  It's not only concerts they've overlooked. Numerous lecture series, comedy shows and smaller scale programming that goes on almost weekly are left uncovered.  This is disturbing to the students who help make these events possible. Don't they and BBC deserve recognition?  I always thought The Beacon was the university's newspaper, not University Park's newspaper.

Headline: In Our View: Government should protect Miranda rights
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In an upcoming Supreme Court case, the U.S. government, through the Department of Justice, is questioning the validity of the Miranda rights, including the Miranda warning that police must give suspects at the time of arrest: "you have the right to remain silent." 

The argument is that the Fifth Amendment, which protects suspects from self-incrimination, only matters in a criminal court case. Without that right, suspects may be coerced and forced to answer questions during detention and interrogation.

The United States wants a way out of having to deal with the rights of citizens when they hunt down "terrorists" in our midst. It's yet another attempt by the Bush administration to take away citizen's rights for the "greater good" of domestic safety. 

There's a fine line between intimidation and harassment. Turning the police and government into bullies may help find the "bad guys," but it will also make life a lot harder for the "good guys."

If the Supreme Court agrees with the DOJ, it will be a step backwards for liberty.

Headline: Grandfather's age, terminal disease force editor to confront death
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
One of my earliest memories is of walking with my grandfather, hand in hand, to Flagler to leave letters in the mailbox down the street. My grandmother would watch after us from the porch until we turned the corner.

He had then already begun to lose his vision, the garden he had kept in the backyard of that house growing wild, the weeds slowly strangling the tomatoes. Even in those early memories, even at that early age, I knew that my grandfather was sick. I had seen the needles used to administer the insulin. 

I knew then that he was walking me to the mailbox as much as I was walking him. I was always conscious of my grandfather's diabetes.

My grandfather only held my hand until we were out of sight of my grandmother, and then he'd let go, straightening himself. He didn't need the help. He didn't need my hand. I didn't need to be reminded that I was to stay by his side.

He was a proud man raised in a barracks in Cuba, son of a military family, forced out of that island when Fidel Castro seized control. Much of his history exists to me only as yellowed black and white photographs in an album high on a shelf in a closet.

But the result of his upbringing was apparent in the old man. He always held himself straight, and limited his displays of affection to hand waves and occasional smiles. He spoke sternly, but rarely. He took his meals like clockwork. He read constantly, stacks of newspapers and National Geographic magazines lying next to his rocking chair, fold-out maps of the Congo hanging out, a magnifying glass on top.

Some years ago, I can remember sitting at a dining room table on Christmas Eve, playing dominoes with my grandfather's older brother. Even my best game couldn't overcome the innate ability of an elder Cuban male, and he beat me soundly over and over again, while simultaneously arguing with my grandfather about dates and names from a Cuban history alien to me. My grandfather didn't play with us. He only played ajedrez, chess. That was the last Christmas I can remember with my grandfather as I knew him then.

Over the years since, diabetes has slowly chopped him away, robbing his vision, and his circulation. The latter cost him both of his legs. His mind hasn't faired much better than his body. A series of minor strokes resulted in a condition much like advanced Alzheimer's disease. 

Last Christmas, I visited him. I escaped from the din of celebration in the living room and walked into the bedroom where he lay inclined on the hospital bed, the sheets flattening abruptly, shortly after the waist, where legs should have been. 

He stared at me, no spark of recognition in his eyes, no words on his lips, a National Geographic on his lap, the maps folded in, the cover yet to be opened, the magnifying glass held loosely, uselessly in his hand. 

I thought about the grandfather I once knew, standing straight and proud, too proud, even, to hold my hand. In those days, he seemed a stronger man than I am now. In those days, he had been the pillar of my family, begrudged perhaps by some - having always been too critical and too demanding - but entrenched nonetheless.

None of that man was left now. Though physically he was missing only his legs, nothing was left of what was my grandfather: not his memories, his wisdom, his intellect or his strength. 

"Hello Grandfather." He lay there eyeing me suspiciously. Unfamiliar with his surroundings, he regarded everything and everyone suspect. I said nothing more.

This wasn't my grandfather. Not as I knew him. His was the face of Disease. His was the face of Age. The only thing I could think to say, I kept to myself. I thought, "Grandfather, I'd rather die than live like that."

Headline: University disregards students with children
Author: Sara Henderson
&nbsp;
I believed that an institution of higher learning is one of the few arenas where individuals are rewarded when  they exceed expectations.  It is disheartening to me that bureaucracy and red tape inhibit that.

My problem with red tape started several weeks ago.  In compliance with Florida law, all students must have specific immunizations before they can register. There are two exceptions - medical and religious. As a mother who is breastfeeding, a letter from my OB constitutes a medical waiver.  

Despite the fact that I am still breastfeeding, the letter on file was not sufficient for the Spring semester. 

When I visited the Health and Wellness Center, I discovered the doctors can diagnose illnesses and write prescriptions but not draft a letter verifying my choice not to receive a shot that could cause harm to my child. Why? Red tape.

 According to Caesar C. Ross III , assistant director for the Health and Wellness Center, the center's decision not to draft the letter is a practice, not a written policy. A practice  he would make no exception to.

Breastfeeding is not a condition or an ailment. It isn't something you "get." It is  a choice. Not my doctor's. Not the state of Florida's. Not Caesar Ross'. My choice.  

Because I have a child, I am unable to live on campus. This university doesn't offer family housing. This isn't a problem isolated to single parents. Two graduate students with a child are not afforded the opportunity to live on campus either. 

I question whether this is a Federal Fair Housing violation, considering familial status is a protected class under the Federal Fair Housing Act. 

Two weeks ago, I was informed that I could no longer have my child in the newsroom because of the risk that I might sue the university if something were to happen to her on campus. A section of the university employee handbook was cited, a section that makes no mention of liability. 

The fact is that I'm not going to sue anybody. 

I proposed signing a waiver that releases the university from responsibility except in the instance that a university employee, acting on behalf of the university, was to cause deliberate harm to my child. The response I received was that a waiver isn't worth the paper it is printed on. 

It is important to examine the basis for any policy. Usually such policies exist because of customer interface. As an editor, I write and I edit, two functions that do not require customer interface. The presence of my child does not impede my ability to work.

 I also question the wording. The policy cites the workplace. As a writer, my "workplace" is the entire campus. Does that mean if I intend go to campus, I can't bring her because part of the time the campus is my "workplace"? Also, the policy reads "as a general rule," implying that the rule does not apply in every single case. 

This problem is further complicated by the university serving the needs of some parents but not all. If my daughter was two-years-old or potty-trained, then I could leave her at the Children's Learning Center on campus, where a federal childcare subsidy that covers most of the cost is available. Because she wears diapers, I can't do that.

A university must consider the needs of all its students.  By creating unnecessary barriers for students, they are only proliferating the problem.

 The university is proliferating the problem   It is hard enough holding a job, attending school full-time and taking care of a child.  Parents do not need anymore barriers in their way, especially not those that prevent them from attaining a higher education. Face it: working at McDonald's isn't enough to support even one person.  A college degree is key to a well-paying job.   

I could not exceed anyone's expectations any further.  I am a single parent and an Honors College student who owns a small consulting firm, takes a 16 credit course load and serves on The Beacon's editorial board. I seek no recognition or congratulations. Rather, I ask that my abilities be my only limiting factor.

Headline: Men's soccer eliminated in second round of NCAA's
Author: Daisy Fernández/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team surpassed their success last year, as they moved to the second round of the NCAA tournament on Friday night. Supported by a spirited crowd of 574, FIU defeated the Golden Knights of UCF for the second time, 2-1. Juan Rivera's early goal in the second half secured another post-season match for the Golden Panthers.

FIU 2, UCF 1

In the first half, both FIU players and spectators felt tension on the field. 
Junior defender Brian Malec paved the way for the Golden Knights with his goal in the 33rd minute. He was assisted by sophomore midfielder Jaime Panellas. 

From a distance, Panellas kicked the ball to Malec, who was in a close range to the box.    

"I thought we were nervous, and we didn't play as well as we could have early on," said head coach Karl Kremser. "We were never able to get in an offensive rhythm in the first half, and that's a credit to Central Florida. It was a war out there."

The Golden Panthers tied the game with junior midfielder Billy Boswell's goal. His crowd-pleasing goal was delivered with the help of Adam Wilson. Off a header by Wilson, Boswell gracefully executed a bicycle-kick from inside the box.  

Senior midfielder Juan Rivera placed the team in the lead at the 51st minute. 

Sophomore forward Oscar Gil passed the ball to Rivera, who made a successful shot to the top left corner of the net.

After taking the lead 2-1, FIU made keen defensive moves that guaranteed them a victory.  

UCF finishes its season at 10-8-3, while the Golden Panthers move on to the second round of the NCAA.


SMU 3, FIU 1

The Golden Panthers were defeated by SMU in the second round of the NCAA Men's soccer championship tournament. Their 3-1 loss ended their hopeful season at 13-6-1. 

The Mustangs raided the first half with two unanswered goals. The first was made three minutes into the first half. SMU's Kevin Hudson scored first on assists by Colin Clark and J.D. Johnston. Clark passed the ball to Johnston, who in turn kicked it to Hudson. Hudson made a successful shot past keeper Shawn Crowe, raising the score 1- 0.

The Mustangs netted another in the 42nd minute, as Duke Hashimoto scuffled past the FIU defense and slipped the ball through.

The Panthers got on attempt the scoreboard in the second half. 

At the 53rd minute, Billy Boswell made FIU's only goal off a pass by John Pulido.

Hashimoto sealed the game for SMU in the 72nd minute. Crowe blocked two shots before Hashimoto made his second goal of the night.

The contest was played in Dallas, Texas with temperatures in the 30s.
"I don't think the weather had that much of an effect," coach Kremser said. 

"In the second half, we moved the ball and showed what we could do."
SMU, who had a roster with several players from South Florida, boosts its record to 16-2-3. SMU now moves on to the third round of the NCAA tournament to face Boston College.

Headline: Women look to build on past success, another Sun Belt Conference title
Subheadline: Russo: This is not going to be a rebuilding year
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Despite losing three players to graduation from last year's team which reached the round of 32 in the NCAA tournament, expectations are high in University Park once again. Among the losses the team suffered following their 27-6 campaign a year ago was losing their two leading scorers and rebounders, Gergana Slavtcheva (16.6 ppg, 7.6 rpg) and Cheryl Moody (15.0ppg, 11.5 rpg). The Lady Golden Panthers also boast such accolades as the Sun Belt Conference Preseason Player of the Year in Cormisha Cotton (13.7 ppg, 7.6 rpg), who is joined on the conference's preseason All-American team by senior guard/forward Mandy Shafer (10.4 ppg). 

All the individual recognition will be accompanied by the expectations to repeat as Sun Belt Conference champions after being picked first in the conference's East Division by its coaches. Head Coach Cindy Russo, who has met with only two losing seasons in her 23 years at FIU and collected her 500th victory last season, welcomes the preseason awards and expectations with open arms. "It's better than not having the recognition."

"I've told people that this is not going to be a rebuilding year," coach Russo added. "We have some people that we think are ready to step up and fill in." 

Coach Russo will look to Cotton, who is already a member of FIU's 1,000-point club, as well as Shafer who shot 36 percent from beyond the arc last year, to be the two main leaders on her team. "Even though, we're going to run a little more this year than we did last season," Shafer said, "I think we can still be successful and I'm hoping to get back to at least where we got last year if not further." 

Cotton, who transferred from Georgia after being redshirted her freshman year, is hoping for a sweet sixteen appearance after suffering a heart breaking loss to Penn State last year in Happy Valley, PA. during the NCAA tournament. 

"I'm hoping to improve on my rebounds by getting into double digits in the category," Cotton, who is the mother of a four-year-old Richantia Dunbar, said. "I think I've worked very hard and I feel I can carry this team." 

Also expected to play a key role in the Golden Panthers' run to repeat as Sun Belt champs will be senior guard Anita Heller, who has played both guard positions while at FIU. The Hungarian native has averaged 47 percent from the field in her career for the Golden Panthers. 
Back from season ending ACL surgery a year ago, junior point guard Ivelina Vrancheva will also be called upon to perform after guard Deniz Boz went down for the year after tearing her ACL this summer. 

It appears as if it will be point guard by committee for coach Russo's  team as Miami transfer Kenitra Newman and a few newcomers will see some quality minutes as well. 

Silvia Mesa, a 6-8 center from Valencia, Spain, will be a threat down low alongside Cotton if she can stay healthy after encountering knee problems in the past. 

Russo plans on starting the senior should she stay healthy throughout the year.

While the expectations are not farfetched, the road will not be an easy one. 

The Golden Panthers will see cross-town rival Miami come to Golden Panther Arena as well as Duke, a final four team a year ago, and UNC-Greensboro on the road.

FIU begins the defense of its conference title play in January.

Headline: Men's team hopes to improve, compete for SBC title
Author: Daisy Fernández/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With several new players on the court, the men's basketball team hopes to reach higher ground this year. The team is glad to introduce a number of newcomers: Al Harris, Junior Matias, Eulis Baez, and Belco Bamba. These diverse players may have what it takes to push the team further than has gone before. 

In the 2001-2002 season, the Golden Panthers posted a 10-20 overall, 4-10 Sun Belt Conference. Their biggest let down was the absence of junior forward Al Harris, who at 6-9 210 lbs would have added power to their game. Since he did not play, the team suffered a great deal. The team was ultimately defeated in the first round of the Sun Belt Conference championship by North Texas, a team that still poses a threat today.

"Last year was a struggle for us. We were a very young and inexperienced team. We had problems closing games, but I feel we have gained from that experience," said head coach Donnie Marsh. 

The team aims to rise above all of last year's hardship. During pre-season they were seeded third in their division by the coaches in the Sun Belt. And with such a positive start, they plan to go much further this season. The Golden Panthers hope to surpass last year's disappointing record.

"I feel that when we have our team together, we can be in a position to challenge the best teams in the league. We are much deeper, stronger, more physical and more mature than last year," Marsh said.
So far, the FIU team has encountered a few difficulties. Four players have had off-season knee surgery and five have not played yet. 
The efforts of certain key players may actually bring men's basketball a brighter season. Many are returning from last year like Rodrigo Viegas. 

This 6-6 senior forward is the captain and the team's second leading scorer and rebounder. Due to injuries to his ACL and meniscus, he will not be playing until late December. The team awaits his return, because he is essential for their success. Their leading scorer and rebounder, Taurance Johnson, has been suspended at Marsh's discretion. 

Nonetheless, The contributions of this 6-9 230 lb. sophomore forward have earned him an honorable mention in the all Sun Belt Conference. 
Sophomore guard Carlos Morban is another returnee to watch for. He broke FIU's single season record for steals and ranked sixth in the nation in steals. It's no wonder he is a key player on the court, while averaging 10 points a game. 

Al Harris, the powerful junior forward who was well sought-after last year, is now eligible to play and is off to a good start.

The new players for FIU are just as promising as the veterans. Junior Matias and Eulis Baez are both from the Dominican Republic and both played for Southeastern (IA) Community College. They were both on the Dominican National team and each averaged over 10 points a game. Belco Bamba transferred late from Cincinnati State Community College, but is originally from West Africa. This center/forward's impressive physicality (he is 6'9 245lbs.) may be just what the team needs. 

The Golden Panthers' will face a myriad of tough conference opponents such as Western Kentucky, Louisiana Lafayette, Arkansas Little Rock, and North Texas.

The team is expecting a big improvement from the 2001-02 season mainly due to new size in the paint and one more year of maturity.

FIU opens up its conference schedule in January.

LSU was able to stave off several runs by FIU en route to winning the Thanksgiving Tournament. 

"Mentally, I think its good because we know we can play with that team," FIU coach Cindy Russo said. "Fatigue played a factor down the stretch."

LSU, ranked third nationally by both the Associated Press and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' poll, got off to a fast start as they forced  five FIU turnovers in the games first four minutes.

Headline: Inaugural season successful but questions remain unanswered
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The inaugural season for FIU football is officially over. The novice team coached by former Miami Dolphin backup quarterback Don Strock concluded the year with a 5-6 record. Each of its victories came against five of the six non-scholarship programs appearing on their schedule. 

The year should be looked back upon as one that changed the athletic scene at the school forever. Prior to the 2002 season, FIU was the largest university in the United States that did not field a football team. 
More than three years have passsed since the now defunct Board of Regents approved the programs installation. Many in the community and within the university publicly questioned the aggressive push for the sport.      
How could FIU, a commuter school who has an average age of 25 years for its students, field a football team when it did not have the support? 

If the first season is any indication of things to come, the program should continue to improve. In the end, most questions on the field were answered, but some remain without response.

Was the inaugural season a success? 

Yes. The Golden Panthers concluded the year 5-6, posting a 5-2 record on the home Community Stadium turf. 

If you compare that record to recent upstarts, FIU did well. Rival Florida Atlantic, a program FIU looks to for comparison, concluded the 2001 season 4-6.

Can FIU compete at the Division I-AA level?

Yes. FIU can be competitive at this level with the majority of the pack. The Golden Panthers have yet, as should be expected, to provide a challenge versus a ranked opponent. 

When will FIU be able to beat the better teams?

That will only come with time and experience. FIU is a young team with just eight players on their roster being a junior or senior. 

Those are three questions that have relatively easy responses. But what about the tougher ones?

In South Florida, sports fans are used to having winning football teams with the Miami Dolphins and the University of Miami Hurricanes. How long before we can expect FIU to have a playoff run?
 
Like any program just starting out, it will take time. FIU did well in its first year. They beat the teams they were supposed to and lost to the ones that they were overmatched against. I would say to give them two more years before you can expect the Golden Panthers to make a run at the Division I-AA playoffs. 

Everyone wants to see FIU make the jump to Division I-A. Is it feasible and if so, when?

Don't hold your breath. Division I-A ball is a whole different game. It's a faster paced, rougher and more demanding level with superstars on both sides of the ball. 

Simply stated, at that level, every game you suit up for you will be facing the best former high school football players in the country. 

That isn't always the case in FIU's current division. The Golden Panthers aren't good enough yet. Again, they are just 11-games old. 
The attendance is another issue. 

Although the athletic department is quick to point out that average attendance at the games totaled around 10,000, that number is grossly inflated due to the turnout for the inaugural contest against St. Peter's on Aug. 29 which drew 17,314 fans. The more correct number should be around 5,000. In order for the attendance to increase, the team has to win and needs to be promoted more throughout the South Florida community. 

The addition of football to FIU brought about plenty of national media attention which included an article in the New York Times about Coach Strock and the program. Two home contests were televised on statewide television (which was also available on satellite). 

The previous attendance high for any FIU athletic event was just under 5,000 when the men's basketball team defeated the University of Michigan Wolverines at Golden Panther Arena in 1998. 

Additionally, the university took its first step in creating a tighter bond with its alumni. The homecoming contest versus Gardner-Webb brought back hundreds of former students to the University Park campus. 
Although Athletics Director Rick Mello and Strock deserve much credit for their dedication to making FIU a strong program, they are far from reaching their goal. For football to survive at this university, more interest is needed from the student body. A university with 34,000 enrolled students and 86,000 alumni living in South Florida alone should be able to attract more out to home games. 

The team needs to be marketed more. More marketing brings more recruits. More recruits make better players which, in turn, make your program a success. 

At this moment, football at FIU is still a big question mark. 

Will it attract the attention and support it needs? 

Will it be able to compete at the high level it must to defeat better, scholarship programs? 

Will FIU be able to lure top available high school talent to the team with schools such as South Florida and rival Florida Atlantic improving and also vying for similar players coming out of South Florida? 

Answers to these questions are needed for a more accurate picture of the program's future. Only time will tell.

Hello.  My name is Lissette Asencio and I attempted to write to you, before, in reference to writing for The Beacon.  Yet, my email may have possibly not been delivered to your email address.  Therefore, if you have not received it, I ask you, if it is not too much of a bother, if there is some way that you could direct me to the person I could speak to, regarding writing for The Beacon. I attend both campuses.  Therefore, either campus would not be a problem.  Also, I work for Miami-Dade County Communications Department, so sometimes getting out of work to attend meetings and such may be a problem.  Yet, I had heard that for the Opinions section, you did not have to attend weekly meetings and so forth and so on.  Therefore, this interested me greatly, and I was hoping to get a chance to write for Opinions.  I apologize if this is not a matter to confront you, personally, about.  Yet, I previously worked under Bia, who handled the North Campus a while back.  I also wrote for Opinions as a freshman. I am now a junior, print journalism major at FIU, and extremely interested in writing for this paper.  Please feel free to contact me at 786-346-2348.  My email address is Lissy@miamidade.gov.

Headline: Either Lott Goes or I leave the Republican Party
Subheadline:  
Author: thedrdrew@netzero.com
&nbsp;
There was another time where I almost threw in the towel on my Republican party---the impeachment trials--when several Republican Senators failed to do their constitutional duties and protect the American people from an abusive executive in the Oval office (I don't mean Hillary). On the pending issue, the Republican party has to do its duty to elect responsible, capable leaders to get out the message about the party. The liberals have taken some cheap shots in the past calling Republicans insensitive on so-called "minority" issues and have even stooped as low to call them "racist" or "bigots." Of course the real reason liberals say this is because of their lack of intelligence and their inability to understand the Conservative position. That's what ignorant people do when they don't understand something: they resort to name-calling and they misrepresent an idea. On the idea of race, the Republican party has been trying for years to sell to the American people that our agenda applies to all and singles no groups of people out. Liberals have been successful for years by demogoguing the issue of race--showing they "care" for "minorities" by creating programs that make them dependent on the federal government forever.

The Democrats have been successful in the area of race by singling out groups of people: the poor, Americans of African descent, Jews, etc. What they have done is counterproductive to the issue of equality by grouping people as "dependent victims" on one side of the partition and "priveleged victimizers" on the other side of the partition. The Democrats are the creators of class warfare, the politics of personal destruction, and pessimism politics. What separates the Republican party from the Democratic party in the issue of "minorities" is that they our issues apply to no single group--but to all Americans. An example of this is education. By getting rid of Affirmative action and having an accountability system all recipients of education will realize their dreams based on their individual efforts and performance. 

On to Senate Minority leader Trent Lott. First of all, he has never been a good leader for the Republican party. He is uncharismatic, lacks vision, and only cares about power. Leaders have to watch what they say. There is no excuse for saying that things would have been better if a segregationist became President. This is no slip of the tongue. He made this statement before and therefore one could make no mistake about what is meant by this statement. He claims he was just praising the century old Senator for his service to the nation. This is no excuse for an ignorant statement. He can make as many appologies as he wishes but it won't change what he said. I am calling on Trent Lott to resign not only from the leadership position but also from the Senate--knowing fully well it will tip the balance of power. Morality is more imporant than politics and I would rather show to the American people that the Republican party is more interested in morality than politics.

It is ridiculous that a university refuses to help its own students.  When i tried to register this semester, i was told i had a general hold.  Thinking it was an overdue library book, i went to the Cashier's office and gave them $10.  The lady smiled and she told me  that i owe $267.59. I found out that my Student Loan had been cancelled when my Florida Merit's scholarship was reinstated, but no one had bothered to give me a notice. The lady who "helped" me said "you still have to pay or you can't register".   
I guess i must be one of those lucky college students who earns thousands of dollars a month, and can pay any amount of money on demand. I wouldn't be mad if they had at least had the "courtesy" to tell me that i had to pay such and such amount because of the cancellation of my Loan. By the time i got the money, the classes that i needed were closed and no one at the school seemed to give a damn................ Another happy student

Headline: Pi Kappa Phi auction benefits PushAmerica auction
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Pi Kappa Phi held its first annual gentlemen's charity auction for a crowd of about 200 female FIU students on Nov. 19 in the Graham Center ballrooms. 

"It was a nice, classy event that highlighted [the auctionees'] talents and showed who we as a fraternity are and what we're about," said Brian Swenson, a member of the fraternity, local PushAmerica chairman and main organizer of the event. 

All proceeds will be forwarded to PushAmerica, a national organization founded by the national Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and dedicated to helping those with disabilities, children and adults alike. 

"We mainly focus on mental and physical disabilities such as mental retardation, Down's Syndrome and cerebral palsy," Pi Kappa Phi president and auctionee Clayton Solomon said.

Doors for the event opened at 8 p.m. and the hosts, Carlos Moreno and Gina Grandchamp, came on stage just after 9 p.m. 

Moreno is a member of Pi Kappa Phi. Grandchamp is president of the Phi Sigma Sigma sorority.

Tickets for the event sold for $5 in advance and $7 at the door. 

"We raised $2,500 which will go to our philanthropy so all-in-all it was a huge success," Moreno said. 

The $2,500 he mentions include ticket sales and the bids for dates. 

After an introductory dialogue performed by the hosts in which Moreno quipped that the reason why he chose not to be auctioned tonight was because he didn't want to ruin the egos of the rest of the participants, the auction began.

One by one, the 15 participants walked out onto the stage and took a walk up and down the catwalk.

Next, many of them answered a couple of questions posed by Grandchamp such as, "what qualities do you look for first in a woman," and "what is your idea of the perfect date." 

Others instead chose to entertain the audience witth performances of their own. 

Contestants introduced video presentations highlighting the person's favorite hobbies, sang a song and sometimes danced. One contestant even chose to display his karate skills.  

Bidding began at $10 and steadily increased, many times surpassing the $100 mark. Women donated up to $140 and in return were promised a date with that contestant.

The Macaroni Grill offered complimentary entrees for one of the dates but all of the others had to pay their own way, Swenson said. 

In addition to helping a worthy cause and potentially getting a date for an upcoming weekend, sorority members had another motive to go. 

A sign-in sheet awaited sorority members at the back of the ballroom. The sorority with the most attendees won a trophy known as the Spirit Cup. This year that honor went to Phi Sigma Sigma.

Members of the crowd in attendance had their various reasons for attending. 

"I went to support a good cause," said Aubrey Jones, junior, health sciences major.

"I went because I heard that the guys were going to perform their talents so even if I didn't bid on them, I got to see the guys' talents and how much girls bid on them," said Kelly Leano, freshman biochemistry.

"I have some friends in the fraternity and I'm just here to support them," said Lisa Milnamow, junior, international relations. 

Overall, the crowd of women who showed up were very supportive.

"It was really good and classy. It raised a lot of money for Push America," said Giselle Diaz, senior, nursing. 

"The crowd was great. I couldn't have asked for a better crowd," Swenson said.

Headline: BBC to open Veggie stand
Subheadline: Jewish students lobby for BBC kosher restaurant
Author: Cari Cohen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students at the Biscayne Bay Campus will receive a greater variety of foods when a vegetarian stand opens next semester. But not everyone is happy about it.

At the beginning of the semester, sophomore Adam Aronson and Jennifer Hazan, an undergraduate representative at student government, set out to change the types of food served at BBC in an effort. But the two have had different ideas on how this should be approached. Hazan has been working to open a vegetarian stand next to the Oasis at Academic One, whereas Aronson wants a kosher restaurant. 

Hazan said the issue of a vegetarian restaurant was brought to her attention at a Student Government Council meeting. She has been working on it with SGC and Food Services Director Arthur Sternberg. 

"We have committed and we will open some type of vegetarian service next semester," Sternberg said.

Many students said they like the idea mostly because of the health benefits.

 "They don't have any vegetarian restaurants in here and I think we should because it's healthier than most of the other food offered," Shannon Metayer, junior, said.

Jacqueline Tornes, senior, agreed. "A fresh approach to food...would be a great addition to our cafeteria," she said.

Meanwhile, Aronson and SGC Undergraduate Representative Mica Mintz have been campaigning to open up a kosher restaurant for a number of reasons, religion being the main one, they said.

"Most Jews will not eat at a vegetarian restaurant that is not kosher," Aronson, who is an Orthodox Jew, said.

In the Torah, the Jewish Holy Book, Orthodox Jews are not permitted to eat any food not deemed kosher. A kosher restaurant would not just benefit Jews, but "...Muslims who cannot get Halal [will] accept it because they do not eat pork and a kosher restaurant cannot have pork," Aronson said.

"There are guidelines [for kosher food]. We are in the research phase right now," Kristia Green, business service coordinator, said. "If we end up going that route, then we have to make sure we're in compliance with kosher rules." 

These guidelines make it harder for some students to find meals on campus.

"I have nothing to eat while I'm at school," Iddo Gutman, freshman and Orthodox Jew, said. Even if a vegetarian bar were to contain kosher food, with the exception of the cheese,  Gurman said she will not eat it.

Hazan said these factors make it harder, more costly and timely for a kosher restaurant to become a reality.

She said that roughly 10 percent of the 7,885 students who attend classes at the BBC keep kosher, and she is one of them. But she said it is more realistic to have a vegetarian restaurant at this time. 

Sternberg also said kosher food is very expensive and "at this present facility, it would be impossible."

"The kosher issue is important to me because I keep kosher. [But] things take time," Hazan said. "My goal is to take the vegetarian stand over, then approach the kosher issue."

She said the plan is to start off with a vegetarian stand that can slowly be adapted to offer kosher food.

But Aronson said this will not do.

"If you have a vegetarian restaurant and try to convert it to a kosher restaurant, you'd have to get rid of the utensils and even the ovens," Aronson said. "A lot of minor changes that would lead to a lot of expense."

 "If we're going to do something kosher, we ought to do it right," Mintz said.

Whether kosher or vegetarian, many students like the idea of a different food selection altogether.

The food itself is not the only issue at hand. FIU currently contracts all its food services through Aramark. In order for a kosher restaurant to be established, Aramark would have to either serve kosher food or bring in an outside contractor.

The SGC at University Park Campus is undergoing a similar situation in order to address the situation.

Besides the food selection changing at both campuses, the entire cafeteria will be under renovation over the next few semesters at BBC, and plans have already been made to change the layout of the Oasis. 

Hazan thinks that UP might open a kosher restaurant before BBC does. 

"Things seem to happen easier there," she said.

Headline: Survey: parking No. 1 student concern
Author: Christina Kent / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Ever gone mad because your class was about to start and you couldn't find a parking spot? Or felt your heart jump into your throat when you see the total of your textbook purchase at the campus bookstore? A recent survey shows you're not alone.

As a part of student government's Reach Out program on Campaign Days, students walking through the Graham Center were asked to fill out a survey regarding possible "issues of importance" students have about the university and the presence of student government on campus. 

 Four of the top five gripes pointed by the survey were money-related. Parking came first with 66 percent of the students surveyed checking it.

To some students, parking is a dirty game, requiring desperate tactics.

 "This morning, I followed a guy to his car and as I approached his vehicle, a girl challenged me from the other end of the lot and decided to accelerate and try to beat me to the spot," Angie Falcon, freshman, public relations and law, complained of her parking woes. "So I sped up, got in front of her and took the spot first."

Melissa Alvarez, a clerk in the Parking and Traffic Department, says that students are accommodated with plenty of spaces.

"Parking is available, but people just want to park close," she said.

The department does try to alleviate some of the stress of parking by having Public Safety officials available outside of GC ready to drive people by golf cart to their cars, Alvarez said. In addition, three new parking garages are going up around campus, with plans to start building in early spring.

Trailing close behind parking, with 62 percent of survey-takers' disapproval, was FIU Bookstore prices.

Adam Johnson, junior, business administration, transferred from UCF last year, where he said the book prices were considerably cheaper. Oftentimes, he goes to the FIU Bookstore's primary competitor, BookSmart, across the street from University Park.

"My microbiology book last spring was $109 here, and it was $20 cheaper across the street," Johnson said.

BookSmart clerk Gabriel Mena said that for "buy-back," the FIU Bookstore will give you about half of the used value, while BookSmart will give you about half of the new value. 

The FIU Bookstore, which is operated by Barnes & Noble, says it thrives on that kind of "friendly competition."

"When we have competition, that's a good thing for the students," David Sanborn, assistant general manager of the FIU Bookstore, said. "It makes us keep our pricing competitive."

Sanborn said that in order to clear up the common misconception that the bookstore is purposefully overpricing, it is important for students to educate themselves about textbook revenues. Nine percent goes back to the university to help fund academic programs and activities, the same amount that is received by the author. Sixty-seven percent is turned over to the book publisher. The breakdown of a dollar spent at the campus bookstore can be found under the "Student Center" tab at the FIU Bookstore's web site, http://fiu.bkstore.com/.

Sanborn also encouraged students to apply for a job at the FIU Bookstore - employees get a 20 percent discount on books.

Following bookstore prices as a concern on the survey was tuition, student fees and food court prices.

SGA Student Services Representative Alejandra Cordovez said she was concerned that survey participants selected Student Services as seventh out of the 13 issues.

"Right now, I'm interested in specifying exactly what part of student services people are dissatisfied with," Cordovez explained.

She said her committee is designing a follow-up survey that will help them target the areas of concern.

Overall, on a scale of "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree," approximately 50 percent  "agree" that SGA members are approachable, have a strong presence on campus, and keep the students' best interest in mind. Only four percent of the 535 students surveyed "strongly disagreed" or had no comment on their satisfaction with SGA.

"I saw that SGA was content with where they were, but I wanted to see if the students felt that way," said David Medina, newly elected SGC Marketing Coordinator and writer of the survey.

Not only was it a way to get an assessment of how the students feel, he said, it was an opportunity for them to voice their opinions. But instead of letting students come to SGA, SGA went to them, Medina said.

Vicky Owles, SGA advisor, said that while she is not surprised about any of the top five, she is impressed with the number of people who were surveyed.

"Five hundred students answering any survey is a pretty successful number," she said.  

Owles said that SGA is "constantly concerned about how the students perceive them," and they want to make sure the students are enjoying their experience at FIU and feeling the presence of student government.

Meanwhile, Medina has been presenting the results of the survey at the weekly SGA meetings, in the hopes that members in their respective positions will take notice of some of the top issues and further his efforts to make a difference. He plans to distribute more surveys of this kind in thesSpring, perhaps elaborating on some of the things survey-takers wrote in the "additional comments" portion.

These included issues such as housing safety, the food court not accepting credit cards and motivation of student involvement on campus. For now, he hopes administrative officials take notice of students' opinions.

"The more pressure we can put on the administration, the more action can be done," Medina said. "We'd like to give them a little kick in the rear."

Headline: Journalism program re-accredited
Subheadline: Accrediting council points out school's strengths, weaknesses
Author: Alejandra Diaz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After spending a year preparing documents, organizing files and writing a report, the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications granted the School of Journalism and Mass Communications its second re-accreditation in the beginning of November.

Every six years SJMC is visited by an on-site evaluation team consisting of members from other universities nationwide that evaluate the program.  During this evaluation, the team tests the school on 12 standards that measure the creditability and effectiveness of the program and its components, SJMC Dean J. Arthur Heise said. 

The accreditation process requires two accrediting councils to review the findings and later move to make a final decision. 

At the end of the on-site evaluation, the team writes an evaluation report, which is then handed to the school; it includes a detailed analysis and findings report that is based on the 12 standards.  These standards include criteria such as administration, budget, curriculum, teaching capabilities and facilities. FIU was found to be in compliance with the requirements of all 12 categories.  The report also includes a summary sheet that discusses the strengths and weaknesses the team found during their evaluation.  

According to the report, the school was credited with having a strong entrepreneurial leadership program, a strong writing program and strong commitment to enhancing student-writing skills. It also pointed out the diverse student population within the program and commended SJMC for having an innovative Spanish language master's program in journalism.

SJMC's faculty and staff reacted positively to the team's evaluation results.

 "It's just fantastic, I couldn't be happier with the results and so seems everyone else in the university," Heise said.  "It's gratifying to know that we have managed to be in compliance with all of the 12 standards for the third time in a row."

"I think it's great because it helps the students to come from an accredited program and the fact that we meet all the criteria says something," Advertising Assistant Professor Courtney Bosworth, said.

Students find the results to be a crucial step for the program's progress but feel there is still room for improvement.

"It is definitely an asset to our journalism program, but there are many improvements that need to be made," Ana Olivares, junior, public relations, said.

Others said they are happy that their degrees will be worth more. 

"I think it's great that we were re-accredited because it makes the school seem more prestigious and it's good to know that we are able to meet the standards of other universities even though we are a public university," Ingrid Vega, senior, public relations, said.

"There is nothing better than knowing we have an accredited program because when we go out in to the real world, we are more likely to get a good job," Carol Navarro, junior, television production, said.

Although SJMC is proud of the positives pointed out by the team, many feel their listing of weaknesses will prove to be an invaluable tool for the school.  

"The strengths and weaknesses are very helpful to me because it helps when explaining issues to the people up the line," Heise said.  

The first weakness mentioned in the report is the lack of resources to support the expanding number of students within the program.  

Space is limited and the school depends on other programs moving from the campus if they are to occupy more classrooms, Heise said. 

Others said the budget does not allow for expansions.

"I don't believe that we have received the financial support from the university, relative to our size, that other academic units within the university have," Bosworth, said. 

The fascilities are good but need to be expanded because of the rising number of incoming students, Assistant Dean Saul Sztam said.

"Since '97-'98, we have had an increase of about 60 percent in undergraduate students," he said. "That increase doesn't match up with the increase in staff, faculty, equipment and budget."

Many students also feel the funding is not appropriate.

 "I think this campus is a lot smaller and I think we definitely need more funding in the Biscayne Bay Campus," Ingrid Vega, senior, public relations, said. 

But other professors, like Donald Sneed, said FIU's journalism program actually better off than other universities' programs.

"I've taught at four other universities and the facilities at these top rate universities are not as good as SJMC's facilities," Sneed said.  "On the other hand, the facilities at schools for the most part are relative, I believe that we have fine facilities."

The report also mentions a shortage of space.

After the last accreditation six years ago, the school had plans for a new building. But this did not become a reality.

"To my knowledge, there are no plans in the near future for a new building because the university decided that the marine biology building should take precedence." Heise said. "The state allocates the money to pay for it, so it's up to them to decide but mostly it's a question of time and the proverbial dollar."

SJMC's curriculum, which concentrates on writing, was described in the report as too narrow because it excludes most aspects of visual communication, on-line journalism and publication design.

"I understand the concerns about the narrowness of our curriculum but I feel that we have made huge progress in terms of courses added to the curriculum," Heise said.  "I believe their biggest concern was that we do not yet have the appropriate facilities, so our curriculum is limited in that sense, but we are working on ways to address this issue."

Some students said the limited resources cause scheduling problems that have a negative effect on their personal lives.

"I've spent the past month or so out of work because the scheduling of classes is such a problem," Robert Yeequee, junior, television production, said.

 The school is waiting for the College of Health and Urban Affairs to vacate space in Academic Two; that could alleviate some of the need for more rooms Heise said.

 "We are considering using the room as a teaching newsroom," he said.

SJMC hopes to gain final confirmation of the re-accreditation early next year, but Heise said the administration is already working on ways to address the accreditation council's concerns as well as those of the students and faculty.

Heise also said he is confident.

"Since this program became accredited, we have been found to be in compliance with all 12 standards but it won't be official until next year.  So far there have been no dissenting reviews; no one has disagreed with their findings," Heise said.

Headline: Shape probes human relationships
Author: Claudia Ortega / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
"At least I'm educated, so I comprehend that I'm f***ed." With that, Adam, one of the characters of Neil LaBute's play "The Shape of Things," clarifies his problems with student loans and a college education. 

It also proves my point: This play is best enjoyed and understood by college students. I came to that conclusion as I was walking out of GableStage, awed by what I had just seen, and heard an elderly woman behind me - the average audience member was no younger than 35 years old - say that she found the play to be "a bit 'whory'." 

Granted, there is a sex scene and there is nudity, and maybe it wasn't exactly crucial to the plot that we see two characters humping, but it's hard to avoid gratuitous sex anywhere. Luckily, "The Shape of Things" owes its controversy and shock value to something a lot more satisfying than one gratuitous sex scene: a plot twist.  

Exploring issues of inhibitions, rebellion, loyalty (to others and to yourself), friendships and relationships through the lives of twenty-somethings in a liberal arts college, the play is more readily understood and related to by a younger crowd. 

Neil LaBute, playwright and filmmaker whose credits include the films "In the Company of Men" and "Friends and Neighbors," probes the ubiquitous question: "What is art?" in this play.  As tiresome and overdone as the topic may seem, LaBute infuses his play with witty, intelligent dialogue and handles the ultimate question with such an innovative and unexpected approach that your mouth will be unwillingly gaping by the time the play is over.

Of course, the effect of the play is augmented when you have a stellar ensemble working on the production. The set is comprised of different, vividly-colored, Mondrian-like panels which slide back and forth insinuating different settings and leaving room for personal interpretation. 

The sound is also well-done, using a slight echo in the scene in which we are transported to an auditorium. Directing the play is Joseph Adler, GableStage's artistic director. And last but not least, the talented cast adds humanity to their roles.

Claire Tyler, who received her BFA in drama from FIU, shines as Evelyn, a bold, adventurous, intellectual art grad student who questions conventions and stimulates controversy in everyone she meets. Evelyn is by far the most interesting character and Tyler knows when to effectively peel back and expose another layer of the complex character; for instance, she abandons her breathy Marilyn Monroe-like voice, which becomes a bit annoying at times, when she chooses to expose her real feelings.

Terrell Hardcastle, who co-starred with Tyler in the recent production of Comic Potential at Actors' Playhouse, plays the spineless, unassuming Adam who is just "fine being nothing" convincingly.  Hardcastle's skill makes Adam's metamorphosis seem entirely natural to Adam while making everyone else uneasy with it.

Laif Gilbertson and Autumn Horne, who play Adam's friends Phillip and Jenny, round out the cast and add another dimension to the play. 

Their relationship with each other and Adam is complex, and, as they become strained, we start to see Evelyn's disastrous effect on the people who cross her path. 

The ultimate message of the play is universal, but I think LaBute had a certain audience in mind, otherwise he would have picked a different cosmos to wrap around his theme. In fact, when I walked into the theater and heard Pearl Jam's Yield playing, I didn't understand what was going on; it didn't quite seem to fit in with the well-dressed, sophisticated audience.  

During scene changes, Smashing Pumpkins' Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness blasts over the house PA system (a device used by LaBute in his London premiere to keep people from discussing anything while the lights were off). 

I encourage everyone to go see this play.  Even if you dismiss the large, philosophical issue brought up, you will nevertheless be entertained. 

It moves along at a quick pace, never giving you time to check your watch, and its surprise is well worth the ticket price.

Headline: Tricky Business lacks originality
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
When "Big Trouble" came out, there was no question who the writer behind the goofy novel was: The Miami Herald's humor columnist Dave Barry. The book read like an extended passage from one of his columns. It was fast, funny, witty, sarcastic and never afraid to make fun of the weirdness that happens in our hometown of Miami.

Three years later, Barry finally released his second novel, "Tricky Business." At least, I think it's Barry's new novel. It says he wrote it on the cover. There's a big picture of him on the back. The story has elements that definitely seem like something that would come out of his mind. Dialogue reads like the strange conversations he loves so much. But with each passing page, the book seems less like Barry and more like...well, anybody.

The novel is about a motley crew of strange characters who all wind up on the same daily casino cruise ship during a particularly bad storm. The ship is also involved in drug smuggling, this particular night being no exception. We follow the various characters in their own little subplots until one big moment throws them all together, leaving them in  wacky action mode for the remainder of the novel. It's actually a lot more clever and impressive than it sounds.

With every element present - quirky characters, smart fast dialogue, situations that were just plain weird - why does "Tricky Business" feel more like any other novel? Why did I get to the end and say "Well, that was good, but Hiaasen could've written that"? Of course, that was my answer right there. Hiaasen could've written "Tricky Business." The thing the novel was missing, above all else, was Dave Barry himself.

Pick up "Big Trouble," flip to any page and read a few paragraphs. There's no question that the narrator is Dave Barry. He's a third-person omniscient narrator who finds the story he's telling so damn ridiculous, he can't help but make fun of the whole thing. 

This isn't the case with "Tricky Business." If Barry is the narrator, someone must have put him on Ritalin before he started telling the story. It's more like an experiment in limitations; an attempt to downplay the nuances that make his writing so distinct. In essence, he's trying to make himself sound like a regular novelist and not like a humor columnist writing a novel.

And this is perfectly understandable from Barry's point of view. He has many detractors who believe that all he can do is string together his reliable catch-phrase punch lines, make a booger or fart reference and he's done. "Tricky Business" seems to be his response. He wants readers to think, "this could've been Hiaasen," because then he's proven that he's more than a one-trick pony with a Pulitzer won by luck rather than merit. 

Of course, other than his narration style being so held-back, "Tricky Business" has plenty for fans to laugh about. Barry's skill comes at noticing the strange things that happen in our hometown and exaggerating it just a tad so we can see it the way he does. For example, throughout the novel, characters will catch the local Miami news covering the storm hitting the city. When someone dies in the storm, the news teams sends out a reporter in a van who issues the warning "do not go out into the storm." Of course, he ends up getting killed and they have to send another reporter to cover that death, and so on until the death toll starts rising quickly. It's a silly set-up, but when you think about a certain local station here in Miami, it suddenly doesn't seem so implausible.

It's the Barry fans who ultimately might feel a bit cheated by the book. When you pick up something by Dave Barry, there are certain things you should expect from it. "Tricky Business" offers almost all those expectations. If fans wanted another Hiaasen novel, all they had to do was stop by the airport bookstore.

Headline: "River" helps unify communities of Miami
Author: Kimelsha Wright
&nbsp;
An upcoming event in December for the entire family, "Mouth of the River" showcases Florida International University and the University of Miami's efforts to bring innovative and intriguing theatre drama that goes beyond the stage and reaches out to the community. Art often times imitates life as may be the case in the theatre play "Mouth of the River," written and directed by Patricia Dolan.  This play will attempt to do more than just entertain and retell a story or a part of history, it is helping to educate and unify the community of Miami. Dolan explores the significance of the Tequesta ceremonial circle from its history all the way through present time using music and dance that is intended for the whole family



Actors from Florida International University and the University of Miami are working together for the first time. They were brought together on the stage to show unity between two universities that are located in "a city riffed with division and an inability to hold hands..." as was stated by Phillip M. Church, a professor of acting at FIU. '[This play is a] gesture to see students from different colleges working together to cross boundaries, and to share resources.' This is the third production of "Mouth of the River," previously in conjunction with the Dade Heritage Trust Festival, which has led efforts to save the 2,000-year-old Miami Circle archeological site. 



Controversy has surrounded the Miami Circle since its discovery in the summer of 1998.  The Miami Circle located on the southern bank of the Miami River in Downtown Miami, was the intended site for two new high-rise developments.  Individuals and organizations are still fighting to preserve the site and the keep the artifacts intact.  



"Mouth of the River," an interactive theatre work is part of a three day series presented by the Working Group for Pre-Modern Histories and Culture at FIU.  Showtime performances for "Mouth of the River" begin at 8p.m. on Friday Dec. 6 and Saturday Dec. 7 at the Wertheim Performing Art Center at FIU, University Park.  Performances on those days are open to the public, students and faculty.  There will be a special performance, free of charge with reservation, for students on December 5.  



On Dec. 8, the final day of the conference showcases a symposium featuring presentations with discussions by specialist from colleges and universities in North America and around the world.  The speakers will address Tequesta Miami in relations to the Miami Circle and other port cities in Asia and Africa that lie near the Tropic of Cancer. This event, which is free and open to the public, will be held from 1-5p.m. at the First Presbyterian Church of Miami at 609 Brickell Avenue, adjacent to the Miami Circle.



Tickets for the play are $8 student/faculty, $10 general.  For reservations and information call the FIU box office at (305) 348-3789

Headline: Santana celebrates spirituality
Author: Krystal Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Beck burst on to the music scene back in 1994 and urged us all to "get crazy with the Cheese Whiz." His single, "Loser," quickly catapulted him to stardom and what followed was record after record that experimented with styles ranging from hip-hop and folk to pop and rock 'n' roll.

His talent for reinvention is proven yet again in his eighth and latest album, Sea Change, a revisit to the acoustic journeys of 1998's Mutations with more psychedelic sadness. Although those who might be expecting to play this album at their next party will be disappointed, those who think pain makes for great art will surely be happy to linger in Beck's melancholic trip.

What he has managed to pull off is a spectacular collection of heartache ballads that will have you visiting old loves, lost loves and all the tragedies associated therewith.

 If you've just had your heart trampled on, this is the album to wail away with, but make sure you have some Kleenex at hand.

The lovelorn theme is no accident of course; the whole record is a long, controlled meditation on the recent end of Beck's eight-year relationship with his girlfriend. Like a true artist, he's taken all that post-breakup suffering as fodder for creating the best album of his career.

It can appropriately be called a masterpiece. That's no overstatement either. 

In Sea Change, he easily transforms from the freaked-out tendencies of 1999's Midnite Vultures to overtly serious and introspective lamentations. The change is significantly accomplished through Beck's singing. Surprisingly, throughout the album his vocals stand center-stage, hitting fresh heights of expression.

The first track, "Golden Age," opens with the initial goodbye to failed love and the lonely journey one embarks on in its wake. "Put your hands on the wheel/let the golden age begin," sings Beck. A spacey and windy feel created by the light background vocals coats the song with a displaced, ethereal landscape. The down-tempo acoustic guitar along with the lazy trickles of the keyboard also do their part to give a sensation of pain and fear. The lyrics are blunt and somber: "These days I barely get by/I don't even try." It's perfect for one of those solitary night drives. 

"Lonesome Tears" is another creatively depressing tune. "These tears just can't erase/I don't need them anymore," admits Beck in a slow-motion voice that almost sounds spoken. The echoes of the string arrangements (added by his father, David Campbell) give off a musical glow. The ghost-like chorus line invokes a dreamy feel that draws you in. 

"End of the Day" continues the grave trip across Relationship Deathville, opening with the lyrics, "I've seen the end of the day come too soon." The keyboards are used brilliantly here, dropping captivating, funeral-like melodies everywhere. Drums and percussion steadily move the depressing procession where Beck is the sole marcher and Pink Floyd-like effects are added successfully to paint a morose backdrop.

An acoustic guitar also adds to Beck's moving lament. The electric bass gives the song its bulk while straightforward and heartbreaking lyrics descend on the chorus line. "It's nothing that I haven't seen before/but it still kills me like it did before," says Beck. 

 "Little One" and "Paper Tiger" are perhaps the only throwbacks to Beck's previous efforts. They use amazing echoes, beautiful string orchestrations, and an elegant piano. For the most part though, the whole droning album is a high-polished testament from the wounded, handled with great elegance, grace and honesty. 

With producer Nigel Godrich (Radiohead and Flaming Lips), Beck has carved out a stunning gem. Even though you can hear all the influences (Leonard Cohen, Neil Young, Issac Hayes), it's capable of standing on its own. Yes, he's traded in his "two turn tables and a microphone" but nonetheless Sea Change is worth your money.

Headline: Pygmy stands tall
Author: John Lovell / Assistant Arts Editor
&nbsp;
What I love most about observing musicians is the crazy, trance-like facial gestures and body movements that creep out of them as they play. They're the most intimate expressions. As I sat listening in the junk-room/converted garage where Miami-based Pygmy rehearses, I struggled to keep my own body language from screaming out in amazement. Pygmy's style must remain unnamed because it's impossible to label them anything else but "an insanely beautiful panoply of every, and any, musical genre one can think of;" a title of unacceptable length. 

There is an overall indie rock structure to this band, but in all honesty, once you finally think you've figured out a genre to categorize Pygmy in, the song changes musical style. It's as if the song knows you're listening. The thought of this may seem nerve-racking but don't let the description fool you, this chameleon-like method is really something that each of the five band members have mastered and turned into sheer genius.

Three to four times a week, they convene at guitarist Max Johnston's house for laid back yet productive rehearsal. Joining Johnston are Kris Pabon on guitar; FIU student José Castello on bass guitar, piano and vocals; Jorge Rubiera on drums; and Edward Adames on lead vocals, auxiliary percussion, and bass (when Castello plays the piano). 

Pygmy began playing about two years ago. "It all just kind of happened, progressively," said Johnston. The convergence from chaos to charisma was very gradual. Initially, as members of a band often do, they would challenge each other. It took them some time to realize what they were doing and where they wanted to take their sound. 

Pygmy unanimously agreed that, among themselves, Billy Joel's The Stranger is the album most commonly listened to. Other artists such as Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa and The Flaming Lips all can be found among the unique melting pot of influences that has helped mold their sound.  Those are only the cornerstones though; other music styles such as jazz and even country equally take part in Pygmy's structure. 

Adames' singing and lyrical content adds an even greater twist with soft spitting prose, which is at times reminiscent of a pre-Make Yourself Incubus, that jumps to hardcore screams which are strategically placed without overkill.

"My lyrics are about different situations I encounter along with the band sometimes," said Adames.  "Some lyrics tell a story like 'The Future of 1980' and some songs are downright scary like 'You Can Die,' which we don't play anymore."

All in all, it is difficult and downright senseless to describe their sound with words alone; the only way you can really understand what I'm talking about is by listening to some of their songs:   "Remember Nelson," "Nous Vettements D'Hiver Sont Beaux" and "Arlo" among others.

Last summer, Pygmy took a small tour as far as New Orleans. The five members would pile in an old Ford Taurus, play a show and spend the night on the floor of whomever booked it.  The many adventures of touring produced the name of their upcoming album entitled Sleeping with Beautiful Beagles, which is self-explanatory. This winter, the group will be going as far north as Atlanta. 

As for their place in the South Florida scene, Castello returned the question to me with: "What scene?" He has a good point, but even so, they've seen a lot of support in cities like West Palm Beach, and even their Miami fan base is growing. They usually play local venues such as The Alley or Churchill's.

Collectively, Pygmy would like to be able to tour all the time and as far as possible, only taking time off to record. Just as any musician does, they desire room, support and the ability to reach as many people as they can with their music.  "We would love to have the freedom to create anything we want and see appreciation for it," said Castello. "Based on last summer's tour, it looks like that's something to look forward to, the crowds were great," adds Rubiera.

It all boils down to the love of music though, pure and simple. "We love showing each other and the audiences what we can do with music," said Johnston. "The creative process and how it all comes together is most amusing to me." 

"I'm really grateful that I work with these people," said Castello.  Adames added: "I can't imagine myself in any other serious band, ever," at which point all five members agreed. "We're all so full of ideas," says Pabon, who was silent most of the evening. "I don't think there's really any major threat of things going dry, we're very juicy."

Pygmy is the first local band in South Florida to display such an amazing talent. Every member has great ideas and there is an overwhelming aura of unity and friendship during practice. Yes, they possess all the elements of success, but more importantly, they're full of greatness. For more information, visit www.i-am-pygmy.org.

Headline: Quality games warm up winter break
Author: Mario M. Sarria Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Finally the Holidays are here, and with no school and a cold front around, there is nothing more to do than stay home playing videogames. As any gamer out there knows, this holiday season is a gold mine. From all three corners, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Gamecube, and the Sony Playstation 2 game makers are coming out swinging with enough AAA titles to keep you busy. Every genre, from stealth and action adventure to fighting, it's all here. 

Nintendo currently is battling it out with major titles this Christmas while vaporizing the kidding image. Enter "Metroid Prime," quite frankly the game of the year. After an eight-year silence, Nintendo has finally listened to its fans and released "Metroid Prime," a prequel of sorts to the "Metroid" series. Fans will find themselves back upon a barren alien world to combat space pirates. 

The major change is the first person perspective which, thanks to Retro Studios, is superb. Many felt the series would be destroyed by the transition to 3-D. But gamers will be floored by the incredible visuals, like Samus' face reflected off her visor as lights flash, or the refraction of light as her cannon's shot warps the view around her in the incredible heat of the blast. The art direction is the best in any videogame and the boss battles are spectacular. 

Currently exclusive to Nintendo is the "Resident Evil" series, which sees the release of the latest installment in the franchise, "Resident Evil Zero." This is the best installment to date. Originally conceived a Nintendo 64 game, Capcom overhauled this game for the Gamecube system. 

The game features high production values, especially in the art design and music department. Unlike other survival horror games, "Zero" doesn't attempt to scare you with cheap trills and the new enemies don't pop out to scare you. Instead, they creep you out just by standing there. The new leech zombies are practically ripped out of an Adam Jones music video (refer to any music video from the band Tool) with a grotesque animation style reminiscent of Marilyn Manson's concert imagery. 

The game features the best musical score in any survival horror game, hands down. The sound track features fully orchestrated music in Dolby Prologic II sound. 

Moving over to the Sony Playstation 2, we have "Ratchet & Clank," a high-quality action adventure game with personality. Looking like something straight out of an animated sci-fi film like "Titan A. E." or "Treasure Planet", the game features expansive levels, extensive voice-acting and impressively animated characters.

 Visually the game is very colorful with a great amount of elements on screen at all times while keeping a rock-solid 60 frames per second. The game features a great story along with a world that Insomniac Studios have created inside the PS2. 

Unfortunately, if you suffer motion sickness, avoid this like the plague. The demon that haunts all 3D games, the camera, is a culprit in this affair. The camera has the nasty habit of spinning around to get behind Ratchet when he runs around or changes direction. 

For the role-playing game fans out there, Konami has released their best game since "Metal Gear Solid," "Suikoden 3." The RPG is based on one of the greatest Chinese novels. Fans of "Final Fantasy 3" will be happy to know that "Suikoden 3" follows the same method of story telling, where you choose to see different aspects of the story told though different characters. Only this time, "Suikoden 3" one-ups the system with the Trinity Sight System, which is almost like living a story though the eyes of multiple people. The unique cast of characters feature models that deserve attention. 

With the 80 hours of game play "Suikoden 3" provides, as well as the overall presentation, story and visual design, no RPG enthusiast can be without "Suikoden 3."

Over on the Microsoft Xbox side we have the most impressive game to one-up "Halo" in its field. Any "Metal Gear" fan should not be without "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell." This is hands down the most impressive stealth game I've ever played. 

Although Splinter Cell may seem very difficult due to the smart enemy AI, this game is truly the closest to the real thing. And if that isn't enough for you, the game offers full 5.1 Surround sound. 

The programmers did not just add a light source here and there. They literally made heavy use of Xbox's GPU's vertex and pixel-shader effect by programming accurately the behavior of every type of light source in the game. It's a complete real world lighting physics engine that has to be seen to believed. 

As beautiful as it is, light is your foe in Splinter Cell. You must exercise caution and dwell in the shadows: it is probably the most accurate simulation of stealth available in a video game to date.

To wrap things up, "Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance" is honestly the best fighter since Namco's "Soul Calibur." The game features great visuals, a fun and deep fighting system and tons of extras. 

Right from the get-go, the game comes with two 15 minute features on the making of "Deadly Alliance" and the history of "Mortal Kombat," as well as the full length video of Adema's "Immortal" video. 

Characters have been transformed both in art direction and animation. Now every fighter features three styles of combat, which they can mix and combine in different combinations. The new fighting styles are actual martial arts fighting styles, which are animated beautifully, fast and furious, through motion capture. 

The fighting styles are well balanced as well. Included is the "Kryp," where you purchase "Koffins" with "Kombat Koins" you earn in the game. You can unlock extras such as hidden characters, costumes, "Mortal Kombat" memorabilia, videos of the background stage test and much more. 

On top of that, the game includes a full comprehensive training mode called "Konquest," which literally guides you though all of the character's fighting styles and techniques, and is second only to "Virtua Fighter 4"'s superior training mode. 

Regardless of platform, "Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance" is an outstanding  experience that gives you more for your dollar, and, along with the other recommended games, can cure the Holiday blues.

Headline: Christina Aguilera makes fierce return
Author: Kimelsha Wright / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
No longer a "Genie in a Bottle," this time around Christina Aguilera is "Dirrty." 

With the release of her fourth full-length album, Stripped, the 21 year-old New York native makes a fierce comeback. The first single released, "Dirrty," featuring rapper Redman, introduces the singer's new, unrestrained image. 

Aguilera entered the music scene in 1997 when she gained recognition for the song "Reflections," from Disney's full-length animated movie soundtrack, Mulan. Two years later, Aguilera released her self-titled debut album. She rose to stardom with up-tempo, pop-friendly songs and a squeaky clean image to match.   

Stripped is different from what fans and the public are used to hearing or would expect from Aguilera. Not one song is indicative of the album as a whole.  Listeners can expect a departure from the normal pop sound and wholesome good-girl persona. Aguilera may have lost a few young fans, but has gained many  new ones. Fans can expect an album that not only reflects the singer's natural progression into maturity, but also reflects her personal side and emotional vulnerabilities. The songs on the album resemble a collection of journal entries set to music. 

Bombarded with accusations and rumors about other musicians in the industry, the singer does what few artists choose to do, she addresses them. She tackles personal issues dealing with heartbreak and betrayal in songs like "Infatuation" and "Make Over," and childhood problems in "I'm Okay."  She sings about love - love for yourself and for family.  She lays it all out in the open.  

Christina Aguilera boasts about an album with no hype and no pretenses about who she is.  The mood of the album is mellow with musical influences from many genres.  Stripped is a collage of musical sounds from R & B, hip-hop, neo-soul, jazz, latin, rock and retro.  All but two songs on the album were co-written and co-composed by Aguilera, and she is credited as an executive producer.  

There are many rebirths in the music industry by artists who strive for self-improvement, control or simply attention. Christina Aguilera has produced an album that seems honest, distinguishable and stripped of the superficial.

Headline: Ciudadanía y policía unen esfuerzos

&nbsp;
Los crímenes en el área de North Miami Beach han disminuido considerablemente con la creación de programas para la prevención del crimen y el realce del ornato en la ciudad, según informaciones del Departamento de Policía de esa ciudad.

Este posee en la actualidad 130 agentes juramentados, más de 80 empleados civiles y una gran cantidad de ciudadanos voluntarios. Sin embargo, el Programa de Policía Comunitaria cuenta solamente con nueve efectivos policiales que cubren las seis zonas de la ciudad. 

Para muchos, es la agencia policial más profesional y avanzada del país. Según A. Lowe, agente del Departamento de Policía de Florida International University, esta agencia es una de las mejores. 

&#8220;Está acreditada y cuenta con William Berger, jefe de la Asociación Nacional de Policías, como jefe del departamento&#8221;, dijo Lowe. 

En 1991, se convirtió en la primera agencia policial del condado de Miami-Dade en recibir acreditación internacional a través de la &#8220;Commission on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies&#8221;. 

Para 1994, la solución de problemas no era un concepto nuevo para la policía de North Miami Beach. Desde 1987, Berger enviaba agentes a la ciudad de Flint, Michigan, para visitar el Departamento de Policía de Flint (DPF). Entonces, el DPF era el hogar de uno de los primeros programas de policía comunitaria de los Estados Unidos. Allí, los agentes de Berger aprendieron los métodos del programa orientado a la comunidad que enfatiza las actividades en los vecindarios, las estrategias para la prevención del crimen y el desarrollo de habilidades para la resolución de problemas.

En un inicio se les pidió a los agentes que pensaran y actuaran de manera diferente al uso policíaco tradicional. Para el detective Nelson Reyes fue difícil acostumbrarse al cambio. 

&#8220;Cuando entré al Programa de Policía Comunitaria, los vehículos no tenían jaulas en la parte trasera. Yo era activo en la calle y, al llegar al programa, encontré que era más una organización social que criminalista. Le habían quitado una de las funciones básicas de la policía: apresar a los criminales. Hablé con el jefe encargado, Marshall B. Gage, y le pedí permiso para manejar mi patrulla y hacer arrestos. De ahí en adelante, se autorizó que todos los vehículos del programa tuvieran jaulas&#8221;, explicó Reyes.

El programa se basa en la premisa de que toda la población de una comunidad es responsable por su seguridad pública. Los agentes de policía son asignados a comunidades específicas y trabajan cerca de sus líderes para lograr una mayor integración en la prevención del crimen. 

De esta forma, llegan a conocer a los residentes de la comunidad para la cual trabajan, escuchan sus quejas y los hacen formar parte de la búsqueda de soluciones para los problemas que afectan el área. Esto se logra a través de la integración de la comunidad a las reuniones de vigilancia, asociaciones de vecinos y sesiones del Concejo Municipal. Los agentes de policía se convierten en el enlace entre los ciudadanos y la ciudad. 

&#8220;Hemos roto la barrera entre la ciudad, los residentes y la policía, porque tenemos tiempo para visitarlos y hacer amistades. Estamos en contacto con los líderes de las comunidades y sabemos los problemas que afectan la ciudad&#8221;, precisó el cabo Alex Morales, líder del Programa de Policía Comunitaria.

El programa abarca la violencia doméstica, el tráfico y consumo de drogas, los robos a viviendas y a vehículos y el mantenimiento del ornato de la ciudad. 

Además, hace cuatro años, el departamento creó el programa &#8220;Kids Saving Our Neighborhoods&#8221; (K.-SON) diseñado para que los jóvenes que cometen delitos dentro de la ciudad aprendan a asumir la responsabilidad por sus acciones y retribuyan a la comunidad a través de su trabajo.

El crimen, en todas sus categorías, ha disminuido en North Miami Beach, gracias a la introducción del Programa de Policía Comunitaria. 

&#8220;El crimen ha bajado en nuestra ciudad pero la población ha aumentado&#8221;, recalcó el cabo Morales.  

Reyes coincide con una reducción en las cifras de crímenes. Aunque la disminución puede atribuirse en parte a los cambios del departamento, factores como la economía, el ambiente y la dinámica poblacional pueden formar parte de la ecuación. 

A través de los años, la cantidad de quejas ha disminuido, así también el crimen. Los cambios en el departamento pueden estar ligados a los logros en las comunidades.

Esto, sin embargo, no molesta a la agente Beth Fernández. &#8220;El verdadero éxito está en que hemos mejorado el estado de la comunidad&#8221;, dijo Fernández. &#8220;Nuestros índices de satisfacción se han disparado. Contamos actualmente con un 87 por ciento de índice de aprobación (de parte de la comunidad)&#8221;. 

De ahí que, para el Departamento de Policía de North Miami Beach, el éxito se puede medir en términos diferentes.

Headline: Esperanza para niños desaparecidos
Subheadline: Carla Valero
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Los Ryce eran un matrimonio feliz, ambos abogados, que junto a su hijo Jimmy de 9 años vivían en Homestead, al sur de Miami. 

El 11 de septiembre de 1995, hacia las 3:30 p.m.,  Jimmy bajó del autobús escolar y, como cada día, empezó a andar los escasos bloques que le separaban de su casa. Ese día fue la última vez que vieron al niño con vida. Chávez, un hombre mentalmente enfermo, lo secuestró a mano de pístola, lo introdujo a su camioneta y lo llevó a su casa móvil, en donde lo violó, torturó, mató y finalmente descuartizó.

Ese día, los padres de Jimmy se encontraban de viaje. Al enterarse de su desaparición, volvieron a casa para buscarlo.

La ley federal precisa que no es necesario esperar un período de 12 horas para iniciar una búsqueda si el desaparecido es menor de 18 años. Así que cuando los padres de Jimmy llegaron a casa hacia las 7:30 p.m., la policía del condado de Miami-Dade ya estaba  trabajando en el caso. 

Don y Claudine Ryce cuentan su trágica experiencia.

&#8220;Pasamos tres meses buscando desesperadamente a nuestro hijo y nos dimos cuenta de los métodos y procedimientos tan ineficaces que existían en la recuperación de niños desaparecidos. Se desperdiciaron muchas horas y al FBI no se le notificó la desaparición hasta pasadas 24 horas&#8221;, dice Don Ryce, quien añade que, pesar de la experiencia y los medios con los que los agentes policiales cuentan, no pudieron hacer nada para encontrar a Jimmy. Tampoco se trajo al lugar a ningún perro Bloodhound para que rastreara el camino, hasta que no habían pasado días de la desaparición.

Finalmente, a los 3 meses, los miembros del cuerpo del pequeño Jimmy fueron encontrados en unas vasijas de barro, cerca de la casa móvil donde vivía el asesino. Chavez fue detenido y posteriormente condenado por asesinato y abuso sexual.

 Búsqueda de soluciones 

Ante esta dramática experiencia, los Ryce se propusieron remediar algunos de los problemas con los que se encontraron, a fin de que el próximo niño desaparecido fuera hallado en menos tiempo y posiblemente con vida. 

Para ello, primero intentaron cooperar con organizaciones ya existentes, pero después de varias decepciones - porque dichas asociaciones se dedicaban &#8220;más a buscar fondos y créditos que a hacer un buen trabajo&#8221; - los Ryce decidieron fundar su propia organización para niños desparecidos en nombre de su hijo.

&#8220;En 1996, creamos el centro para las víctimas de secuestros Jimmy Ryce. Esta organización sin ánimo de lucro, se dedica a luchar contra los abusadores sexuales y secuestradores de niños, ya sean familiares, vecinos o cualquier extraño&#8221;, dice Ryce.

Esta fundación ha trabajado duro desde su creación. Prueba de ello son los logros que ha conseguido como el hecho de que el ex-presidente Bill Clinton firmara un memorándum ejecutivo que requiere que los edificios federales muestren las imágenes de niños desaparecidos. Así fue como Clinton respondió a la petición de los Ryce, apoyada por más de medio millón de firmas de estadounidenses. 

Además, los Ryce, junto con otros cuatro padres de hijos desaparecidos redactaron el manual &#8220;Cuando tu hijo está desaparecido: una guía para la supervivencia de la familia&#8221;, publicado en la página web del Departamento de Justicia, desde mayo de 1998 (http://www.ncjrs.org/html/ojjdp/childmissing_guide_02/contents.html).

Ryce, portavoz y figura pública de la fundación, explica que el centro fue creado para ayudar a los padres, reforzar la ley y dar a conocer a las comunidades qué pueden hacer para buscar a niños desaparecidos. No obstante, el objetivo principal es hacer a los niños más fuertes y resistentes ante un ataque, ya que, en último término, su propia defensa es el único medio que puede salvarlos.

La Fundación Jimmy Ryce distribuye fotografías de niños desaparecidos y trata de darles cobertura en los medios. También proporciona información a las escuelas, da soporte y consejo a las familias que han sido víctimas de un abusador sexual, identifican la legislación y designan programas de protección para los más pequeños.

 El mejor amigo del hombre 

Una de las tareas más desconocidas de la fundación es que proporciona perros Bloodhound a los departamentos de policía en los Estados Unidos, para ayudar en la búsqueda de desaparecidos.

La fundación también permite a las familias y personas particulares adoptar a uno de los perros, siempre y cuando obtengan un permiso del departamento de policía y se comprometan a ceder el perro para cuando se le requiera en una búsqueda.

Para mantener el perro en una casa, es necesario que la familia complete un expediente del perro, lo haya educado y entrenado adecuadamente, así como que el perro haya encontrado a algún niño desaparecido.

&#8220;The Jimmy Ryce Boodhound Network&#8221; ha colocado ya a 100 perros en diversos departamentos de policía de todo el país. A nivel local, la policía de Medley, la Oficina del alguacil de Broward y la ciudad de Sweetwater, son algunas de las muestras del éxito del programa.   

Según Ryce, no es una tarea fácil puesto que no todos los policías quieren o pueden llevarse este tipo de perro a casa. 

&#8220;No son perros de ataque que te vayan a morder, todo lo que pueden hacer es chuparte el cuerpo&#8221;, dice Ryce.

El mismo se dedica a enseñar y convencer a la policía del importante papel que pueden jugar los Bloodhound cuando de salvar la vida de un niño se trata.

&#8220;Ellos (los agentes policiales) creen que cualquier perro policía es capaz de realizar el mismo trabajo, pero no es verdad. El Bloodhound es el único perro que puede detectar el olor de una persona pasadas 12 horas de su desaparición o una esencia desde el sistema de ventilación de un carro, así que las ventajas quedan demostradas y es algo que cada comunidad necesita&#8221;, asegura Ryce.

El Bloodhound es un perro especial, puede llegar a pesar 100 libras y suele vivir unos 10 años. A pesar de que dicen que las hembras dan mejor resultado en las búsquedas, esto no ha podido demostrarse. Macho y hembra son eficaces si son bien entrenados. 

Su sentido del olfato es 60 veces superior al del pastor alemán y puede ayudar a la policía a identificar sospechosos de violación o de otros crímenes mucho tiempo después de que cometieron el delito. Incluso, pueden encontrar a las víctimas a más de cuatro millas de distancia.

 En Sweetwater 

Una de las comisarías que se ha adherido al proyecto es la de la ciudad de Sweetwater. 

El agente de policía Sergio Cabrera es el jefe del equipo K-9, que se encarga del  adiestramiento de los perros donados por la Fundación Jimmy Rice.

La idea surgió hace cuatro años cuando Ed Fuentes, asistente del jefe de policía de Sweetwater, se reunió con los Ryce.

&#8220;Hablamos sobre la creación de la organización y sobre lo que le pasó a su hijo. Sentí un dolor y una impotencia tan grande al escucharlos que enseguida acepté la propuesta. Como padre puedo entender por todo lo que pasaron y me solidarizo totalmente con la causa, creo que están haciendo un buen trabajo&#8221;, dice Fuentes.

El K-9 es un programa extendido por los Estados Unidos. En Sweetwater está compuesto por cuatro perros, los cuales no tienen contacto entre sí. Dos se han destinado al Departamento de Narcóticos y uno para la detección de bombas. Por su parte, Nicole, una Bloodhound de tres años, se encarga de buscar a los niños desaparecidos. Cabrera es su responsable y entrenador. 

&#8220;El agente Fuentes la trajo cuando aún era una cachorra y decidí encargarme de ella. Vive conmigo en casa, aunque es un poco alborotadora&#8221;, dice Cabrera.

Nicole inició su entrenamiento cuando tenía seis meses y lo continúa. A pesar de no ser toda una experta, ya ha cooperado en cinco casos de desaparición en varias ciudades del sur de Florida. 

Cabrera recuerda el caso de Pinecrest. 

&#8220;Ocurrió en octubre el año pasado. Era un domingo que yo estaba en casa con Nicole. Un niño autista salió de su casa y se perdió. Normalmente, estos casos los lleva el Departamento de Policía de Miami-Dade, pero en ese momento no podían acudir al lugar así que remitieron el caso al K-9. Recibimos la llamada de su familia y rápidamente nos dirigimos al lugar de la desaparición. La familia le dio a Nicole una almohada del niño para oler y Nicole empezó a buscar. Acertó justo el camino por donde el pequeño se había marchado. Gracias a eso, los familiares lo encontraron a las pocas horas, cuando casualmente venía de vuelta a casa&#8221;, recuerda Cabrera.

El agrega que para entrenar al perro se necesitan muchas horas, es un proceso largo que no termina nunca y requiere mucha paciencia. Nicole se lo toma todo como un juego, le tiran una pelota, le esconden objetos y recorre distancias, las cuales se van haciendo más largas. 

El sistema de búsqueda está directamente ligado con el sentido del olfato del perro y con el rastro que deja en el camino la persona desaparecida.

&#8220;Todos tenemos un olor corporal diferente. Al caminar, vamos soltando partículas de olor que van impregnando los lugares por los que pasamos. En superficies lisas como rocas o el suelo, el olor es más difícil de sentir porque no se queda tan impregnado como si caminamos por la hierba u otras superficies más suaves. Si las condiciones climáticas no son óptimas, las partículas pueden moverse de sitio debido al viento, la lluvia o la nieve, lo que puede despistar al perro en su búsqueda&#8221;, explica Cabrera.

Sin embargo, las sesiones de entrenamiento suelen ser de dos horas varias veces a la semana. Existen diversos tipos de ejercicios que se hacen en diferentes escenarios para que el perro no se acostumbre al mismo sitio.

Por ejemplo, un jueves, a las 9 de la mañana, Cabrera se dirige con su Bloodhound a un descampado, a las afueras de Sweetwater. El primer ejercicio consiste en que una persona se esconda tras unas rocas, a media milla de distancia y Nicole la encuentre. 

Esta huele una camisa e inmediatamente empieza la búsqueda. Es un día soleado y sin mucho viento. No han pasado ni 10 minutos y la Bloodhound ya ha encontrado a la persona que estaba semienterrada. 

Cabrera explica: &#8220;Nicole ha completado el ejercicio con éxito aunque ha perdido un poco la pista cuando ha pasado por las piedras, ya que es una superficie lisa y le cuesta más seguir el rastro&#8221;. 

Para que el policía sepa si el perro ha encontrado a la persona o no, o si por lo menos se encuentra por buen camino, debe fijarse en lo que hace y entenderlo. 

&#8220;Cada perro tiene una forma distinta de expresarse. Algunos ladran para hacerte saber que han descubierto algo, otros mueven insistentemente la cola y otros giran a su alrededor. Nicole es una perra difícil porque no suele expresarse de ninguna manera y me ha llevado tiempo entenderla. No es un trabajo fácil, la comunicación entre el animal y el entrenador es la clave del éxito&#8221;, añade Cabrera.

El segundo ejercicio del día es el &#8220;Split Scene&#8221; y se hace en un escenario diferente. Esta práctica es de nivel superior a la anterior. Se trata de que un individuo se cruce en el camino que ha seguido la persona desaparecida para despistar al perro.

Nicole huele una chaqueta y empieza a correr. Justo en el sitio donde se ha cruzado otra persona se detiene y empieza a oler con más atención. No puede equivocarse de olor y lo debe retener en la memoria para no seguir a la persona equivocada. Al poco rato, la Bloodhound continúa por el camino del desaparecido hasta que lo encuentra. Una vez más, Nicole ha superado la prueba. 

&#8220;Me siento orgulloso de ella pues, a pesar de que no es uno de los mejores perros, hace un trabajo excelente. Soy consciente de la dificultad de los entrenamientos y cada vez vamos aumentando el grado y las distancias&#8221;, dice.

Al ver a Nicole es difícil no tomarle aprecio puesto que es cariñosa y buena. A pesar de las miradas de complicidad entre el cuidador y Nicole, Cabrera aclara que &#8220;el problema de tener un perro de estos es que no puedes encariñarte mucho, es un error tratarlo como un animal de compañía porque entonces no hace bien su trabajo. Recuerdo que cuando Nicole era sólo una cachorra, quería estar conmigo todo el tiempo y tuve muchos problemas para que no se acostumbrara&#8221;, dice Cabrera.

De hecho, los bloodhounds tienen que estar siempre concentrados, sin distracciones. Son perros de trabajo, no animales domésticos y &#8220;hay que tener cuidado de no permitirles demasiados caprichos&#8221;.

Cabrera conoce muy bien a estos perros. Por esta razón, lo invitan a menudo a convenciones y congresos para hablar de los Bloodhound. También organiza sesiones en las escuelas para enseñarles a los niños a saber defenderse de los abusadores sexuales y de lo que hacen los perros para buscar a niños desaparecidos. 

Asimismo, durante esas sesiones, el agente cuenta los orígenes de esta raza. Los bloodhounds son originarios de Gran Bretaña y vienen del siglo XII. Se les llama así porque las personas que los tenían eran de sangre real y los utilizaban para cazar animales debido a su buen olfato. En el siglo XVII, llegaron a los Estados Unidos como perros cazadores. Pero años más tarde se utilizaron para buscar a los esclavos que se escapaban. No fue sino hasta mediados del siglo XX que los Bloodhounds se usaron para buscar a personas desaparecidas.

Cabrera afirma que se siente orgulloso de compaginar su trabajo como agente de policía y como jefe del equipo K-9 de Sweetwater. Además, anima a todos los vecinos a que adopten estos perros porque &#8220;es para el beneficio de la comunidad&#8221;. 

&#8220;La Fundación Jimmy Ryce esta haciendo un buen trabajo con las donaciones de perros a los departamentos de policía. El tiempo ha demostrado que son efectivos y pueden evitar muchos disgustos. Lástima que el día que desapareció Jimmy, no estuviera Nicole para acudir al rescate. Quizás su muerte se hubiera podido evitar y ahora no estaríamos hablando de este tema&#8221;, concluye Cabrera.

&nbsp;
"Cuando muera quiero que me entierren aquí", comenta sonriente la señora Lottie Pearson mientras se pierde su mirada en un horizonte de tumbas y escombros.

"Visité el cementerio y no estaba contenta con lo que estaba viendo. Así que decidí tomar la restauración del mismo como un proyecto personal", añade.

Lottie, quien ya pasa de sesenta años, habla entusiasmada de un proyecto que describe como una experiencia espiritual. Desde febrero de este año, se ha dado a la tarea de reconstruir el Cementerio Histórico de Coconut Grove. 

Las raíces de la comunidad que vio crecer a Lottie están en este cementerio.  Levantado en 1906, por los primeros pobladores del Grove, este cementerio fue el primero en el sur de la Florida en utilizarse para enterrar a los inmigrantes bahameños, fundadores del West Grove. 

Parte de su importancia recae en su arquitectura que contiene 12 marcadores antropomórficos o piedras de "cabeza y hombro". Estos son únicos en la región de Miami-Dade y reflejan  el vínculo del vecindario con las Bahamas.

Hoy día, agentes de la policía del sur de Miami describen al West Grove como una comunidad pobre, mantenida por las drogas, con una cultura que no encaja con la del resto de la ciudad. Sin embargo, Lottie se ha dado a la tarea de desenterrar el espíritu de los primeros pobladores, así como el de generaciones de historia, sufrimientos y alegrías que han formado el West Grove que ella conoce.   

Lottie, se mudó a Cleaveland, Ohio, en su juventud para ejercer su profesión de enfermería. Allí se destacó como activista social en la lucha contra las drogas. Por lo mismo, recibió, como reconocimiento, las llaves de la ciudad por parte del gobernador. Es un premio del que habla orgullosa. 

Retirada en el West Grove, Lottie dice que desea poner su conocimiento al servicio de la comunidad. Además de organizar el comité para la reconstrucción del Cementerio Histórico, Lottie también ejerce sus funciones como vice presidenta de la Asociación de Dueños de Vivienda.

 "Cuatro meses atrás no se podía ver de un lado del cementerio al otro. Parecía un basurero. Ahora hay paz y, con la ayuda de Dios, lo vamos a terminar", dice.

Lottie aprovechó su posición en la comunidad para atraer voluntarios a trabajar en la limpieza, restauración y pintura del cementerio. También recibió donaciones de la Alianza Nacional de Empleados Federales y Postales y de familiares de personas enterradas en el camposanto. El flujo de voluntarios ha mermado a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero Lottie continúa firme en su misión. 

"Al principio había un grupo grande que venía todos los sábados. Ahora sólo somos unos cuantos. Pero no importa, sé que Dios me va a ayudar", afirma.

Bajo el sol candente de un sábado de septiembre, ella dirige a un grupo de reos que limpia los últimos escombros que quedan en el cementerio. El grupo ha llegado allí por gestiones de autoridades del condado de Miami-Dade. 

Para el que observa, parece que ella guía al grupo de presidiarios con la misma dedicación como lo hace con los niños voluntarios de un colegio vecino, quienes pintan las tumbas deterioradas.

Lottie tiene grandes planes para el Cementerio Histórico. Quiere construir un jardín de mariposas, traer bancos de descanso y organizar excursiones educativas que den a conocer la historia del cementerio. También ha contratado a una persona para que le dé mantenimiento.

"Cuando termino mi trabajo del día, sólo quiero quedarme y caminar un rato. Hablo con mi padre y mi hermana enterrados aquí y siento paz", dice. Es esta paz la que quiere transmitir a la comunidad que rodea al cementerio. 

Lottie recibió un reconocimiento de parte de Jonny L. Winton, comisionado de la zona, por su labor en el cementerio. Su verdadera satisfacción yace en sentirse un instrumento de Dios y ver terminada la misión que, según ella , El le ha puesto en las manos.

Headline: Judíos promueven una conexión latina
Subheadline: Karen Azucena
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Este es un tiempo de shinuy o cambio para la comunidad judía de la Ciudad de Aventura en el noreste de Miami, Florida. 

	El Año Nuevo les ha traído a los descendientes de Abraham la oportunidad de realizar un "inventario espiritual" de sus vidas, además de ofrecerles una bandeja llena de desafíos ante la llegada de cientos de inmigrantes latinoamericanos, judíos y no judíos. 

	Uno de ellos es Mario Rojzman, el rabino que el Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center- Beth Jacob (ATJC) invitó para que, en un período de un año, establezca una "conexión especial" con los judíos hispanos de esa ciudad.

	Argentino, padre de familia y coautor del libro "Todos los caminos conducen a Jerusalén... y también a Roma", el invitado explica el motivo de su presencia en el sur de la Florida. 

	"He venido para hacer una conexión latina y crear un espacio para que los valores en los que los hispanos crecimos puedan desarrollarse con el condimento judaico", afirma Rojzman en referencia a la conservación de la costumbre latinoamericana de rezar y asistir a los servicios religiosos "en familia". 

	Y es que Aventura, la municipalidad número 28 del condado de Miami-Dade con una población de 27 mil habitantes, está experimentando un incremento en la inmigración hispana, comparada a la que se suscitó a principios de los años ochenta, asegura Jeffrey Perlow, alcalde de Aventura y vice presidente de la junta directiva del ATJC.

	Aunque aún no dispone de estadísticas sobre esta nueva ola de inmigrantes, el alcalde reconoce que ésta ha generado un impacto significativo en la ciudad. También ve la necesidad de satisfacer sus necesidades espirituales. 

	"Cualquier iglesia o sinagoga que esté dispuesta a ofrecer servicios a una comunidad tan grande beneficia a la ciudad y la presenta como un espacio abierto y diverso", dice Perlow. 

	Pero, ¿a qué obedece la necesidad de atender a los recién llegados dentro de una comunidad pudiente y orientada a los negocios, como lo es Aventura?

	Rojzman explica esta necesidad desde la filosofía de la corriente judía conservadora, a la que tanto él como el ATJC pertenecen. 

	A su juicio, la tradición y el cambio mantienen una "permanente tensión constructiva". De ahí que el reto de los rabinos es tomar en una mano la Torah (la Biblia) y en la otra, el diario, como un símbolo de modernidad. 

	En este sentido, añade Rojzman, los líderes del ATJC vieron en su persona al perfil del rabino que los nuevos inmigrantes necesitan. Se ha reconocido que es indispensable "alcanzarlos" a través de actividades especiales, sermones y rezos en español, todo esto sin cambiar ni una jota ni una tilde de la tradición judaica. 

	"Parte de mi trabajo es demostrar que el judaismo no es un desafío a cumplir rituales sino a vivir valores, como la acción social, la solidaridad y el vínculo con Israel", dice Rojzman. 

	En esto se ocupará el rabino durante el año que durará su invitación, la cual podría extenderse, afirma Perlow. 

	Este reitera que le gustaría que Rojzman desarrollara un "templo dentro del templo", en donde se ofrezcan opciones para los distintos segmentos de la comunidad.

	En concreto, Rojzman ha empezado a organizar los servicios en español de los viernes, en preparación para el Sabbath. El considera que de los mil 700 miembros del ATJC, un cinco por ciento es hispano y puede beneficiarse de la 'conexión latina'. Además, cada quince días ofrecerá cursos sabatinos en las casas, con el fin de poner en acción los valores del judaismo mediante un programa de voluntariado.

	Asimismo, Rojzman se encargará de planear actividades especiales para los 70 niños judíos hispanos que estudian en la escuela Herman and Miriam Tauber del ATJC. 

	"Si uno pone la semilla, la gente aparece. Y esto es especialmente cierto en el caso de los latinoamericanos. Nosotros mostramos más interés (que los anglosajones) en las actividades religiosas", afirma Rojzman, al recordar que unos 550 judíos hispanos abarrotaron el primer servicio en español el  8 de septiembre, durante Rosh Hashaná, la celebración judía en la que se proclama a Dios como Soberano absoluto del universo. En esa ocasión, dice Rojzman, el servicio judío anglosajón congregó a 32 personas.

	Con una trayectoria de 11 años como rabino de Beth-El en Buenos Aires, Argentina, Rojzman se siente "listo" para conquistar sus nuevos retos. Aparte de haber egresado del Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano, Rojzman obtuvo una maestría en Filosofía y Ciencias de la Educación por parte de la Universidad Hebrea en Jerusalén. 

	"Como comunidad nos involucramos en la lucha por los derechos humanos en una Argentina constantemente violada por distintas dictaduras", añade. 

	Y no sólo eso. En Buenos Aires, Rojzman mantuvo un programa televisivo en conjunto con un obispo católico. Cada domingo por la noche, ellos abordaban diversos temas, por ejemplo, el diálogo entre religiones. Sin duda, esta experiencia le será útil ante la presencia de los hispanos no judíos que también están llegando a Aventura. 

¿Rivalidad o cooperación?

Históricamente, la cuerda de las relaciones entre los hispanos católicos y los judíos del sur de la Florida se ha mantenido estirada. Esta situación, dice Rojzman, le provee "más tarea por hacer".

Para el rabino Héctor Appelbaum, de la Hebrew Cuban Congregation- Beth Shmuel, de South Beach, el desconocimiento y la influencia de la cultura latinoamericana y la inquisición católica han permitido la implantación de ciertos prejuicios antisemitas, "sobre todo en los hispanos que nacieron y se criaron en Latinoamérica".

Appelbaum cita el estudio de la Liga Antidifamación, el cual determinó, en una encuesta nacional realizada el año pasado, que un 22 por ciento de los hispanos muestra algún tipo de prejuicio u opinión contra los judíos. 

"Es curioso que entre los encuestados de origen hispano pero nacidos y educados en la cultura norteamericana, el índice de antisemitismo baja al 15 por ciento", asegura.

La Liga Antidifamación es una organización judía cuyo objetivo es mejorar las relaciones entre las comunidades judías y no judías. Según el rabino, tres empresas de encuestas llevaron a cabo el muestreo, con un índice de error del dos al tres por ciento.

¿Cómo se manifiestan los prejuicios contra los judíos? Appelbaum señala ejemplos clásicos. 

"Hasta que el Papa (Juan Pablo II) decidió quitar de la liturgia toda referencia de que los judíos mataron a Jesús, la tendencia de la Iglesia era enseñar al judío como un ser maligno, asesino, que se sirve de los católicos para su beneficio propio, usurero y aprovechador", recalca el rabino.

No obstante, en los dos meses que ha vivido en South Beach, el argentino Appelbaum no ha notado conflictos, muestras de indiferencia ni problemas serios entre las comunidades hispana y judía.

Una similar opinión mantiene Elaine Adler, presidenta del Aventura Marketing Council.

"No veo una distinción entre las personas que vienen a Aventura para vivir y hacer negocios. En nuestras reuniones (del Aventura Marketing Council), somos 250 personas de distintas nacionalidades y religiones. Nos conectamos para hacer negocios sin ninguna tensión", asegura Adler.

Pero tampoco existe una comunidad hispana organizada ni representada en el gobierno local de Aventura. 

El alcalde Perlow sostiene que "no hay necesidad de que los hispanos se organicen puesto que se les brinda un trato semejante al de los demás residentes de la ciudad". 

Perlow tampoco ve la posibilidad inmediata de que los hispanos de Aventura participen activamente en la política local. A su juicio, esto podría ocurrir en unos 10 ó 15 años, cuando los inmigrantes hayan obtenido su ciudadanía y su derecho para votar.

Los nuevos hispanos de esta ciudad tampoco cuentan con líderes religiosos separados de la tradición judía. 

Dentro de Aventura, se han construido tres templos hebreos. Una sola iglesia bautista (de 50 miembros) se ubica en el borde de la ciudad. Se trata de The Church at Aventura, cuyo pastor es el reverendo Williard Keyser, también capellán del Departamento de Policía de Aventura.

Si los recién llegados buscaran una iglesia católica, la parroquia más cercana la encontrarían en North Miami Beach. Es la St. Lawrence Catholic Church, bajo la guianza del sacerdote William Elbert. 

Adler puntualiza que, por el lado empresarial, Aventura está alcanzando a los hispanos que han llegado a hacer negocios. Para ello, se ha creado la International Business and Cultural Alliance, liderada por el abogado de inmigración Roger Bernstein. 

Pese a ello, el mexicano José Flores, un estudiante de la maestría en Administración de Empresas de Nova University y residente de Aventura, dice que no ha encontrado una organización no judía en la que se pueda involucrar activamente. 

A pesar de esta y otras carencias, el shinuy ha llegado a Aventura para marcar su pulso de ciudad de primera categoría. Perlow trae a colación las rezones de la incorporación de esta ciudad: antes de 1995 y a pesar de sus grandes donaciones tributarias, Aventura no recibía los servicios merecidos ni el control local ni una fuerza policíaca adecuada. Ahora todo eso ha cambiado para bien, dice el alcalde.

"En este contexto, pienso que más hispanos judíos y no judíos seguirán mudándose a Aventura. Se sentirán cómodos en esta ciudad exitosa y abierta", concluye. 

Mientras, Rojzman continuará proveyendo la "conexión latina" para la cual el ATJC lo sacó de su natal Argentina.

El pasado 5 de noviembre los votantes de la Florida aprobaron la Enmienda 11 a la Constitución de este estado. 

La enmienda, que ha puesto fin al Consejo de Fideicomiso local de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida, puede afectar a esta institución de forma negativa, ya que el control reside ahora en Tallahassee. 

	El gobernador Jeb Bush se deshizo del Consejo de Fideicomiso que estaba establecido en Tallahassee hace un año y medio y le pasó el control del presupuesto de las universidades a los consejos locales. De esta forma cada universidad en la Florida decidiría cómo iba a gastar su presupuesto. 

En el pasado, FIU, al igual que otras universidades del estado, había sufrido a causa de no tener un consejo local que entendiera las necesidades de sus estudiantes. Por eso, el gobernador tomó la decisión de deshacerse del sistema antiguo.

	El senador Bob Graham propuso la Enmienda 11 a la Constitución porque consideró que los fideicomisos locales malgastaban el presupuesto y que, mediante un consejo central en Tallahassee, los gastos se controlarían con mayor eficiencia. 

Sin embargo, mientras que las universidades no tengan un consejo local al cual aportar información y experiencia, estas instituciones podrían encarar los mismos problemas que en el pasado. 

	Miriam López es fideicomisaria del consejo de FIU y está en contra de la Enmienda 11. Al preguntarle cuál va a ser el futuro de FIU, López dice: "Si el futuro va a ser igual que el pasado, me preocupo mucho por el futuro de FIU." 

López piensa que todavía es muy temprano para conocer los cambios. En efecto, la enmienda no ha sido aún interpretada por los abogados estatales y es difícil saber exactamente qué sucederá.

	A partir del 7 de enero de 2003, el Consejo de Fideicomiso de FIU se anulará. López ya no será fideicomisaria. Una nueva junta local será creada pero el poder se quedará en Tallahassee. 

Por lo tanto, los fideicomisarios no tendrán ningún poder y esto preocupa a López, quien dice que los puestos de la nueva junta local no van a atraer a personas de la misma calidad que hasta ahora. 

Pero el doctor Mark Rosenberg espera que esto no sea cierto. El se desempeña como rector y vice presidente ejecutivo de Asuntos Académicos de FIU.

A su juicio, en el futuro, FIU tendrá fideicomisarios tan buenos como los que ha tenido hasta ahora. Sin embargo, reconoce que cabe la posibilidad de que esto no sea así y que es demasiado pronto para saber cuáles serán los efectos de la enmienda. Lo que más le preocupa a Rosenberg es cómo van a gobernar. 

Graham quiso implementar esta enmienda para ahorrar dinero pero, Rosenberg opina que sus motivos son otros. 

"Lo que de verdad le preocupa al senador no son los gastos sino el problema entre las universidades urbanas y rurales. Por ejemplo, Florida State University estaba perdiendo beneficios comparada con universidades urbanas como FIU. Esta es la verdadera motivación del senador", dice Rosenberg.

López dice que desea seguir ayudando a FIU, aunque ya no como fideicomisaria, porque piensa que es una excelente universidad con estudiantes excepcionales, pero piensa que este cambio no será positivo. 

Rosenberg quiere llevarlo paso a paso y ver "cómo evolucionan las cosas". A corto plazo, dice Rosenberg, nada va a cambiar pero FIU tardará entre cinco y siete años para experimentar los beneficios de este nuevo plan.

Con retrasos y sin una de las bandas invitadas, se efectuó el 4th Annual Latin Rock Explosion Concert en Biscayne Bay Campus, el pasado 14 de noviembre. 

La velada, a la que llegaron los amantes del rock en español, comenzó con la participación de la novel agrupación Toque de Keda. Los cinco jóvenes rompieron el hielo con su fusión de ritmos caribeños y rock. Entre su propuesta musical se encuentran las canciones "Lamento boliviano", popularizada por el grupo Los Enanitos Verdes, en tiempo de bachata y la popular balada "Te extraño, te olvido, te amo" del cantante puertorriqueño Ricky Martin. 

Luego de enfrentarse a la dura prueba de abrir un espectáculo para el público estudiantil y superar los problemas con el sonido, Toque de Keda demostró que tiene los elementos necesarios para sobresalir entre los nuevos grupos de rock que se desarrollan en Miami. El concierto continuó con la presentación de la banda brasileña Prato Principal, quienes interpretaron cinco temas, siendo el más aplaudido "Inmigración". 

Acto seguido llegaron Los Hidalgo al escenario del Wolfe University Center Ballroom. Recibid
