Subheadline: Taking a look back at 2002's most memorable moments
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
It was the year of unexpected champions. The year of parity. And the year of the extremely strange.

From game 7's to Olympic scandals, the year provided a showcase for the different extremes where sports can take fans. 

As we begin 2003, here's a look at the most memorable events of 2002, with a small bias towards the local sports scene. 

Pats win Super Bowl

They started last season 1-3, including an opening day loss at yearly doormat Cincinnati and ended their campaign with a win in the 2002 Super Bowl. Adam Vinatieri ended one of the most tightly contested super bowls of all time with a 48-yard field goal as time expired.

The Super Bowl win almost seemed anti-climatic following the Patriots AFC Divisional playoff game at Oakland on the controversial "tuck" call.

Baseball survives for now

Major League Baseball survived a potential players' strike that many were calling a possible death sentence for the sport. Players and owners reached an agreement which, in theory, will keep baseball away from labor problems for the next decade.

The agreement came during a year that showcased all of baseball's biggest problems, including the admission of steroid use among players. Only one month earlier, Commissioner Bud Selig ended the sport's biggest showcase, the All-Star game, in a tie, outraging fans and drawing further criticism to his already maligned term as the head of baseball.

Fins collapse again

This year was supposed to be the year that the Dolphins reversed the trend of late-season collapses. With Ricky Williams aboard for the ride, how could it not? Then Miami's greatest moment turned into the season's worst. Soon after Olindo Mare connected on a 57-yard field gold to give the Dolphins a road win over Denver and a 5-1 record, Miami realized that it would be without starting quarterback Jay Fiedler for almost two months. 

After going 2-4 without Fiedler, Miami seemed to re-position itself late in the season, before falling to Minnesota and New England. The last game featured a blown 11-point lead over the final five minutes and ended with a Vinatieri field goal in overtime.

Hurricanes' winning streak

The Miami Hurricanes started 2002 with a National Championship and ended the year on a 34-game winning streak. The streak ended on Friday, but remains impressive nonetheless. Winning 34 straight games in any sport during the era of parity is about as difficult as convincing people in other parts of the country that Florida is a normal place. Add the fact that Miami had to replace five first round picks prior to this season and made a coaching change during the period and you have one of the greatest streaks in the history of sports.

Winter mess

The United States welcomed the world for the 2002 Winter Olympics and put on quite a show. The games began with a focus on security, but attention quickly shifted to scandal and freak happenings. Rumors of scandal caused officials to hand out two sets of gold medals for the pairs figure skating competition. From the "Only in America" category, reports surfaced that a Russian mafia member tried to impress figure skater Elena Berezhnaya by bribing one of the competition's judges. Sara Hughes, the second youngest U.S. Olympian, winning the gold medal in the singles competition and the tripping incident in the speed skating event added to the drama.

Please seek counsel-ling

William Ligue Jr. and his son attended a Royals-White Sox game, but Ligue wanted more from the father-son activity. The father, who admitted to being on five different drugs at the time, encouraged his son to help him storm the field and attack Royals first base coach Tom Gamboa.

Reports say that Ligue encouraged his son with a pre-attack pep-talk. "Are you a pussy? Do you have balls? Are you my son? Would you do anything for me?" Ligue asked the 15-year old boy.

Angels win the pennant

The Yankees didn't win it. Neither did Atlanta. And the large payroll Mets failed too.

When baseball closed up shop for the winter, the Anaheim Angels owned the sport. Anaheim entered the season with a payroll of $62 million, 15th highest in baseball, and defeated the San Francisco Giants in seven games to win the World Championship. 

The most memorable moment of the series came when J.T. Snow saved Giants manager's Dusty Baker's son from being run over by David Bell. Three year old batboy Daren Baker sprinted on to the field to retrieve a bat after Snow scored, thinking the play was over. 

As Snow crossed the plate, he grabbed the child's jersey and lifted him by the shirt.

The women's basketball team (9-5, 0-1 Sun Belt) won seven of eight games in the month of December before dropping their last two contests in the new  year.

FIU won both tournaments they participated in in December.

The Golden Panthers traveled to Stony Brook, NY, easily defeating Bradley and host Stony Brook by a combined margin of 68 points.
The Golden Panthers won their own Fun & Sun Classic knocking off Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Mississippi.

The team also defeated cross-town rival Miami on Dec. 14 at Golden Panther Arena. The victory was the third consecutive win over the Hurricanes.

FIU went on the road to face three teams in the state of North Carolina. The Golden Panthers defeated Charlotte before falling to top-ranked Duke in Durham. The Golden Panthers were no match for the Blue Devils falling 106-58. FIU managed to win its final game of the road trip as they defeated UNC-Greensboro 71-64.

The Golden Panthers have since dropped two consecutive games: one to Siena at home and another at North Texas. The loss to the Lady Eagles was the first loss of the year  in Sun Belt Conference play for the season.
Senior Mandy Shafer leads the team in scoring with a 15.4 points per game average. Shafer was honored as Sun Belt Conference Player of the Week on Dec. 30 after scoring 30 points and grabbing four rebounds against the Rebels of Ole Miss.

Cormisha Cotton leads FIU with 8.6 rebounds per outing while Ivelina Vrancheva posts a 7.5 assists per game average.

After beginning the season undefeated at 4-0, the Golden Panther men's basketball team faced the toughest portion of their 2002-03 schedule and subsequently lost six consecutive games.

The streak began after FIU lost 77-63 to George Washington at home. The team then traveled to Southwest Missouri State University to take part in their tournament on Dec. 6 and 7. The Golden Panthers dropped both contests there and were then defeated by UMass, DePaul and Washington. 

FIU returned home to defeat Radford in the opening game of the FIU/Hampton Inn Classic but later lost to Duquesne in the title game. FIU defeated Canisius 57-54 on Jan. 2.

Junior Matias leads the team in scoring with a 13.1 average. Coach Donnie Marsh won his 100th game against Canisius.

Headline: Affirmative Action Purely Liberal
Subheadline:  
Author: thedrdrew@netzero.com
&nbsp;
Affirmative action is not needed. Equality is what is needed. It is simply disgusting and ridiculous today for Affirmative action to still be in existence. The new discrimination that people face today is the label of "minority" by liberals in order to create victims in society. Coming from one of those groups (I am Jewish) it disgusts me to no end that success is recognized by where I came from not what I have achieved. The true racism and discrimination that exists today is spoken and lived by liberals in this nation. The ever-living goal to make people dependent on Big government rather than themselves has been realized through pandering to people labelled as "minorities." For instance, a Black-American is already recognized as "underpriveleged" and forever deserving reparations from slavery and discrimination allowed by our federal government. Is this not disgusting to you? But the most digusting part about this is that many Black Americans allow themselves to be defined in this fashion--and some even believe that I who had nothing to do with slavery or other mistreatments, should pay. As long as Affirmative action is around people will not be recognized for who they are and what they have achieved--they will be recognized from where they come from and as belonging to a group. 

In the article" Affirmative Action still necessary" we are introduced to class envy and the discrimination that I was talking about.

"After studying student achievement for nearly three decades, he asserts that many black students are hindered by a culturally reinforced proclivity to underachieve academically for fear of being seen as "acting white.""

This is an example of what is called an inferiority complex--not a rationale for affirmative action--or the special treatment of individuals who come from a "minority" group.

A comment that the author made is actually true: "Grubman's episode also proves that we don't live in a pure meritocracy where performance is all that counts."

We live in a society that talks out of both sides of their mouths. On one hand we have a university that says they are equal opportunity but then says they are an "affirmative action institution." These are total opposites. Equal opportunity means you will not ask me what my cultural background is on the admissions application. Affirmative action means you will accept my application if it looks like too many individuals from a certain cultural background have been accepted. Affirmative action is pure discrimination and a ploy by liberals in this nation. It is a total lie to say you are for true equality but still recognize individuals based on where they come from rather than their personal achievements. This is today's discrimination on race and culture.

Headline: Cloning claims appear to be hoax
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Forget the implications of human cloning. Never mind the consequences of playing God. Nothing is scarier than the Raelians.

According to the group, or cult, depending on your perspective, humans are the products of extraterrestrial genetic engineering.

French journalist Claude Vorilhon, the self-proclaimed "prophet" who heads the group, claims to have met space aliens on a visit to a French volcano. Through those little green men, Vorilhon, who assumed the name Rael, learned that the "Elohim," an ancient alien civilization, created the human race.

Clonaid, a private company operated by Raelian bishop Dr. Brigitte Boisselier, was founded to advance the Raelian objective of eternal life through cloning.

Cloning is the key to give us eternal life and to cure all disease on Earth, but eternal life is the ultimate goal. This is just the first step," Rael explained in a CNN interview. "By step two, when we will discover accelerated-growth process, in a few hours, you can have an adult clone of yourself, which is still not you. And by downloading, uploading, transferring all the data in your brain, which make you who you are in this new cloned body, you can continue to be alive after death. That's the goal."

According to Rael, "...there is absolutely no link between [Clonaid] and the Raelian movement." This despite the fact that the company was founded three years before Boisselier assumed control as CEO in 2000, and despite the fact that even Boisselier has often referred to Rael as the company's "founder."  

The group claims that it presently has a list of 2,000 people willing to pay its $200,000 fee to have a clone made.

In late December, the group had claimed the birth of the first human clone to a 31-year-old American woman. Facing skepticism from the scientific community, Boisselier had agreed to allow an independent group, organized by former ABC News science editor and freelance science journalist Michael Guillen, to perform tests that would confirm the veracity of the claim. 

Indeed there was much room for skepticism. A group that had never cloned any living organism, headed by a biologist with no background in cloning, was now claiming that they had found the key, or in its "founder"'s words, "the trick," to doing what no other group - and there were many trying - had been able to do: clone a human being. They had prepared no prior evidence, nor published any scientific information as to what this "trick" was. They had simply made the claim, undocumented, unsupported and unexpected.

If something didn't seem right about the claim, or how the organization was handling itself then, things seem even stranger now. 

According to New York Times reports, Guillen had been trying to sell exclusive coverage of cloning news as long ago as May, even pitching it as a reality-based show that would follow a couple giving birth to a clone, and seeking as much as $100,000 for the idea. Not so independent after all.

Shortly after the birth announcement, Bernard Siegel, a Florida attorney filed a lawsuit in Broward County that calls for a court-appointed guardian taking custody of the child, alleging that Clonaid is exploiting the alleged clone. Siegel claims that he is simply "...trying to help a child," but the national attention he's receiving doesn't come as an unexpected side effect, I'm sure. 

Citing this lawsuit, Rael, via satellite on CNN's "Crossfire," urged Boisselier to renege on the DNA testing to be conducted that would prove the child a clone. He said that a "judge in Florida signed a paper saying that the baby, Eve, should be taken from the family, from her mother." In fact, a judge has yet to even look at the case that is not set for hearing until Jan. 22. When asked whether he had gotten away with a publicity stunt, Rael claimed his earpiece was malfunctioning.

"I am so sorry, but the sound is so bad. I cannot hear anything," he said. Right. How convenient. Perhaps too convenient an escape to a potentially disastrous situation.

There isn't much that seems right about the whole thing. It stinks throughout. And now it seems even more likely that the fiasco is precisely what many had feared it was: a publicity stunt aimed at drawing more members to this bizarre cult, and possibly more potential clone-seekers with $200,000 in hand. This is the kind of publicity that can't be paid for in cash. The only way to buy this kind of publicity is to trade credibility and integrity, a transaction that everyone, it seems, involved with this cloning circus has gladly made.

Hmmm, Circus? Did I mention that the Raelians also run UFOLand, a theme park in Canada? How fitting...

Headline: In Our View: Bush needs to focus on North Korean threat
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told the press Monday that inspectors in Iraq have yet to find any evidence of weapons of mass destruction even though inspections are still in the early stages.

That same day, the IAEA passed a resolution that condemns North Korea for violating international non-proliferation obligations and urged North Korea's top officials to comply with these obligations. 

The resolution "deplores in the strongest terms North Korea's unilateral acts to impede the functioning of containment and surveillance equipment at its nuclear facilities and the nuclear material contained therein." Surprisingly enough, Cuba and Iran are members of the 35 nations that make up IAEA.

ElBaradei told CNN that North Korea will get one more chance to comply. He added that if they fail to comply, the matter would be placed in the hands of the (U.N.) Security Council, which could call for heavier sanctions and even U.N. backed military force.

But the United States remains considerably blasé about the situation. Even though North Korea poses more of a danger, the Bush administration still remains obsessed with the situation in Iraq and has failed to really explore the North Korean threat. 

In a press conference, Bush said, "we have no intention of invading North Korea. I believe this will be resolved peacefully, and I believe it can be resolved diplomatically."

So why can't we resolve our problems with Iraq the same way? What fuels this persecution of Iraq when North Korea blatantly shows total disregard for inspections and rules? North Korea should be under the same kind of scrutiny that Iraq has undergone in recent months.

Headline: Affirmative Action still necessary
Author: Jim Mitchell / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
If you think affirmative action polices don't have a place in higher education, consider John Ogbu and Jack Grubman.

John Ogbu is a noted anthropology professor at the University of California at Berkeley; Jack Grubman is the discredited Wall Street analyst who hyped stocks in an effort to get his child into an exclusive New York City preschool.

Think out of the box for a moment, and you will understand that their stories illustrate volumes about failed expectations and connections. And they illustrate why affirmative action isn't passe. 

In his new book, Ogbu argues that black children are their own worst enemies in the classroom. After studying student achievement for nearly three decades, he asserts that many black students are hindered by a culturally reinforced proclivity to underachieve academically for fear of being seen as "acting white." As he told the New York Times, "There are two parts of the problem, society and schools on one hand and the black community on the other hand." 

To a point, he is right.

Minority kids who think that getting an education is a repudiation of a cultural heritage have got it all wrong. And there is blame to go around, from black parents who aren't involved in their children's lives and don't instill in their souls the importance of learning, to teachers and public school systems that don't hold kids to standards of excellence. 

But Grubman's story illustrates why bootstrapping alone isn't sufficient. Money, influence and opportunity play roles in where we end up. Grubman tapped access to power to seek a place for his child in a preschool that New Yorkers see as a gateway to an elite college. As bizarre as that sounds, it certainly isn't unimaginable that he would pull similar strings for college admission or ask for the full measure of his child's resume to be considered if the child's grades didn't measure up. 

Grubman's episode also proves that we don't live in a pure meritocracy where performance is all that counts. Grades are part of the admissions equation. So are references and admissions essays. But there are other dirty little admissions secrets: whether mommy or daddy attended the university; ties to major donors; and, of course, a variety of nonacademic qualifications such as musical, artistic or even athletic talent. 

College admissions, like hiring decisions in the real world, are subjective, in part because qualifications are in the eye of the beholder. 

Now that the Supreme Court has agreed to take up the affirmative action issue for the first time in nearly three decades, let's hope the court understands it isn't issuing a ruling in a vacuum. We live in a world with real economic gaps and real injustice. The court's role is in part to recognize injustices of opportunity and make them right in the least obtrusive way. 

In the Bakke case from California in 1978, the high court concluded that set racial quotas were wrong but that race could be used as one of many admissions criteria. More recently, the Hopwood case concluded that race couldn't be a factor in admissions to the University of Texas Law School.

The high court can't be expected to light a fire under academically lax parents, students and teachers. But it should use the University of Michigan case to affirm race as one of several legitimate admissions considerations. The court must preserve the opportunities for qualified minority candidates to compete and achieve both inside and outside of ivy-draped walls.

Affirmative action isn't about grossly compromising standards to promote the touchy-feely warmth of an ethnically diverse campus. Frankly, the choices are between A and B students, not C and D applicants.

Affirmative action guarantees that institutions leave ajar the educational doors that lead to workplace success later in life.

That isn't an activist position; that is a responsible one.

Headline: Perception of Christmas changes with age
Author: Lisa Cawley, Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
When I was younger, Christmas had an air of magic about it.  On Christmas Eve, after leaving milk and cookies out for Santa, my brother and I would scurry into bed, climb under the covers and pretend to sleep.  We stayed awake as long as we could, whispering in the darkness: "Do you think Santa Claus is here yet?  "No, not yet; he comes after midnight."  We suspected every noise to be reindeer hoofs on the roof and took several trips to the bathroom in hopes of catching a glimpse of jolly, old St.Nick.  Inevitably, we fell asleep before we saw anything.

I stopped believing in Santa Claus when I was 10.  My then eight-year-old brother had decided that technology was more important than Santa.  He struck a bargain with my dad to forfeit his Santa presents for a Super Nintendo, but he needed me to commit to the deal as well, so he told me the truth.  I never thought it was a fair trade - my childhood for a video game console.  But he had already spoiled it, so I gave in.

Christmastime used to be my favorite time of year. I liked the lights, the carols, the idea of a white Christmas and a family gathered around a tree by a fireplace, sipping hot chocolate, watching the children gleefully discover their new toys.  I liked the idea that peace on earth and goodwill to men are possible.  I enjoyed the warmth of family and friends.  

But as I grew older, the blazing hearth became a flickering candle that I now struggle to keep lit.  Christmas has grown cold for me.

When I was 17, my mother was in the hospital two weeks before Christmas.  I dug the dust-covered boxes of decorations out of the garage one by one.  I meticulously adorned every inch of the house in red, green and gold.  On a table in a corner of the living room, I set up our porcelain Christmas village.  I wanted everything to be perfect when my mom came home from the hospital.  I hoped that all the decorations would put her in brighter spirits.  

But she never came home.

Less than a week later, she passed away.

Every time I heard "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" on the radio, I couldn't help but think of the irony.

Christmas is sold as a day for gift giving and spending time with loved ones.  It's supposed to be a package deal.  But what about those who have no money, or more importantly, no family?  For those people, Christmas is merely a reminder of the things that are missing in their lives.

I no longer egocentrically await Christmas morning so that I can open my gifts.

Now, I think of the homeless people, the lonely people, the forgotten people.  I think of the single mother working overtime to buy presents for her children.  The last thing she wants is to see disappointment in their eyes on Christmas morning when they notice that there is nothing under the tree.   

I think of the elderly man greeting people at Wal-Mart on Christmas Eve because his monthly social security check is not enough to cover his wife's medication.  

Unlike Santa Claus, these people are real.

Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU sophomore Taurance Johnson has not played since the men's basketball team's Dec. 18 contest at DePaul due to a missing grade, head coach Donnie Marsh said.

"Taurance is missing a grade," he said. "University policy is not to allow a student-athlete to dress when this is the case."

Marsh refused to comment further citing the Buckley Amendment which protects student athletes with academic issues.

Marsh did say that the situation should be cleared up soon once the professor returns to school.

This is the latest setback for Johnson this season. The Williamsport, PA native was not allowed to play until FIU's Dec. 14 game against UMASS due to what Marsh believed was a subpar academic showing.

Prior to the beginning of the season Marsh told The Beacon that "in order to better assist [Johnson], I thought it was important to help him re-focus on what it takes to be a good college student."

Johnson, a 6'9 230-pound forward from Philadelphia Christian High School, was FIU's leading scorer (14.7), led the team in rebounds (6.1) and had the most blocked shots (55) on the team in 2001-02.

Johnson was ranked as one of the top non-power conference recruits by Prepstars.com coming out of high school. He was listed as the 39th top prospect in the nation by Oettinger's Top 100 Rising Seniors.

Headline: Students bring Israeli, Palestinian debate to colleges
Author: James M. O'Neill / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
PHILADELPHIA - Fueled by family ties to the Middle East and personal trips to the region, college students with pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian leanings have brought debate over the contentious Middle East conflict to university greens across the country.

Students who support the Palestinians have used political street theater, creating mock Israeli checkpoints at Pennsylvania State University and the University of Pennsylvania.

Mimicking the 1980s divestment movement against South African apartheid, the pro-Palestinians have also called on universities to divest of stock in companies that sell military supplies to Israel.

Students who support Israel have countered by invigorating campus Jewish groups, holding lectures to promote Israel's perspective on the Middle East conflict, and attacking the divestment drive as anti-Semitic.

Students are not the only ones lunging into the fray. College presidents are now speaking out against what many call increased anti-Semitism on campuses. A Philadelphia-based Web site called Campus Watch, meanwhile, lists faculty members who the site's backers contend teach an anti-Israeli perspective on the Middle East.

Nomi Deutch, a Penn State sophomore from Glenside, Pa., has been to Israel 15 times. She recently rallied pro-Israeli students on campus to counter what she viewed as growing anti-Semitism. "There was no active pro-Israeli political base here," she said.

So, with financial help from Hillel, a Jewish student-life group, she and others formed the Israel Action Committee, brought in speakers, started a pro-Israeli petition drive, and built an electronic mailing list of 300 students.

Although her father grew up in Israel and fought with the Israeli army, Deutch says he doesn't understand why she expends such energy over the debate.

"But the students we reach on campus could be the next congressmen, the next ambassadors, future heads of corporations," Deutch said. "Their experiences on campus will help shape their view of the world."

On that point, at least, pro-Palestinian students agree. That's why they began organizing in the first place.

Uri Horesch, a University of Pennsylvania graduate student who grew up in Israel and served in the Israeli army, speaks against Israel's policies in the occupied territories. "Most Israelis stand by, doing nothing," he said, "or complain about their own situation: Because of the suicide bombings, they can't go out to dinner.

"I sympathize -- but that's not the only concern," Horesch said. "We see a lot of pro-Israel stuff on campus done blindly. We know what's going on there and can't just let that go. Israel has the means to protect itself, and, unfortunately, it does more than protect itself."

Headline: Condom dispensers now in student center, dorms
Author: Christina Kent / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A pack of condoms at a drugstore costs between $5 and $20. 
However, condoms recently made available in your university bathroom cost only 50 cents.

As a show of support for World Aids Day (Dec. 1) and as a part of the Health Care and Wellness Center's ongoing efforts to raise AIDS awareness and provide protection options on campus, eight $135 condom dispensers have been installed university-wide. 

The dispensers, filled with special "vin pack" condoms that will not get punctured or damaged while vending, have been placed in men's and women's bathrooms in housing and student life locations. The Student Government Association purchased the dispensers after a resolution was adopted in October 2001 with support from then-president Victor Romano.

"It's a good project because it helps safe sex be accessible to all people on campus," Jacqueline Sosa, SGC Lower Division representative, said. 

When used correctly, condoms are the best way to prevent pregnancy, the spread of HIV during sexual activity and reduce the risk of spreading other sexually transmitted diseases. 

One in four college students will develop an STD, Wellness Coordinator Mariela Gabaroni said. Moreover, Miami is one of the top five U.S. cities in terms of infection rate, Gabaroni said.

"It's reality," Melanie Monje,  international business major, said. "It puts up another red flag to remind you."

AIDS awareness and sexual responsibility is one of the HWC's top priorities: it has organized World AIDS Day walks, resource fairs and informational visits to First Year Experience classes, it prints "Random Acts of Wellness" prevention handouts and both campuses supply free condoms.

"This is mainly being done as a convenience for students," Gabaroni said. "A lot of people think it's a long walk to the Wellness Center. We want them to have another avenue."

So far students seem to relish this new accessibility.

"I liked the idea [of the dispensers] because condoms would be available to a wider range of people more hours of the day," said Oscar Loynaz, HWC assistant director. "This makes materials we provide at the Wellness Center more available around campus. For example, students taking night classes come to school during a time when the Wellness Centers are closed."

Gracie's Grill and other campus hangout spots often have highly social events, where people may "hook up," and the dispensers are only a short walk away in the nearest dispenser-equipped bathroom, said Loynaz, who has actively worked in the field of AIDS prevention and awareness for 11 years.

"I think it's a good idea," Esteban Ortega, a graduate student, commented. "You never know when you might need one."

There are some possible drawbacks to the condom dispensers.

"A main concern is that they may be vandalized," Kyle Salomon, a Wellness assistant who was instrumental in the purchasing of the machines, said of the shiny, vertical metal boxes. "I pretty much see that they are hard to take apart, but it was my understanding that the female's tampon machines had been previously vandalized."

Loynaz expressed the same concern, yet is still hopeful about the overall outcome.

Carlos Carrasco, assistant director for the Graham Center, helped install the dispensers and is worried the boxes may only provoke complaints from students if they are not refilled on a regular basis. Gabaroni said the boxes will be refilled about every two weeks and Salomon said there will be a contact number on the boxes for people to call if they need to be restocked. Proceeds from condom dispenser purchases will go toward the cost of restocking. HWC will not make a profit.

For now, one dispenser is located in both the male and female bathrooms of UP's Panther Hall and GC as well as BBC's Bay Vista Apartments and Wolfe University Center. In the future, the Wellness Center would consider putting in more dispensers if these "pilots" work out smoothly, Gabaroni said.

"SGA supports students in maintaining healthy lifestyles and this is just another way to do that," Sosa said.

"You don't know where the bullet lies in the chamber," Gabaroni said of those who don't want to take advantage of campus resources. "You're either lucky or you're not."

Headline: Top Ten Albums
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;

The Eminem Show 
With his third album, Eminem dodges most of that annoying controversy that followed past releases. The Eminem Show takes Eminem's usual shock tactics and adds depth and dimension as far as song style and lyrical content go.  It boils down to the maturity and evolution of Marshall Mathers' Eminem persona, which makes for one of this year's best rap releases.
	
Weezer, Maladroit
Maladroit is a product of Weezer's peak. Like Eminem, Weezer doesn't really offer anything all that new, but essentially turns up the rock quotient from the last album, making it more of a sequel than a totally new entity. Singer Rivers Cuomo continues to create exceptionally strong songs and the rest of the group's abilities are sharper than any other living rock band.	

Get Up Kids, On a Wire
Indie-rock favorites, the Get Up Kids, did an enormous amount of touring after 1999's Something To Write Home About. Touring for almost three years straight can bore an artist to death, a possible explanation for their startlingly different On a Wire, which unfortunately wasn't as well received as their last album. But the album is genius indeed and the Get Up Kids really do strive to break a new mold.
	
The Strokes, Is This It
Although the Strokes' album was technically released in 2001, everyone will remember its incredible impact on the world of music in 2002. Is This It is a return to real rock and roll and New York City punk bands. The followers abounded: The White Stripes, The Vines, the Hives.  The Strokes do it better though, and have left a deep mark that won't be forgotten.

Sigur Ros, ()
If you saw "Vanilla Sky," you've probably heard the music of Sigur Rós. The band is quickly gaining recognition underground and in the college music scene with its new album, simply entitled (). Usually compared to Radiohead, Sigur Rós is actually quite unique and worth listening to if you have the time and patience. Don't expect to be shocked or rocked, but I can guarantee auditory pleasure.

Turn on the Bright Lights
Interpol's debut album, Turn on the Bright Lights, takes a look back at bands like Joy Division and Fugazi, creating really nice blends of penetrating and softly driving harmonies with a sound vocal touch. It's a brilliant and enchanting album and with some warming up to, becomes one of the best semi-unknown albums of last year.

Coldplay, A Rush of Blood to the Head
This record captures the essence of  Coldplay. It isn't exactly some style of music one can define; keep in mind bands like The Smiths or Echo and the Bunnymen, when listening to Coldplay. A Rush of Blood to the Head is nothing short of excellent.

Red Hot Chili Peppers, By the Way
The Red Hot Chili Peppers' eighth studio album has found its way into the hearts of music lovers everywhere. This album has everything: Anthony Kiedis' hard hitting inferno lyrics, Flea's amazing bass lines, pulse pounding harmonies and funky grooves.  What really makes By the Way special is its exploration of new musical styles and more diversity in song structure. This album is one of their greatest triumphs to date.
	
Foo Fighters, Songs for the Deaf
Finally, Queens of the Stone Age get some recognition. We have to ask ourselves though, is it because their new album Songs for the Deaf is so damn good, or is it because Foo Fighters' front man and ex-Nirvana drummer, Dave Grohl joined the band? It doesn't really matter. Through this album, one hears how much this band has to offer. Could this be the greatest rock and roll album since Nevermind?  It comes quite close.

Ben Folds Live
My favorite album of the year follows my favorite concert event as well: Piano god Ben Folds' live album, Ben Folds Live.  One would be surprised at how awesome this guy sounds with just a piano, even when playing old Ben Folds Five songs which usually call for an entire band. Folds enlists the audience as backup singers and even teaches them how to hum the horn parts on "Army." The songs don't really need much else, as Folds' sleek piano technique, witty lyrics and beautiful voice fills your stereo just as it did in the concert hall. Don't be afraid of the lack of band: He's all the band you need.

Headline: Top Ten Moments in Music
Author: Alfred Soto / Editorial Advisor
&nbsp;

To those of you looking for "serious" rock and roll, please stop looking. It's out there, in the fringes, prophesizing. 
It was a stunning year for pop music - a rebuke to those music-hounds who, seeking solace in any radio station not affiliated with Clear Channel, ran to bands like Interpol or the Flaming Lips, or, worse, actually made The Vines and The Hives saviors of rock and roll. 
In truth, none of those bands seemed to matter as much as Missy Elliott, (whose "Work It" actually did the impossible and topped "Get Ur Freak On"); or Pink, who unleashed single after single from last year's Mizzunderstood, peaking with the glorious rush of "Don't Let Me Get Me."
What music fans wanted was "meaning" in rock music (let's not even say "pop," a bad word). Critics wore out copies of Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and Beck's Sea Change trying to convince themselves these albums were masterpieces, when in truth Wilco's record represents what happens when a savvy public-relations campaign pushes a collection of incoherent folk songs complete with electronic whatchamacallits into the Top 40, while Beck's album was just a snooze - proof that when the little guy plays at being "sincere," he's merely boring, his talent disappearing up his own ass. 
You want great albums? Sleater Kinney's One Beat, DJ Shadow's The Private Press and The Mekons' Oooh! are out there; go pick'em up. Grizzled veterans like Elvis Costello and David Bowie released their best records since the Reagan Administration and were promptly rewarded with Top 20 debuts. 
Here are some of 2002's most memorable musical moments:

Eminem, "Lose Yourself."
 Except for a few tunes demonstrating how supple and versatile a producer Mr. Slim Shady has become, The Eminem Show was a dud, excellent when listened to out of context, redundant when set against The Marshall Mathers LP and its own unkept promises. But then this track came on the radio and made all criticism moot. 
Possibly his single greatest song, Marshall Mathers bores deep into his Eminem persona, predicting how tired his act will seem five years down the road and how this act risks alienating him from his art, his beloved daughter and finally Marshall Mathers himself. Just because he loses himself in the music doesn't mean he's sure he'll come out the other side. 

Justin Timberlake, "Like I Love You."
Yes, alright, fine, I agree - he's trying too hard to channel the spirit of Off The Wall-era Michael Jackson. I'll forget the silly hat and moondancing if you can just please listen to how Justin coos, growls, whispers and shimmies around the freshest backing track the Neptunes have ever assembled. You say you're tired of airhead boy bands? I'd like to see Beck or the Hives come up with an acoustic guitar riff this yummy. Okay, Justin's got a "paint thinner falsetto," to quote sage Greil Marcus, but I give him credit for aspiring to emotion. Sometimes a simulation delivers as well as the real thing. 

The Mekons, Oooh! (Out of Our Heads)
Forget the vastly overrated Wilco: the grizzled British punk band delivered the year's best alternative/country hybrid, mixing corrugated guitar riffs, a scratchy fiddle and boozy singing into the most stinging rebuke of contemporary politics yet released. It's impossible to listen to this record without keeping the pardoning of Marc Rich, September 11, Enron or Trent Lott in mind; the Mekons perform for a world where the only thing that matters is how and where you are born and how you conceal it. So what keeps us going? Throwing another log on the fire while dancing and drinking  naked, that's how. 

Bryan Ferry, Frantic
At first the title smacked more of desperation than truth; when was the last time anything about Bryan Ferry was energetic, let alone frantic? A casual glance at the credits didn't help. Three co-writes with David Stewart? Covering not one, but two, overperformed Dylan songs? Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood on a song titled "Hiroshima"? 
Turns out Frantic is the most vital album Ferry's made since Roxy Music dissolved in 1983. If Frantic seems an uneven hodgepodge, Ferry's love of twentieth-century music unifies it, a love that puts Leadbelly, young upstart Greenwood and, yes, Dylan at the service of his muse. There was no greater emotional one-two punch this year than putting his cover of "One Way Love" next to the feathery Brian Eno collaboration "I Thought."

DJ Shadow, The Private Press.
Very private. A funhouse where mirror upon mirror reflected shards of spaghetti-western scores, obscure British soul groups, pseudo-New Order sequencers, anchored and propelled by drum tracks as subliminal and inexorable as a heartbeat. How can this album matter as much as 1996's world-historic Endtroducing...? It doesn't. So? Play The Private Press in 2013 and it will still unsettle you when the one-a.m. blues creep in.

Headline: "Chicago" energizes musical genre
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
      I like musicals. Why shouldn't I? I like movies and I like music, so movie musicals kill the proverbial two birds with the proverbial one stone. Still, I vividly remember sitting in the audience when Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge" first came out, and noticing a general wave of ill-will towards the flick. People were simply not liking it, snickering uneasily at all the wrong parts and walking out en masse. Seemed like audiences just weren't ready for the much-prophesied second coming of the musical. 

Naturally I was wary of director Rob Marshall's adaptation of the Broadway classic "Chicago," because I figure the movie musical coffin has been nailed more times than Jenna Jameson. The surprising news is not that I liked this movie a lot, but rather that pretty much everyone else did as well.

"Chicago" has a deceptively simple plot: Girl kills boy, girls gets sent to prison, girl tries to tap dance her way out of prison into showbiz because anyone can get away with murder as long as they look the right way and have the right lawyer. The flimsy premise hangs over the movie like lingerie: the less there is of it, the better things get. Ultimately "Chicago" is about the music, the dancing and the energetic way in which the camera's and actors' movements have been synchronized.

Roxie Hart (played by Renee Zellwegger) kills her lover and unsuccessfully tries to peg the crime on her husband Amos ( John C. Reilly). While in prison, she meets the glamorous Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has done some fashionable murdering of her own and is playing her notoriety for all it's worth. Guided by the prison warden, Mama Horton (Queen Latifah), Roxie tries to emulate Velma, and hires renowned lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) to get her both out of prison and into the papers. 

Renee Zellwegger seems like the last girl in Hollywood that should be playing a cold-blooded murderer, but she pulls it off effortlessly, turning Roxie into the most adorable, inoffensive psychopath since Chucky. She's just a girl with a dream, and if murder gets her into show-business, so what? It beats being a waitress. It is in her musical numbers that she shines. Her sultriness comes as a genuine revelation, and while her vocal range might be somewhat limited, she is so in command of her singing that one wonders why she doesn't put out a record of her own.

Catherine Zeta-Jones may not quite startle as Velma, and her role has been considerably cut down from the Broadway show, but she moves energetically through her flapper routines, and it is thanks to her that "All That Jazz" becomes one of the most electrifying musical numbers ever committed to celluloid.

The real surprise in this movie, though, comes from a singing, dancing Richard Gere, who does his best screen work since, hell, I don't know, ever? Gere has his own school of dull, self-enamored acting going on, but he plays that to his advantage in numbers like "Razzle Dazzle" and the absolutely hilarious "They Both Reached for the Gun," a puppet show that will leave you reeling in your seat.

"Chicago" flashes us into thinking it's dealing with bigger things than it really is, but who cares? There hasn't been such undiluted fun on the screen in ages. It's like watching a fist triumphantly break through the wooden lid of that ominous movie-musical coffin.

Headline: Top Ten Movies
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
Adaptation 
Charlie Kaufman's feverishly post-modern script about Charlie Kaufman's feverishly post-modern script is more than a cinematic trick; "Adaptation" is able to move beyond all accusations of gimmickry thanks to its mature inquiry into what passion is and the ways it can create and destroy us. And yes, Nicholas Cage is finally getting some respect again.

Chicago
 Renee Zellwegger and Catherine Zeta-Jones sizzle in that most rare of Hollywood creatures: a fun, intelligent, energetic movie musical. The music is contagious, and the whimsical plot (about a woman who kills her lover and craftily manages to turn her crime into tabloid fodder) feels a lot more modern than the Prohibition-era setting would suggest.

Far From Heaven
Director Todd Haynes' rapturous revisiting of 1950s melodramas turns into one of the most original and daring movies of the year. Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid are simply astounding in two of their most powerful roles ever, but it is the sheer colorful beauty of Haynes' meticulous recreation that turns "Far From Heaven" into a sublime movie-going experience.

Gangs of New York
 After years of planning and delays, Martin Scorcese's dream project finally sees the light. The movie is simply a historical treat, the sporadically brilliant prequel to films like "Mean Streets" and "Goodfellas" but it is Daniel Day Lewis' showy performance as Bill the Butcher that ultimately makes this a great film.

Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
 That "The Two Towers" is just as good as "Fellowship of the Ring" should surprise no one; but that it is even better should. The second part in the trilogy builds up into one of the longest, most engaging battle scenes ever filmed, and it is this monumental battle of good versus evil that leaves us  desperately wishing for the next movie to come out.

Minority Report
 Steven Spielberg's look at life in a nearly crimeless future re-invigorates the future noir genre, while dishing more twists than a slinky.

The Ring
 The scariest movie on this list, "The Ring" is a remake of a hit Japanese horror flick centering on a mysterious video-tape and its deadly influence upon the watcher. It may not be most critics' idea of a great art film, but what do they know? "The Ring" becomes a visceral experience most artsy films wish they could replicate. 

Spiderman
Comic-books fans waited for a long time to see "Spiderman" on the big screen, and despite some misgivings, this movie turned out to be one of the most successful adaptations of a comic book ever, because it kept a firm balance between pleasing fans and treating the source with humor and a bit of irreverence. And who knew that Tobey Maguire could kick ass?

Spirited Away
 Hayao Miyazaki's tender tale of a girl's vacation among Japanese spirits is an animated treat for adults who will probably appreciate the movie's gentle pacing and its emotional punch more than kids could. This movie is more than eye-candy, though; it is a mature walk through a childhood dream.

Talk to Her
Pedro Almodovar's latest may not have his usual share of transvestites and manic humor. Still, the unforgettable relationship that evolves between two men who are guarding a woman's sick-bed makes "Talk to Her" a match for "All About My Mother," and some may say the movie's even  better than that.
