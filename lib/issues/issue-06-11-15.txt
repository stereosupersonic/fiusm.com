University athletics officials said Nov. 15 that head football coach Don Strock has submitted his resignation effective at season's end. 

Strock, who was the first head coach in FIU football history, will stay on for the final three games of the season.

"It's time to move on," Strock said in his weekly radio show on 1360 WKAT. "I've decided to go in a different direction."

Strock said he addressed the players and the assistant coaches before practice today. Strock made the announcement now to give the University ample time to find a replacement.

"I want what's best for the program," he said.

The announcement comes just four days before the football team hosts Louisiana-Lafayette in its Homecoming game. The team finishes the season with a Dec. 2 home game against Troy.

The football team, currently 0-9, is one of only two winless teams in Division I-A.
