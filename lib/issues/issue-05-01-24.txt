Headline: New steroid policy to strengthen MLB image
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When I first heard about Major League Baseball's new steroid policy, like most baseball fans, I thought, "Yes! No longer shall the game be tainted by speculations that its players are using performance-enhancing drugs!" 

The much-needed decision came after the media frenzy surrounding two of baseball's biggest stars-Jason Giambi of the New York Yankees and Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants- who admitted to a grand jury that they unknowingly took steroids that the Bay Area Lab Co-Operative (BALCO) laboratories provided them.

Many were surprised by the new policy, considering the widespread opinion that the Player's Union was protecting steroid users. 

In the old policy, players were tested once per season, and those who failed a test the first time would receive only drug treatment. A second positive test would result in a 15-game suspension. It wasn't until the fifth positive test that a player would face a one-year ban­­. All of this remained completely unseen to the public eye.

The problem with that policy is obvious; you have to be extremely idiotic in order to be caught once, much less five times.

 All you have to do is start shooting up after your test, and then begin to cycle down before the season begins. And even if you are dumb enough to get caught, your reputation would remain intact because the public would not find out.

Eventually, players began to speak out to the media, calling the old steroid policy a "joke." 

They knew baseball fans were losing trust in the game and didn't want a few rotten apples to spoil the bunch. 

Shockingly, the Player's Union, which is supposed to act in "the best interest of the players," actually did, and met with MLB officials to devise the new steroid policy.

In the new policy, players will be tested once a year and will receive an unlimited amount of random testing throughout the year. The penalties are also tougher with a first positive test resulting in a 10-day suspension. 

The second and third positive tests will result in a 30 and 60-day ban, respectively. 

Finally, the fourth positive test will result in a one-year ban from the game. All bans are without pay. Just to put the icing on the cake, all suspensions will be made public.

Granted, nothing is perfect, which is why many have criticized that the policy does not address amphetamines. 

Also known as greenies, amphetamines are central nervous system stimulants and supposedly have a long tradition in baseball. Minor league baseball, which historically has had a more stringent drug-testing policy, considers them to be  "drug[s] of abuse." 

What bothers me most about this is that the MLB holds its big-leaguers to a more lax standard than the up-and-coming players. Why not just have one all-encompassing policy? That would be the more logical choice. And speaking of logic, if you want to rid your sport of performance-enhancing drugs, shouldn't you make a policy to cover all performance-enhancers? I guess not. Baby steps MLB, baby steps.

After giving it much thought, I think the new steroid testing policy will ultimately make the game less fun. Well, for me at least. 

Not because there will be a lack of homeruns, but because I will no longer have the pre-game amusement of playing the game "Which Bench Warmer is Juicing Up to Crack the Starting Lineup," and my personal favorite, "Guess Whose Head Got Bigger Over the Off-season." 

Now I am going to have to spend the entire batting practice asking players for autographs, begging bat boys for stray baseballs and heckling the opposing team the way normal fans do. I guess it's a small price to pay for a cleaner game with fair competition.

Headline: Basketball in need of superstar shooter
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In present-day America, we live in a society that encourages and praises individuality and success. The same can be said on the basketball court. 

Watching the FIU men's basketball team this year has been a pleasure, a surprise and a heartache for fans. With the lack of a dominant everyday scorer, the team has fallen on hard times recently, and lost games that it otherwise may have won. 

The biggest thing the team needs is a consistent 20-25 point scorer every game. Incredibly enough, everything else is in place for this team to be successful. 

We live in a sports society that searches for leaders and superstars. One of the hardest things to find today is role players. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, FIU has those very crucial role players. 

Along with a consistent scorer comes more opportunity for role players. The perfect example is the player that plays like a superstar at the start of his career, but  falters once he leaves. At the moment, FIU is that player just waiting for the shooter or the superstar to bring out the best in it. 

Many of the problems that FIU men's basketball is experiencing this season radiate from this lack of a superstar. Constantly, FIU has played fantastic high-pressure, high-tempo defense, and consistently they have lost games by not being able to convert on the offensive side of the court.

More than anything, as one player best stated following a loss last week, too many mental mistakes are being made. Players are trying to do too much; they are all trying to be heroes. That is where the shooter or superstar comes in; the player who says, "Give me the ball," when the team trails by one with seconds to play; the player that says, "No matter what happens, I want that ball every time." 

Once FIU finds that man, the sky will be the limit. He could be on his way next season to the image of Johwen Villegas, a lights out three-point shooter, or Elvis Lora, a pure shooter at the point similar to ex-FIU player and current Utah Jazz guard, Carlos Arroyo. 

The foundations are set for this team  to step right in and make an impact. The role players are present this season, especially with newcomers Ivan Almonte and Ishmael N'Diaye. Both have stepped up their play in unusual scorer roles for the team's benefit. 

This team is looking at only graduating two starters, center Byron Burnett and guard Junior Matias. A promising future may be just around the corner for head coach Sergio Rouco, as freshmen Kenny Simms and junior Sheldon Bailey have stepped up their game. They have seen increasing court time so far this season. 

This team lacks experience in the conference, something that it is gaining by the truckload this season. So far these players have had a taste of what it is like to be on the losing side of the court. The remainder of this season will dictate if this pattern will continue. The role players are there. All they need now is a shooter. Hopefully, Rouco, a master recruiter, has already signed him.

Subheadline: Student finds bookstore deceptive and unfair
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
FIU students have enough worries with having to pay tuition. Many also have to pay rent and the expenses of living. 

The FIU bookstore just makes life harder. Classes require, at times, expensive books. Many  students expect their school to have sympathy. 

The FIU bookstore is run by thieves. 

My sister worked there and the bookstore takes used books from the students, giving them hardly any money, then packs them up and sells them as new, for a lot more. 

I was appalled when I was sold a book, had to pay new book prices and then inside the book found the markings and post-its of a previous owner. 

When I tried to return it to get the used price and save money, employees looked at me with guilty faces and didn't know what to do. They told me to return it for another new book, of which they had none in stock. I asked if I could get the difference between the new and old book back and they gave me a stern "no." 

The FIU bookstore should be ashamed, and they have to be exposed. I advise that if you want to buy books, go to Book Smart across the street from FIU. They are cheaper and always give a lot more money back on your used books.

Headline: Critics should forgive prince's public error
Author: Dara Bramson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There is rarely a costume nowadays that is original. Year after year, costume parties seem to repeat themselves. Girls typically boast revealing, cleavage-spilling nurse or cheerleader outfits. 

Guys usually wear their normal everyday outfits or will occasionally splurge $1.25 at Party City for the "Legalize It!" button that magically transforms them into a hippie.

I have never been invited to a Colonial-Native themed party. If I were to be, it is doubtful that I would be able to come up with a creative costume idea, at least not as creative as Prince Harry's. Prince Harry showed up at a friend's fancy Colonial-Native themed party wearing a casual beige outfit. 

He wore a bright, red swastika armband. Harry deserves some credit for being so original, but all joking aside, I do not think his originality is an excuse for being inappropriate. 

"Your 20s are the time to do stupid things and get them out of your system," said comedian Aaron Barschack, in an interview with BBC, who dressed up in an extravagant Osama bin Laden costume for Harry's 21st birthday. "Otherwise, you keep everything inside yourself and end up being arrested for gate crashing a royal party dressed as the world's most wanted terrorist, in your mid-30s."

It is a good thing this article will be read by mostly college students. We may be able to save ourselves  trauma in our 30s if we just take Barschak's advice.

Celebrities are constantly criticized for what they wear, such as being denigrated if their garb is seen last season. Having been in the media's eye his entire life, every move Harry makes has been scrutinized. 

Being the prince of a country that was a declared enemy of Nazi Germany during World War II, one would expect some modicum of sensitivity toward  those whose emotions are stirred at the sight of the swastika. 

It is hard to believe that Harry's faux pas was done maliciously or with any anti-Semitic intent. Prince Harry has also made his regrets and apology clear. Nevertheless, it is doubtful that he woke up the next morning, saw himself all over the news, and wondered why The Sun had a photo of him in his costume next to the big, bold letters HARRY THE NAZI. 

I try not to make assumptions, but sometimes it is inevitable. Prince Harry could have been trying to pull the number one spot on the next worst dressed countdown, and he may succeed. 

Regardless of his motivation, I must admit it is rather invigorating to write about a true member of the royal family rather than the pseudo-majestic Paris Hilton.

Prince Charles, Harry's father, demanded that both Harry and Harry's older brother, William, visit the Nazi death camp Auschwitz in Poland and watch "Schindler's List." 

Perhaps painting a clear picture and physically going to the site of some of the most horrific of the Nazi's actions will make it clear to Harry why his costume has caused so much controversy.

Ironically, it seems that even the people who presumably should be most offended by the incident are most willing to let it go. 

Dr. Jonathan Romain, rabbi of the Reform Synagogues of Great Britain said in an article found in a BBC publication, "The fact that the Palace has issued an apology indicated that this was a mistake by the prince. But having been given, the apology should now be accepted."

Maybe it is because I am a member of the Jewish faith, but I agree with Rabbi Romain. I agree with him at least until Harry does something else in the future worthy of media coverage that will inevitably dig up this incident once again. 

Now that the Prince Harry issue is closed for now, let us move on to more pressing issues ... like that ridiculous lion costume his brother wore.

Headline: Bush promotes spread of liberty for safety's sake
Author: Warren P. Strobel and Steven Thomma / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
President Bush proclaimed a bold, even revolutionary, foreign policy in his inaugural address last Thursday, but he offered no specifics about how he plans to rid the world of tyranny, which tyrants he'll target or what other foreign or domestic goals he might be willing to sacrifice to promote freedom.

Bush's declaration that "the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world" was reminiscent of predecessors from Woodrow Wilson to Ronald Reagan, and especially of John F. Kennedy's 1961 pledge to "pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty."

But while Wilson, Reagan and Kennedy argued that America should battle tyranny because doing so is right, Bush said America must battle tyranny because it can never be safe so long as tyrants rule.

"The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands," Bush said.

That effort to link the security of Americans in their homes to the promotion of liberty abroad reflects the profound effect that the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks had on Bush's and much of the nation's thinking.

So far, however, Bush's efforts to defeat tyranny have been confined largely to Afghanistan and Iraq, and to a lesser extent to Iran and Syria and to the communist regimes in Cuba and North Korea.

In many other countries where freedom is severely limited but where the United States gets energy, trade, counterterrorism cooperation or diplomatic help, the administration has done little. They include China, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Russia and Egypt. In others with less strategic or economic weight, for example Zimbabwe and Burma, the U.S. campaign against tyranny has been largely rhetorical.

In the wake of his speech, is the president now willing to pressure China and risk a trade war that could raise the cost of consumer goods for U.S. citizens and hurt the American economy? Will he pressure pro-American Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who took power in a coup and whose rule is fragile enough as it is?

"These are the countries that people are going to be watching - not the ones that are enemies anyway," said Jennifer Windsor, the executive director of Freedom House, a nonpartisan group that promotes democracy worldwide.

Freedom House lists 89 countries, with 44 percent of the world's population, as "free." It lists 54 countries as "partly free" and another 49 as "not free."

Last month, Freedom House put Russia, whose president, Vladimir Putin, has received nearly unconditional backing from Bush, in the "not free" category because of Putin's concentration of power and intimidation of the media and political opponents.

Bush did not specify what means he favors to spread democracy and defeat dictatorship, other than to say, "this is not primarily the task of arms." He touched only briefly on the deeply troubled U.S. effort to transform Iraq into a stable democracy, which so far has cost 1,360 American lives and $200 billion, and he never mentioned the country by name.

Tools other than warfare that the president could use include covert action to undermine oppressive governments, economic sanctions, or less confrontationally, foreign aid, persuasion and public diplomacy.

Bush follows a long line of presidents who've interpreted Puritan leader John Winthrop's 1630 idea of America as a "city upon a hill" to mean that the United States has a unique role to play in sharing liberty with the world. But Bush may be the first president to declare that the United States cannot be safe unless all others are free.

Headline: FIU says goodbye to Mr. Wonderful
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Walking into any of his classrooms at FIU or at Miami Dade College, James Albury would give his students a bright smile while greeting them with any number of random jokes.

"Good evening, ladies and jellybeans," he would say or "I stand before you now to stand behind you."

Returning from the break between the Fall and Spring semesters, many students expected to be greeted by another joke as they walked into his University Park office only to stare at his empty chair.

"We still get one or two students coming in looking for him with their textbooks and telling us, 'He said he'd help me with this quiz,'" said Patsy Self, director of the UP Reading Lab.

Albury, who had been working at the lab for the past nine years, passed away December 27, 2004, due to heart complications.

Since then, the faculty members, students and university staff who knew him have spent the month remembering the man known warmly as "Mr. Wonderful."

"He was an extremely kind man, the type of person who would return to the grocery store if someone gave him too much change," said Self.

Albury was an alumnus of FIU and recieved his Master's degree in reading education. He had been making plans to earn his doctorate in philosophy and was considering schools like FIU, the University of Miami and Florida State University.

Albury began his career as a reading lab instructor after taking a class with Self, who recommended him for the position, during his sophomore year. He taught advanced reading techniques, prepared students in memorizing material for their exams and taught developmental reading courses at Miami Dade College.

However, most remember him for the time he gave to athletes who needed to pass the Florida's reading exam and the high success rates of his students.

"He had an amazing track record with the state exam for athletes - all of them passed, so he was called 'Mr. Wonderful' by students in both schools," said Self.

In his memory, staff at the reading lab have set up a bank account at Washington Mutual in hopes of raising enough money to begin a scholarship for Kristy Leigh Albury, the professor's youngest daughter, who is just beginning college.

Cards requesting donations will be sent to faculty and students at both FIU and MDC; family friends have also pledged their assistance with the fund.

"[Albury's] family have been left alone now, and we thought it would be a good thing if we helped them out," said Self.

However, it is still not known if the scholarship will only be awarded to Albury's daughter or if it will be made available annually to different students.

"Right now, it appears to be a one time shot. We're playing it by ear. It'd be nice if we could start a foundation, but I think we need $50,000 for that," Self said. For now, the staff is focused on remembering Albury and his contribution to the university.

"He was a man who would not want students to give up," Self said. "He believed in them, and they always looked up to him."

Albury is survived by his wife, Janet, and four children: Deanna Albury Decario, Loraine Albury Newman, James P. Albury III and Kristy Leigh Albury. He had four grandchildren and was expecting a fifth.

Anyone interested in donating to the scholarship fund is asked to e-mail Patsy Self at selfp@fiu.edu.

&nbsp;
1. THE FIERY FURNACES, EP

The new collection comes from a band who quickly made several "best of" lists in 2004. This album (which actually isn't an EP) includes b-sides, rarities and remixes - lots of fun.

2. Coachella 2005 music festival

This year's California-based music festival is still in the works. As of now, the full line-up has not been released, but the dates have been set to April 30 and May 1. I'm sure if you went to last year's festival, like I did, you know all about the fun. I'll be booking my plane tickets this week. Visit www.coachella.com for more info.

3. "C.Q."

I recently saw this 2001 film by Roman Coppola and became smitten with the lead actress, Angela Lindvall. The film is quirky, but consumingly, cute and it makes several stylish nods to the French New Wave. Right on!

4. "CUT: FILM AS FOUND OBJECTS"

This is a small but wonderful exhibit of experimental video and film at the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami. There are several interesting pieces in which artists cut up pieces of film or television to create their own works of art. Definitely worth seeing.

5. PENNY ARCADE

Video game enthusiasts Gabe and Tyco run their own comic strip that follows two characters based on themselves. Don't be afraid of their nerdiness - it's beautifully drawn and infinitely hilarious. Check them out at www.penny-arcade.com.

Headline: Going to class, going the way of the buffalo
Author: Aaron Karo / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
In between drinking and sleeping, college students have little time to squeeze in the necessary evil known as "going to class." College students don't really understand the meaning of the word "optional," as in "class is optional." We're sitting around freshman year and an upperclassmen or even a professor will say, "You know, class is optional." And we'll think, "Hey, doesn't optional mean I don't have to go?" And so we almost never do. 

Lately, it seems like colleges are actually encouraging kids not to go to class. We've got classes on tape, classes on the Internet and we can buy the notes. It's getting pretty ridiculous. It's gotten to the point where you're probably better off skipping all your classes and catching up on your sleep instead. And I love when the professor hands out all the notes and slides for the class on the first day. Are you kidding me? I usually raise my hand and ask when the midterm is because I know that's the next time I'm showing up.

When we do go to class, however, it's always an interesting experience because the classroom  is like a whole other world. You're sitting in the back of a huge lecture hall in these weird, constantly broken swivel chairs. You can barely stay awake because  you're still drunk from the night before, and some crazy professor with chalk all over him is going on and on about marginal demand or something. But just before you nod off completely, you hear the professor utter those wonderful words, "Remember, this assignment is optional," and you fall asleep with a smile on your face.

It's actually pretty difficult to become a college professor. First, you have to get your bachelor's degree. Then, you have to go back to school to get a Master's. After that you have go to school for another couple of years, write a 100-page thesis and get your Ph.D. Even then you still have to get your work published in order to get hired. So what happens after these professors go through all those years of school and get all those degrees? They lose the ability to realize that they have chalk all over their face, hands and pants, while lecturing in front of 300 students. You can tell every place your professor scratches because he leaves a trail of chalk dust and doesn't have a clue. And of course, no student is going to stand up and tell him he looks ridiculous, so the chalkiness continues.

I think it's a little messed up that some professors make their students buy a book that they wrote for the class they are teaching. I wonder even more when the professor teaches the textbook out of order. How can you disagree with the order of the book? You wrote it!

Headline: 'Phantom' film haunts big screen
Author: Michelle Ferrer / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
You know the story: The damsel in distress gets saved by the love of her life and lives happily ever after ... or does she?

Originally a novel by French author Gaston Leroux turned Broadway show by Andrew Lloyd Webber, "The Phantom of the Opera" stands as one of the worlds most beloved and recognized tales.

"'Phantom,' still running on Broadway after 16 years, is a rapturous spectacle," said Peter Travers for Rolling Stone magazine. "The movie, directed full-throttle by Joel Schumacher, goes the show one better."

"The Phantom of the Opera" opens as an auction is taking place at the Paris Opera House in 1911. Two items are for sale: a musical box with the figure of a mechanical monkey and the opera house's great chandelier. As the chandelier is raised to the opera house's ceiling, we are transported to Paris in 1881, where the opera company is rehearsing the new opera, "Hannibal."

A sudden turn of events makes a young background ballet dancer, Christine Daaé (Emmy Rossum), the new soprano for the opera "Populaire." However, this new blessing comes at a price for the young Christine. She is tutored in secret by a mysterious masked figure, the Phantom of the Opera, who is seemingly infatuated with her. As he leads her through the 19th century underground of Paris she begins to lose her child-like essence to the "Music of the Night." Her trip shows her journey from an orphan child of the opera house to the most sought after soprano in Paris. Thus, Christine, through the guidance of the phantom, reaches the point of no return.

On the opening night of "Hannibal," Raul Vicomte de Chagn (Patrick Wilson), Christine's childhood love, recognizes Christine as his long-lost love and intends to woo her after the performance. However, the phantom has alternate plans.

And so begins the beautiful love triangle between Raul, Christine and the Phantom. She must then choose between her "Angel of Music" or the love of her life.

"The cast is good, the score is sublime, the visuals are sumptuous and it speeds along with a delirious romantic power that, if you let it, can sweep you away," said William Arnold in an article for the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer."

Andrew Lloyd Webber's, "The Phantom of the Opera," was nominated for several 2005 Golden Globe Awards including: Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy (Rossum) and Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actress (Rossum).

Andrew Lloyd Webber's, "The Phantom of the Opera," opened on Friday Jan. 21 nationwide and is sure to be a show to remember.

Headline: Easy exercises for busy students
Author: Matt Santiago / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Ever wake up and decide it's time to get rid of those few extra pounds, or try to get those coveted "washboard" abs? Well, lucky you! Both University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus are equipped with a full gym and your tuition entitles you to use them as an FIU student.

If you think about toning you body, basic crunches won't cut it. Believe it or not, everyone has defined abs; however, they are hidden under a thin layer of fat that is just waiting to be burned off. Here is a basic workout routine that you can do that is both timely and effective. 

Start with a 10 to 15 minute cardio session. This can include the step machine, treadmill or a stationary bicycle. Compared with other workouts, cardio exercises burn fat at a faster rate while warming up the body for more strenuous exercises. 

After finishing the cardio session, head over to the crunch machine. Do a set of 10 crunches and rest for a few minutes. It is important for the body to get at least a three-minute rest before another set. Then do four sets of 10 crunches, and rest again for a few minutes. Once you have rested properly, adjust the machine for obliques (love handles), and do the same. 

For those hard to reach lower abs, one of the best exercises is leg raises. This can be done on almost any flat bench. Lie down, grip sides of the bench firmly and lift your legs without bending at the knee. It will become increasingly difficult shortly after starting, especially if you are a first time gym-goer, so only do about 10 repetitions at a time. 

Once you begin to see a definition of abs, leg raises can help maintain them.

"After already having perfect washboard abs, leg raises help keep them perfect and give me that 'v-cut' for the ladies," said gym-going sophomore Brian Machado.

Leg raises are very basic and can be done correctly in less than 30 minutes. More advanced routines yield faster results, but require much more dedication.

"I usually am cramped for time, so short routines are perfect for me," said sophomore Eytan Benichay.

Working out is only half the work. A good balanced diet will keep you not only in shape but also feeling great and healthy. Always consult a physician before starting any workout plan.

Headline: Tire fad spins away from FIU
Author: Betsy Martinez / Assistant Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Rolling past a new, chameleon-colored Cadillac with spinning alloy rims that cost around  $5,000, Armando Barreto couldn't believe his eyes.

From inside of his humble Honda Civic Barreto, stared with admiration until the car behind him honked desperately.

It wasn't the car's blinding colors or the rhythmic sound of Lil' Jon & The East Side Boyz blaring out of the car stereo. Instead, it was the sleek spinning rims that shocked him.

"The first time I saw them the car was dropped and it looked like it was floating," said Barreto, a junior majoring in mass communications.

The rim is the portion of a wheel incorporating the well, seats and flange where a tire is mounted.

Spinning rims, more popularly known as spinners, have a spinning core inside.  

On the exterior of the tire, the inner layer spins dependently and the outer layer spins independently. Spinners differ in design, price, size, weight and mounting options.

Rim sizes range from 20-26 inches, and for the right price the manufacturer will custom make spinners for a variety of cars from a 2005 Ford F150 to a 1973 Chevy Caprice Prices range from $1,000 to $15,000 or more.

"Now that everybody has them, I don't want to buy them," said Barreto, "I see people buying rims when they should be buying other necessities."

There have been several reported incidents of stolen spinners. Throughout Miami-Dade County, some residents have even chosen to exercise their first amendment right to bear arms to protect their glossy rims. Fortunately, according to the FIU Public Safety Department, there have been no reports of stolen spinners at the university.

"It's just not safe. I've had friends who've gotten into lots of unnecessary trouble over something so material," said Maria Chaves, a sophomore majoring in history.

For those who choose not to put their car in danger with a set of alloy rims, whitewall tires are making a come-back. Whitewalls are a trendy and less costly alternative to spinners. They also offer a more classic look. Whitewall tire makers basically take standard tires and melt a white lining around them.

However, it's not a good idea to make whitewalls at home by melting the rubber soles of an old pair of Converse high tops.

The price for four brand-new whitewall tires ranges from $200 to $300, which is very economic when compared to spinners.  

And, if you still can't bare to spend that much accessorizing your ride,  spinner hubcaps are another option. Although they are the less popular with FIU students than spinners and whitewall tires, they range in price from $30 to $50.

"I'd never buy spinner hubcaps. I think they're ridiculous," said Barreto.

Subheadline: Rage! Coping with madness on the road
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It's a flash of unadulterated rage - a pooling of lava that builds in the base of your spleen, shoots up your back, floods your face and causes you to say, or more likely scream, extremely rude things. "What the hell is wrong with you, you jerk? Learn to drive!" You swerve out of your lane and think to yourself how, in a city of millions, you were the only one who managed to learn how to operate a vehicle. 

Because FIU is mostly a commuter school, for many, road rage is a way of life. And for the few who have traveled to Miami from other parts of the country, Miamians' unique style of complete disregard for their fellow man may come as a bit of a surprise. These ideals translate on to the road quite well. 

If you're new to this feeling, don't fret. Here's a how-to on dealing with these emotions:

I feel all tingly inside

You may say, "I drove all through high school, and I've never experienced road rage before." While this may be true, you probably never drove as much as you do now. And if you thought your commute was bad then, now you're more likely to drive an hour between two campuses every other day and to battle in parking lots three times the size of your high school's lot. 

Face it. You're a likely candidate for the eventual flip-out. Remember, acceptance is the first step to recovery. 

It starts somewhere

When you're on the road, and you think to yourself "How the hell did these people get licenses?," you must think back to the source. To paraphrase Jerry Seinfeld, the only requirement to get a license these days is to have a face. 

The Department of Motor Vehicles or as I like to call it, the House for the Refuse of Society, is the root of all road rage. When you stand in line for three hours in a windowless shack where 47 percent of the people smell like cabbage, you're likely to snap once you get out of the parking lot. 

I will kill you and your dog!

It doesn't take much to identify road rage. Most likely, it will happen as such: You're driving on the turnpike and you have two minutes to be a reasonable 10 minutes late to class. 

You see your exit up ahead on the right, and put your turn signal on. All of a sudden, an 18-wheeler comes hurdling past your right, cuts you off, then slows down to 20 mph. 

You slam on your brakes, spill and/or choke on your scalding coffee and the car behind you screeches to a halt. 

Now, you have two options. You can pause, take three deep breaths, repeat a mantra of your choice, and proceed on your merry way or, you can speed up, cut-off the 18-wheeler, grab some sort of explosive you keep in your glove compartment, and hurl it at the offending vehicle. 

When the vehicle explodes and causes a 20-car pile up, pull over and light your cigarette with the off-shooting flames. Then, flee. (At this point, it's advisable to head south of the border - like Antarctica south.)

Whichever method you choose, you should feel much better once you deal with your aggression. That is the key to handling road rage. 

Alright, Alright

In retrospect, perhaps it isn't such a good idea to kill innocent people who are only trying to get to work and make wages to feed their hungry children. Needless to say, they probably deserve it.
