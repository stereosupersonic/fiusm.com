Headline: Dance classes promote fun, friendships

Walking through the Wolfe University Center on a Tuesday night students may hear salsa music and laughter as a result of Biscayne Bay Campus' Dancing with the Wolfe classes. 

These are free classes offered at BBC where students can choose to learn how to dance in ballroom, salsa, belly dancing or hip-hop styles. 

"The reason we offer these types of classes is because they are diverse and give students an opportunity to learn something new," said Leatrice Gachette, Student Programming Council secretary. 

BBC's Student Programming Council pays for Dancing with the Wolfe classes out of their budget, which is set by the Student Government Association. 

"Even though I have never danced before, I had a lot of fun," said FIU Freshman Daniel Jordan after participating in his first Dancing with the Wolfe Class. " I want to be more natural and comfortable at dancing." 

Just after one class, Jordan is planning on attending the salsa class regularly and wants to learn ballroom dancing.

When Jimmy Chang was offered to teach a salsa class during Hispanic Heritage month in 2002, he saw the appeal of teaching at FIU.

"The best part of this class is not that you're learning salsa, but that you're here to socialize, to have fun!" said Chang, who has made a lot of friends through these classes. 

Chang also teaches classes at Johnson and Wales University and Miami Dade College, allowing students from these schools to participate in the classes held at FIU. FIU students can take his salsa classes at these schools as well.

"[The salsa class] is really lively and has positive energy and vibes," Chang said.

Freshman Katie Bennet attends the salsa class for its social and health benefits.

"When you live on campus and there isn't that much to do at 6 p.m. on a weeknight, it's a great way to meet people and get a little exercise in too," Bennet said after her first Dancing with the Wolfe Class. 

Having been in a salsa club in high school, Bennett also wants to try her skills at ballroom dancing. 

"I wish I had come to the classes from the beginning of the semester," Bennet said, "I hope to learn some wicked moves to display at Homecoming."

A dancer for 30 years, Kira Cocchi is enjoying her first semester teaching belly dancing at FIU and already has a few students who have become regulars. 

"I like being able to educate people in this form of dance because I believe that art is something that will unite people across cultural, ethnic and religious differences," said Cocchi. 

The belly dancing class offers a diverse range of music, including Lebanese, Turkish and Israeli. 

Freshman Carrice Brown has attended class every week since the beginning of the semester.

"I really like the way [the instructor] breaks down the moves so you learn the technical aspects," Brown said.

Elegance Chang, a doctoral student, has been attending three Dancing with the Wolfe classes per week for the last year. 

"I like dancing and I want to be more energetic and in better shape," Chang said. "With work and school and studying, you need something to boost your energy, especially after spending hours on a computer, these classes are great."

Classes are held Monday through Thursday, in the Wolfe University Center rooms 155 and 157, at 6 PM.

Luis Polit started attending Dancing with the Wolfe classes in 2002 and, since graduating from FIU, still attends regularly. Polit has learned, "to continue to practice because if you take a semester off, you have to relearn all the steps".

Headline: SUPERMAN gets a new meaning: Dance craze puts Macarena to shame
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's not uncommon for a new dance to become a craze in South Florida, but few have been as prolific in recent memory as  that of Soulja Boy Tell'em.  

The current Billboard Hot 100 hit, with 13 weeks on the charts, "Crank Dat" had everyone learning, or at least talking about, the 17-year-old Soulja Boy's self-titled dance.  A YouTube search for videos of the dance will yield you everything from dancers who have great choreographic skill, to the complete lack thereof, and even a step-by-step instructional video. 

Aside from the physical component of "Crank Dat," which involves doing a Superman-style swoosh through the air and "cranking" it from left to right, the hot topic of discussion about the song is its lyrics.

By now it is known that the song, which often references Superman, is not just an innocent reference to a pop culture hero, but most of the words actually have hidden sexual meanings, which refer to using male reproductive functions in a way that asserts dominance over women.

It seems hard to settle what "Superman" actually means, though. Three different answers were given by three different students who all claimed to know the answer, none of which are appropriate for print in a newspaper.

Some argue the lyrics don't really matter.

"They are just filled with sexual innuendo and it is not worth the time analyzing the lyrics," said Lauren Perez, a freshman who is studying finance.

Pop culture that sexually degrades women is a hot topic of study in academia. Dionne Stephens, associate chair with the department of psychology at FIU, mentioned that the culture of hip-hop re-creates a stereotypical, historical image of women.

Stephens cited research, including a study conducted by Gina Wingood of Emory University, that correlated the watching of hip-hop videos with increases in sexual risk behaviors, including decreased condom usage among young women.

Despite this school of thought, the song remains immensely popular.  

Larissa Metalidis, a sophomore majoring in education, agrees the lyrics are immature and sexual but that the song is also "very catchy." 

The video attracts fans with its highly synchronized and energetic dance-moves, as well of the features of the song itself, which pandora.com categorizes as "southern rap roots, electronica influences, consistent rhyme patterns, boasting' lyrics and a dry recording sound."  

During a YouTube search, you will find other facets of the crank dat craze, too.  The aptly-titled Crank Squad has responded with "Crank Dat Spiderman," which takes a jab at the Superman-themed Soulja Boy song with the lyric "We don't Superman no more, we just Spiderman that h--." Urbandictionary.com reveals that "Spiderman" has an equally sexual meaning.

Some of the crank dat spin-offs get absurd.  People have come up with all sorts of parodies and spin-offs including: 

Crank Dat Grandpa in which the dance imitates the movements of an old man and includes the lyric "crank dat heart attack" and the subject of the video imitates having a heart attack and falling on the ground.

Crank Dat Lion King, which incorporates music from the famed Disney classic and creates the feel of the wilderness through the sounds and the accompanying dance, which mimics searching through a jungle.

Crank Dat Jump Rope, which harks back to the innocent days of adolescence and imitates none other than the act of using a jump rope.

And Crank Dat Aquaman has the subject wearing a very awkward pair of aquatic goggles.

There are also many videos of the original Soulja Boy song set to cartoons such as Spongebob Squarepants and Barney.  

In these, the makers of the videos took scenes from the shows that seem to have characters talking or moving in ways that go along with the song. 

 The future of DeAndre Way, the real name of the young prodigy, is still dim.  

It seems that he will just try to play off the success of his first hit, instead of trying anything new, with his new song "Soulja Girl."

Headline: Student finds outlet for self on new EP
Author: Lyndsay Hall / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Described as having poetic lyrics and a sound similar to that of Coldplay, Radiohead and the 80's electric dance era, FIU student Gerardo Brenes hopes to enlighten listeners with his recently downloadable Extended Play disc Chromatic. 

As four songs have already been released on his web site gerardobrenes.com, the self-proclaimed alternative electronic pop musician has spent the past three months recording songs in his home studio. 

Brenes began writing slow, love ballads in the sixth grade. His lyrics have since matured and now focus on society as a whole. Brenes finds inspiration for his music during talks with his girlfriend, Natalie Ramirez.

"I may think something and talk to her about it," Brenes said. "The ideas blossom into what becomes a song. She inspires them even if they're not about her."

Ramirez notes that most topics of discussion include society and that some people do not always see "the bigger picture." Over the past two and half years of dating, Ramirez has noticed a slight change in his writing habits.

"Only up until a few months ago, he didn't write very often," Ramirez said. "When we first met, he only showed me a couple songs, mostly about higher knowledge. Now he writes more about society, but for the most part his style hasn't changed much."

While all of the songs hold a special meaning to Brenes, he says the most meaningful one is titled "The Lies."

"The song refers to people being susceptible to the most trivial things," Brenes said. "As you're being raised, you're influenced by your friends, parents and teachers; some parts of your personality are lost when trying to please [others]. After a while, people can become so attached to other things that it becomes you. You change yourself without ever realizing it."

"The Lies" is only one of many songs that will be relatable to listeners - Brenes has left many of his lyrics up to interpretation on purpose. 

"I always have a very specific idea of what I'm writing, but some lyrics may be vague and poetic in nature," he said. "I do that because it can remind people of things that have happened to them. I want people to apply the words to their own life. 

An anonymous fan describes Brenes' music as being reflective, saying that "all hearts are able to make room for it." Ramirez believes this is the precise reaction Brenes deserves. She hopes people will give the album a chance and not categorize it as "another pop album."

"People are too concerned with what is immediately catchy, and while the music does catch attention, it goes to another level," Ramirez said. 

During the process of making his debut album, Brenes has found himself writing more than usual. Inspired simply by the word "chromatic" to begin the writing process. 

The first song for the album, "Inspector," was written in just one night.

"Within the first week, I wrote a song every day. In a week I had five songs, which eventually turned into an average of two songs a week. I would sit down at the piano and wrote whatever came to mind, either words, music or a theme," Brenes said. 

Brenes has started small by passing out his disc to anyone who will listen, free of cost. Songs can also be downloaded on his web site or heard in the play list for the Graham Center. 

In a few months, he plans to expand his fan base by selling his full-length album. 

"Sometimes artists try their luck and take [their record] to every record label, but they need to be careful because if something falters, then that's it," Brenes said. "Instead, I want to let people hear my music and create a fan base. I want to prove that I can be successful in Miami then go to the labels."

There is currently no set release date for the full-length album.

Headline: Club focuses on building relationships with God
Author: Lyndsay Hall / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
During meetings, the organization Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) begins with a simple discussion about God. Scriptures are read from the Bible and together, members speak with one another on topics that include self-justification and the answering of questions such as "What are some common examples in your life of justifying yourself?" 

These meetings, taking place Thursday afternoons at 3:15 p.m. in GC 314, are enjoyed by almost 30 members; member Michelle Essary describes this year as a restart year because most members graduated last semester. 

CCC, founded in 1951 by Bill and Vonette Bright, has rapidly spread from its original location in the University of California, Los Angeles. Chapters can be found across the United States , with a total of more than 1,000 locations world-wide, according to the official web site campuscrusadeforchrist.com

"At [FIU], Anel Avila started Campus Crusade," director Erik Williams said. 

As part of CCC, members participate in numerous activities throughout the year to grow closer to God and to promote their club. 

"We'll be on campus [Oct. 17] talking to students and letting people know what we're up to. We'll have a table for people who are interested," Essary said.

Other activities include the club's fall retreat in Boca Raton, which happened earlier this semester. Other chapters that attended included those from University of Miami and Florida Atlantic University. 

Aside from the fall retreat, club members also take a part in a Christmas Conference in Atlanta, Georgia between Dec. 27 and Jan. 2. 

"There will be Christian bands, speakers, seminars and 'boxes of love' given to those in Atlanta that don't have as much, and we'll talk to people about God," Essary said. "There will be a huge party on New Years [also]." 

To complement the weekly meetings, there is a girls' Bible study in Lakeview South Lounge. It begins with each girl sharing a good and bad experience from the previous week and then continues into the topic of asking God for help in one's everyday life. 

Essary believes the goal of CCC is for everybody at FIU to know somebody that has a relationship with God.

"[The organization's] heart is that people have the opportunity to   know the Lord, be developed and built in a relationship with God, and for them then to have the strength to give other people an opportunity to know the Lord and have a relationship with God," Essary said. 

Club member Sean Cassidy desires to help inspire evangelism, while Williams wants to help students develop spiritual relationships.

"I'd really like to see students have a relationship with God, especially those who didn't grow up with God. College is a key point in a kid's life where they're making decisions with what to believe spiritually," Williams said.

While club member Ashlyn Kirkpatrick was simply looking for a solid group of people with a Bible study, fellow member Phillip Johnson found this same group to be much more.

"I was drawn in by the people. They are all very nice with a lot of diversity. There is not just one race; it shows that God can touch all different colors of skin and ethnicity," Johnson said.

Headline: Review: Sin and Punishment (Review)
Subheadline: Players revisit Nintendo classic via download service
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Seven years ago at the twilight of the Nintendo 64's run, Japan saw one of developer Treasure's finest shooters, Sin and Punishment.  

It never saw release in other territories and became the target for rare game collectors all over.  Now, through the Wii's Virtual Console download service, the masses can now discover the once lost N64 masterpiece.

As mankind enters a new era of peace, overpopulation strangles the world's food supplies. Scientists develop a new species of life to be bred as a new food source, which eventually mutates, multiplies and destroys, leading to world-wide panic.  

As peace keepers step in to quell the violence, another faction, lead by a self-proclaimed "savior," prepares to fight the beasts as well as oppose the peacekeepers; Saki and Airan, fighting on behalf of the new group, soon realize the "savior's" true motive and begin a fight to decide the fate of all life on Earth.  

While the story is mainly an excuse to shoot everything that moves, it is quite a step up from others in the same genre.

The game takes a bit of a different approach to three-dimensional rail shooters.  

As your character moves forward, you can move left and right, rolling and jumping to avoid attacks and hazards, while using the analog stick to aim and fire.  

The aiming cursor can be adjusted to lock on to targets, so the player can concentrate on dodging.  

Also at your disposal is a melee attack to dispatch enemies at close range as well as deflect shots to wherever you aim.  

While tricky at first, there is a tutorial to practice.  

Given that the game was designed with the N64 controller in mind, the Wii classic controller serves as a fine substitute.

The game is rather short, but still challenging. 

A time limit adds extra pressure,  and the game throws plenty of excitement and dangers to players, including a climactic final battle that must be seen to be believed.  Two players can get in on the action - one controls movement and dodging while the other takes aim and attacks.

If there was any title that pushed the N64's capabilities, it was this one, although it is a far cry from what we are used to now.  

The game is visually replicated without a hitch; cut scenes and fully voiced dialogue progress the story and give tribute to Treasure's storytelling and optimal use of limited hardware that can still be appreciated today.

The $12 price tag might be a bit much for a downloadable game, but for something like Sin and Punishment, it is well worth it.  

Although many missed out on an outstanding and unique 3D shooter years ago, Nintendo has rightfully done gamers a huge favor in making an unknown gem of a game known to all.

Headline: Review: Jimmy Eat World - Chase This Light (Music)
Subheadline: Band attempts new sound
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Like many of their brethren in the emo genre, Jimmy Eat World have made quite a career out of singing about inabilities to move past adolescence. 

For basically its entire career, the band's lyrics have read like your typical MySpace blog: full of awkward first kisses and affirmations that being different isn't such a bad thing, no matter what the cool kids might say.

From debut album Jimmy Eat World, to a first appearance in the public consciousness with the self-esteem boosting hit single "The Middle," to the latest sixth album, Chase This Light, due out Oct. 16 on Interscope Records, Jimmy Eat World has strayed very little from its signature style.

With Chase This Light, however, the band has at least made an attempt at maturing sound and lyrical approaches, even if the songs in question don't match the band's aspirations. 

While many of the songs are reminiscent of the older material - big choruses and sugary sweet verses - a few songs, specifically "Electable (Give It Up)" and "Gotta Be Somebody's Blues" represent a somewhat new approach for the band.

"Electable" is Jimmy Eat World's attempt at making a political song, and while lyrically it is a bit cumbersome, with lines such as "Talking points from talking heads with automated smiles/there's no higher ground to stand than bottom of the pile," there is obvious passion in the song that has to be admired, even if the execution isn't all there.

"Gotta Be Somebody's Blues" demonstrates a new sound for the band. 

As opposed to the high energy and catchy choruses the band has been known for, this track is a mid-tempo, bass heavy tune that features some ill-advised synthesized strings throughout.

 The band is obviously trying to go for an ominous feel with the song, but the strings end up sounding like a bad parody of "Strawberry Fields Forever" with some of the most nonsensical lyrics in the entire Jimmy Eat World catalogue. 

While this song fails, the idea of the band attempting to make a new sound for themselves is probably the only noteworthy part of this entire album for non die-hard fans.

While neither of those songs will be remembered as strong tracks, if the band wants to continue to stay relevant, it should try to mature as a group. 

Going 13 years into a career that has seen the band grow from some of the leaders of the still underground emo movement in the mid '90s to a group that has garnered heavy rotation on MTV for numerous songs, strong, catchy tunes like "Feeling Lucky," "Big Casino" and "Dizzy" are to be expected from this band, and it has become predictable and formulaic. 

Sure, the songs are enjoyable, but the band has done the same thing for six albums, and even the strongest bands have a tough time staying relevant without reinventing themselves before long. Jimmy Eat World has long past that point.

Overall, Chase This Light is just another album from a band that knows how to craft catchy songs with relative ease. It is enough to keep the die-hards happy, but if you haven't been a fan of the band before this, you will find very little to interest you.

Headline: Hispanic Heritage: Events raise cultural awareness, interest
Author: Elvis Ramirez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Hispanic Heritage Committee chose to hold events celebrating Hispanic heritage throughout the month of October because it is easier to represent many cultures with this amount of time, according to Gabriel Labrador, committee chair.	

The committee's goal was to steer students away from the belief that Hispanic cultures are all the same, said Michelle Oria, the vice president of external affairs for the Student Programming Council at University Park.

"It's [Hispanic heritage] not just one culture," Oria said. "When most people think of Hispanic Heritage they think of Cinco de Mayo. 

When you look online everything about Hispanic heritage is Cinco de Mayo."

To celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month SPC at both UP and the Biscayne Bay Campus planned several events that will continue until the beginning of November.

The UP council will host a variety of events during these weeks. On Oct. 27, SPC-UP will host Carnaval, an event where almost every Hispanic country and culture will be represented, in Lot 3. Displays with information on a specific country's culture will be a large part of the event. 

The event is free to students who are each allowed to bring two guests. There will be food and DJs mixing music throughout the event. 

It's more of a celebration of Hispanic heritage, the political aspect of the culture is not the focus of the festivities at UP, according to Oria.

"The Carnaval has been in the planning stages since September and is a big event," Oria said. "[The committee planned the Carnaval] so everyone has the chance to participate in Hispanic heritage."

At BBC, flyers have been distributed to promote Hispanic Heritage Month, but they are not accurate because several events, such the Hallow's Eve Kid's Event Oct. 29 and the Iron Chef Latin America Oct. 22, were cancelled. An updated schedule can be found at the Campus Life office at the Wolfe University Center, room 141.

A movie series is being planned at BBC for the week of Oct. 22. The movies and the days they will be shown are still being discussed.

A student-led discussion forum on the topic of Cuba will lead the day-long Afro-Cuban Celebration Oct. 24. The discussion will be centered on Cuba and its culture and politics but the topic may not stay on just Cuba, according to Labrador.

Another political discussion forum on a topic yet to be announced will be held Oct. 31. 

These discussions will be held in Panther Square at WUC. 

"I think people can get more connected, more active when discussing something with their peers, with some one of their own age set that knows what issues that they're facing. They may not necessarily agree but that's the beauty of political discussion," Labrador said.

The final event will be a celebration of Dia de los Muertos, a holiday practiced throughout Latin America that honors and celebrates the dead. The event will run Nov. 1 to Nov. 2, the traditional days used to honor the deceased children and adults, respectively. 

An information session detailing the specifics of the holiday and its historical significance will be held Nov. 1 from noon to 1 p.m. at Panther Square.

"It actually translates to African culture because the Day of the Dead is celebrated in Madagascar, in Nigeria and a lot of African countries ... It shows how closely tied the cultures are," Labrador said. 

An altar may be constructed although its location and the building process are still being discussed. If it is constructed, people will be able to bring offerings, such as a deceased relative's favorite drink, to the altar. Restrictions against alcoholic beverages will apply.

These events being held during Hispanic Heritage Month are about broadening student's horizon and educating them about the differences and similarities in Hispanic cultures, said Vanessa Robinson, former vice president of SPC-BBC and last year's chair of the Hispanic Heritage committee. The committee wanted to bring all of the Hispanic cultures together.

"We don't expect to change people's minds in [a couple of days]," Robinson said. 

Labrador wants everyone to get involved in the events on both campuses. 

He said he takes the celebration's events very seriously due in part to the fact that his heritage is rooted in Mexico.

"[Just like the saying] everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day, well everybody is Hispanic on Hispanic Heritage Month. 

"It doesn't matter whether you're black, if you're white, if you're Asian, if you're from Australia… After all, that's the beauty of it," Labrador said.

Headline: Yes, I mind very much if you smoke
Author: Sameer Mehta / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
People may have the inalienable right to poison themselves but they certainly have no right to poison another. You let that same person blow malodorous filthy smoke into your face and you're supposed to realize that smokers have rights, too. Well, it's a real interesting concept.

Saying smoking is 'bad' is underrated. By given facts it is much easier to comprehend the damage they do on a yearly basis.

Each year, because of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, or ETS, an estimated 3,400 nonsmoking Americans die of lung cancer and 300,000 children suffer from lower respiratory tract infections. In the United States, 21 million, or 35 percent of children live in homes where residents or visitors smoke in the home on a regular basis. The estimated number of children exposed to ETS in the home ranged from 32,105 (Delaware) to 1,120,051 (New York). Particularly alarming is the fact that more than 3 million young people under the age of 18 smoke half a billion cigarettes each year and more than half of them consider themselves dependent upon cigarettes.

Yes, these are the statistics we have in our American society and sadly, we are aware of the dangers of smoking and second-hand smoke.  It is embarrassing to know that smokers in our society not only pose a threat to their own health but also produce a tremendous amount of side effects onto their fellow beings. And because smokers may want to smoke absent-mindedly around anyone, there should be a statutory warning on the cigarette packet stating "smoking is injurious to others health also".

One FIU Graduate student, Indu Prasadh at FIU, expressed that smoking on campus was injurious to her as well as her two and half year old child, Nitin. 

"Spending some time with my kid on campus at FIU seems to be injurious for the health of both me and my kid. My kid had experienced the effect of secondhand smoke on campus by having cough and lower respiratory tract infection after having exposure to it only twice," Prasadh said.

Secondhand smoke is the number one killer in the American workplace. 

Prasadh was concerned about how to say no to smokers. You could try and ask them politely, "I would like to ask a favor. Would you stop smoking?" Or "I would really appreciate it. My doctor says tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer in nonsmokers."

ETS or passive smoke, is a mixture of 2 forms of smoke from burning tobacco products: side stream smoke that comes from the lighted end of the cigarette, pipe or cigar and Mainstream smoke that is exhaled by a smoker. It is so harmful that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has classified it as a Group A Carcinogen-which are known to be the most toxic substance to cause cancer in humans, like radon, benzene and asbestos.

Now, even Florida has started with the preventive steps to rid itself of public smoking in the workplace and outside of it. Santa Rosa County officials of Florida are starting an awareness campaign to help pregnant women quit smoking. Members of the Florida legislature are pushing a measure that would revise the state's Clean Indoor Air Act to make it clear that businesses are responsible for smoking violations on their property. A proposed constitutional amendment that would require the state to spend about $54 million annually on anti-smoking campaigns drew no opposition as the Florida Supreme Court considered whether to allow it on the ballot.

When a smoker feels the need the publicly 'light up', they should be reminded that by doing so they are threatening the health of others. Smoking in public should be illegal-- this may sound radical, but when you break it down, where is the rationality in threatening another's health?

Headline: Nobel Prize losing credibility?
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Nobel Prize is one of the most coveted honors on Earth but will its momentum one day run out?

The major problem with the Nobel Peace Prize is that it doesn't allow enough time to pass so as to see if the efforts of its recipients, or laureates, actually work.  Effort is not everything and just because a world entity engages in diplomatic talks doesn't render them an officer of peace.

Former Vice President Al Gore, who gave up politics after conceding the 2000 election to George W. Bush in order to expose the urgency of global climate change. Now he, along with a United Nations climate change panel, has a Nobel Prize to recognize their work. Global Warming is an issue just coming into the forefront this decade and the details of it are still being discovered and debated.  Gore deserves credit for bringing awareness to the issue but at this point in the game it is hard to tell how much knowledge about climate change is still subject to revision, as even valid scientific theories take time to fully develop. 

Some Nobel Prize decisions have looked pretty dubious in retrospect, which can damage the credibility of the award.

One laureate who calls into question the Nobel Prize's validity is Yasser Arafat. Arafat was the former Chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the group that was widely believed to ultimately be behind the kidnapping and murder of 11 Israel athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany as well as countless terrorist attacks against civilians.

So, why did Arafat win the prize in the first place?  Well, in the early 1990s Arafat, to the dismay of the terrorist groups who looked up to him as leader, began to sit down in peace negotiations with the Israeli leaders including the 1993 Oslo Accords and 2000 Camp David Summit.  It begs the question of whether a life long murderer can be praised for peace if he reforms in the last years of his life.

 We can speculate all day if Arafat was ever sincere in his agreements and whether or not he deserved the prize.  But let us say that Arafat, in the end of his life was indeed a good man who desired peace.  Did his efforts work?  Last time I checked the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was still raging as if kerosene had been poured over a grease fire.  

The Oslo Accords, which were directly responsible for Arafat being honored, lead to the creation of the Palestinian Authority.  The Authority, as of 2006, is controlled by Hamas, which is listed as a terrorist organization by major governments including the United States, Canada and the European Union.

    Nonetheless, the Prize is not without honor, considering that other than Arafat, Gore also share this distinction with revolutionary icons such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mother Teresa.  Only time will tell if Gore will also achieve such iconic status in history and if the Prize will retain its reputation.

Headline: Editorial: Bill will help students avoid troublesome debt
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In an effort to curb the number of students who end up in debt upon graduation,  Congress has proposed a new bill that would set a barrier on the size of the credit limit students can acquire from private creditors.

Debt among college students is a major problem. According to a 2004 study of credit-use by student loan lender Nellie Mae, the average debt a college student has a credit card debt of $1,843.

Congress believes the best way to fix this problem is to limit college student's credit limit by 20 percent of their income through the College Student Credit Card Protection Act. If the bill is passed, it would only apply to college students under the age of 21. Students who receive the permission of their parents would be exempted from this limitation.

It is a shame that such a law needs to be proposed. In today's society, an individuals credit history can determine whether or not one can receive a mortgage, a loan to purchase a new house or even get a job. Many lenders are targeting students, one of the more underprivileged segments of the population and offering them massive credit limits. 

By doing this private creditors are luring them into years of financial hardship. Ultimately, this approach is very profitable for the companies, because it guarantees that these expenditures are paid off with interest, often over the course of many years.

These actions by these companies need to be curbed, however, the key to this problem is education. More efforts need to be taken to enable students to make wise fiscal decisions and render laws such the one proposed by Congress unnecessary.

Headline: Hate crime charges dropped
Author: Maria Chercoles / News Director
&nbsp;
Prosecutors of the alleged Sept. 23 hate-crime against a black FIU student announced last week that they plan to drop the charges.

FIU student Stephen Barrett, 18, who was called a racist slur and later beaten along  with two college friends, told prosecutors that the 15-year old accused of the slur did not use the N-word but rather said "nigga," a less-loaded term rooted in hip-hop culture.

''Maybe things got [hectic] because of it ...  I don't believe that they wanted to come after me just because I was black,'' Barrett said, according to a transcript of an interview released Oct. 17, The Miami Herald reported.

However, the five teens arrested in the Haulover Beach Park Marina incident still face charges for battery with prejudice.  

The decision was announced in a Miami-Dade Community Relations Board meeting Oct. 17, meant to ease tensions among black leaders. 

Ed Harris, director of the special projects for Miami-Dade's office of community relations, told The Miami Herald that the case underscores the danger of the word in all its variations.

''We need to eliminate it. People have died because of it,'' Harris said.

Witnesses told prosecutors that the teen used the word simply because he was ``ghetto.''

''This was a fight that involved blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians. It was not a hate crime. It included everyone,'' said Miami-Dade prosecutor Breezye Telfair during the meeting, as reported by The Miami Herald.

The incident took place when Barrett and fellow college students Christopher Eden, 18, and Daniel Cabezas, 18, tried to return in a ferry from a keg party on an island in the Intercoastal Waterway and were asked to get off because the boat was at capacity. After the three students refused to leave, a teen told Barrett, ''Nigga, get off the boat,'' officials said during the meeting.

When the FIU students reached the marina, a group of about 10-15 people were waiting with baseball bats. Barrett was hit in the back of the head but it's still unknown who did it.

The Miami Herald reported that prosecutors might also drop the battery charges.

''No one knows who hit who,'' Telfair told the board. ``Where it stands now, we cannot prove anything.''

Later investigations show that no one had tried to drown Barrett as was previously reported.

Barrett, Cabezas and Eden refused to comment because of the pending lawsuit.

The teens must appear in court Oct. 24.

Headline: Act proposes credit restrictions for students
Author: Kevin Smith / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the number of students suffering from credit card debt nearly doubling each year, U.S. Representative Louise Slaughter has proposed the College Student Credit Card Protection Act, which would limit the credit card spending of college students to 20 percent of their annual income. 

"It's astonishing to me to see college students coming out of school with staggering amounts of debt and credit scores so abominable that they couldn't rent a car," Slaughter said in an interview with MSNBC Sept. 5.

Slaughter's bill, which was proposed  Aug. 1, is actually an amendment to the Consumer Credit Protection Act of 2005. 

The proposed amendment would apply the 20 percent restrictions of credit card spending only to students under the age of 21. The amendment will also prohibit students from receiving more than one credit card without the student presenting proof of independent income. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban affairs but no decisions have been made.

Those who would fall under the Act's restrictions could have their parents co-sign with them on credit card applications for higher spending limits. 

According to Nellie Mae, a major student loan provider, the average college student incurs a credit card debt of over $1,843. 

The Educational Resources Institute, along with the Institute for Higher Education Policy, showed that 77 percent of college students used their credit cards for every day personal expenses and reached their credit limit within weeks. 

The bill would apply to students such as junior Anthony Rodriguez, who received his first credit card when he began his college career in 2005.  Rodriguez began charging every day items to his card and quickly racked up a $1500 debt. 

"I was shocked when my credit card limit was hit and my financial aid wasn't enough to pay it completely off," Rodriguez said. 

The validity of the amendment is under debate. 

"I feel though that this legislation is a bit too invasive to work," said junior Noelle Reed. 

Reed said that she has taught many of her friends to budget their money in college but feels the Legislature is overstepping their bounds with the amendment.

Cary Diaz, member service representative for the University Credit Union, has little faith in the amendment as well. 

"Many students who apply for a credit card do not have a job and are usually working on their parent's income," Diaz said. "Along with that many students are too young to know how to budget their money."  

Other students such as freshman Arlene Heredia like the idea.

"Having a low credit limit not only helps me keep my finances organized but also forces me to make choices such as saving money for groceries over splurging on Coldstone," Heredia said.  

Whether the CSCCA amendment will be the turning point in student debt, or not, is still pending. 

"Graduating from college is exciting, and it is not fair to have this dream dashed by the prospect of years of credit card debt repayment," said US Rep. John J. Duncan Jr. while proposing the CSCCA to Congress with Slaughter.

Headline: 'Green' hopes stem class project
Author: Evelyn Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students in professor Yolanda Cal's Advertising 3200 Creative Concepts class are using their creativity to get FIU students thinking about the environment and ways to "Make Recycling Fun."

Presently, FIU seems to lead in campus recycling among colleges and universities in Miami. 

FIU already recycles paper, aluminum, plastics, glass, light bulbs, cardboard paper, wood pallets, car batteries and trees. 

The University of Miami and Florida Atlantic University only recycle paper, cardboard, plastic bottles and aluminum cans, while Miami-Dade College does not recycle at all.  

But Cal wants to do more. She says she came up with the idea of a group project that focuses on recycling because she wants to do a good deed for the environment and to offer her students a hands-on assignment. 

Cal's project has caught on in her class, with many groups coming up with new ways to increase recycling on campus. 

Evelyn Ferro and her group have come up with the idea of hosting an event for people to exchange recycling materials for items other people no longer want and to provide booths on recycling awareness information around campus. 

 "I'm interested [in increasing recycling on campus] because I think it's a problem that directly or indirectly affects all of us. I think the school is not doing its best to address this issue and students, as part of the FIU community, should come up with a plan to get involved in it," Ferro said. 

Carol Wang and her group want to encourage volunteerism by placing color-coded bins around campus, putting up posters to remind students to recycle and to make a small club for students who wish to be a part of recycling at FIU. Wang believes that every little bit will help when it comes to recycling. 

"Since FIU is full of hundreds of students, even our [small] contribution to recycling will make a difference," Carol Wang said in an e-mail.

Other group ideas involve competing with different universities, wearing shirts about recycling on certain days, forming a club and hosting festivals. While the group's ideas all differ, most everyone agrees that more recycling bins should be available around campus.

According to Zachary Trautenberg, an information technology & marketing specialist at FIU, the reason FIU has not increased the recycling bins is because FIU does not have enough man power due to lack of funds and knowledge on proper recycling habits from both students and FIU staff.

"The best thing to do is to explain how to recycle," Trautenberg said. "First thing we have to do, is work with what we have and then increase it." 

To do that, Trautenberg and his group "Go Green" have been working since the beginning of the fall semester along with other groups at FIU and SGA, trying to make the process of recycling better.  

Student Government Association Vice President Arthur "AJ" Meyer appreciates the work of Cal's class and the "Go Green" group and encourages other students to take up the cause.

"If the students come up to us with a proposal and an idea, we would love to help that student with that idea," Meyer said. "We wish we had more students doing that. Not enough students take that initiative."

University House Renamed to honor 40th U.S. President:

University House, the official residence of President Modesto Maidique and his wife Nancy, has been renamed the Ronald W. Reagan Presidential House.

The name change is the result of a bill passed by the Florida Legislature earlier this year, which also names 11 other buildings in the State University System. FIU alumnus and State Representative David Rivera sponsored the bill for the name change.

The Ronald W. Reagan Presidential House opened in 2002 and is located near the east edge of FIU-University Park. President Maidique and his wife use the house to host distinguished guests, such as the 14th Dalai Lama and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe.

"Nancy and I are proud to live in a house named for a president best known for helping put an end to communism in Europe," Maidique said in a press release. "His legacy is of particular significance for us here in Miami and especially at FIU because this University stands for freedom."

FIU president Modesto Maidique announced Oct. 18 that Amir Mirmiran, professor and chair of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, has accepted to serve as Interim Dean of the College of Engineering and Computing. 

Mirmiran was recommended to fill the position by the Faculty Council of the College and was also recommended by Nino Masnari, who declined the position. 

One of Mirmiran's first duties will be to oversee the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology reaccreditation.

Headline: BRAGGING RIGHTS: Women's soccer drops  cross-town rivalry  match to Hurricanes
Author: Ryan Abbey / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The women's soccer team fell 3-1 to the cross-town rival University of Miami Hurricanes Oct. 17 at University Park.

To many this was more than a soccer game. The fans focused mainly on bragging rights and team pride.  

Once play began, FIU and UM were attacking back and forth with each other.

The Golden Panthers almost shocked the Hurricanes by nearly taking the lead in the second minute when junior forward Maria Gauldron was wide open in front of the net, but her shot sailed above the crossbar. 

Prior to taking the lead, UM had a chance to score when Brittney Macdonald found herself in front of the net with the ball before freshman midfielder Kassandra Sorzano made a tackle to prevent the goal.

The intensity of the match's first few minutes was reflected by the UM bench players, as they were  standing until after the first goal was scored, which came seconds after Macdonald's missed scoring opportunity. Freshman standout forward Brittney Stienbruch crossed up FIU goalkeeper Madeline Gannon in the 12th minute of the game. 

Seven minutes later Stienbruch added another goal in a similar way, as she found the back of the net on another cross shot, bringing her season total to 15.

Freshman Claudia Cardenas got FIU back into the game with a score off a pass from Marina Pappas. Cardenas' score, which was her fourth of the season, came in the 37th minute and gave FIU a shot at tying the game before the end of the first half.

However, the Golden Panthers could not find any more offense and UM led 2-1 at the halftime whistle.

In the second half, a strong defensive effort led by seniors Kristin Hurst and Kia Rigsby held off the Hurricane offense long enough to keep FIU in the game and give its offense a few more opportunities.

The Golden Panthers had a couple of promising opportunities to equalize the match, including one in the 68th minute when Cardenas saw her shot in front of the net sail wide. 

The Hurricanes eventually added one more goal, which ended up being the final score of the evening. 

After the final whistle sounded, coach Thomas Chestnutt commended the University of Miami on a match well played.

"This is probably the most complete team we have faced all season," Chestnutt said. 

All the remaining regular season games for the Golden Panthers are Sun Belt Conference games. 

"There is no doubt that we need to win some games" Chestnutt said.

Chestnutt said he will depend on the leadership of the team to come through during the final stretch or matches.

Next up, the Golden Panthers remain at home for a weekend series against conference rivals Arkansas State and Arkansas-Little Rock Oct. 26 and 28, respectively.

Headline: Swimmer preparing for international competition
Author: Jonathan Ramos / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For the second consecutive season, FIU will send only one representative to the 2007 Pan American Maccabi Games to compete in women's open swimming competition: Meredith Tisch.

 The junior will participate in the 11th annual Pan American Maccabi Games Dec. 26- Jan. 2. It will be her second time at the event, competing against six other countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, Australia and Costa Rica.

She will travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina looking to take first place wearing the United States' colors.

"It is the greatest feeling to be out there representing the United Sates," she said. "It is like a mini-Olympics with the ceremonies and the atmosphere you are around. I am very exited to go back."

Tisch, who swam for Ward Melville High School (N.Y), finished second in the 800 meter freestyle event during the 10th Pan American games in Santiago, Chile, but is not bitter about the finish. In fact, she is very content with the results.

"I was not disappointed at all because my own teammate won," Tisch said. "I was just extremely excited that I swam well enough to place and get a medal."

For Tisch, the experience of traveling to another country to compete against fellow elite swimmers was enough to justify her journey to Chile. The trip will not be a complete loss if she does not obtain the gold.

"I was just happy to be there, it was a great experience," she said. "It was amazing. I just want to be the best that I can, but if I don't bring home the medal I will not be upset."

Tisch especially liked the foreign appeal of the event.

"It was a extremely international," she said. "You get to meet a bunch of new, cool people and you get to play the sport you love."

During the first week of the trip, the team was taken on a tour of Chile, an experience Tisch will never forget. The surroundings in the area were much different than Florida.

"It was extremely beautiful because the city was within the mountains and the houses were very close together," she said. "The sight-seeing during the first week was very pretty. We went to a small market and the Chilean people treated us very well. It wasn't one of those fake tours with a little key chain. They made tourist things with their own hands and gave us a great tour."

In order to prepare for this year's competition, she will not break her normal routine. She plans to conduct her regular swimming practices with teammates.

"I'm just practicing as hard as I can, just as I would do normally," she said.

The routine the team conducts includes two-a-day practices three times a week,  starting with an early morning practice, the an afternoon swim. 

Swimming coach Noemi Lung-Zaharia believes the practice schedule is grueling but necessary for Tisch and her teammates to be able to compete at a high level.

"It is a very demanding sport that takes a lot of time and energy, especially at the Division I level," Lung-Zaharia said. "Being in Division I makes it all much harder than being in Division II or Division III based on the teams we have to play."

Tisch, who competed in the 50, 100, 200, and 500-yard freestyle for FIU in 2006-07, is no stranger to regional competition either. 

In high school, she competed in the Empire State games, which is a New York area event that features the top athletes in each region. 

Though Tisch did not win at the Empire state games either, she believes those experiences have helped mold her into the swimmer and person she is today.

"This is just another added-on experience," she said.

Although Tisch isn't too concerned about winning it all, Lung-Zaharia will be cheering her on from thousands of miles away.

"Our philosophy and my goal as a head coach is to push them to their limit," Lung-Zaharia said. "My job is to make her the best she can be and I am very proud of the work she is doing. She works very hard and it has only made her better. I'm excited for her because she is not only representing the United States but FIU as well."

Tisch appreciates the extra push from her coach.

"She is very supportive and she really wants me to go all the way," Tisch said. "She does a great job in trying to get me to reach my limit. She is a great coach."

Tisch also shares a bond with her parents, who come to watch her from New York whenever they can.

"I am very close to them because I am an only child," she said. "They are retired and they are coming to live in their North Miami Beach condo in November to get to see me more."

In addition to her participation in the upcoming Maccabi games, Tisch still has academic and athletic responsibilities at FIU. Lung-Zaharia thinks she is an example of what a student-athlete should be. 

Tisch, who is majoring in criminal justice, keeps a good GPA up and sets an example for her teammates.

"She does a great job of balancing it all between the Macabbi games and our season," Lung-Zaharia said.

Her teammates have taken notice as well.

"She was voted as one of our two co-captains of the team," Lung-Zaharia said. "Her teammates chose her based on her leadership, and she has worked hard for it. As a captain she now has even more responsibility."

For now, Tisch will look forward to the upcoming games. She enjoyed her first time at the Maccabi event so much that she can see herself being part of it for a long time.

"I want to do this for as long as I can," she said.

Headline: Men's basketball holds open tryout
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's basketball team held an open tryout for any students wishing to walk on to the team on Oct. 15. 

Thirteen students showed up to tryout and, in the end, the coaching staff saw potential in a few of the participants. 

In order to tryout, students filled out a form certifying that they have proper medical insurance, that they are aware of the risk and that they are currently taking 12 credits.

"I admire them for coming out and trying, because a lot of kids talk a good game and then come to games and say they can make it," said men's basketball head coach Sergio Rouco. 

The practice started with laps, then stretching, but quickly moved to conditioning, which was what the coaches were most interested in.  

To determine which students were physically fit, assistant coach Ken Huber had them run what he called "championships," in which the participants had to run the length of the court numerous times in under one minute. Everyone passed this test, which pleasantly surprised the coaching staff. 

After a water break, basketball drills followed with a right- and left-handed lay-up line, a rebound drill, a passing drill and a shooting drill. 

There was also weave passing drill, which proved to be a weakness for most of the participants and was one of only a few things they did not do well. 

After all the running and drills, it came time for the most decisive test: a full court scrimmage. 

Half the participants were given blue practice jerseys and the group was divided into one team of six and another team of seven, rotating with substitutions every four minutes. They played a 5-on-5, 20-minute games. 

Score was not kept, so it's not clear who won, but it looked like a regular 5-on-5 pick-up game, except that the intensity was cracked all the way up because of what was on the line for the players. 

One thing that made it seem like a pick-up game was that none of the 13 participants had a significant height advantage - the tallest player trying out measured 6-2. 

Action in the paint area was a free-for-all, with countless shots getting blocked, stripped and swatted out of bounds. Even in the chaos of 13 guys playing their hardest to have a chance to be a part at playing Division I basketball, there were some standouts. 

Participants were told that the coaches would discuss who they might want for the team and that they would call any players who they would like to have return to take part in team activities. 

"It was a good tryout and it was tough with the running and conditioning, but overall it was good and gave everyone a chance," said Conray Whittier, one of the participants at the tryout. 

Whittier was named by Rouco as someone likely to receive a call inviting him to further team activities. 

"They were in better shape than any group I have had as walk-ons, so they really worked themselves into shape to come out here and not embarrass themselves," Rouco said.

Women's Golf:
On the strength of three Top-20 finishes, the women's golf team finished the UNCG-Starmount Fall Women's Golf Classic in a tie for third place with Elon University. FIU finished behind East Carolina and North Carolina-Greensboro, who finished first and second, respectively, in the tournament held Oct. 16 in Greensboro, N.C..

Junior Susan Nam finished the first day of the tournament in a tie for first place, but ended up in a three-way tie for 6th place overall.

Along with Nam, FIU received strong performances from senior Maria Hernandez, who's 5-over 147 for the tournament landed her in 11th place. She was consistent, with a 2-over on the first day and a 3-over on the second day, finishing just one stroke behind Nam.

Also contributing strongly was freshman Christina Marin, who also finished in the top 20 out of 69 competitors on the strength of a three-stroke improvement on the second day from 5-over to just 2-over. 

Juniors Monica Arreaza and Roberta Neves netted scores of 16-over and 25-over, respectively, finishing 47th and 69th.

The Golden Panthers hit the links again Oct. 29-30 for the 30th annual Pat Bradley Women's Gold Championships at the Pelican Preserve Golf Course in Fort Myers, Fla.

Headline: Receiver's big day proves too much for Golden Panthers
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Returning to the site of their last road victory seemed liked the best place for the FIU Golden Panthers to exorcise the demons that have led them to 19 straight losses. But the Golden Panthers' return to Malone Stadium in Monroe Louisiana, to take on the Sun Belt Conference rival University of Louisiana at Monroe Warhawks on Oct. 20 was anything but an exorcism of demons.

Unfortunately, dropped passes and an inability to convert on 3rd down, an area where they went 5-20, kept the Golden Panthers' losing streak alive and well at 19 games, with a 28-14 loss to drop their record to 0-7 and 0-3 in conference play.

For the second straight week, FIU lead the game at the end of the first quarter, on a 23-yard run by junior Julian Reams, his first rushing touchdown since the 2006 season. Reams led the team in yards per carry, with 11 carries for 55 yards and the touchdown.

"We were more efficient with the ball in the passing game, and we did some good things in the running game," said head coach Mario Cristobal whose career record with the loss was pushed to 0-7.

On the first 2 drives, the Golden Panthers defense was also able to shut down the Warhawks' strong rushing game. They forced a three and out and a forced fumble on a hit by sophomore safety Ashlyn Parker, who patrolled the defensive backfield, laying out punishing hits on any ball carries in his path and racking up a career-high 10 tackles for the converted wide receiver.

However, following a quick change by ULM from freshman quarterback Trey Revell to junior Kinsom Lancaster, the Warhawk offense found it's footing. Lancaster threw for 32 yards on the drive, including a 14-yard touchdown pass to Darrell McNeal to knot the game up at 7-7.

Despite the strong offensive start, the FIU offense slowed up considerably in the second quarter, though freshman quarterback Wayne Younger did amass 66 yards on the ground by halftime, on his way to his third single game QB rushing record of the season with 88 yards on 18 carries.

Lancaster hit McNeal for a touchdown strike again later in the second quarter, this time from three yards out to give ULM a 14-7 lead, one they would not relinquish for the rest of the game. 

FIU had plenty of opportunities to strike back with the long ball, but two plays in the second quarter were particularly difficult to overcome, as freshmen wide receiver Greg Ellingson and running back Trenard Turner both dropped potential game-tying touchdown passes. 

"We had to hit with the long ball, and a couple of times we dropped big plays," Cristobal said.

Despite those two drops, the offense had a couple of chances to get back into the game, including a 42-yard pass from Younger to sophomore receiver Elliot Dix in the third quarter, which would set up a 19-yard pass from Younger to junior wide receiver Zap Hawkins that would bring FIU within a touchdown.

Following that drive, ULM drove the length of the field on the strength of a 29-yard pass from Lancaster to McNeal, a combination that led to 120 yards and two touchdowns. However, the FIU special teams came up big, blocking a kick and getting the Golden Panthers another chance to strike. 

However, Hawkins' touchdown would be the last the offense would be able to manage, and the Warhawks would add another score, this time with McNeal lining up at quarterback and taking the ball into the end zone for a 13-yard score, his third of the game.

"When it's the fourth quarter and you're down by seven and you have the football you should be able to tie the game or put yourself in position to win it," Cristobal said.

This score put the game out of reach, despite a last minute chance by Younger, who's fourth down pass dropped incomplete in the end zone, ending the game and FIU's hopes of ending the streak.

Despite the loss, Cristobal praised his squad for continuing to fight until the last whistle and refused to place blame on anyone, despite another disappointing season that has them fighting just to pick up a win and climb out of the Sun Belt cellar.

"Guys are working their tails off, and there's no shame in the amount of effort being put out here. When you take a loss, you take it as a staff and as a team," he said.

Despite arguably the best game of his career, Parker emphasized what the team must do next week to keep the losing streak at 19.

"There's no consolation there. We've just got to work hard, work on tackling as a defense and come out next week ready to play."
