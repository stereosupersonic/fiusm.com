Headline: SGA vice president gets personal
Author: Julia Sierra / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As the newly elected vice president of the Student Government Association, Christine Denton's number one priority is FIU students. With a busy schedule and tons of responsibility on her shoulders, it is good to stray away from those abundant questions about plans to change the school. 

The Beacon sat down with Denton to discuss her world outside student government and her other leadership role. There is more to her than a fancy title; she has a way of making you feel right at home. 

Q: What do you think about the Miami traffic?

I'm a very passive person, but I usually take out my aggression on the road. I'm a very crazy driver. I'm one of those you probably don't like on the road and you honk at because I'm always swerving. It's weird because in life I'm patient, but not on the road.

Q: Your nickname is B.E.E. What does it stand for?

OK, that's a complicated one. We [sororities] usually don't mention nicknames because they're usually personal or inside jokes that don't make sense to anyone else. Let's just say it's an acronym that has to do with me being too nice and needing to become ... more assertive in my endeavors; that's putting it in a nice way. If you really want to know, you can always find me in my office.

Q: Your favorite music includes country and the '80s. Why do you like those two genres in particular?

Oh, wow. It's funny, because before college I would never even listen to country or '80s music. I think that college has broadened my horizons and given me opportunities to venture into new interests. 
Don't get me wrong, I don't listen to the old-school country, like "YEE HAW!" But for anyone who doesn't like country, I challenge you all to my new favorite song - "Making Memories of Us," by Keith Urban, maybe it will spark an interest.

Q: On your Facebook profile it states that you believe everything happens for a reason. Where does that stem from and how has it changed some of your perspectives on life (if at all)?

It stems from my faith in God. I believe that God has a bigger plan for us; I'm not quick to assume that God simply allows bad things to happen without knowing the consequences and how it will affect me and make me feel. I know that He will not give me something that I cannot handle. I just have to trust that He will guide me through whatever challenges I may face. 

Living by this helps me to accept things a lot easier. Like the well-known quote says, "Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference."

Q: I noticed that you are a nursing major. How is this career faring so far?

Actually, I have recently changed my major which may be a shock to many, especially all the nursing students who were very supportive during the campaign. This was a very hard decision to make, having studied nursing for three years. As many college students can attest, you cannot pursue a degree in a field that you are not 100 percent passionate about - at least not without regret. Nursing is a very prestigious profession and I look up to everyone who perseveres in that career path. 

Unfortunately, it was not the path for me. People's lives are in my hands as a nurse; you just can't have any doubts about it.

Q: What are your plans in regards to your new major now?

I've always been passionate about psychology, although I am interested in health service administration. So I'm finishing psychology and will graduate next spring. Then, I'll go for my master's in health service administration.

Q: What helps you deal with the stress of your studies and involvement at FIU?

Between elections, changing my major and being president of my sorority, stress was definitely inevitable. I like listening to music, going to the gym when I have time, being around friends or simply sleeping. I'm always on the go, so any break is good. I've learned through all my involvements that I need time for myself and I do know when to step aside and take time off.

Q: What did you find most enjoyable while you and Alex Prado were campaigning?

Honestly, meeting so many different people who unfortunately had certain predispositions about voting and student government, but then changing their minds after a sincere conversation and convincing them how important a student's vote can be. 

Also, students actually believed they really could make a difference. Oh, and I have to add: at the end of the day it was great when someone would pass by and say, "I voted for you!" It motivated me to keep going.

Q: In what area has it been particularly difficult for you?

OK, well, Alex and I are very privileged with a lot of power in our position, but we are still limited when it comes to meeting every single student's needs. It's not to say we're not working on our platform, but there's only so much that can be done in a year's time. It frustrated me a lot, but I finally came to terms with the fact that it is impossible to meet every single person's need. 

However, as long as Alex and I do our best to accomplish our goals, we'll set the precedent for the following year in hopes that [our successors] will keep adding to our vision. Everyone wants to be Superman, right? But it's hard.

Q: How do you feel, being a woman with a leadership role in today's world?

I want to word this correctly. I don't want men to be like, "Whoa, watch out!" Well, I have a quote that came to mind when you asked this; it's by Margaret Thatcher. She said, "Being powerful is like being a lady. If you have to say you are, then you are not." I'm very big on humility and knowing where I came from; so I'm not one to brag about being in an authoritative position as a woman. I hope I can motivate and encourage other women in our university to realize their full potential, whether it's through leadership or their individual talent.

Q: You're very involved in your sorority; what are some of your responsibilities as president of Alpha Xi Delta.

I'll just say ... what are not my responsibilities? 

As president, I oversee almost everything. I have to deal with not only the internal workings of the organization, but all external as well, including the university issues. And I just want to add, that it's a job - but it's my sanity in many ways - and it's a job that I love.

Q: Can you tell us about Dance Marathon and the kind of experience it was?

Our sorority was extremely involved in Dance Marathon. We won the Miracle Cup, which is awarded to the organization that raises the most money; we had seven morale captains; A Xi D [our sorority] had overall director and assistant director, as well as several committee members. 

It was just encouraging to be there for 25 hours dancing and surrounded by friends that you like to be with for that long. People who are practically like family and would pump me up at three in the morning when all I wanted to do was sleep. 

I think that the most touching part was when the families of children with diseases came by and thanked us for raising money for them; for making it possible for other kids to survive their illness  - through research and support - because of student donations.

Q: What have you learned from your sisters throughout the years you've been a part of A Xi D?

I think, definitely, what I've gained the most and learned from my sisters is the confidence in knowing that I can do something if I put my mind to it. If I ever had doubts about my abilities to achieve something, my sisters never allowed me to consider giving up; it was not an option. Without their faith in me, I believe I would not be where I'm at today.

Q: Do you have any last words of encouragement you'd like to share with your fellow FIU students before we go?

Don't be in such a rush to get out into the real world. Of course, you have to eventually graduate, but college life is short and it should be the greatest time of your life. Enjoy it!

Headline: Fraternity organizations prepare for upcoming recruitment week
Author: Cyntianna Ledesma / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
One may have noticed groups of guys in and around the Graham Center of the University Park campus proudly passing out flyers, while wearing colored jerseys. The reason is that the first day of fraternity recruitment week begins on July 11.  

This week is dedicated to introducing distinguished fraternity organizations on campus to the FIU community and to potential men interested in joining a brotherhood. Within a one-week span, fraternity brothers will have a chance to meet potential brothers and vice-versa. The best way to learn about each fraternity is to attend these events, so pick up those flyers and find out what is going on in each fraternity this week. 

The following fraternities are represented on campus: Alpha Epsilon Pi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji), Delta Lambda Phi, Phi Sigma Kappa, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Tau Kappa Epsilon.  

"Visit as many organizations as you can," said Juan D'Arce, recruitment chair for FIJI. "Find out what each fraternity's purpose is." 

It is stressed that each potential member get to know each fraternity's value system, what the members stand for and what they do throughout the semester. That is why a whole week is dedicated to the recruitment process. Each fraternity also has its own set of requirements and scholarship opportunities. Generally, fraternities require a 2.5 GPA, but some may be higher. More information is discussed further when potential members meet with the organizations.

One may ask how all 200 potential brothers will meet all nine organizations, but each organization will host social parties each day of the week that will give the potential member a chance to talk one-on-one with brothers of the fraternities. These fun social parties range from Phi Gamma Delta's (FIJI) "Casino Night-Havana Style" or Lambda Chi Alpha's "Pool Night at Billiards."  

Approximately 200-250 potential members will be recruited this summer. A second recruitment week occurs in the fall during the week of September 12, where a higher number of recruits are expected.

As important as it is to create friendships within these parties, behavior is always important.  

"Know when to act up and when to be professional," D'Arce said. "Our mission is for each brother to find someone to replace [himself], so our values just keep getting stronger."  

Each fraternity is excited to meet new men in an effort to recruit them to join their distinguished group. 

"Our fraternity's mission is to perform second to no one," said Richard Alvarez, a member of Lambda Chi Alpha. And just like these brothers, potential members also show their enthusiasm to find the organization that best fits them. 

"My expectations for being a brother are to have a group of friends that are solid. Not many people can and want to rush, but I see this as an opportunity to have a bond with thousands of people around the world," said Daniel Herrera, potential fraternity member.

Headline: Mark Haddon's heart-warming tale of a misfit deemed a satisfying read
Author: Arlene Garcia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Christopher Boone is an eccentric fifteen-year-old that loves math and physics, hates the colors yellow and brown and is obsessed with prime numbers. One day, Christopher mysteriously finds Wellington, a neighbor's dog, dead with a pitch fork stuck through its body. The streets are deserted and there is not one clue left as to who could have murdered the dog. 

After a few moments, the boy is found standing over Wellington by the dog's owner, Mrs. Shears. She wrongly accuses Chris of killing Wellington and calls the police. 

However, after a quick interrogation, the police let Christopher go with simply a warning. Nevertheless, Chris finds it hard to get the incident out of his mind. The young man decided to become just like Sherlock Holmes and investigate what happened to Wellington.

Unquestionably, Christopher is quite an unusual young man. First of all, he does not like to be touched and does not understand human emotions very well. He thinks that, "all the other children in [his] school are stupid (Haddon, 43)" and does not understand jokes. 

His eccentricities are as odd as they are entertaining. The boy has grown up with his father who has patiently endured his weird ways through the years. They have a very close relationship - until Christopher not only discovers what happened to Wellington, but also the secrets his father was keeping about his mother.

The novel is excellent and satisfying. It is strangely sad and deeply moving. But it is also so amusing, it can be read in one sitting. 

Christopher will keep everyone guessing and when the truth is revealed, readers will be completely surprised! 

The novel is fun to read and there is some beauty in experiencing the world through the eyes of a boy that has no understanding of humanity. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is funny, unique and genuinely clever.

Headline: Live 8 concerts target world leaders in the name of Africa
Author: Michelle Santisteban
&nbsp;
No matter where one is, no matter what language one speaks, music has a way of transcending all barriers and connecting the whole world through that common bond. With a powerful medium such as music, it is not difficult to bring a message across the world in effort to raise awareness about a special cause. This is what made the Live 8 concerts on July 2 so successful. 

With eight concerts staged around the world in places like Paris, Rome, Philadelphia and London, all with big name acts, the Live 8 concerts were able to reach the world and educate billions of people about their cause.  
Unlike the original Live Aid concerts held in 1985 to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia, the Live 8 concerts were held to raise awareness - not money, about the plight of the world's poor people, mainly focusing on Africa. 

The concerts also served the purpose of letting the G8, a meeting of the world's most powerful leaders that take place from July 6 - 9, know that the world is aware of the issues that need to be dealt with, such as poverty and the AIDS epidemic in Africa, and urge them to take action.  
Many big names in music participated in the Live 8 concerts. In London, artists such as, Madonna, Elton John, Pink Floyd, and Paul McCartney shared the stage with new comer acts like The Killers, Keane and Coldplay. 

In Philadelphia, Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, Maroon 5, Bon Jovi and Keith Urban helped round out the very eclectic set list. Many artists from different genres came together to support one cause and invited all kinds of people to watch the concerts, thus capturing the world's attention.  

One of the most memorable moments during the London concert was when the members of Pink Floyd reunited after over 20 years and took the stage. Mariah Carey also added some diversity to the London stage when she sang with the African Children's Choir. 

State side, another memorable moment occurred when Rob Thomas joined Stevie Wonder to sing some of Wonder's classic tunes - much to the delight of the audience. 

Though many would argue that the Live 8 concerts would have been more effective if money were raised instead of awareness, the Live 8 website argues that "Live 8 is about justice not charity." 

If money would have been raised to help the nations in poverty, it would have helped for the time being but to truly bring change, the whole world must act as one in order to pull these poor, under-developed countries out of poverty and sickness once and for all. Without the attention and long term help of the world's powerful leaders, none of this is possible. 

With the help of music, the Live 8 concerts were successful in bringing us all together and letting us know that money does count, but our collective voice can bring about more change than any amount of cash.

1. 7-ELEVEN SLURPEES
There is nothing more refreshing than drinking a 7-Eleven Slurpee on a hot summer day. Next time you spot a 7-Eleven store, pour yourself a Slurpee and dunk in a straw. You'll be in total bliss, but watch out for the BRAIN FREEZE! 

2. JAMES PATTERSON NOVELS
My fascination with his writing started when I was about to board on a plane. I grabbed a Snickers bar and the first paperback I saw at one of those small stores in the airport. I quickly lost myself in the book and before I knew it, my plane had already landed.

3. WALT DISNEY WORLD
    It's the only magical place on earth where you won't get arrested for wearing Mickey Mouse ears and skipping up and down Main Street USA singing "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah." If you haven't done that already, you don't know what you're missing.		

4. REALITY SHOWS
    Am I the only one who is still addicted to them? So many people say they're sick and tired of reality shows, but I just can't seem to get enough. Since the first "Survivor" and "The Real World" episodes, I've been a reality show junkie. I admit it! No need for an "Intervention" (that's a reality show, too).

5. MIAMI
 Powered by the energy and influence of the Caribbean beat, Miami means big-city elegance and alluring beaches to those who seek its unique brand of electric charge. Besides, where else can you have a café con leche and a Jamaican patty for breakfast while overlooking the Atlantic Ocean?

Headline: Biscayne Landings impacts campus
Author: Chester Robards / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Biscayne Bay Campus will be welcoming 6,000 new neighbors in the next several years. 

Biscayne Landing, "a master planned community," as the sign in front of the construction site reads, is currently under construction a few hundred feet from the campus, on a plot of land stretching from Northeast 137 Street to Northeast 151 Street.

Biscayne Landing held a ground-breaking ceremony and commemorative luncheon June 9.

Since the opening of the Biscayne Landing site and the start of construction of a kindergarten through eighth grade public school and charter high school, trucks have congested the usually loose traffic on BBC's NE 151 Street entrance.

"Before, you could breeze through [the street] without having to stop. Lately, with the construction you've had to wait," said Erika Arrazacaeta,  majoring in broadcast journalism.

BBC  Provost Raul Moncarz is also concerned about the flow of traffic through 151 Street, especially for future students. He suggests opening alternative routes like the  construction entrance on Northeast 143 Street and an existing road on Northeast 135 Street that connects to the campus, but they have yet to be approved for use by the City of North Miami.

Over the next two years, construction crews will work on Buildings One and Two, located in the northeast corner of the site (the area closest to Northeast 151 Street), BBC's only entrance.

With the charter high school in the plans for construction next to the North Miami Athletic Stadium, the future remodeling of Northeast 151 Street is on the drawing board table.

Bridges and bicycle paths could form the future entrance to FIU for pedestrians.

"We have presented a concept to the county," said William Wallace IV, vice president of development at Biscayne Landing.

Concerns about traffic are not the only things that have come into question - the strange odors in the Biscayne Bay area are also of high concern.

"We have employed consultants that deal with nuisance odors," said Herb Tillman, director of construction and land development for Biscayne Landing. "Most odors occur from the mangroves."

Representatives from FIU were disappointed that the school was not sufficiently credited by the developers, but have contacted developers of Biscayne Landing concerning funding for the building of a new marine biology dock.

In addition to the dock, FIU has also requested an endowment for the College of Education, guest lecture series and a performing arts complex.

The charter high school is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2006, on 136,000 square feet of land east of the North Miami Athletic Stadium. It will house 1600 students. The school will focus on environmental science and marine biology. 

There are hopes that the school's administration will implement a magnet program in journalism. 

FIU faculty will assist in developing the guidelines and standards for the school.

Professors are looking forward to the school's environmental science program.

"We're [most] interested in having a charter school with some kind of environmental program," said Joel Heinen, associate professor and chair of Environmental Studies.

Also in the works is a nature center to conduct environmental research at the Biscayne Landing. FIU has a soil scientist involved with development projects. There are  plans to set aside funding for environmental studies and graduate students plan on participating in the program.

Furthermore, there are plans to build a hotel near the compound and possibly using the Kovens Center as the hotel's convention center.

"This will draw more attention to [Biscayne Landings], which sometimes I think is the stepchild of the university system, and make Tamiami aware that more money [can be spent] on the campus," said Kevin Burns, mayor of the City of North Miami.

Headline: University and Red Cross serve evacuees
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
As Hurricane Dennis approached the shores of the Florida Keys on July 7, residents were forced to evacuate to FIU - the nearest hurricane shelter.

Evacuees occupied the Pharmed Arena during the first night but were later moved into Primera Casa, the official center for Monroe County evacuees.

The American Red Cross served very few people on the first night but in a matter of hours on the second day, more residents flocked through the doors.

"At the beginning of the day we had four people and within 30 minutes we had over 50," said Erika Mayor, communications director for the Red Cross.

On the second floor of PC, nurses and doctors were on hand to care for people with special needs - the third and fourth floors where open to the general public. Floors were divided into family, individual, female and male only areas. 

There is no definite count of the amount of persons PC can occupy but on average, 20 square feet per person of the building is reserved for the general public and 40 square feet for people with special needs. The ratio changes depending on whether or not PC is holding evacuees before and or after the event. 

With her second time evacuating at FIU, Jan Allison brought board games, cards and books to stay entertained.

"I've been here once before and we [would] much rather be in a hotel but you take what you can get," said Allison, who was staying with her son and daughter.

Allison's family got adjusted with blankets and pillows while she explained her preparations for the hurricane.

"We put shutters up, and had to leave everything in storage. We had to leave our pet [cat] there because there was no pet shelter," Allison said.

The American Red Cross provided food, snacks and water for the evacuees. In addition, the Red Cross can provide casework in the event of people needing mental health counseling.

"The Red Cross is happy to be able to help the residents and visitors of Monroe County - this is what we live for," Mayor said.

Although it might not be the most comfortable place, some evacuees were grateful for being able to stay at PC.

"I would like to thank FIU for all the help they provided to assist the homeless and those who were in need," said evacuee Bon Marche Carpenter.

The shelter is provided free of cost for Monroe Country residents by the Red Cross.

"We are very thankful that FIU allows us to be in this building but it does cost money for the Red Cross to be in this building. During the 2004 hurricane season, it cost over $150,000 for shelter and meals, not just FIU, it's any Miami Dade Public School [shelter] we open," Mayor said. 

"We pay rent for their utilities, their janitorial services, and police. Last year, we prepared for four storms, that's over thousands of dollars per day."

Plans to relocate classes were made ahead of time - classes were moved to various buildings throughout the University Park campus. 

"We did everything we could to find rooms for students. Our focus was [making] this happen while ensuring that students can attend class with minimal interruptions," said Jennifer Mwaisela, assistant vice president of Environmental Health Safety.

Anyone wishing to donate to the Red Cross can contact 305-644-1300 for more information.

Headline: Shuttle bus price ticket increased by 25 cents
Author: Damian Grass / Asst. News Editor
&nbsp;
Students will have to dig deeper into their pockets for an extra 50 cents the next time they ride on the Golden Panther Express Shuttle for a round trip.

Effective July 1, the new $3 round-trip fee to and from the University Park campus and the Biscayne Bay Campus comes after a 2004 report from 7871 Bus Lines, the company that provides the busses. The report shows the service operated at a staggering cost of $500,000 in 2004. 

"The tickets that were sold to the passengers offset that cost by less than $200,000.  This nominal 25 cent increase per one way ride will go toward a further offset of this cost," said Bill Foster, director of parking and transportation.

After a plea to the fee committee to raise the student fees in an effort to help cover the remaining cost was denied, the Department of Parking and Transportation had to come up with the difference by raising their rates. 

"Because of the budget costs that the university is continually incurring," Foster said, "we will also be continuing to look into other alternative funding options, since this $250,000 plus annual cost to the university is becoming more and more difficult."

Foster and his team will turn to the Student Government Association, the department of Parking and Traffic and student involvement for help.
Many students who use the shuttle service see the new fee increase as a surprise, but expected.

"I knew it was going to happen. The school is increasing fees everywhere and it was just a matter of time," said junior Lourdes Gonzalez.

Marcus Dowers, a senior who currently attends summer classes at both campuses, is considering his options. 

"I was trying to see if I was better off taking the shuttle instead of driving my car back and forth every week. But now with this increase, I don't think it's [still] economical," said Dowers.

For other students like junior Christine Guzman, an increase in tuition would have been a more affordable solution.

"They should have just increased tuition by $10 to $15 a semester per student instead of increasing the shuttle fee," Guzman said. "In the long term, this may have been cheaper for students and more profitable for the university."

Tickets at UP are sold in the Blue Garage. At BBC, tickets are sold at the Wolfe University Center Information Desk.

Headline: Deadly rush-hour bombings shake up London
Author: Damian Grass / Asst. News Editor
&nbsp;
Terror struck the heart of London July 7 when explosions ripped through three subway trains and blasted the roof off a crowded red double-decker bus during the morning rush just outside the financial district. 

At least 37 people were killed and more than 700 have been wounded so far, making it the deadliest attack on the city since World War II.

According to the Associated Press, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the bombings were designed to coincide with the opening of the G-8 summit in Scotland. Although Blair blamed Islamic extremists, he cautioned that they speak for only a small percentage of Muslims.

"We know that these people act in the name of Islam, but we also know that the vast and overwhelming majority of Muslims here and abroad are decent and law-abiding, who abhor this act of terrorism every bit as much as we do," Blair said.

Headline: Discrepancies found at both FIU campuses prove equality is not found between locations
Author: Editorial
&nbsp;
In theory, we are supposed to be one campus, yet in so many ways, we are not. The university, at times, seems like a paradox of sorts. 

Sometimes we are FIU - University Park campus and FIU - Biscayne Bay Campus and other times, we are simply FIU. This distinction seems to happen frequently and when economically convenient.  Thus, we presently find that we have become two different campuses. 

Having two different campuses with different sets of services, within the same facilities only hurt us. The point of higher education is to help us to create unity among its students. Separation in the services that govern each campus can only build division among its students due to limited ability to move freely from campus to campus. This restricted ability to commute between campuses is often due to fees on services, which should already be included in our tuition expenses to begin with. Fees such as the transit bus fare, which recently was increased by 25 cents, now makes it more expensive for students to commute within campuses.
 
A possible solution to shuttle increase would be to have students, from both campuses, be able to board the bus by simply flashing their student ID without having to pay a dime at the moment - because FIU would have already included an increase per semester in student fees. This would make things easier for students and faculty. 

The fact that two different shuttles depart from both campuses within a short time - a span of ten minutes or less, is a significant waste of money and labor. The first bus of each hour leaves mostly packed and the second carries a maximum of ten people, if even that many. 

Unfortunately, students must suffer the ticket increase in order to suffice a bus carrying less than the amount needed to travel.

The most mind-boggling disparity is why we have two Student Government Associations with two different presidents and vice-presidents. Couldn't we do with just one SGA for the whole university?

There is a pharmacy for students at UP but none at BBC. There should be a wider range of food providers with extended hours offered at BBC like there is at UP. The quality and quantity of the UP library is also much better at UP than at BBC.

UP and BBC should not be two different entities under the same name and we should be able to go between campuses freely without worrying that everything is different in each campus. President Modesto Maidique has said various times that we are "one" school and yet as the days pass, it seems like we are in reality two. If we can't stand united as one school, then we are destined to fail.

I like to pray and I like to pray often. However, when I pray, I do it silently and alone - be it before an exam that I've already taken twice or before daring to eat at the University Park cafeteria. 

Still, there are times when I want to forget social conventions, drop to my knees,  be alone and meditate like when my mother tells me her health isn't improving or when friends get into problems I can't help them out of.

Because I live on campus, finding the time and space for that needed meditation tends to be a difficult chore, what with room mates in the residence halls and students swarming around the university at all hours of the day. 

In Gainesville, I once visited a chapel built for its students by the University of Florida. It was a tiny structure surrounded by the reeds of a nearby marsh and decorated with a non-religious stained glass window that illuminated the benches in the morning light.

When I go searching for a private prayer spot, I remember that building and realize that there is nothing resembling that at either of FIU's campuses. 

The closest thing UP has to a student prayer room is the FIU Center in St. Agatha's church across the 107th Ave. entrance, but this is a special Catholic service catering primarily to students who adhere to that religion.

We have a newly completed gym, a soon to be completed museum and the foundations of another residence hall, but no chapel?

With the expectations and pressures developed by students in college, especially when just entering the university life, a special building set aside for prayer, contemplation or just quiet relaxation would not go unappreciated.

A small place in a much bigger one where the real world is blocked out, where negative energy can be released.

In a poll conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California-Los Angeles, 69 percent of 100,000 students from different colleges and religious backgrounds stated that their religious beliefs "provide strength, support and guidance" in their lives.

A non-denominational and non-sectarian chapel on either UP or the Biscayne Bay Campus could provide the space needed for students to express those various beliefs in a safe and protected setting.

This would be a room for reflection that welcomes all students, whether they be counting the beads of a rosary, prostrating themselves towards Mecca, reciting the Orthodox Jewish morning prayers or simply trying to find peace in the middle of an unsavory day. 

A prayer room would provide solace in our hectic world.

Headline: Baseball camp teaches more than the basics
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
A group of adolescents wielding bats and throwing balls isn't exactly something most people would want to be around. But for Chris Holick and his staff, this type of situation is nothing new.

Every summer, from the end of the FIU baseball season until the beginning of August, Holick is in charge of running the Golden Panther Baseball camps. The camps run Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the baseball stadium at the University Park Campus and are open to kids of all baseball levels from ages 5 to 18.

Holick is also an assistant coach on the FIU baseball team and is responsible for its hitters and catchers, as well as assisting with the infielders and strength and conditioning. It is these same responsibilities that Holick holds as director of the camps.

"We go through every single form of baseball drill - from base running, sliding, hitting, bunting, throwing mechanics, infield [and] outfield play," Holick said.

For the camper who aspires to take the mound, there are pitching drills - such as mechanics and fielding. Arm strengthening exercises and run bullpen sessions, where the camper's pitches are clocked with a radar gun, are also taught.

Other activities include a game at the end of each day and, on Fridays, there is a barbeque and a homerun derby. 

And because the stadium facilities include an indoor hitting facility, a weight room and club house, the camps can go on even if it's raining.
According to Holick, the camps average between 50 and 70 participants each week. That many kids requires a lot of help, which is why the camp has one volunteer counselor - usually a current or former FIU baseball player for every five campers.

"For the most part, the kids are well-behaved. I think it's because they want to learn new things about baseball and other things," said counselor Frank Gonzalez, who is also a relief pitcher on the baseball team.

Overall, the campers were very positive regarding their experience and liked certain aspects of the camps.

"You get a lot of individual training from the coaches and [the other staff members]," said 15 year-old Christopher Argote. "You get training you don't normally get in high school or in other leagues."

But not everything is perfect.

"The only thing I don't like about the camp is that you have to pay for sodas," said 14 year-old Louis Espindola jokingly.

Even though it is a baseball camp, there are other things greater than baseball that the camp wants its campers to learn.

"The biggest thing about it is we try to develop life skills for the kids to get them to feel confident about themselves," Holick said. "With that confidence, we prepare them for game situations and communications. 

So, they're not just learning baseball skills here. They're learning to communicate with other kids, they're having a good time doing it and they're doing it in a positive atmosphere."

Headline: Major League All-Star Game superior to those of other pro leagues
Subheadline: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Every major sport in the United States advertise their All-Star Game the same way: It's for the fans.

But while leaves the NBA and NFL like basketball and football rely on the new hip-hop generation or a tropical location like Hawaii, Major League Baseball has time-honored tradition and a rich history on its side.

Like the NBA and NFL, baseball's All-Star Game has provided its fair share of game-shaking moments and crowd-pleasing spectacles.

But unlike the others, MLB's All-Star Game has kept its respect and further added to its importance throughout the years, while the others have lost their value. 

For over two decades now, the NBA has dedicated an entire weekend to its All-Star game.  

Leading up to the game, some of its players take part in a Slam Dunk Competition and a Three-Point Shootout.

This used to be a great way to lead up to the actual game as the NBA's elite players really got a chance to show off their skills.

But those times have been lost throughout the years and it seems as if the event becomes less attractive every year.

What used to be Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins, at the prime of their careers, fiercely competing, has become a McDonalds All-American Game with guys like Josh Smith and Fred Jones - barely recognized on their own teams - taking part.

The real competition for all these no-name young guns, who can do a 360 dunk in an open gym, should be a twelve-foot jumpshot contest. That aught to be interesting.

While the NBA's festivities seemed to have lost their edge, Major League Baseball's Home Run Derby has stayed consistent throughout time.

Rarely do we watch a Homerun Derby and not recognize every player competing. That's what fans want to see.

They don't want to see first or second year players that come off the bench taking part.  They want to see their idols, the guys whose faces they recognize, join in.

This is not a problem with management in the NBA, but a problem with its players.  Every year the league invites the top players to take part and every year the excuses pile up.

These NBA players need to stop being such crybabies and for once pay their dues to the fans that pay for their big-time salaries.

There is no doubt that football is a beloved game in America, but even the NFL outweighed itself in deciding to make the Pro Bowl at the end of the season.

Maybe it makes sense from a player's standpoint because they don't have to think about a "meaningless game" in the middle of the season and worry about getting hurt, but it sure doesn't catch viewers' attention.

The Pro Bowl has become a very outdated event that has struggled to become famous and whose fan base has turned away from it.

Instead of drawing the attention of its followers, Pro Bowl has caught the attention of middle-aged soccer moms that flip it on at halftime to watch Janet Jackson or Gloria Estefan perform.

To the average football fan, the season ends when the Vince Lombardi trophy is handed out.  After that, fans have had their 20 weeks of football and called it a season.

Nobody is interested in watching a Pro Bowl with guys that are busier getting tans and learning how to body surf rather than playing football.

At this point, the aggravation of another losing season and the disappointment of some of its players has settled in. It is not time to celebrate the game, but to try and forget about it until next fall comes around.

An All-Star Game in the middle of the season catches fans with glimmers of hope and an increasing interest in the season.  

It reaches their highest or lowest points, when the eagerness of football has died out.

For the second year in a row, the All-Star Game will decide who gets home field advantage in the World Series.

Homefield advantage is  important, so players are no longer just trying to bring their kids to the game and get reunited with old teammates, they now have the incentive to win.

This year the Home Run Derby will go a little bit different. Instead of hitting for their respected leagues, players will be representing their countries to further promote the World Cup of Baseball (a plan proposed by Bud Selig - who will announce whether or not the deal will pass at the All-Star Game - where teams from all over the world will compete for one championship).

So as this year's Major League Baseball All-Star Game comes our way from the Detroit Tigers' Comerica Park, don't expect to see a lot of the usual All-Star game antics.

Allen Iverson won't be doing crossovers, Vince Carter won't be bouncing balls off the backboard and quarterbacks won't be telling their receivers "just try to get open."

What you will see is good, hard-nosed baseball played in the purest sense of the word.  Quite frankly, we wouldn't have it any other way.

Headline: London a surprise winner over Paris for Olympics
Author: Philip Hersh / Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
SINGAPORE -- Daley Thompson was ready. The two-time Olympic decathlon champion was wearing a red T-shirt he had commissioned two weeks ago, and the message on its back summed up almost perfectly how London had become the host city of the 2012 Summer Olympics.

"Seb and Co," the shirt read, "putting the Great back in Britain."

One more letter, an "e" after the "Co," and Thompson's shirt would have echoed what many of the International Olympic Committee members felt about the result of their Wednesday vote giving Great Britain its first Olympic Games since 1948.

Thompson's former British teammate Sebastian Coe, a two-time Olympic champion in track and field as well, had won a third gold medal in the eyes of IOC member Mario Pescante of Italy.

"This is the victory of Sebastian Coe," Pescante said.

In a decision requiring the maximum number of ballot rounds before one of the five candidates received the necessary majority, London defeated Paris, long considered the favorite, by a 54-50 margin on the decisive ballot. That meant Paris had failed in an Olympic bid for the third time in 20 years.

Moscow was eliminated in the first round, New York in the second and Madrid in the third.

"One difference between the London bid and the others was London was headed by a world-class athlete, and in a close race that may have played a role," said IOC member Arne Ljungqvist of Sweden. "But it cannot be just any athlete _ it has to be someone like him."

Coe, 48, a member of the House of Lords and a former member of Parliament, proved as impressive in leading the London bid as he had been in running the metric mile at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics. He gave London a dimension none of the other finalists could match.

"This is almost an entirely different planet," Coe said when asked to compare Wednesday's triumph to his gold medals. His achievement was similar to what alpine skiing legend Jean-Claude Killy had done as leader of Albertville, France's successful bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics.

Coe's eloquence in stating London's case blended with images of him as an athlete to create an aura that proved captivating in IOC members' minds eyes.

"You remember him running the 1,500 meters, and you don't have to say anything more. That is inspiring enough," said IOC member Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. of Spain, part of the bid team for Madrid, which had led the second round.

London focused much of its hour-long final presentation to the IOC members Wednesday on a vision of having the Olympics promote healthier lives by inspiring young people around the world to participate in sport.

"We can no longer take it for granted young people will choose sport," Coe said. "Some may lack the facilities or the coaches and role models to teach them. Others, in an age of 24-hour entertainment and instant fame, may simply lack the desire."

A poignant video showing four children morph into champions after watching an Olympics on TV came alive when Coe described how that very experience in 1968 had led him, at age 12, to take up running.

"On behalf of the youth of today, the athletes of tomorrow and the Olympians of the future, we humbly submit the bid of London 2012," Coe said, in the final words of London's presentation.

To back its vision, London's bid includes transforming a run-down part of east London into a park that will be the site of nine sports and the Olympic Village during the Games and leave a legacy of facilities and green space to the city. Questions about the political will to carry through such a plan were eased by the presence of Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Essar Gabriel, deputy CEO of the Paris bid team, gave London credit for convincing the IOC that its Olympic project-more expensive and more potentially problematic than the French plan-was viable.

"Seb reminded the IOC they had made daring decisions before," Gabriel said.

In trying not to jeopardize its position as favorite, an idea reinforced by the glowing report the IOC bid city evaluation commission issued last month, the Paris bid wound up emphasizing little but the city's appeal as a tourist destination. The French seemed to mock the Olympic ideal of bringing diverse people together by having only white men speak during their final presentation.

Paris did not lead the voting in any round and finished third of the four in the second round.
"There is nothing I think we could have done better," Gabriel said.
Coe knew London had a lot to improve when he took over the bid committee from American businesswoman Barbara Cassani. Cassani stepped down May 19, 2004, a day after the IOC reduced the original group of nine candidates to five.

At that time, the IOC also pointed out the London bid's serious deficiencies in transportation, distances between venues and lack of public support. That became a template for change.

London still had relatively low public support for its bid, 67 percent in a poll the IOC commissioned last winter. But it revised its venue plan, moving a couple sports from outlying areas to the Olympic park, and it convinced the IOC evaluation commission that a subway system the IOC had branded "obsolete" 14 months ago could be upgraded to handle Olympic transport needs.

In the end, swaying the hearts of IOC members may have proved more significant than swaying their minds.

Said IOC president Jacques Rogge, who does not vote in host city elections: "I was very touched by the message we had to reach for the youth of the world."

Seb Coe didn't need to put on new clothes to spell out that point. He was wearing it on his shirtsleeve all along.

Headline: FIU Police

I was just wondering if "The Beacon" was planning to look into the allegations that an FIU policeman, while on duty at FIU, allegedly raped a woman across from the FIU University Park Campus.  I was speaking with a friend of mine who works for FIU and she was stating how FIU can not investigate this until Miami Dade finishes their own investication.  This is one thing, but she was also under the impression that FIU has no control over who works for their own police force because we are a State school and therefore state police are simply assigned to us and FIU has no power to fire or hire the very people they have protecting their school.  However, I was reading the article in the Miami Herald about this attack to which they stated, "Riordan said Currie [the officer accused], who was hired by the campus police department in December 1996, was twice fired in connection with off-campus, off-duty criminal charges. Riordan did not have access to the specific dates of the firings."  Now my question is if FIU police have the power to fire, do they not have the power to hire?  And why on Earth would FIU police be re-hiring someone who twice faced criminal charges?  And after this attack on a women practically 10 feet from FIU campus, while the cop was on duty no less, can they not fire him now.  I mean, even though he has not been found guilty yet I would like to think that after firing this officer twice, and rehiring him for no reason which I will ever grasp, and now having new charges of rape being brought up, which allegedly occured across campus while this officer was supposed to be protecting and watching out for FIU students and staff, that they would have the sense to fire him.  

On a side not, how safe is FIU?  Have you ever walked around FIU at night with half its lights out.  Given any night, that I have in the past walked through FIU, I would say that at least half the lights guiding the sidewalks are always out.  Not to mention the empty police cars protecting the students on campus.  How can they possibly think an empty police car is going to keep students from shooting other students in the Panther Hall parking lot, or keep people from being held up at gunpoint in CP late at night, or keep a housing students car from being set on fire?  Especially since all of these things have already happened in the last 4 years I've been living on FIU campus.
