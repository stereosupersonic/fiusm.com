Headline: Food and Wine Festival coming to town

&nbsp;
Wine, spirits, scotch and sake tasting isn't even half of what the Sixth Annual Food Network's South Beach Food and Wine Festival will offer.

Cooking classes with the nation's most renowned chefs and culinary personalities, and a golf tournament at the Biltmore Hotel Country Club are other events that have helped make this event so popular.

From Feb. 21 to Feb. 24, about 100 restaurants and 55 food and beverage distributors will be exhibiting their work on Ocean Drive and 13th Street in Miami Beach.

"It's the largest food and wine festival in the nation," said Randall Rubin, an FIU graduate from the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management and current hospitality and management professor  at FIU, who has volunteered at the event for the past five years.

Last year, he was put in charge of the Restaurant and Exhibitor Program where he trained and helped exhibitors prepare their stations at the Grand Tasting event.

"The Grand Tasting event is the largest of all events held that weekend. It usually sells out fast and about 8,000 to 12,000 people show up," Rubin said.

Local and nationally known restaurants as well as wine and spirits distributors will be offering their very best. Food, liquor and wine will be at each guests' disposal from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Feb. 24 to Feb. 25. The cost will be $137.50 plus tax.

Children will also be catered to during this weekend.

Kellogg's Kidz Kitchen, a  one hour interactive program that will include juice tasting and cooking classes, will be held in Lummus Park Feb. 24 to Feb. 25 at various times throughout the day for $35 (plus tax and service fee) per child.

But the Food Network's South Beach Food and Wine Festival has undergone some changes over the years, both moving and growing.

In 2000, it was known as Florida Extravaganza, a one-day event that took place at FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus and showcased both national and international wineries and local restaurants.

In 2002, Brian Lee Schrager, director of special events and media relations at Southern Wine & Spirits of America gave the event a make over; he moved it to Ocean Drive on South Beach and named it the South Beach Food and Wine Festival.

For the 2007 festival, the Food Network partnered with the South Beach Food and Wine Festival and became its title sponsor.

"It's a great place to network," said Karen Ramone, a senior majoring in hospitality management. "I get to meet restaurant owners and other professionals."

Students volunteering for the first time are looking forward to the event.

"I'm very excited to be participating in such a big event. I've programmed small galas and corporate events in the past. This festival is a lot more work, " said first year volunteer Katherine Spegal-Ibarra, a junior majoring in hospitality management.

"This event would not have been as successful if it wasn't for FIU students volunteering," Rubin said.

Headline: BBC-SGC Vice President resigns
Author: Ana Davis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Due to "unforeseen circumstances," Pamela St. Fleur has decided to step down from her position as the Biscayne Bay Campus's Student Government Council vice president.

Camilo Silva, SGC-BBC president gave word of St. Fleur's resignation at the weekly meeting on Jan. 24. 

Before he gave the announcement, Silva paused trying to compose himself.

"One of our members is leaving," he said. "This person is my right hand."

St. Fleur confirmed the announcement, but did not go into detail. 

"This kind of thing usually happens at the beginning of semester, but the fact that she was an executive board member was what made it surprising," said Zach Trautenberg, Comptroller and finance chair of SGC.

Though St. Fleur said she will not take on any future responsibilities, she made it a point that she will still be around FIU pursuing her bachelor's degree in political science.  

Silva presented St. Fleur with a plaque recognizing her as the "Student Government Association Member of the Year." Additionally, Craig Cunningham, SGC advisor, presented her with the SGA Medallion. 

"The medallion represents commitment to students and recognition of service to student government council," Cunningham said. 

The SGA's constitution states when a vacancy occurs in the SGC Vice President position or SGC representative seat, the position is temporarily filled through an election process and selected by SGC representatives.

The new vice president will hold his or her position until the regular annual elections take place at the end of the Spring semester. 

Silva encouraged the rest of the council to nominate any member whom they see fit to do the job, even themselves if they believe they will do the best job. 

The election will take place Jan. 31 at the weekly SGC meeting. 

A major responsibility of the vice president is attending the annual University Council meeting where they negotiate SGA's budget. 

Trautenberg  stressed the importance of the incoming vice president during this meeting.

 "Whoever takes this position must be ready to ask questions, and negotiate," he said.

Trautenberg plans to nominate Brent Maximin, current director of student lobbying in SGC due to the fact that he was the vice-president last year and has experience in the University-wide council. 

Silva described St. Fleur as committed, creative and highly intelligent and said she had done a "remarkable" job during her term.

"Despite going through personal problems, in the fall, she was able to keep the ball rolling," Silva said. 

"This is something I know I take to heart. When I [look back and] think of FIU, I will think of SGA," St. Fleur said.

Headline: Exploitation Nation: Double standards stigmatize female sexuality
Author: Veronica Suarez / Contributing Writer 
&nbsp;
In the music video for Nelly Furtado's song "Promiscuous Girl," Furtado stands against a blue chrome wall and shakes her pelvis to pulsating beats. Her thick neon-white belt glows and sticks to her bare stomach.  Lifting her arms, she turns around, pops her lower back and says, "You expect me to just let you hit it / but will you respect me if you get it?"

The pop hit about casual sex and promiscuity continues the argument of female sexuality ignited by the revolution of the 1960s. For many, the line of what is acceptable is blurry.

 "If a guy is a sexaholic, he is considered a playboy, and that's considered to be cool in a way," said Junior David Bolivar. "Yet, if a woman expresses too much sexual desire, she is called names [such as] slut, tramp, whore. And those are ways of depriving women of their sexual needs."

Sophomore Natalie Soto also thinks women don't have the same sexual liberties as men. While she feels it is acceptable to have premarital sex, "whether it is accepted by society is a difference case."

Many argue that liberation of female sexuality, at least in America, was ignited in the 1960s. The sexual revolution instilled changes in the sexual norms and behaviors of women. Words such as premarital sex, the birth control pill, legalized abortion and casual sex became associated with female sexuality.

"In the United States, the advent of the birth control pill meant that for the first time in history, women's reproductive capabilities became separate from the sexual act of pleasure," said Lois West, a professor of sociology.

But according to West, the sexual revolution has left more than the freedom to have a good time.

"The so-called 'sexual revolution of the sixties' was that women adapted to men's sexual standards," she said. These sexual standards were the "'Hugh Hefner, playboy standards,' [which] unlinked sex from marriage and relationship commitment, making sex for fun more important than sex for marriage."

West argues that the lasting effects of the revolution are still one-sided - women are branded with labels for doing the same things men do. 

"The sexual double standard still stigmatizes women who like a lot of sex with men without relationships," West said.

Author Leora Tanenbaum in her book Slut! Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation, writes about the characteristics of those who judge sexually active women: "Slut-bashing is a cheap and easy way to feel powerful. If you feel insecure or ashamed about your own sexual desires, all you have to do is call a girl a 'slut' and suddenly you're the one who is 'good' and on top of the social pecking order."

West indicated that male dominance and economic inequality in the 1970s are the reasons why the sexual double standard still exists today.

 "Men began to suffer decreasing wages which forced more women into the labor force and changed their negotiating power with men for the better and worse," West said.

West continued by describing what a true female revolution should be, describing it as one "without sexual violence, economic need and the stigma from the double standard."

Some feel, however, that a double standard for sexuality is less of a problem than the misuse of it. Soto feels that women are being objectified in the media and entertainment industry. Instead of being sexually liberated, she argues, they are being sexually exploited.

"Modern women are becoming dehumanized in the media and culture products of the entertainment industry. The trend now for Glamour Magazine is an exploitation of sexuality," Soto said.

Soto added that women should love their internal beauty and accept themselves rather than let society dictate what is sexy for them.

"I don't have to expose myself to feel sexy," she said.

The goal of expressing one's sexuality is to "always have a balance," according to Soto.

For her, the extreme of being sexually over the top or being too sexually conservative is not healthy. She argues that for society, balance is the key to sexual freedom. 

"Modesty is lacking in society, morals are lacking, character is lacking," Soto said. "Society is at an extreme - there is a lack of balance."

Headline: Grammy nominee discusses tour, fears
Author: Alejandra Ramirez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the recent announcement of five Grammy nominations for both his albums Continuum and Try!, singer/songwriter John Mayer sat down for a roundtable interview with college journalists from around Florida to discuss the launch of his Winter Continuum Tour.



Q: You're doing tours back-to-back. How is this taking a toll on you and what are you planning to do to keep this tour new and exciting for you?

Well, it doesn't take a toll on me [and] they're not exactly back-to-back. I think what I've learned is that I don't love being home as much as I think I do when I'm on tour. It's kind of been a catch-22 for quite a while. 

When I'm on tour I go 'Ugh, I can't wait to get home,' so I've definitely had time between the last tour and the upcoming tour to kind of regenerate a bit.

Every break allows me to get distanced enough from the last project I did to be able to figure out how to apply, or what changes I need to make to make something really great. And in the case of this tour, this is really the first tour that is going to be at a human pace, you know? Putting the record out while touring is grueling but I can't wait to bring these songs to the stage and really have that energy level. 

I'm also interested in [changing] the show out of it just being a combination of 14 different songs, [to] really staging a performance, like a real set: a real opener, a real closer, while still keeping the variation.



Q: You're going to visit many cities, so which one would be your favorite and why?

Boston is one of my favorite cities for me to play mostly because Boston is where I got my start musically, by way of going to Berklee College of Music. But everybody has a certain location or different time in their life where they keep their first impression. [It's] just the vibe up there [in Boston] that I relate to and was a part of … I'm not part of it anymore, but I enjoy playing for kids in the crowd or parents in the crowd.



Q: Knowing that you collaborated with Buddy Guy and B.B. King and other artists like that, what influenced you to create a trio?

It's very much Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino. I have played in trio figurations before and really enjoyed the dynamics of it, but playing with Steve and Pino … that was like, 'Whoa.'

It's the same connection you have with people when you say, 'Whoa, I want to get to know them more, I want to keep playing.'



Q: How does it feel to be nominated with the trio?

It's probably the coolest nomination I've ever gotten. I didn't think I'd receive Album of the Year. That one I think is still just a little too large in spectrum for me to really go 'Well, yeah, that's about right.' Even just the nomination alone for me is in recognition of evolving. 



Q: It seems like in the past two years you've been shedding the pop image you had at first. Is that a conscious decision on your part to pursue the blues and the soul influence? Is that just another side of it?

Yes, as a composer I want to write things that represent how I feel now, but not in the sense that I think, 'I better enter a blues trio to make up for what I've done before.' I've been overly successful, and I've realized that and I couldn't have been successful if there weren't people who really related with what I was doing. The only effect that I'm trying to manipulate is the type of song. That is the only real area that I concern myself with when attempting to change people's minds.  It's not a matter of making people like you when they don't like you. It's a matter of making people understand you when you think they don't understand you.



Q: How idealistic are you when it comes to the political statements and problems quoted in your song?

I definitely practice what I preach. I don't necessarily want to get across a large-scale political statement. I'd rather affect the larger world with smaller-scale emotional term. I think the case with 'waiting on the world to change' they both kind of come together toward the center between politics and emotion. So it's initially a little too idealistic. I don't know that everybody dealing in politics or responding to politics has as much time as I had to write this song.



Q: What is your greatest fear as a musician?

Losing touch - putting a record out that I go, 'this is my greatest album' and everybody says, 'this is a piece of crap.' Nobody puts out a crappy record just to put out a crappy record. People put out records that [they] believe are really great and the most scary thing is that there's going to come a day, one day, when I say, 'this record is polished to perfection,' [then] I put it out, and my fans say 'You're kidding right? This is a gag CD, put out the real CD.' So it's always a matter of keeping focused and in touch with what other people hear and think and feel and not let the rarity of the life I've had translate to the perspectives that I have.



Q: You are quoted as saying you "wanted to challenge everybody" and you do have the Jimi Hendrix cover in this album. How do you feel you've done so far? How have you proven to yourself that you've been able to challenge everything and everyone with this new album?

One of the most obvious ways … is people saying, 'Well, you know I never really liked that guy, but I got to give it up to him. His record's great.' That's exciting to me. And I really like the challenge of covering such a big song. I don't see it as solely me just trying to take this on - I hope anybody that hears that song hears the need to play that song. The biggest challenge to me is having a third album out where people know your name, still keeping the ears and mind open for whatever the next thing I'm going to do is. I know that I'm always into hearing new things and trying new sounds. And what's really fun about this record is that it seems to me like I've been discovered again, almost as a new artist.



Q: You do have a fund called "Back to You Fund." How do you feel your music has been able to contribute to that fund and helped other people that maybe don't necessarily hear your music but at least are being helped by it?

There is always the kind of quality from people getting emotional healing from music, which has always been there. What's really interesting is that there are some areas in me, kind of a comedy of energy in terms of what it takes for me to sign an autograph and what it means to someone else that can be really taken advantage of. I can sign a vinyl copy of Continuum and that took me 10 seconds to sign and say it could raise $800 for a good cause. That's something that should definitely be taken advantage [of]. To raise money for a fund that contributes to healthcare and music education is really interesting because I've created a kind of economic system almost. I sell four or five something tickets a night that cost me a certain amount and to be able to put such overhead on it because there's a certain price that people are willing to pay to help people that really need it - that's a really great model for contributing to the cause.

Headline: Review: Lost Planet:  Extreme Condition (Game)
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Many action games tend to be one of two things:  a matter of fighting to win or a matter of survival.  Capcom's latest third-person sci-fi shooter "Lost Planet: Extreme Condition," offered for the X-Box 360, immediately stresses the latter.

"Lost Planet" tells the story of humankind's attempt to colonize the harsh icy planet of E.D.N III.  Thrust into this chaotic world is Wayne, a soldier aiding in the human occupation.  While battling the native Akrid creatures, Wayne is left for dead and rescued by a small group of outcasts who fight off the Akrid and soon discovers the NEVEC faction, who have their own goals for the planet.

The game play is simple: you traverse the arctic environment to accomplish your mission with a nice selection of weapons and grenade types at your disposal.  As a nod to Capcom's own classic "Bionic Commando," Wayne has a retractable grappling hook as well, to help climb or descend to hard to reach places.  One catch, however, is the constant need for thermal energy, which acts as a shield for Wayne.  It heals damage over time and keeps him alive as it slowly runs thin - too much damage and other hazards can still prove fatal.  Fortunately, Wayne can replenish his supply through various checkpoints, storage containers and most of the time, through slain enemies.  Constant fighting while managing energy supply is a key part to the game play as the action intensifies.  Also available are Vital Suits -massive robotic automatons with weapons and features like hovering that can be boarded to fight off enemies or reach new areas.

The game consists of 11 missions, which don't make the game very long; the second half of the game gets pretty rough, though. Still, the game can be completed in about 10 hours. Besides the online multiplayer mode and the hunting of target markers in single player mode for achievements, there really isn't much else the game offers.

Graphically, the environments are nicely detailed as they are destroyed by gunfire and monster alike.  The remains of vast cities and structures left deserted on E.D.N III are very evident and there's no hint of slowdown as the game's action picks up.  The intermission cut scenes are handled well enough while the voice acting is listenable at best.  One issue is that the in-game text size sometimes makes it hard to read, but larger TVs can fix that.  

The music is very well done: the orchestral score that accompanies the action ranges from slower suspenseful pieces to faster, more thunderous scores during high action moments. Composer Jaime Christopherson does an excellent job on the game's score, making an impact on the game's fast and heavy action.

Although short, "Lost Planet" is a very simple and enjoyable run-and-gun action game.  The constant never-ending winter of E.D.N III offers many thrills and suspense for gamers to fight through.  With the 360's selection of action games available, "Lost Planet" manages to stand on it's own.

Headline: Trained parakeet adept at putting, drinking games
Author: Phil Davis / AP Wire
&nbsp;
Ask David Cota, who spent months training his Indian ringneck parakeet A.J. to use a tiny putter to sink putts on a miniature green, making the 5-inch tall bird an Internet video star.

"It doesn't look all that tough nowadays, but try to get a a bird to hold a little stick basically in its beak. The first time, he snapped it right in half," Cota said. A.J. can also dunk a tiny basketball on a tiny court. He rolls over. He shakes. His play dead is spooky.

A "Tonight" show darling from the end of the Johnny Carson era, A.J. and Cota are staging a comeback thanks to such Web sites as YouTube.com. A.J. has a MySpace.com page and his own Web site.

The 16-year-old parakeet recently won an "outrageous bird" viral video contest sponsored by MagRack, an on-demand television network. A.J.'s sporting skills impressed a 13-member celebrity panel that included actor Carol Spinney, Sesame Street's "Big Bird" since 1969, and Tippi Hedren, who got her star turn in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 classic "The Birds."

"I've never seen a little parakeet that was that athletic," said Hedren, who learned to love her avian co-stars despite Hitchcock's ruthless plot. "He was really astounding with his golf game and the basketball. It's just too cute, too adorable. And he looked like he was having fun with it, too."

Cota, 38, owes his extended 15 minutes of fame to two dead parakeets.

The first bird belonged to a college girlfriend. Cota was left to care for it. It died.

"A fluke," he insists. He tried to slip in a replacement parakeet _ and ended up single with plenty of free time to train his new pet parakeet, named "Axl" for the lead singer of Guns N' Roses.

Axl was accidentally crushed only hours before he was scheduled to perform on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" in May 1990. Cota's college roommate fell asleep and rolled on top of the bird in a hotel room provided by NBC. The death made national news.

Carson turned the mishap into a comedy bit. Wearing a black armband, he hosted an on-air memorial service for Axl, complete with "Taps" performed by Doc Severinsen. Carson gave Cota a new parakeet, A.J., whose name is a nod to Axl and to Carson. He told Cota to come back on the show when he'd trained the new bird.

Cota and A.J. performed for Carson. They have also been on with Jay Leno and on David Letterman's "Stupid Pet Tricks."

Cota, who works for sports apparel distributor in southwest Florida, stumbled into the world of bird training by accident.

In college, he and his friends were impressed by Axl's skills at the college drinking game "quarters." The goal is to bounce quarters into a glass, or drink if you miss. Axl would run down runaway quarters and dunk them.

"The bird became kind of like the wild card," Cota said. "You could bid to have the bird on your team, so if you missed and the bird would put it in, you'd still get credit. So I just turned that quarter game into basketball."

A.J. now knows far more tricks than Axl did. Cota and his friends have built elaborate sets including a basketball court featuring the Portland Trail Blazers' logo and a putting green complete with plastic putter and a golf bag.

Next up on A.J.'s training agenda: Water skiing.

"I don't think there is any limit to what I can show him," Cota said.

Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief

Adventure: A bold, usually risky undertaking; a hazardous action of uncertain outcome.

-Random House Unabridged Dictionary, 2006



Though Brandon Viani doesn't like to admit it, he's pretty much done it all and, if he hasn't, he'll do it soon enough.

I've known Viani, 22, for about three years. We don't hang out as much as would be expected of friends (I see him once or twice a semester), but he's one of the few people I know who could be described with the rather over-used adjective 'worldly.'

The other day, as we sat in a crowded Hooters discussing life, our futures and what we've each been up to, I became enthralled by the stories he recounted of his latest escapades.

He told me of his experience snowboarding in Colorado while visiting his brother; how they were caught in a three-day blizzard and how it didn't matter because the snow was so soft it felt like walking through pillows.

He told me of his first skydiving jump and the thrill he felt while watching the earth magnify under him.

Viani sipped his beer, told a story, took another sip and, as always happens when we get together, I kept interrupting his sips with the question "And then what happened?"

Viani lives for adventure and that's what fascinates me about him, why I can't help liking his stories so much.

He's slept in public parks while touring Europe, has fended off multiple pick-pockets, been an Abercrombie & Fitch model and is currently training to fly a fighter jet for the U.S. Air Force.

"I believe that things will happen for the best and that if I believe that, I will get only the best from life," he said.

Like most people, Viani thinks about death and about the consequences of his actions, but these aren't thoughts that preoccupy him much.

"When I was jumping off that plane, I told my brother I was scared and he told me something that was incredible. He said, 'You can't think about death, you can't think about what you're going to do wrong. You can only think about what you're going to do right. If you mess up, if you're equipment doesn't work, then that's out of your control. You can only focus on what's in your control.' And, yeah, you can say that's the philosophy I live by," Viani said.

Viani's approach to life reminds me of a principle espoused by the 20th century philosopher and mathematician Ludwig Wittgenstein. Following a school of thought known as logical positivism, Wittgenstein believed that the meaning of life - much like a scientific statement - could only be found through the facts and evidence experienced by an individual from day to day.

"Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present," Wittgenstein wrote.

In other words, life shouldn't be thought about, it should be lived.

Viani lives for life, quietly waiting for the next adventure because he's positive that there will always be a next adventure.

"I'm not really interested in knowing if I'll be remembered or not," he said. "I just want to know that I did what I could while I was here and that I enjoyed it."

As he finishes his beer, Viani smiles and tells me of a plan to visit Finland and hike through the frozen fjords.

I may not see him again for a while, but I know that when I do, he'll have a hell of a story to tell.

Headline: THE BIG GREEN: Resolution passes to fund FIU's new stadium
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Florida Board of Governors passed a resolution Jan. 25 that would enable FIU to fund renovations for an FIU stadium.

The resolution will allow FIU to issue bonds to fund the first phase of the project which will add 10,500 seats and amenities such as 14 air-conditioned luxury suites, a wrap-around concourse with a full field view, 1,400 club seats, a video scoreboard and a stadium club.

"This will be a crown jewel for the University. It's going to be a student complex center and also our stadium," said Pete Garcia, athletic director. "This is going to be the center of campus, eventually when it's finished and finalized."

Phase one of the stadium renovation is estimated to cost $31 million and be completed by the opening of the 2008 football season.

Phase two of the project will include the construction of a 100,000 sq. ft. student center that will house undergraduate advising, admissions, financial aid and a welcome center. 

Many student services currently located in Primera Casa will be moved into the new student center upon its completion in 2011.

This phase of the project is estimated to cost $24 million and has yet to be approved for funding by the Florida Board of Governors.

According to Charles Tinder, senior director of the college finances, students may have to bare some of the stadium renovation costs depending on whether or not athletic fees are increased.

Currently, students pay $20 per semester in athletic fees but the Athletics Department has proposed to increase the fee by $1.39 per credit hour.

Students can voice their opinions on this decision to the Athletics Fee Committee at one of two public forums taking place at UP and Biscayne Bay Campus on Feb. 7. 

The public forum being held at BBC will be held in the Wolfe University Center, room 155 at 3:30 p.m. The same public forum will be held at 1 p.m. in the Graham Center, room 150 for students at the UP.

Tinder also said that the increase would approximately generate $1.1 million in revenue for the Athletics Department. 

He also said $655,000 of that revenue will go towards paying back the bonds, while the rest will be used for marketing athletics and ticket sales. 

The bonds will also be repaid with funds from ticket sales, vendor revenues, corporate sponsorships and naming rights. 

According to Senior Associate Athletic Director Julie Berg, most universities use bonds on major capital facility projects like stadiums. While renovations are taking place next year, Athletics is exploring the possibility of playing next season's home games at the Orange Bowl.

Though they won't have a permanent home next season, the Golden Panthers believe that having a stadium is a sign of better things to come.

"We've been anticipating this for a long time," red shirt sophomore linebacker Wendy Napoleon said. "When you feel good, you play good. It makes you even more excited to play in a stadium like that."

Headline: Nursing research earns grant
Author: Maria Concha / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Two nurse professors, Joanne Youngblut and Dorothy Brooten, will soon be working on a five-year study that will examine the impact of a child's death on the parents after receiving a $2.15 million grant from the National Institute of Health's National Institute of Nursing Research.

"Research in this area is crucial so that pediatric, neonatal intensive care professionals and primary care providers can identify parents and families at risk for poor outcome and target them for early intervention," Youngblut said.

The five-year study will focus on how the families function and relate with one another after the death of a child in a pediatric or neonatal intensive care unit.

The goal is to understand why some family members react differently and function less well than others, identify the signs of declining functionality, and find out which families may be at greater risk to deteriorate as a unit after such a loss, Youngblut said.

"By knowing what signs to look for in someone's behavior that point to a potential for deterioration, pediatric or neonatal intensive care unit team members can take the necessary and appropriate steps, both in and out of the hospital setting, to help these parents, these families, deal with a child's death before they have significant difficulty functioning," Brooten said.

The first step in the study consists in identifying and recruiting mothers and fathers of about 185 infants or children who have died.

Those parents who agree will have to fill out questionnaires after the first, third, sixth and 13th month preceding the child's death.

The questionnaires will include questions about the parents' physical and mental health, daily functioning and relationship with their surviving children and with their spouse/partner.

"We hope to be able to learn what families experience during the 13 months following the death, what helped them and what was problematic in order to help other parents and families experiencing this in the future," Brooten said. "It should also help us identify families in the future who may be at risk for dysfunction."

Besides Youngblut's and Brooten's involvement in the project, four other faculty members will be serving as co-principal investigators.

The team also includes co-investigators from Miami Children's Hospital, Jackson Memorial Hospital and Broward General Medical Center.

In order to receive a grant from the National Institute of Nursing Research, the R01 research grants are reviewed by a national panel of experienced researchers three times a year.

The NINR then funds the grants with the best reviews or scores. 

According to Brooten, the NINR awards grants like this, but they are very competitive and very few investigators submitting grant proposals are successful in gettin them.

The steps that the research team had to undertake in order to compete to receive this grant were to construct an application that included an abstract, budget, biosketches or resumes of the investigators, a description of FIU's resources for research, a description of the three hospitals where the families will be recruited and a very detailed plan for the research.

This particular project was selected because "it addresses an important area of science, has high potential to provide knowledge that will improve the health of the nation, and has a strong and feasible research plan with a strong research team," Youngblut said.

"We were successful because we wrote a good grant proposal, we have a history of previously receiving NIH grants and the University has the basic supports for the project," Brooten said.  

The NIH grant provided money for both direct and indirect costs.

This research study will bring many benefits to FIU.

According to Brooten, the research will bring good publicity for the University, provide Ph. D. students experiences with research active faculty and it brings money to the University in indirect cost recovery.

"[This will bring FIU] national and international notoriety for the work we do here," Youngblut said. "This increases the University's prestige and helps us to recruit the best students to our undergraduate and graduate programs."

Headline: Conference addresses Internet security
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Identity theft has become a multibillion-dollar a year criminal operation. Estimates show that as many as 9 million people have their identity stolen each year, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

To help combat the rising threat of cyber terrorism, the FIU Information Technology Security Office will be holding the "IT Security Awareness Conference" Feb. 1 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the Graham Center Ballrooms.

"We have some very interesting presentations given by industry experts," said John Cabarga, marketing coordinator for UTS. 

Sponsored by the University's Division of Information Technology, the $5,000 conference will be open to FIU students, faculty and staff as well as members of the South Florida community.

The conference is a free event and attendance is being encouraged for anyone who is interested. To RSVP, go to the IT Security Office website at http://security.fiu.edu.

The presentations include topics such as child safety on the Internet, keeping your identity secure on the Internet, and identity theft threats and trends.

According to the ITSO website, the focus of the conference will be IT Security Awareness. The conference will address the importance awareness plays in maintaining security. Al Johnson, 

director of the national law enforcement and corrections technology center of the FBI,  will be the keynote speaker. 

In addition to Johnson there will be several other guest speakers lecturing on the various topics of the conference. The first scheduled speaker will be Manny Medina, CEO and President of Terremark Worldwide, Inc.

Later on Kevin Parker, a representative from the FBI, will make the presentation of the child safety portion of the conference. Following Parker will be Marsali S. Hancock, president of the Internet Keep Safe Coalition.

According to a study by the University of New Hampshire, one in five children using the Internet received an online sexual solicitation within a one-year period and 15 percent of the time there was an attempt by the solicitor to meet the child in person.

Following Parker and Hancock will be Linda McCarthy, executive security advisor for Symantec. McCarthy received the Women of Influence award for computer security from CSO Magazine.

The award honors outstanding achievement in security, privacy and risk management. In 2006 she began touring the United States teaching people, including government officials, about Internet safety.

The last guest of the conference will be John Large, deputy special agent in charge, US Secret Service. During his presentation Large will cover identity theft and its growing rate in the United States.

FIU personnel who will also be presenting at the conference include Cheryl Granto, an IT Security Officer; Min Yao, vice president and CIO for University Technology Services; Pierre Schoepp, software licensing manager for University Technology Services; and Gerard Klonarides, a lecturer of Decision Sciences.

"I've discovered there are very few people who are aware of how careful they need to be on the Internet," Granto said. "People need to be keeping their computer secure, as a lot of the sites they go to have malicious software that infects their computer to host porn and send spam among other things."

According to Granto, many individuals who configure wireless Internet access for their homes have that connection hacked by people who use it to download illegal content such as child pornography.

"People just don't know how to secure their connection," Granto said. "And this conference will be focusing on personal safety."

Headline: Tutoring, movie nights part of club's outreach mission
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
In a community primarily made up of Hispanic students, the Black Student Union serves as a medium for black students to express themselves.

"Our goal is to be the voice of the black community," said Will Hatcher, president of the BSU.

The organization, which was established in 1978, meets every Tuesday in the Graham Center, room 140, at 8 pm. During the meetings, various issues affecting the black community are discussed in a forum-like manner where members are encouraged to bring forward different opinions and ideas.

"Anyone who wants to be involved in what we do is welcome to join," said BSU Vice President Stacey Holley. "Students will just have to understand that most of the issues we bring up will be about the black community."

Although junior Melissa Hermida is not black, she joined the BSU because of the active tutoring program the organization provides every week.

"I'm involved with their Phoenix tutoring and mentoring program," Hermida said. "It's just a really great program."

Tutoring is held at the Opa Locka City Hall, Monday through Friday from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. and on Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Phi Beta Sigma fraternity also co-sponsors the tutoring.

"We have 15 core tutors and 60 to 70 students every Saturday, which is when the bulk of our tutoring takes place," Hatcher said. 

In addition to their tutoring program the BSU has an onslaught of events planned for the rest of the Spring semester. The largest event planned is the BSU Conference, which will take place Feb. 22 through 24. The event will be free to FIU students, but will cost between $15 to $35 for others to attend. The final cost has not been determined as of Jan. 23.

The conference will include a neo soul music concert and a lecture by Al Sharpton.

"The conference is meant to empower black students to become more involved," Hatcher said.

There are also several more regular events being hosted by the BSU. The first is a weekly event called the Union. The Union will be held every Wednesday starting in February from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the housing quad. It will serve as a networking and gathering place for students.

BSU is also planning a series of movie nights where a movie relevant to the black community in some way will be shown and discussed. The first movie night of the year will be Jan. 31 and Idlewild will be shown. Future movie night dates have not been set but will be announced during the weekly BSU meetings.

Open Mic Night will also be held the last week of each month with specific dates to be determined. During the Open Mic Nights, BSU members and anyone else in attendance will be able to share poetry, songs and other forms of artistic expression.

The BSU will be sponsoring students to attend the 30th annual "Big XII Conference" on black student government at the University of Nebraska from Feb.15 to 18.

The Big XII Conference was the model for BSU's own conference according to Hatcher.

BSU members hope that with the various events being planned, they will be able to increase membership in order to be more effective in their goals throughout the community.

"The people [in the BSU] know where you're coming from," said junior Lori Bellot.

With their friendly meeting atmosphere and collective determination, the BSU hopes to start changes in the community, which they believe is one of their club's main goals.

Headline: Hillary Clinton not the best choice for Democrats in 2008
Author: Reinier Hernandez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Senator Hillary Clinton stated she would seek the Democratic presidential nomination on Saturday, Jan. 20. 

This has come as no surprise to many who believed she would run, especially after becoming the first First Lady of the United States to hold an elected office, and if elected, would be the country's first female President.

Yet despite a landslide victory in her bid for re-election to the Senate, several members within her party are weary of her seeking the nomination for fear that she is too polarizing to win, and her campaign will only draw votes away from other possible Democratic contenders.

While Clinton has emerged as a frontrunner for the nomination, several other candidates have stated their interest in running, many of whom stand out as more qualified and more likely to carry the party to victory in the 2008 election.

The junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, recently announced his plans to form a presidential exploratory committee, and with his youth, charisma and popularity, he has often been compared to a previous presidential hopeful, John F. Kennedy. Obama also has the luxury of not having been in the Senate in 2002 when the vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq took place, unlike Clinton who voted for it. The war is an obvious hot button issue with several voters, and his anti-war stance could be a huge asset to him come election day.

If elected, Obama would be the first African-American to hold the highest office in the nation, something that would draw many African-Americans to vote. Unfortunately, this would also attract racist voters,  and his relative inexperience and vaguely Muslim background will more than likely be preyed upon during his race.

Also running is former Senator John Edwards of South Carolina, who has many similarities to Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton. Both are Southern Democrats, something that can attract voters from the mostly Democratic North and swing voters from the South. Edwards and the former president also share a gift for oratory and due to his campaign in the 2004 presidential race, Edwards has an established name.

Clinton does have some strong advantages on her side, chiefly name recognition, a possible domination of the female vote and the financial backing to get her message to the public. Clinton also has definite leadership qualities with her name being bandied about in regards to taking the Majority Leader position in the Senate when current leader Harry Reid steps down.

However, she lacks the charisma needed to draw people to the polls, something that could also be said of the previous Democratic nominee, John Kerry. Conservatives and centrists see Clinton as too liberal, and Democrats are turned off by her vote in favor of the Iraq war. The fact that she is so well known also hinders her ability to draw new supporters, and her position as defacto nominee annoys some Democrats

The bottom line is that Clinton's polarizing nature will divide voters and create several who will vote Republican, simply for the reason that they're "anyone but Hillary".

Headline: STATE OF DIVISION: Democrats should stop whining, support President's initiatives
Author: Jose Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The segmented and almost sectarian nature of the United States government was conspicuously revealed in President Bush's recent State of the Union address. It was vividly showcased in a potent mixture of thunderous applause and sullen faces, reflective of the Republican and Democratic extremists who have come to dominate the legislative branch.

I could not help but be taken aback by the farcical and absurd state in which the political arena is

functioning. The divisions and schisms that have arisen over the past few decades have transformed

lawmakers into an extremist mob, bent on overthrowing one another.

With every point the President made, it seemed that the Democrats, operating in lock step under their puppet master Nancy Pelosi, sat in consternation as their Republican counterparts monolithically rose to exult him.

This ridiculous display of ideological differences, however, was not potent enough to overshadow President Bush's plan to steer our nation in the right direction. Bush's proposals on energy in particular 

were most ambitious, perhaps too ambitious to be implemented in a practical matter. Nonetheless, the

proposals were a welcome divergence from our nation's current reliance on foreign oil and petroleum. 

By curtailing our reliance on Middle Eastern oil, our nation is averting the catastrophic consequences that political conflict in the Middle East may have on the energy sector, and the ability of the American people to travel and  commute in their automobiles with minimal financial burden.

The President's proposals for immigration reform, while not stringent enough to halt the impending segmentation of the nation into several ethnic factions, is a promising solution for the problem that immigration, when not carefully overseen, poses to the unity of our nation and the availability of jobs for hard working American citizens. 

Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the President's rather brief speech were his statements regarding Iraq.

The President's decision to significantly increase the number of troops stationed in Iraq is certainly very beneficial to stabalizing the already compromised  security of the Middle East that is in a most fragile state. The troop surge, while certainly modest compared to what is needed for decisive military victory, is sufficient to ensure the survival of the Iraqi democratic government, which must begin taking the initiative in quelling the insurgent threat.

The only sure way to guarantee victory in Iraq is to equip the Iraqi government with the resources to defend it, which at the moment is only possible through continued support from the United States Armed Forces.

Withdrawing troops from the region, as is adamantly proposed by foolish liberal idealists, would result in catastrophic consequences for the entire Middle East, and most importantly, the security of the American people.

It might give rise to a radical regime, more or less analogous to the Iranian government. That will compromise not only the safety of our country, but also the safety of our ally Israel,  also the sworn enemy of extremists.

The American people and the Democratic Party must cease their almost womanly panting and raving, and accept responsibility for the miscalculation made by President Bush's cabinet, and renew their support for the war effort.

Failure in this endeavor will surely lead to attacks identical in magnitude, if not far more devastating than the World Trade Center attacks, which brought America to its knees.

Diplomacy, while certainly desirable, is not attainable. The enemy is determined to rid the world of democracy, and to rid

the Middle East of every shred of Western influence.

For that reason, we must strive forward, and fight for the sanctity of democracy and the safety of our nation.

Going into a new season, sports teams usually have a set of expectations they would like to meet by season's end, whether it's having a winning percentage over .500, winning the conference title, etc.

As for Danny Price, entering his 28th season as head coach of the baseball team, his approach to a new season is a little different.

 "It's hard to see past the first game," Price said. "One thing I have to do is keep everybody focused on one thing at a time. For example, they got classes, weight training, tutoring, baseball practice, so in this business your expectations are to win them all. And your expectations are to manage whatever it is you have in front of you [at the moment]."

After going 36-24 in 2006, Price - 1060-568 all-time at FIU - has five of his top six hitters from last season and a total of 15 players returning - including two preseason All-Sun Belt selections. But with 19 new players coming in, Price wants his returning players to bring leadership to the squad.

 "I don't care how good of a team you have ability wise, if you don't have leadership you cannot win," Price said. "You have to have leadership and you have to have strong character."



 PITCHERS



The Golden Panthers return seven pitchers from last year, including senior Walker Whitley, who pitched a team-high 126.2 innings last year. Even though he was a starter last season, his durability will move him to the bullpen as the first option in tight 

situations.

"The success of this team is really going to be about keeping Walker in the pen," Price said. "If we have to bring Walker to a starter, then those in the starting roles haven't done their jobs. I know Walker can start and I trust Walker in big game situations. Walker can throw everyday [and] I want Walker to be in there at the end of the game."

Whitley added, "I'm expecting good things." 

As for the starting pitchers, newcomers Chris Allen and Corey Polizzano have been penciled in as No. 1 and 2 to start the season, but their order is unclear.

Allen, a 6-4 junior transfer from Clemson University, threw only one inning last year, but showed enough promise in Fall practice to earn the spot.

"I'm just looking to do whatever I can to help this team get wins [and] help get us to a regional, maybe a super regional and try to elevate this program a little bit to put it on the map even more so than it is," Allen said.

Polizanno, a freshman left-hander from Southridge high school, posted an 8-2 record with a 0.65 ERA his senior year, which led to him being selected first team All-Dade and second team All-State.

"He's going to get an opportunity, but he has to take advantage of that opportunity to get out next week," Polizanno said.

The third weekend starter is still undecided, but look for James Lajiness (1.12 ERA in 8 innings pitched last year) or 6-3 freshman Ryan Bernal.

Juniors Eric Hortsmann and Jorge Ramos, senior lefty Chris Siebenaler will initially be coming out of the bullpen. Evan Ellison, a left-handed freshman from California, and junior transfer Steven Stewart (1.40 ERA in 55 innings last year at Surry Community College) should see some time out of the pen as well.

Junior Kyle Preshong and senior Akeem Francis are nursing injuries will miss the first months of the season, but will definitely see time on the mound as well.

"The whole key to it, like every year, is pitching," Price said. "I know from the start we can never fall on defense. We got to be strong on defense every year, every day, every play. We got to pitch down. We know we're not going to throw the ball past a lot of people and that's ok, but if we can pitch ahead in the count and from the knees on down [on opposing hitters], we're going to be fine."



CATCHERS



The team will benefit in this position from the return of the two guys who spent most of last season splitting time behind the plate.

Junior Luis Bautista led the team in on-base percentage (.477) last year and was third with a .357 batting average. 

He started 27 games at catcher last season and 21 games at designated hitter - a trend which should continue this year. He also hit three home runs, had 35 RBI and walked 26 times.

Senior Cody Jacobs, who may also see time at right field, started nine games at catcher and 15 at designated hitter. He hit .230 last year with three home runs and 15 RBI.

Freshmen Nick Martinez, from Miami Springs, and Kevin Mirabal, from Gulliver Prep, will see some time behind the plate as well.



INFIELD



Senior Bryan Pullin (.368, four home runs, 35 RBI) and junior Corey Lozano (.309, four home runs, 37 RBI) should remain at third and second base, respectively, like they were for the most part a year ago.

However, Price has high hopes for junior college transfer Ryan Mollica.

"Boy, he's got some pop in his bat," Price said. "I can play him at third. I can play him at second. I can play him at first. It's going to be hard to keep his bat out of the line up."

Mollica, who batted .352 with five home runs and 32 RBI last season, should see time at first base to start the season.

"I just want to help contribute to the team," Mollica said. "It's my first year from Junior college and I had a pretty good career in Junior college and am hoping to continue at the Division I level."

If Lozano or Pullin struggle, look for Mollica to take over their spots and lefty John Petika, Mollica's teammate at Central Florida Community College last year, to step in at first.

2006 Gatorade Player of the Year and Louisville Slugger Player of the Year in the state of Delaware, freshman Tyler Townsend, should see sometime at first base or designated hitter. 

The 6-2, 230-lbs. lefty batted .600 with eight home runs and 32 RBI in his senior year.

"I'm just coming in here trying to help the team as best I can - whatever role it is," Townsend said.

Price added, "He's going to get his opportunity and when he gets his opportunity, he's got to keep it." 

At shortstop, there is a battle going on between two newcomers, as last year's primary starter, Alex Alfonso, will be red shirted this season.

 "I think there are some absolute fantastic things going on at shortstop. [Manuel Arrojo] and [Eugene Glynn], those guys are battling out there tooth and nail," Price said.

Arrojo, another freshman from Southridge, is considered more defensively sound. Meanwhile, Glynn, a sophomore transfer from Phoenix College, is considered more ready offensively.



OUTFIELD



The outfield is set at center and left with preseason All-Sun Belt picks senior Chris Dunn and junior James McOwen.

"For sure [they're] two of the outstanding players in the conference," Price said "I've spent a lot of time with the guys - I'm coaching the outfield this year. They've got a lot of talent and [both of them] came on last year."

McOwen hit .349 last year with eight home runs and team-high 71 RBI and had mixed feeling on being awarded preseason All-Sun Belt.

"It's an honor," McOwen said. "It gives me confidence going into the season, but it also scares me a little bit that the coaches voted for it, because last year and the year before I wasn't known that much. So it might make it harder and a bit more challenging.

"Now it's something to live up to. It would be embarrassing if I didn't come through."

Dunn had the highest batting average on the team (.376) and also led the team with 29 stolen bases.

"It's always good to get recognized and be able to know that other coaches recognize you as a good player [but] I don't really think too much about it," Dunn said. "I just want to play. I don't want to be living up to any expectations or anything - just play how I've always been playing and try not to think about it too much."

There is another battle developing for the spot right field between sophomore DePhillip Mason, who recorded a hit in 12 of 14 starts, and freshman lefty Bryan Adams - both of whom are graduates of Monsignor Pace High School. As mentioned earlier, Cody Jacobs can see time out there, too.



OUTLOOK



As with any team, pitching is always important and the team seems deep in the bullpen, but Price believes defense is as important.

"Pitching is always going to be the situation that kind of divides the team," Price said. "Is the pitching going to carry your defense? Absolutely not. The defense is going to carry a pitcher. We have got to play defense. We cannot have any slumps on defense."

With that said, Dunn has his own outlook and other teammates may share his sentiments.

"This is my last year [and] the biggest thing I want is to win," Dunn said. "All the individual stuff doesn't matter to me. I want to get that Sun Belt ring. That's more important right now and I think we have the team to do it."

Headline: Price's teachings extend beyond the diamond
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
A young recruit was invited to visit FIU in 1972. He was shown a fence and a field where the baseball team would play its games.

Over three decades later, Danny Price is entering his 28th year as head coach of the Golden Panthers baseball team.

He opted to attend FIU in its inaugural baseball year due to the persistence of former head coach Tom Wonderling.

"He was calling me and he was calling me a lot," Price said. "All that calling made me feel special and he sold me on the fact of being there on opening day of FIU."

He graduated from FIU in 1974, received his master's degree in 1976 and became the voluntary assistant coach in 1978. Following the departure of Wonderling, he accepted the head coaching job in 1980. He has compiled a 1060-568 record as the Golden Panthers head coach.

Despite being involved in baseball as a player and coach for over 40 years, some of Price's favorite moments are experienced off the baseball diamond: at sea.

"I get my son, my buddy Jerry Beverly with his daughters and we eat fish and lobster for two days," Price said. "Those are some of the best days I can ever have."

His wallet is filled with pictures of his three-year-old granddaughter, Taylor, who calls Price "grandfather."

"When you hear this little girl just say 'grandfather,' it's the neatest thing in the world," Price said.

In addition, pictures of former and current players' children decorate his wallet.

"A card, a letter, a phone call," Price said. "I like to hear success stories come through here."

At the inaugural FIU Hall of Fame ceremony, Price watched one of the success stories honored: Boston Red Sox third basemen Mike Lowell. Lowell was diagnosed with testicular cancer when he was 25 years-old. He managed to overcome the disease and continue his career in the Major Leagues.

"A lot of people can make it to the big leagues, but a lot of people can't handle adversity," Price said.

  Players are not hesitant to seek counseling from Price when adversity faces them. Senior catcher Luis Bautista's grandmother passed away last year and he received counseling from Price.

"He told me, 'You can count on me for anything,' Bautista said. "He's more than a manager, he's a friend."

According to Price, baseball isn't just a sport that involves hitting, pitching and fielding. It is a tool used to mold the characters of young men by teaching them how to deal with failure.

"In life, you definitely don't get all green lights," he said. "In baseball, a player has to be able to handle failure; you hit .300 in the major leagues and you're a multi-millionaire."

Failing seven times out of 10 is considered successful in baseball.

 It is Price's duty to guide his players whether they're succeeding or failing, playing or warming the bench.

"When you've got nine positions and 30 players, you can't involve everyone," Price said. "It's the rapport you have with the other 15 to 20 players; I try to spend as much or more time with those players."

Senior infielder Bryan Pullin had a difficult time becoming a member of the Golden Panthers. Danny Price gave Pullin an opportunity to play for the Golden Panthers under one condition: "Don't let me down."

"He took me under his wing and gave me a shot," Pullin said. "He helps everybody, but I guess my problems were easier to recognize."

Price has coached hundreds of players during is tenure, but players have returned the favor.

"Young people have such a positive outlook on life. I hope my players get as much from me as they're giving me," Price said. "We think we're the ones teaching, but we're the ones learning."

Although managing a baseball team requires a great deal of communication, Price is serene during the majority of games. As a fan, he savors every moment of every baseball game.

"I'm quiet during most of the ballgame; I like to absorb the game itself," Price said. "I look at every pitch, I watch everything on the field and I have the best seat in the house."

27 different teams have played under coach Price and he remembers something poignant from each team.

According to Price, he can't remember what he had for breakfast by lunchtime, but he recalls specific moments from a variety of games.

The 28th team preparing itself to represent FIU and coach Danny Price has 15 returning players and could see several newcomers make critical contributions to the team.

"This team is going to write their own chapter and they're in the introduction part right now," Price said.

Something Price has not gotten accustomed to in 27 seasons has been losing. This season will be no exception.

"I thought, when you got older, losing became easier; losses hurt as much today as the first time I lost," Price said.

He admits he is ambitious, but he adheres to two coaching beliefs in order to be successful.
