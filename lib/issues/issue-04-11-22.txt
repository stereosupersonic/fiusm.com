Subheadline: Review of fall sports season
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With the fall season coming to an end, I wanted to sit down and recap fall season of FIU sports. 

Some teams outperformed fans' expectations, one regressed and the others performed at the level they were last season. Here's a team-by-team recap in which I will discuss the season and the future of each team.


Football


Due to its bad luck this hurricane season, the Golden Panther football team will finish off the season later than usual - in December. 

After starting the season with an incredible come from behind victory against Youngstown and a big win against a very good team in Stephen F. Austin, the team has struggled and dropped to a losing 2-5 record.

Don Strock's team has dropped four games in which the team was leading at halftime. The defense has struggled immensely, leading Strock to call its performance embarrassing.

 Silly penalties on the part of the players, a disappointing defense and an ineffective second half offense, have been the key factors in FIU's struggles. 

A player or two will need to step up as vocal leaders in order to stop teammates from getting penalties such as late hits, offsides and arguing with referees.

The three key factors in FIU's struggles also fall on Strock. As a coach, he needs to set his players straight so, they don't commit penalties that will hurt the team. With blown leads of 17-0 and 24-0, such losses should untimely fall on the coaching staff.  

When up by a large margin, the team should continue to run the ball in the second half behind senior Rashod Smith. 

Against McNeese State for example, Smith carried the ball only five times in the second half, leading to many three and outs by the offense. 

Fans wishing for a coaching change will have to wait. There will be no such luck. Strock will be given at least another two seasons before wins and losses start to come into effect.


Men's soccer


Congratulations to coach Karl Kremser and the rest of the team. Despite losing star goal keeper Roy Rosenberg and electrifying forward John Pulido, the team has not missed a beat, winning a third straight Atlantic Soccer Conference title.

The team went undefeated in conference play and had nine players honored to the All-Conference team. Kremser picked up Atlantic Soccer Conference Coach of the Year for the third time since FIU joined the conference five years ago.

FIU made its fourth consecutive appearance in the NCAA championship. Despite losing in the first round, the team still had a good year. It will join in a more competitive soccer conference next season in Conference USA.


Women's soccer


Wow. This is the true underdog story of the year. After winning only four games in the last two seasons, coach Everton Edwards's team advanced to the final of the Sun Belt Conference-a tangle from which one thought only Houdini could have escaped. 

Despite only playing six of its 20 games at home, the team's  home games were the key to the season's success. 

The team finished a perfect 6-0 at home, which proved helpful in the postseason, because the SBC was held at FIU. Playing in front of a home crowd, the women reached the final but lost 1-0 to North Texas.

Playing top teams like Florida State University and the University of Florida early in its schedule helped the young FIU team prepare for the Sun Belt Conference games late in the season.

Young freshman goalie, Madeline Gannon, led the team all year. She filled the shoes of last year's starter, Juliana Gomez perfectly, finishing the season with 81 saves.


Volleyball


By far, this team was the biggest disappointment of the season, finishing with a horrible 3-21 overall record. The team lost 18 of its final 20 games, ultimately taking the title for the losingest team of the season. 

Despite having a relatively new team with only six returning players, more than three victories were expected from coach Cookie Stevens's team. When seven seniors graduated last season, the six-year coach recruited top second year players from dominate junior colleges.

Individual players stood out but not with W's on the record. Expect the team to turn around next season, as many of the players will return with one year of experience under their belt. 

When Stevens came to FIU in 1999 as a NJCAA champion, she turned the program around within three seasons, leading the Golden Panthers to a Sun Belt Conference Championship in 2001. With many coaching honors and victories, Stevens should bounce back strong next season.


Cross Country


Steve Rubin's  young women's team, made up of only freshman and sophomores, reached the NCAA Regional Finals. Star Amanda Howard led the team, running the second fastest 6,000-meter time in FIU history.

 Howard finished 43rd out of 163 runners at the meet. The team also competed well at the Sun Belt Conference Championship, finishing third as a team, but the men struggled, finishing in tenth place. 

Both teams will have time to grow as neither have seniors.

Headline: Basketball opens season with victory
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Sergio Rouco era started with everything he promised when he was hired in March of this year. Up-tempo basketball, hustling players and improved team chemistry led to the Golden Panthers first win of the season.

With 38 seconds remaining in the game, an Ivan Almonte lay-up broke a 62-62 tie and sealed the victory for FIU over Florida Atlantic on Nov. 19 at Pharmed Arena.

The Golden Panthers defeated the Owls 65-62, ending a losing streak of two years.

After leading 34-27 at halftime, the Owls tied the score and took a 55-46 lead with 8:08 remaining in the game behind a full court press to which FIU could not find an answer. With three players cramping up and suffering minor injures, FIU went 10 players deep in the bench to secure the victory. Head coach Rouco was proud of the comeback.

"[The victory] is big, because we fought back," said Rouco. "We had three guys cramping up, and we could have faulted and didn't. Our guys didn't give up. I said before, we are going to play hard, and we are not going to make excuses."

New players Ivan Almonte and Ismael N'Diaye led FIU in scoring with 16 and 14 points respectively. Veteran center Byron Burnett played a monster game on defense, finishing with eight blocks.

With 12 seconds left in the game, FAU had the ball and waited to take the final shot. The Golden Panther defense played man to man and FAU was unable to take the shot as the shot clock expired.

"To win the ballgame and holding them to a shot clock violation, that's big. It showed a lot of character from this team," Rouco said.

N'Diaye (pronounced EN-jai) is happy to play for FIU. The junior played his freshman year at the University of Miami.

"I know they were doing bad the last two years, but I'm ready to have an exciting year here," said N'Diaye.

&nbsp;
It would have been easy for the women's basketball team to make excuses for the season.

Two major players are out for the year for different reasons. Deniz Boz, the leader of the squad, is sitting out due to an ACL injury, and Allison Bustamante decided to call it quits after being the second leading scorer of the team last season.  

But coach Cindy Russo and her team picked up a 61-44 victory in the season opener behind standouts Faeza Bouderra, and Milena Tomova.

FIU defeated Bucknell at Pharmed Arena on Nov. 19. From the opening tip off, the Golden Panthers went on an 11-0 run and never looked back.

After the victory, Russo was proud of the way her team came together despite preseason adversity.

"I think we played excellent defense," said Russo. "We did some pretty good things for our first game as a team."

Tomova took control of the paint all game long, leading the game with seven offensive rebounds and 15 points.

"Everybody out there wanted to make sure they played good defense," said Tomova. "We wanted to be consistent and keep steady with our defense, and we did a very good job of that."

With Boz out, replacement Bouderra delivered a solid performance contributing 11 points, four steals and three assists on the night. FIU neither trailed nor led by less than seven points after its 9-0 run at the beginning of the game.

Headline: Knights eliminate FIU
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There was an electrifying atmosphere at the FIU Soccer Stadium on Nov. 19, as the Golden Panthers men's soccer team was prepared to take on a familiar foe.

The Golden Panthers faced the University of Central Florida, which it beat in all of their previous six meetings - including a win just 12 days ago. Except, this time it mattered.

 It was the opening round of the NCAA Tournament, and the two teams squared off against each other for the third straight year to begin tournament play. With a 23-6-3 all time advantage and two consecutive wins in tournament action over UCF, FIU  was clearly favored to walk away with a win once again. But, the unexpected occurred, and the soccer playoffs quickly swung into the off-season. 

"[UCF] just decided to defend," head coach Karl Kremser said, explaining the difference between the last two matches against the opposing team.

The Golden Panthers played well but came up just short in a 1-0 loss to the Golden Knights, providing the first upset of this year's tournament. With six key seniors playing their final season, this was supposed to be FIU's year, and its top priority was an NCAA Championship. Yet, all goals and expectations came to an abrupt end in front of a sell out crowd.

"We just got really, really unlucky," said senior Jared Rose.

The Golden Panthers dominated all phases of the match, out shooting UCF 14-3 and holding a 12-3 advantage in corner kicks. 

But, with a few great saves, a couple of goal posts hit and several missed scoring chances, the Golden Knights turned their fortune around and prevailed for the improbable win. 

"We played well, moved the ball, had great chances, but they just played great defense," Kremser said.

The lone goal of the match came during the 25:08 mark, when UCF freshmen Scott Baron scored his first collegiate goal on a surprising play. 

"It was a good shot that just found its way into the net," Rose said.

Barron dribbled the ball past defenders and took a shot at the net. When other players shielded FIU goalkeeper Shawn Crowe, the ball rolled into the left side of the net, establishing the game-winning goal. This goal surprised Kremser.

"They only had three shots, and the easiest one just went in," Kremser said.

The Golden Panthers came out strong in the second half and continued to attack with  persistency. The team created numerous scoring opportunities, as most chances were near goals with shots barely missing the net. 

The best chance took place when senior Lucas Scudeler took a rebound and drilled the ball past defenders and out of the goalie's reach, but the ball sailed just wide of the net. 

Crowe finished the game with one save in 90:00 minutes;  UCF's Ryan McIntosh collected five saves, including a couple of difficult ones that saved the game and secured the victory.

With the loss FIU ended the season with an 11-7-0 record, while UCF improved to 11-6-2 and advanced to the second round, where it will take on the top-seeded Wake Forest.

Headline: College stress triggers depression
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Today, I felt like committing suicide. I wasn't crying or curled up into the fetal position when I felt this; I was just walking to class. 

It was a mental lightning bolt - a momentary glimpse into a part of myself I chose to ignore. 

This wasn't the first time I felt this way. Like many, when my personal problems begin to snowball, I figure there is no point to life at all. 

The daily routine begins to wear on me mentally and physically. When I view my life this way, I begin to feel like a failure, a cycle begins, and that bottle of sleeping pills in my medicine cabinet begins to look more appealing.

According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, I'm in good company.  Suicide is currently the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S. Every day about 80 Americans take their own lives, and about 1,500 attempt to do so.

At my most cynical, I think, "What's one more?" Or I figure that this suicide epidemic is just the modern survival of the fittest, but there must be a better reason.

The AFSP cites depression as the primary cause of suicide. It causes about 60 percent of all suicide deaths every year. Approximately 19 million Americans suffer from depression, but only one in three people actually get help to treat it. 

So, about 66 percent of depressed people just stay depressed? That's ... depressing.

I figure that only a third of depressed people are getting help for depression because only a third of them want to admit that they have a problem. 

I find that the American people have an obsession with keeping a calm and collected exterior while their interior is falling to pieces. 

College students are a good example. We join fraternities, play sports and write for newspapers, while carrying jobs and good GPAs and trying to keep our sanity. We're expected to be super-human. It's no wonder that nearly 10 percent of all suicides are committed from the ages 20 to 24. 

The beginning of the holiday season marks a rise in depression and suicide. 

Crumbling semester grades, being around a dysfunctional family, having a tedious seasonal job, or realizing there will be no New Year's kiss, can bog one down. However, there is reason to survive, even if the reason is to look for a reason. The first thing one must do is realize he/she needs help.

So with all of my pride aside, I'm going to seek treatment for this. When you're at rock bottom, you have nothing left to lose, right?

Headline: Board of Governors debate; delays FIU's medical school hearing
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
Seated around a room in the Turlington Building, Tallahassee, on Nov. 18, FIU administrators and faculty members sat through a lengthy Board of Governors meeting in order to submit a presentation regarding the university's plan to establish a public medical school in South Florida.

The meeting was originally supposed to have been held in Pensacola, but due to the damage the city sustained this past hurricane season, it was moved to Tallahassee.

At 8 a.m. that morning, FIU presented its case for a doctoral program in public health to the Board, which approved the program with only one vote against it.

From 12:30 p.m. until 3 p.m., university representatives then sat through various presentations from other schools and commissioners, ready to display their own medical school Power Point slide show in the ten minutes the board alloted them.

Hours came and went, and though some university affiliates managed to say a few words, the official presentation was never delivered.

"Immediately after our representatives from our affiliated hospitals made their statements, most people headed for the doors, and in five or ten minutes, the meeting was over," said Thomas Breslin, vice provost for the Academic Affairs Office.

The administrative heads of Mt. Sinai, Miami Children's and Mercy hospitals, as well as FIU Board of Trustees member Herbert Wertheim, discussed the positive impact a medical school would have on South Florida with the board, but there was no time left for Maidique's slide show.

"The meeting was very long, and it got bogged down a little bit in the discussion of some board policies," Breslin said.

During several debates, the Board of Governors spent much time discussing their constitutional authority to set tuition and to approve professional schools and doctoral programs, all powers held by the State Legislature.

These discussions, however, took a great deal of time from the meeting. Because of this, the university agreed to reschedule its presentation for Jan. 27 of next year. Maidique will again be the program's spokesman.

"This will at least give us more time to focus on ways to improve our proposal," Breslin said.

The proposal would have discussed the need for local doctors to care for a community primarily composed of senior citizens, a large population of people from foreign countries and poor residents without health insurance.

"In our opinion, Florida needs at least two or three new public medical schools. Right now, the question at the state level is how to get the most doctors in the field as quickly as possible," Breslin said.

With two months left to prepare their case again, Breslin is sure that FIU will have more time to plan how they will explain their goals to the board.

Later in spring, the University of Central Florida will present its own medical school proposal. Florida State University will also propose an extension to their program in January by establishing a chiropractic school.

Headline: Carbon monoxide: More dangerous than you think
Author: Luisa Cabrera / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Since the deaths of FIU students Tony Perez and Janelle Bertot on Nov. 14 from carbon monoxide intoxication, the nation has paid greater attention to the dangers of this invisible poison.

The gas, which is emitted when fuel is burned, binds to a person's red blood cells and prevents the flow of oxygen to the body's tissues after one inhales it. Soon after, the victim begins to experience a drowning sensation.  

The majority of fuel-burning products emit small doses of carbon monoxide, including barbecue grills, cars, household heaters and even fire extinguishers and cigarettes.

"A smoker inhales a little, no big problem.  But if someone is exposed to a lot of carbon monoxide, in essence, you become asphyxiated," said John Landrum, a chemistry professor.

The problem, however, is that most people don't realize when they are being exposed to potentially lethal amounts of the gas.

"Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless," said Robert Dollinger, executive director of the University Park Health Services and professor of health and lifestyles. "Most people don't know they're being affected until it's too late. They go to sleep [near the gas] and never wake up."

Adding to the risk is the fact that the poisoning can take place where one least expects it.

"It could happen anywhere: in your house, in your car, if you're working with fuel-burning machines. People need to be aware," said Dollinger, who also happened to be Bertot's professor in a premedicine class.

The National Poison Control Center recommends that if a person believes he or she has suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, that person should call an ambulance immediately. Signs that indicate poisoning include: dizziness, shortness of breath, headache and extremely pink lips. If the victim ignores these symptoms, the intoxication might lead to unconsciousness, brain damage and possibly death.

"If you are [in a situation where] more than one person begins to display symptoms, you should never dismiss carbon monoxide poisoning as a possibility," Landrum said.

Since most accidents relating to the gas tend to occur in vehicles, people should have a mechanic check their car for a faulty exhaust system.

Fixing the problem may be as simple as replacing a gasket or welding some cracks in the gears; though some cars' exhaust systems should be completely replaced.

 "Most of the time, people aren't even allowed to drive cars with faulty exhaust systems," Landrum said, "But sometimes, they go unnoticed."

Besides cars, another major source of carbon monoxide poisoning comes from sealed-off houses.

"Every year, you hear cases where three or four family members are rushed to the hospital because they've left their heaters on too long," Landrum said.

He also stated that ventilation is necessary for all homes to fully release unwanted gases.

What people should remember, though, is that carbon monoxide poisoning is preventable.

"If you feel dizzy, nauseous, or even tired, it may be as simple as cracking a window," Dollinger said.

"If you get out of your car and walk around, you may notice you feel better right away."

Headline: BBC Housing sponsors Thanksgiving pageant
Author: Katherine Beale / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Wolfe Center Ballroom at the Biscayne Bay Campus became a runway Nov. 18, as Bay Vista Housing presented its third annual Lights Out fashion show and Thanksgiving dinner. The show included different categories of clothing: cultural, denim, vintage, sportswear, swimwear and formal wear. It also featured fashions by C. Madeline, Cache, Feugo and After Hours, as well as pieces designed by the students themselves. Between fashion categories, the audience relaxed during brief intermissions and musical performances.

Audience response was strong throughout the show. The loudest cheers went to the models who dared to wear the most revealing or unconventional ensembles. Swimwear was extremely popular with the audience, but nothing could top the show's grand finale. Allure Infiniti, a senior who majors in hospitality management, appeared in his replica of Madonna's first dress from the 2004 Reinvention Tour. It is hard to describe the ensemble. 

It looked like an East-meets-west cross between a white,  American wedding dress and a red, Indian wedding dress. It was festooned with a gold sequined trim, tassel fringes, red home décor fabric and white tule. Full-length white gloves, flawless makeup and a red headdress completed the look. When Infiniti effortlessly strolled to the end of the runway, he lifted up his floor-length skirt to reveal four-inch red stilettos, earning him murmurs of admiration from many of the audience's female members. "He makes that look easy!" one woman whispered.

Overall, the audience's reaction to the show was positive.

Bay Vista Resident Assistant (RA) Rasheedah Muhammad spoke glowingly of the effort the participants put into the show. "I'm really impressed," she said, "This is the best Lights Out to date." 

Other students felt that this year's show didn't quite live up to the standard set by shows in previous years.  "I liked last year's fashion show better," said Jason Gellar, a sophomore majoring in journalism. "I thought there was more variety to the costumes ... and that Panther square was a better setting for the events [than the WUC ballroom]."

What everyone seemed to agree on, however, was the hard work it took to plan and carry out the event.  "This took a lot of work," said Samson Tirfagnehu, RA and sophomore majoring in hospitality management. "We've been practicing for weeks. A lot of housing leaders have been helping us out up to the moment the fashion show went on.  It shows what the residents can do."  

RA and senior Orville Ingram, explained that after participating last year, he wanted to take a more active role in the event's planning this year. Ingram was in charge of donations and apparel for the show.  "It was really a lot of work, but we all worked as a team," he said. 

Despite the hard work, Ingram says he enjoyed the show and liked the outfits he wore on the runway. "The denim was my favorite tonight, but the After-Hours suit is a classic," he said. "Suits tend to bring out the gentleman in me."

The event's moonlight garden theme had special significance for its organizers, who saw the event as a celebration of diversity.  "It represents harmony blended together to form something beautiful," Delaney said.

Headline: Thanksgiving in Miami
Subheadline: Turkey tradition fuses with Latino influences
Author: Carlos C. Olaechea / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a recent article in Gourmet magazine, Lillian Chou offered interesting ethnic recipes for the Thanksgiving smorgasbord to accompany the traditional turkey. I guess the magazine's editors considered this to be a new idea: pairing traditional American dishes with international ones during a typically American holiday.  

Obviously, Chou hasn't spent much time in Miami.  However, her recipes did get me thinking about the ethnic additions that Miamians put on their Thanksgiving tables. 

It also got me thinking about the regional differences in Thanksgiving meals across the nation.

Unbeknownst to some, the U.S. has regional cuisine that extends even to the Northern states. 

I had to learn this the hard way when I asked my stepmother from Ala. why she didn't prepare the same dishes that my mother from NH did. Her reply was simply, "Well, I just don't cook Yankee food, honey." 

This, of course, refuted my provincial South American idea that the U.S. was composed of New York City, Texas and Hollywood. 

There are many more regions that possess their own Thanksgiving traditions. I later learned that my mother's Yankee dishes, like dressing made from wheat bread (as opposed to the standard cornbread dressing of the South), Harvard beats, succotash and fresh cranberry sauce, will never be found on my Southern stepmother's Thanksgiving table. 

Likewise, Southern Thanksgiving standards like pecan pie and biscuits wouldn't dare be present at a respectable Yankee Thanksgiving meal. 

Alcoholic punches, common at Northern Thanksgiving celebrations, are hardly ever found in the Bible Belt, where dry counties continue to exist to this day. 

In parts of Western Pennsylvania, which has a large German-American population, a Thanksgiving table might look more like an Oktoberfest to the untrained eye, with specialties like Rotkohl (red cabbage slaw), Spaetzle (German-style pasta), and Kartoffelnsalat (German potato salad).

As Miami is a meeting place of the Americas, it offers its own Thanksgiving specialties.  Many people from the Spanish Caribbean will probably tell you that they have roast pork for Thanksgiving, in addition to the traditional turkey. Many times, as is the case with my Dominican friend's family, the turkey is just for ceremony and is never eaten. 

For some Miami families the turkey is also a symbol of their new life in the U.S., as they adopt American traditions. Still others choose to have just a turkey and forgo the pork, and many families eat only foreign side dishes with their turkey. 

For some people, however, bringing foreign foods to the Thanksgiving table is a sacrilege. During a Thanksgiving dinner she hosted a few years ago, my stepmother gracefully maintained her Southern belle composure while her Cuban guests placed dishes of boiled yucca, platanos maduros and arroz congri next to her macaroni and cheese and green bean casserole. Only after the guests departed did she express her disappointment at the travesty committed that evening. 

"You do not bring Cuban food to a Thanksgiving dinner," she stated, setting a precedent that would bar anyone from making any ethnic modifications or additions to future Thanksgiving dishes. 

Many Americans, however, are open to the idea of including food inspired by different cultures at their table during this holiday. 

Surely you will find some families that  have a bottle of Spanish wine at their table, and they may even end the meal with a French-inspired cheese board.

This Thanksgiving I'm going to visit my stepmother's family in Alabama. I will sample some very fresh, typical Southern Thanksgiving dishes, including a myriad of desserts that will probably include a selection of about five different pies, not including each aunt's rendition of the quintessential pecan pie. 

Along with the food, there will be the Southern traditions that accompany the meal, which tend to be a more understated than the ones we are used to in Miami, like celebrating late into the night with lots of music, dancing and beer.
