&nbsp;
The School of Hospitality Management at the Biscayne Bay Campus celebrated its sixth annual University Fête Oct. 7, a unique festival celebrating the traditions, food and entertainment of the Caribbean.

Mohammad A. Qureshi, the school's manager of facilities, said that close to 2,500 people attended the event.

The exact amount of tickets sold was not known as of press time.

Qureshi was assisting Associate Dean Lee Dickson in this event, supervising student volunteering in conjunction with Angostura, Trinidad and Tobago's largest bottling company.

"The event helped students learn different techniques on how to put an event like this together," Qureshi said.

Victoria Fernandez, a junior majoring in hospitality and management said that she enjoyed the event because she got the opportunity to put into practice her skills in this area.

"I got the opportunity to work with Chef Ketly. She was the one in charge of the FIU dish," Fernandez said. 

"This event would benefit [both] the Angostura Scholarship Fund for international students and students at the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management. Plus. This event is also a great opportunity for networking." 

About $10,000 of the event's proceeds would go towards scholarships funds, Qureshi said. 

CL Financial, Angostura's parent company, recently donated almost $300,000 to the school's audiovisual department.

"As a sign of appreciation, we named one of our classrooms after Angostura," Qureshi said.

Wayne Rodriguez, Angostura event organizer and supervisor, said that he expected the carnival party to turn out well. 

"Island people come here to enjoy and have a great time; and this is what I want," Rodriguez said.

This event - called a "Red Carpet Affair" by its organizers - is the leading social and cultural event of Miami-Dade and Broward County's Carnival Weekend, Rodriguez said.

Trinidadian tourist Emmanuel Johnson enjoyed the party because he loves Soca music, which is a mix of Trinidad's calypso and Indian music.

 "I am here in Miami for the first time," Johnson, 38, said. "The food and the music here are great."

The Fête featured a diverse blend of authentic Caribbean food and entertainment, which included Chinese, East Indian and Creole. 

Hospitality majors got a chance to serve some of their signature dishes.

 "The spaghetti and shrimp [was] delicious," said Lisa Jones, a 27-year-old Jamaican resident of South Florida. She said that she was here for entertainment, drinks and mingling.

The host for Fête 2006 was Maxine Williams, film and theater celebrity who hosts events on Black Entertainment Television and other productions.

DJs Giselle the Wassy One of 96.1 FM and D'Soca General from Trinidad Power 102 FM, as well as bands T & TEC Gaytones, David Rudder and Roger George kept guests entertained and dancing through the night.

"I would love to come again next year," Johnson said.

Headline: Organization gives children hope
Author: Yolanne Almanzar / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Firefighters, doctors, TV reporters, actors - with the help of the FIU Chapter of the Association for Women in Communications, 20 children from the Child Hope organization will be able to experience these and other professions Oct. 21.

Formerly known as the Christian Homes for Children, Child Hope is a non-profit organization that provides foster care for abused, abandoned and neglected children.

The AWC first became involved with Child Hope 11 years ago when the organization came to the University asking for some help in getting the organization's name out to the community. 

"It started as a class assignment," said Margo Berman, the AWC Student Advisor, who presented the challenge to her classroom.

After Berman's students were successful in getting Child Hope on the radio, in the newspaper and other mediums, Berman continued to stay involved and eventually, the AWC picked up where her classes left off. 

Laura Molina, senior and vice president of special projects for AWC, feels that they are meeting the purpose of the organization: giving back to the community.

"We also want [the kids at Child Hope] to feel inspired to do something else with their lives, just like we are," Molina said.

Alina Balean, president of AWC, shared what her advisor told her about these children's pasts.  "Think about the worst thing you could do to your child, and then think of something worse," Balean said.

The families of Child Hope live in communities where the children play, learn and receive spiritual guidance.

The organization is also a highly regulated one, not allowing the children to go on any field trips without their parents transporting and chaperoning them, so as to protect the children's identities.  

Despite such restrictions, the AWC has organized an array of events for the children, including Disney on Ice, trips to the Miami Seaquarium and IMAX theaters, bowling parties, magic shows and pony rides.

"Every year we try to do some special event for these children, especially during the time of year when most people don't think about them," Berman said.

Senetta Carter, director of education at Child Hope, felt there were many benefits of the AWC's efforts. 

"Kids get to see that there's a different side of life and that there are people that do care about them," Carter said. 

At Wannado City, an interior theme park in Sawgrass Mills Mall in Sunrise - where they'll be taken Oct. 21 - the children earn a check, can set up bank accounts and spend their money as they deem fit.

They're also able to immerse themselves in various job fields.

 "Wannado City is so relevant because we show these kids a brighter future after such a horrific yesterday," Berman said.

The AWC also works to provide its members opportunities at FIU.

Some of these services include resume and portfolio workshops, as well as graphic design classes to hone the skills they may need in the workforce.

Their work has allowed the FIU student chapter to be awarded the Outstanding Student Chapter of the Year in the nation four times.     

The club raises money for the cost of food for the day at Wannado City.

Through computer training workshops in Web Design, Photoshop and InDesign they're raising funds for the kids.  	

"The most important thing in the world is to give back- whether that's your money, talent or time," Berman said.

Headline: Down the Drain: Low morale, participation affect students
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With FIU's football game against the University of Miami approaching, many students - some who didn't even know we had a football team before the semester began - are all of a sudden quick to call Roary their best friend. Though there are FIU students who bleed blue and gold at times of competition, there always seem to be some individuals who, no matter the circumstances, will stop at nothing to show off their dislike for this University.

"I didn't know we had a football team until my cousin who goes to UM told me about the game against them," said freshman Ana Perdomo. "We're going to probably lose because we're FIU."

Some students share similar thoughts when it comes to perceptions of the University.

When asked to describe FIU in one word, junior Lily Hernandez chose "average." Hernandez is a transfer student from Florida State University and is currently in her second semester.

"I left FSU after two years because I heard a lot of good things about the chemistry department at FIU," Hernandez said. "My aunt lives down here, and she told me I could stay with her until I wanted, but I preferred to live in housing."

Hernandez was very involved on campus back in Tallahassee. She was a member of The Renegade yearbook staff, Gay Straight Alliance, Student Government Association and an employee of University Counseling Center. But at FIU, Hernandez is only taking classes.

"I went to all the club fairs in the summer and attended some meetings of clubs I was interested in, but the lack of spunk at FIU really gets to me," Hernandez said. "I remember one club in particular had a roster of 240 interested people. There were three at the meeting including myself. [It's] pathetic."

Hernandez also lived in housing at FSU and explained the differences between both residential communities.

"I could get up at anytime during the night at FSU and the hallways would be busting with life. Parties every night, people with their doors open - the expected. Here, you'll find a person reading in the lounge, if you're lucky, or a fight outside," Hernandez said.

According to Residential Life Director Joseph Mattachione, various attempts are being put forth to give housing students opportunities to meet new people and join clubs.

"We like to partner with other offices and plan socials and gatherings so students can meet other students," he said. "The main difference with FIU and other universities is that FIU is located in Miami. In other universities, most locales are walking distance from campus; here, you need a car to get around to most places."

Even though Hernandez admits she would be getting a better education here than at FSU, she plans on returning there for the Spring semester.

"A bachelor's degree is a bachelor's degree, no matter where you get it from. Something should be done to promote student togetherness and spirit at this place," Hernandez said.

Vivian Bretz, unlike Hernandez, was born and raised in Miami. She has never traveled outside the state of Florida and is very happy to be a Golden Panther.

"I watched a lot of TV when I was in elementary school. I remember seeing a lot of shows that portrayed college as a place where kids went to party and got drunk. That's it," Bretz said. "FIU isn't like that. I like that FIU is mostly a commuter school because we don't get the opportunity to be one of those stereotypical universities."

For out-of-state students, FIU can be a very different place. Ernesto Echevarria, a senior who is originally from Texas, explains that FIU is exactly what he envisioned college to be.

"I love FIU. I just wish more people felt the same way. It's kind of sad when I go to football games and barely any other students are there," Echevarria said. "This is a good place and I wish more people knew that. Everyone should make the most of their college experience instead of complain all the time."

Headline: Websites make nostalgic regression easy
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Students such as junior Jorge Valens occasionally reminisce about some of the television shows they watched during their childhood.

"Sometimes, I wonder what happened to all those cartoons I used to watch as a kid," he said. "Stuff like 'Duck Tales' and 'Darkwing Duck' were so cool back then, but I don't remember if they got canceled or something."

Fortunately for students trying to recapture some of their youth, websites such as RetroJunk.com and YouTube.com let students upload old commercials and television show clips they may have recorded or found taped at someone's garage sale. Whether you're searching for the introduction to Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie or just looking up some of your favorite cereal commercials, these websites have a library of media for people to explore for free. 

Websites such as YouTube rely on visitors for most of their media content. YouTube, for instance, lets anyone who signs up for a free account upload their own videos, which could include anything from home videos to recordings of television shows and movies. Similarly, Retro Junk requires potential uploaders to register their account before letting them add to the library of commercials, movies and television shows.

Sophomore Antonio Carrillo, an international student who frequents YouTube, uses the website as a means of watching the cartoons he missed out on as a child.

"Because I didn't grow up in this country, I never really got to see the types of cartoons that people here saw when they were growing up," he said. "The sites let me look up a lot of stuff my friends talk about when they talk about their childhoods."

Even though YouTube and Retro Junk allow visitors to upload and view content from past years, there are certain drawbacks. Both websites have limits on what type of content can be uploaded.

If you want to upload an entire episode of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" on Retro Junk, you're out of luck - the site is limited to television show introductions.

Although these multimedia websites let students watch whatever they want for no cost, there are other alternatives.

Recently, shows such as "Darkwing Duck" and "Thundercats" have been released on DVD to appease fans that want to see their favorite shows again. Unlike the free websites, this alternative could cost collectors a lot of money. The first two seasons of "Thundercats" bundled together on DVD is retailing for $259 when the bundle is released Nov. 28.

Junior Rajiv Kirpalani admits that the websites provide the only viable option for nostalgic yet budget-conscious students.

"Unless you can know someone who recorded the old stuff from the '80s and '90s, you're going to have a hard time finding it anywhere else," he said. "You might find some things for sale on eBay, but why pay for it if you can get it free?"

Headline: Trivial Pursuit...a pop culture column
Subheadline: Underdog theme marks modern films
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Look up "underdog" in the dictionary and you'll find a person who is expected to lose in a contest or conflict, be it sports, politics or in movies.

On Oct. 14, the FIU Golden Panthers face the University of Miami Hurricanes in what many sports analysts have already written off as a one-sided affair in favor of the Canes. Even the most die-hard FIU fans would agree that the Panthers aren't expected to win. A few already dub it the "Oct. 14 Massacre."

 In spite of all this, FIU expects more than 4,000 students decked out in blue and gold at the Orange Bowl on Saturday gunning for the Panthers.

Is it because of the hype? Have students going to the game bought in to the whole FIU vs. UM rivalry? I don't expect that to be the case. Some are going for the tailgate celebrations; some may be going to watch the Canes for free, and there are those who are going with the hope that the underdog will pull off an upset.

"They want to see the little person win because people are tired of the bigger person winning over and over," said junior Anne Marie Munoz. "People are tired of repetition." 

Hey, they can hope, right? After all, if you asked Hollywood, you'd get a billion confirmations - Miracle, Chariots of Fire, Bend it Like Beckham, Seabiscuit, Cinderella Man and every other cliché-ridden inspirational sports movie from Remember the Titans to Gridiron Gang.

"It pumps you up. It's an adrenaline rush," said junior Johnny Garcia who is majoring in athletics training. "When you're watching a sports movie, you have a feeling they're going to win, but you cheer them on anyway because it's fun."

To pinpoint where Hollywood's obsession with the underdog tale truly began is uncertain but they have certainly tried. Of the 10 highest grossing movies of all time, eight of them have themes addressing the underdog. In Star Wars, part of the small Rebel Alliance beat the evil galactic Empire.

In The Matrix, Neo and the rebels have to beat the machines that control the whole world; Captain Jack Sparrow and Will Turner almost single handedly beat the villainous Captain Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.

So what is it about the underdog that truly fascinates us?

The root of the underdog concept is American. America was created by individuals who wanted to avoid persecution by the religious majority in Europe. Rather than fight back, they moved across the Atlantic to start a new life. 

The Revolutionary War is perhaps the greatest underdog story in American history, where the small American rebel army led by George Washington defeated the great British Empire.

With a nation's history founded in the underdog theory, you can see why it's a popular concept.

Hollywood supports the underdogs because it's part of the American Dream.

With FIU now stepping into its own movie-like scenarios, expect me to be one of the 4000 students cheering on the Panthers, fingers crossed for a miracle.

Headline: Two students die in boat accident, one injured
Author: Monique Mattiace / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Two FIU students died last weekend in a boat accident on their way back from the Columbus Day Regatta in Biscayne Bay.

James "Jimmy" Noel-Pou and Monica Burguera, along with six others, were on a broken-down rental boat that was being towed back to land. A 35-foot powerboat hit the group's rental boat from behind causing a fatal accident, according to The Miami Herald.

Noel-Pou, whose body was found Oct. 9 floating in Biscayne Bay, was a few days away from celebrating his 24 birthday. He graduated in 2005, but was continuing at FIU as a graduate student in construction management, according to the FIU School of Engineering.

He twice served as president and vice president of the Tau Kappa Epsilon social fraternity, members said.

"He was caring, loving and always smiling," said Shoham Segal, a TKE member. The fraternity has chosen to celebrate Noel-Pou's birthday Oct. 14 and remember him the way he was.

TKE members said they have lost a family member, someone that was always willing to give the shirt off his back. 

Monica Burguera, of San Juan, Puerto Rico, was a 20-year-old business major. She was killed in the collision, according to The Miami Herald article.

"She was ambitious and had a full life ahead of her … I will never forget her and she will always be in my heart," said her friend Daniela Betancourt, a junior majoring in art. 

Betancourt's best memories with Burguera date back to a trip they took together a couple of years ago to Universal Orlando's Halloween Horror Nights.

"We had a lot of fun that night," she said.

She described her longtime friend as someone who always wore a bright smile.

"As much as it hurts, I know she is in a better place watching over us as," she said.

Burguera's wake took place Oct. 9 and she was buried Oct. 10 in Miami.

Burguera was with long-time boyfriend Andres Perez, 20, at the time of the accident, according to The Miami Herald. He survived and was taken to JMH where he is recovering from a shattered pelvis.

FIU President Modesto A. Maidique released a statement Oct. 9 about the tragic accident. 

 "All of us in the FIU family are deeply saddened by this weekend's tragedy which has touched us deeply. We extend our sympathy to the families of Ms. Burguera and Mr. Noel-Pou. For us, the loss of a student, or a classmate, is the loss of a friend and we mourn this loss. At the same time, we are praying for the quick and full recovery of Mr. Perez," he wrote.

He also wrote that counselors would be available at the University Counseling Center to help students through the loss.

Despite several attempts, Lieutenant Alfredo Escanio from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the government agency overseeing the accident's investigation, was unavailable for comment.

As of press time, there was no set time for Noel-Pou's funeral arrangements.

However, the TKE-hosted rememberance ceremony for Noel-Pou will be held at 5 p.m., Oct. 14 in the Graham Center.

Headline: LOOKING BACK
Subheadline: Maidique celebrates anniversary
Author: C. Joel Marino and Betsy Martinez / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
University President Modesto A. Maidique is a busy man.

Though sitting with The Beacon at his expansive office in Primera Casa at University Park, Maidique was quickly interrupted by an assistant who let him know a possible candidate for the deanship of the College of Medicine was waiting outside.

"Already?" Maidique gravely asked.

Apologizing for the interruption, the 66-year-old administrator jogged out of the office and returned 10 minutes later.

"I apologize, but it's my job," Maidique said with a broad smile.

After 20 years as FIU's president (his first day on the job was Oct. 12, 1986), Maidique seems to have made it his business to stay busy.

Under his leadership, FIU's enrollment rose from 16,000 students in the mid-80s to the current 37,000.

Prominent programs such as the College of Law and the recently approved College of Medicine were established, as well as the founding of a hospitality management and tourism school in China.

However, Maidique's years haven't been without controversy.

In 2004, the Department of Energy found $50 million in grant money unaccounted for by FIU's Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology. The case was quickly settled and rarely mentioned again.

From concerns over the role of the new College of Medicine to land deals and the terms of his new contract, Maidique spoke about some of the highs and lows of his years at FIU with The Beacon in an interview that will be serialized throughout October.



Q: The College of Medicine was finally approved by the Board of Governors earlier this year. What has the university done since then, what was the next step taken?

The first step that we took is to retain a search firm so that that search firm would help us to pick a dean.

We're almost in the same situation that the University was in 1968 when they were searching for a president … Now we have an enterprise that could be ultimately as significant to this community as the entire University.

Certainly the budget of the medical school research and all the other pieces could be as big as the budget for the University.

It would just provide tremendous synergy for our sciences, for public health, for nursing and other programs.

So picking that dean is one of the most important decisions in my life.

We have gotten a search committee, which is ably led by Divina Grossman, dean of nursing; we have a search firm identify 15 candidates that were put in front of the search committee; the search committee reduced that to five, and we're interviewing all five.

By the end of tomorrow, I will have interviewed four out of five.



Q: When will you know who you'll pick?

By Nov. 1, we will have made our decision, then the person has to make his or her decision to decided whether they're interested in coming.

We have a vast amount of knowledge in the medical health science field at the University, but we don't have anybody inside who is a candidate or who could be dean.

We need an expert, a leader, someone extraordinary in research, in administration, in clinical practice in all of the various pieces, business, that make for an effective dean.

So that's the most important thing that we've done and we're moving along very quickly, because the medical school was written into law in June and here we are in September and we already have five finalsists.



Q: The University will need to raise a lot of money. How much has been raised so far, and what are the methods being used?

Monies at this level, I have to be personally involved with the donor … We have raised, all told, $60 million for the medical school, but the real money will be coming from the state.

The state this year will hopefully fund us to the tune of $6 million a year, then $12 [million], then $18 [million], then close to $24 [million] over the next three years. So every year, the state contribution will increase.

Also, we hope to announce partnerships with other entities to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars within the next month.



Q: Can you specify what those entities are?

Hospitals, other groups that are involved in the health care area, but I can't give you anymore details in that. We expect that the month of October will be a phenomenal month for medical science at FIU.



Q: We have the College of Law, the College of Medicine, a school of architecture - are there any other target programs or school in the works?

There are always new Ph.Ds, the possibility of new schools, but I think we now have all of the pieces.

If you have an Erector set and you wanted to build the Leaning Tower of Pisa or whatever, you would need a bunch of pieces.

We have all the pieces now to build a great public University: we have 30 Ph.D programs, architecture, law and medicine, plus a bunch of ally programs.

Overall, we have over 100 majors, and if you look at graduate, undergraduate and doctorals, we have over 200 offerings.

It's as if you're given a chassis, well then you need to add an engine, then you need to add wheels, then you need to add seats. 

We've got the pieces now; now we need to make that car move.























Q: More than a year has passed since the Board of Trustees voted on an $11.5 million settlement with the federal government after the Department of Energy found $50 million in grant money unaccounted for by FIU's Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology. Is the University still making payments?

Initially, they wanted a huge amount of money. By, I think, a rather deft negotiation, we were able to reduce the penalty to about $11.5 [million]. It's important to know what we did wrong. What we did wrong, a lot of people do in their own accounting in their life. As a matter of fact, I often pay for a lunch and I don't have a receipt, so I don't get reimbursed. I often will buy a book for professional purposes and I don't have a receipt, so I don't get reimbursed. What we didn't do right is that we didn't properly account for the effort and time that was put into this federal contract, the bookkeeping. So they basically said, "You have all this money that you have spent that you have not properly kept records accounted for, so we're not going to pay you." In the end of the day, a clerical mistake, a mistake in not keeping good records [was made]. For those reasons, since we didn't do any terrible thing, just keeping bad records, we were able to get them to reduce the amount that we had to pay back to $11.5 million.

Q: Well, where are we getting the money from?

We were given an authorization from the state to take $200 million to pay salaries, to pay for equipment purchased, and what have you. The state very generously takes care of that for us and pays us about 2.5 percent. Okay, so 2.5 percent. Now think as though you've got $200 million. [Makes believe he's counting money] Oh! Now I'll take 2.5 percent. That doesn't sound like a very good deal. So we told the state, "Thank you for your help all these years." We now have the authority under the Board of Trustee's authority to take that money back. We will manage it. Now when you take money, a couple of hundred million, that would make 2.5 or even 2 percent, it's not that difficult to take that up to 5 percent without taking a lot of risks, a 5 percent return. If you take a couple of percent returns on $200 million - lets say the average balance is $100 just for argument's sake - you take 2 percent extra on $100 million you've got $2 million more. That will pay, because we agreed with the Health and Human Services who was doing the investigation, that we'll pay them off for a period of time, they didn't like that, so we went to a bank and borrowed the money and we paid them back. It's being paid by an improved returns on the investments of money that we didn't have control over before, so it doesn't affect students' fees, it doesn't affect education in general fees, it doesn't affect our donors; basically, it's being paid in a novel way.



Q: You mentioned earlier that there had been accounting errors and mistakes. Have new accounting policies been implemented?



It's a completely new system, new processes. The leadership of that center has been completely overhauled. The director of the center is no longer the director, the financial director in no longer the financial director. It has a new name, a new mission, a new direction and it's being tightly watched.



Q: Your contract with the University was extended this year. However, your new salary seems a little high when compared to other Florida university presidents. How do you justify this?



High? The president of the University of Central Florida, our peer, got a salary of $450,000, got a bonus of $100,000 and got a retention bonus of $210,000. If you can add those numbers, that's $750,000, plus several other perks that I didn't total up brought the contract up to $900,000. Most of our trustees think that they have significantly undershot relative to the competition, so it's just the other way around, the market's going in the other direction. The president of the University of South Florida's contract is being worked. I would hazard a guess that after all the contracts are done, I'd be lucky to be averaging the state amongst these other presidents, and we are one of the largest universities in the state, so that's not the case at all.



Q: Why did the University try to sell 26-acres of land in Biscayne?



So we can get scholarships for guys like you. That land sale might have given us $150 million in addition to our endowments. If you take $150 million and you use it for endowments that's 5 percent, that'd be $7.5 million. There are various ways to cut that, but if you cut it at a thousand, that'd be 7,500 scholarships per year for $1,000 or 2,500 scholarships at $3,000. Those scholarships would've gone either to needy students or to excellent students. That was the only purpose of that. It was trading land for endowment and endowment for scholarships.



Q: What is FIU planning to do with the land now that it's not for sale?



Well, who said it wasn't?



Q: So where does the case stand?



The authority for that is the legislature. If you look at my record, you'll see I never give up. It may be in hibernation, but it's not out of the question. It's some of the most attractive land in the state of Florida, it's right there on the water at Biscayne Bay.



Q: Do you have any other plans for the Biscayne Bay Campus? Some people seem to perceive it as the "forgotten campus."



I never forget it. The best person to ask that question to is [new BBC vice-provost] Damien Fernandez. The fact that we have appointed a hard-driving, a tough, forward-looking guy who developed a plan for the future of the campus means that that campus has an exciting future.



Q: What progress has been made at FIU's School of Hospitality campus in Tianjin, China?



With the China deal, two years ago, I was there to place the cornerstone, they said that in two years, the campus would be done. I said it couldn't happen, but now two years later, almost to the day, I was back there, the campus is built, there are some students there, and the program is going. 



Q: When is the first class expected to begin?



In two years. They try to get two years at the Tianjin University of Commerce, then they're transitioning to us. I expect to be there again to see this in two years.



Q: Will FIU students be able to take classes at this campus?



Yup, we expect some FIU students to go to China. China is the next big thing in the world, and we also expect Chinese students to come here.

Headline: Honors convocation draws 400
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
The sixth annual Honors College Convocation was held Oct. 9, an event meant to showcase the Honors College and its students.   

The festivities began with the traditional March of Nations parade in which Honors College students held roughly 80 flags from various countries and United State. The flags represented the nations and states from which many students herald.

"I think it's a great thing," said Honors College Fellow Martha Baranton. "My heart swelled with pride." 

The parade also consisted of Faculty Fellows-professors that either teach and/or participate in the Honors College- the FIU marching band and ROTC. 

"I'm part French, so I chose to bear France's flag," said Honors College freshman Eugenio Barreto.  

The parade began at the Chapman Plaza in University Park and made its way to the housing quad, where the FIU marching band played a few songs.

The parade then continued to the water fountain next to Primera Casa and the Torch of Knowledge. There, the flag bearers circled the fountain and listened to the marching band play several more songs including an altered version of the FIU fight song.

"We never get to see stuff like this," said freshman Carolina Miranda while the parade was circling the water fountain.

When the songs were over, the parade made its way to the Graham Center Ballrooms for the next part of the Honors College Convocation.

"We actually started working on the parade at the end of July," said Parade Coordinator Charmaine DeFrancesco. "The whole point of the parade was to demonstrate the diversity of the Honors College." 

Spirits were high as Honors College students filled the GC ballrooms. Nearly every seat in the ballrooms was filled as students eagerly awaited the various speakers.

Lesley Northup, the Interim Dean of the Honors College, began with the following message, "Turn off your cell phones." 

When the laughter subsided, as well as the chimes of cell phones being turned off, Northup continued.

"This is a celebration of excellence," Northup said. "I also hope this is a celebration of integrity."  

A proclamation from Miami-Dade Commissioner Katie Sorenson then made Oct. 9, 2006 Honors College Day throughout Miami-Dade County.

"There is something special about today," said Associate Honors College Dean John Kneski. "This day is the only opportunity we have to see each other as a community."

The highlight of the convocation was the awards portion. There were ten categories for Honors students to enter: 2D art, 3D art, media/graphic art, science paper, photography, music performance/composition, poetry, research paper, personal/journal essay and critical essay.

"I felt really good," said freshman Christine Fitzgerald after she won second place in the Three Dimensional Art category.

Her entry was a research paper that was put into the form of a book with a doorknob on its cover and was filled with various objects.

"It took me eight months to do it," Fitzgerald said.  

The awards portion also included several musical numbers that were played by various Honors College students.

"Even though it ran a little late, I liked the musical performances," said sophomore Carolyn Andrade.

There were over 400 people in attendance, most wearing the trademark white Honors College polo shirt.

"Today's ceremony was fabulous compared to last year's," said Adjunct Professor Mary Lou Pfeiffer. "I've never had so much fun in my teaching life."

At the end of the day, members of the Honors College left the convocation with a feeling of satisfaction.

"Working for the Honors College is like working with family. And being a member has given me a lot of privileges," said Senior Isabel Sanchez. "I'm sad that I'm graduating soon."

Headline: Professor has passion for trains, Florida
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
If you're looking for a renowned Florida historian, you need only to walk to Deuxiem Maison in University Park and visit Associate Professor of History Seth Bramson.

Brian Peterson, associate professor of history, brought Bramson to FIU in 2005. Bramson started teaching at FIU during the Summer B session of 2005. Since then, he has become a top-rated professor among students, according to Peterson.

"The students love him. He uses his influence to get students into places they would normally not have access to for field trips. He has even allowed classes to visit his home to view his private collections," Peterson said.

His students agree that his passion for the subject is what keeps the classes interesting.

"He loves history and makes you love it, too," said senior Ricardo Laurenti. "He came highly recommended by other students."

While Bramson receives words of praise from his students, he has the same opinions about them.

"After teaching for 12 years at St. Thomas and five years at Johnson and Wales … it's great [to be] here [at FIU]. The students are more interested and their work is better," Bramson said.  

During office hours Bramson often critiques students' papers line by line with them, in order for them to rewrite the paper for a better grade.

"It's not what to think, it's how to think" is one of Bramson's teaching mottos.

Teaching is one of Bramson's passions, but it pales in comparison to his infatuation with Florida's history.

Bramson has been collecting Florida memorabilia since he was 13-years-old. He began collecting memorabilia of the Florida East Coast Railway and today his collection consists of over a million artifacts and is the largest in the world, according to Bramson. 

He also has one of the largest private collections of Miami memorabilia and Floridiana in America.

Of his 201 photographs of Miami, fewer than 10 have ever been published. Because of his passion for history, Bramson has become the Florida East Coast Railway's official historian. 

On top of his expansive collection of historical artifacts, Bramson is also a best selling author. His latest book, Coral Gables, went out of print in two weeks, a first for the Image of America series of books, according to Bramson. 

"It's the first and only history of Coral Gables," Bramson said. "There have been several books about parts of Coral Gables, but none about its complete history."

Bramson debuted his latest book Sept. 25 at the Books & Books shop located in Coral Gables. According to the store's owner, Mitchell Kaplan, the debut was a huge success.

"We had over 100 people in attendance including the Mayor of Coral Gables Don Slesnick II and the former Mayor Raul Valdes-Fauli," Kaplan said. "We have also sold several hundred copies of Bramson's new book already." 

While Bramson is very proud of the books he has written, students said he never tries to push those books in class.  

"He mentioned them once, but he doesn't push his books," said senior Carlos Mejia. 

"He made it a point in class to say that it was unethical for him to make us buy his books. The only time I had to read a book professor Bramson wrote was because it was the only book on the subject," Laurenti said.  

 When it comes to Florida's history. Professor Bramson is right at the top. Students commented that it's rare for a professor passionate about something, to be adequately able to convey those feelings of passion to students. 

Bramson has done so and plans to continue his two great passions: teaching and collecting historic memorabilia.

Headline: FIU gets new athletic director
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
In a surprise move, University officials announced the appointment of a new athletic director just four days before the anticipated football match between FIU and the University of Miami.

Pete Garcia, UM's senior associate athletic director for external operations, was introduced as the new director at a press conference Oct. 10 and will officially take over the position Oct. 16.

"Pete is a truly extraordinary man, who has served [UM] extremely well," said University President Modesto A. Maidique at the press conference. "He is an expert in recruiting [and] is going to lead the University into a new era in athletics."

Former Athletic Director Rick Mello, who received a five-year contract extension in May, will become associate vice president and executive director of the FIU Athletics Finance Corporation. He will oversee the $34 million expansion of the football stadium at University Park along with the adjacent $24 million student support complex.

"[University officials] feel like the program can be taken to the next level with Pete as athletic director and me in charge of the stadium," Mello said in an interview with The Beacon.

According to a University-wide email from Marcos Perez, vice president of external relations, the corporation was recently "approved and designated by the Board of Trustees as a Direct Support Organization for the University to undertake the financing and construction of the expansion of the FIU football stadium" and new student support complex.

Mello said his salary would remain the same. However, the money for his salary will come from the corporation instead of the athletic department.

Still, Mello also said that the announcement took him by surprise. He did not know that changes were in the works and was notified of the reappointment Oct. 8, just a few days before the official announcement.

"I'm surprised and disappointed, but I'm going to put forth all my effort into building the stadium," he said.

Maidique praised Mello in the press conference for what he has done for the athletics department during his six-year tenure, including doubling the athletics budget, establishing the FIU football program and its quick progression to Division I-A.

He has also secured football matches against top teams like the University of Florida in 2009 and Penn State in 2007.

He was also a main player in getting FIU to play its first football series against UM, the first game which will take place Oct. 14. The next game will be in 2007.

The stadium and the student services complex are expected to be completed by 2010. Considering that he will have one year left on his contract after this presumed deadline, Mello said he does not know what he will be doing after that.

"We'll worry about that when the time comes," he said.

He also said if another athletic director's position were offered to him by another university, "It would have to be a damn good offer" for him to leave FIU.

"I put my heart and soul into this program, and I really want to see this project finish," Mello said.

Garcia, who has a degree in business administration from UM, said he was honored to even be considered for the position and wants to improve the athletics program.

"One of the things that I would like to do in my career is establish an elite sports program at [FIU] that [the South Florida community] can rally behind and be proud of," Garcia said. "We gotta get back our own. And what I mean by that is we have close to 40,000 students here. We have over 100,000 alumni in South Florida [and] those are the ones we gotta get to support our program in every way."

At UM, Garcia was in charge of ticket sales, media relations, marketing and the management of all major contract negotiations with corporations such as Nike, Gatorade and Coca-Cola.

Garcia would not say for what team he would be rooting for in the FIU/UM football game.

"This Saturday, I don't know if I'm going to the game," Garcia said in Spanish after the press conference. "I'll probably be staying home."

Headline: Education can save a boy's life
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Cars and murder aren't the only things killing our nation's boys in record numbers: boys are killing themselves. Compelling statistics from the Center for Disease Control show that they are committing suicide at higher rates; something is troubling our nation's boys. 

So how big is this problem for boys when compared with girls? Feminists argue that girls are the ones who need more help; girls are attempting suicide more often, which feminists point out is a result of a patriarchal culture in American that destroys the self-esteem of girls.

However, while girls are attempting suicide more, boys are actually going through with it more often - a boy is over four times more likely to kill himself than a girl. The suicide rate is increasing for boys around the age that they are entering or applying for college.

Why do American boys think they have fewer reasons to live?   

Education in America is revealing the gender gap between boys and girls. In high schools, more girls than boys are taking up leadership positions, Advanced Placement classes and membership into honor societies - all are big factors in predicting success in college.

"The average 11th grade boy writes like an 8th grade girl. He's far more likely to drop out, to flunk, to not go to college than the girl sitting next to him," said Christina Hoff Summers, a member of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education in her book, "The War Against Boys.:

In an interview on CBS' 60 Minutes, Lesley Stahl, a journalist for the program, reported that college campuses are on average 60 percent female, and this gap is widening as long as our nation remains blind to the plight of American boys.

"After decades of special attention, girls are soaring, while boys are stagnating," said Dr. Michael Thompson, a school psychologist, in the same interview. While girls have needed our help in the past and still do today, the same is now especially true for boys in this era.  Boys need the extra attention in schools because literacy can keep them out of trouble. If you can read and understand this, your chances of dying or ending up in prison are a whole lot lower than those of a boy who can't.   

Thompson attributes the problem facing boys to the absence of positive male figures in their education. Boys need men in their lives to help them deal with the modern pressures of masculinity.  There are too few male figures in education that boys can look up to. How many men who liked poetry and art did you see while going to school? 

There are solutions out there that can give boys hope: Jefferson Academy in Long Beach, California has a 1:1 ratio of male and female teachers.  In class, boys and girls are segregated to meet their specific educational needs. In the United Kingdom, they have implemented more all-boys schools and programs to help boys read and write better. The result: boys' test scores are improving.

American boys face new problems in our time; there is no doubt about that.  Boys are lagging behind and speeding recklessly toward an ever-widening chasm of gender inequality while society ignores the signs. Boys are falling behind in morals, self-esteem and education. 

It's boys who are facing down the barrel of guns and searching for meaning. If our nation continues to ignore their pleas, the answer we are giving them is a resounding "bang."

Subheadline: Abortion a question of science, not choice
Author: Julie Sierra / Senior / English Major
&nbsp;
The abortion battle is one that cannot be ignored, regardless of whether or not you believe women should have the right to have an abortion. I also think it's important to understand that the real issue behind abortion has less to do with choice and more to do with one vital question: is a fetus in fact a human being? That question should be answered based on a scientific and philosophical basis. I challenge you, as a well-educated college student or professional, to find out for yourself. Is a fetus a human being? Stay informed, don't just follow the crowd on this issue.

Subheadline: New metrorail could overcrowd FIU
Author: Anthony Rionda / Junior / Marketing Major
&nbsp;
I'm amazed by the continued support for a Metrorail line on the 107th Avenue side of the [University Park] campus. 

It is amazing that we would want the millions of dollars spent to alleviate traffic with the 16th Street exit to 107th [Avenue], as well as improving the school's athletics over the last few years to go to waste.

Those who want a huge traffic calamity along 107th Avenue during construction will support this initiative, which is being promoted by the administration and most of the student body. 

A station on the far west side of campus would force the school and community to improve the infrastructure, lighting and safety on that side of campus, and might also lead to a University-wide transportation system, [similar to] University of Miami's "Hurri- cane" buses. 

The construction of the Metrorail [station] alongside the turnpike would not be an enormous burden on commuters, would lead to the construction of Metrorail parking garages and would increase safety around the campus, especially in that particularly ignored part of campus. 

I would not want our already stressed-out lives to be put under more stress with heavier traffic, parking chaos, more theft or create an even larger sense of being a commuter school with the Metrorail on 107th Avenue.

Subheadline: FIU athletic director switch handled poorly
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
University President Modesto A. Maidique announced at a press conference Oct. 10 that Athletic Director Rick Mello will be replaced by Pete Garcia of the University of Miami. Mello will now be in charge of overseeing the expansion of the football stadium at University Park.

University officials attempted to sell the deal as a promotion for Mello. Despite the pretense of giving him another position, it seems to The Beacon that Mello was, for all practical purposes, fired.

 We have no objection with Mello's removal.Though Mello accomplished many goals during his six-year tenure - such as establishing the FIU football program and overseeing its quick progression to Division I-A - marquee sports such as football, baseball and basketball underperformed. Whether this is Mello's fault or not, the failure still reflects on him.Mello was clearly not the right person to head FIU's athletic program.

All this was presumably the reasoning behind the administration's decision to replace Mello with Garcia, UM's senior associate athletic director for external operations. The way in which the University handled Mello's replacement, however, is reprehensible.

The University had just given Mello a five-year contract exension in May. We believe that, unable to fire Mello outright, University officials gave him the position of associate vice president and executive director of the FIU Athletics Finance Corporation. This postion may become obsolete once the stadium is built, before his contract expires.

The inevitable question that arises is whether this was a position that needed to be filled, regardless of Mello's replacement, or whether the position was created because the University didn't know what to do with Mello after replacing him. After all, financing the stadium's expansion should be the responsibility of the new athletic director.

The University acted underhandedly in waiting until Oct. 8 - only two days before the press conference in which the change was announced - to tell Mello he was about to fired. In an interview with The Beacon, Mello acknowledged he was surprised and disappointed by the sudden change.

Although the University needed to replace Mello eventually, it certainly did not need to replace him immediately. The University could have waited until the end of the Spring semester. The new director will most likely want to make changes in staff, policies and strategies. Making the same changes at the end of the year and implementing them during the summer would have made them less intrusive and more effective.

Subheadline: Team still winless after seven overtimes
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
DENTON, Tex.- FIU's (0-6, 0-3) hopes of snapping a five-game losing streak came to an end Oct. 7 as North Texas (2-4, 1-1) place kicker Denis Hopovac connected from 34 yards out in front of 15,123 fans in the seventh overtime to give the hosts a 25-22 victory at Fouts Field.

"It's disappointing, there is no question," said coach Don Strock. "We had opportunities to win it and we didn't. I'm disappointed [for the players] because they played very hard and they left it all out there."

On the previous Golden Panther possession, freshman place kicker Dustin Rivest, who ended the night three-of-seven kicking, missed from 35 yards away setting up the final Mean Green possession. 

"My heart was beating," said defensive back Robert Mitchell. "It hurt when he made it. It's a tough loss." 

The Golden Panthers were without starting running back A'mod Ned, sidelined through injury. Fellow sophomore Julian Reams picked up the slack rushing 27 times for 100 yards.

Senior quarterback Josh Padrick completed 29-of-43 passes on the night for 248 yards and a touchdown, finding freshman Ashlyn Parker and senior Chandler Williams eight times each for 71 and 58 yards, respectively. His lone touchdown came in the third quarter, finding tight end Andy Anderson from 21 yards out which gave FIU a 6-5 lead.

The Golden Panther defense was once again in full force led by senior defensive end Antwan Barnes who notched eight tackles, a sack and returned an interception 21 yards for a touchdown with 51 seconds to play in the third quarter. Linebacker Wendy Napoleon and defensive back Chris Smith led all tacklers with 16 and 14 tackles, respectively.

NT was led by backup quarterback Daniel Meager in the third quarter with his team down 13-5. He finished the night eight-of-16 for just 86 yards and a crucial touchdown and two-point conversion that gave the hosts a 16-13 lead with just two minutes to play in regulation. 

Running back Jamario Thomas led the way on the ground, carrying 38 times for 148 yards while wide receiver Johnny Quinn managed 10 catches for 88 yards and a touchdown.

Kicker Hopovac finished the day five-of-nine kicking, including three makes in the extra sessions.

After having to punt on the opening drive, everything seemed to be going FIU's way as North Texas took a gamble running a flee flicker as their first play. Starting quarterback Woody Wilson threw down field and was intercepted by FIU's Robert Mitchell. The Golden Panthers struggled with a three and out. On the ensuing punt, the snap sailed over the head of freshman punter Chris Cook, rolled through the end zone and gave NT a 2-0 lead.

Following the safety punt, NT took over the football at their 48-yard line. Their 13-play drive culminated in a 35-yard field goal by Hopovac; NT led 5-0.

FIU's last possession of the first half began with 2:46 remaining as FIU quickly moved the ball down field, with Padrick completing the 700 pass of his career, a 22-yard completion to Williams, only to feel NT push back once inside the red zone. 

Following two incomplete passes, Padrick found Williams for a gain of nine setting up a fourth-and-goal with 14 seconds to play. Strock's men had plenty of time to think about their play as they used up their last timeout, only to come out of it handing the ball to Reams who couldn't find his way into the end zone, ending the half with NT leading 5-0. 

FIU's opening drive of the second half looked as if a new team had stepped onto the field.

Padrick led the visitors down field on a seven play, 80-yard drive that culminated in Padrick finding Anderson for a 21-yard touchdown. Rivest's extra point was blocked, marking the fourth missed PAT by a Golden Panther this season and giving FIU a 6-5 lead. 

The FIU defense then buckled down and forced Wilson to throw into the waiting hands of Barnes who returned the interception 21 yards for his second career interception leading to a touchdown, giving FIU a 13-5 lead.

NT would cut the lead to five, 13-8 as Hopovac connected on his second field goal, this time from 23 yards with just 5:12 left in regulation.

On the ensuing drive, the Golden Panthers were unable to take more than 1:36 off the clock in protecting their lead and were forced to punt following a three-and-out.

With 3:36 to play, NT began their drive in fantastic field position at the FIU 46-yard line.

It took Meager just five plays to get the hosts into the end zone and a sixth to convert a two-point conversion, which made the difference, three in favor of NT. Meager first found Zach Muzzy for a 40-yard completion on the first play of the drive and Quinn for a 4-yard touchdown pass. He kept the ball right up the middle for a two-point conversion. 

With 1:36 to play, FIU  trailed with the chance to win on the final drive. The Golden Panthers started the drive from the  50-yard line. Padrick was able to engineer his way to the NT 11-yard line. From there, with two seconds to play, Rivest connected on a 28-yard field goal to send the game into overtime.

In overtime, FIU's best chance of the night came as Padrick found freshman receiver Jeremy Dickens, who broke across the field and dove near the NT sideline, hitting the pile-on. The Golden Panthers celebrated only to have the play challenged and overturned in the booth. From there, FIU was unable to get into the end zone and had to settle for a field goal from 19 yards. 

"I thought I was in," Dickens said. "The ruling on the field stands and whatever the ref calls is what you have to play with and we just have to live with it. We should have gotten in the end zone to make up for it at the end."

The Golden Panthers  face a tough test Oct. 14 at the Orange Bowl aginst the University of Miami.

Headline: Men's soccer fails to earn first conference victory
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Light rain helped a late shot slip through the hands of senior goalkeeper Shawn Crowe, and with it slid FIU's attempt to earn its first win in Conference-USA play this season.

In its first road game after an eight-match home stand, FIU (4-6-2, 0-3-0) dropped its third consecutive conference game, losing 1-0 to No. 9 South Carolina. Freshman midfielder Jeff Scannella's goal in the 79th minute gave the Gamecocks (10-2-0, 3-1-0) a victory in the Oct. 7 match and left the Golden Panthers shut-out for the fifth time this season.

Scannella scored the game-winner on a blistering shot from 12 yards out. He controlled a long cross that midfielder David Smith sent into the penalty area, and then blasted the ball towards the net. Crowe dove to make a save, but Scannella's fast-moving shot slid off the goalkeeper's hands and into the right side of the goal.

"It was just one of those things you can't control," head coach Karl Kremser said. "The backline played well the whole game and on that play I thought Shawn had it, but then I saw the ball go into the net, which is really unfortunate."

Until Scannella scored, the match was evenly contested. FIU started both halves defending against South Carolina's aggressive offense, and then counterattacked frequently. The Golden Panthers took 11 shots and six corner kicks to the Gamecocks's 12 and four.

FIU pushed to answer to South Carolina's goal, but goalkeeper Mike Gustavson denied several potential equalizers. He smothered a shot from sophomore forward Levi Coleman in the 81st minute, and made a game-saving stop five minutes later. Junior defender Raoul Voss nearly knocked in a corner kick cross from Edgard Correa, but Gustavson saved the header from six yards out.

"I thought it was pretty disappointing," said Kremser. "We played really well and just couldn't score. Edgard had a couple of opportunities, Christian [Caporaletti] took a shot that almost got in - we created some great chances."

FIU nearly scored in the 64th minute when sophomore midfielder Dadi Kristj&aacute;nsson got open in front of the goal. Kristj&aacute;nsson pounced on a ball played in by senior forward David Hope, but his shot sailed over the crossbar.

The Golden Panthers also had a chance to score in the closing moments of the first half. A corner kick from Kristj&aacute;nsson bounced to Coleman, but Gustavson swooped in to take the ball before he could shoot. 

In all, Gustavson made six saves to preserve the win, which is South Carolina's seventh-consecutive against FIU. The Golden Panthers have only one tie in the eight-game series against the Gamecocks.

Kremser said that despite the loss, players displayed positive traits. FIU has been competitive against top teams in C-USA and is starting to find its form.

"We had a letdown the game before last but we really got it together against a tough team," he said. "You have to remember that we're a rebuilt team and still trying to get where we need to be.

"We recruited hard workers and built this team to reflect that, and our guys are definitely giving the effort that [coaches] expect of them."

FIU now turns its attention to Marshall (3-6-1, 0-2-0), which hosts the Golden Panthers in a critical C-USA showdown Oct. 11.

The Thundering Herd is also winless in conference play after losing back-to-back games to Alabama-Birmingham and Tulsa.

The match loser will fall to last place in C-USA, so FIU is focused on victory.

"It's a must win game. We need wins to stay in this race and we have to come away with one in that game," Kremser said.

Headline: Volleyball off to 8-0 start in Sun Belt play
Author: Renaldo Smith / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With outside power hitter Yarimar Rosa sidelined with an injured knee, the women's volleyball team knew that it needed everyone to step up in order to keep their undefeated record intact.

The budding team did just that as junior setter Keila Oliveira and freshman hard hitters Olga Vergun and Arasay Guerra led the way in a 3-0 (30-28, 30-20, 30-24) win over North Texas on Oct. 6 and a 3-1 (30-16, 30-22, 28-30, 30-23) victory over Denver on Oct. 8 at the Pharmed Arena.

Guerra, who posted double-digit kills in both contests expressed her confidence in her team.

"It feels really good to keep winning and with every win we are doing great. We are a really confident team right now and I think we are doing well. We always work hard and we are prepared to play against anybody and it doesn't matter who it is," Guerra said.



FIU 3, NT 0



The Golden Panthers wasted little time asserting their dominance against North Texas as Vergun opened the game with two consecutive kills to push FIU in front. 

Vergun led FIU with her second double-double of the year, recording 19 kills and 10 digs. Oliveria added a double-double of her own as she had a strong 41 assists, 10 digs and five kills while Guerra took over in the final set finished with 12 kills.

After dropping the first game, North Texas played a sloppy second set where they never led. In the final game they managed to jump out to a 15-13 lead, but the Golden Panthers rode the back of a fired up Guerra and wrapped up the win. Tara Hooser and Katy Prokof led North Texas with 10 kills each. Brooke Engel chipped in with six kills and Jessica Hulsebosch collected a match high 20 digs in the loss.



FIU 3, DENVER 1



The Golden Panthers came together for another strong performance against Denver. After dropping the opening point of the match, the Golden Panthers never trailed in the opening game and were just as dominant in the second. After stealing the third set, it appeared as though the Pioneers were poised to force a deciding fifth set as they jumped out to a 9-3 lead. 

However, it wasn't meant to be as the Golden Panthers responded with a 6-0 run to level the score before taking the lead at 13-12 en route to the four set win.

Oliveria, who finished the game just one kill short of a triple-double, masterfully orchestrated the offense in her 52-assist, 10-digs and nine-kill performance. Vergun tied her career high 26 kills at a .365 clip with ten digs and a match-high five aces. 

According to head coach Danijela Tomic, the team will take it one game at a time as they look to continue stacking up wins.

"The whole philosophy is that we are not looking at records," Tomic said. "We take one game at a time and we go into every match thinking it is the most important match of the season. So far it has been successful and I am just happy for this group of kids." 

FIU (15-4) will put their school-record, nine consecutive wins and Sun Belt-leading 8-0 mark on the line on the road Oct. 16 and Oct. 18 against Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee, respectively.

Headline: Offensive line coach talks about playing for UM, coaching for FIU
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Heading to this weekend's first game against the University of Miami, The Beacon sat down with FIU offensive line coach and former UM offensive lineman Leon Searcy.

Searcy was a five-year letter winner between 1987 and 1991, winning three National Championships under the leadership of Jimmy Johnson and Denis Erickson, earning All-American standing his senior year. He was the 11 pick in the 1992 draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Searcy retired in 2002 following an injury he sustained while at the Miami Dolphins' training camp. 

He is now in his third season as the Golden Panthers' offensive line coach. 

Q: What did you learn from the coaches at Miami? How do you apply that to what you are doing day in and day out at FIU?

To love the game. You love the game on Saturday through preparing throughout the week. You do everything you can between Monday and Friday in the film room, in the weight room, in classroom, out on the field in preparation so when [Oct. 14] comes it's supposed to be fun. That is what I learned at the [UM], come [Oct. 14] it was time to party... I was privileged to be coached under three pretty good offensive line coaches, starting with Tony Weiss, who is now with the New York Jets. Then it was Art Kehoe, who is now with Ole Miss, and then Greg Smith who has been in the [NFL] for a couple of years and is now coaching at Idaho. I was privileged to be coached under those guys and they groomed me into the player that I was. 

Q: Do your players ever ask about your days at Miami?

All the time and they don't believe half the stuff I tell them. That is the misconception with [UM]. I try and tell the guys over here that we don't work hard enough with all these NCAA rules and stuff, these one and a half hour practices, over there at Miami we worked. 

A lot of the perception over here is that 'oh coach you didn't have to do this and that,' it's contrary to belief … Over there it was a full time job. Those guys were committed to winning and that is why we had so much success. 

Q: What are your feelings heading into the game this weekend at the Orange Bowl against your alma mater?

I want to win. I bleed orange and green, don't get me wrong, I love everything about them. They have attributed to the mass majority of my success in college and professional ranks, but my check says FIU, so as much as I like that program over there … I am here at FIU and I want these guys to win. I want them to experience that if it's all possible. We are preparing to win. 

Q: What do you think your feelings are going to be coming out of that tunnel?

It's going to feel different getting booed. It's going to be different not coming out of the smoke and the visitors locker room. I have never experienced that before. 

Q: What are the biggest differences you see between this program and UM's, excluding the fact that FIU has been around for only five years?

That is the key, the difference is that [UM] has a rich tradition; a bunch of draft picks and they are committed to the program. Here, we're new, we're young. 

I tell these guys all the time, Miami didn't become the U overnight; they had to grow. There was a time in the late 1970s where they were thinking about getting rid of the program. They started committing themselves to athletics and the football program took off. 

With the pool of talent that you have here in South Florida, FIU could be the next Miami easily with the right commitment, the right recruits, the new facilities, new stadium. Give these future players some eye candy. We have this new stadium that is going to be built so this program has as much potential to be the next Miami as any other program. 

Q: What are your thoughts on Pete Garcia as the new Athletic Director at FIU?

Pete's track record speaks for itself. He is responsible for probably the greatest exodus of pro athletes ever. In his regime with Butch [Davis], he was responsible for bringing in guys like Ed Reed, Clinton Portis, Jeremy Shockey, Bryant McKinnie and all these guys were first round draft picks. In a span of four to five years, they had 16 first-round draft picks. The guy knows what he is doing. As far as football operations go, [Garcia] is A+ [and] you can't deny that. I'm pretty sure that he is being brought over here to bring that same kind of experience to FIU. 

Q: What was your most memorable moment at UM? At FIU?

The ticker tapes. The parades. Being adored in a convertible with confetti falling down on you. I had the opportunity, and I tell the kids here, [to experience] three of them. It is the greatest feeling knowing that you're a champion, knowing that you're number one and that the people around you care. 

[At FIU], probably last year when we beat FAU. [It] was nice to see them come out and win the way they did. I was real excited because our kids had been real frustrated that they couldn't beat FAU for a long time. When they got the victory I was very happy for them.

Q: Coaching trends dictate that coaches normally don't stay at the same school forever. Do you see yourself coaching at UM?

I would love to. If the opportunity presented itself I would have to throw my hat in the ring. I think I am qualified and if I get the opportunity, God-willing, that would be an opportunity I would look at.

Headline: Father and son will watch game from opposing sides
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Growing up, FIU sophomore center Xavier Shannon always heard his father Randy Shannon, defensive coordinator for the University of Miami, yell at him to stop climbing a tree in his yard.

Being a stubborn child at the time, he continued to climb the tree until he fell and cut his leg, leaving a scar that he has until this day. Known for his tough love on his players, Randy didn't make any exceptions for his son that day and didn't even make a big deal about the cut when his son returned from the hospital.

Randy doesn't expect things to change as his defense prepares to take on FIU Oct. 14.

"No matter who it is, if it's brother lining up across against you, your grandmother, your mom, you got to win," Randy said. "You can't feel bad about it. That's how it is, that's my son, but you know what, we have to find a way to win. Them guys have to do what they got to do to beat his butt."

And Xavier said he is ready to take on one of the best defenses in the nation and isn't holding anything back. He would love for FIU's first win to come against UM and thinks a win will put a stamp on this season.

"[My father] always told me growing up that everyone's the same. Everyone wears a mouthpiece, everyone puts on a helmet, everyone has hit pads," Xavier said. "It doesn't bother me that they're probably bigger than us and probably faster than us. You just got to go out there and play hard and whoever has the most heart will win the game."

Just like his father, he has a tremendous amount of confidence in his own ability and in his team.

"We're the only team in the city, because the last time I checked, the University of Miami is in Coral Gables and FIU is in Miami," he said. "So this is our city; they have to take it from us. It's a home game for us."

Xavier knows how good and fast most of those guys in Coral Gables are because he's always down at their athletic facility with his father.

Every Sunday since his freshman year, he brings some food from his great-grandmother's house for his father and the two hang out for an hour or two, talking about football and life. 

But the dinner on Oct.  8 wasn't the same.

When dropping off some roast beef, macaroni and cheese and green beans, his father was breaking down film from FIU's sextuple overtime loss to North Texas, game planning for the game against him.

"When I first walked into the football complex, I bumped into some of their players and they were like, 'What are you doing here?' and I was like, 'Every Sunday, I come here.'"

While inside his father's office, Xavier wasn't sure if he should "walk out or stay."

Often times, the two discuss football and technique. But the only advice that Xavier received from his father that day was to "play hard."

Despite being named a 2003 third-team all-state performer, Randy never recruited his son, preferring that he play somewhere else. He figured  that would his son to grow into a man.

"I don't believe in getting a son on your team, if not he won't develop as a kid. If I'm here and he's here, he won't ever grow up," Randy said. "Go anywhere you want to grow, but I told him you'll never go anywhere where I'm coaching."

Xavier knows his father will have more fans on his side during the game. During class this week, one of his classmates was wearing a UM shirt and all he said to him was 'nice shirt.' He even admitted to owning his own UM paraphernalia and even wore some orange UM shorts to a workout session during the summer. But the only fans that matter to Xavier are his family, which he says will be pulling for him during the game.

"Before the season, I wanted Miami to go 11-1 and their one loss came against FIU. But it didn't turn out that way so hopefully they'll finish 9-3."

"The whole family is rooting for me, from the youngest to the oldest."

Growing up, Xavier rooted for UM since his father played there and coached there when he was younger. He even got to watch UM win the National Championship in 2001.

Despite family members and friends taking sides during the game, both are approaching the game with a business-like attitude.

"We'll hug before the game and after the game we'll joke and have a good time. But from the beginning whistle to the end whistle, it's just business," Xavier said. "He has to do a job and I have to do a job. If he doesn't do his job, he'll be removed and if I don't do my job, I'll be removed."

Headline: What else is there to say about 0-6?
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It took four hours and 15 minutes, including seven overtimes, for the football team to remain without a win.

And what it all came down to was the biggest thorn on this team's side this season - a missed extra point.

Well, not exactly.

But it feels like week in and week out, I'm writing the same thing about this team. There's seriously nothing new or insightful to say. After all, when a team is 0-6, it's hard to find excuses every week. How many different ways can you talk about lapses in special teams, or any other part of the team for that matter?

By now it should be clear what this team's problems are and by now it should also be clear that it's too late to correct them - especially with the University of Miami on the slate Oct. 14.

The biggest concern for FIU against UM should be who will be rooting for them. It is no secret that many FIU students are UM fans. Hell, I used to be a Hurricane season ticket holder. But I think it's going to be pretty ridiculous to have FIU students wearing UM gear in the FIU student section.

Now, I'm in no way saying you should be all rah rah for your Alma matter. After all, the FIU football team hasn't given its fans anything to cheer about so far.

But let's look at the situation from an outsider's (or someone not from Miami) perspective. If they were to come to a game between supposed cross-town rivals, the last thing they'll expect to see is the opposing team's student section having spots of the home team's colors.

Duke University and the University of North Carolina literally lie on the same street about a mile away from each other. Never in a million years would you see a Duke student walk around campus with a UNC shirt or vise versa. And if you do, you've met a student with a death wish.

This type of blasphemy happens on this campus everywhere and not just with UM shirts. People also wear sport gear from Florida State and the University of Florida. I've even seen a couple of people sport Dartmouth shirts (seriously, what the hell?).

There's no point in talking about the lack of school pride at FIU, because it's something that's gone on for years, but I know why there are a good number of students who are UM fans.

Miami is and will probably always be a football town. It's been that way since the Miami Dolphins came to town and became the first NFL team to win back-to-back Super Bowls, including the perfect 1972 season.

Then in the '80s, the Dolphins weren't as strong and in came the Hurricanes, winning titles in 1983, 1987 and 1989. Winners sell and, despite the school's small student body, the team developed a huge following during that time and it has grown today, whether it be through family, friends or the fact that it's easy to root for a five-time national championship winner.

It became so easy to root for a winner that a 9-3 record at UM is considered a disappointing season. I bet some people in the FIU Athletics Department would kill for a "disappointment" like that.

Right now, this game has the most amount of uncertainty surrounding it considering UM's struggles this year. It could be a blow out, it could be a close game or a bunch of baby seagulls can land on the field. It's really all up in the air.

The only certain things in this match up are that UM is Goliath and FIU is David. Now, in the Bible, the outcome of that battle came as a surprise. But nine times out of 10 Goliath wins. Now we'll just have to wait and see which of the 10 times this game will be.
