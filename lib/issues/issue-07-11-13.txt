Headline: Eateries offer college discounts:  Vendors near campus provide
Author: Douglas Forte / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When it comes to selecting an inexpensive place to eat off campus, students at the Biscayne Bay Campus have a variety of locations to choose from in the North Miami area.

Local vendors have been cooperating with BBC since the beginning of the semester by having coupon giveaways on campus and providing student discounts. 

"I went around to see if any local vendors were offering discounts," said Jason Ingrao, a Campus Life graduate assistant, who intiated a search for eateries that offer marked-down foods to help housing students.

"Some already had promotional discounts, and others were willing to cooperate for promotional purposes," Ingrao said. 

These vendors also offer certain discounts which have a longtime frame, while some are temporary."

One vendor that provides student discounts is Cold Stone Creamery on 148th Street and Biscayne Boulevard in North Miami.

"We basically reach out to local shopping areas and schools," said Eladio Hernandez, the store's owner. 

A 10 percent discount is offered to students who present their FIU PantherCard. 

They also accept store coupons for $1 off of "love it" (medium) and "gotta have it" (large) sized menu ice creams and customer creations. The coupons are given out at University events such as BBC's Welcome Week.

Domino's Pizza has also contacted FIU for promotional reasons. 

On Wednesdays at the 16th Avenue and 164th Street location in North Miami Beach, students with a valid FIU PantherCard can receive a large one-topping pizza for $8.99. 

"Students haven't really taken advantage as yet, because we just started this deal in the fall, but there is an e-mail system being set up to notify students," said Jake Levy, store manager. "There are already ads in the directory as well." 

Jamba Juice, on 135th Street and Biscayne Boulevard, is also cooperating alongside FIU with promotional giveaways and in-store events planned for the future. 

"Students with $25 on their Jamba Card can get a free 16-ounce smoothie," said Vanessa Rodriguez, the store manager. "We also offer free sampling on campus."

During Welcome Week at the beginning of the Fall semester, Jamba Juice gave away 500 free 16-ounce smoothie coupons. 

They will be giving away more free smoothie coupons at Snack Attack, a premidnight breakfast, on Dec. 10, according to Ingrao. 

In Jamba Juice's case, Ingrao beat Rodriguez to the chase - she wanted to contact the school but didn't know how to go about it.

"He made the call first," Rodriguez said. "I was always interested in cooperating, but he made [the partnership] happen. 

The students haven't flocked to us as yet, but there has been a steady influx of free smoothie coupons." 

Ingrao also said Ben and Jerry's, also on 135th Street and Biscayne Boulevard in North Miami, currently offers a 10 percent discount on regular ice cream cups when an FIU event store coupon is presented. 

"It's all situational, some do and some do not cooperate, but it is mainly to show students what's available in the area," Ingrao said.

Headline: LOVE VS FAITH: Students face challenges in inter-faith relationships
Author: Olivia Sarracino / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Abraham Joshua Heschel, a Jewish theologian, once said, "The problem to be faced is: how to combine loyalty to one's own tradition with reverence for different traditions." 

It is a problem that is still being faced today by couples of different religious beliefs. A 2005 study published in College Student Journal by Dr. Michael D. Reiter, Jaimie M. Krause and Amber Stirlen about college intercouple relationships - those that are inter-faith, intercultural and interracial - concluded that about 12 percent of college students are in interfaith relationships.

"Religion plays a big role in relationships," said Janice Spann-Givens, associate director at the Multicultural Programs and Services at Biscayne Bay Campus. "Not only male and female, but also with friends because a lot of times you tend to gravitate to those people that have your same religious beliefs." 

According to Gregory Pope, a professor of religious studies, the questions that religion seeks to answer could lead to potential conflict in inter-faith relationships.

"Religion seeks to answer three things: the intent of God, the meaning of this world and the purpose of man," said Pope. "With those three things, I think that it causes one to view their world from that particular perspective, and if you have a world view on a particular religion, and another person has an entirely different world view, it can create some friction."

         To Joy Deitrich, an international business student, this is a problem that she has had to face throughout her five year relationship. 

"Our perspectives are different, so it does clash," she said. "But, it depends on who you are, you need to understand that they have another religion, or else you are going to keep fighting." 

 Like Deitrich, Don Mohan, a marketing student, is also trying to cope with an inter-faith relationship. His two year relationship has had its ups and downs, and not necessarily because of a religious difference, but because as he said, "I am Christian, but not to the extent she would like me to be."

For both Deitrich and Mohan, religion plays an important part on their relationship, but it's an issue that they have learned to understand and accept. 

"She is really close to her father, so she doesn't like to disappoint him," says Mohan. "It's not that she is so much into it, but it's because that is what is expected of her, so I try to understand and listen to her."

 This understanding and respect for another person's religion is one of the fundamentals to a healthy interfaith relationship, according to Pope. 

 "Underneath all, there is a human being and that human being must be respected," said Pope. "We must listen to other stories and understand that, first of all, our story may not be absolute. That there are others, who are trying to express the meaning of this world, and by listening to their stories, we can better understand their world view and they can better understand our world view."  

There are other options for understanding different religions such as visiting your partner's or your friend's place of worship. Spann-Givens suggests this as a way of learning about other religions; she, as a college student and a sorority member at University of Florida, was asked to attend each of her sorority sisters' church to better understand one other.

  Next semester, MPAS will provide a workshop entitled "Religious Pride and Prejudice" on March 27, 2008 that will address issues related to interfaith relationships.

 "This is an opportunity to discuss religion and what roles it plays with students here on campus," said Spann-Givens. "And even to dialogue about some of the prejudices that come into the university setting having about religions that are not you own."

  For more information on the Spring workshop, students can call the BBC's MPAS office at 305-919-5817 or the University Park office at 305-348-2436.

Headline: Don't BEE in the Dark: B-Hive Project aims to spread knowledge about HIV-AIDS
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Since the introduction of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the United States, advances in medicine have been utilized to keep patients with the disease alive longer, but its cure has not been discovered. That is why Tamara and Matt Parisi feel that students and the community need to be HIV educated. 

"We do both Dance Marathon and Relay for Life every year but I felt there was a need for [an HIV philanthropy], considering we are one of the highest states infected by HIV," Tamara said.

When the project began in Summer 2005, "Be HIV Educated," or the B-HIVE project, donated $3,000 to the Children's Home Society, an organization that provides resources for children with behavioral and emotional problems. In 2006, the project surpassed itself by donating $4,000 to the Center for Positive Connections, a local non-profit organization that works with those infected and affected by HIV and AIDS. This year, the committee behind B-HIVE chose the same center as its charity for the event. The center was chosen by the Parisis because they felt donations would make a greater impact on a small local group that is not accustomed to receiving large donations as opposed to a well-known organization where a donation could get lost in the shuffle. 

The event will consit of various lectures, activities and skits to help inform the students about HIV and dispel any myths students might have about it, including the transmission of the virus. 

"Every day, we wake up and forget how fortunate we are and how amazing we are and we don't necessarily say 'thank you,'" Tamara said about her experience since starting B-HIVE.

The annual B-HIVE project will occur Nov. 28 at 7 p.m. in the first floor lounge of the Everglades Hall. The event is free and open to all students.

Free HIV exams will also be provided at the event and there will be a banner contest for all clubs and organizations which will be judged at the event. The winner will be given 10 percent of the fundraising they make to be given to the philanthropy of choice. All the entries must be delivered to Everglades Hall by Nov. 28 by 6 p.m.

B-HIVE meetings are held every Monday at 9 p.m. in the Lakeview North conference room and are open to any students interested in coordinating the event. Even though Tamara graduated this past Spring, she still helps the committee by helping it brainstorm and keeping an open communication by attending meetings. Tamara hopes for B-HIVE to get bigger each year, up to the point where housing can no longer be its venue. The next ideal option would be the FIU Stadium. The group plans on expanding each year and hopes to become a key event at FIU and expand to other areas in Miami-Dade County. 

Rachel Olmedo, a junior who has been actively helping the committee since 2006, feels her goal is to have students reconsider the choices they make when it comes to their sexual options. 

"If we just get one more person to rethink and to be more cautious in the decisions they make about their own sexual safety, then I think [our] goal is reached," Olmedo said.

Headline: Racing game easy on eyes, wallets
Author: Ashlyn Toledo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you're itching for a new title but can't bring yourself to shell out the 60 bucks for a next-generation title, free online games are the solution. Sites are pilling up all over the Internet with all sorts of games. Each week I'll review a new, completely free online game that anyone with access to a computer can enjoy. 

KartRider, a game from Nexon, creators of games like Maplestory and GunBound, is a free, online cart racing game inspired by the Mario Kart series. Kart Rider is a game that has seen incredible success in South Korea where it was first released, and was recently brought to the U.S.

The game offers two modes of play. You can opt for a single player story mode or race against other players throughout the U.S. and Canada. Story mode takes you through the career of Dao, a young racer with high hopes and lots of talent. You complete missions to practice new skills, show off the ones you already mastered and earn respect points and "Lucci", the currency used in the game. Respect points allow access to new levels in story mode and rank you by skill level. Lucci can be used at the shop to customize your cart, purchase new carts and new characters.

The multiplayer game offers a lot of choices. You can join a room that's already set up or create your own room with your own racing preferences. You can also choose between single or team races, and Item or speed modes. Item mode is more similar to MarioKart. Players race around the track picking up items that can be used strategically to help you finish first. Banana peels, speed bursts and missiles may bring you back to a time of turtle shells and mushrooms. 

Speed mode is where you use your drifting ability to fill an NO2 gauge for a burst of speed; and there's no need to worry about playing against people who are way ahead in skill. The races are ranked by skill level and Nexon uses the point system to award players significantly less for winning against a less skilled driver to discourage the more experienced players from crashing the rookie races. 

On the downside, most of your shop purchases can only be used for a limited time before they expire but you probably won't have any trouble earning enough Lucci to re-buy your favorites. And for Mac Users there is even worse news, KartRider is only compatible with Windows, so unless your fortunate enough to have dual-booting, KartRider will elude you for some time. 

KartRider looks and feels great. The cute, cell-shaded graphics lend themselves well to the title and the arrow pad controls are easy to pick up. Fans of the genre or anyone looking for a nice change of pace are sure to be pleased with KartRider. You can download KartRider and set up your Nexon account for free at www.KartRider.com.

Headline: Review: Front Mission
Subheadline: Remake of Super Nintendo strategy title an exciting throwback to '90s
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Square-Enix's Front Mission series, while not very prominent in the U.S., has garnered a following with the third and fourth installments on PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2.  Now almost 10 years after the release of the original Front Mission on the Super Nintendo in Japan, fans and strategy buffs alike can now experience the roots of the series on Nintendo's handheld system.

The focus of Front Mission has always been about the struggles and casualties of war on all sides in a futuristic Earth that's not too different from our own; the game focuses on Huffman Island, now divided among the super nations of the O.C.U. (Oceanic Community Union, consisting of Australia, Japan and mainland Southeast Asia) and U.C.S. (Unified Continental States, comprising of the Americas)  as they battle for supremacy.  Royd Clive, a former soldier turned mercenary-for-hire, is soon brought back to military service under the flag of the O.C.U. and soon discovers the true reason behind the Second Huffman War.

Front Mission's wars have evolved to the use of giant mechs, called wanzers  and are the crux of the gameplay.  As players move across the island, cities become hubs for information gathering, story progression and shopping for wanzer parts and weapons,  ranging from different arm and leg types that affect parameters such as defense and movement to weapons that include machine guns and missiles.  Customizing your war machines is paramount to success on the battlefield and will take up most of your game time; players with a love for tweaking every detail will be in for a treat.  

Conflict moves in turn-based fashion on a grid-style map with enemies ranging from enemy wanzers, tanks and other war machines.  Terrain and elevation also play a big part in combat.  

Pilots joining your cause can specialize in short or long range combat and can also learn skills to bolster their performance as they level up.  

The main campaign is fairly long and difficult - players must strategize their moves carefully and have their wanzers in top fighting condition.  Also available is the U.C.S. campaign focusing on officer Kevin Greenfield added from the PS1 remake in Japan to help tie loose ends in the initial story, adding more replay value.

Considering it's a remake of a SNES game, the graphics are fairly utilitarian and get the job done.  The battle maps are drawn nicely and the close ups of the wanzers engaging add more to the overall presentation.  The music and sounds of Front Mission, as basic as the visuals, work well with the game's grim war-like atmosphere.

In conclusion, Front Mission is an excellent choice for strategy enthusiasts and current fans can now see how this great series began.  

The only sad part is that we may not see more of it, and we can only hope Square-Enix takes notice and decide to tell us more of this world at war.

Headline: Review: Castlevania: Dracula X Chronicles
Subheadline: Castlevania fans will find a lot to love in new compilation for Sony's PSP
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Castlevania series has enthralled gamers with its dark atmosphere and harrowing challenge. Now, for the franchise's 20th anniversary, two classic tales of the night are packaged together at last in Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles for Sony's Playstation Portable.

The main highlight of the Dracula X Chronicles is the long-awaited release of Castlevania: Rondo of Blood outside of Japan. Regarded as one of the highlights of the series, Rondo of Blood has been given a 3D makeover while retaining the classic 2D gameplay.  The second gem in the collection is the sequel, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night serves as an important bridging point in Castlevania's history by shifting focus from the straightforward action of old to exploring and role playing elements that define the more recent iterations. It also makes the jump from the 8-bit and 16-bit roots of the game to the PlayStation 1.

Rondo of Blood continues the Belmont clan's never-ending feud with Dracula, as Richter Belmont fights to save his beloved from the newly resurrected Count. Rondo plays as older Castlevania titles did: Richter walks, jumps, cracks the whip and uses special weapons to navigate 7 stages.  Multiple paths can be found leading to new stages and enemies, and the paths can also affect the game's conclusion.  Fans who are new to the series may be shocked to experience Richter's slow movement, limited abilities and the game's harsh difficulty, but those who remember the good old days  will find plenty to love.  As an extra treat for purists, the original version of Rondo of Blood is a hidden gem.  

Symphony of the Night continues right where Rondo of Blood leaves off.  This time, the son of Dracula, Alucard, who has sided with the Belmonts before.

Alucard heads for his father's castle to find Richter and confront Dracula.  Much akin to Nintendo's Metroid franchise, Alucard can find and equip multiple weapons, armor and learn new abilities to explore the various locations of Dracula's stronghold.  Players of the original game and newer Castlevania games will feel right at home with this one.  Other than the new voicework recorded for the dialogue, Symphony has been reproduced to near perfection.

The original titles in the collection have shown their age visually, but still hold up.  Rondo's amazing musical score is redone for the new release (the original score is also in the game), and Symphony of the Night still remains one of Michiru Yamane's best works in the series' history.  From fast jams, slow melodies and remixes of classic Castlevania tunes, all the music delivers its magic in spades.

With the renewal of a lost gem and the return of an old favorite, Castlevania fans, old and new, have waited for a compilation this great. Konami has crafted it with the mastery both titles deserve.

Headline: PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION: Unpaid tickets sent to collection agencies
Subheadline: Department cracks down on traffic, parking offenders
Author: Luis Valdez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Students with unpaid parking tickets beware; the University is starting to turn over unpaid tickets to collection agencies, possibly hurting a student's credit history.

According to the FIU Department and Transportation Web site, anyone issued a citation or ticket has 10 business days to pay the fine or file an appeal. If the allotted time expires without the fine being paid or appealed, an additional late fee will be issued. 

"It affects your credit ratings. For a college student, that's huge," said Bill Buchanan, the University Park Student Government Council director of internal affairs. "A lot of us have loans we need to pay off and it will kill your interest rates and hurt your ability to buy a car or a house in the future." 

One common complaint students are raising is that they are not being reminded that they have unpaid tickets. Also, students are not being notified when their tickets are being sent to collection agencies.

"A lot of students have come up to our office to tell us that they have been sent to collection [agencies] and they don't know why until they called back and were told they had FIU parking tickets," Buchanan said. "Most of these students would have paid the tickets if they were notified ahead of time, but instead they were just called by an agency. I'm not saying that FIU is not sending notices, I'm saying that a lot of people are not getting them." 

However, Director of Parking and Transportation Bill Foster, said that students are regularly notified about their citations. 

"Parking and Transportation will send a 30-day late letter, a 60-day late letter and a 90-day late letter. Most of the time, it is sent via e-mail to the registered e-mail address provided when they got their decal," Foster said.

According to Marbely Hernandez, president of SGC-UP, there was no indication in her "MyFIU" account saying she had unpaid parking ticket holds. She received a ticket in January and on Nov. 5 she received a call from a collection agency.

"From the policy that I knew and from what's in the student handbook you would get a hold. I find it interesting because I did not have a hold and I was able to sign up for my Fall semester classes so I did not think that I owed anything. Now I am getting calls from collection agencies for a ticket from January," Hernandez said. 

According to Foster, student records are not sent to a collection agency until the citation is 210 days old, because it's already posted to their school accounts. This gives students the current semester and the beginning of the next semester to settle the ticket.

Although a student can be reported to a collection agency, there are no other significant legal actions taken against them. 

"There are no legal problems like insurance issues or driving record concerns since these are University parking tickets," Foster said. 

According to the Office of the Registrar, other than financial repercussions, a student cannot register for classes or request transcripts if they have any financial obligations to the University. In addition a student will not receive a diploma after graduating from the University until they have settled all financial obligations. 

For information on parking tickets or to check if you have any unpaid parking tickets, see the Department of Parking and Transportation Web site at http://parking.fiu.edu/ or go to their offices in the Blue and Gold parking garages.

Headline: Furton made official dean after six years
Author: Jessica Ariste / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Although he admits that the only time he ever got nervous was when he proposed to his wife 18 years ago, Kenneth Furton was relieved to find out that he would be the new dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.

"I was elated when I found out I was going to have this opportunity," Kenneth Furton said.

Furton has been the associate dean of the college since 2001 and will finally take his place as the permanent dean Dec. 20. 

"He's cool, he's nice, [he has] a good sense of humor and has nice ring tones on his phone," Stephanie Torres, senior secretary of the department, said.

The Search and Screen Committee for the dean of the CAS, which is in charge of reviewing applications and interviewing candidates, recommended Furton and Provost Ronald M. Berkman accepted the committee's recommendation. 

"He was the most qualified of all the candidates," said Gisela Casines, associate dean for CAS.

Furton has dedicated his professional life to FIU and, during this time, has held various positions such as graduate program director in the Department of Chemistry and founding director of the International Forensic Research Institute. The IFRI was the first academic forensic center in the state of Florida. He was also the chemistry chairperson from 1997 to 2001.

"To say he is a workaholic is an understatement [but] he is a master at multi-tasking," Casines said.

During his time at FIU, Furton has also written and co-written more than 100 publications, guided the research of more than 100 graduate and undergraduate students and has brought more than $3 million in research support to the school.

His research is focused on forensic science, separation science and, most recently, chemistry. 

"He is very funny, very down to earth and very smart," said Jonell Aarons, a graduate student in his chemistry lab.

Furton has also received various awards including the Boltz Award in Analytical Chemistry in 1986 and the International Association of Forensic Sciences Award in 1996.

The IAFS award was created in 1957 to bring academics and professionals together in the field of forensic science. 

Furton also received the FIU Council of 100 Outstanding University Faculty Award in 2005.

The award is a $10,000 grant awarded yearly to an FIU faculty member who has demonstrated continuous excellence in the three areas that constitute the University's mission; teaching, research and service. 

As associate dean, Furton has done much to improve operations and, by doing so, has helped increase the College's salary savings - the difference between budget and actual expenditures on permanent positions - from approximately $40,000 in 2005 to $400,000 in 2007.

"He is always willing to help," said Jorge Lafarga, Furton's student assistant.

As dean, Furton plans on improving the University Core Curriculum and formatting the necessary classes in a way that all students will benefit from. 

"One of the things that [Furton] says is that he believes in the students and the importance of us making sure that the students get the best educational experience at FIU," Casines said.

He also wants to work on looking at new areas of acquiring funds as a means to attract more students. Furton will also work to get FIU known nationwide and worldwide and expects to do this with selective investment, a commitment to pay attention to programmatic activities. 

"He has already started the job so, even though his official start day is not until Dec. 20, he has already started planning," Casines said. 

Furton is also "looking forward to getting feedback on areas the [CAS] can improve on," from students, faculty and staff, he said.

"I think the provost made a very wise choice in appointing Dean Furton because he is a combination," Casines said. "He has new, different ideas but, at the same time, knows the place."

Headline: Walking on water becomes a reality
Author: Lauren Agosto / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For the past 17 years, architecture students have been defying the laws of physics by walking on water. "Walk on Water" puts students to walk across a 300-foot lake and serves as an assignment for architecture students taking a materials and methods of construction course.

In this design competition, the task is to build floating footgear that enables students to race across the lake in front of the Green Library. This year, the competition will be held Nov. 14 at 11:30 am. The winner will receive $500 from the American Institute of Architects Miami Chapter.

This year, 80 students are participating in the event with 50 of them attempting to walk across the lake. 

Jaime Canav&eacute;s, an associate professor of the School of Architecture, usually coordinates the event for the Fall semester; it was his idea to have architecture students walk on water.

"It is traditional for students in architect design classes [to] have a boat race with canoes made from cardboard. I thought FIU students were special and could do something different," Canav&eacute;s said. "Da Vinci invented shoes to walk on water, so I decided to have my students do it also."

The assignment, which is given to students at the beginning of the semester, is worth 20 percent of their final grade, equivalent to one test grade. Students are allowed to work with a partner and the grade is determined by the distance the student is able to walk. Markers in the water designate the grades. If a student is only able to walk a few feet in the footgear, he or she will receive a "D" for the assignment. 

If a student can cross one-third of the lake, the grade received would be a "C." For crossing two-thirds of the lake, the student will receive a "B." Whoever can make it across the entire lake receives an "A" and the opportunity to drop the lowest exam grade. The fastest record is one minute, twenty-seven seconds and the slowest about thirty minutes.

Usually about 70 percent of students complete the task, Canav&eacute;s said. 

"The students' grades are based on reaching the other side of the lake," Canav&eacute;s said. "The competition is about applying the theories learned in the classroom. It doesn't matter if they land in the water during the process, but they have to reach the opposite shore line."

Melisa Ford, senior, and her brother, Jonathan Wong, have been working on their project since it was first assigned. 

"The project is beneficial to students and their curriculum because it teaches you about how to use certain materials in a situation in order to create a structure to support yourself," Ford said.

Jonathan Thole, junior, is completing the project with his partner, Lauren Sanchez, senior. Thole has been eagerly anticipating this event since the beginning of the semester.

"It is very exciting...You have the opportunity to work with different materials and properties - such as water - and see how they react together," Thole said. 

Many students are concerned about the cleanliness of the water, but Canav&eacute;s assures his students that the lake has been tested for bacteria and that nothing harmful was found in it.

The event will take place at the lake north of the Green Library, between the Viertes Haus and Owa Ehan buildings at University Park.

For more information on the event contact Canav&eacute;s at (305) 348-3031.

Headline: SAVING LIVES: Charities lobby for support not cash
Author:  Jaime Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It is truly inconceivable that in today's world - where technology allows us to connect with people worldwide though the Internet and access bank accounts through iPhones - there are people dying of malaria. This disease can simply be prevented with a $2 mosquito net. Unfortunately, many poverty-ridden families cannot even afford that.

The number of people who die each year in Africa exceeds the population of Maine. According to DATA (Debt AIDS Trade Africa) and The World Bank, in just Africa alone, over 2 million people die from AIDS, 1.5 million children infected by the virus die and another 400,000 die due to malnutrition. 

But among the statistics is good news: we can make a difference. In fact, it has never been easier for students to literally help millions of people.

There is a new global initiative to help end extreme poverty, along with a multitude of ways for us to provide decent living conditions for Africa's underprivileged population. Contrary to the way of monetary donation, some efforts do not require any money whatsoever.

One way for all of us to help is by joining The ONE Campaign (ONE), which was founded by U2 lead singer Bono along with The Bill and the Melinda Gates Foundation. The campaign attempts to mobilize and organize supporters into a large lobbying force to encourage America's elected leaders to do their part in ending extreme poverty.

ONE is easy to join and the difference we can make by uniting our voices to the movement is extraordinary. Already, over two million Americans have joined ONE and helped 36 countries in Africa erase more than $11 billion in debt. As a result, 20 million African children have had a chance at getting a proper education.

For those fashion-inclined people who want to contribute to the cause while simultaneously looking trendy, there is another way to help.

The initiative Product(RED) was created to raise money for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. 

Many popular brands and stores are donating 40 percent of the profits from their branded products to the fund to fight extreme poverty in Africa.

So far, Product(RED) includes merchandise from, Gap, Converse, Motorola, Giorgio Armani, Apple and American Express.

According to the (RED) Web site, www.joinred.com, a $15 purchase can sustain an HIV infected mother and her two children for two full weeks.  

Helping Africa extinguish easily preventable diseases and provide livable conditions is virtually effortless, as some students have already experienced. 

"I didn't even plan to buy this shirt," said senior Jessica Gonzales. "But when I realized that not only was it trendy and cool but I could save lives, it was a no-brainer."

Allowing millions of people to die when the cures are affordable and available is unjustifiable; especially for a society that pays $9 to see a movie when it costs a mere $2 to save lives by preventing malaria and other dangerous diseases.  

Africa can be helped with little effort on our part. Just joining ONE, or buying (RED) products helps children, their parents and friends live a life free of disease and constant poverty.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Deal with Gardasil should be examined closer
Author: Lisa Edmunds / Adjunct English Instructor
&nbsp;
I am more than a little uncomfortable with the promotional materials the FIU bookstore is distributing for Guardasil, the HPV/cervical cancer vaccine available to young women. 

I think it is inappropriate for the Bookstore to be putting my purchases in a bag advertising the vaccine, and when I looked in the bag, I even found promotional materials touting Gardasil. I understand that the vaccine has a valid use in theory; HPV and cervical cancer are great concerns for sexually active young women. What concerns me is that the vaccine is largely untested. 

There have been numerous reports of complications and side effects from this vaccine. By promoting the vaccine, in distributing these advertising materials, is the University saying, "We approve of our students serving as guinea pigs for this vaccine?"

 I understand that the University wants to generate income through business partnerships and advertising sponsorships, but I think the relationship with this drug manufacturer should be more carefully examined. Just because the FDA has given this vaccine its seal of approval does not insure safety in the present tense or long-run. 

Doesn't anyone remember Phen-fen? And look at how well the relationship with Pharmed worked out. 

Are they not bankrupt at this point amd facing federal indictment? You are judged by the company you keep, and I think FIU needs to examine the business it partners with.

Headline: Editorial: Students paying too heavy a price for unpaid tickets
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Rather than sticking to PantherSoft as a means of informing and enabling students to pay for parking tickets, The Department of Parking and Transportation is outsourcing all tickets to a private collection agency, which will mar students' credit score if tickets are left unpaid. 

Sending tickets to an independent collection agency is pointless; the University already withholds a student's degree after graduation. Many students who have outstanding debts, like unpaid parking tickets, are not allowed to register for classes. Isn't that enough?

A measly $20 parking ticket isn't worth ruining a student's credit, especially after a student has paid thousands of dollars for tuition, books and over priced food. These tickets are even more of an inconvenience for seniors who are about to enter the workforce. Many employers are checking credit scores to determine whether or not applicants are responsible enough to pay their bills on time. 

PantherSoft lists all outstanding fees student may have and blocks students from registering for classes until all fees are paid. It would have been a more reasonable solution to utilize this application as means of collecting these fees in a prompt and far more convenient manner. However, in spite of the benefit that came of this program, it seemed that when PantherSoft was used as the means of collection there was a degree of inconsistency in the notification of students. 

Some students complained of there being no holds placed on their account, in spite of the fact that their ticket remained unpaid.  

Rather than going the distance to revamp the notification system within PantherSoft, Parking and Transportation is making strides to expedite collections through other means that may affect students detrimentally. 

Even though the University is collecting unpaid parking tickets, it is not even getting the full amount it charges students, as the collection agency keeps a portion of the money. 

Parking and Transportation needs to clarify its reasoning for implementing this policy, as opposed to remedying the inconsistencies in the PantherSoft system. It is unfair to burden students in a time when the costs of getting an education is so great.

Headline: PARTING WAYS: Final home games memorable for seniors
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Senior night encompasses what athletics should represent: recognition, excitement and camaraderie.

As three fall sports concluded their respective seasons, several Golden Panther student-athletes wore gold and blue in front of FIU fans for one last time.

Fans saw seniors from the women's and men's soccer teams and the women's volleyball team play their last home games of the 2007 season and bid farewell to upperclassmen who devoted years of practice to FIU athletics. 

Senior nights are a roller coaster of emotion for most players, because they step out of their usual character for one moment. 

A culmination of years of hard work builds up in one night and there is still a game the players have to play. 

It is especially difficult for those who dedicated four years of service to the University.

Rather than honoring student-athletes for the number of victories or the amount of money they bring to the program, for one night, the athletic department thanks the players for devoting years of sacrifice to FIU. 

And for one night, the players are not just a number on a uniform, but a person returning gratitude to his or her fans and peers.

Although some students cannot fathom how collegiate athletes are given full scholarships to spike or kick a ball, obtaining a free ride in college requires years of practice and discipline. 

Senior night allows the barrier between fans and student-athletes to be crossed in a professional fashion. 

Fans have an opportunity to see the players in a different light. They get to see players' emotions. 

Senior night humanizes student-athletes for fans and makes them realize that fans and athletes are first and foremost students.

Watching the journey end with a team that provided support, mentors and friends for years is a difficult task.

Playing just one year with a team requires spending a lot of time with teammates. 

From practices to training camp to the actual games, teammates spend the majority of their time with each other.

A bond is created that coaches hope transfers to the field or court. And the bond usually stretches into players' personal lives and evolves into true friendship. 

The friendships between the players make the last game at home even more memorable.

Even though most of the special friendships created by athletes carry over years after leaving FIU, the last game at home is the final contest where the players compete as allies for one institution. 

There is little to no chance that another game like senior night can be recreated. 

Family members come to watch the result of years of diligence come to a halt before their eyes, most notably those family members who contributed to developing their loved one's athletic abilities. 

FIU Athletics has endured some negative publicity over the last two years. 

However, that negativity melts away watching the excitement that the final home game produces. 

The exuberant atmosphere reminds fans that the majority of FIU's controversies are due to faulty infrastructure and not because of individual athletes' mishaps.

On senior night, these individual athletes have a chance to write the final page of their Golden Panther careers.

Senior setter Keila Oliveira leaves her mark on FIU as an essential cornerstone in Golden Panthers volleyball history. 

Last season was the volleyball programs most successful campaign largely in part due to Oliveria. 

When she arrived to FIU, she helped freshman outside hitters Yarimar Rosa and Olga Vergun develop into players that will raise the esteem of Golden Panthers' volleyball.

On the schedule it is listed as just one game, yet senior night comprises all the elements that make it worth watching sports.

Headline: Men's Soccer: Team wins season's last home game
Author: Luca Messina / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team won an non-conference game impressively Nov. 7 at University Park 2-0 on Senior Night against Florida Gulf Coast University. 

The final home game of the season was marked by energetic senior play and an explosive performance from sophomore Christian Caporaletti. 

FIU (3-12-2, 2-5-0 Conference USA) played determined in the first half but couldn't get on the board. 

The team responded well in the second half as Caporaletti scored in the 66th and 87th minute. 

"It feels really good," said Caporaletti, who scored his second and third goals of the season. 

"I missed a lot of goals during the season, so it feels great that they finally start to go in. It's too bad it's so late in the season, but at least we got a win for the seniors."

FGCU (8-10-1) hung in tough but could only muster five shots overall. 

Despite a collective effort in their final home game, this regular season, as whole, was a disappointment from a record and offensive standpoint.

First year coach Munga Eketebi mentioned how the rough season was a tale of two different stories.

 "At first I think we couldn't score and then we let in stupid soft goals,

" he said. "We just have to score more goals; you either do or don't. There is no real remedy. And we can't give up soft goals either."

 The team averaged less than one goal per game this season. In addition, the team was also shutout seven times. 

Despite the disappointing season, seniors Ainsley Deer and Richard Martinez showed support for Eketebi when asked about the rookie coach's first year at the helm. 

"I think he had a lot of tough luck this year," said Deer, who tallied an assist on Caporaletti's first goal. "He's a good coach with good ideas and was a bit unlucky." 

Martinez expressed Eketebi's knowledge and sense of belonging here at FIU. 

"He is a great coach," he said. "I learned a lot from him. He has been an assistant here for many years and hopefully he can build this program up and have a ranked team." 

Having support was important for Eketebi this year as his team often couldn't compete with strong ranked teams such as Southern Methodist University, Tulsa and the University of Michigan.

The Golden Panthers were outscored 1-13 by the three aforementioned ranked teams. 

Underclassmen such as Juan Guerra, Steven Jair Cabas, Levi Coleman and Christian Caporaletti provide a sense of hope for the squad next year. 

Munga believes that recruiting fresh talent will surely make a difference for next year.

With the combination of the current core players returning and a good recruiting class, fans could expect a young team that could be exciting to watch. 

Guerra, who is the team's leading scorer, was impressive this year flashing his quick speed and strong shooting ability. 

Coleman often played tough and was always looking to set up scoring opportunities through his bulky size. 

His playing time and performance was hindered by a nagging injury.

But another year of Guerra and Coleman together may be the answer to the team's offensive woes. 

The team's most productive games featured the duo connecting and communicating to dissect defenses.

Finally, Jair Cabas showed his scoring potential as he netted three goals on the season, ranking him second on the team. 

With Senior Night and home field advantage behind them, it's off to the Conference USA Championship Tournament in Birmingham, Ala.

 Judging by this season's performances this season, the team cannot be  realistically expected to go to very far into the tournament, but players believe the team is better that its record indicates.

"It's easy to be demoralized with the losses," Deer said. "But even though you're down, you have to keep your morale up and keep fighting. You have to be strong."

Headline: Raja Bell remembers college days
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Raja Bell played two seasons for FIU where he led the team scoring each year. He currently plays for the Phoenix Suns, who played the Miami Heat on Nov. 9 at the American Airlines Arena. He sat down with The Beacon to talk about his time at FIU and his career.


Q: You had a pretty good career playing basketball at FIU. What are some memories you have from your two season's as a FIU Golden Panther?

A: I met some of my best friends to this day at FIU. I met my wife at FIU. Just general life around the University was fantastic. As far as basketball memories go. I remember one year at homecoming, it was against Florida Atlantic, we were able to open the bleachers up at the top and actually pack in some people there. 

And obviously the Michigan game to start my senior season when we beat them and everybody rushed the court. That was just a euphoric moment in my FIU career.



Q: After two years with the Utah Jazz, you signed with the Phoenix Suns and reunited with your former Mavericks teammate Steve Nash. Have you and Steve been close since then and what have you learned from playing with him?

A: Steve is one of those guys that I was able to remain close to even when we didn't play on the same team. 

And that says a lot about a guy because in this league it's easy to forget about guys that you played with. 

Since we've been back together, we've become good friends. Our wives are good friends. 

I love his daughters; he loves my sons. On the court you learn from him. I pick his brain all the time, because he's just that good. 

The best thing about him is his competitive spirit. I think young players and guys in my stage of their careers could learn from him.



Q: In 2007, you were involved in a playoff series with the Los Angeles Lakers. How were you still physically and emotionally able to play in game five only six hours after your son Dia was born?

A: That was a joyous occasion and as straining as it wound up being, maybe four hours after the game I was still running on pure adrenaline. 

So it wasn't hard for me to be jacked up for that game, because it had been such an incredible day. The birth was in Phoenix and I slept on a little sofa bed type of thing in her room. 

She went through labor the whole night and told me to get rest for my game the next game.



Q: Even though you play in Phoenix you still live in Miami in the off-season. How would you feel if one day you found yourself wearing a Miami Heat jersey and playing in Miami?

A: That's a tough question, and I'm conflicted because part of me wants to retire in Phoenix and win championships there and be part of the Phoenix family for the rest of my life. 

As a young boy, I grew up loving the Miami Heat. I was here when the franchise came to town. So part of me wouldn't mind riding off into the sunset in a Heat jersey for one of my last years. 

That's a tough question. One that may answer itself and I don't have to give you one now. Laughs.





The Beacon will be running a further profile on Raja Bell on 11/16.

Headline: International Studies International Careers Expo 2007
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Students majoring in anything from international studies to hospitality and tourism management can receive an introduction to employment opportunities during International Education Week.

The International Studies International Careers Expo 2007 will take place during International Education week Nov. 13 at University Park and Nov. 14 at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

The Student Government Association will be co-sponsoring the expo, along with the International Student and Scholar Services program and the Career Services office.

The expo is designed to link global awareness with job readiness and to offer students internationally-oriented internships, academic programs and study-aboard opportunities. The two-day event will focus on themes such as careers in international business, law, hospitality and public service; as well as a non-profit section. 

Cristyn Casey, program coordinator for the Department of Transnational and Comparative Studies Center, said she was motivated to help and bring these events together and has been in the planning process for the past three months. She likes the idea of students having the chance to do something different and believes FIU has all the resources to make the expo successful for both the students and the University.

"We have a lot of strengths at FIU. We are pulling together all of our different departments and areas of studies and encourage students who are interested in international careers to take advantage of this event," Casey said. 

Christine I. Caly-Sanchez, one of the event coordinators, wants to give the students the prospect of studying outside of the University. 

"To create a desire in students to have an international experience and study abroard is one of the goals for the expo," she said. 

UP students will meet companies from Latin America, Asia and Europe, such as Terra Networks USA and the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce USA. These companies will hold workshops on international business career tracks.

Diplomats such as Jack Twiess-Quarles van Ufford from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Philippe Vinogradoff, the Consul General of France in Miami, will speak at the event about international careers in diplomacy. 

There will also be students on the panel who studied abroad and will be sharing their experiences with other students.

Last year, the ISIC Expo had 750 students in attendance at UP. This year Caly-Sanchez expects even more students to attend and take advantage of the event.

BBC's expo will focus more on hospitality and tourism management businesses as well as careers in communications. It will also have a panelist of students sharing their study abroad experiences. BBC's expo held 250 students last year. 

Students who attend will the have the opportunity to network with over 50 exhibitors, including 20 FIU programs which all promote opportunities that can lead to globally engaging careers.

"All the companies that came last year recruited students and some even offered them job opportunities. The companies want to hire students and want to come back," Caly-Sanchez said.

According to Caly-Sanchez, the event is also a good way to expose students who are not interested in working internationally and might reconsider the idea after attending.

"This is the only way, this is the way to show FIU the [businesses] inside," she said.
