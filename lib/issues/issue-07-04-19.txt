Headline: Pay cut under way for future SGA members
Author: Jessica Solis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Members of the recently appointed Student Government Councils at University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus will see their pay lowered or eliminated for several positions, due to a budget revision that reduces the salaries of three major organizations within Campus Life. They include the Student Government Association as well as the Student Programming Council and the Student Organizations Council.

According to a document sent to The Beacon via e-mail specifying the pay compensations of SGC-UP for the 2006-2007 school year, the current pay is effective until May 4.  The e-mail was sent by Phillip Hamilton, senior clerk for SGC-UP. According to Zachary Trautenberg, outgoing SGC-BBC comptroller and finance chair, the current BBC council's pay stops on April 19.

The University-Wide Budget Council, comprised of nine students who are members of both councils, voted for the pay cut at a March 10 meeting. At least six of the members of the council had to vote for the approval of the pay cut. 

The 2006-2007 university-wide budget of $10.2 million allowed for $200,000 in pay compensations for SGC at UP and BBC that were evenly split between both campuses and helped pay its respective members. Under the old budget, salaries varied between positions in each campus. According to Trautenberg, who voted against the pay cuts at the budget hearing, the SGC-BBC president made $10,000 this year and the SGC-BBC vice president and comptroller made $7,500 this year. The SGC-BBC cabinet members made $3,000 and the representatives made $2,500 this year. 

In the same e-mail sent to The Beacon by Hamilton, SGC-UP salary figures were the same as SGC-BBC.

The revisions made at the March 10 meeting by the budget council reduced the pay compensations to $100,000, which will then be split in half to pay several SGC positions and fund programming on both campuses. 

According to members in SGC-UP and BBC, such as Trautenberg, the money saved from reducing pay for student government officers will go to student programming such as concerts, lectures and events that provide free food for students.

Trautenberg believes that cutting a small portion of a large budget will not provide a significant increase in student programming.

"Unfortunately, I don't see that money benefiting the students that much more than helping the students," he said. "If I could tell you that this was a clear benefit to the students, and you were going to have five more concerts a year, I would say I'm all for it, but I don't see enough upside, unfortunately."

Newly appointed SGC-BBC President Katiana "Kathy" Saintable, is optimistic for results, but says it cannot be predicted whether the reduced pay will help to improve student programming.

"The more money that's invested in certain programs and services on campus - if they have the funds to work at their maximum effectiveness, [it] will be something that will benefit the university as a whole," Saintable said. "We're hoping that it will pay off in the end."

The smaller amount allotted to pay compensations reduced the old salaries, but it has not yet been decided by the incoming council how much members of the new council will be paid, since it is the new council which determines how its members will be paid. The pay of the new councils for both campuses will be decided over the summer.

"It's up to the new council how they want to do it, but what we came up with was a small guideline for them," Trautenberg said. 

According to Trautenberg, the guidelines for SGC-BBC proposed a $6,000 salary for the president and an approximate $1,100 salary for cabinet members and representatives.

The council at UP is leaving it to the new administration to determine payment amounts according to Hamilton during a phone interview.

"As of now, the specific salary for each of the positions hasn't been decided," Hamilton said. "That is to be decided by the next administration."

The reduced pay compensations also eliminated pay for previously paid positions in SGC at UP and BBC such as director of technology advancement.

Salaries for several positions in the Student Programming Council and the Student Organizations Council at UP and BBC will also be lowered as well, since their pay depends on the amount the SGC president makes yearly.

 According to Trautenberg, at BBC, the SOC and SPC salary is approximately 30 to 40 percent of the SGC president's salary. At UP, it cannot exceed 35 percent, as stated in the SGA constitution. Previously, under the old budget, the SPC-BBC and SOC-BBC presidents made $4,400 yearly. Their new salary will be $3,500, distributed on a bi-weekly basis. Salary distribution for positions that earn less than $1,000 will be split by semester. 

Janette Francois, SPC-BBC president, and Vanessa Robinson, SPC-BBC vice president, would not comment on the salary revisions that are being implemented.

Many do not seem to mind the pay cuts and eliminations, such as Pioneer Winter, SGC-BBC student union board member.

"If you like what you're doing, then the pay that you're getting shouldn't matter," Winter said. 

Winter did not know his SGC position included pay until a week after he applied.

Other students, such as Gabriel Labrador, outgoing representative- at-large for SGC-BBC, see the paycheck as a perk, but not as the main priority for joining SGC.

"The pay was never what motivated me, but I do know that it might not necessarily be the sole motivation, but it might be the extra incentive to work," Labrador said. "I really don't think that anybody is in student government either at [UP] or here just for the paycheck," he said. "Really, it was never that much - you can't survive on it." 

Camilo Silva, outgoing SGC-BBC president, was opposed to the pay cuts, but said he sees both sides of the issue.

"When you pay someone, you have accountability in the sense that you can be assured that a student is working," he said. "There's also the other view that the students, when they're involved, they should do it from the heart."

Headline: Students look forward to campus renovations
Author: Christina Lemus / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With many improvements underway, the Biscayne Bay Campus is currently in the process of a makeover. 

The facilities management department at BBC started working on many projects at the beginning of 2007 including construction plans, new landscaping projects and upgrades on utilities. 

"The construction on campus shows a step towards a beautiful campus," said junior Veronica Rivera, "It will make students proud to be a part of BBC."

The primary construction zones on campus are currently in the south end of the Wolfe University Center that leads to Academic I. In this corridor, construction is under way for a new cafeteria and fitness center, which can be seen by looking through a newly erected glass door where a dry wall once stood.

"A bigger and better cafeteria is exciting because it will mean more room and more food and probably more students will want to eat on campus," Rivera said.

Elie "Elias" Bardawil, Director of Campus Recreation, Life and Orientation at BBC, was unavailable for comment.

There are also upgrades on the utilities around campus.

Honoriu Filimon, coordinator of construction projects for the department of facilities management, mentioned one of the projects would involve renovations within the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.

These renovations, which are still in the planning process, will include bathroom renovations, fire alarm upgrades, and replacing the building's roof as well as the primary windows with impact resistant glass.

Students who utilize the building, such as junior Veronica Sanchez, majoring in hospitality and tourism management, may be negatively affected by the future construction in the building.

"The sounds of loud banging may be distracting during class time, so I hope for students that the construction doesn't start until after class hours or [during] summer break," Sanchez said.

A work date for construction within the building is still being discussed.

According to Filimon, another future project his team will be working on is the large window on the first floor of the BBC Library.

The window will be replaced with impact resistant glass to prepare for the unexpected Florida weather.

This project, according to Filimon, will cost FIU over $100,000 but is a project he considers to be "very beneficial and a good safety precaution for the campus."

Filimon's team will also be working within AC I replacing damaged doors with new steel doors and renovating the bathroom with fresh paint and fixed utilities.

Filimon said all of the projects he and his team are working on this year will cost approximately over $1 million.

Along with all of the construction being done around BBC, there is also a large amount of landscaping being done. According to the landscapers working outside of Academic II during the first week of April, all of the old and dead grass in front of ACI and AC II will be dug up and replaced with new grass.

Walking alongside both buildings, there were also fresh flowers planted to help further the beautification process.

According to senior Dennis Hernandez, all of the money going towards the beautification process of BBC as a whole is going to the right places. 

"Any money that is used towards improving the campus is money well spent because when the campus looks nicer, students feel more proud attending it," Hernandez said.

Headline: Faculty Spotlight: Stephen Fjellman, Professor Dept. of Sociology and Anthropology
Subheadline: Globe-trotting professor hopes to take it easy after retirement
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Two hundred and sixty-five. 

The number represents how many baseball parks Stephen Fjellman has visited in a lifetime, demonstrated by a U.S. map in his office studded with green thumbtacks. Single, double, AAA, major league - they're all there. Red thumbtacks represent future visits.

"It's the perfect game. It's the only game that theoretically doesn't have to end and it's the only game where the defense has the ball," Fjellman said. 

Come July 3, the retiring anthropology and sociology professor will be able to catch more games.

Twenty-nine years ago, Fjellman came from Harvard University as an assistant professor and was immediately drawn to the Biscayne Bay Campus when he first saw the double sized trailers he would be teaching in. 

"When I first came here, I thought this place was really cool. "They actually offered me a lot of money. I got a significant raise and I thought, 'God am I lucky,'" Fjellman said. 

His starting salary: $16,000. 

Since 1978, Fjellman has seen students come and go, and the University grow. Through it all, his mission has remained constant: Teach students to think for themselves and become jack-of-all-trades.

"It's not just enough to master a discipline. It's great to master a discipline because you become very good at something but there are no significant issues in the world that are discipline-based; they're all connected," Fjellman said.

As one of the founders of the Honors College, Fjellman tries to get students to make connections outside of class through study abroad programs.

Fjellman and John Kneski, associate dean of the Honors College, have sponsored the Italy study abroad program for the past 10 years. 

On his first trip to Italy, Kneski recalled that his debit card and credit card weren't working. Without any hesitation, Fjellman took out $500 from his checking account and gave it to Kneski, whom he had just met on the trip and now considers a best friend. 

"I can't imagine doing the trip with anyone but Steve," Kneski said. "If you need a friend to talk to, you can't [find] a better friend than Steve."

Despite retiring this semester, Fjellman will continue to sponsor the study abroad program. 

Aside from plans to travel to Europe and catch some more minor league baseball, Fjellman wants to visit his daughter Melina and grandchildren Tate, 2, and Tynan, 4, who live in California. 

"All travel teaches you stuff you didn't know. It teaches you stuff you didn't know about places, people, their ways and about their problems," Fjellman said. "Everything broadens you. Everything makes you a citizen of the world."

Despite his baseball excursions around the country, Fjellman has done fieldwork in Mexico, Kenya, Cameroon and Walt Disney World as an anthropologist. His fieldwork in the Magic Kingdom led to the publication of his book, Vinyl Leaves: Walt Disney World and America. This book established the groundwork for Disney studies in colleges and universities throughout the nation.

"He is a vast storehouse of knowledge that you wouldn't expect," said junior Ameila Ciffone.

Junior Simone Bailey, a sociology student who has taken five classes with Fjellman, said she has learned more from him as a person than from the subjects  he teaches in class and appreciates the standards he holds to students. 

"He's a fun guy who is incredibly intelligent and he's not pretentious and is very down to Earth. He's remained constant throughout my classes and you can tell he has a passion for what he teaches," Bailey said.

The Connecticut native learned quickly that his calling was in the classroom. Fjellman served as department chair and associate dean of the Honors College before returning to teach. After all that, he says he's relaxed now more than ever. 

"I'm pretty happy with the way things are," he said. "I've done all the things I was supposed to do. I grew up, got degrees, married, divorced, had kids, got a job, tenure, published a paper [and] a book, got all the teaching awards the university offers [and] was an administrator who helped build a school. What else am I supposed to do?"

Headline: BBC's Birthday Bash brings mixed feelings
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
A group of professors gathered in 1977 to inaugurate a new building, which next to a few trailers, stood as the only structure by the Biscayne Bay. 

The building, today known as the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management building, was the center of attention again June 12, when people gathered at its patio to commemorate the Biscayne Bay Campus' 30th anniversary and its many achievements.

Former and present students and administrators came together at the event to talk about the campus's history, plans for expansion, resources and future in the first of a series of events that will take place throughout the year to commemorate the campus's anniversary.

Prominent members of the FIU community took the stage during the ceremony to paint a picture of BBC's past, such as Lillian Lodge Kopenhaver, dean and professor of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication. 

Kopenhaver said that the small size of the then North Miami Campus was not what she and the others saw at the ribbon-cutting ceremony 30 years ago, when Harold Crosby, then the University's president, talked about campus expansion. 

"That day when Crosby opened up the campus and said that this campus was filled with promise, he meant it. You see the promise in the years of the campus' growth," said Kopenhaver to the large crowd in the patio.	

The celebration included appearances by FIU alumni such as Noel Browne, now an R&B singer, and Nadia Turner, former finalist of the popular TV show American Idol. They performed on stage and sang BBC the birthday song.

Turner commented on how much the campus changed since she lived in its dorms while earning her degree in advertising almost five years ago.

"It's surreal [to be here]. I walked the grounds with my book bag and I am now being honored for my accolades," Turner said.

A time capsule, put together by members of the Student Government Council at BBC, was presented at the event. Where the time capsule will be placed until it is open again a few decades from now, is still being debated.

Also during the ceremony, the "30 at 30" scholarship competition, which will award 30 scholarships to 30 students fully admitted to FIU, was announced. Applications for the scholarships, which are funded by an endowment from the Aventura Marketing Council, will be available online at bbc.fiu.edu.

The event closed with the cutting of the BBC birthday cake by Katiana "Kathy" Saintable, SGC-BBC president, Cathy Akens, assistant vice president of student affairs, and Damian Fernandez, the University's vice provost.

"It was symbolic of different areas of the campus coming together to celebrate what we have accomplished and it was also a celebration of our commitment to continue to improve BBC," Akens said.

According to Fernandez, the campus will expand by bringing more start-to-finish programs to BBC, such as the new business and marketing programs starting in the fall. He added that he is hoping to have a new decision for student housing by the end of this fall. 

"Clearly, the story of FIU is a story of success. It's a story of Miami and the growth of Miami and the growth of an institution that is here to serve the people of this community. Today, when we look back we're also looking forward," Fernandez said. "I see that we are at a turning point, and that BBC will continue to grow with Miami." 

While many praised BBC's accomplishments, some of the former university administrators brought up the differences between BBC and University Park, including BBC's lack of resources when compared to UP.  

Gregory Wolfe, former FIU president from 1979 to 1986, said that while BBC has many possibilities, many plans that have been made for the campus were never fulfilled. He added that the plans to expand BBC programs have been overdue.

"The population at the end of this county is growing. It has the highest, richest income areas in the whole Miami-Dade County region and the most underutilized academically and I think that's unfortunate," he said. "The population is being underserved. It deserves more and better."

Raul Moncarz, former vice provost and professor of the College of Business, said that BBC had challenges with certain programs moving to UP, such as nursing, due to the lack of enrollment.

While Moncarz congratulated Fernandez for expanding more programs at BBC and for making the campus look as beautiful as it ever has, he added that Fernandez will have a hard time dealing with the campus's limited resources. BBC will either become a main campus and important part of the University as a whole, or it will break off into its own independent campus, he said.

"Many people feel they are not getting enough resources," Moncarz said. "The students need more and we need to expand. We are all part of one university, so it should be one university. This area should be getting the same treatment that the other area is getting."

Headline: The Matter of Manners: Students dissect rules of etiquette
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Knights in shining armor strictly followed a code of chivalry in their treatment of fair maidens with pointed headdresses. Victorian ladies in elaborate gowns poured over detailed etiquette books. Our society seems to have discarded such obsessions with correct and proper behavior, which our parents' and grandparents' generation love to point out. "Back in my day," they reminisce, "there was such a thing as common courtesy." But in spite of their memories, the question remains, to what extent are good manners still with us? 

"I don't think [chivalry] is dead," said sophomore Janell Benzaquen. "[But] I think the only manners that still exist are the ones given by parents and it was a priority for them." 

In modern times, good manners are less of a societal code than a personal responsibility to pass to one's kin.

For some students, such as junior Johnny Betancourt, manners are still based on simply what's acceptable.

 "I think that men in general aren't as polite as they used to be toward women," Betancourt said. "Lots of guys now don't open doors for girls. But there are examples of manners that we still have, or people will think you're gross, like chewing with your mouth closed."

And so, although some examples of courtesy have diminished over time, basic decorum seems to remain constant. 

"[These] fall into the 'how would you like to be treated' category," Betancourt continued.

Most would agree with Betancourt in saying that manners matter precisely because of this, because they speak of a subtle empathic bond between strangers.

Professor Richard Tardanico, chairperson of the sociology department, explains the homeostasis that results from consciously or subconsciously following behavioral guidelines.

"[All rules] are important because they permit predictability, routine actions and make the world more secure," Tardanico said.

Yet to some who value bluntness and forthrightness, society's standards of politeness come dangerously close to a façade, a mask placed over true thoughts and feelings. This leads to questions about why standards of politeness developed at all and about just how valuable or harmful they can be.

Betancourt believes that the negative implications of good manners originated far back in history.

"To some extent [manners] were designed to separate the aristocracy from the common people," Betancourt said.

Often these superimposed mores can divide communities, hindering them nearly as much as they benefit from them. Tardanico explained that they could be used for a false sense of superiority.

"It's a way of isolating yourself from other classes," Tardanico said. "If an ethnic group is reaching your level, it's a way of excluding them nonetheless. Like other basic rules about who belongs and who doesn't, there's constant conflict and negotiation. Not only can good manners be a tool with which to push others off the social ladder, but they can also compromise authenticity, replacing it with artificiality."

Tardanico explained that social psychology recognizes this and attempts to address it.

"Social order is all about masking social turmoil," Tardanico said. "That's what Freud was about - our inner psyche that society's rules squash."

He said society has also developed ways to release tension associated with such expectations by forming outlets for exhibition.

"That's why we have rituals that allow you to vent," Tardanico said. "Mardi Gras, the bar, sports events, fraternity parties."

Others, like Benzaquen, are just grateful that manners developed and don't wonder what hidden intentions may lurk.

"I take people the way they portray themselves," Benzaquen said. "If they're being polite, I believe they really are polite."

Headline: Cram Jam aims to encourage students via ice cream, massages
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Students studying late inside the Green Library on April 23 and 24 can take a break in the Graham Center at Cram Jam, an event hosted during finals week in the fall and spring semesters. The event is a collaborative effort between Student Government Association, Campus Life, GC, the Panther Card Office and the Porter Davis Game Room.

Throughout the two days, FIU students can get an array of items and services at no cost, including Coldstone ice cream, Rockstar energy drinks, blue books and massages. In addition, Fresh Food Company will be open from 11:45 p.m. to 1 a.m. providing free breakfast food to hungry crammers and the first floor of the library will remain open for 24 hours. 

 "With the cramming and the stress, it's imperative that SGA does something to help students as the end of the semester nears," SGA Marketing Coordinator Jean Roseme said.

According to Roseme, one major difference from previous Cram Jams is the operating hours of the game room, which will be open from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. on both days.

"Last year, the game room wasn't open during finals," Roseme said.

 Because of the "first come, first served" event policy, it is recommended that students arrive early to GC in order to take advantage of the giveaways, according to Roseme. 

Sophomore Gabriela Morales, who is majoring in education, views Cram Jam as a needed break during one of the most stressful weeks of a semester.

 "It's a good stress reliever and you don't have to go very far from your study area," Morales said. Other students such as sophomore Alvaro Quiñones find the event useful but somewhat distracting. 

"People should be studying during finals," Quiñones said. "You should leave the loud music for afterwards. Free food and coffee are good because people need it, but the music is a bad idea because it distracts people's focus."

Anyone who wishes to partake in the free food and services must show a valid Panther Card. For students who misplaced their ID or require a duplicate, the Panther Card Office will be open from 11 p.m. - 1 a.m. during Cram Jam and will offer $5 duplicate IDs, which normally cost $15.

Headline: Trivial Pursuit...a pop culture column: Summer brings fun in sun, horrible sequels
Author: Reuben Pereira
&nbsp;
Summer is more than a month away but in Hollywood, it's going to be here in two weeks. The most important and lucrative period in the film industry, the summer movie season is when movie studios launch their biggest, most bloated and flashy films, all fighting for number 1 in the box office.

The history of the summer movie season is quite illustrated. It used to be a time when Hollywood dumped their most unworthy and unwanted films. It wasn't until Steven Spielberg's Jaws was released in theaters in the summer of 1975 when that concept changed. The film revolutionized the industry by becoming a box-office phenomenon and the first film to gross more than a $100 million. Two years later, George Lucas followed suit with the release of Star Wars, solidifying summer releases as one of the most moneymaking seasons for film releases.

Year after year, Hollywood started churning out big budget, senseless, high-concept films that audiences would embrace just by the visuals. Eight of the top ten grossing films of all time have been summer releases with the only exceptions on that list being the Oscar record holders Titanic and The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, which essentially played against zero competition for two months.

However, in recent years, those numbers have slummed. In 2005, the film industry went through its worst box office drought in decades. Blame for the sudden drop in sales could go to blind green-lighting on every sequel, prequel or remake idea presented in Hollywood conference rooms. Now it's time to feel the repercussions.

No less than 18 sequels or remakes are being released this summer. While I really am looking forward to many of these films, I question the integrity of the people who approve these products - isn't there anything that is new, original and creative out there? There has never been a time where the only film I'm really looking forward to that isn't a sequel or a remake is an animated film by Pixar. Judging by Pixar's and director Brad Bird's record (Bird also directed and wrote The Incredibles) Ratatouille, which comes out this June, will most likely be the best film of the summer.

Of the 18 sequels or prequels coming out this summer, the big three are sure to be the ones released in May: Spider-Man 3, Shrek the Third and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. I predict at least a combined $700 million gross for these three films alone. Previous installments of these three films have all broke opening weekend records and have been the highest grossing films of their respective years. However, this summer, it's possible that they all burn into each other's fan bases and split the grosses, all disappointing in the long run.

June will bring us more sequels in the form of the unnecessary in Ocean's 13 and Evan Almighty, the sequel to Bruce Almighty with Steve Carrell reviving the role of Evan Baxter. The month will end in what looks like the best of the June sequels - the return of John McClane after more than a decade. Bruce Willis will return as his most famous character in the fourth installment of the Die Hard series entitled Live Free or Die Hard.

July is the month of adaptations, which kicks off with Transformers, produced by Steven Spielberg and opening on the coveted Independence Day weekend.

The fifth Harry Potter movie also debuts to coincide with the release of the seventh and final Potter novel. The Simpsons will also make their big screen debut along with what looks like an absolute catastrophe, the musical adaptation of Hairspray - which was already a film to begin with. The month will end with Matt Damon starring and Paul Greengrass directing The Bourne Ultimatum.

So, now that you know what to expect, I hope you spend your money wisely before running out for every flashy movie that ends with the number "2." Looking on the brighter side of life, at least there will be plenty of time to get a tan.

Headline: Decreasing console prices help old technology linger
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Every few years, the video game console war resumes with companies racing to release their latest gaming machines while trying to come out on top. Currently the sales battle being fought is between the Nintendo Wii and the PlayStation 3 and it appears the Wii is winning, at least thus far.

At first glance, the price difference between the two systems is what is giving the Wii the edge. Even when compared to the basic PS3, the Wii is $200 cheaper. Cost does play a factor into the overall popularity of the Wii, according to junior James Chung who works at a local GameStop store. 

"It's the hype right now," Chung said. "A lot of kids want it and parents buy for the kids."

According to Chung, his GameStop has sold more Wii systems than PS3s, but the high Wii sales were only partially due to the lower cost of the system. 

"I have one myself," Chung said. "But I got it because of the hype."

At the end of Dec. 2006, the Wii had sold 1.1 million units while the PS3 sold 490,700, stated in an article found on MSNBC.com. Locally, electronic stores such as the Best Buy and Target on Kendall Drive have reported repeated sellouts of the Wii while the PS3 showed to be less successful throughout the holiday season.

One speculation behind low PS3 sales is the amount of games available for the system. Game developers are weary to invest in a gaming machine with low sales - if the system is doing poorly, their game will more than likely do poorly as well.

Senior Daniel Rodriguez, who bought both systems, claims the PS3 is the better gaming machine, however.

"The graphics are better on the PS3 and it implements the Blue Ray [disc format] well," Rodriguez said. "[The PS3] doesn't have as many games as the Wii, but the PS3 is a universal multimedia center."

To some consumers, such as Rodriguez, the PS3 while being more expensive than the Wii, is still a better investment because of blue-ray technology - which not only boasts the ability to display media in high definition but holds up to five times the amount or memory of a DVD. Currently, a Sony blue ray player retails for about $800 on Amazon.com while the PS3 retails for $599.99.

Because price continues to be a factor especially in the youth market, some students find themselves holding on to their PlayStation 2, which outsold the Wii and PS3 in December, selling 1.4 million units according to the MSNBC article. Recently, its price was also dropped to $130.

For Yusiley Sierra and her sister, the PS2 will continue to be their choice system. 

"We were thinking about getting the Wii," Sierra said. "We will be playing with the [PS2] as long as they're making games. [People] just have to find systems that fit their budget."

More than 101 million PS2 units and over a billion pieces of software for the system have sold worldwide and in the United States, the PS2 continues to make up about 55 percent of all console sales according to Sony Computer Entertainment America.

Author: Melinda Boone /Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Boston ska septet Big D and the Kids Table performed at Ft. Lauderdale's Revolution nightclub on April 13 in support of their recently released album Strictly Rude, the band's fourth full-length record. Released on March 20, Strictly Rude features the group's trademark brass sounds while incorporating piano and organ into the mix.

Sean: Through an Internet dating service. We met at Berkley College of Music in 1996 and we were all friends and we're all musicians, so what better thing to do than play music with your friends?



Q: Are you all from Boston?

Sean: We're all from New England.  Does anyone want to disagree with me and say a different story on how we met?

Dave: Did you say that we all love each other?

Sean: Oh yes, and we all love each other.

Dave: I'll tell you one thing, I know we started the band not to start a band like Poison and Guns'N'Roses, like "we are going to L.A. and we're going to do this." It was more like, "I've got nothing to do on Thursday, you want to play?" and we had nothing to do everyday of the week, so we just played.



Q: So when did you become an official band? When you got t-shirts?

Dan:  We always make a joke every time, like we take a tiny little baby step up and we're a real band now. We always make that joke, like, "We've got t-shirts, we're a real band."

Sean:  Actually the first show ever played by Big D was at a frat party that said "Boston's favorite party band." That was the first gig and that was weird.

Dan:  It went great, but it was kind of bizarre that we were already a favorite party band when we haven't even played a party or a show yet.



Q: So who are some of your influences as a band and also on the new album Strictly Rude?

Sean: For the whole band, there's a few that everybody likes and then we all have our own personal influences, but a band like the Flaming Lips, we really like what they're about. They have a strong do-it-yourself ethic and they're very experimental, but there [are] always the standards like the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Operation Ivy. We all love Tom Petty and a ton of reggae.

Dan: The new record is mostly ska with a little bit of reggae, a little bit of dub and a little tiny bit of punk in it.



Q: Does New England influence your sound at all?

Sean: Totally, it's a lot colder there. The attitude on the East Coast is way different then the attitude on the West Coast.  Sometimes we're all huddled in our basement in our practice space and I think that definitely affects the songwriting, but we wrote the latest album Strictly Rude during the summer so it definitely sounds different then our other records.



Q: Was there a specific sound you were looking for the new record and, if so, do you think you achieved it?

Sean:  We definitely wanted the biggest influence on this record to be a ska influence and we were talking to Side One Dummy, the record label, and they really wanted us to make a ska record, and we had plans to make a full dub record, a punk record, which we got to actually release as a split. It's an [extended play album] called Beijing to Boston and those are all pretty much punk songs.  But we definitely wanted to focus on the groove being a ska groove and the different ska grooves you can have. I think we got what we were going for.



Q: What's the worst you've ever had to eat while on tour?

Sean:  The worst thing I've ever seen anyone eat was Steve [Foote, bassist for the band] drink a kid's blood once in a pint glass.  The kid cut his hand and all the blood spilled into a cup and Steve went right up to it and took two huge swigs of it and that was pretty gross.



Q: So you guys are doing Warped Tour this summer, how have your previous experiences on Warped Tour been and are you looking forward to it again?

Dan:  You hear about bands complaining about how hard it is to be on Warped Tour and how much work it is, how hot it is, you don't get to shower as much, all that stuff.  But that is perfectly balanced by how incredibly fun it is on the tour, and then at the end of the day you really appreciate the moment where you get to have a beer and hang out with everybody and get to have a good time because you worked your ass off, so it's a perfect balance of working hard and playing hard.



Q: Do you guys have any pre-show rituals?

Sean:  Actually as we started the tour, we all have different handshakes for everyone in the band.  Dan's and I improvised every single night but it always starts off with an elbow.  Dave and I have a double reversal explosion, and everybody has something different.

Dave:  It's probably why we always start our set too late because everyone has to do a stupid handshake with everybody.

Headline: Shootings raise campus safety concerns
Author: C. Joel Marino / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
A man enters campus with a gun on a busy school day and no one takes notice until it's too late.

Shots ring out, students panic. The rampage doesn't seem to end.

Questions regarding campus safety and preparedness are being asked in colleges around the country - FIU included - days after a gunman took 32 lives during just such a rampage at Virginia Tech.

"When we're in this kind of environment, we don't anticipate something like this. But there's always the possibility, and we have to be ready for it," said Cathy Akens, assistant vice president of Student Affairs.

Though no similar incident has taken place in the University's history, Public Safety Chief Bill King says his department is ready to tackle any emergency scenario.

"I believe any crisis can be taken care of with the right precautions. This is a very safe campus," King said.

According to King, all on-duty officers would be dispatched to an emergency site if the situation requires it.

However, the department has been using a faulty radio system since last year.

"Yeah, we still have problems with the radio," said Lt. Frank Tomassini of Public Safety's investigation unit. "It's been an ongoing issue with us and it's still not resolved."

The radios are used to dispatch officers to scenes of crimes. 

The Beacon reported in December and early April that many officers have complained the faulty system could pose safety risks.

"We're very concerned with the views of the officers, and we want officers to feel confident with the radios, so we're working on this problem as best we can," King said. He also said there is no deadline set for when a new system would be implemented.

If the need arises, local city police officers would be called in to help during emergency situations. According to King, outside police forces can be easily reached.

After the extent of the emergency has been assessed, students would be made aware of an on-campus problem through a recently implemented system called InformaCast.

Recorded messages or live warnings would be broadcast through speakers and university telephone systems if so required.

Before any drastic measures - such as closing off campuses or mass evacuations - are announced, it would be up to the University's Emergency Management Group to decide proper courses of action.

This group is comprised of representatives from such campus organizations, departments and offices as Student Affairs, the Victim Advocacy Center, Public Safety and the Office of Housing and Residential Life, among others.

"I want to assure our university community that we have reviewed our extensive emergency response plans and feel that they are appropriate and ready," FIU President Modesto A. Maidique, a member of the group, said in a university-wide e-mail sent out a day after the shooting. "However, an event such as this requires us to revisit these plans to make sure they cover not only the likely contingencies, but also can adequately address an unimaginable disaster as that which befell Virginia Tech."

A list of any revisions to these plans was unavailable as of press time.

In the meantime, departments such as the Office of Housing and Residential Life are assessing their own emergency plans.

"The first thing we have to keep in mind is the safety of students," Joseph Mattachione, director of residential life, said. "There are procedures that if followed correctly can assure we reach that safety."

Resident assistants (students who supervise hallways at FIU's various residence halls) are instructed to call supervisors or Public Safety if they ever encounter a disturbance. 

They would also help evacuate residents in case of emergencies.

The last time an evacuation took place was last summer when students at Bay Vista housing were bused to University Park in anticipation of Tropical Storm Ernesto.

"I can't really say the specifics of what we'd do until the scenario arose," Mattachione said. "The most important thing is to be prepared, and then we wait."

Headline: Law students get top marks on Bar
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The last test any law student must take before finally becoming a lawyer is the Bar Examination-a difficult test that forces law students to demonstrate everything they have learned at law school. 

With the Spring semester coming to an end, the numbers are in, and the FIU College of Law is on top in two ranking categories. 

"It really helps our ranking," said Abe Spivak, a law student.

This past February, 554 students from 10 Florida law schools as well as 499 from non-Florida law schools sat down to take the Bar exam. Much to the pleasure of FIU's College of Law students and administration, FIU scored highest on the Bar Exam; 17 out of 18 (94 percent) of students who took the exam passed.

Other universities came close to FIU's score. The University of Miami had 20 out of 26 (77 percent) students pass, University of Florida 130 out of 156 (83 percent), Barry University 27 out of 39 (69 percent) and Stetson University 92 out of 112 (82 percent). 

The remaining Bar Exam results are as follows: Florida State University 30 out of 34 (88 percent), Nova Southeastern University 24 out of 50 (48 percent), St. Thomas University 23 out of 31 (74 percent), Florida Coastal University 47 out of 67 (70 percent), Florida A&M University 11 out of 21 (52 percent) and all non-Florida Law Schools 326 out of 499 (65 percent).

Leonard Strickman, dean of the College of Law, offered an explanation for the high scores.

 "We have a rigorous curriculum," he said. "I'm glad I didn't have to take it." 

Strickman also commented that he hopes scoring this high on the Bar would encourage current and future students to maintain that high level of excellence. 

In addition to ranking first in the exam, the College of Law was also ranked as being a third tier law school by U.S. News Magazine.

Of the four tiers created by U.S. News, most new law schools are ranked as being fourth tier. 

According to Strickman in the last 25 years, 21 law schools were accredited and of them only three, including FIU, ranked higher than fourth tier the first time around. 

The tiers are broken down into four parts. Tiers one and two are ranked numerically from numbers one to one hundred. The first tier ranks one through 50, with Yale being number one, and the second tier two ranks 51 through 100, with Arizona State ranking at 51. 

In tiers three and four, universities are listed alphabetically. Schools that fall into the third tier are relatively equal among themselves; the same is true for fourth tier schools.

 "We should have done better," said Jennifer Perez, another law student. "We are just as good [as higher tiered law schools]."

Despite being ranked relatively high the first time around, Spivak believes the College of Law could have been ranked better, but didn't because it is still a new law school. 

According to Strickman, the third tier ranking had more to do with the College of Law's performance than its age.

"We are as good as some second tier schools," Strickman said. "But we're not as good as the first tier schools, U.S. News is not the Bible."

With the high rankings the College of Law has received, Strickman hopes it will attract a new batch of law students. In regards to the idea that the College of Law's age is hindering its reputation, numbers may change everything.

"The rest of the world only knows what they read," Perez said. "[The high scores and tier ranking] helps generate a buzz."

Headline: Car thefts drastically increase over two-year period
Author: Christopher Necuze / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Sisters Catherine and Jillian Torres know all too well what it is like to be the victim of a car crime. 

They returned to their Gold Garage parking space March 6 only to find themselves stranded with their 2004 Toyota Tacoma missing. 

"We knew exactly where we were parked. This is what I ended up telling the police, later," Catherine said. "My sister had class from 12:30 to 1:45 p.m., she called me about five minutes later to ask where we had parked. I reminded her we were on the fifth floor of the Gold Garage. She told me that was where she had been looking. Once I went down there, we contacted Public Safety."

When compared, the numbers of vehicle thefts in 2005 and 2006 show a great disparity, and suggest that incidents like Catherine's may not be so isolated. 

According to the Uniform Crime Report and data provided by Public Safety, campus car crimes have increased a staggering 270 percent from 2005 to 2006.

In years past, car thefts have proven to be a particular problem for Public Safety. From 2004 to 2005, car thefts increased, while other crimes such as those against persons decreased across the board. 

Even then, the increase was from 14 thefts to 17, not nearly as robust an increase as 2006 saw, from 17 to 63.

Bill King, director of Public Safety, offers an explanation. King views the auto theft problem on campus as a reflection of the situation around the city.

"I guess the increase in thefts is not that different than some of the other increases of auto thefts around the area," King said. "I think if you look at the statistics of Miami and surrounding communities you will notice that there has been an increase in auto thefts."

But, according to the Miami-Dade Police Department Police Services Bureau, car theft has declined by 56 percent over the last 10 years. In fact, only 50 more car thefts were reported in 2006 than in 2005.

 Aside from vehicle thefts, vehicle burglary has also menaced Public Safety. 

There were 74 reported incidents in 2006, and 27 so far this year.

Gloria Acosta, an adjunct senior secretary for the English department, was lucky that her incident did not involve the shattering of glass.

"My hubcaps were stolen," Acosta said. "This happened maybe three weeks ago. My boyfriend found the car where we had left it, in the Gold garage. The hubcaps had been taken, the car looked like it had four spares."

Unlike Catherine, however, Acosta's first instinct was not to call Public Safety and file a report.

"We would have filed a report if it would have mattered to the insurance company," Acosta said. "Since they weren't going to cover them anyway, we figured it didn't matter to them and therefore it didn't matter to us. We just had to buy new hubcaps."

Acosta may not be alone. Students whose cars are damaged or broken into may not file a report if they feel that the damage is either not covered by their insurance company or is less than their deductible to repair. 

The number of cases of vehicle burglaries may actually be higher due to those incidents like Acosta's that remain unreported.

King thinks that situations like these are not unique to campus crimes.

"No matter what, we should get information about any kind of crime that occurs on campus," King said. "I think that there probably is some underreporting, probably in most crimes - not only at FIU and in the University community, but throughout society."

As Catherine and Jillian will attest, however, filing a report does not necessarily increase your chances of getting your car or stolen belongings back.

"The police officer did call me the following weekend," Jillian said. "He called to ask if we had found [the car]. He also asked for some information and I had to refer him to my dad … it's been more than a month now and we've still only received one call."

A single phone call may seem insignificant to someone who has just lost their car but, as King explains, most stolen vehicles do not remain on campus very long; they are quickly driven elsewhere, beyond the jurisdiction of FIU police.

"In a car theft, particularly here at FIU, if a car is taken, they are probably going to take the car away from FIU and there is not much more that can be done after the initial investigation where we check witnesses, possible video, etc.," King said. "Once the investigation is done here on campus, it's very difficult to do much more."

In response to the increase in car crime throughout campus, Public Safety has taken some initiatives in efforts to curb the pandemic.

"We have done a number of things from increasing some patrols in problematic areas," King said. "Some things we've done may not be apparent to the University community, and that may be anything from undercover surveillance and officers to having cameras in certain areas."

Though these initiatives may have failed in preventing her hubcaps from being stolen, Acosta appreciates that crimes which she says really matter, such as violent crimes, have been steadily declining.

"When it comes to campus security as a whole, they are pretty good about getting most of the crimes that count," Acosta said. "Even though there is a problem with cars, I much rather them prevent a rape than find a car, and they're pretty good with that stuff."

Headline: Students miss out on scholarship opportunities
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This year, sophomore Hector Nava will join hundreds of other FIU students who will enroll in courses not at University Park or Biscayne Bay Campus, but at universities around the world.

Nava, who came to FIU from Mexico just over one year ago, is a self-proclaimed traveler. He has chosen Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, as his next destination, and will take courses in industrial engineering during Fall 2007 as an exchange student.

Study abroad programs range in length from one week to an entire academic year, and are available in a number of varied countries such as Ecuador, Czech Republic and Japan - though the most popular destinations are Spain and Australia. Prices also vary, but Nava assures that the sticker price does not reflect the final cost.

"It's really not that expensive," Nava said. "I have to pay for housing and tuition at FIU anyway. It's just the airfare that's expensive, that's it."

For many other students cost does seem to be a deterrent, according to Christine Jarchow Sjoblom, director of the Office of International Studies. Sjoblom, who came to FIU three years ago from Virginia Tech, said that there is "significantly less" interest in international study at FIU than at her former institution.

"I think that is because FIU is a commuter campus, whereas Virginia Tech is a residential campus," Sjoblom said. "But what is strange to me is that although [FIU students] traditionally have fewer financial resources, they don't apply to scholarships."

Sjoblom, who is also the FIU coordinator for the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program and the Critical Need Language Supplement-both federal programs-said she is surprised each year at the small number of scholarship applications her office receives.

This year, Sjoblom only received one application for the Gilman scholarship. The scholarship, which grants awards up to $5,000, requires that applicants be U.S. citizens and Pell grant recipients. Sjoblom pointed out that there are "plenty" of eligible students at FIU.

The Critical Need Language Supplement awards an additional $3,000 to students studying Arabic, Chinese, Persian, or other languages chosen by the federal government. There were no applicants for this scholarship at FIU this year.

The Office of International Studies also offers a number of internal scholarships. One is the Edward Pascoe Study Abroad Scholarship, a private scholarship of up to $2,500 for students studying in Genoa, Italy. No one applied this year.

"The donor is not going to be happy when I tell him that we couldn't give the money away because there were no applicants," said Sjoblom. "This application only requires a 500-word essay. When else on earth are you going to be paid $5 a word to write a paragraph?"

Freshman Natalie Touzard, who is majoring in architecture, transferred last semester from the Dominican Republic and is interested in participating in the Art and Architecture program in Genoa next Fall semester.

The estimated program cost is $8,000, which includes housing, studio space, group travel, and some meals. Students must also pay FIU tuition and are responsible for airfare and personal expenses, which are estimated at $3,500.

"I would like to apply for scholarships but I [didn't] know that I could, [since] I'm not a U.S. citizen," Touzard said. "Thank God I have my parents to pay for it."

According to Sjoblom it's not too late to apply for summer programs and scholarships, and encouraged students with little international experience to follow in Nava and Touzard's footsteps. 

"FIU students are mostly from Miami, many of them live at home, and if they really want to see how the world functions outside of Miami, this is their opportunity. Many students tell me they don't need to study abroad because Miami already has a second language and is very international…but we're no Geneva, Shanghai, or London," she said. "If you want to be able to compete in the global market, you have to get out of Miami."







-Clarification from issue 10/29/07-
An article published in the News section April 19, 2007, quoted Natalie Touzard as saying she was not a U.S. citizen. Documents presented to The Beacon show that Touzard is a U.S. citizen.

The documentary is about a South Florida version of a bigfoot-like creature that makes its home in the Everglades. The group compiled 10 hours of footage that was then cut to a 15-minute film. 

Footprints can be viewed in its entirety at http://jmc.fiu.edu/studentwork.htm.



New physical therapy degree approved

The Board of Governors has approved the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree to be implemented Fall 2007.

Students will be able to obtain the degree through the Department of Physical Therapy and it is being specified for physical therapist clinicians.



Wine and Food Festival raises $1.4 million for FIU

The Food Network South Beach Wine & Food Festival raised over $1.4 million for the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management this year. The festival, sponsored by Food & Wine magazine, was a great success according to Lee Schrager, founder and director of the festival, he spoke highly of the FIU student volunteers at the event.

 "They provide tireless support for the four-day weekend off events while reaping indispensable real-world experience," Schrager said.

Planning for the 2008 Wine and Food Festival has already begun, the projected date for next year's festival is Feb. 21 through Feb. 24. For more information, call 1-877-762-3933 or visit www.sobewineandfoodfest.com. 



Health care now available for temporary employees, vendors 

Various health care companies will visit FIU after the University's Division of Human Resources negotiated health care plans for all University temporary employees, vendors and their dependents. Vista Health Plans, Preferred Medical Plan and Care Access Health Plan will visit University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus the second Wednesday of each month through the end of the year to answer questions regarding their respective health plans and to aid in the enrollment process. 

The next visit is scheduled May 9 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in GC 241 and WUC 245. For a complete schedule and more information, please visit www.fiu.edu/hr/HealthPlan.html.



Payroll transition in the works

Starting this summer, FIU employees will be able to view and update payroll deposit information, personal leave accrual, emergency contact information, home address and other personal information by using the Employee Self Service portal. The transition is set to take place  July 6 and is a direct cause of the Bureau of State Payrolls in Tallahassee no longer supporting the University's payroll process starting June 15.

Headline: Centerfielder has speed and drive thanks to family
Author: Claude Phanor / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The chants of  "Go D-Money, go D-Money, go D-Money, go!" can be heard from the Golden Panther dugout as her teammates encourage her when she is up to bat.

Every at-bat can either be a bunt single, a sacrifice bunt or a crushing hit into the outfield. 

Deomni Murray, the senior centerfielder for the women's softball team is having the most productive season in her four years at FIU.

"I have no clue how or where it started. All I can remember is that last season some of my teammates started calling me D-Money and so that's how it all began," Murray said.

Many of her teammates believe she is the fastest and quite possibly the most athletic player on the team. 

It comes to no surprise that coach Kim Gwydir calls upon Murray to bunt or place the ball down in play during games to get the offense going. 

For the past two seasons, she has cemented herself as the team's lead-off hitter and has been successful in that spot. 

She is tied for first this season in hitting streaks (nine games), a record she originally set last year with eight straight games, and is also first on the team with an ongoing hitting streak of four games as of April 16.  

A 2006 and 2007 Pre-Season All-Sunbelt Conference Team selection, Murray ranks first on the team in hits (44) and total plate appearances (161). 

She is second behind junior shortstop Monique White in on-base percentage (.363) and is tied with White and senior catcher Tabitha Embry for runs scored (22).

"I am a running hitter and my objective is to put the ball on the ground and run as fast as I can and hopefully make the defense make a mistake," Murray said.

Making mistakes is what the opposing team is doing when Murray is on base.

This season she has 23 stolen bases in only 26 attempts, placing her first on the team and third in the Sun Belt Conference. 

She said she is poised to make her final year at FIU her best thus far.

According to Murray, despite putting up major numbers on offense, her defense is where she feels she establishes herself.  

"On the field, my strength is defense. I feel like I am a really good defensive player. Not to be cocky or anything, but I think I am a better defensive player than an offensive player," Murray said. 

"If I am doing bad at the plate, I'll always expect to get the job done in the outfield. So every ball that is hit I expect to get it."

Best known for her strong arm and her numerous diving catches, Murray is ranked fourth on the team in fielding percentage (.985).

Murray's shouts of "I got it" can be heard on almost a regular basis each game.

This competitiveness displayed on the field is nothing new to the athletic Murray family.

 Murray grew up with three 







brothers two of whom are also athletes, Tavares, 25 and Antwon, 18.

Tavares and Antwon played football at Lakeland High School.

Anwon, who is one of the top-ranked cornerback prospects in the state, has already committed to Boise State University's football.

According to her mother, Donna, the family as a whole is very athletic and sports-oriented.

Donna said that sports gave the family an opportunity to spend a lot more time together as a family.

Murray credits the fact that playing sports with her brothers helped her develop her athletic ability. Perhaps she helped them as well.

Headline: Commentary: Closers' value measured by pressure situations, not dominance
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
His team is struggling on the road to hold on to a 3-2 lead in the bottom of the eighth. Just a few moments ago his team had a 3-1 lead.

And although that may not seem like much, it's a hell of a lot of breathing room in a baseball game. 

The relievers before him have left him with a mess to clean - runners on the corners with two outs and the opposing team's best two batters due up.

It's not even the ninth inning, but it's moments like these why closers are so valued.

It is fitting that Boston Red Sox closer Jonathan Papelbon recorded a five-out save in the aforementioned situation on Easter Sunday against the Texas Rangers, because a month ago it wouldn't have been him in that situation.

Last year, the 26-year-old Papelbon took baseball by storm recording 35 saves and 0.92 ERA in his rookie season in arguably the most pressure-packed baseball town in the country.

Because of that dominance he showed as a closer, Boston management wanted to have him pitch more innings as a starter.

Now, I bet they're glad they didn't make that change, because Papelbon was probably the only pitcher in their bullpen who could've gotten them out of that jam in Texas.

Now, take a look at the Florida Marlins. Their closer has blown two saves - one which gave the Washington Nationals one of their two wins this season. And that's not the worst part, just half of the story. He has a 14.73 ERA, has a WHIP of 4.36 (i.e. he allows over four hits and walks combined every inning he pitches) and opposing hitters are batting .526 off him.

With all that said, if you have a pitcher who can dominate in the ninth inning, do not try to make him a starter. Just don't. Trust me. Ask any team who doesn't have Mariano Rivera, B.J. Ryan, Francisco Rodriguez or Trevor Hoffman. 

And don't get confused, just because you rack up a lot of saves, doesn't mean you're a dominant closer. Remember, you can enter the ninth inning with up to a three-run lead and it's still a save opportunity.

So, hypothetically, if every save opportunity you get is with a three-run lead and you allow two runs every time you go out, you'll have a lot of saves but an 18.00 ERA. Now that's too dominant, is it?

A dominant closer is such a valuable commodity that teams are technically overpaying these guys.

Take, for example, the highest paid starting pitcher in Major League Baseball last season, Mike Mussina of the New York Yankees, who made a whopping $19 million.

The highest paid closers were Mussina's teammate Rivera and Billy Wagner of the New York Mets, who both made $10.5 million.

With simple math alone, and not factoring in any other stats, the Yankees paid Mussina a little over $98,000 for ever inning he pitched. Rivera, on the other hand, was paid $140,000 per inning.

And the Yankees will gladly do it, because the innings Rivera pitches as a whole are more important than those Mussina does. Well, and because they have the kind of money to do that, because they're the Yankees.

In other words, from a pure money standpoint, closers are worth more money than starters. 

You could point out the situation with John Smoltz a couple of years back, but he was a dominant starter to begin with and only converted to closer as rehab after a few years of injuries. He was going to thrive in any pitching situation you put him in once he was 100 percent healthy. Heck, the Atlanta Braves were very reluctant to move him from the bullpen anyway.

All in all, if a pitcher can dominate and is comfortable coming out to pitch in high pressure situations in high pressure cities - such as Boston or New York - just go with it MLB teams. 

The worst that can happen is that you end up with a Jonathon Papelbon or a Mariano Rivera and you'll be getting your money's worth.

Headline: Commentary: FIU athletic season saw drastic but vital changes
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It's almost over.

Not just the Spring semester, but the athletic year as well.

To no one's surprise, a lot of FIU's sports teams struggled, most notably the football team.

It's been a strange year for FIU sports, but there were a few pleasant surprises sprinkled in among the usual chaos and losing.

Former safety Nick Turnbull played in the Super Bowl for the Chicago Bears as a backup safety and special teams player, women's basketball coach Cindy Russo won her 600th game, swimmer Sara Giovannoni broke the school record in the 200-yard breastroke and  placed 18th in the same event at the NCAA swimming and Diving Championships and women's soccer coach of 22 years - Everton Edwards - was fired, founding football coach Don Strock was fired, Mario Cristobal was hired in his place and there was that little brawl that took place at the Orange Bowl on Oct. 14. 

Yes, this has been a whacky and crazy year for FIU sports, but it has also been a year in which a lot changes have been made.

At the helm at all of the changes being made is athletic director Pete Garcia, who was brought in to completely revamp and change the culture of FIU athletics. He has often referred to FIU as a  sleeping giant.

Granted, it's going to take a lot of work to get this giant to wake up, but it's possible because of the resources available to the athletic program. 

This summer will be the time for the athletics to get out of neutral and shift into drive. It will be the time to make critical moves paramount to the future successes.

Among one of the major changes that needs to take place is in the baseball program. 

Though Danny Price has been coach of the baseball program for the past 27 years, it's time for team to go in a new direction. 

It was never more evident after his team's loss to UM on April 11 when Price inserted relief pitcher Jorge Ramos, who hadn't pitched since March 16, against one of the best hitters in the country, Mark Sobolewski. These types of season defining games versus elite opponents, such as Miami, are what Garcia will refer back to when evaluating the baseball team.

Cristobal and new women's soccer coach Thomas Chestnutt were brought in to clean up the mess made by previous coaches and despite the few bright spots in Price's 20 plus years of service, he has recently made some questionable moves most likely frowned upon by the personnel like Garcia.

Lots of changes, both big and subtle, have already been made, but more have to and will be on the way.

The approval and construction of the new football stadium is already a good way to start improving the football program, but it cannot merely start and stop with just football. 

Athletic and training facilities need to improve for FIU to compete in the division one level and coaches need to start doing a better job of recruiting better players.

Coaches for other teams need the same amount of support the football team receives, and several coaches have proven they deserve to be improved. 

The football program hasn't proven they deserve to be invested in as the team recorded zero wins this past season. No other program this year has had as bad of a season comparable to the one the football team put together.

Danijela Tomic is the women's volleyball coach and she too wonders if the athletic program is going to neglect the rest of the programs because of the emphasis on improving the football team.

According to Tomic, she has been part of a low level program like the Univeristy of Little-Rock Arkansas and the higher tier programs like Louisiana State University; therefore, she understands the resources needed to take the volleyball program to the next level. She recognizes that FIU definitley has a recruiting advantage over many other schools.

Being in South Florida, FIU has a huge advantage because it's one of the only places in the country where sports can be played year-round. States up North do not have the luxury of  practicing outdoor sports in the middle of winter.

Everyone pays so much attention to the football program that no one really notices the success of other teams on campus.

The softball team swept the ranked No. 14 in the country and the tennis team has been ranked in the top 35 all year among division one tennis teams and they defeated various ranked opponents such as the University of South Florida while maintaining a ten-game winning streak.

Granted, FIU is not the athletic equivalent of the University of Miami or the Florida yet, but we do have some successful programs and potential.

It's time for students to take notice that FIU athletics is more than just football, basketball and baseball.

It's sad to see the lack of attendance at most athletic events, especially when there are good winning programs at FIU.

Students say they are looking for a reason to cheer when there's already something to cheer for right in front of them.

There's no reason why there should be any UM merchandise worn by FIU students.

Baseball



The Golden Panthers (18-20) split the series against Sun Belt Conference opponent Louisiana-Monroe (21-16) April 13-14 at University Park Stadium after the rubber match of the series was cancelled due to a Hurricane watch.

Three Golden Panthers hit home runs in game one of the series against Warhawks pitcher Bucky Chandler. Entering the game, Chandler was the Sun Belt Conference ERA leader. The FIU offensive onslaught featured the three, four and five spots combining to hit 8-for-12. Senior third baseman Bryan Pullin went 3-for-4 with a home run and three RBI.

Golden Panther starting pitcher Chris Allen allowed four earned runs through seven innings of work. Evan Ellison struck out four through two innings of work to close out the 9-5 victory.

The second game of the series was a familiar scene as the Golden Panthers lost their second ninth inning lead of the week. The Warhawks outlasted the Golden Panthers in 5-3 extra inning victory. Golden Panthers pitcher Jorge Ramos made his second appearance out of the bullpen and once again had trouble recording outs.

Reliever Evan Ellison was charged with the loss, but Ramos allowed Ellison's base runner to score the go ahead run in the top of the tenth. Starting pitcher Corey Polizzano's nine strikeout performance was for naught because Warhawks starting pitcher Keith Christensen was equally impressive, giving up one run through six innings. 



Softball



The women's softball team (17-29) was swept by Sun Belt Conference rival Middle Tennessee (22-22) in a doubleheader April 14 at home. 

Game one of the series resulted in little offensive production as the Golden Panthers were shutout 5-0. The Blue Devils' Shelby Stiner hit a three-run home run to cap off their scoring in the top of the third inning. 

In Game two of the series, Golden Panthers starting pitcher Penny Eastman pitched a complete game, but allowed five runs in the 5-3 loss. 

The Golden Panthers were poised to win heading into the top of the fourth leading 3-0. Eastman came out for the final inning of the game and the Blue Devils scored five runs in the top of the seventh.



Tennis



The only ranked athletic program at FIU, the women's tennis team (16-4), extended its winning streak to ten games against the University of South Florida (12-7). The 4-2 loss snapped a four-game winning streak for the Bulls. Only singles played because of the weather.

Paula Zabala began the day winning against No. 31 ranked Shadisha Robinson. This match was the first of three matches won in a row. The Bulls were down 3-0, but won the next two matches to close the gap by one with the final match left. FIU's Nikkita Fountain defeated Ici Rai in straight sets to clinch the 4-2 victory against the Bulls.

 

Track and Field



Track and field had six members receive NCAA qualifying marks. Junior Naim Yisrael ran a 58.3 in the 400-meter hurdles, breaking her own FIU record. 

Other qualifiers included India George, Joeane Jadotte, Maneka Maxwell, Jurlene Francis and Jerode Wims.

Headline: FIU athletics loses scholarships
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU will lose twelve scholarships due to inadequate graduation rates, the most lost by any Division 1 school.

This is based on results from the National Collegiate Athletic Association, known as NCAA, which released its Academic Progress Rates for the 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 academic years.

APR is calculated by giving points to each team based on the number of players in good academic standing and on the number of players who remain in the institution.

The minimum score a team can record without losing any scholarships is 925, which indicates that the team's athletes earned 92.5 percent of all possible points and that the team is on track to graduate 50 percent of its athletes. 

If a team scores less than 900, it cannot replace scholarships even if an academically ineligible player leaves the team.

This year, three FIU teams scored less than 900: baseball, football and basketball.
As a result, FIU will lose 9 scholarships in football, two in men's basketball and one in baseball. 

Baseball scored the worst, with 850, and was placed in the top 1st-10th percentile nationally, which means that 90 percent of Division 1 schools were better at graduating players. The basketball team scored 870 and the football team scored 889.

The NCAA currently has retrieved nine scholarships from FIU. The remaining three scholarships will be lost in the Fall Semester.

Headline: NFL drafts first FIU players
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
For the first time in FIU history, a Golden Panther football player was selected in the NFL draft.

Former linebacker/defensive end Antwan Barnes was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fourth round with the 134th pick overall, while former wide receiver Chandler Williams was selected in the seventh round of the draft with the 233rd pick by the Minnesota Vikings.  

Although Williams and Barnes are the first two Golden Panthers to be selected during the NFL draft, they are not the only Golden Panthers who may make NFL roster next year.

Former defensive back Chris Smith signed a free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles the day after the draft had ended. Also, former linebacker Keyonvis Bouie signed a free agent contract with the New Orleans Saints.

Barnes is the all-time FIU career leader in tackles for losses with 57 and sacks with 22. His performance at the NFL increased his draft stock by recording one of the fastest 40-yard dash times among linebackers.

Williams left FIU as the all-time leader in receptions with 203. He also set the single season school record with 67 catches. 

Smith played just 7 games last year due to his involvement in the infamous brawl against UM. In 2006 he recorded 62 tackles, but logged in 178 tackles, one sack and on interception in his career.

Bouie recorded 165 career solo tackles, 6 sacks, and 3 interceptions.

Former linebacker Alexander Bostic III has yet to receive a free agent deal.

&nbsp;
FIU men's soccer coach Karl Kremser will not return for his 28th year of service after announcing his retirement May 7.

Kremser began his collegiate coaching career at Davidson College three years prior to being named FIU's men's soccer coach in 1980.

His resume at FIU includes 324 wins, two Division II national championships and 24 winning seasons.

He is retiring with an overall 337-210-41 record, making him the 17th most victorious NCAA Division I men's soccer coach. Kremser was key player in moving FIU into the Atlantic Soccer Conference in 2000 and an
affiliate member of Conference USA in 2005.

The men's soccer team competed in the NCAA Tournament eight times since entering Division I play in 1987 and four of the last six seasons. Kremser led the team's

He received several coaching honors at FIU: Florida's Coach of the Year in 1980, Collegiate Coaches' South Region Coach in 1985, Trans America Athletic Coach of
the Year in 1991 and 1996 and ASC Coach of the Year in 2000 and 2004.

In addition to his coaching accolades, he also helped send 40 former players to the professional level, including former U.S. National team player Robin Fraser and current U.S. National team player Steve
Ralston.

According to athletic director Pete Garcia, assistant coach Munga Eketebi will be considered for the vacant coaching position.

A research associate at the institute, Eisenhauer will discuss the new report, which studied 2005 census data to show changes in the immigrant population and
workforce over the past five years in Florida.

Such findings show that, compared to those native to the U.S., recent immigrants to Florida are just as likely to have advanced degrees. The report also shows that immigrants are nearly as likely to have
Bachelor's degrees, and are more likely to be
entrepreneurs.

Headline: Student experiences class divide
Author: Joy Clahar / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The first few days of college are somewhat similar to the first day of kindergarten: almost everyone is wearing their best new outfits, checking out the new territory and meeting new people.

These days are experienced differently by people of varying ethnicity, gender and socioeconomic backgrounds.  The girl sitting next to you may have gotten her new clothes at Sack's or Macy's, Ross or a thrift store.  Your new territory may include a room in the University Park Towers.  Your neighbor may be commuting from a three-bedroom apartment he shares with his mother and four younger siblings.

On campus, there is increased sensitivity to issues like AIDS awareness, homosexuality, race relations and gender discrimination.  Economic disparity within the student body, however, is a real issue that can be just as divisive as any other.  

During my first semester at FIU, a few classmates and I who had arrived early took the time to chat and make friends.  These conversations tend to be insubstantial and forgettable, starting with a compliment and some simple commonality.  Such was the case with my neighbor and I - at least that's how it started.  It didn't matter than she was "white" and I was "black".  It ended when I told her that I didn't have a car.  Flabbergasted, she looked at me and asked, "Why?"  Perplexed, I looked at her and answered, "Because I can't afford it."  Although we lived in the same residence hall and saw each other many times in the following year, we never spoke again.

It's a shame that it takes these kinds of experiences to make one aware of the consequences of economic disparity, even within the so-called "middle class."  Even more disturbing is how much of an impact it can have on personal interactions. Diversity is supposed to be celebrated and embraced at FIU, but it seems we haven't even begun to scratch the surface.

The fact is, people begin to segregate themselves on the basis of social class in high school, sometimes even before.  The result is an embarrassing ignorance of American reality.  According to the US Census Bureau, the median household income in 2005 was $46,326.  There is so much variance between the Hollywood star and the homeless man on the street corner.  In some parts of the world, even he is enviable.

The important thing to remember is that differences in financial circumstances are as much about inherited attitudes as they are about the size of the allowance your parents are able to give you.  Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, said that the main difference between his biological father and his financial mentor was not in the income they got from their jobs.  His "poor Dad" would often say, "I can't afford it".  His "rich Dad" would say, "how can I afford it?"  

Like any mindset, these are not easily overcome. Of course there are some attitudes that a college student from any social class can have.  One is, "If I want it, I get it."  No matter what your parents can pay for now, in the long run, this will ruin your credit and make you poor.

Here's a challenge in diversity: the next time you meet someone of a very different social class, take the time to get to know them.  Try to understand where they are coming from.  You may be surprised to find that the bonds that connect us as humans go much deeper than the price of your cell phone.  

In the words of financial guru Suze Orman, "people first, then money, then things."

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Math department stands behind employment policy
Author: Julian Edward / Chairman, Department of Mathematics
&nbsp;
In the Opinion article on April 12 by Ben Badger, Mr. Badger cites the difficulties he had understanding the English of his math professor on the first day of class, and suggests that the math department  is not careful enough in the hiring of adjuncts.

Although I am sorry that Mr. Badger had a bad experience on his first day, I take issue with his contention. We carefully interview each one, and make a decision on whether or not to hire based on a number of criteria including one's English. During the semester we view each adjunct professor teaching his class,  we monitor any student complaint and we carefully read each student evaluation. The math department collects hand written student evaluations, which is more than most other departments do. Finally, we monitor each adjunct's exams to make sure the adjunct is covering the syllabus and maintaining standards.

Mr. Badger also seems to suggest, without offering much evidence, that the math department has many professors who can't communicate in English. If a student really feels that the professor is unable to communicate in English, the student should contact the math department either directly or via student evaluations. Students having trouble with their math classes are also encouraged to take advantages of the many support services offered by the department and the university as a whole. Those offered by the 

Math department can be found at the departmental webpage: http://w3.fiu.edu/math/.

In an ideal world,  every professor at FIU would speak perfect English. However, the majority of the math faculty at FIU (and most other American universities) come from other countries. Our department does the best it can given its resources, and I challenge Mr. Badger to find a big state university that does a better job than we do.

Headline: Editorial: Underfunded Public Safety  ill-equipped for emergencies
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In the wake of the shootings that took place Monday at Virginia Tech, much criticism has been levelled against that university's police department. Critics say if campus police had done more, acted more swiftly and taken more steps, less young men and women would have died that morning. 

The Beacon is in no position to pass judgment on Virginia Tech's police department. But it is our place to question whether our own FIU Police Department would be prepared to handle a similar emergency if it were to happen here.

Sad to say, the answer seems to be a terrifying "no."

Over the course of the past year, The Beacon has reported on the woeful deficiencies of FIU's Department of Public Safety, which includes the FIU Police Department. 

FIU's police department is underfunded, understaffed and ill-equipped. At any given time, there is a small handful of officers on duty to police a student population of nearly 38,000. What's worse, faulty radio equipment makes communication among officers difficult at best - and impossible at times. If officers were to ever need to work in tandem, say, in the event of a shooting rampage, coordination would be impossible. 

For all of this, there is a reasonable explanation. The shortage of manpower can be accounted for by a lack of adequate funding. The police department simply doesn't have the money to hire a full-fledged workforce. The faulty radios can be chalked up to a bad decision. It was time for public safety to replace the police department's aging radio system, and it had to choose one of three options for the upgrade. Aparently, it chose the wrong one, and it has been throwing money at external consultants to try and fix the problem ever since. 

What's inexcusable, though, is that FIU doesn't have a campus-wide emergency plan for a situation like what happened at Virginia Tech. Or rather, it does have a plan, except no one but a couple of people know about it. A day after the Virginia Tech incident, The Beacon met with several top FIU administrators to discuss how the university would handle a violent attack. None of them were able to answer the question. The most they were able to do was refer the reporter to the same, single person - Public Safety Chief Bill King. 

Amid the chaos of a mass shooting, all universitiy authorities should be prepared to work in tandem to secure the campus. There wold be no time or opportunity for each of them to wait for a cue from Bill King. If there was any lesson left to us by the tragic events at Virginia Tech, it's that we also need to be prepared. It's evident that FIU is not.	

That is unacceptable, and FIU administrators need to take immediate, concrete steps to fix it. Public Safety's budget needs to be revised so it can hire more police officers and give them radios that work. More importantly, everyone on campus - from the president to the incoming freshman class - should know how to handle an emergency at our university.

FIU officials held a groundbreaking ceremony at the FIU Football Stadium May 25 for the renovations that will take place through the next months at the stadium. Representatives from FIU and Odebrecht Construction Inc., the company in charge of the project, were present at the ceremony. 

Phase one of the three-phase-project will cost $31 million and will add 10,500 seats and other amenities to the stadium. These include 14 air-conditioned luxury suites, a wrap-around concourse with a full field view, 1,400 club seats, a video scoreboard and a stadium club. 

FIU officials said phase one of the stadium
renovations will be completed by the Golden Panthers' 2008 season home opener against South Florida. While construction takes place this year, all home games will be played at the Orange Bowl. 

"As fast as we can do things the right way, we're going to do them," said Athletic Director Pete Garcia. "We're going to go at a faster speed than people think at everything we're going to do."

Henry "Turtle" Thomas was officially announced as the new head coach of the FIU baseball team on June 14, 2007 at the University Park Stadium. Thomas brings with him 30 years of college coaching experience. He has also coached at Miami, Georgia Tech, Clemson, Arizona State and LSU.

Coach Thomas addressed the media for the first time as the Golden Panthers' new leader. He compared the team's potential to that of a "Sleeping Giant."

High on Thomas' list of goals is improving game attendance, having the team gain and maintain a GPA of 3.0 and to recruit heavily in South Florida.

Several players attended the press conference and saw their new coach dawn his first FIU baseball cap.

"I like the new coach and the way everything is going; he knows what he is doing," said junior right fielder Dephillip Mason.

Currently, Thomas is still an assistant coach for the Arizona St. and will be in their dugout this Saturday as they take on UC-Irvine in the first round of the college world series in Omaha, Nebraska. Coach Thomas' immediate plans for FIU involve increasing practice time and hiring a staff from a group of some 75 candidates he is tracking. Thomas brings 2 NCAA national championships in his career.
