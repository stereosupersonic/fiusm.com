Headline: FTAA brings conflict to Miami
Author: C. Joel Marino/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Conceived in a 1994 conference also held in Miami, the Free Trade Areas of the Americas has become both the most challenged and acclaimed economic issue of the decade. As a proposed trading alliance spanning the areas between northern Canada and Tierra del Fuego, the agreement seeks to join 34 nations (excluding Cuba) in a free trade market eliminating tariffs and non-tariff barriers between all members. The North American Free Trade Agreement, set into effect between 1994 and 1998, saw a similar treaty being signed between Canada, the United States, and Mexico.

Unlike any other trade agreement before it, the FTAA Summit will for the first time in history decide on a charter encompassing the regions of an entire hemisphere.

Due to the large coverage Miami has received for its part as host-city to the conference (and for the role it might play as future capital of the Free Trade Area), it's no wonder that both FIU and its students have taken roles in the giant issue.

"I've been following the [FTAA] story for a month, since I first read it in a newspaper," says sophomore Eric Pena. 

An info session sponsored by Students for Fair Trade, the Latin American and Caribbean Center and other school organizations updated many students on the current situation when it was held Nov. 17 at the Green Library.

Many faculty members have also taken time to educate their classes not only on the FTAA but also on its far-reaching implications. 

"I believe it's an issue all students should be aware of," said Latin American History professor Peter Stedman. "It's something that will eventually affect all of us."

Personal opinions regarding the trade market remain, not surprisingly, as  varied and differing as any issue among FIU's many students.

Matthew Troccoli, a third year finance major, favors the Free Trade Area. 

"This proposal will help eliminate trade barriers which I see as inhibiting the economy, creating greater relations between the United States and Latin American countries in the process; there is no reason why it shouldn't pass," Troccoli said. 

With Miami - along with Atlanta and Panama City - on the short list for being named secretariat of the FTAA, Troccoli sees the Summit dovetailing with his future career goals. 

"I plan to live here [in Miami] and I recognize the prestige this would bring to our city. I know that I'd be able to choose a job between more national and international companies, and that in itself is a major advantage for any college student."

Why, then, has the Summit aroused such massive protests, including those both for the Miami proceedings and for the 1998 Seattle summit infamous for its violent riots?

Mauricio de la Vega, an FIU senior who joined thousands of demonstrators along Biscayne Boulevard early Thursday, is sure he knows why. 

"Having read about the FTAA, I know that if it passes, we will lose regulations and laws that protect people like me, workers, and the environment. Labor laws are affected, environmental laws are affected; I see it as a binding contract that will supersede the Constitution, even transcending federal laws," de la Vega said.

Students like liberal studies major Michael Matthews and English major Valerie Silidker see their protests as a necessary and powerful force.

"I'm here to exercise my right to freedom of speech," said Matthews, parading alongside a group from the Animal Welfare Institute as they wind a corner surrounded by heavily armed policemen.

 "As with NAFTA, jobs will be taken from Americans and sent overseas. What people don't know is that this is going to hurt Americans economically, as well as bypass basically 30 years of environmental regulations."

Silidker, a demonstration leader for the Animal Welfare Institute, called the protests her "first priority against the FTAA monster."  

Despite media hype, Silidker is happy that the rallies mostly went without disturbances, mentioning the apparent solidarity between those involved, from students voicing their opinions, to teachers and union workers from all over the country.

"There are thousands of people out here, and for every one of them, there are at least 500 people out there who feel the same way, who are adamant, who are against the Free Trade of the Americas. That we are heard, and that we are heard right, is the most important thing at this moment," Silidker said.

Having planned to visit downtown all week, freshman and international business major Andrew Affel at first planned on just checking out the riots. Then he heard about the FTAA's potential impact on the world market.

"I know that we'll lose manufacturing jobs to poorer countries, and I do think that the decision to eliminate tariffs will hurt the economy in the short term," Affel said. "But if the FTAA comes to America and Miami is chosen as the center, I think it will create many jobs for thousands who need it."

Headline: BOT votes for med school
Author: Vanessa Gomez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"FIU School of Medicine." Do you  like the sound of that?  Well, it may not be long  before  FIU's M.D. graduates tend to us in hospitals and health care centers.

On Nov. 17, the university's Board of Trustees approved a plan to create  an Academic Health Center, which will include a doctorate in medicine program that could admit its first class as early as 2006.

 Once established, the M.D. degree program, in combination with the introduction of new health degrees, community hospitals and clinics,  and  with enhanced coordination of health programs, will lead to the new Academic Health Center. 

 This is a project almost seven years in the making.  FIU president Modesto A. Madique said, "This proposal is largely based on the fact that  all the building blocks of a great medical school are in place. We have Ph.D. programs in the basic sciences, in nursing and engineering. An M.D. is the next logical step."

As stated in the med school initiative concept paper, FIU's Academic Health Center  will "utilize existing community based resources to  avoid wasteful duplication and address critical community needs. 

"Community hospitals in Miami and leading  community health organizations will collaborate with FIU to focus on teaching and research on primary care issues- fundamental to the health of a large, multicultural urban community that has uneven access to health care"

The new AHC  promises to improve the quality of health care in Southeast  Florida by  "advancing biomedical and scientific knowledge through  research, scholarship, and direct application to the health care needs of South Florida, the state, the nation, and the wider region served by FIU."

It will also better health care by  "creating affordable, accessible medical school in Southeast Florida that directly partners with community hospitals and health care clinics throughout the region," it will provide alternate healthcare access for our diverse population, and it will  "increase the number of  culturally sensitive  under-represented minority physicians serving our area."

Even though the proposal was approved by the university Board of Trustees, Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of academic Affairs said, "The final authorization for this project will come from the Florida Board of Governors, and needs to be funded in the State Legislature before the final authorization."

The med school  initiative  will require two additional  health and medical education  buildings. 

A third facility that would serve as a medical sciences building is scheduled for completion  by 2006. 

Rosenberg stated that the exact location for these building has not yet been determined, but will probably be somewhere in the northeast part of University Park.  

If in the future there is a decision made to build a clinic, it will probably be  at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

The cost of all three buildings sum up to an estimated  $125 million. 

Funding for these buildings will come mainly from state Public Education Capital Outlay  funds, private funding, state matching funds and federal grants. 

Over the next decade, a new Medical Sciences, Biomedical, and Biotechnology Research Laboratory building are also scheduled for construction. 

This facility will mainly be funded with state dollars, private donations, contracts and grants. 

It will have the capacity to generate approximately  $26 million a year.

In total, FIU's Medical Health Initiative, including the AHC, will generate nearly a quarter of a billion dollars for the Southeast Florida economy by 2010. 

By the year 2020, the intiative will generate more than three quarters of a billion dollars.

According to Rosenberg,  the  med school tuition will be compatible to other  graduate state school  programs. 

It will also generate a considerable amount of profit that will no doubt benefit the southeast Florida community.

"If we blink we may not  get another opportunity," said Board of Trustees Chair Adolfo Enriques. "The compelling case is made in the data that we absolutely need a public medical school in this community and the resources for that education to take place."

The Board of Trustees hopes that the AHC will not only benefit students, but the rest of the community as well.

Freshman communications major Linda Gomez agrees, "It will bring a lot more people to the school, and better our community."

Headline: Fee to facilitate division 1-A jump
Author: Vanessa Gomez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Just last week the Athletic Department  and the university fee committee convened meetings in both campuses to inquire into student's feelings towards the proposed athletic fee increase. 

The purpose of the increase  request was to raise funding for the  university's football program. According to Athletic Director Rick Mello, there are changes taking place in collegiate football that  make it imperative that they act now.

 Conference re-alignment and changes in NCAA regulations have accelerated  FIU's plans to enter division 1-A.  The extra funding will  allow the football program to make the transition.

After careful consideration on Nov. 19, the fee committee approved the increase for the amount of $1.21 per credit hour, but not without a few changes and recommendations.

Before deciding on the matter, the Student Government Council polled 480 students to find out what they thought about the increase, and  inquire about their concerns.

"For the most part," said Clayton Solomon, University Park Student Government Council president, "students wanted to know: Can we win? What about soccer and what exactly is going to happen with the money?"

As explained in the original  proposal, in its first year, the fee increase will generate $785,000. 

From this amount $750,000 was to be granted to the football scholarship fund and the remaining $35,000 went to operational costs. 

Now approved, this will no longer be the case. Instead of the $35,000 going to operational costs, the monies  will be granted to the Student Football Committee. "That is my way of making sure the money stays with the students," said  Solomon.

According to Athletics Director, Rick Mello, with the increase the football program will be able to offer more scholarships.

Business student Jason Sanchez said, "I just hope that we get a good team, and start winning some games with this money."

Most students are not happy about the increase but optimistic about a winning team. 

 Freshman Maria Bounassar  said, "It sucks [that] we have to pay more, but if we play better teams like UF and FSU, it will be worth it." 

Students had also expressed a concern for the Men's Soccer program. There was a recommendation made  that "the university try to maintain diversity of sports-including men's soccer," said Solomon. "We expressed how important that is to us."

The university's Board of Trustees  will vote on the fee January of next year, and if the increase passes, it will take effect in the fall 2004.

Headline: FIU's Gulf Stream magazine reaches local, national audience audience
Author: Gosia Darwin/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A small office in the English department on Biscayne Bay Campus is filled with colorful booklets tightly aligned on shelves. Each color represents a different back issue of FIU's own literary magazine. 	

Gulf Stream is a biannual publication of the Creative Writing Program, which for 14 years has been reaching readers locally and around the country. 

"It's for people who are interested in contemporary poetry and fiction, who want to see what new writers are doing," said Diane Mooney, the associate editor of Gulf Stream and a graduate student in the Creative Writing Program.

Mooney, who started working for the magazine this fall, is also the editor of its 20th issue, titled New Voices from Miami. Funded by a $3,000 grant from Miami's Cultural Affairs Department, it is a special issue, entirely devoted to local writers. Some of the 18 contributors include well-regarded local authors such as Laura Valeri, Emma Trelles, Mia Leonin and Kathie Klarreich.

Mooney believes that there's a big misconception about Miami and that its vibrant literary community should contribute to changing that image. 

"People think Miami is all about South Beach, models and movie stars. But there are really good writers and great bookstores here," Mooney said.  

Professor Lynne Barrett, one of the faculty members at the Creative Writing Program, founded the magazine in 1989. 

"I chose the name Gulf Stream because the ocean current of the same name comes through here and then moves onward, carrying our warmth into colder places," Barrett said. 

She saw it as a way to teach the graduate students about editing and publishing and as a means to get word of the program out into the world. The publication is managed and edited by the program's graduate students and professor John Dufresne. 

Regular issues of Gulf Stream print mostly new, unpublished writers who submit their work to the editorial board for review. 

"We look for well-plotted and well-crafted stories that stand out," Dufresne said. "Something we haven't seen before."

The magazine comes out in spring and in fall, with 1,000 copies of a half letter- size booklet, about 100 pages thick, with a cover that usually features an artistic black-and-white photograph. 

Gulf Stream is currently looking for candidates to design the cover of the upcoming Spring 2004 issue. 

The editors are responsible for raising money. They rely on donations, subscriptions and sales. Gulf Stream is funded in part through an endowment given in memory of Stanley Barnett. A single issue of the magazine costs $8, and the annual subscription is $15. The magazine has about 450 subscribers, Mooney said. About 300 more copies are sold or distributed. Many go to English teachers at FIU. 

"The reach of the magazine is definitely national," Mooney said. 

University libraries across the country, among them University of Wisconsin and University of North Carolina, subscribe to Gulf Stream. 

During the recent Miami Book Fair in early November, the magazine had its own booth and a well-attended panel presentation. 

There are also readings from the special issue scheduled at Nova Southeastern University on Jan. 16, and in a Books & Books store (arrangements for the location and time are being made). 

Besides the magazine, there is also an e-zine, an online sister publication updated twice a year. Gulfstreem!ng is different from the printed magazine, although it is managed by the same team. 

Dufresne and Cindy Chinelly, an editor and graduate student, choose most of the material. In addition to literature, Gulfstream!ng features interviews, photography, audio files, and more. Gulf Stream has announced a writing contest open to previously unpublished writers of fiction and poetry. 

The winners will receive money awards, $500 for fiction and $250 for poetry, and they will be published in Gulf Stream. The deadline for submissions is Feb. 1, 2004. 

For more information, call the office of the Creative Writing Program at 305-919-5599. The information about the magazine, as well as the link to Gulfstream!ng can be accessed through the program's website at http://w3.fiu.edu/crwriting/

Headline: Solomon elected to head FSA
Author: Maria Merzeau/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Just last week, Clayton Solomon, University Park Student Government Council president, was elected chairman of the Florida Student Association. His new position will allow better student and FIU representation on a state level.

Solomon ran against four other Student Government Association presidents: Ancel Pratt from Florida Atlantic University, Brian Battles from University of Central Florida, Jerry Watterson from University of North Florida, and Oman Khan from University of South Florida. The election took place in the Graham Center room 150, where eight other SGA presidents from across the state voted for their choice of four candidates. The race was close, but Solomon came out on top with a 6 to 4 vote over FAU's Ancel Pratt.

"This is the first time that an FIU student government president has been elected chairman of FSA," Justin Fahringer, Governmental Elections Council of the Florida Student Association, said.

The FSA has has over 240,000 student members, and its job is to represent and advocate for student concerns of the Florida public state universities at a state level.

"By being the Chairman of FSA, he would be able to give FIU a voice in Tallahassee," said Fahringer.

Solomon's FSA agenda includes plans to address issues such as the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program, tuition increases and funding for different universities. The FIU student body will also benefit from Solomon's new title, given that per Florida state statute, the FSA president is automatically granted a seat on the Board of Governors. 

The Board of Governors consists of 17 members, 14 of whom are appointed by the governor. In addition, the Board of Governors automatically includes the Commissioner of   Education, the chair of the Advisory Council of Faculty Senates and the president of the Florida Student Association.                                                                                                   

In the near future, the Board of Governors will be considering projects such as the FIU medical school initiative and the proposed athletic fee increase.                                                             Solomon will start his term as FSA chairman and Board of Governors member in January of next year. He will serve his positions until the end of the spring semester.                                                 

"It is good for FIU that we are represented as the chairman of the FSA and also on the Board of Governors," Solomon said.                                                                                                         

Solomon is scheduled to attend a meeting in Tallahassee with Gov. Jeb Bush on Dec. 9 to discuss current student concerns. Solomon's duties will also include communicating with Scott Ross, the executive director of the FSA, in order to get acquainted with the issues and the FSA lobbying efforts.

"I'm very honored to be representing so many students and their issues, my main job is to serve the students of Florida as a whole," Solomon said."All decisions I make are going to be in the better interest of all the students of Florida."

Headline: FTAA legislation puts citizens' civil rights at risk
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As the crowds clear in downtown, the Free Trade Area protests ended without major incident.  But what many politicians are calling a success is a failure for Miami-area residents; To woo the FTAA into making Miami its home, officials spent $16.5 million over the weekend on police security alone, locking down the downtown area, and enacting dangerous - and downright stupid - legislation that has breached the rights of ordinary citizens for years to come and transformed Miami into a police state.

The legislation was tailor-made for the FTAA protests, but because laws cannot be created to affect just a particular protest - that would be a first-amendment violation - residents will have to live with the rules until some politician has the sense to repeal it.  

It includes such wonderful enigmas and generalities as: an "'assembly' shall mean any ... group of three (3) or more persons, animals, or vehicles, or a combination thereof," and "[it shall] prohibit the possession of materials or devices that can be thrown or projected." It specifically outlaws water balloons and marbles, as though to underscore the bully-ish mentality of its intent. A group of three (3) or more persons, animals or vehicles - or any combination thereof - possessing a water balloon, depending on a police officer's whim, can now be arrested.

The more-than-2,500 police that descended on the downtown area were quick to pat themselves on the back for having "controlled" the situation, though it is clear that a lower than expected turn out and well behaved crowd were largely responsible for the peace.

The frantic paranoia that lead to the legislation is exemplified in a statement by current Miami Police Chief John Timoney - who pushed for its passing - and directly contradicted by former Miami Police Chief Kenneth Harms, with a hyperbolic Timoney sounding much like the feverish sensationalism that poured from local news outlets.

"These are outsiders coming in to terrorize and vandalize our city," Timoney told The Miami Herald.

"The vast majority of the demonstrators were just ordinary folks," Harms, perhaps more accurately, said. 

Roughly 230 out of an estimated 10,000 protestors were arrested, and many have had their charges dropped. If city officials had any sense, they would confess to having made a mistake, and repeal this asinine legislation.

&nbsp;
America mourns Jonathan Brandis. 

Well, maybe not mourn. Mourn is a strong word. We are saddened.

OK, saddened won't do. Concerned? Bemused? Is that really so horrible?

Brandis, for those who missed his wealth of adolescent work, was the miniature pre-heartthrob in such classic flicks as "Ladybugs," "Sidekicks," and "The Never Ending Story 2." Think of a not-so-monstrously-cute Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

Oh, wait. You don't remember Jonathan Taylor Thomas? He was Zachary Ty Brian's mischievous foil for most of "Home Improvement'"s run.

What? Zachary Ty! Has he, alas, also fallen into the voracious black hole of anonymity? 

It's been a sad few weeks in celebrity news. Brandis, of course, allegedly offed himself at the premature age of 27, positively truncating countless appearances on E! and VH1. 

The Paris Hilton videos, (and yes, there are as many of those lying around as there are green apples in God's fields) have pushed the socialite to the top of the increasingly large list of millionaire whores. 

There's Michael Jackson's imbroglio. There's nothing to be said about that. Michael is America's grandest creation, a post-apocalyptic entity, half man half woman, half black half white, half child half mummy, a genial madman whose greatest feat is being completely unaware of how incredibly freakish he appears when placed in front of a camera lens. 

(In related news, a Santa Barbara reporter died of a heart attack while covering Jackson's arrest. Stress? Heat? Accidental exposure to Michael Jackson's horrifying visage? You be the judge.)

And of course, there's Pauly Shore's unfortunate death at the hands of a trained Liberian baboon during the shooting of his upcoming remake of "Monkey Business," the classic comedy that launched Ronald Reagan to fame. Shore's bids at a political career as a Republican senator came to naught.

That last one didn't happen. Yet.

I do have a point. Well, I obviously don't have one, but we will all pretend I am about to arrive at some greater truth about the fleeting footsteps of fame. 

We can do that as a nation. We've done sillier things. 

We've elected Arnold, and George W., and we will, eventually, elect Pauly Shore. 

Fame, in the words of John Lennon (or David Bowie, depending who you ask), gets you there where things are hollow. 

When it goes, it goes the way your husband or wife of twenty years will inevitably leave you; it storms out of the door and leaves you there, wondering why the hell she took the kids and the car.

 Of course you do what Jonathan Brandis did, or what so many other worthies and not so worthies have done: you find a steady beam somewhere above you, and make sure it can support your weight as you kick and spasm your way into the great oblivious hole of Death.

Or you star in your amateur porn video. Or on a very special episode of "Where Do Ex-Celebrities Go After They've Fallen So Low the Bouncers At the Club Laugh In Their Faces?" It's fun at the bottom of the barrel. It's all good.

After all, it might just make Fame turn its head, however briefly, in a mournful backwards glance.

Headline: Protest message gets clouded in tear gas waves
Author: John Colagrande Jr./Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Once again the national spotlight fell on Miami. 

Did Miami represent? Was all that police force necessary?

You can't tell me those protesters were violent. You can't. Those kids were hippies, if anything they would like to live on a farm, grow their own food, and share. They were not anarchists, not that I saw. 

I was down there. 

I got capped with a rubber bullet for standing in the street. 

The police were so prepared for violence, so amped up, so overstaffed that they in fact resulted in the means to violence. 

I saw the police overreacting like crazy. 

If you were watching on television and paying attention to the images and not the talking heads - then what you saw was hundreds of Miami policeman pushing a few protestors backwards while nothing but cameramen and reporters milled around looking for images to sell. 

That's what I saw from the scene.

Live from downtown Miami. We're coming live from downtown Miami. We're here live outside the FTAA gathering where thousands of... 

Who says we have to believe what we hear on television or read in the newspapers? We have a right to our own opinions, whether we are in the minority or not. The media, in general, has an agenda of its own. 

It is very important to see through the crap that is thrown our way. The FTAA protests were not as violent as they were portrayed. 

The FTAA protest story was scripted before the Free Trade talks even began - the event garnered the attention of the national media and the media were not going to come to Miami for nothing. 

Do you understand that? Is that point clear? The media came to Miami to cover a violent protest story - which was the angle they wanted. Why? Violence and fear sells, why else? 

Also, in that spin, the message of the protest got clouded in a wave of tear gas: American jobs are being lost to corporate greed. 

Here's an example, as I understand it, of what is beginning to happen to our brand of capitalism. 

Corporation X sells Gizmo 1. Gizmo 1 costs Corporation X $10 to make in America. In America they have to pay higher salaries and benefits to its employers. They sell Gizmo 1 for $100. We consume. 

Corporation X now decides to go to China or Peru to make Gizmo 1 because it only costs them $1 to make. The salaries are cheaper in Peru and China and Corporation X doesn't have to pay benefits to its employers. 

Corporation X fires their American employees. They still sell Gizmo 1 for $100. We still consume. 

If Corporation X sold Gizmo 1 for $10 then maybe we would have a silver lining out of losing American jobs. No? 

One last point. The violation of civil liberties perpetuated by the Miami police department and enforced by the Miami judicial system cannot be ignored. 

The Sun-Sentinel reported example after example of FTAA protestors arrested for little cause then held on high bonds so they would have to stay in jail. 

Sounds like a police state. But, then again, these were violent anarchists. 

It was for our own protection.

Fee Increase decided by Fee Committee, not Athletics 



To the Editor:



The story on the front page of the Nov. 18, 2003 issue of The Beacon written by Vanessa Gomez was a comprehensive analysis of the facts surrounding the proposed increase in the Athletic fee. 

However, as Chairperson of the Fee Committee, I feel compelled to point out a significant piece of information that needs to be corrected. 

The event described in the article was in fact a public hearing scheduled and arranged by the Fee Committee for the purpose of receiving feedback from the student body regarding the proposed increase. 

It clearly was not a meeting convened by the Athletic Department for the purpose of promoting their requested fee increase, as was reported. 

The Athletic Director did make a presentation and was available for questions and answers, but it was the Fee Committee that scheduled and convened the hearing and the committee members eligible to vote were present to hear the feedback from students. Thank you in advance for printing this clarification.

Charles L. Tinder,

Associate Vice President for Budget & Planning 



Article response: 911



To the Editor:



This is in response to Nicole Smith's column "Emergency? Call... what was the number?"

My name is Nardia Dixon and I, too, live in the University Park Towers.  

When I moved in, I received a small blue sheet of paper with my room number, mailbox number, phone number, address, the name of my Resident Assistant and the location of my R.A.'s room.  

The note went on to explain how to make calls on and off campus. At the very end of the note were three numbers: the University Park Towers front desk, the Primary Beeper and the Emergency Number: 5-911.  

Any of these numbers could have been used in case of any emergency.  Every resident is issued one of these blue sheets. It is your responsibility to read it. You apparently did not. 

That was your mistake.  

We also received a housing packet. In it was a flyer on grease fires.  

Along with all the other contact information, was the number for the FIU Public Safety 5-911.  I guess you didn't read that one either. You really should have read the welcome packet.  The Department of Housing doesn't put it together because they want to kill trees. 

Furthermore, there were flyers displaying the emergency number posted throughout our building.  Maybe you missed them.  To be fair, there are many flyers to read through. 

It's a shame that you had an incident with your roommate earlier this semester and I am glad that it turned out well. 

However, the experience of needing to call for help and not knowing the number should have impressed upon you the importance of finding it out for yourself. 

It did not because there you were in another situation where you wanted to call for help and you couldn't.  

This was purely your fault.  

The school has a duty to provide safe living facilities for us, but it is your duty to know the procedures and protect yourself.

Headline: FIU blows lead, drops finale to FAU
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The story for FIU was the same as every other game this season against ranked opponents. Florida Atlantic University came into town ranked 14th nationally and in hopes of a victory to qualify for a playoff spot. FIU was pulling for a spoiler leading 23-21 early in the fourth quarter until a costly turnover on a reverse play was returned for a touchdown ending FIU's final game with a 32-23 loss to rival FAU at FIU Community Stadium on Nov. 22.

"We had the opportunities to make plays, and we didn't make them. It's really been the story of our season basically," said head coach Don Strock. "We made mistakes that cost us, we ran the reverse and fumbled it and it was the same reverse we fumbled in the Louisiana game."

FIU came out strong in the first half, led by halfback Adam Gorman who scored a pair of touchdowns early in the game. Kicker Adam Moss added a 38-yard field goal with 14 minutes to go in the first half to put FIU up 17-0. But things went spiraling downhill from that point.

FAU followed FIU's 17-0 run with 21 unanswered points. Owls' coach Howard Schnellenberger pulled a few tricks from his playbook when halfback Daveon Barron threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Matt Prudenti. Starting tailback Doug Parker scored on the next possession followed by a touchdown reception by Anthony Crissinger-Hill for the Owls' next score. The duo of quarterback Jared Allen and Crissinger-Hill led FAU. Allen threw for 281 yards and Crissinger-Hill had nine catches for 92 yards.

The youth of the team and inexperience was evident in FIU's final game, but Strock refused to use it as an excuse.

"There are no excuses. We are not quite there yet; it was a very competitive football game and turnovers can decide a football game and we did not win that battle," said Strock, who credited FAU for making the p;ays when they had to.

FIU came into the game as underdogs but played good enough to beat the Owls, but just couldn't hang onto the lead.  Schnellenberger noticed the improvement of FIU.

"What a wonderful game Strock and his Golden Panthers played tonight. They played us as well as anybody we have played all season. They were much better than I and the team expected," said Schnellenberger.

Gorman once again had a strong outing for FIU was he rushed for 93 yards and also had five catches for 28 yards.

"They ran a similar defense to the one of Troy State and we were just able to get some plays," said Gorman, who said he thinks the experience will help FIU in the future to close out games.

Running backs coach Tony Nathan is happy with the performance of Gorman, who was listed at the beginning of the season as No. 3 on the depth chart.

"I got to give it to him because he gave everything he had, every ounce of it. He just had a great year," said Nathan.

The schedule was tough for FIU, which had to face many ranked and talented football teams on the road.

"We had no illusions going into the season with a tough schedule on the road against some very competitive teams. We held our own in a lot of those situations. "I am proud of these guys because they played hard, but do they play smart all the time? No," said Strock of his team, which will enter its third year next season.

Even though lack of protection  was a key factor toward FAU's victory, Padrick credited his linemen's play. 

"The entire first half I had great protection. The protection began to fall towards the end of the game, but the line played a great game and had a great season," said Padrick, who said he thinks another year in the weight room will significantly help this team.

Safety John Haritan was disappointed with the heart-breaking loss.

"It's a really tough loss because we prepared really hard for it. We thought we had a shot and we did, but just let it slip away," said Haritan.

But Athletic Director Rick Mello believes the team should be proud.

"I am very pleased with the team. I know that nobody likes our record at 2-10, but when you look at the competitiveness of the program, we are very pleased with the progress we have made. We had the fourth toughest schedule in the nation and I'm glad we did that because it helps these kids," said Mello, who said that FIU is ready and prepared financially if asked to join the Sun Belt Conference next season.

FIU plans to make a jump to Division 1A, but won't find out until January if it will be approved.

Strock and his staff will now face another season; recruitment time, which Strock said will begin Monday.

Headline: Men's soccer defeats UCF to advance to second round
Author: Nasser Khalil/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers overcame early nerves and a tough, familiar opponent in UCF to defeat the Golden Knights, 3-1, and advance to the second round of the NCAA Tournament in front of 492 fans at the FIU Soccer Complex on Nov. 21.

With FIU and UCF facing each other for the second time in less than three weeks, it wasn't surprising to witness a tense, scoreless first half.

In the early going, FIU mustered several scoring opportunities, with the most notable coming in the ninth minute when playmaker Lucas Scudeler's cross found central midfielder Bobby Boswell, who shot wide of the net. A couple of well-hit long passes from right-midfielder Oscar Gil briefly ignited attacks in the opening minutes, but both times the plays fizzled before possibly turning into serious scoring threats.

The Golden Knights almost caught the Golden Panther defense napping in the 13th minute when midfielder Eric Vasquez, who caused most of FIU's headaches in the opening stanza, found some space on the right side behind the defense. 

Vasquez's accurately struck cross found fellow Miami native Juan Pablo Giraudo, whose glancing header skipped past the post. Giraudo could have executed better on the play, but FIU was happy to dodge the early bullet.

"I think our kids were ready, but we were a little nervous - a little slow in getting where we were supposed to be, not marking right away, a little tentative, you know," said head coach Karl Kremser. "We were fortunate they did not score [in the first half]."

Boswell had FIU's best scoring chance of the first half in the 25th minute when he broke free on a one-on-one to the left of the goalkeeper, but his shot was saved by UCF goalkeeper Ryan McIntosh.

One minute later, UCF's most consistent threat of the night, Vasquez, sent a cross off a free kick to Giraudo, who once again misfired with the header, this time over the top of the goal.

FIU nearly responded with an improbable goal just two minutes later when freshman defender Eythor Einarsson's wayward cross hit the post.

The Golden Panthers electrified their crowd for the first time in the 34th minute when substitute Jared Rose controlled a cleared ball nicely and sent a bouncing ball to right defender Allen Handy, who somehow found himself at the left-wing position. Handy expertly took the pass on the half-volley and whistled the shot just shy of the upper-right corner of the goal, sending the game scoreless into the half.

"It would have been sweet if I made that. I just wish the ball had a little more air in it," Handy said.

Handy got another chance early in the second half and made sure to covert on this one, as he took a pass from forward Carron Williams and beat McIntosh with a header to the left side in the 47th minute to give FIU a 1-0 lead. 

"I made a run out of the back and Carron played a perfect ball and I just ran and headed it in," Handy said.

Just 11 minutes later, the Golden Panthers added to their lead on a successful corner kick conversion. Rose's corner kick found Handy, who headed the ball across the goal line, where Boswell finished it off with a header of his own to make the score 2-0.

Handy, who was dangerous coming out of the back all game long, slipped a perfect pass on a counter attack to Einarsson, who blasted a shot past McIntosh from about five yards outside the penalty area to give FIU a comfortable three-goal advantage.

Said Handy of the assist: "I love attacking from the back. You know, defenders don't get to attack that much. As long as I get back the coaches let me [attack] as much as I want to."

FIU goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg's shutout bid was spoiled in the 69th minute when sophomore Jon Imran's headed in a corner kick from Vasquez to cut the lead to 3-1.

But the one goal was not enough, as Rosenberg (five saves) and the Golden Panthers held on to preserve the lead and sent UCF home for the winter.

FIU will next host Cal-State Northridge on Wednesday at 7 p.m. The winner of the contest advances to play UCLA in the third round of the postseason.

"Now we got a tough game on Wednesday, but the great thing is Cal State Northridge did not put in a bid to host the game, so now they have to play here, which is fantastic," Kremser said.

Because FIU did enter a bid to host the game, they will get to stay home instead of travelling to California, a place they have struggled at in the past.

Headline: Turnovers cost men's basketball in opening night loss
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After a 2-0 preseason, the Golden Panthers could not overcome 18 turnovers in the season opener as they were defeated by Howard, 67-55 at the Golden Panther Arena on Nov. 21.

Newly acquired point guard Marcus Robinson dominated the first half by going 5-of-9 from the field and hit a key three pointer right before the half as FIU took a 32-30 lead into the intermission. But Robinson struggled in the second half, hitting only one of his last seven field goal attempts, finishing the game 6-of-16 from the field (19 points), while being hampered by cramps in the second half.

 "I was cramping pretty much the whole second half. I have had a problem with that in the past because I sweat so much that I may not drink enough water so I just get many cramps," said Robinson.

Early on in the game, Robinson and Bison guard Louis Ford controlled the ball most of the time, driving the ball past each other numerous times in what seemed like a game of one-on-one. This theme was evident much of the game as FIU players took numerous erratic shots and set up isolation drives to the hoop, angering head coach Donnie Marsh.

 "I thought we got a little selfish. I think our guys kept looking at it as if, 'OK, it's my turn. I didn't get the ball last time, so now its my turn - type of game. At that point, I think our team got selfish," said Marsh. 

According to Marsh, much of FIU's troubles were a direct result of Ford's ability to mix up the FIU defense.

"I thought Ford was a key for them because our players got so caught up in [what he was doing], that it took them out of the game and what you're supposed to do for your squad," added Marsh.

Howard opened up the second half on a 17-7 run due to FIU's poor shot selection. After shooting light out (54.5 percent) in the first half, the Golden Panthers shot an awful 21.4 percent in the second half.

"I thought we were forcing a lot of shots. We were taking some things that were contested as opposed to making an extra pass and a lot of good things happen when you let the post men touch the ball, and we didn't let them do that," said Marsh. Marsh also blamed his team's struggles on too many perimeter shots.

But FIU looked very undisciplined in the second half and let the game get out of control as a result.

"We were up at halftime, but just came out and lost our focus and all concept of the game," said forward Harry Lum.

Besides the 18 turnovers, FIU players combined for only five assists in the game.

"It's time for guys to start to value the basketball, and I don't think we did that tonight. We have to press on our guys how significant it is to take care of the basketball," said Marsh.

With FIU down 47-39, Junior Matias closed the gap with a triple. Forward Harry Lum followed with a layup with 8:39 left to put FIU down by only three, 47-44. But that was as close as the Golden Panthers would get.

Down three, Robinson began to cramp up and had to take a sit on the bench for the first time during in the game. 

Howard widened their lead on a pair of field goals and never looked back again. Howard forward Seye Aluko led all scorers with 20 points on 6-of-10 shooting. Ford led Howard with four assists and 11 points. This was the first of two games that Taurance Johnson had to sit out due to an NCAA suspension. Not having Johnson's presence hurt FIU.

"We had no presence inside - that's for sure - but it wasn't about who was not here, but about who was," said Marsh, referring to the absences of Taurance Johnson and Carlos Morban, who both missed the game due to an NCAA suspension.

Without Johnson, arguably FIU's best post player, the Golden Panthers were forced to crash the boards with a smaller lineup.

"TJ is a big piece of our team and anytime you go out without your big best man it's going to hurt. We have to face reality because there are going to be teams when we will me missing people and we are just going to have to play our best," said Matias.

"We definitely needed him down low, he is a very effective player, he would have definitely helped us," said Lum, who finished with 11 points.

Forward Warren Gale replaced Johnson in the starting lineup and grabbed seven rebounds in 28 minutes to lead FIU. Matias scored 14 points, but was unhappy with the end result of the game.

"Coach said we need to become a team. Right now we are a bunch of individuals who want to score. We have to [get] that point across [in our minds] because until we do, we are going to keep losing," said Matias.

Subheadline: Point guard Robinson ready to improve men's basketball's scoring output
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Drop by Florida International coach Donnie Marsh's office at any given time and there is a good possibility you will find the fourth-year Golden Panther coach studying film with his new point guard, Marcus Robinson. 

The office, like most coaches', has a stack of videotapes wherever you look - around the television set, behind his desk and underneath the entertainment center on which his 32-inch set rests.

Scan the room and there are hints scattered throughout. Marsh's laptop computer flashes a scrolling marquee as his screen saver, and posters stacked on his desk display the team's motto for the season: "It's our time."

It's time to stay healthy and become more disciplined in order to sidestep the suspensions that hampered FIU last season, in which it won just eight games. Time to develop chemistry that was all but extinct during last year's 21-loss season. And time to add offense to a stellar defensive game that led the Sun Belt Conference in points allowed.

 Robinson, a junior transfer from South Mountain (AZ.) Community College, will have to shoulder the burden of leading what Marsh thinks is a team that can finally, "[have] the right pieces in place, get this thing turned."

All while adapting to a position that he has not played since his junior year at Mesa high school. The National Junior College Athletic Association named Robinson a third-team All-American after averaging 24.6 points per game last season as a shooting guard. 

"He has the ability to push it and see the floor and make other people better," said Marsh, who became interested in Robinson after seeing a tape in which he scored 42 points. "But he can score from the position also. 

"I have spent a great deal of time with Marcus. We do a lot of film work, he's come up here before class, after class, after practice; he wants to be a student, he wants to learn and wants to be on the same page."

Marsh feels Robinson has the ability to lead a team that will try to push the ball up the floor in order to net some easy baskets. For the past two seasons, FIU's main downfall has been not scoring enough points.  

This should not be a problem this year, as FIU returns star power forward Taurance Johnson (5.0 ppg in only two games), who missed most of last year due to suspension and guard Junior Matias (12.6 ppg).

Gone is forward Euliz Baez, who led the team in scoring (12.7 per game) and rebounding (8.2 per game). Center Byron Burnett (6-9, 258 pounds) will play center and be responsible for providing a presence up front. Burnett has impressed coaches and players during the preseason, averaging 7.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and four blocks per game.

Said Matias: "He's gonna be real good."

Forward Harry Lum, who had 12 rebounds in the team's final preseason game and guard Carlos Morban, who scored 15 points in the game, will also be looked upon to contribute.

But it will be Robinson's job to get them all involved.

The McDonald's All-American nominee as a high school senior, scored 30 points and dished out five assists in FIU's two exhibition victories last week.

"This is just a real good environment. Everything was just a real good fit for me. I really haven't had to change my style of game up since I've been here," Robinson said. "I am getting used to being more vocal in the locker room, and I'm just trying to buy into everything [Marsh] is trying to teach."

Being a scorer throughout high school and up until junior college, Robinson says he is adapting to the role of distributor and catalyst for the offense. "If it comes to the point where I need to run the offense as a distributor, I can do that," he said. "If I need to assert myself as a scorer, I can do that.

"My first goal is to get everyone else involved. Make sure they are all getting their touches and that way the offense will flow more smoothly."

Subheadline: A happy Bustamante ready to lead women's basketball to a successful year
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Sitting in her South Bend, Ind. apartment - three days before her second year of college was set to begin - Allison Bustamante realized the trade off between her happiness and all Notre Dame had to offer were no longer equivalent.

That is when the 6-0 guard decided she wanted to return to Florida where she had been a three-time all-state selection. Bustamante, an All-America honorable mention by Street and Smith's as a junior and senior at Lourdes Academy in Miami, eventually decided to transfer to FIU.

"I told [coach Muffet McGraw], if she could move Notre Dame down to Miami, I'd be the first to enroll. But it ultimately came down to me not being happy, and it transferred over to the court; it just wasn't worth it," said Bustamante, who averaged 4.6 points, 1.7 rebounds and 11.4 minutes a game as a freshman, including a 21-point performance against Syracuse.

After sitting out last season because of NCAA transfer rules, Bustamante feels she was able to appreciate other aspects of life. But she is ready to return to the court with a mentality that will enable her to have more fun while playing.

"It was ultimately beneficial to me. I think it was worth it because you don't lose that year and to a certain extent I was a real college student," she said. "But I am definitely ready to play, and looking forward to getting on that plane and going on that first trip."

The trip will be to the Spartan Classic in East Lansing, Mich., where FIU will try to improve on a disappointing 19-11 record a year after making the round of 32 in the NCAA tournament. The Golden Panthers will have eight players on their roster that did not see action for FIU last season.

In addition to Bustamante, FIU will be led by junior forward Milena Tomova, who scored a team-high 12 points and added six rebounds in the Golden Panthers' 57-44 win over Team Concept in the final preseason game last week.

FIU will also need solid play out of forward/center Dace Cinite, who averaged over 10 points and seven rebounds a season ago.

Guards Asha Neal and Faeza Bouderra will be counted on to provide depth out of the backcourt.

Both players combined for 10 points against Team Concept.

Freshman center Lasma Jekabsone should see considerable playing time down low and should help FIU with its rebounding. Jekabsone hauled in a team-high six rebounds against Team Concept.

Liene Bernstone, who scored six points on 3-of-7 shooting and added three rebounds against Team Concept will also see time in the middle.

Senior Doursiel Moore will see time at center and at forward after seeing only limited time last season.

Coach Cindy Russo has not yet chosen captains and hopes her team begins to come together soon. In the interim, Russo will look to guards Ivelina Vrancheva (10.8 ppg, 7.2 apg) and Deniz Boz (missed 2002-03 with an ACL tear), both of whom can execute the Panthers' up-tempo style of play.

Vrancheva averaged 10.8 points and 5.2 rebounds last season and is looking to improve those numbers with more playing time this year. Vrancheva also shot over 33 percent from beyond the three point line last season.

A healthy Boz scored 11 points and shot 5-of-6 from the line in last week's exhibition win over team Concept.

In addition to the fast-paced game the Panthers look for, Bustamante feels FIU has the personnel to conduct a half-court offense as well.

"She's really our purest shooter, she is really a good zone buster," said Russo of Bustamante, who led the Irish during the 01-02 season in three-point percentage. "Allison is a really smart ballplayer; she knows basketball. 

"She is a very mature individual. She understands all the players and understands the coaches so she would be a good liaison, but I wouldn't put that burden on a first year kid."

A Gift for Humanity
    It is the season of the year when we must find gifts for the special persons in our lives. Finding gifts can be difficult. My children and grandchildren have nearly everything. What can I possibility give them? 
   The poor, who now occupy my time...well, they need many things. But how do you gift-wrap: childcare, a vehicle for driving to work, an absent parent, a job with sufficient income and benefits to support a family, self-worth, and a plan to change one's life? 
   Nearly one half the world's population is trying to survive on less that $2 per day.  Yet, they must compete with us to buy the basic necessities in their lives. Do they understand this Christian nation's dilemma, where many are trying to decide what to give folks who have nearly everything? Is it any consolation to know that some here are choosing to simplify their lives and to be more generous?
   Maybe, I should keep it simple and give tee shirts. Yep! That's it. Tee shirts for all humanity...meaningful tee shirts with satire on the front (f) and on the back (b). Check the one that strikes your fancy and let me know your size. 

__(f) "God bless America" - The Christian Coalition. (b) I could bless the whole world ... do you care to help? - God. (This happens to be one of my favorites) 
__(f) The Earth can provide for everyone's needs- God. (b) Not for everyone's greed - Jesus. 
__(f) The trickle down theory - the current Social Plan. (b) Forget the poor, tax the middle class, and feed the rich- the GOP. 
__(f) " In God We Trust (as written on a dollar bill)"- rich Christians. (b) Really? ... Then give it to the poor-Jesus. 
__(f) The world's resources can only accommodate one America- the World. (b) Only the fittest are destined to survive- Charles Darwin, The American Enterprise Inst. & Pres. Bush.
__(f) "The negation of Nature, is the road toward true happiness"- John Locke. (b) "The land is scared, it belongs to all mankind, for it's creator is God"- Chief Seattle
__(f) We can recreate a world that accommodates humankind's every want.- Corp. Scientist.     (b) "First, let's consider the free regenerative capacities of the sun, the soil and the Spirit."-LS
__(f) " I will not partake of class war"- our President. (b) The poor are everywhere, where are the middle class going... who will feed the rich? - Oops!!!!...our boy George. 
__(f) "If the sun seems a little brighter, the water more purer, It's because I am back!"-Russ Limbaugh. (b) People...if you harness this little guy's blow, you will no longer need fossil fuels! - God and the Mother Earth News.
__(f) "The extent I take from creation's ability to offer life??" (b) "It can be measured by my worldly possessions, income, debts, wealth and net worth". - LS (perhaps my least favorite). 
     Now, ......for the tee shirt I wish to give everyone. 

X (f)"Ring out a slowly dying cause, 
         The faithless coldness of our times; 
     (b) Ring in the valiant man and free, 
         With larger heart, and kindlier hand.
          Ring in the Christ that is to be."- Tennyson. 
"A gift for all humanity." -Lynn Slagel, Goshen 		
Additional replacement shirts:
(f) Bullies that strut around, picking fights, are worrisome- The UN. (b) Tell the lil belligerents I'm coming.... And tell 'em hell's coming with Me!- Wyatt Earp & God.

Subheadline: Watch trashy soaps with pride
Author: Robert J. Gramatges / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I love television. It's weird because people are always afraid to say that they watch television. It just isn't a praiseworthy pastime. Watching television is associated with unhealthy fat people who sit on a couch all day eating Whoppers and left-over pizza. So not true. 

Most people watch television. Whether it's the news, Oprah, MTV or C-Span, television is being watched. 

What I find marvelous is the amount of people who say they don't watch it when everyone knows they do. 

There are two types of TV Nazis these days: those who really think that watching television is beneath them, and those who lie about how much television they watch. I can't stand either. I like watching television and have no problems with prioritizing it. 

Let's face it, watching an episode of "Alias" can be a lot more exciting than many other activities.  

I can't stand the "I don't have time for television" thing. People think it is so adult to say that. Give me a break. When I hear people say they don't have time for television I want to embarrass them. It's funny because I had someone tell me they didn't have time for television and later I noticed he had a 30-inch flat screen in his room, of all places. Being as petty as I can be, I shed light on the issue. 

"I thought you said you didn't have time for TV."

"I don't. TV is a waste. I have better things to do with my time"

"That's funny. So why do you have one?"

"Everybody has one."

"Maybe, but not everyone has a thousand dollar one; especially if they don't watch it. Wait a minute, is that a TiVo?"

Silence. I nailed him. Mr. I'm- too-hot-for-TV is a little liar. I bet he has a season pass for Lizzie McGuire. 

When people say: "I don't have time for television" what they are really saying is "I would rather not talk about television because all I watch is Disney Channel." 

The fact is that most people a) have time for television, and b) pretend they don't. I find it so annoying because I'll be talking about what transpired on "Everybody Loves Raymond" last night and some imbecile will smugly say, "I don't watch TV." Oh I am so sorry Mr. High-and-mighty. I am just so ordinary for watching television, aren't I? How uncivilized of me. 

What's funny is that when people hear I watch "Real World Road Rules Challenge: The Gauntlet," they automatically pigeonhole me. They assume I don't read books, take an interest in current events or care for politics. I mean sure, I'm not big on politics, but I do read. 

What one watches on television does not necessarily reflect who they are. I know a girl that watches "Charmed." Does that make her a witch? No, but there are some exceptions. If you watch C-Span it is more than likely that you are boring. I said it.  

In the end: It is one thing to make fun of a particular show or network, but it is quite another to insult the whole television-watching population. 

Talking trash about television makes you look bad because most people (yourself included) watch it. Capisce?

Headline: Cheaper, authentic vintage threads available at thrift stores
Author: Robert J. Gramatges / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Look
The vintage look has always been in style. Abercrombie's faded tees and torn up cargo pants are not groundbreaking in design. They imitate a look that has been around for years. Abercrombie and Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters and Lucky Brand, among others, capitalize on selling clothes that look vintage but offer the status of their brand names. 
Vintage pieces are innovative because the older an article of clothing is, the more likely that it is one of a kind and no one else will have them.  

The Real Thing
A good vintage is the same for clothing as it is for wine. There are some years whose clothes aged more gracefully than others. Vintage will always be cool because it represents what was fashionable in another time. 
Although it offers a large array of looks and possibilities, shopping at thrift stores is not for everyone. Halloween is usually the only time most people venture to second hand joints. 
But keep in mind that he designers that dress America's elite and dictate what is fashionable are getting their ideas for cheap at thrift stores. Remarkably, they are able to get the masses to dish out the dough for their knock-offs at retailers. The thought of paying more for a knock-off is ridiculous, yet people do it all the time when they shop for the vintage trend.

The Difference -
Salvation Army vs. A&F: 
The stores and locales are vastly different. 
Less overhead for thrift stores equals old lady/mothball- smelling sales floors located in random parts of town. Abercrombie, located in the mall, has hot posters and catalogs to look at, leather chairs to sit on. 
Thrift places require one to dig through the years of fashion mistakes and nasty shirts to find treasures. Everything at Abercrombie stores is wearable.  
Salvation Army sells garments that have been around the block. A&F sells virgin garments with the illusion that they have been around the block. 

The Logic 
There is something intriguing about a T-shirt from the '70s. People feel confident breathing life into old stuff and designers know this.  
It makes sense for people to look to the past for inspiration in terms of fashion. What does not make sense is the idea that anyone has to dish out major bucks to achieve this. The history of fashion is not on the racks of American Eagle Outfitters. The real thing is found on the racks of Goodwill and Red, White and Blue.  
 This is not to say that stores like Lucky Brand do not sell nice things. There are several lines of good quality clothes at these stores. But there is no logic in paying more money for less quality. If the same look can be achieved for less, why pay more? 
Sure, used clothes are just that, used. Contrary to popular belief, they are not dirty. They are clean and can be thrown in the wash at home to be safe. 

The Verdict
To be fair, thrift might be cheaper, but there are no guarantees. It requires good judgment and confidence to pick from old clothes. Retail shopping requires less concern, everything on the rack is wearable and within lush surroundings. 
It is up to the shopper to decide whether secondhand is OK with them. The important thing to remember is that when it comes to fashion, the possibilities are endless. There is more to wear than what the retail giants offer.

Headline: Duran Duran reunites, brings back glory of 1980s
Author: Heidi Stevens / Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
Somewhere in my parents' basement sits a cardboard box filled with cassette tapes of my interviews with Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes. 

Nick talking about his favorite movies. Nick discussing his boyhood. Nick laying out his plans for the future, which I was pretty sure included me.

OK, I wasn't really interviewing Nick, per se. But in 1984, my friend Tina played a very convincing stand-in, and I was a fierce interrogator, asking all the tough questions, such as "I love you and I love all your music and I love all the lyrics and I love all your videos and I love every magazine that has ever printed any picture of you and I just love, love, love you and I think you should do more shows in Chicago."

Nick was by far my favorite (Tina's too), but heck, we were crazy about the whole band. So you can imagine my excitement when I heard they were reuniting for a 25th anniversary tour. And I'm clearly not alone.

Duran Duran - purveyors of steamy, stylish music videos, archetypes of '80s fashion and frivolity and the objects of many a teenage girl's affection - was dubbed "The Fab Five" by Rolling Stone magazine in 1984 (decades before those "Queer Eye" fellas hijacked the term). 

That year, the band had its first No. 1 hit in the U.S. with "The Reflex" and released its single "Union of the Snake" to much acclaim. Simon LeBon, Rhodes, John Taylor, Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor (none related) split up in 1985 after recording four albums together. 

A couple of failed spinoff groups later, an abbreviated Duran Duran, made up of LeBon, Rhodes and John Taylor, continued to tour and record together through 2000, producing some respectable albums, but never quite capturing the magic of their '80s heyday.

Until now.

Shows have been selling out in minutes. Celebrities - including Nicolas Cage, Beck and Gwen Stefani in Los Angeles, and Moby, The Donnas and Debbie Harry in New York - have been spotted rocking out to the band's dance-pop tunes.

Rhodes (the real one this time - dreams do come true), the band's keyboardist, chatted with us recently about the tour, the '80s and his own brand of philosophy.

Q: Whose idea was it to reunite?

A: It's sort of always been something that was on the menu. We all said, never say never. But it actually reached a point where we finished an album that cycle and we decided to part company with Hollywood Records, which I think I can say was not our greatest experience. Simon and I were in L.A. and we went over to see John. (John) said "If we're going to do it, it's now or never."

Q: Where were Roger and Andy?

A: Roger was in London. He said: "If everyone is up for it, we should meet." Andy got in a little later. Some months later we all met up in London, looked at each other around the table, argued, wrote some songs to see if we still had the right kind of chemistry. Andy had done a bunch of production work, a couple of albums of his own. Roger had been doing some dance music. We went into the studio and starting writing and that turned out extremely well. And so from that point we realized it was viable.

Q: When you performed at the Roxy this summer, the place was crawling with stars, you got great reviews from critics. Same with New York a month later. You had to add a third show here in Chicago. Were you surprised by such positive responses?

A: You never expect that, but we were thrilled. There's a nice pattern developing and we're very pleased that audiences want to come see us. The shows have been so exciting. This is the first time a lot of people have seen this lineup, or at least since 1984. That in itself has been a real buzz.

Q: What's different now?

A: It's a very different energy. We're very much a band that's fully functional because all five of us write together. Andy is definitely edgier than Warren (Cuccurullo), in more of a rock sense. That's juxtaposed against my keyboards and Roger and John's grooves, and that's still very much what we sound like. When we said, "Let's play an old song" for the first time, we played "Hungry Like The Wolf," and it sounded just like the record. That's just the noise we make, and it's nice to know it's still intact.

Q: Who are you into now, musically?

A: All kinds of things. I like a lot of hip-hop stuff. I just got the Outkast album, which I like very much. Goldfrapp - I really, really love Goldfrapp. They're one of the most creative, interesting bands to come out in long, long time. I like The Rapture. A lot of stuff.

Q: Do any of those groups influence your music?

A: I don't think directly, but we soak things up, and we all listen to a lot of music, so the record sounds like a contemporary version of the old Duran Duran. We sound like we should sound now. Rock and groove crossover, stuff with electronica, it all fits in with what's going in.

Q: Do you ever watch "I Love the '80s" on VH1?

A: No.

Q: Duran Duran is featured pretty prominently.

A: I think of the '80s with a great fondness. We had some impact in that decade, so I think it's natural we would be mentioned. A lot of great stuff came out of the '80s: Us, Depeche Mode, The Cure, Madonna.

Q: Do you look back on anything from that era and go "Oh, God. That's so embarrassing"?

A: Oh, there's always an odd haircut knocking around, isn't there? But creatively, as far as recording, absolutely not. We had great quality control because there were so many of us. There's always been someone to tap on your shoulder and say, "That's really not working."

Q: Do you ever get tired of John always being referred to as the best looking one?

A: Well, we just have to tolerate that he's better looking than the rest of us. I think John's always going to have a certain amount of female admirers.

Q: Speaking of which, is your audience a lot older now?

A: They're younger than ever before. Bizarrely, what's happened is a lot of kids who weren't even born (in Duran Duran's heyday) are curious as to what it is. I guess a lot of other bands have cited us as influences and we're getting a lot of really young kids coming to check us out, obviously mixed with older people, too.

Q: Last thing. What is a Union of the Snake?

A: It's taken from kundalini, an ancient Eastern philosophy about a dormant snake that rises up through the body and gives you energy.

Q: How do you spell that?

A: I have no idea. You'll have to go stick it in Google.

Headline: Beatles-esque Beulah postpones breakup to record Yoko
Author: Mark de la Vina / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
In the two years since the indie pop band Beulah released its latest record, three of its seven members got divorced, and the group decided to call it a career.

But after lead singer Miles Kurosky completed a strong batch of new songs, most of them addressing the end of his relationship with his fiancee, the Beatles-esque band from San Francisco put its breakup on indefinite hold.

The new material, which pushed the septet into more mature thematic territory than heard on earlier Beulah discs, demanded a jolting title. Yoko is what the band came up with.

"Yoko certainly is a provocative word," says Kurosky during a phone interview from his hotel room in Minneapolis. "Yoko Ono is pretty tremendous as an artist, but in a lot of ways she was like our muse, to break away from some Beatles comparisons."

Shedding old skin has been a recurring theme for Beulah. Naming this adventurous disc after Ono, the often misunderstood maverick who inspired husband John Lennon to test new artistic waters, strikes Ono as fitting.

"Well, I really blessed Beulah, because it's going back to being real," Ono says via e-mail through her publicist. "I think Beulah is starting to do something on a different level. It's very close to the kind of writing that was done in the `60s. People just wanted to be real. It's good it's coming back."

Ono, whose name has become synonymous with a girlfriend or wife who splinters a rock band, was "probably one of the most remarkable and fascinating women in the last half-century," Kurosky says. 

Before the group received permission from her to use her name, the working title for the disc was "All the Beatles Are Dying, But Please Don't Blame Yoko."

Though often seen in negative terms by Beatles fans, it was Ono's encouragement and performance-art background that inspired Lennon to experiment, breaking from the tried and true, says Beulah's 34-year-old singer-guitarist.

"We wanted to make a more artistic statement with this record, a more mature, more challenging sort of thing," he says. "The title seemed right. And no one ever asked me why I named the last record `The Coast Is Never Clear.'"

Yoko, Beulah's fourth disc, is darker and more adult than the previous CDs, with lyrics that tackle the kind of issues lost on a younger band. Songs about spiritual displacement and the emotional miasma of a long-term relationship gone bad belie Beulah's ultra-catchy, hook-filled pop sound.

Since the group's 1997 debut disc, "Handsome Western States," Beulah's sonic calling card has been lush Brian Wilson-style arrangements with strings, staccato horns and infectious "ba-da-ba" background vocals. On Yoko, just a hint of those elements remain.

Next up for Beulah is the chance to reconnect with Ono, when the band remixes one of her songs. 

Kurosky says the band is unsure which Ono tune it will do, but it has received her blessing "to pick any one we want. Then we're going to Beulah-ize it."

Except for the Beulah song "A Good Man Is Easy to Kill," the track from "The Coast Is Never Clear" now featured in a TV commercial for the Nissan Altima, the Ono project could give Beulah its greatest exposure so far.

"We have never done anything like this in our entire life," Kurosky says. "That's quite an honor."

Headline: "The Cat":  "It is fun to have fun, but you have to know how"
Author: Jay Boyar / The Orlando Sentinel
&nbsp;
Sadly, "Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat" is not what you'd call a movie classic, even though the book on which it's based is a classic of kiddie lit.

The movie is so disappointing, in fact, that it makes "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas" look like a masterpiece. 

Where the "Grinch" film of 2000 at least made some attempt to capture that special Seussian magic, "Cat" is a different animal. It uses the characters and basic situation from the book, but it lacks the book's half-mad comic style.

The only even remotely stylish thing about the film is its look, and that is hardly original. "Cat's" storybook-cum-theme-park visuals seem like outtakes from "Grinch." And when you consider that the new film's director, Bo Welch, is a production designer making his directorial debut, everything starts to make sense.

It may be a measure of Welch's desperation that he's added goofy cartoon music as a background for many dialogue scenes. Did he think that, without it, we wouldn't realize that the film is supposed to be funny?

Mike Myers, who plays the Cat, is physically wrong for the role. In the book, the Cat is drawn tall and lean, with a beatnik scruffiness. He's an anarchic outsider whose wild antics seem almost to have a political subtext. 

Myers' Cat is a well-groomed fat cat with no such agenda. He's just a silly-dilly. That said, Myers' performance is the only reason to see the movie. Under his signature red-and-white-striped hat, he's weirdly convincing. 

Myers plays the Cat as if he were the fearless cousin of the Cowardly Lion from "The Wizard of Oz." There's something of the urban prowler in his voice, and his gestures have the Lion's feline fussiness.

The resourceful comedian mixes in other elements, too.

This Cat has multiple personalities, so there's also a British Cat, a hippie Cat and a sort of Martha Stewart Cat, more than one of whom might simultaneously be present. And when the Cat suddenly goes Carmen Miranda, you can't help but think Bugs Bunny.

Like Seuss' book, the film tells the tale of a couple of kids, Sally and Conrad, who are left home alone for the day. Into their lives comes the Cat and his weird little helpers, Thing 1 and Thing 2.

The movie invents a boyfriend for the kids' single mom, a phony who keeps threatening Conrad with military school.

As that boyfriend, Alec Baldwin is a good sport, thrusting out a big belly and taking out false teeth in a scene that's designed to show that everything about this guy is phony.

Kelly Preston is Mom, while Dakota Fanning ("Uptown Girls") and Spencer Breslin (Disney's "The Kid") are the kids. Providing the voice of the story's goldfish conscience is Sean Hayes, the sprite from "Will & Grace," who is also cast as Mom's demanding boss.

No, that boss isn't in the book, either. But Seuss' original story is so slim that the filmmakers probably had to come up with something to pad it out.

Something, but not necessarily this. As the Cat in the Hat in the book advises:

	It is fun to have fun

	But you have to know how.

Headline: "Gothika": Formulaic thriller will make you jump nonetheless
Author: Vivan Little / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Dr. Miranda Grey is the prototypical damsel in distress as she is left reeling when her world flips upside down. 

Her doting husband is murdered in their home, and she is the only suspect. Adding to the dilemma, the town sheriff happens to be the best friend of Miranda's deceased husband. Halle Berry plays Miranda with force and liveliness, yet even that can't save this formulaic thriller.  

The cast of supporting characters is magnificent, with a dazzling John Carroll Lynch, the gifted Robert Downey Jr., and clever Charles Dutton. Lynch portrays the bumbling, baffled Sheriff Ryan exceedingly well. Downey Jr. plays Pete Graham, a sweetly funny doctor, who hovers around Grey with adoring eyes. He seems only one of a fellowship of worshippers as Dutton depicts a paternal-like husband smitten with his gorgeous wife. 

How does all this intricate cuteness quickly shift to petrifying drama?  Clinging to the typecast of a scary movie, it is a cold, dark, rainy night as Miranda drives down a lone highway and encounters a classic hair-in-the-face, forbidding female ghost. As the specter spurts flames, the screen goes dark and Miranda awakens in the mental institution she used to work in. Miranda is abused, confused and stalked as this moody ghoul tries to warn the other characters of a ominous evil in the community.

The movie is built on stereotypes and heaped with lyrical dialogue. It tries to recall the elements of a gothic novel, with its daunting plot, flickering lights and misunderstood-woman scheme. This swift, startling movie, while not exactly bloodcurdling, throws in enough twists and turns to make it enjoyable. The characters portrayed are crudely simplistic and the plot is the bastard child of an amalgamation of classic horror films, yet it is still a fun, stylish and startling film. 

Berry, Lynch, Downey Jr. and Dutton aren't able to display all their talent in these shallow roles, almost caricatures of sufferers and imps. Even Penelope Cruz's brief few cameo as Chloe, a crazed former patient of Dr.Grey's, leaves the viewer wondering how a refined actress could portray such a dowdy, superficially-scripted victim.

This movie is enjoyable enough to pay for if you're longing for a creepy thriller that will cause you to jump. What "Gothika" is lacking in plot substance and character development it makes up for with sheer shock, eerie chases and paranormal fight scenes. Don't judge this film by its cheesy title; it's still worth seeing, even if it won't be headlining the Oscar's this year.

Headline: FIU Theater enhances Shakespeare experience
Author: Enrique Hecker / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The crowd sifted through the doors of FIU's Mainstage Theatre on opening night of "As You Like It." The stage was littered with rehearsing actors who practiced stunts while exchanging verse as the crew busily organized pastoral costumes on metal racks that remained visible throughout the play. The atmosphere felt like a taping of "Saturday Night Live." The director was in on it too - instructing the players and cajoling them while sipping Aquafina, as the last of the audience finally trickled in.

A new character in the play, Yecid, functions as the MC, introducing the actors while singing and strumming chords on an acoustic guitar. He presented all the actors by their real names along with the names of their characters, during which he found a moment to harmonize with the actress playing Rosalind in a beautiful rendition of "Don't Know Why" by Norah Jones. 

The prelude concluded as the lights dimmed to a cool and continuous glow, illuminating the grand, circular platform that filled the playing space. The majestic drapes in the background took on the wild leaves of the forest of Arden, as the FIU Theatre Department prepared to conquer the Shakespearean production, "As You Like It." 

It is truly remarkable that set designer, Craig A. Young, in conjunction with director, Wayne E. Robinson, Jr., decided to produce the entire play on a raked stage, a stage that is elevated at an angle. 

The stage looks like a giant quarter with the diameter of about thirty feet, and raised from behind at a thirty-five degree angle. 

The steep incline forced the actors to learn how to center their balance throughout the rehearsal process so that they could eventually maintain their focus and control throughout the most physically demanding scenes, such as the engaging wrestling match. 

Nevertheless, the actors kept their balance and their focus as they fully enacted the comedy without the use of props or scenery. This is perhaps one of the most challenging ways to perform any type of theatre, for many actors tend to rely on props and set pieces to facilitate their acting. 

Yet such was not the case with this interpretation, as the actors were forced to use their voices, their bodies and their costumes in the place of props, thus planting the focus of the audience on the characters rather than on the spectacle. 

Swift cuts made to the script provide for an easy understanding of the plot, while Marylyn Skow's creative costume design allows for easy recognition of the 22 characters who are played by 13 actors. 

Sometimes, two characters played by the same actor are forced to appear onstage at the same time. This was quite entertaining in the case of Kristian Cardenas, who switched between his two characters, Silvius and Duke Senior, during the same scene and conversation. 

The insightful heroine of the play, Rosalind, is played by Jennifer Rumberger, who captures the full essence of Rosalind in a perfect performance. Her lines are polished and executed with ease, and her close relationship with Celia, the sidekick cousin played by Melissa Almaguer, is sincere. 

 However, Meshaun Arnold steals the show with his portrayal of the lovesick Orlando. Recently nominated for a Best Actor Carbonell award, Arnold commands the stage and the audience; his emotions are pure and his instincts as an actor are phenomenal. 

His physical control and vocal capabilities engage the audience in the continuity of the plot, thus simplifying Shakespeare and making it easier to understand. 

Though most of the cast dominates the Elizabethan language and their characters, Katie Perry fails to do so with her portrayal of Jaques. 

The melancholy character is essential to the story; he is the figure that remains unchanged at the plays' end, and the final impact needs to be stronger. 

Perry played into the melancholy instead of truly feeling it, which made the character and her performance suffer. 

However, her other character, Lady Lebeau, is quite refreshing, while Crystal Edn's depiction of Touchstone the clown is as colorful as her jester outfit. 

Original music, unique lighting, and a strong cast make this the best Shakespeare performance at FIU yet!
