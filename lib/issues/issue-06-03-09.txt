Headline: Baseball scores 33 total in home sweep of Bears
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The baseball team scored a combined 33 runs and kept its season pattern of sweep or be swept in a three-game sweep of New York Tech March 3-5 at University Park Stadium.

The Golden Panthers evened up their record at 8-8 and New York Tech begins its 2006 season at  0-3.

"I didn't think we pitched as well as I thought we were going to," head coach Danny Price said. "But at the same time, I thought [New York Tech] swung the bats [well]."

The baseball team continues its 14-game March homestand and hopes to add to their eight-game home winning streak with a three-game series against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights March 10-12.



FIU 8, NYT 4



FIU opened up its weekend sweep with the help of starting pitcher Walker Whitley. The redshirt junior allowed seven hits, four unearned runs and struck out 10 batters - recording his first career complete game and raising his record to 3-1 on the season.

The Golden Panthers were led offensively by Bryan Pullin and Luis Bautista - each recording two hits. Bautista, along with Michael Lopez and Alex Alfonso, recorded two RBIs.

FIU got on the board early, scoring two runs in the bottom of the first inning.  Pullin scored on a Lopez ground out, after leading off the game with a single to right field.  Then, with two outs in the inning, Bautista blasted a solo homerun to right centerfield to make the score 2-0.

The Bears took a 3-2 lead (off two FIU errors), which was immediately erased when FIU scored three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning. Sophomore James McOwen hit a two-RBI triple down the right field line and was brought home two batters later with an Alfonso sacrifice bunt.

The Bears added another unearned run in the fifth inning to make the score 5-4, but that was the closest they would get as FIU scored three unanswered in the last four innings to hold on to the victory.



FIU 13, NYT 12



Seven Golden Panthers recorded a hit in a match that featured seven errors, 28 combined hits and 25 combined runs.

Pullin and Chris Dunn had three hits each, while infielders Nick Cadena and Corey Lozano record two apiece, as FIU recorded 15 hits as a team.

Frank Gonzalez got the win in relief of starter Kyle Preshong. The senior pitched the final five and one-third innings, allowed four runs, walked two and struck out three batters.

The victory was sparked by an FIU three-run rally in the bottom of the seventh inning. Trailing 12-10, a misplayed Dunn bunt single, with two runners on based, scored Cody Jacobs from second base. A wild pitch tied the game at 12. Dunn scored what would be the game-winning run on a Lopez sacrifice fly ball.

FIU took an early, commanding 6-1 lead, after scoring three runs in each of the first and second innings. 

It was back-and-forth from that point on as the Bears answered back with one run in the third and six runs in the fourth inning, giving them an 8-6 lead. FIU erased the lead with four runs in the bottom of the fourth to make it 10-8.

New York Tech scored four runs in the sixth to make it 12-10, right before FIU's three-run rally in the bottom of the seventh. 



FIU 12, NYT 9



FIU completed the sweep of New York Tech in the final game of the series.

Alfonso, who was hit by three pitches in the game, hit a mammoth solo homerun over the left field wall in the bottom of the eighth inning to cap off FIU's 12-9 victory.

"I guess I'm just a magnet," Alfonso said. "It's been like that all my life. I just wanted to get a hit [and the homerun] was more for revenge and getting a hit."

FIU was led offensively by McOwen, who went 3-for-4 with a double, a triple and four RBI.

Eric Horstmann picked up the win in relief of starter Jorge Ramos, who allowed six runs in only two innings pitched. Horstmann pitched the final seven innings, allowed three runs (only one earned), two hits, walked two and struck out four batters.

FIU jumped out two an early 3-0 as Lopez hit a solo homerun to right field and McOwen added a two-run triple in the bottom of the first.

New York Tech took a 6-3 lead after the second inning, to which FIU replied by tying the game in the bottom of that same inning.

The Golden Panthers would take the lead for good, scoring three runs in the bottom of the fourth and two more in the bottom of the fifth.

The Bears added three more runs in the sixth inning off only one hit, to make the score 11-9.  

Alfonso's three HBPs tied an FIU record.

Headline: Women eliminated in semifinals

&nbsp;
MURFREESBORO, Tenn. - The women's basketball team's first trip back to the Sun Belt Conference semifinals since it won the championship in 2002 didn't go quite as planned. 

After cruising through their first two games, fueled by the play of junior Lasma Jekabsone, FIU ran into the best team in the conference and couldn't quite cope. 

The Golden Panthers (18-12, 10-6) fell to the conference favorites from Western Kentucky (24-5, 13-2) 66-58 in front of 974 mostly Hilltopper fans at the Murphy Center on the eve of the conference finals. 

"It was anybody's game until the end," said head coach Cindy Russo. "That's all you can ask in these types of tournaments, to have your players compete like that."

Jekabsone led the way for the third straight game for FIU, but wise adjustments from the Hilltoppers coaching staff midway through the first half put a damper on FIU's upset hopes. 

Following the loss, Jekabsone was willing to put the loss solely on her shoulders. 

"I didn't make the right decisions," Jekabsone said. "They picked up their defense and we had too many turnovers." 

The Latvia native finished the afternoon leading all scorers with 24 points, 16 of which came in the first half, on 10-of-15 shooting. For the first time in four games, she failed to record a double-double, managing just six rebounds. 

Senior Faeza Bouderra was the only other Golden Panther in double figures, notching 13 points on 4-of-11 shooting after being held field goal-less in the quarterfinals. 

Last season's conference player of the year, Tiffany Porter-Talbert, had one of her best performances of the season, taking over the game in the second half. She finished with 21 points, leading WKU. 

Crystal Kelly, who had averaged over 20 points a game this season, added 14 as she and Sarah Shouse had the tough task of defending Jekabsone.  

FIU attacked the favored Lady Hilltoppers from the start, showing no signs of having lost twice against them during the regular season. 

After a back and forth start, FIU took command through Jekabsone, whose play down in the paint extended FIU's lead to as much as seven, 21-14, during the first half. 

Mary Taylor Cowles called a quick timeout as her team started the game shooting just 5-of-26 and her team came back onto the floor with a much different game plan. 

WKU, who was riding a 12-game conference win streak, brought in 6-5 center Shouse to play on Jekabsone and the Latvian suffered the rest of the way. 

"When you have someone out there that is your same size it hinders you from doing what you usually do against shorter post players," Shouse said.

Western Kentucky went on a 14-2 run following the stoppage and rallied to lead 32-29 at the half. 

FIU made the adjustments in the second half and came out firing. It tied the game through a LaQuetta Ferguson 3-pointer on the first possession of the half. 

The two teams then shared baskets up until the 9:29 mark, when FIU lost its last lead of the game. 

After the Hilltoppers took the lead through a Kelly jumper with 8:11 left, they never looked back. They finished the game on a 16-10 run and booked their place in the final against tournament hosts Middle Tennessee. 

FIU's season is not yet over, however, as they may be invited to the Women's NIT. Russo and her team will wait until Selection Sunday on March 12 to confirm the invitation.

Headline: Overturning Roe v. Wade would not outlaw abortion
Author: Peter A. Brown / KRT Campus
&nbsp;
Americans think that abortion ought to be legally available, but not easy to get.

Of course not everyone feels that way, but the polling data show that to be the consensus position in the United States on this most emotional of issues. Moreover, Americans' views are long-held and unlikely to change.

But no one should be under the misconception that abortion would become illegal throughout the United States if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

All this is worth remembering as it appears we are headed for a new, and perhaps higher stakes, series of court and political fights over this issue. 

The Supreme Court has agreed to decide the constitutionality of a congressional ban on a late-term procedure - a law that seems to be the kind of restriction most Americans favor. There are many who think the addition of John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the court bodes well for this law, even though it was thrown out by lower courts.

And, the court will almost certainly find itself ruling down the road on an expected South Dakota law that appears to conflict with Roe v. Wade and bans nearly all abortions. 

Both Roberts and Alito said in their confirmation hearings they would respect established court precedent, such as the 1973 Roe decision.

The anti-abortion rights groups that think they can leverage their stronghold on the Republican Party to halt all abortions ought to understand just how far they are from majority support nationally; but the abortion-rights folks who would allow a 15-year-old to terminate her pregnancy in the eighth month without her parents' knowledge are just as out of touch with Middle America.

Several polls of Americans taken during January's confirmation hearings for Alito tell the tale.

A CBS-New York Times survey found that 38 percent felt abortion should be generally available, 39 percent favored stricter limits, but only 21 percent said it should not be permitted. A Gallup/USA poll found only 25 percent wanted Roe overturned, but 38 percent thought abortion laws should be made stricter, 20 percent wanted them looser and 39 percent liked the status quo.

Americans tell pollsters they favor restrictions on abortion rights that would require minors to notify or get their parents' consent, set waiting periods and prohibit women from having the procedure in the final trimester of pregnancy. 

The case that will go before the Supreme Court involves one type of late-term abortion. Its critics call such procedures partial birth abortions because they occur when the fetus' head is lodged in the birth canal. The fetus is brought out feet first and the skull is punctured to allow doctors to vacuum out the brain. The procedure is known medically as "intact dilation and evacuation."

When asked specifically about this procedure, strong majorities of Americans tell pollsters they do not think it should be legal.

The key issue in this case, and others involving abortion restrictions, is a 1992 Supreme Court decision that upheld Roe and said the law could not impose an "undue burden" on women. That, until now, has been interpreted to mean that any law must protect the health/life of the mother, an exception that abortion-rights opponents say has been abused.

The case is likely to be heard in the fall during an election campaign that was already expected to be emotionally charged, given the war in Iraq and deep divisions within the country.  

The betting is that since Alito replaced Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the swing vote on restrictions, his support of some other abortion limitations as an appeals-court judge might indicate his inclination and lead to reversal of lower courts ruling.

An effort to block the South Dakota law is unlikely to reach the Supreme Court for some time. But even if the court were to reverse Roe, that would not make abortion illegal nationally.

It would just leave it up the states to decide how to handle the issue within their borders.

Given public opinion, that probably means that in some states abortion would become illegal, but in most it would be available under varying restrictions. If nothing else, Americans would then begin paying a lot more attention to their state legislators.

Subheadline: Article ignorant about Christians' contribution to science
Author: Bill Harvelle / Catholic Campus Lay Minister
&nbsp;
In a recent opinion article, Adrian Diaz, assistant opinion editor of The Beacon, proceeded to compare Scientology's beliefs with Christianity's. His conclusion: they are equally absurd. I want to give Diaz some credit where it's due; either Jesus was what he claimed to be, and that is God, or he was a delusional liar; he could not simply have been "a good teacher" because what "good teacher" audaciously claims to be divine? So let's examine some of the crazy Christian beliefs so we can see really how crazy they are (or are not). 

Modern science was born in the Roman Catholic Church. Are all those crazy Christian scientists, like Louis Pasteur, Fr. Giambattista Riccioli (first to measure a freely falling body's rate of acceleration), Fr. Athanasius Kircher (the father of Egyptology), Fr. Roger Boscovich (called the father of modern atomic theory), Fr. Georges Lemaître (father of the Big Bang theory) absurd like space cowboy L. Ron Hubbard? 

Back in the 400s, Saint Augustine already saw God like a geometer, having read in Wisdom 11:21 that God has made all things in measure, number, and weight. Why is it only the crazy Western Christians in history that enjoys unique success in the sciences? 

To the crazy Western Christians the universe was orderly and rational, and therefore worthy of investigation. Five centuries before economist Adam Smith, crazy Catholic priests developed the idea of free-market economics - is this another Christian absurdity? In his "History of Economic Analysis" (1954), Joseph Schumpeter, a widely recognized great economist of recent times, writes of late 16th and 17th century Spanish theologians, "[I]t is they who come nearer than does any other group to having been the 'founders' of scientific economics." 

It was these Christian crazies that established accurate theories of value, price, government intervention, monopoly, entrepreneurship, and money and banking. It just keeps getting crazier, don't it? 

And those crazy Christians were the ones who gave us international law, not the so-called 'Enlightenment' thinkers. This was founded in the Christian delusion of the fundamental unity of the human race. Human rights don't spring from  Locke or Jefferson, but from canon law. What a bunch of wackos! 

Do you like fine metals, delicious bread, and a great tasting beer? Thank those crazy Christian monks for their metallurgy, agriculture, and brewing. 

Let us never forget that Christianity gave us the university, and without her, there is no FIU and no Beacon to opine in - it's all insane! Nothing like the university existed in antiquity - it is an utterly Christian phenomenon. 

It's clear that our civilization is greatly indebted to Christianity, in terms of philosophy, art, architecture, technologies, international law, charities, economics, and so on. To deny this would indeed be insane, a terrible condition known as deconstructionist subjectivism. But as far as Diaz is concerned, I think it's just plain old ignorance, something as old as the common cold.

Subheadline: Articles' bashing of Christianity irrelevant
Author: Luciano Molina / Senior / Philosophy and History major
&nbsp;
I think it is both unprofessional and unethical using journalism in order to promote one's own personal views (or biases) on religion. Mr. Adrian Diaz wrote an article in order (I want to believe) to inform us about Scientology, but instead ended up comparing it with Christianity in how "absurd" these two religious beliefs are. One thing I got clear from the article: that Mr. Diaz is not only a non-Christian, but also considers this religion absurd. He indeed provided some info about Scientology's origin and some of its maxim, but he did it only to prove how stupid Scientology is. At one point I really asked myself, why was it important to put Christianity into the article? In what way was it a relevant point? Perhaps Mr. Diaz can answer these questions for me. 

As you might be rightly assuming, I am a Christian. The difference, however, is that what I say differs from what Mr. Diaz wrote in that I am not a newsman.

And yet, Mr. Diaz's religious views are also manifest, even when he is trying to do journalism and not some sort of ideological propaganda.

As for the "insane beliefs" that we Christians hold, I would only like to say to Mr. Diaz that there are plenty of insane beliefs that people (even FIU professors) regard as true in spite of their absurdity. Mr. Diaz: did you ever ask yourself  whether it makes sense to say that our universe exists inside a big explosion? I mean, did you ever perceive something existing inside a firecracker or any other sort of explosive devise? Did you not find absurd that physicists have proven that solid, material objects are composed mostly of empty space? 

I do not want to sound as a Christian apologist, but Mr. Diaz should consider that we indeed live in an "absurd" universe. 

That people like to believe in God as an explanation to all these absurdities is better, I think, that not to provide an explanation at all.

Headline: Sheehan simply looking for publicity
Author: Christopher Necuze / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
I have just about had it with Cindy Sheehan's anti-American antics. As an American, she is entitled to her opinion and I respect that, but the things she says demeans everyone in this country. It has gotten to the point where she is not just putting down President Bush in her antics, she is insulting all Americans - not to mention the very troops which fought alongside her son before he was killed.

For months now, Cindy Sheehan has been a regular face on the national news media; she has virtually become the face of the anti-war effort in America. 

At first, it really didn't bother me. Her demonstrations were peaceful - I may not have agreed with her, but she wasn't hurting anyone. It wasn't until I started hearing some of the things she was saying did I take notice to the founder of Camp Casey, the protest camp she had set-up outside of President Bush's ranch in Texas.

In an August 15, 2005 interview on "Hardball with Chris Matthews," Sheehan told Matthews that her position would not be different even if her son would have died in Afghanistan. When Matthews pointed out that the Taliban, the then government of Afghanistan was harboring Al-Qaeda, the group responsible for planning and executing the attacks of September 11, 2001, she responded by simply saying, "Well then, we should have gone after Al-Qaeda and maybe not after the country of Afghanistan." 

Now, I'm sure that Sheehan didn't hear what Matthews had just finished saying. The government of Afghanistan was harboring terrorists, the same ones that attacked the U.S. in 2001. Call me crazy, but that makes the government just as bad as the terrorists themselves. 

Criticism hit close to home when Sheehan's sister-in-law, speaking for the rest of the family, wrote this letter to Matt Drudge, a news personality, whom then made it public: "We do not agree with the political motivations and publicity tactics of Cindy Sheehan. She now appears to be promoting her own personal agenda and notoriety at the expense of her son's good name and reputation. The rest of the Sheehan Family supports the troops, our country and our President, silently, with prayer and respect."

Sheehan's rebutted this by admitting that a lot of her family was at odds with her political beliefs, but that her children and her husband were "all on the same page." Her husband filed for divorce soon after she made that statement. A divorce would have sent most people into self-examination mode, but not Cindy Sheehan. 

When the press was preoccupied with other, more ridiculous things, like those pesky hurricanes - and she was no longer center of attention - she had this to say: "I am watching CNN and it is 100 percent [Hurricane] Rita ... even though it is a little wind and a little rain ... it is bad, but there are other things going on in this country today ... and in the world!" As soon as the media turns its eye away, Sheehan starts to cry. Her insensitivity towards the hurricane victims of the Gulf Coast earned her the chastisement of her supporters, one of which pointed out "The right-wing media has painted you as a self-centered, self-absorbed woman and you're living up to that image."

Before making that statement, Sheehan had blamed the hurricane on the Bush Administration. Wait a minute, let me make that clear, she blamed the actual hurricane - not the response - on President Bush. 

Cindy Sheehan was invited to Venezuela by President Hugo Chavez. She told reporters that "I admire President Chavez for his strength to resist the United States." She then agreed to previous statements made by Harry Belafonte, an African-American social activist, saying that President Bush was the world's biggest terrorist.

Although it is tragic that Sheehan lost her son in this war, she refuses to accept that others as well have lost their families. As a mother, it is her right to mourn the death of her son, but she has no right to use his name strictly for publicity purposes. That is where at least I draw the line.

Headline: Grads find convenience in one stop
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
For the first time, graduating students will have to make one stop to get all of their commencement needs. 

In the past, graduating students had to go to the Office of Registrars to make sure they had all the credits needed to graduate and then they had to head over to the Graduation Office to get commencement tickets. Another stop if interested, was to walk over to the Alumni  Association office and sign-up to become a member. Lastly, they had to pass by the FIU Bookstore to pick up their regalia. 

Instead of having graduating students running around from office to office to get these procedures done, students now go to the University Park FIU Bookstore during 'Grad Send Off' March 13 through 15 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Biscayne Bay Campus already had their Grad Send Off March 6 and 7, and the Pines Center will have their own March 18 from 10 a.m. to noon and March 29 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. 

"Students are already too busy, so the [FIU] Bookstore, Alumni Association and the Office of the Registrars have joined forces to offer a one-stop place for all your graduation needs," said Chris Quaintance, operations manager of the FIU Bookstore.

Grad Send Off was organized by Duane Wiles, senior director of membership of Alumni Relations, Barbara Bader, director of leadership program in Academic Affairs, and A. Phredd Hunter, assistant general manager of the business services. 

"Our goal is to make this a bigger event every semester," Hunter said.

At Grad Send Off, students can pick up their regalia and pick up their commencement tickets. Staff from the Office of the Registrars will be on hand so students can make sure they are ready to graduate. Bob Knight Photography will be there so students can take graduation photos and students will be able to order class rings, custom graduation announcements, purchase diploma frames and diploma holders. 

Commencement ceremony DVD's can be ordered as well. Students that become members of the Alumni Association will receive 10 percent off select merchandise at the FIU Bookstore and a discount at the Starbucks on the second floor of the FIU Bookstore. E-mails were sent to potential walking graduates from Alumni Association and the Commencement Committee letting students know about Grad Send Off.

"I think it's a great way to do everything in one shot [and] it's planned really well," said senior Dianne Cordova.

Headline: Jewish organization promotes Torah, travel
Author: Rina Lankry / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There is a collection of Jewish organizations in Biscayne Bay Campus and University Park that can provide the Jewish student population opportunities to meet other Jewish students, learn more about their heritage and offer low-cost spring break and summer trips. 

One of these organizations is the Collegiate Learning Exchange. Their programming is a combination of serious, intellectual stimulation and social events such as paint-balling, bowling, Karaoke and attending Miami Heat games.

"Students can achieve so much personal growth through accessing the wisdom that Judaism offers," said Rabbi Saj Freiberg, director of CLE and  adjunct professor in FIU's religious studies.

Jewish students, like junior Elli Gigi, said he is an asset to the program.

"Rabbi Freiberg is a very young, energetic guy, [whom] students can relate to. He raps, he beat-boxes and he goes completely wild when we have [a] party," said Gigi,  who attends CLE's events.

A foreigner to Miami, Gigi wanted to meet others like herself.

"When I first moved, it was very hard for me to make new friends and, naturally, being Jewish, you tend to look for other Jews," Gigi said. "If you see a Rabbi tabling at FIU don't be intimidated by the Rabbis because they're great guys. Just go up to them and talk to them."

CLE is open to Jewish students from all affiliations. Like other Jewish organizations on campus, they teach Torah, which is the Hebrew Bible and, in a wider sense, all the teachings of Judaism. 

"Learning Torah is not necessarily just for a religious person. We're trying to get away from the whole stereotype," Frieberg said. "Anybody who comes to our events is going to find themselves around warm, friendly people."

For spring break they are organizing a group trip to New York City for eight days, March 19 through the 26, for only $199 - which includes airfare, hotel and meals. 

The regular cost of a trip like this is estimated to be at least $1,000. The trip includes visits to tourist spots, classes on Jewish philosophy, mysticism and personal growth and free time to explore the city. 

CLE has a weekly class called Wisdom Wednesdays at 12:30 p.m. offered free of cost in Room 166 at the UP Green Library. This class is run in conjunction with the Jewish Law Students Association. The class is interactive and focuses on Judaism's perspective on practical life issues. 

Off-campus, there is also a weekly series of classes at the Greater Miami Hillel located at the University of Miami called Partners in Torah.  Between 30 to 50 students attend. Jewish students from Miami-Dade College also attend CLE events. 

CLE's trip to Israel-taking place this summer-is a combination of learning how to access Jewish text and touring. Last year they sent 85 people. It's a three week trip starting May 14 through June 6 and is only open to Jewish students. The total cost of this trip is $499-which includes airfare, meals and accommodations. A ticket to Israel in the summer usually costs $1,200 from Miami. 

Touring will include sites such as Masada, Tiberias, Jerusalem and Safed and will be combined with Torah Learning. 

For more information about CLE, contact Rabbi Saj Freiberg at rabbifreiberg@gmail.com. Interested students can also visit www.thecle.com.

Headline: Greek members wait for houses
Author: Charlene Collazo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In the past, President Modesto A. Maidique has mentioned that FIU is striving toward that traditional college campus atmosphere, a goal that includes the completion of three fraternity houses.

Almost six years have passed since three out of the five fraternal organizations - Tau Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Sigma Alpha Mu - secured land along Fraternity Row for their Greek housing, but there is yet to be any progress or construction under way.  

In September 2001, the first fraternity house on-campus - Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI) - was constructed into what is now Fraternity Row along the main entrance of 107th Ave. and S.W. 16th St. Following the members of FIJI, Pi Kappa Alpha (PIKE) opened its doors to all their members in the summer of 2005.

"Planning to build a house on-campus can be a hefty financial burden on any organization. There is architectural designs to review and lots of money to fundraise. It is basically a slow progression with a lot of work and dedication," said Michael Adkins, president of TKE.  

In hopes of following the footsteps of PIKE and FIJI, TKE has been working hard to achieve the construction of their house through alumni fundraisers and housing campaigns such as the "Building Brotherhood" campaign. 

Since August 2005, their efforts have helped raise $65,000.  

"Alumni support has helped the chapter tremendously," Adkins said.  In the meantime, FIU will be convening with all three organizations to discuss any progress.  

According to Hilda Bernard, graduate student assistant at Campus Life, the University is supportive of these [Greek] organizations building their houses as soon as possible.

However, funding and building a Greek house is not an easy task.

First, the Greek organization must consider the huge price tag it brings such as FIJI, whose home valued at almost $2 Million. 

Second, getting the resources to actually pay and start building the house is time consuming.  

Andrea Gaspardino, associate director of Campus Life and Greek Life advisor, described the process in which each organization is responsible for securing their own funds for their houses, whether it is through private bank loans, fundraising or alumni giving. 

"As of right now, Sigma Phi Epsilon is going through a challenging process of getting those funds for their house through private loans," she said.  

Sigma Phi Epsilon had a ground breaking ceremony almost a year ago to celebrate the opportunity of having a house on-campus.  

The ceremony took place on Fraternity Row where their future house would sit, next  to PIKE.  

Sigma Alpha Mu is another organizations who awaits their future house. 

In the early 1990's, they would rent out a warehouse in order to conduct meetings and host most of their chapter events.  

"The houses will be able to give the campus that collegiate fraternity row kind of feel," Gaspardino said. "It will help these fraternities conduct positive chapter events for the FIU community and sort of offer a different dynamic within fraternity Greek life." 

Some people question why sororities do not have houses.

"The reason why sororities have no house is really driven by the cost and liability issues," Gaspardino said.  

But, there is an alternative to sorority houses, and that is suites. 

Many colleges around the country such as University of Miami and Penn State University are dedicating buildings just for sororities so they can have a space to call their own without the trouble of finding a piece of land for each organization.  

"I think we could do something about it [suites]," Gaspardino said. "I would need to find out who we start with and remember in the end we will need money."  

Phi Sigma Sigma's departed member, Janelle Bertot, who passed away approximately one-year and a half ago, was the last hand-picked Housing Chair for FIU's Panhellenic Council and worked toward getting suites for sororities.

"As a council, we can make the decision of bringing back a housing chair," Gaspardino said.

Headline: French cafe offers authentic treats
Author: Lalinda De La Fuente / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It may have taken Paul 116 years to reach the shores of the United States from France, but here he is, bearing sweet confectionery gifts, delicate French fare and baskets of carefully crafted warm breads.  

Alright, Paul may not actually be a man with French baked goods and snacks in tow, but I can say that Paul is a North Miami Beach and Aventura bakery and café that is ready to offer you a taste of France right here in your own backyard.

According to a history brochure provided by the restaurant, Paul boasts a network of over 300 top quality bakeries throughout the world. Paul tea-rooms across the globe, from London to Tokyo, cater to more than five million customers each month; quite impressive for a small bakery and café that began in Lille, France.

Paul's North Miami Beach location sits nestled in a nearly new strip mall named Biscayne Commons next to the Biscayne Bay  Campus. The choice can be made to enjoy your food inside or out.  

At lunchtime the outside tables are generally crowded, with individuals enjoying their light yet tasty lunches while basking in the Miami sunlight.

Once settled within the confines of Paul, the rustic and earthy ambiance whisks you away to a Parisian street corner. Bakery cases filled with sugary confections will distract you as you eat your meal.  

The staff, all clad in white chef uniforms, is very friendly and helpful complementing the French café experience.

Before 11 a.m. on weekdays and 2:30 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, you can grab a freshly made omelet in nearly the same amount of time as it takes to wait in line for an omelet sandwich at Burger King.

Paul's non-breakfast menu is quite expansive, ranging from unique sandwiches to traditional French quiches. Their Quiche Lorraine features cheese and ham and is served with a healthy side of mixed gourmet greens tossed in Paul's signature flavorful vinaigrette. 

The most desirable aspect of Paul's sandwiches is that you get to experience their fresh baked bread.  

Their oven-baked Croque Monsieur features cheese coupled with turkey or ham on their celebrated fresh, milk-white bread which, unlike typical white bread, carries with it a rich taste and thin golden crust.

After 5 p.m., Paul adds to its menu a couple more tasty creations. Their Crêpe Florentine offers a thin, traditional French crêpe with chicken, spinach and mushrooms nestled inside. Their Crêpe Saumon presents an alternative to chicken with its Scottish salmon, cream and chive filling.

One could easily move from a dinner crêpe to a dessert one. Their crêpes, sprinkled with powdered sugar, can be filled with apricot or strawberry jam but the chocolate choice is a must try. If you're ready to splurge, freshly whipped cream can be added to top of you're traditional French creation.

The tarts at Paul are some of the most scrumptious of dessert choices.  

Their tarts offer fresh fruit inside a crumbly pie-like crust over light and savory custard. The fruit ranges from large red strawberries to granny smith apples to raspberries covered in a sweet, clear glaze. Their chocolate or coffee éclairs are a rich but tasty splurge, a definitive try at Paul.

Paul's coffee, all roasted in Italy, is simple and tasty. Their frothy cappuccino created a perfect end to my meal. If it's cold coffee you're after, try one of their frappe drinks. The rich mocha frappe doubles as an end-of-meal coffee and dessert. But who's to say you can't enjoy both?

If you find yourself at the Aventura Mall, Paul also has a location there. Although generally more crowded than their North Miami Beach counterpart, it still presents tasty meals and appetizing baked goods in a similar atmosphere with similar service.  

Whether it's a quick and healthy meal you're after or a sweet tooth fix, Paul offers both (and everything in between) at reasonable prices coupled with quick and friendly service all in a rustic French café atmosphere.

Meals for restaurant reviews are paid for by the reviewer and the restaurant is not notified in advance of the critic's presence.

Headline: American Heritage teaches diversity, culture
Author: Maria Chercoles / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
What is it to be an American? This is what American Heritage week, from March 13-16, hopes to answer by offering different activities that will teach and reinforce diversity and tolerance among students. 

According to Bill Buchanan, Student Programming Council president and American Heritage chair, the event will be a learning experience.

"It is an opportunity to celebrate the diversity of [the] American life, food and culture, as well as having fun," Buchanan said. "[Past] celebrations have been exceptionally awesome. I hope to surpass that feeling this year." 

American Heritage week plans to enlighten students on America's immigrant past. 

This year's highlight will be a comedy show starring Nick Swardson with an opening act by Jim Florentine on March 16. 

Some events planned for the week include an opening reception, a southern cuisine picnic, a karaoke night and line dancing lessons. 

Also, Walk the Line, the movie about famous country and rock musician Johnny Cash, will be shown while Shorty's will provide a barbeque dinner. 

"We are excited about the comedy show and the dinner and movie since they are the biggest events we are programming," said sophomore Sophia Del Zoppo, Buchanan's right hand person. "We expect lots of FIU students to show up." 

The celebration of American Heritage in FIU began as part of the original Spring Culture Fest organized every year by SPC; from there, it was broken into different heritage celebrations. 

 "It started and continues because we are such an eclectic school, where our students cultures are all different [and] we attempt to spotlight that [difference] throughout the year," Buchanan said.

Students understand the need for a festival that celebrates America's culture, especially because it's a mix of so many others.

"Some people feel as if their cultures might be disappearing by being exposed to American … factors such as McDonald's, Tom Cruise movies and Hip Hop music," said senior Pedro Ross. 

"[However] the best aspect of being in America is the eclectic nature of the country. There is rarely a case in which we feel threatened by the introduction of a different culture," Ross said. 

"If anything, it makes us stronger to be able to [integrate] a new culture. It broadens us and makes us unique." 

Whether you are a third generation American or you and your parents were born somewhere else, this event is open to anyone. 

SPC hopes to teach students something about the United States they didn't know. 

"Being a 'real white guy' in Miami, this is one of the times where I am able to showcase my culture and share it with the people of Miami as much as they have shared with me," Buchanan said.

Subheadline: Footwear classifies lifestyle, status for students
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For college students shoes can be a source of identity. An accessory that identifies who they are. This is the case for freshman Jaime Martinez.

"My shoes match my laid-back personality. Sneaker brands like Adidas and Fila are my favorites," Martinez said. "Whenever I'm hanging out, I want to be comfortable and wearing something that best represents me."

The different shoe styles available at retail stores allow consumers to choose the footwear that best expresses their personalities. Whether they prefer casual sneakers or something with a little more flair, buyers can find the right footwear at their local shoe store.

Rene Menendez, a sales associate at shoe retailer Journeys, expressed his feelings about the different types of people who purchase shoes at the store.

"We get all sorts of personalities buying shoes at our store. All the skater kids come here to buy Vans and Etnies shoes while the gangster types buy Timberland boots or Dr. Martens," Menendez said. "I already have an idea of what kind of shoe customers are going to buy when they walk into a store. Their appearance gives them away."

Shoe companies often use advertisements in media outlets to convey particular messages about what type of people wear their shoes. As a result, different personality types tend to stick with certain trusted brands. For example, the assumption that emo's love Converse.

This tendency for consumers to continue buying from the same shoe companies has led shoe brands to become synonymous with various social groups. 

"When I look into the latest skating magazines, I see tons of advertisements for shoes associated with skating. Each ad tells me why a particular skate shoe should be picked over another one," said senior Daniel Medina. "Most of the time, the different shoe ads use well-known skaters to persuade people to buy their shoes. According to the ads, I'm not a true skater unless I wear a particular shoe."

Among the most well-known shoe brands for skaters are Vans, Adio and Etnies. Because of their image and their reasonable prices that normally range from $39.99 to $69.99, these shoe brands have garnered much popularity from the skating scene, but they are also hated by some hardcore skating enthusiasts.

"Whenever skaters walk into the store, I always show them the skating shoes we carry such as Vans and Adio. Sometimes, a hardcore skater comes in and asks for some brand we don't carry and starts trashing our selection," Menendez said. "It's all about the particular image surrounding the shoes."

While skaters cling to their respective brands, other social groups, such as preps, stick with their respective types of shoes. Steve Madden, Diesel and Bottesini are commonly seen on the feet of teenagers who tend to dress more conservatively. 

These shoes are typically not found at traditional retailers such as Foot Locker and The Athlete's Foot, and they range in price from $69.99 to as much as $109.99.  

Timberland, Phat Farm and Ecko are often worn by a more urban and street-wise crowd. These brands can be found at affordable or expensive prices depending on the retailer and the shoe model. 

Such shoes hold a reputation of being familiar representations of street life.

"Some brands are marketed to strike a chord with youths. Every time I see anything Ecko-related such as shoes, I think it expresses my personality as a street-wise kid better than any other brand," said freshman Armando Gomez.

Even though shoe brands have become representative of various social groups, some people still do not see why a shoe's brand is so important.

"If a certain group wears a specific shoe brand, it doesn't mean that you have to wear it too. All that should matter is your comfort," said sophomore Sherisse Lewis.
