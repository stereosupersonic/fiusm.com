Headline: Founding journalism dean set to resign
Author:  Vinora Murdock-Hamilton / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Journalism and Mass Communication Dean J. Arthur Heise, has announced his resignation effective at the end of the 2002-2003 school year. 

"I made my decision in June but held back on the announcement until faculty members had an opportunity to hear it from me instead of a memo or an e-mail," he said.

Heise, 63, said he is waiting until the end of the current school year because he wants to ensure that the transition to a new dean will be a smooth one. 

He said he has been at FIU for almost three decades.  He is leaving to persue personal projects.

"This is a chance for me to decompress, to smell the roses," Heise, a sports car enthusiast, said. "In the 28 years that I have been at FIU I have never taken a sabbatical." 

He also plans on writing a book.

 "This one will describe my experiences when I first came to the United States in 1953 and also the great effort that I made to regain the home my family lost when the Red Army descended on the suburbs of Berlin in 1945."

Heise has already written two books: "Minimum Disclosure: How the Pentagon Manipulates the News," in 1979 and "The Brass Factories: A Frank Appraisal of West Point Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy" in 1969. 

He has also published numerous articles and co-authored the "Annual FIU/Florida Poll" which is a tool used by public officials and business people to help determine the direction of the state and to learn more about the opinion of residents.

Before assuming leadership of SJMC, Heise, a former reporter and editor with the Buffalo NY News and the Associated Press in Berlin, served twice as chair of the Department of Public Administration. He also founded the Institute for Public Opinion Research and aided in the foundation of what is now known as the College of Health and Urban Affairs.

SJMC Associate Dean Dr. Lillian Kopenhaver has worked with Heise since he came to FIU in 1974.   

"Dean Heise is a forceful leader who always had a strong vision," Kopenhaver said. "He worked hard to ensure that the School of Journalism developed a strong professionally-oriented program that would prepare students for work in any aspect of the mass communication industry." 

Under Heise's guidance, FIU developed a journalism program that is ranked in the top  25 percent of the nearly 400 accredited programs in the country. 

Six graduates of SJMC have participated in works that captured journalism's coveted Pulitzer Prize; one of them, Miami Herald's columnist Liz Balmaseda, winning it alone.

"No one else could have taken a journalism program this far in terms of national reputation in such a short period of time," Mike McQueen, SJMC Journalism Department chair, said. "FIU has graduates working as top editors and news directors at some of the finest media outlets in the country." 

McQueen said this is the result of Heise's vision that FIU, a state-funded institution with a high minority population, can compete with older and more well-known schools in the country.

Provost Mark Rosenberg says the loss of Heise will definitely be felt throughout the school.

"The dean has fulfilled every promise that he made to us, and his shoes will be hard to fill," Rosenberg said.

Heise said he is satisfied with the work he has done for SJMC.

"Six months after accepting the role as head of the school I knew that we either had to discontinue the program or turn the school into a first class institution with national recognition," he said.

Once the decision was made to keep the school open, the dean and his faculty set out to ensure three things: SJMC must attract the top minority students in the state, the school must be professionally oriented, and the school must gain national recognition.

"Our students now have a wonderful opportunity to acquire the skills needed to compete with others in the business," Heise said. "I am happy that I was able to make a small contribution to that." 

In 1988, SJMC was awarded FIU's largest federal grant â€“ $13.5 million for a 10-year Latin American Journalism Project. 

These funds are distributed in an effort to bolster the quality of journalism in Central America and have helped to establish a self-sufficient journalism training center in Panama. 

"This grant was a direct consequence of Dean Heise's leadership and entrepreneurial efforts," Rosenberg said. 

Department of Advertising and Public Relations Chair Pat Rose said Heise is a wonderful human being with a strong sense of fairness, one who is always willing to hear both sides of a story.

"The dean has always been supportive of the department of Advertising and Public Relations considering that his background is that of a journalist," Rose said. "He is always open to ideas presented by the faculty, and, above all, he is genuinely concerned about the students."

"The dean is a teacher and a mentor who spent time with me and encouraged me," Jasmine Kripalani, a graduate of SJMC and a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter for The Miami Herald, said. 

The resignation of Dean Heise comes as a surprise to many students. Some feel that SJMC has not done a good job of keeping students abreast of the things that are happening within the school.	

"We have been so busy working to ensure that the school continues to succeed that we sometimes forget to tell our story," Heise said. "I have a [student] advisory committee that keeps me up-to-date on the things that are happening in the classrooms, and we are improving our website to provide better information."

Heise said he feels that one of the drawbacks to this communication is the fact that a majority of the students come to school and leave immediately for work or other activities.

"There is great value in being able to spend time over a cup of coffee with a professor," the dean said. "I encourage students to work as little as possible and spend more time on their education."

 Michelle Walker, a senior in the print journalism track, expressed concern about the effect that the dean's departure will have on the school. 

"There have been a number of changes to the journalism program over the years that I have been here," she said. "Does this mean that more changes will be underway?" Walker said.

"Change is inevitable, but we are working hard to make sure that the impact on students is minimal," Heise said.

A search for Heise's successor will commence in late October after the completion of the journalism re-accreditation review.

How will the decision be made as to who replaces  Heise?

"We plan to meet with faculty and students, and get them involved in the process," Rosenberg said.

Headline: Antsy "Igby" follows familiar pattern
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;

If I started drawing cartoons about a lovable rodent called Hickey House and his buddies Ronald Ruck and Poofy the ambiguously human dog, I would have the Disney people swoop down on me faster than you can say "copyright infringement." So how come we don't see the J.D. Salinger goons bust kneecaps every time a second-rate Holden Caulfield wanders his way across the suburban landscape?

That's one of the questions raised by director Burr Steers' "Igby Goes Down," the others being: "Goes down on who? And why was this edited out of the movie?" I would have paid to see Kieran Culkin, (heck, any of the Culkin brothers) assume the altar boy position, if only as karmic payback for "Getting Even with Dad." No, Macaulay, I will never forgive you.

Kieran, a younger, perhaps even smarmier version of Macaulay, plays Igby, a sarcastic military school drop-out who runs away from his delightfully insane family into a life of, well, avoiding life. Igby constructs his existence around his uncanny ability to stay away from responsibilities, adulthood and authority figures. These include Susan Sarandon, who does her best Gloria Swanson impersonation as Igby's mom, and Ryan Phillipe as Ollie, Igby's insufferable older brother. 

Phillipe, who may well be Hollywood's gayest straight man, plays it so effete that it's hard to think of him as a character; he's more like an actor who is amused by the character he's supposed to be playing. 

Similarly, Jeff Goldblum plays Igby's landlord, D.H., with a constant smirk; Goldblum is one of our most disconcerting actors, because he always reads his lines as though he were miles above the script.

 If he were anyone but Jeff Goldblum, one could say he was too cool for the material, but this may be the first time that the words "too cool" and "Jeff Goldblum" have been put together in a sentence.

D.H. has a mistress (played by Amanda Peet) who almost inexplicably takes Igby under her wing, only to fall away from him on a heroin daze that sends Igby into the arms of Sookie Sapperstein (Claire Danes). 

Danes' character, although played sincerely enough, feels like a collection of quirks strung together, so much so that when Sookie commits a shocking betrayal, it's hard to tell exactly why she's doing it, because she's such an undecipherable mess.

This review is sounding harsher than I intended it to be, and that may well be because "Igby Goes Down" is one of those rare movies that makes you care for people you actively dislike. 

It's an undeniably smart, funny script, and yet I never once felt like first time writer-director Burr Steers was a talent to be reckoned with, but rather that, the elements of the movie (the script, the acting, the cinematography) had luckily come together into an above average film. 

Both Igby and Holden wade through a world of casual wealth, casual sex and casual living, as though life were just an all right way of killing time until something better comes along. 

The main difference, though, is that "Catcher in the Rye" was ultimately about the impossibility of holding on to innocence. "Igby," on the other hand, is about the undeniable advantages of being emotionally dead. And that lack of sympathy I find hard to stomach.

Headline: FIU holds hearings on fee hike
Subheadline: Increased fee to pay for new services, labs
Author: Christina Kent/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Public hearings to discuss a proposal to upgrade the Health Care and Wellness Center facilities and services will be held in mid-October. The plan, which was first discussed in September, calls for a $10 increase in the current health fee.

"The buildings are quite busy and overburdened," UP's SGC Comptroller Samir Qureshi and voting member of the fee committee said. "Facilities are being used by the students to their capacity."

Money generated from the increase would go toward the construction of a $3 million, 15,877 square-foot expansion to be joined by a walkway to UP's 10-year-old Health Care and Wellness Center. A full-service pharmacy and Women's Health Clinic would be included in the new two-story building.

At BBC, interior renovations on the existing Wellness Center would begin as soon as possible, with plans for a new building to be added in the future, Health Care and Wellness Center Director and premier planner of the proposal Robert F. Dollinger, MD. said.

"We've taken great strides not to increase the health fee on a regular basis," Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs and Health Representative for the fee committee John Bonanno said. The last fee increase was $8 for the 1999-2000 school year.

Currently, FIU's $44 health fee is the second lowest in the state, compared to Florida Gulf Coast University's fee of $35.50. University of Florida, Florida State, University of South Florida and University of Central Florida all have 2002-2003 health fees over $90. The increase would rank FIU â€“ the only university in Florida to have two wellness centers â€“ well under the state's average university health fee of $73.37. 

"The quality and services of our health facilities are just as good as other state universities that have a much higher fee," Dollinger said. 

The fee increase will help to alleviate an ongoing backlog of services, explained Dollinger, the primary care physician for the UP center. Right now, the waiting period for a routine physical is about three weeks and there is an occasional one to two day delay for acute ailments. The expansion, estimated to be completed in January 2004, would allow the center to service more students in less time.

"If the expansion will make services more efficient and quicker, then the fee increase is not much of a burden on me," sophomore history major Yves Fleurent, said.

Stocked with over-the-counter and prescription drugs, the new pharmacy would also have a full-time registered pharmacist.

"As it grows, this will be a site where students can hold internships, get training and have employment opportunities for their health-related majors," Dollinger said.

A separate Women's Health Clinic would play a vital part within the expanded Health Care and Wellness Center. Services most commonly requested by patients concern female health issues such as birth-control options and PAP exams.

The fee increase will also cover staffing for the clinic and other areas of the center, including medical professionals, specialists, support personnel and technicians. There are also plans to purchase new lab and computer equipment.

UP sees about 21,000 students and BBC sees about 6,350 annually at their wellness facilities. Services currently scattered about UP would also be consolidated into the new two-story building. Counseling and Psychological Services and the Victim Advocacy Center would make the move.

Students who live on campus would have an added benefit because the new building is a short walking distance away.

 "Its a good deal for just [$10] a semester," music education major Joe Vasquez said.

Christina Abuchaibe, senior and biology major said, "I don't agree with the fee increase until I see tangible results."

Open-forum hearings geared toward answering students' questions and listening to their opinions will be held at both campuses in the coming days: on Oct. 9 at 3 p.m. in Panther Square at Biscayne Bay, and on Oct. 16 at 2:30 p.m. in GC 150 at University Park. 

"This is a great opportunity for students to get involved and have input in the school before a decision is actually made," Qureshi said.

The eight voting members of the University Fee Committee, consisting of the student government presidents and comptrollers from both campuses and four university directors, will hold their vote following the UP student hearing. If passed, the proposal would then move on to the Board of Trustees.

Headline: Council bestows professor with award
Subheadline: Award winning professor sits on four editorial boards
Author: Asra Jawaid/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Last Friday morning the Council of 100, one of FIU's most distinguished advocacy groups, bestowed its annual Outstanding Professor Award upon Dr. Mira Wilkins, a professor of economics at FIU for the past 25 years.

Wilkins has taught at FIU since 1976. At the beginning of her academic career she was intrigued by history but this fascination slowly evolved into a passion for economic and business history. After earning her doctorate from Cambridge University, England in 1957, she went on to teach at several different institutions.

These include Columbia University, Union College, Smith College, the University of Massachusetts and finally FIU where she has been teaching since 1976. 

Courses she has taught include those covering economic and business history, the world economy, and multinational corporations. 

To date, Dr. Wilkins has written six books: "The History of Foreign Investment in the United States to 1914," 1989; "The Maturing of Multinational Enterprise: American Business Abroad from 1914 to 1970," 1974; "The Emergence of Multinational Enterprise: American Business Abroad from 1914 to 1970," 1970; "American Business Abroad: Ford on Six Continents," 1964 and "Foreign Enterprise in Florida: The Impact of Non-U.S. Direct Investment,"1979.

The as-of-yet-unnamed sequel to "The History of Foreign Investment in the United States to 1914" will be published sometime next year. 

Her articles, which cover topics ranging from those on the history of British, French, Swiss and Japanese multinational enterprise to comparisons between countries that are home and host to multinational enterprise, have appeared in magazines such as Business History Review and Business History. 

She has also contributed to two volumes of work: "The Free-Standing Company in the World Economy, 1830-1996" (1998) where she wrote two of the sixteen chapters included in the book and "The Growth of Multinationals," 1991, where she wrote the introduction, summation and seven of the republished articles. 

A past president of the Business History Conference, today Wilkins serves on the editorial boards of Business History Review, Business History, Enterprise and Society, EH.net Encyclopedia, and The South African Journal of Economic History. 

She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and since 1996 a Fellow of the Academy of International Business. 

Her academic interests, which include but are not necessarily limited to lecturing at universities around the world, have taken her around the country as well as to 63 countries spanning every continent. 

Some of them include the College of William and Mary, University of California at Los Angeles, Oxford University and Cambridge University, both in England, and the University of Tokyo in Japan. 

Her work has also led her to Belgium, France, Switzerland, Denmark, Argentina and South Africa.  

"Each country has provided me with a different set of insights and I've enormously enjoyed traveling," Wilkins said. "It gives me a feel for what I'm studying."

This is the third year that the award has been given by the council to an outstanding faculty member at FIU. 

The members of FIU's Council of 100 represent South Florida's top business and civic leaders. By participating in this association, these members set an example and encourage others to take an interest in FIU's future as well. 

Each year the Council makes a monetary contribution to the University's financial security. 

Professors who have previously won all three-university awards-for research, teaching and service-are automatically considered for the Council of 100 award. Department chairs may forward additional names for consideration as well. 

This year's nomination committee was made up of Richard Zelman, Morris Hollander and Michael Baird. 

Membership in the Council of 100 organization is possible with an invitation by one of two people: FIU President Modesto Maidique or the council chair. The 2002-2003 council chair is Jeffrey Herstmyer. 

After opening remarks by Maidique and Provost and Executive Vice President Mark Rosenberg, faculty awards of excellence were handed out in the following categories: teaching, faculty and creativity, service, advising and part-time professors.  

Following the presentation of these and the Council of 100 Outstanding Faculty Award, Dr. Stanley Fish, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago delivered a keynote address.

Headline: Former Israeli president inaugurates study program
Subheadline: FIU becomes fourth American university to have Sephardic program
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Former Israeli President Yitzhak Navon received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree at FIU in a ceremony on Sunday.  The event also served to officially inaugurate The Navon Program for the Studies of Sephardic and Oriental Jewry, part of the Institute of Judaic and Near Eastern Studies at FIU.  

"It is very appropriate that this important new program be at an institution like FIU in South Florida. Given the fact that Sephardim are, after all, Hispanic Jews by origin, it's natural that the program would be located in one of the largest Hispanic and Jewish population centers in the world," President Modesto Maidique said.  

Yovel, a non-profit organization for the increased awareness of Judaic culture with a focus on Sephardic and Oriental Jewry, issued a $600,000 grant to FIU for the creation of the program.  The founders of Yovel chose to name the program after Navon, who served as president of Israel between 1978 and 1983, because of his status as the first person of Sephardic heritage to hold that office and his many contributions to the Sephardic community.  

"Sephardic" refers to Jews who originated in Spain or Portugal, but has been commonly used to refer to any Jews who are not Ashkenazi.  Navon's family has lived in Israel for over 300 years and can trace its ancestry back to the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492.  

"You have here a group of people who really contributed to Judaism greatly, but [were] never acknowledged for their contribution, and this is what we are going to do," Zion Zohar, director of the Sephardic Studies program said.  "We're going to educate, we're going to research, we're going to discover and uncover all that material and help people to be aware of these great contributors."

"I have always been convinced that the study of the Sephardic heritage could be of great benefit to understand better the nature of human beings and the complexity of the world they inhabit," Yovel President David Kadoch said.  

FIU is the fourth university in the United States to implement a program in Sephardic and Oriental Studies.  Although the program is now in its second year, the inauguration of the program was delayed until this year because of the events of Sept. 11.

Both Yovel and Navon commended FIU on its diversity and stated that as a reason for choosing FIU to host the program.  Navon recognized several of FIU's accomplishments but said "one of the more exciting aspects in my eyes is the wonderful diversity of the student body."

Before ending his speech, Navon commented on the current situation in Israel and around the world.

"Even as we battle against terror, I bid you to extend a hand in peace and hope to see adversaries do the same," he said.

He ended by reciting "A Box of Crayons," a poem about peace by a 10-year-old girl.

"I had a box of crayons . . . I had no red for the blood of the wounded; I had no black for the orphans' grief; I had no white for the faces of the dead. . . but I had green for the blossoms of spring; I had blue for brilliant heavens, and I had pink for rest and dreams.  So I sat down and drew peace."

Headline: Modern concepts of fashion styles promote freakishly thin body types
Author: Jane Eisner/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
The spring fashion collections that strutted down the runways in New York last week are, according to some of the snootier critics, an unimaginative throwback to the 1950s, evoking an era of pastel domesticity, illusory safety, even a kind of Eisenhower dullness.

The fashionistas will cluck and chatter and have their say; this is their moment, after all. When the rest of us bother to look at photographs of models in impossibly short shorts and scandalously see-through blouses, we are likely to see something else: 

Thin. 

Very thin. 

So thin that bones protrude and backsides disappear and every bodily shape seems airbrushed away. Even hair is as slender as spaghetti. 

When I think of the 1950s, I think of women who filled out their Peter Pan-collared blouses and bouncy, pleated skirts, seeking to equal Marilyn Monroe's generous curves. 

In today's revisionist fashion scene, the "retro" clothes look as if they could be worn only by women who've subsisted on naked lettuce and bancha twig tea for a month. 

The waif look is, unfortunately, not new in contemporary fashion and no stranger in a popular culture dominated by images of 90-pound actresses. 

But in perusing the latest runway photos, I realized that they looked chillingly similar to the pictures posted on pro-anorexia Web sites that have caused such concern in the mental-health community. 

These online societies of the starving are extolling a perverted vision of beauty and perfection that is only a few pounds shy of what paraded down last week's runways. You can see why eating disorders are so prevalent among a certain sliver of America. The glorification of thinness is reinforced at every turn. 

In a nation of affluence and abundance, there are now mini-societies of those who will not eat â€“ or will not eat very much, or will only eat Atkins, or Zone, or on odd days of the week. Where once such behavior was a personal secret, now it is a stylish form of group identity. 

"Diets have always been woven into the life of the image-conscious," wrote Kate Betts in last Sunday's New York Times, "but it used to be something you didn't admit _ like the model `sent away' to drop five pounds before she could work again. Now, diets are discussed openly, unashamedly, cheerfully. Having a diet is almost â€“ de rigueur."

There are important differences between the faddishness of the fashion set and the serious mental illness afflicting the 12 million to 13 million people â€“ mostly women â€“ who suffer from anorexia and bulimia. 

Staring at the pages of Vogue won't automatically turn someone anorexic. Nor will online sites infect a user the way that the bombardment of violent images on television may affect a child's behavior. 

But those who treat patients with eating disorders worry that the explosion of "pro-ana" (pro-anorexia) and "pro-mia" (pro-bulimia) sites can trigger dangerous feelings and behaviors among the vulnerable. 

"I wouldn't want the women I treat looking at these Web sites," said Ellen Davis, clinical director of the Renfrew Center in Philadelphia. "They push people to think, `If I can look like that, I will be what they are.' These sites are very destructive."

The photographs of skeletal girls and women are not the only disturbing features of these sites. Even worse is the way that anorexia â€“ which has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disease â€“ is viewed not as an illness but as a lifestyle, a religion, a source of comfort and even pride among those who believe they are strong enough to defy nature by suppressing hunger. 

Anorexia and bulimia were once isolating diseases. With the Internet, they take on the attributes of a cult. 

Eating-disorder organizations and other advocates have tried to disband this virtual cult by pushing the sites off mainstream venues such as Yahoo and AOL. But the Internet is a wiry adversary: Squash activity in one place, and it will pop up somewhere else. 

At a time when obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in America, it seems the ultimate irony that ever-younger victims of eating disorders are showing up in doctors' offices. Ironic, but understandable. 

The nation may consider itself an outsized political, military and economic power, but its vision of beauty is an extra-small. Sometimes I think the entire nation suffers from an eating disorder of one kind or another. We eat either too much, or not at all.

The fraternity, established in 1976, was suspended for allegedly engaging in an act of hazing that consisted of a paddling so severe, the student was left limping as a result of a swollen left leg.  

While hazing is publicly condemned by Greek organizations on campus and directly violates university rules on the subject, the events that prompted Phi Beta Sigma suspension show that hazing continues to occur. Given the level of secrecy present in many fraternities and sororities, it  can be difficult to tell if hazing occurs in a particular Greek organization.  

Take into consideration the fact that the student who fell victim to hazing was initially reluctant to report the incident, and the question then becomes: how long has this gone on? Moreover, how many other Greek organizations engage in this but have never been caught?  

Though hazing is often done as a rite of passage to create a sense of camaraderie between the "brothers" and "sisters," the serious and often deadly aspects of hazing are largely ignored by groups at universities nationwide.  

With such a serious threat to student safety, FIU's reaction was, at the very least, appropriate. However, considering the serious nature of the act, the university should take one step further to show it will not tolerate hazing of any kind, and seriously reprimand any group that is willing to inflict pain and humiliation on its members.

Winners

Dr. Mira Wilkins: With a degree from Cambridge and past teaching positions at universities ranging from Columbia to Smith, it's no wonder you won this honor. 

Miami Dolphins: Congrats on bouncing back with an impressive win over the Superbowl champion Patriots. Hopefully we can have the same success over the Broncos next week.

Red Dragon: With the tripe that's out now, it's no surprise you premiered at number one.  Let's face it, "Sweet Home Alabama" and "The Banger Sisters" could never compete with cannibals and gore.  

Losers

Phi Beta Sigma: And Greeks wonder why students don't believe them when they say hazing doesn't happen.  So let's put this in perspective, you pay money to have a group of guys spank you?  To each his own I guess.

Health and Wellness Fee: It seems like every semester there's an attempted fee increase of some kind by some group. Pretty soon we'll be paying more in fees than we do for classes.

Red Dragon: While you did premiere at number one, you're earnings did not measure up to those of "Hannibal" by a long shot.  Hopefully this is a sign that America's finally getting tired of this storyline.

Headline: Housing bill ridiculous attempt to swindle perks from students
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Two weeks back, The Beacon ran a story on how President Adrian Carter and Vice President Alexander Lewy of the BBC Student Government Council held a large meeting in order for students to voice their questions and concerns to the council.  

During this meeting, someone brought up something I'd never heard about (apparently others hadn't either): the housing bill.

The idea behind this housing bill is relatively simple. Carter and Lewy think it stinks that they have to drive to school from home every day for class and their SGC work. Thus, they proposed a bill through which  money that is not their own (i.e. student fees) pay for them to live on campus. To them, it's a win-win situation: they get to be on campus and save on gas, and students get representatives who can spend more time catering to their needs.

The Beacon disagreed, offering a negative reaction to the bill in both the In Our View editorial and the Winners and Losers section of the opinion pages. 

We wanted to know what made Carter and Lewy feel so darned special that they felt they deserved special treatment.

Last issue, we ran an answer, one from Carter and one from former BBC President Brian Dean Abramson. Abramson claimed "bringing these executives to live in a place that affords them better access to the focal points of their labors, greatly increases their ability to focus their time and energy exactly where it belongs: in service to the needs of their constituents." Carter said similarly, "Having one of the executive officers live on campus decreases travel time to and from the university and allows more time to serve the student population and promote community on campus and between campuses."

In other words, they want to spend more time on their constituents but on your tab, not their own. 

As for the rest of those letters, which you can read online on our website archives, they were nothing more than a pile of P.R. and filibustering in an effort to bombard you with so much information and make you so confused that you have no choice but to support the bill. After all, these people do so much for us, surely they deserve at least a place to stay.

They don't. First of all, they do get paychecks for their work: $10,000 a year. 

While it's hardly a boatload of money, this is a sacrifice they chose to make to be our representatives (and to be honest, I would love a sacrifice that came with a $10,000 annual salary). If they knew the hardship would be so, well, hard, they shouldn't have bothered taking the job. 

Do they do a lot of work for the students? Hell yes. I could never be an SGC rep. because of how much effort and time the job takes. Trust me, being a Production Manager for this newspaper isn't exactly easy, but it's probably a joke compared to some of the stuff they've got to do.

Again, this does not mean they deserve housing. The only argument Carter and Lewy can offer is insulting, because when you sum it up into four words, those words are "being SGC is hard." Lots of stuff is hard, you two. Quit the whining because you're no different than the rest of us. What about my friend who had to leave FIU because of the high cost of out-of-state tuition, the cost of campus residence (she had no other alternatives, unlike you) and the fact that she had no car so she couldn't get a job that was worth diddly anywhere within walking distance?

I hope they aren't implying that they are more important and deserving than her, just because they won a glorified popularity contest that grants them a paycheck to represent students. 

The worst part are the claims by Abramson that the SGC president and vice president are entitled to housing because the President of the United States is. That's downright laughable. 

How big of an ego can they possibly have to compare themselves to the president of the United States? Stop deluding yourselves, as special as you may think you are, you are nowhere near that special.

If we were to take this logic as it's offered, anything that was "in the best interest of the students" should be approved. Very well. 

Therefore, I would also like to propose a bill to the SGC: the helicopter bill. In this bill, both the president and vice president of SGC at BBC will be provided a helicopter and their own personal helipads (we can just take away some parking; no one will mind). 

This way, they can be anywhere in Miami within 15 minutes max. Sound ridiculous? So does this bill.

Now, I'm not saying I have a problem with Carter, Lewy or SGC itself. Carter's letter featured a list of great accomplishments, all signs of how SGC is doing its best part to serve the student body. 

But this housing bill is a kickback more than anything else. 

Carter and Lewy must increase their visibility if they get free housing, otherwise we'll have no way to prove or enforce that they use their time on campus to better handle their responsibilities.

Headline: Rights ordinance not yet out of woods
Author: Paul R. Bishop/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Tuesday, Sept. 10 has passed us. With it passed an election. With that election passed an opportunity for Miami's population to decide upon its values and principles and, by extension, its fate.  

On the ballot was a question that sought to remove any mention of sexual orientation from Miami's civil rights bill.  That question was decided in favor of civil rights â€“ the bill remains as it has since 1998 â€“ though it did so by the slimmest of margins. The lackluster voter turnout and misinformation circulating among those who did vote made the race dubious.  

I was picketing that day.  As a volunteer for No To Discrimination/Save Dade, I ran among parking cars, handing out palm cards and asking voters to please fight discrimination.  I ran, sweat, got drenched in rain, and ruined my favorite pair of pants in the mud.  

I did so believing that the ordinance would be revoked despite the efforts of many principled and dedicated people.  I ran, out of shape though I am, because I cared about what I was fighting for.  

This is what being a citizen means â€“ having an opinion and expressing it.

Two weeks prior to that day, I was scanning a list of names and phone numbers, calling people who had chosen to volunteer for Save Dade. The numbers I dreaded the most were those in South Beach.  

I rarely had a productive conversation with anyone in that area. Most of those I called were happy to attend club events in honor of Save Dade, but were not interested in doing any actual work to defend their rights.  While I noted that the vast majority of those I met at Save Dade were gay, I also noticed that astoundingly few of them lived in Miami.  

The most active participants came from Colorado, Tampa, and Philadelphia.  A political struggle about Miami, concerning Miami's citizens, was being staged and fought largely by those who did not live in Miami.  The revelation that allegedly Take Back Miami â€“ the fundamentalist group that committed fraud to get Question 14 on the ballot â€“ was funded and controlled by outside entities that can still not be traced made the revelation that much more certain and poignant.  I was enraged when I learned that Question 14 was probably not even the idea of a Miami citizen.  

To make matters worse, most people I spoke to were unaware of the issues on the ballot. When I explained the issue, they seemed not to care. I was upset that Miami did not care enough to get involved in its own affairs.  I was upset that very few of my friends cared to fight for their rights. I was upset that Miami needed help from outside to determine its political future.  

Fundamentalism â€“ that same force that lynched African Americans until Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. made it clear that such obvious immorality could not be tolerated â€“ nearly won on Sept. 10.  That ugly, evil force has not yet backed down.  Take Back Miami has filed lawsuits claiming that only voter fraud could be responsible for the election outcome.  

A new petition is being formed. Hispanic radio is being flooded with anti-gay political ads and propaganda.  

Meanwhile, bars, clubs and gyms are in full attendance and are doing well in South Beach.  There is very little talk of human rights or politics there. I do not mean to imply that there is anything wrong with fun or enjoying life.  I merely make the point that it is possible to enjoy life only when freedom has been fought for and secured.  There is no gay community in South Florida  as much as there is a loosely knit social scene. There is little mutual support and no organization.  

There is little passion for anything other than a good time. This is true of Miami in general â€“ even the fundamentalists here were not dedicated enough to think of organizing themselves.  

This is not a gay problem: it is a Miami problem.  The apathy in this place is a disease that is crushing us, making beneficial change or growth impossible. The task of getting Miami aware of its political issues and then involved in contending with them is astoundingly difficult.  

These battles waged, and all the noise they created, inspired little in the Miami population.  

This apathy and stagnation will spell our doom if we do nothing about it.  Learn about the issues and act.  

Otherwise, others will determine your future for you.

Headline: Childish reasons motivate Bush's stance toward Iraq
Author: Andrea Martini/ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Last week, walking swiftly past the television in my kitchen,  my eyes caught the image of President George W. Bush. I did not want to miss an opportunity for entertainment because I often mistake him for a comedian and forget that he really is the president.  As expected, President Bush was addressing the Iraq issue, but this time his clumsy comments and endless rhetoric only seemed funny for approximately five minutes.  I almost choked on the gulp of water I was drinking when I heard the president explain how we shouldn't forget that Saddam Hussein was the man who tried to kill his father.  

My stomach muscles contracted and laughter echoed throughout the kitchen.  After a few minutes, my outrageous laughter started to vanish and anger kicked in.  As a strong believer of democracy, I felt scorn towards the lack of leadership our President displays.

I remain impartial on whether or not an attack against Iraq is appropriate, but as someone who expects well-founded arguments from our political leaders, president Bush's remarks seemed completely pointless.

In the lowest possible attempt to gain support for war against Iraq, President Bush flaunts his personal grudges in the face of the American public as a valid reason for such an important decision as war. Bush's lack of objectivity, and his casual treatment of such a significant issue weakens the persuasiveness of his argument in favor of military effort.  

Why should his personal disdain for someone be relevant when making a decision to engage the country in war?  I understand that President Bush does not evoke the grandeur of a statesman, and that in order to make up for this deficiency, he attempts to establish common ground with people by appearing to be just another citizen.  

However, I do get offended when he underestimates the intelligence of the American public and presents us with ridiculous comments that ignore the duties of his position. 

So are we supposed to feel sorry for him and support war on Iraq because of some personal resentment that the president has not been able to dispose of in therapy?  Yes, I am sure Saddam Hussein wanted to kill former President Bush, but for that matter, Saddam would kill his own father, if he hasn't done so already.

If George W. Bush so strongly desires to get rid off Saddam Hussein for personal reasons, then maybe we can parachute him down into Baghdad in a Zorro outfit so that he can challenge the Iraqi leader to a duel. 

Or perhaps the president can convince Condolezza Rice and both Secretaries Rumsfeld and Powell to join him in a covert drive-by shooting operation to kill Hussein. Either plan will save us the embarrassment of sending American troops into Iraq to carry out an American vendetta to restore the honor of the Bush family. 

Bush makes a mockery of American foreign policy when he expresses personal sentiments as evidence for urgent action to remove Hussein from power. Still, he expects the United Nations to support him.  I am sure that with Bush's comment, Kofi Annan's decision to exhaust all diplomatic tactics before launching an attack will undoubtedly be met with more support on behalf of the international community.

Why would President Bush be senseless enough to discredit the objectivity, seriousness and validity of his argument?  Moreover, is his Cabinet so inept that no one can advise him in a more proper manner?  I strongly believe that this is not the case and that the president's decision to make such a comment is an independent choice, in which case, the rumored discrepancies between him and his Cabinet members are true.

It is hard to believe in the ideological principles of a rational democracy when the nation's chief executive figure, the president, appears to be completely unfit for the responsibilities of his office. I predict that, fortunately, this will be a one-term president.

Headline: Students win spots on Dolphin squad
Author: Erika Mayor/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
During a normal day these FIU students go to class and take exams just like any other student, but on Sundays you can find them with their hair down in Miami Dolphins' cheerleader outfits dancing for thousands at Pro Player Stadium. 

Pamela Silva, Adriana Souza, Cindy Iglesias and Sandra Sotolongo are four of 10 FIU students who made it into the cheerleading squad after competing against 200 girls from South Florida. Whether it is being in the Dolphins' calendar or dancing in the special team, these four girls stand out among the rest.

 Silva, 21, is a senior in the broadcast journalism track. She is in her rookie season with the Dolphins and was recently featured as Ms. October in the 2003 Swimsuit calendar.

 "The calendar is very tasteful and for all ages," Silva, who used to dance for FIU, said. She is also a member of Show Team, a special division of the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders. 

Souza, 22, is a third year veteran, Ms. November in the calendar and a Show Team dancer. She is a pre-med student and hopes to become a pediatrician. 

Sotolongo, a 21-year-old education major, is one of the co-captains and is also featured in the calendar. She has been on the squad for three years.

 Advertising major Cindy Iglesias dances for Show Team and appears on the sponsor page in the calendar. Cindy is a rookie, but she danced for the Miami Heat in the 2001 season. 

Souza, Sotolongo and Iglesias recently returned from Mexico City where they made an appearance on a popular morning talk show on "TV Azteca."

Silva has already made an impact on the squad.  

"She is a beautiful asset in all aspects," Dorie Grogan, Miami Dolphins cheerleaders director said; "Her smile makes you want to approach her."

Silva was born in Peru and came to Miami at the age of nine. She has been interested in broadcasting from a young age.

 "That's why I'm graduating so early. Since day one I was not going to change my major," Silva, who will be graduating next year, said.  

Silva manages to juggle her cheerleading with a full schedule of activities.  She is taking 12 credits and works 25 hours a week at the American Cancer Society as a patient service specialist. She said her hectic schedule has not interfered with her schoolwork. She keeps a 3.6 GPA.

 "It's all how you balance your time. Some people just can't handle it and get overwhelmed," she said.

On a normal day Silva will work in the morning until noon then go to school at the Biscayne Bay Campus. She aspires to be a sports broadcaster and believes the publicity from the Dolphins can help.

"It's all about contacts; there is media everywhere," said Silva, who is often approached by large media companies like Fox News to do promotions or television appearances for them.

Souza is originally from Brazil and is a full time student. She plans to graduate next fall and attend medical school at the University of Miami. Souza has been dancing since the age of five.

 "My best friend was on the squad and told me how much fun she was having so I decided to try out," Souza said. "I go to school in the morning and leave at 6 p.m. for practice." 

Souza said she considers school very important.

"You have to know what your priorities are," she said.

 Iglesias danced ballet for eight years then joined the cheerleading squad in high school. She takes nine credits and works part time at a talent agency. She said she feels she is handling the pressure of school life and cheerleading well.

"It's work but [dancing] relieves pressure," Iglesias said.

The squad practices three times a week in Davie, and when the Dolphins are home they have additional practice on Saturdays and Sundays. On most nights Show Team dancers finish practice at 10 p.m. When they are not at the games they are required to do countless appearances and rehearsals. 

These long practices give the girls the stamina they need to keep going during games and appearances.

Silva said that as long as you are conditioned you can dance for hours in 90 degree weather. 

Some of the girls get to travel around the country and the world. Silva will be visiting the troops stationed in Fort Hood, Texas at the end of the month and Souza will be appearing on "Caliente," a Spanish television show on Univision. 

 "All the girls are amazing cheerleaders and handle everything great while keeping their grades up," Assistant Coordinator Darlayna Campbell said. 

"There is a large variety of well-prepared girls," Silva said. "The Dolphins emphasize that all the girls are well-rounded students and professionals. There are pre-law students and a valedictorian." 

Actually, the Dolphins make it a requirement for each dancer to either be a full time student or have a job outside of the squad. The dancers receive $25 per game. 

"Thousands of girls wish they could have a spot on the squad," Souza said. "I would do it for free. The money is a bonus." 

 "People think that we aren't smart and this is our only job," Souza said. "I've had to explain to ignorant people that I consider this a hobby." 

Silva also thinks the stereotypes are false.

"It takes more than a pretty face. You have to have brains," she said

But not everyone sees the cheerleaders in a negative way. Many young girls see them as role models and want to learn everything about them, Souza said. 

"We all support her," Souza's brother and self-proclaimed number-one fan said, "I'm always at the games. I want everyone to know she's my sister."

Headline: Broadcast students help make Strock show
Subheadline: NBC gives students first break
Author: Alejandra Diaz/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When the seniors in FIU's broadcast journalism track signed up for their last class, News and Public Affairs Reporting, they were prepared to write scripts, report, tape, edit and present finished packages to their instructor and fellow classmates.

What they didn't know was that their course work would be a television show about the FIU football team, the person they would answer to, a WTVJ NBC 6 producer and their audience, South Florida.

The "Don Strock Show" airs weekly on Saturday mornings at 9:30 a.m. on WTVJ NBC 6, and features the latest FIU football highlights, game commentary and player statistics. Student involvement is showcased on the show with two segments featuring players and other FIU related news. 

Production starts with the students shooting FIU's football games. There, they pick the player to be featured on that week's show. They travel with the team and focus on the player of the week.

"The students are responsible for writing scripts, taping, doing stand-ins and editing any and all material to be aired on the show," show producer Kurt Jimenez said. 

All the taping and editing is done at FIU with cameras and editing equipment allocated to the class.

Jimenez makes a weekly trip to FIU in order to help students put the final touches on their featured segments. 

"It is my job to help the students make it look professional while keeping it entertaining and making sure it flows well," said Jimenez. 

Once the segment is edited for the last time, Jimenez puts it on tape and takes it to the NBC studios where the editing team later adds it to the show. 

"Our deadline is Wednesday afternoon, since the show is taped on Thursday and everything has to be ready so it can be aired on Saturday," Professor Teresa Ponte, who teaches the News and Public Affairs Reporting class, said. 

This project was born when WTVJ's news director Tim Gherat approached Journalism Department Chair Michael McQueen about a new opportunity that would allow students the chance to work on the "Don Strock Show." 

The students considered for the project were those enrolled in the News and Public Affairs Reporting class. After little deliberation, McQueen accepted the proposal and the new project was underway. 

In order to accommodate the show into the course, Ponte soon began revision  and implementation of a new course syllabus. 

"We had to rewrite the syllabus after NBC approached us with this opportunity because we knew it would benefit the students," Ponte said.

With a revised syllabus in hand, Ponte decided to give students the option to work on the show. 

"Although many choose to do the show, I wanted to give them an option because there are a few who are interested in covering other stories such as health or investigative reporting."

Students said they have put in countless hours of work and are doing their best to keep up with the pace of the show, while having fun.

"I think its great to be able to work on the show because it is aired in a large market and makes for a good resumÃ© builder," broadcast journalism senior Daniel Martin said. "Just saying that my packages have been aired in Miami will help me get a job in the future."

Martin said he has been on the sidelines of the Golden Panthers' games for three consecutive weeks, and is learning how to deal with players and sports personalities in general. He said that although it has been a lot of work, he is happy to be doing what he had always dreamt of doing as a career â€“ covering sports.

Broadcast senior Sharon Lima said the experience has been great for everyone since most other students rarely get the opportunity to be on the air.

Jimenez said he is happy to be working with the class and is pleased with the results.

"Overall it's exciting because they are doing a great job and the feedback from the network is great," he said. 

 "The benefits these students gain are that they get the same experience they would out in the professional world," McQueen said. "It's a good deal all around."

Headline: Fraternity suspended for hazing
Subheadline: Phi Beta Sigma pledges paddled
Author: Adriana Oliva/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. was the first fraternity established at FIU in 1979, and in 2002, it is the first and only fraternity to be suspended for hazing.  

On March 12, 2002, Sudhakar "Sudi" Chauakula, an FIU student, was allegedly paddled so hard that his leg was severely hurt. According to the police reports, the paddling took place in a warehouse near S.W. 87th Ave. No street number is known.

When Sudi's parents came home from vacationing on March 18, 2002, they noticed his son was limping and that his left leg was extremely swollen. Josepha Landress, Sudi's mother, asked him what happened, and he said he fell down some stairs on campus. 

According to Landress' FIU police witness statement, she claims that she overheard her son talking on the phone and saying, "I told her I fell down the stairs." When she questioned him this time, the story changed. He told her that he was hazed and that when he asked the brothers to stop paddling him, they did not. The brothers allegedly proceeded to paddle his right leg.

Landress and stepfather Larry Landress reported the problem to Student Affairs who then referred the case to Public Safety for further investigation.

The case was assigned to Lt. Alphonse Ianniello, who interviewed 15 people from May 20, 2002 until June 6, 2002. Among those people were Sudi, his parents, Janice Spann-Givens, the National Pan-Hellenic Council faculty advisor and approximately 12 brothers from the chapter. 

When Sudi was interviewed, he claimed that no hazing ever took place and that he had no knowledge of a warehouse. 

"We were never hazed or physically harmed in any way," Sudi stated in his police witness statement.

Sudi also mentions in his statement that the intake process guidelines were reviewed and several written exams were administrated.

Nine out of the 10 witness statements taken from new Phi Beta Sigma brothers and those going through initiation, claimed no knowledge of hazing or a warehouse on 87th Ave. where Sudi's incident supposedly happened. 

However, Kierre Hodges did come forth and admit to the hazing accusations.

Hodges said paddling on the buttocks and punching in several parts of the body by fraternity brothers took place.

When asked by Lt. Ianniello if he had ever been hazed, he said yes.

"Two or three times a week 20 to 30 hits with a paddle on the buttocks which took place at meetings. This took place from late January 2002 till February 2002, usually from 11 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.," Hodges said to the police.

Hodges also mentioned in his statement that he was not there the night Sudi was injured because he missed that meeting and that most of the pledge meetings took place at Andre Harriot's house, a Phi Beta Sigma brother and at a wooden area by Panther Hall.

Andre Harriot denied that there was hazing going on in the fraternity in his police statement. 

The investigative findings by Public Safety are as follows: Allegations of hazing by the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity could not be proved or disproved based on the victim and other brothers denying any of the events ever happened and that hazing was never seen or witnessed. The investigation could not reveal any criminal wrongdoing on part of the fraternity. 

Once the police were done with their investigation, they sent their reports to Karen Dlhosh, director of Judicial and Mediation Services. Dlhosh then asked Todd Sullivan, assistant director of Campus Life for Greek Affairs, to conduct a separate investigation. 

Ten students were interviewed. They ranged from new members, full members to students who did not finish the intake process. 

"There were both consistencies and inconsistencies with the answers made by the various students," Sullivan said in his Phi Beta Sigma investigation report.

Almost all of the people interviewed denied any physical activities or hazing had occurred. A non-member whose name was removed from report admitted that running, push-ups, sit-ups and staying in push-up position were required for all those who missed test questions. 

Running, push-ups, sit-ups and staying in push-up position are all considered forms of calisthenics. Calisthenics are considered physical activity, which is a violation of the student code of conduct under hazing.

Another interviewee whose name was also removed from the report claimed that he did witness paddling and punches and blows to the back and chest of pledges. He also stated that the full members told the pledges that their physical strength and mental ability were at test.

Although the police report and the Judicial and Mediation Affairs sanction letter said nothing about drinking and drugs, this particular non-member mentioned that they were forced to drink. However, the fraternity was not charged with alcohol violations.

When the investigation was finished, Sullivan then reported the findings back to Judicial and Mediation affairs.

Dlhosh met with Keith Betterson, former president of Phi Beta Sigma, on Aug. 8, 2002 in which they had a Summary Resolution meeting where Betterson accepted full responsibility to the violations Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. had committed. 

On Aug. 19, 2002, Dlhosh sent Betterson a sanction letter which describes all the violations and what actions have been taken on the fraternity itself.

The fraternity was charged with disruptive conduct [6.c.1], endangerment [6.e.1. and 6.e.2], harassment [6.i.1. and 6.i.2], hazing [6.j.1,2,3,4,6,10], and Student and Greek Organizations/Club additional offenses [6.u.5.a,b].

It was admitted that the chapter was responsible for the violations listed and that the fraternity participated in hazing activities such as paddling and calisthenics. Betterson has stated that he did not specifically know who had been paddling the new members.

Betterson was called several times, but calls were not returned to The Beacon.

As a result of its actions, the fraternity was suspended immediately until the summer semester of 2004. The fraternity is not allowed to participate in any Greek affairs, as well as NPHC activities and other on campus activities. 

"The organization is not guaranteed re-recognition at the end of such period of time but is guaranteed a review of the case and a decision regarding eligibility for re-admission," Dlhosh stated in her sanction letter.

The organization is also placed on conduct probation upon re-instatement and lasting through the end of summer semester 2006. The chapter president must meet with the assistant director of campus life and review chapter operations and progress, a list of active members must be provided at the beginning of each semester, and membership intake process has to be conducted by the Rho Sigma Alumni chapter only.

Only members who were new in the spring of 2002 will be allowed to bring back the organization and continue participation. 

Also, the chapter has to hold two formal educational programs regarding hazing, risk management and liability each semester while on probabtion and has to have 80 percent attendance. 

"If something positive comes out of this, it's that the group accepted full responsibility and that this will help other organizations know that these type of activities are unacceptable and not tolerated here at the University," Dlhosh said.

Headline: Technical difficulties plague Dashboard Confessional show
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Dashboard Confessional shows are more like expansive karaoke sessions than concerts.  Almost all of their fans know the words to every song, so at concerts, front-man Chris Carrabba basically has to play his guitar and look pretty (something he's very good at) while the audience takes care of the vocals.  

"If you come to one of my shows, you're kind of expected to sing along as loud as I do, and it's just really like a team effort," Carrabba says on the band's website. "It's almost organic how much the kids are involved. They are part of the band."

Last Tuesday, at the Dashboard Confessional concert at the Coral Sky Amphitheatre, the audience plunged head first into the lyrics pool.

With hands in the air, they belted out the words to "The Swiss Army Romance," a song that exposes the underbelly of the teenage desire to fit in. Considering the average age of the audience, many of them could probably relate to it: "We're not twenty-one/ but the sooner we are/ the sooner the fun will begin/ so get out your fake eyelashes/ and fake ID's/ and real disasters ensue/ It's cool to take these chances./ It's cool to fake romances/ and grow up fast." 

The band is pretty much comprised of Carrabba, a Boca Raton native, singing and playing electric or acoustic guitar.  On some songs he collaborates with his back-up band, which includes Mike Marsh, former member of the South Florida band The Agency, on drums.

  Dashboard Confessional has enjoyed a great deal of fame since I first saw them last year, when Carrabba actually seemed shocked to hear everyone reciting his songs.  

Though still relatively unknown, their popularity has soared, thanks to radio play and regular rotation of their "Screaming Infidelities" video, for which they won Best MTV2 Video at this year's MTV Video Music Awards. 

Though Dashboard's music appears to be morphing into something more and more commercial, utilizing electric guitars more frequently than their earlier songs &#8211; which were primarily acoustic without the aid of a back-up band &#8211; and becoming increasingly catchier, Carrabba is determined to affirm his loyalty to his fans.  Before playing "Screaming Infidelities," he told the audience: "So this song's on the radio; we're sorry."  

The audience didn't seem to mind. Nor did they appear to have a problem with the humid night air, the ticket price, the parking fee, the toll or the gas to get to West Palm Beach. 

What they did express concern over was the enormous amount of technical difficulties that occurred during the show.  

Sound problems especially plagued the performances of the opening bands: The Honorary Title, Hot Rod Circuit and Ash.  For some reason, Dashboard Confessional didn't encounter as many problems during their set.  

When Hot Rod Circuit was onstage, their monitors weren't working, so they couldn't hear themselves play.  Consequently, the singer was off-key in some songs.  In addition, one of the mics had no volume and the speakers were malfunctioning all night.  

These problems and more led to an overall reduction in sound quality, which was particularly disappointing at a venue like Mars Music Amphitheatre, which frequently hosts big-name bands such as Pearl Jam and Incubus.

Technical problems aside, Hot Rod Circuit, a punk band from Connecticut, and Ash, Irish pop-punkers whose lead singer Tim Wheeler described the band as "the Drew Barrymore of Irish pop," both put on good sets.  

But Dashboard Confessional was the only band that treated the audience to an encore. 

After playing "The Good Fight," they abruptly left the stage, with the obvious intention of returning.

Marsh was the first to return. He began playing the drums once again, this time with one hand, shaking a pineapple-shaped maraca with the other, teasing the audience before the rest of the band walked back onstage and entered into "For You To Notice."

Unfortunately, while the stage crew was pretending to pack up the equipment prior to the encore, they apparently messed it up because the sound problems were once again rampant. 

For the first couple of songs, Carrabba's voice was barely audible, even when he was bellowing at the top of his lungs.  

For their last song, Dashboard Confessional played a medley: a slowed down version of a Further Seems Forever (the band Carraba formerly played with) song combined with "The Bitter Pill" and at least two other songs. 

Carrabba ended the show simply by saying: "Thanks, we'll see you next time." As long as they don't play at the Coral Sky Amphitheatre again, he just might.

Subheadline: Joseph Martel / Staff Writer
Author: Great acting makes for moving Mile
&nbsp;
Losing a loved one is a tragic thing for anyone to go through, and when the loved one is your only child, it is a truly devastating experience. In all honesty, I find it hard to imagine anything worse. As morbid as it may sound, this is what makes "Moonlight Mile" so enjoyable. Director Brad Silberling ("City of Angels') gives us a very realistic look at a family dealing with their loss and how they manage to find comfort in each other. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie about tragedy that was this well done. It's also a heartwarming story about finding one's true love as well as finding one's true self. The best part is the acting: The cast is simply magnificent.

Although the exact date is not made aware to us, the story takes place somewhere in the early '70s in a small American town. It's the kind of place where everybody pretty much knows everybody else, so when a young woman is killed in a shooting at a local diner,  the whole town grieves. Oddly enough, the only two people that don't seem to be grieving, or at least pretending to grieve, are the girl's parents. At the reception, rather than feel devastated, the father, Ben Floss (Dustin Hoffman), appears nervous and the mother, Josephine "JoJo" Floss (Susan Sarandon), is more upset about the fact that everybody else is grieving for all the wrong reasons. 

The only one who seems really devastated is the young woman's fiancÃ©e, Joe Nast, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He's the new guy in town and tries very hard to cope with the loss of the woman he loved, but it's not easy, especially with her old girlfriends hitting on him. 

Although he doesn't feel right with it, he decides to follow the original game plan, which is to stay in town and go into the real estate business with Ben. He moves in with Ben and JoJo, but that just makes it harder for him because he's forced to listen to them bicker about everything. 

The worst of it all is the legal battle against his fiancÃ©e's murderer. Their lawyer (Holly Hunter) tells them his sentence may be too lenient because of a technicality and they have to work really hard if they want to get the justice they so rightly deserve, as if they haven't suffered enough. It doesn't look like Joe is able to get a grip on things, if his dreams are any indication. 

Then, just when things are as bad as they can get, he has a chance encounter with Bertie, who is the keeper of the local post office, the manager of Cal's Bar, and the sweetest tomboy you've ever laid eyes on. For obvious reasons, neither one wants to admit it, but there is an instant attraction between them. 

The last thing Joe wants to do is to disappoint the two people who were nice enough to take him in. However, the two can't fight their feelings for each other and they fall in love. This is where we learn the truth of Joe's relationship to the Floss' daughter and that it wasn't as perfect as people thought.

"Moonlight Mile" was inspired by the 1989 tragic death of Silberling's girlfriend, actress Rebecca Schaeffer, so I feel a little guilty pointing out the flaws. 

The film grabs your attention in the beginning and keeps it in middle, but you lose it towards the end. 

The climax isn't that climactic and when the story's done, you feel as if you're left hanging. Still, there's enough great acting and good dialog to keep you from walking out on the movie. 

Before it's finished, the dam breaks, and everyone who needs to cry, does.

Headline: "Tuck Everlasting" ponders immortality
Author: Kara Grant
&nbsp;
Ever wonder about the possibility of living forever? "Tuck Everlasting" is a breathtaking movie that explains both the pros and cons of immortality. One of the main messages in this film is that immortality isn't the best answer to life, but that the life we're given should be lived to the fullest. The Tuck family accidentally made a discovery that changes their lives forever, and allows them to enjoy life at a slower pace than others do.  

One day, Winnie Foster runs away from her restrictive parents who are no longer able to control the young, spirited girl she has become. She gets lost in the woods behind her house and comes across Jesse Tuck.  As she falls in love with Jesse and his family, she begins to see life in a different way and experiences happiness unlike she has ever known. 

Unfortunately, a mystery man is hunting for the Tuck family and the secret they have been harboring for many years. Because of him, the Tuck family is put in danger and Winnie is forced to make a decision.

This story is full of passion, joy, beautiful scenery and sadness. Based on the novel by Natalie Babbitt, "Tuck Everlasting" is a film that has a good message and touches your soul. Even though it starts out slow, the plot speeds up and by the end of the film you'll find yourself holding your breath and hoping that the main characters find a happy ending.  

After watching this movie, I immediately went to the bookstore in search of the novel it's based on.  After going to both Barnes & Noble and Borders I was amazed to find both stores were sold-out of their copies for this novel. 

 Apparently, this book has become a popular item.  The love this story describes, both familial and romantic, shows that sometimes the people we love most are the ones we have to learn to let go of.  That way, they can grow and discover what life has to offer: both the good and the bad.

I recommend this movie to people of all ages.  It's entertaining, funny, exciting, heartbreaking and suspenseful.  It shows that life is full of opportunities for exploring and taking chances and that it's worth every moment for those who are brave enough to discover the adventures.

Headline: "Red Dragon" scorches screen
Author: Jay Santiago
&nbsp;
No fava beans, no chianti, but "Red Dragon" still packs all the flavor of the Hannibal Lecter movies. 

The third installment of the trilogy is directed by Brett Ratner, of "Rush Hour" fame. It is based on the novel written by Thomas Harris, and is basically a remake of Michael Mann's "Manhunter." The film serves as a prequel to the Oscar-winning "Silence of the Lambs." 

Unlike "Hannibal," "Red Dragon" returns to the basics of "Silence of the Lambs," teasing you mentally, scaring you without actually showing a thing. Anthony Hopkins reprises the role of Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter, a genius doctor turned cannibal, easily one of the most notorious and spine-chilling villains of our time. 

Edward Norton plays Will Graham, an ex-FBI agent who captured Lecter quite coincidentally, after going to him for advice on a case. The events of the arrest cause Graham to retire from the FBI and move his family to Florida, where he avoids his past life and society by fixing boat engines. 

After several years pass, a new serial-killer known as "The Tooth Fairy," (Ralph Fiennes) begins to wreak havoc, killing families and leaving bite marks in their bodies, (the trademark from which he gets his name.)

This leads the FBI to turn to Graham for help. After studying two horrific crime scenes, Graham realizes that he must seek the advice of a disturbingly brilliant mind. 

For that, he turns to Lecter once more. The two work wonderfully together on screen, displaying great chemistry. 

A chess game begins, as they race to put a face to this monster before he can kill again. Unfortunately, Lecter does not have the effect he did when the role was created 14 years ago. His wit is still sharp and a joy to watch, but he is no longer scary. After watching him for so long he's almost normal, a staple if you will.

One of the things that makes "Silence of the Lambs" great is that Lecter can terrify you by simply breathing. The belief of his capability to kill is what frightens you. 

"Red Dragon" does deliver great thrills. However, the plot is startlingly similar to the original film, with the emphasis being placed on the story instead of overexposing the characters, unlike "Hannibal" where Lecter was bland and overused. The movie does a beautiful job in the first five minutes, thrusting you into the story and explaining how Lecter was ultimately arrested and sent to the boxed-glass cell that we are all familiar with.  

From then on, the pace is methodical, creating a certain unease that is only ruined by horrible music that belongs in a cheap teen horror flick, the kind where a bunch of naked blondes run around while the jocks get killed.

Clearly the movie is forced, a designed moneymaker that becomes predictable at times. However, the established acting and smooth plot does not allow this to cross your mind much.

 Instead, you appreciate "Red Dragon" for what it is, a high-quality, sincerely suspenseful story.

Headline: In response to aspersions against my good name...
Subheadline:  
Author: Brian.Abramson@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
To the editor,
I write in response to aspersions against my good name written in this week's Beacon by Jorge Montes.  He suggests that I claim "that the SGC president and vice-president are entitled to housing because the President of the United States is," and refers to that claim as "downright laughable," ascribing it to my supposedly gargantuan ego.  It is an old newspaperman's trick to remove a few of the more sensible lines from a letter to the editor with which the paper disagrees, and then rebut the letter for not making sense.  Not that I'm suggesting that such a thing has occurred in this case... but the letter which I originally wrote to the Beacon was apparently trimmed for space in a way that lends credence to criticism.  I had, in fact, noted therein that not only the President, but also "all state governors, many lieutenant governors, and even a good number of mayors" receive housing along with the job--in short, that housing is indeed a 'perk' that comes with the peculiar burdens of holding an elected executive office.  Having worked with a number of mayors, I have come to realize that the president of the student government at a university the size of our own is functionally similar in workload and assigned civic responsibilities to a mayor for a town of equivalent size.  Consequently, I feel that those who hold the executive positions in student government should be treated not as presidents with mansions or helicopters, but as mayors of the small town that we share.  In that analysis, a free dorm room--at no expense to the student body--is simply not a disproportionate benefit.  I would add that I have no personal relationship with any current executive officeholder in student government, nor do I anticipate seeking such office again.  I therefore have no personal stake in the outcome of this debate, except to assert what I believe would benefit the student body, based on over ten years of experience at various levels within this University--as an undergraduate, graduate, and law student, a teaching assistant, an advisor in the School of Journalism, a participant in all possible manner of civic activities... and even as a writer for the Beacon.
Peace and love,
Brian Dean Abramson

FIU's Mei Ly (Miami/Coral Gables) and Christine Suard picked up opening-round victories at the Gator Fall Classic at Linder Stadium at Ring Tennis Complex in Gainesville, but were ousted in second-round play. 

The classic featured performers from 10 colleges and universities from around Florida, Georgia and Alabama.

In their first action in a week, the Florida International Women's Soccer team couldn't overcome a 16-3 corner kick disadvantage and fell 3-0 to South Alabama Friday night in Mobile, Ala.

South Alabama 3, FIU 0

The Jags (4-5-3, 1-0-1) scoring came from a variety of sources. Rebecca Kahn scored the opening goal at 23:10 as she drove in a rebound from teammate Heather Adamus.  

Following an FIU own-goal, Kathy Steinmetz scored her third goal of the season with assists from Julia Herman and Melissa Moeschl.

For the Golden Panthers (1-9-1, 1-1), the game was their first since a traffic accident took the lives of Sasja Odenyo and former trainer. Erika Jaberblom, another former player, was hospitalized but survived. 
In the wake of the tragedy, the Golden Panthers played flatly, uncharacteristically giving up more goals than they stopped. 

Hurricane Lili leads to game cancellation

For the second time in six days, the FIU Women's Soccer team has had a game cancelled, this time due to the remnants of Hurricane Lili.  

Lousiana-Lafayette cancelled the contest late Saturday night due to flooding caused by the storm. No make-up time has been scheduled.

Author: Daisy FernÃ¡ndez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team continues to turn its season around. By defeating West Virginia on Sept. 29, they evened their record to 4-4-0. On this last day of FIU's 2002 Umbro Classic, the team ousted the Mountaineers, 2-1. 

FIU 2, West Virginia 1

With no goals in the first half, both teams were prepared to play harder in the second half. The Golden Panthers took the lead in the 47th minute, when midfielder Matias Asorey scored his fourth goal of the season. Allen Handy assisted with a high cross pass that midfielder Adam Wilson headed to Asorey. Asorey then made a successful shot past WVU's keeper Christ McKinney. 

A foul was called on WVU two minutes later, which allowed FIU's defender Juan Rivera to score  from 23 yards out. 

At the 76:38 mark, Rusty Girton gave the Mountaineers their first and only goal of the match.  FIU's goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg deflected a shot by Sean Sexstone but pushed it to Girton, who in- turn made his first goal of the year. Rosenberg had five saves against the 
Mountaineers. 

FIU took 14 shots in the contest, while WVU had 11. 

With this defeat by FIU, WVU has fallen to 3-6-0.

Overall, the Golden Panthers made four goals throughout the weekend tournament. FAU took won first place after knocking off Columbia, 4-3. 

Rosenberg honored

Roy Rosenberg has received more recognition for his outstanding work on the field. This goalkeeper was named Goalkeeper of the Week once again by the Atlantic Soccer Conference on September 30. He made 11 saves in FIU's Umbro Classic alone, which earned him the Most Valuable Defensive Player award in the tournament.

Headline: Football enjoys week off, prepares for Western Kentucky
Author: Dan Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The football team took advantage of their week of rest to examine their goals and accomplishments thus far in the season.

"Everyone gets a C," Head coach Don Strock said. "One day your defense gives up 377 yards rushing and then 50 yards another day."

"It's just as if you were in school, you get an A here, but a D or an F and now you got a C."

It is no secret that the penalty situation is making Golden Panther fans, players, and coaches cringe at their every mention. FIU has accumulated 46 penalties for 392 yards already in its inaugural season.  

"The roughing penalties such as last Saturday, that's a referee's judgement call," Strock reiterated. 

Strock turned his attention to FIU's next opponent, No. 4 Western Kentucky.

"They are an excellent football team. They've beaten Youngstown State who has won four or five titles. We need to play teams like this to see where we are as a program. Next year we're playing the Georgia Southern's and the Troy State's," said Strock.

Talent Pool

A huge reason for FIU's success up until now is due to the fact that they have been able to lure great athletes to its novice program.

The Golden Panthers, without playing a game, had already stolen a quarterback  and free safety from Florida, and have received transfers form UConn, Ole Miss, and West Virginia. All of which are quality division I programs. 

Key Performers

Freshman quarterback Jamie Burke has not disappointed after being named the starter late this summer. He has completed 53 of 87 passes (61%) for 840 yards with 8 touchdowns against 3 interceptions.
