Headline: Women's soccer loses in championship
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Mean Green of North Texas ended FIU's hopes of a title and an NCAA tournament bid in the final 7.6 seconds of the championship match at the 2004 Aeropostale Sun-Belt Conference Women's Soccer Tournament on Saturday night.

        

With both sides even at nil and regulation time running out, a questionable foul on the left wing allowed for a North Texas free kick from midfield. An opportunistic Andrea Marak quickly restarted play for the Mean Green, sending a flying prayer into the center of the box, which found its way amid a crowd of defenders and onto the head of Alyssa Carrier. The junior forward headed in the winning goal and only score of the match. She was later named the tournaments most outstanding player and received all-tournament honors with two goals in three matches.



The win was North Texas' 16th of the season, the most in school history and the first SBC championship for a side that's made the finals every year since 2001. By winning the tournament, NT earns the right to represent the SBC in the NCAA Division I Soccer Championship starting Nov. 12th. 



The final was an arduous and physical match with 37 fouls split between the two sides and numerous no-calls on some hard challenges. This made the final foul called, with under eight seconds left in the regulation 90 minutes, somewhat uncharacteristic of the rest of the match.



Junior midfielder, Janessa Taddai, proved herself to be in impressive form throughout the tournament, scoring a goal and assisting on two others in the three games. She, along with sophomore midfielder Val Patrick (2 goals, 1 assist) and freshman forward Janet Ligouri (1 goal) earned themselves spots on the SBC all-tournament team.



FIU finished the season with a 7-12-1 overall record including an impressive 6-0-1 mark when playing at University Park.  



Earlier in the week, the Golden Panthers defeated the number five seed Western Kentucky Hilltoppers and the top-seeded Blue Raiders of Middle Tennessee in quarterfinal and semifinal play.

&nbsp;
"Just another day at the office." That would be one way to describe the FIU Women's Cross Country team's performance at last weekend's Sun Belt Conference Championships in Little Rock, Ark.

Sophomore Amanda Howard who finished in third place at the meet running a 5k in 18.53, led the team. 

The lady Golden Panthers finished third in the conference for the second year in a row and once again advanced to the NCAA South Regional meet on Nov. 13 in Tuscalousa, Ala.

By finishing in the top ten at the conference meet, Howard earned all-Sun Belt honors for the first time in her career. 

She is also the only Golden Panther to have ever finished in the top five at the conferences' crowning meet. 

Paola Reategui finished 15th for the Panthers with a time of 19.48; Deidra Witherspoon and Apryl Wall finished just five seconds apart each other in 25th and 27th places respectively. 

Katherine Cardenas closed out the points for FIU with a 53rd place finish at 22.21. 

Western Kentucky walked away with the title combining for just 33 points; they were followed by Arkansas-Little Rock with 69. 

The Golden Panthers edged New Mexico State University by just one point, 123-124. 

Last year's runner-up, North Texas, finished six points behind FIU with a team score of 129. 

The men's, team on the other hand, once again struggled to find their place and finished dead last in tenth place, consequently ending their sub-par season. 

DJ Keller once again led the Golden Panthers, finishing the 8K race in 43rd place with a time of 28.48; Egon Vollmer finished second for the team eight places behind Keller with a time of 29.22.

Angel Fernandez, Noel Delgadillo, Robert Castillo, and Rene Rodriguez all finished within five spots of each other. 

FIU finished with a team score of 272. 

The Golden Panther men's team were tamed by the Ragin' Cajuns from the University of Louisiana-Lafayette who won the meet with a team total of 58 points, five in front of runner-up Middle Tennessee State.

Headline: Plentz assumes leading role for men's soccer
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The leading goal scorer for the Golden Panthers men's soccer team has come a long way in more aspects than one.

 Fernando Plentz, the senior forward and native of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil arrived in Miami during the summer of 2002. The trip and adjustments were difficult to overcome, but, as Fernando admits, "Change is always good." 

This is not the first time that Fernando lived in the United States. In 1994 at age 12, Plentz and his family lived in Dallas, Texas, before returning back to Brazil. Traveling was part of Fernando's ordinary life, as his father Jaime was an engineer for the Texaco Oil Company, requiring the family to move and relocate on a continuous basis for his job. 

Fernando's road to stardom as a Golden Panther was in itself a lengthy one. Although Plentz grew up in the soccer capital of the world, he first became intrigued with the prospect of playing college soccer when he was in Texas. While in Dallas, Fernando attended a college soccer game and soon realized that playing soccer for a university was what he wanted to accomplish in life. 

But, his goals were derailed, when his father's job forced the family to move back to Brazil. Plentz does not have any regrets about his continuous traveling experiences, as he understands that his family had little choice.

He finally got his long-awaited opportunity in the summer of 2002, when his father arranged a tryout with head coach Karl Kremser. A mutual friend of Plentz's father and coach Kremser made the arrangement possible. Upon meeting Plentz, "coach Kremser did not know what to expect," Fernando explained. 

The tryout was based on an exhibition game in which Fernando participated, playing against the Soccer Locker team. 

"I played terrible. I played so bad that coach Kremser thought I wasted his time," Plentz said. 

This experience did not discourage Plentz however, as he returned to Brazil for the remainder of the summer, where he watched the World Cup as inspiration and followed it with continuous training in an effort for another chance at a tryout. 

Plentz got another tryout and second opportunity to impress the FIU coach. Except this time he shined. 

In a 3-2 preseason scrimmage win, Plentz scored all of the team's three goals and won over the coach. 

"I was in a much better shape and much more prepared, and things just turned out well for me," Plentz said. 

Everything seemed to be going well for Plentz; he was enrolled in the school and he was playing the sport he loved, but his journey was far from complete. 	

Fernando's playing time during his first year with FIU was limited. He played in only 10 games, recording four shots and no points, before injuring his shoulder and missing the remainder of the season. The injury was difficult to overcome, as he was still in the process of adjusting and learning FIU's system, but Plentz's toughest obstacle was yet to come. 

The following year, despite coming off the bench, Fernando's minutes increased significantly and he was on the verge of having a breakout year, when he fractured his leg during an awkward tackle attempt. At the time, Fernando had played in 14 games and led the team with five goals and thirteen total points. He missed the remainder of the season. 

"It was very disappointing and frustrating, I worked and prepared so hard and then that happened. It was very devastating to deal with at first," Fernando said. 

His teammates and coaches, however, eased the recovery process, when they showed their support; helping him in various situations, and wearing undershirts during games, which included inspirational messages for a speedy recovery.

 Fernando did not let himself feel down; he continued to travel with the team, even attending a game in UCLA, all in support of his teammates. The team later bounced out in the Sweet 16 that year and Plentz's road to recovery was underway. 

A fracture and two surgeries later, the forward still feels the effects of last year's injury after each practice and every game.

 Plentz admits that he is still not at 100 percent; he is going through rehab and feels soreness in his ankle daily. With that in mind, one can only imagine the success he would have playing on two healthy legs, as he already leads the team with six goals and 12 total points through 13 games this season. 

Plentz's next home game will be on Nov.12 against Hartwick. The forward hopes the season ends in victory in order to head into the NCAA tournament with high spirits.

&nbsp;
The Host Golden Panthers Women's Soccer team advanced to the final round of the 2004 Aeropostale Sun Belt Conference Tournament on Nov. 6, after consecutive victories over fifth seeded Western Kentucky and number one seed Middle Tennessee in the quarterfinal and semifinal matches. 

The fourth seeded Golden Panthers improved to a perfect 7-0 at home (8-11-1 overall) and move on to face the No. 2 seed North Texas (15-5-1) in the final round. 

The match will take place at University Park on Nov. 6 at 1 p.m. The winner will be crowned Sun Belt Conference Champion and receive an automatic bid into the NCAA Championship tournament.

Semifinal: FIU 2 - MT 2

The Golden Panthers defeated top-seed Middle Tennessee on Nov. 4 on penalty kicks (3-2) after a 2-2 draw in regulation and two scoreless overtime periods.With the shootout tied at 2-2, Junior Janessa Taddei slammed a penalty kick past the outstretched arms of Middle Tennessee's Jenny Manis striking the upper left hand corner of the goal and giving the host team a one-goal advantage.

Scottish-born Claire Ward of the Blue Raiders had a chance to equalize and send the shootout into a sudden-death sixth round, but her shot was just inches too high and ricocheted off the crossbar, effectively ending the match. 

It was the first penalty kick shootout in Middle Tennessee's nine-year history.

Forwards Whitney Rezendes and Janet Ligouri scored a goal a piece for FIU. Ligouri's goal opened the scoring just 2:52 seconds into the first half with a brilliantly executed shot into the lower right-hand corner to put the Panthers ahead, 1-0.

The Raiders answered back with goals by Rebecca Rodriguez in the 57th minute and English-born Debs Brereton in the 72nd. Brereton struck a gorgeous goal from 25 yards out to give the lady Raiders a 2-1 advantage.

It was Rezendes, however, that had the goal of the match. With FIU down a goal and time quickly running out, the freshman striker received a long pass from Val Patrick in the 82nd minute. 

Rezendes was making a strong run toward goal and beat three Raider defenders, dribbling her way toward the left side of the box. Then she lobbed a left-footed shot from an angle, 8 yards out, over the head of Manis and into the far post to send the match into extra time.

Chanelle Crosby and Whitney Rezendes scored in the first two rounds of the shootout for FIU. MT's Brereton sent a ball sailing over the crossbar and Madeline Gannon made a diving save to lift the Golden Panthers to a 2-0 start in penalty kicks. 

Laura Miguez and Rachel Holmes evened the score in the third and fourth round respectively, but Ward's misfire was the difference and the Golden Panthers advanced to the final.

"It was a hard-fought match," said skipper Everton Edwards. "We have a lot of admiration for Middle Tennessee and they played a great game. Neither team deserved to lose this one."

Quarterfinal: FIU 5 - WKU 3
Nov. 3  

FIU opened the 2004 Aeropostale Sun Belt Conference Championships in impressive fashion, scoring five goals against the Hilltoppers of Western Kentucky in the quarterfinal round.

Western Kentucky University jumped ahead early when Alicia Dalby scored from outside the box in the 11th minute of the match. The FIU equalizer came in the 40th minute, off the foot of Megan Meade, who found the ball in front of the goal after a Janessa Taddei corner kick.The second half was the most productive in FIU history, as the Golden Panthers scored four goals in 45 minutes. 

Janessa Taddei scored her eighth goal of the season 10 minutes into the second half on a bending free kick from ten yards outside the box and assisted in Yaneash Donaldson's goal in the 53rd minute. 

Valerie Patrick scored twice for the first time in her FIU career, tallying goals in the 71st and 77th minutes to help boost FIU past Western Kentucky and into the semifinal round.

Head coach Everton Edwards was banned from the match because of a booking received for arguing with an official during the season finale against North Texas. Assistant coach Daniel Brizard sat in for Edwards.

At press time, the final game of the Sun Belt Conference had yet to take place.

Headline: Modern day opinions lack foundation
Author: Luis Nin / Illustrator
&nbsp;
Nowadays, everyone hides behind their opinions. 

In our new politically correct America, opinions have changed from deeply held beliefs to excuses for ignorance. 

We completely refuse to argue our opinions. Americans simply don't care about the truth anymore; they only care about preserving their ignorance and prejudices. 

Our discourse has died, and our search for truth has become paralyzed. 

Debate has become nothing more than a game, a series of arguments that rival each other in style rather than content. This new age of debate works on the premise that everyone's belief is equally correct. 

However, this principle has a fundamental problem: the truth is not egalitarian. In most cases, we're either right or we're wrong. It's nearly impossible to have it both ways. 

In this new age of reason, Jesus exists right alongside  Buddha and Mohammed. Heaven is just four miles east of Nirvana. 

Telling anyone who believes in fairies, psychics and aliens that their beliefs are wrong is intolerant and small-minded. 

In our attempt to respect the beliefs of others, we've left behind our own objectivity. 

For example, there are many who believe that Adolf Hitler wasn't such a bad guy, just a little misunderstood. 

They'll emphasize his leadership abilities, his artistic triumphs or his love for his countrymen. 

Nevertheless, if we took these peoples' opinions seriously, we'd be running around in white hoods, lynching anything that cast a shadow.

No one cares about the truth anymore. We have embraced moral relativism, and our opinions and beliefs are growing shallow. 

People don't want to argue anymore; they just want to get along and go on with their lives. That's all well and good, but the problem with this system is that our beliefs are becoming empty. 

If no one can be wrong, no one can be right, either. Nihilism is creeping in.

Most people wouldn't question you if you got up one day and began to hold the opinion that God was a seven-headed camel that straddles the earth. 

Many would just shrug their shoulders and say, "whatever." 

These days, the most insane ideas are accepted as valid opinions. Just look at New Ageism and Scientology.

Religion and philosophy have become cultural traits that define us. It's becoming hip and trendy to be religious. 

It's also a great way for white people to look culturally diverse. 

Just take a look at Madonna and her recent plunge into the Kabbalah.

Opinions and beliefs do not exist to reflect our individuality; they exist to help us grasp the truth. 

If our beliefs are worth anything, someone must challenge them, and if we truly want to respect the beliefs of others, we, in turn, must challenge their beliefs. That is the only way that we will get anywhere. 

But, then again, that's only my opinion.

Headline: Students divided over presidential election results
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
On Nov. 2, freshman Jessica Thavarajah sat in her Panther Hall room at University Park with friends, staring at a flashing red and blue map on the TV screen. Upon noticing that the map had become predominately red-the colors used by news stations to pinpoint Republican voting states-Thavarajah cheered, ran out her door and elicited mixed reactions as she happily yelled through the corridors, "Bush is winning! Bush is winning!"

Many Bush supporters at FIU shared Thavarajah's  excitment as the president and many Republican senators were elected after one of the most highly contested elections in decades.

"It was cool to follow, to see what the candidates had to say," said freshman Nickolai Koverda, a Russian-born resident who followed the elections even though he couldn't vote. "I personally would have voted for John Kerry if I had the chance, but at least everything's over and we could go back to normal."

Normal, however, is a notion some think the country can't achieve at this moment.

Democrats rallied behind Massachusetts Senator John Forbes Kerry during the election - pointing out the ongoing war in Iraq, increased tension between the U.S. and foreign powers and what many consider to be a sloping economy - in an effort to remove Bush from office and put an about face on current policies.

"I'm a little disappointed that Kerry lost. There are many issues the Bush administration holds that I disagree with, and I think Kerry could have changed a lot of things," said freshman Kevin Wilson.

Many students took advantage of Florida's early voting system to voice their opinions by casting their votes - sometimes standing in hour-long lines - or sending in absentee ballots.

As the night arrived and the polls closed, many followed the ballot counting by TV, radio or computers. This time around, though, Florida was not as big an electoral hinge as it was during the 2000 elections, as it was declared shortly after midnight that Bush won the state. Instead, the focus was on Ohio, where Republicans were not informed of the state's electoral votes until the next morning.

"I stayed glued to my TV for as long as I could," said sophomore Mike Calero. "I'm happy Bush won. He's done great things with homeland security, and I think the nation chose the best person to be its leader."

However, Calero says he understands all the complaints that have been brought against the presidency, especially by students who attend traditionally liberal college campuses.

"Everyone has a right to their opinion, as long as they have the facts to back them up," said Calero.

Still, despite the large Republican win, many Bush supporters felt the tension between parties on campus.

Christina Crum, a freshman, says that, as a Republican, she often feels like a minority on her own campus.

"I know more college students tend to be liberal, so I would hear a lot of their ideas. Even in the classroom, teachers would slip political opinions into their lecture, and that made me feel uncomfortable," she said.

With elections over,  Crum hopes the bipartisan tension will ebb over the next few months.

"We should all stick with our leader, even if we disagree with some of his decisions. This is a time when we should all come together as a nation," Crum said.

Headline: Haiti celebrated despite tragedies
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
Two hundred years after Haitian General Toussaint L'Ouverture led a slave rebellion that freed Haiti from the rule of Napoleonic France, the tiny Caribbean nation is again experiencing major struggles. 

In the beginning of the year, an uprising ousted President Jean-Bertrand Arisitide and, later on, over 3,000 citizens died in floods brought by this summer's constant wave of hurricanes.

Because this year is  the  bicentennial anniversary of that fateful uprising, various organizations at FIU have made an effort to both celebrate the nation's independence and aid its citizens.

"It's horrible to constantly hear all the bad things that go on there," said Mikael Moran, a freshman and mechanical engineering major whose parents are from Haiti. 

Though his family's house is in southern Haiti, he says he knows people in the northern part of the island, where most of the flooding took place.

"I keep track of all the events that have been happening there, and it's really heartbreaking," Moran said.

As a member of the Haitian Student Organization, Moran has participated in fund-raising events to make people more aware of issues currently taking place in his country.

"The more informed people are, the more they'll appreciate the situation and what [the Haitian population] is going through," he said.

So far, the organization has sponsored a party in October that raised $700 and collected over 600 canned goods, all of which were sent to Haitian charities.

On Nov. 18, the organization will hold a celebration in honor of Haiti's bicentennial. The party will include "kompa" - a type of Haitian music - traditional foods and dances. 

The event aims to bring the large Haitian community at FIU together.

Fedorah Sylvain, president of the HSO, believes that now, more than ever, is the right time for students to get involved with the affairs of their country.

"There is so much going on right now that people never hear about. We want to bring FIU Haitians together, because that is the only way we can confront these problems, even if we are so far away from our country," Sylvain  said.

To educate the wider community on Haitian culture, the Phillip and Patricia Frost Art Museum at University Park set up special programs. Since the start of the term, the museum has been running an exhibit entitled "Lespri Endependans," a showcase of various sculptures and metal works created by  Haitian artists.

"This is an exhibit that's important for everyone," said Gonzalo Adrian Battaglia, the museum's curator of education. "There is a very broad Haitian population here in Miami, but because they're not in the spotlight as much as Cubans or other communities, their traditions don't carry the recognition they deserve."

The museum also holds special events every Wednesday, welcoming students to lectures and films documenting the plight of the Haitian people and their long history.

"All students should take advantage of these events, since they  broaden the college experience by showing what kind of diversity we have, not only in the school, but in the city as well," Battaglia said.

Yet some do not completely agree with the  exhibit's content. 

Moran, who takes classes at UP, says  he diagrees with the way his culture is portrayed through the exhibit.

"Most of what they have in there is just voodoo stuff. There's more to Haitian art than just that - things that are really beautiful and have hope in them. We need to let people know that Haiti isn't all dark and scary, that there's good stuff in there, too," he said.

On the other hand, Sylvain feels that, though the exhibit itself may be a bit too grim, the message of the Haitian culture does manage to get across.

"Every time I pass by the museum, I feel happy just to see displays from my country. The bicentennial is about celebrating our freedom and culture, and anything we can show to the public about those things is good," she said.

The New World African Studies department sponsored discussions at both campuses that focused on different aspects of the Haitian culture. 

At UP, the Eric E. Williams Lecture held in September featured a speech by Robert Fatton on the fall of President Aristide and a discussion by  author Edwidge Danticat.

The Biscayne Bay campus also held a lecture on Nov. 6 in which Columbia University professor Winston James discussed the legacy of General L'Ouverture in modern black political thought.

Despite all the bicentennial celebration, some still believe that the festivities have been eclipsed by Haiti's many tragedies.

"The year is almost ending, and it makes me sad to think that Haiti had to go through so much during a time when it should be celebrating," Sylvain said. "As long as the ones who have left [Haiti] can remember those who were left behind and all the problems [they still face], there is still hope for us; there will always be hope for us."

A 33-year-old Florida International University student was found on Nov. 9 with a wound across his chest.  According to campus police, the student was found in the shower by his roommate who was in the room when the event occurred. "The wounds appear to be self-inflicted," said Sgt. Alberto Alfonso of the FIU Police Department's investigations unit. 

The knife was recovered in the shower with the student, and police say that no foul play is suspected. Although the case is under investigation, Sgt. Alfonso says the student's friends stated that he had been depressed lately. According to police, the student's depression could be attributed to his grandmother's death in September and his recent break-up with his long-time girlfriend.

The roommate is not a suspect in the case, said Sgt. Alfonso.

Police say the knife entered the heart cavity, but missed the heart. The student is currently in stable condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center but is expected to recover.

The incident occurred in Building J of the University Park Apartments located on the University Park Campus.

Headline: Profile on Channel 7 News' Craig Stevens
Author: Cesar Gutierrez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Although some people may think that anchoring news is just reading a script, they may get surprised to know that it may be quite different.

At least that has been the case of Craig Stevens whose beginning in the media was as a reporter. Not in Miami, but in the small market of Fort Meyers.

Through the years he has covered stories as important as the Oklahoma city bombing and Cuba's massive migration in the summer of 1994. For that particular coverage, Stevens stayed in Cuba for a whole week working undercover. He interviewed citizens even though the Cuban government didn't allow it. He and his crew risked their lives and their freedom.

As he and his cameraman boarded the plain to come back to Miami, immigration officers in the island told them to not ever go back to Cuba. The officers knew what they had been doing over there.

Stevens was born and raised in Massachusetts. But once he decided to pursue a career as a journalist he moved to Washington D.C, and studied at American University. However, for him Washington itself became a big school since there was so much going on with politics and politicians.

When he is asked what made him to become a journalist, his answer is straight forward: "I like to write. If there is something I don't know about, I like researching to get the information. So, all those things together encouraged me to study Journalism." 

Besides, having worked for his high school newspaper, and later for the university's newspaper, helped him decide his future.

He started on television as a reporter in small towns. Stevens is the first to admit that in order to be a good anchor: "one has to be a good reporter first."

As far as Miami, when comparing what cities are better to work for as a journalist, it is the number one for him. "Miami is one of the cities that I think many people who work here when they leave they miss it. It is because local news here are made from international news," he said. He has covered news from Cuba, Haiti and the Caribbean, just to name a few which, according to him, are considered local news here in Miami.

He says that this is not the case with the majority of local news channels in the country. "The nature of South Florida is fast. You never know what gonna happen next," he stated.

Stevens doesn't consider his job to be a dangerous one. At least not in Miami, as opposed to, let's say Colombia. However, he thinks that it can be difficult especially when people don't want to cooperate in the news making.

The anchor also thinks that journalists can be biased, or not as objective as they should be when reporting or writing the news. That's the reason he finds working with other persons a magnificent tool against subjectiveness since they can check each other's work.

As far as the advice he can give to new comers of TV news business, he doesn't hesitate to emphasize the importance of improving one's writing skills. He goes as far as saying: "If I have to work with an intern who doesn't like to write, I don't waste my time with him. If you don't like writing, go do something else." 

Stevens also says that in anchoring news one has to be copy editor as well. Therefore good writing skills, again, are a must. He also added that hosting news come last. First is reporting. So new comers, be patient!

This is Craig Stevens, a person who loves his job. He doesn't see himself doing anything else. A journalist a heart. A "reader" that goes beyond what's given to him. He is a professional who writes, reports and hosts. May be that's why his rationale is an accurate one: "Reporters need to know a little bit about a lot of things."

When the officer confronted the man, he confessed to the crime. The officer took him to the FIU Police Department for processing and then to the Dade County Jail for booking.

Subheadline: Philosophy Through "The Elephant Man"
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Christopher Grau, an assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy, will be examining the philosophical themes of David Lynch's "The Elephant Man" on Nov. 13.

The Classic/Foreign Film Discussion Group, Inc., a Florida non-profit group, is screening the film at the Biscayne Bay Campus in Academic I, Room 130, from 12 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.

The film is based on the true story of Englishman John Merrick, a grotesquely deformed circus attraction who is discovered by a surgeon and made the most famous man in London. 

The lecture that follows will discuss such questions as:  What is the distinction between persons and non-persons, such as animals or objects? What  constitutes personhood?

Grau states that he chose "The Elephant Man" for the philosophy behind it.

"[The film] is a strong depiction of Kantian moral ethics," he said. 

This philosophy, named after German Immanuel Kant, states that it is wrong to exploit others and that a good deed is only worthy if it is done with good intentions. 

Grau received his B.A. from New York University and his M.A. and Ph.D. from John Hopkins University.

He is most famous for editing the "Philosophy & The Matrix" section on the official website for "The Matrix" movies. 

He is currently teaching Philosophy of Film at University Park and next semester will teach Philosophy Through Film at BBC. 

The non-profit group expects a $3 donation from faculty and students and a $4 donation from non-FIU students.

A reservation is required, so if you are interested, reserve a seat by calling 954-458-5825.

Headline: No vaccine for you? Here's how to dodge the flu
Author: Patricia Anstett / Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
Can't get a flu shot? Then educate and protect yourself. Chances are, you'll avoid picking up someone else's flu germs and stay healthy.

With the flu season under way, we called on experts for ways to help you stay healthy this flu season. Here's what you need to know: 

HOW FLU BUGS SPREAD 

Flu viruses come in various types, or strains, and some years they're stronger than others. They keep changing, too. Just when the experts think they know how to stop them, they change, or mutate, again. 

Dr. Howard Markel, a University of Michigan professor and author of the new book "How Germs Travel," says it's like preparing to play a U-M football team wearing maize-and-blue uniforms in the first half of a game, only to come back after half time and see a team in green and white. Predicting which strain of flu will emerge each year is a guessing game made by educated guessers. They do their best. But sometimes, they're wrong, and the vaccine doesn't match the strain.

Flu germs spread when a person with the flu coughs into the air, sneezes or touches something with germy hands. The germs don't live long on toilet seats, money or mail. But in a closed room or on an airplane, particularly if the trip lasts more than 3 hours, you should avoid anyone coughing or sneezing into the air.

If you are a traveler and really worried, pay attention to the Web site www.cdc.gov, to see which areas of the country are hardest hit by flu and consider delaying trips there if you can. 

If you're really worried, take a page from last year's lessons on SARS prevention and consider wearing an N-95 mask, the federally designated mouth and nose defense system. Don't even think about traveling if you have the flu. If you want to really be careful, open doors or hold straps on buses with a paper towel. If people offer to shake your hand, politely say: "Sorry, I'm not shaking hands right now. Hope you understand."

Some people may not understand or think you are taking this flu stuff a bit too seriously, but it's your health you are protecting. 

FIRST, DO NO HARM 

If you are sick, please, stay home from work or school and refrain from doing errands until you have stopped coughing and you no longer have a fever.

Don't know if what you have is a cold or the flu? Flu takes a big whack out of you and typically is accompanied by a headache and a fever above 101 degrees. You won't be able to climb out of bed. You probably will be unable to work from home for several days. Keep your distance from everyone else until your coughing stops. Cough into your sleeve or a tissue, not into your hands, and throw away the tissue immediately.

FLU KNOW-HOW 

Wash your hands vigorously and often with plain old soap and warm water or, if you prefer, an alcohol-based hand sanitizing product. Wash as long as it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" twice. Experts say microbial hand washes are a waste of money.

Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose, where flu bugs like to gather. Eat properly. Get a good night's sleep. Exercise. Stay strong. If you get the flu, go to your doctor immediately to get an anti viral medicine, which should be taken during the first 2 days you experience flu symptoms. 

These drugs, known under such brand and generic names as Flumadine, rimantadine, Relenza and Tamiflu, come in pill, syrup and orally inhaled forms. Although they usually lessen the duration and severity of the flu, they can cause harsh side effects, including nervousness, anxiety, nausea, nasal infections, headaches and dizziness. They range in price from $35 to $86 for a typical course and may not be covered by insurance. 

HERBAL OPTIONS 

There's debate about whether vitamins and herbal products help prevent the flu. The Internet offers a mother lode of products, including garlic capsules and bath solutions like tea tree oil, to stimulate the immune system. Zinc tablets may work, some doctors say. 

Experts disagree vehemently about vitamin C, however. Just remember this: Too much vitamin C is not good for you. It's an acid that can irritate your stomach. 

A better bet is to pack your diet with foods rich in vitamin C. Ann Arbor registered dietitian Diana Dyer suggests oranges, grapefruit, kiwi, berries, carrots, sweet potatoes, sweet pepper, tomatoes, spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage and brussel sprouts. 

She also recommends foods high in vitamin E, including avocados, nuts, seeds and wheat germ, as well as tuna, herring, mackerel and other fatty fishes, to help make white blood cells that fight infection. 

Deep breathing and massage may boost the immune system. Sit or lie with your spine straight and take 10 deep breaths each hour.

Headline: Russel Wright exhibit
Author: Julia Marchese / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
The Russel Wright Exhibit,  located on the second floor of the Green Library,  honors the centennial of the birth of the American designer Russel Wright. 

While Wright's creations are very modern looking, they are less Art Deco and more amorphous in their  modern style.

Wright's early works consist of a limited number of masks of celebrities. Early in his career, he also created several groups of animal images, such as Libbilou horse bookends, a Whoozoo seal paperweight in gold finish and a swan nut cup, all made from various metals. They all came in different sizes and were considerably heavy. The pieces are inscribed with his initials, R.W., and remain his most sought after work.

The exhibit will run from Aug. 20 through Dec. 17. Admission is free and open to the public. For more information call 305-348-0297.

Subheadline: Galacian eatery offers authenticity of culture
Author: Carlos C. Olaechea / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As a Latin American, I often wonder where we got the ideas to make many of the dishes we eat. Of course, I know that the vast majority of our culinary inspiration comes from Spain or Portugal, but I am always curious to know how Latin American renditions of Spanish dishes compare to the originals that inspired them. 

Fortunately, I was able to satisfy this curiosity at El Gallegazo, one of the few authentic Spanish restaurants in Miami. 

 El Gallegazo is literally translated as "The Big Galician." Franco, the restaurant's owner, is almost always there, and is probably the biggest Galician in Miami. He is steadfast in his pride and love for that region of Spain. Galicia is a region in northern Spain close to the Portuguese border, and it shares a great deal of cultural and culinary similarities with Portugal, like linguistic similarities and a very interesting green wine called Albarinho (sometimes spelled Albariño). 

Once you're inside the restaurant, the decor constantly reminds you that you are about the eat Spanish food: There are  Galician souvenirs, maps, posters and soccer team banners on every wall, giving the restaurant a kitschy vibe, but also the sense that the owner really wants you to love Galicia as much as he does. 

And you'll love Galicia and its Miami outpost, El Gallegazo, after the attentive and courteous staff pampers you. They always make sure to serve the ladies first, a tradition that so few servers practice these days in Miami. 

We chose an appetizer, the quintessential entremes ($10.95),  a cold assortment of imported Serrano ham, sliced chorizo, Manchego cheese and olives. The cold cuts and cheese were well aged, and the portions  were enough to wet the appetite without ruining it. Entrées were huge and could easily satisfy two people. 

My two dining partners ordered the Jarrete de Cordero al vino ($8.95), which is a lamb shank braised in red wine and seasonings. This came with the choice of boiled potatoes, rice or papas españolas (homemade potato chips). 

The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and was well seasoned with a delicious sauce that invited you to lick the plate clean. 

I ordered Pulpo a la Gallega ($13.95), a gargantuan serving of tender octopus with a simple seasoning of olive oil, garlic and paprika on a bed of diced boiled potatoes. The portion was so big that I could only eat a quarter of it, but it was well worth it. 

El Gallegazo also makes very good desserts, such as crema catlana (Spain's thinner answer to the crème brûlée), and  peras al vino, whole pears simmered in wine and sugar served with their sumptuous cooking liquid.

We returned again on Sunday for their lunch buffet, which includes salt cod crouuettes and Galician specialties like Cocido Gallego (think well-seasoned New England boiled dinner and add an entire butcher shop), They also serve an excellent paella campesino, which replaces seafood with lamb, sausage and chicken. 

The meat dishes are spectacular and very filling, giving you a good excuse to practice the Spanish tradition of the siesta after your meal. However, as with most buffets, the fish and seafood tend to be tough and dry. If you really want to savor El Gallegazo's perfectly prepared seafood, I suggest you order it a la carte. 

Nevertheless, there are enough non-seafood dishes in the buffet to leave you satisfied. The lunch buffet is about $13 and includes dessert and bottle of wine or pitcher of sangria for parties or a glass of either for individual diners.

There is also a tapas bar that serves cold cuts, cheeses, croquettes, house cured sardines (boquerones), and small portions of any dish. This is where the men of the community gather to discuss politics, soccer and social issues, as well as to share  good food and a few glasses of exceptional Spanish wine. 

El Gallegazo is truly a gem in the Miami restaurant scene and a taste of authentic and original Hispanic culture and cuisine. Once you eat here, you won't be fooled again by cheap Latin American copies.
