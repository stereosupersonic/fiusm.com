Headline: Drinking game makes Address bearable
Author: Jonathan Banke / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It is one of the most important and influential speeches our Commander-in-Chief can make.  Hundreds of millions of people tune in to hear which direction the leader of the free world is going to take his nation next. 

Many times, the State of the Union address has served as a platform for our president to recognize our countries heroes, propose new laws, and even to declare war.  It is a tradition rooted as deep as any in America's history.  

Many college students on this campus and around the country watch to find out the state of our union. Other college students, however, tune in for other reasons.

Tuesday, January 20th was the date of this year's speech.  My roommates decided that they would indeed watch the address, but in a much different way than usual.

They set up a drinking game with all kinds of rules and conditions to go along with the presidents words and gestures. At 9 p.m., off they went when they heard the words, "Mr. Speaker, the president of the United States!"  It was at that point that I knew they would be in for a rough night.

As President Bush walked into the chamber, one person hummed the tune to "Hail to the Chief" while everyone else chugged the entire time.  They repeated the process until everyone had a turn with the song. 

Right after they finished this rule, they noticed the president greet one of the members of Congress in Spanish. As I sat to the side and read their list, I noticed that any time the President spoke in Spanish it was four sips. He hadn't even reached the stage and all of them were already going for another beer.

The speech always has a countless number of standing ovations from the members of Congress. Every time our nation's representatives stood to their feet and clapped, my roommates stood to their feet and drank. 

I was listening intently to this serious address our president was giving, but frankly I was having more fun watching my roommates get hammered. About halfway through the speech, the standing up and drinking the entire time turned more into stumbling off the couch and spilling beer all over themselves. 

The best was yet to come.

The rules they had in place called for them to sip for certain words the president used.  "Terror" for example, was a popular word they had to drink to, as was "evil."  Whenever he used "evil", they all slapped the table and screamed "Down with Evil!" 

Every country President Bush named was a drink also.  I remember as they started yelling at him to stop his speech when he named fourteen countries in a row late in the address.  

Any form of the word "tax" was a sip, two for any reference to "Weapons of Mass Destruction."  Whenever Mrs. Bush was on camera, that was two sips, and whenever the president introduced a special guest, they all had to welcome the special guest themselves and take a sip in their honor.  Since not welcoming someone is rude, if they did not mutter their welcome greeting, they had to pound an entire beer.  I saw this happen multiple times throughout the address. Towards the end of the night, the cameras showed a member of Congress from New York sleeping.  My roommate who called for this rule to be in place was so happy to see someone sleeping that he started doing this crazy dance, flopping around the living room like a wounded duck.  I sat back and laughed thinking that all of them were insane. I asked them why they got smashed on a Tuesday night when they had class the following morning, drinking 26 beers in about 50 minutes.  

One of them said that this only happens once a year, and that the drinking game was an "American tradition."  I believe what he meant was that the speech was an American tradition, but I understood what he was trying to say. 

So next January when you listen in as our president gives the State of the Union, remember there is someone, somewhere on a college campus out there watching the same thing as you but in a completely different way.

Headline: Photographer Abelardo Morell to visit FIU
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Renowned Cuban-American photographer Abelardo Morell will open his first retrospective exhibit in Miami at the Frost Art Museum on Jan. 16.  To kick off the exhibit, Vision Revealed: Selections from the Work of Abelardo Morell, he will be speaking as part of the XXIII Steven and Dorothea Green Critics' Lecture Series on the opening evening.


He will be discussing his life and work experiences as a photographer in America, as well as several of his photographs, which will be on display.
"The Frost Art Museum at FIU is honored to present Morell's first retrospective piece in Miami. Also, we are proud to host Morell, a Cintas Fellow, since the Frost Art Museum houses the Oscar B. Cintas Fellows collection," said Dahlia Morgan, director of the Frost Art Museum at FIU.
Morell attended Yale University for his MFA in photography in 1979, only 17 years after fleeing Cuba with his family to live in New York.


Before attending Yale, Morell received a scholarship to attend Bowdoin College in Maine, where he first enrolled in a basic photography course and discovered his new inner talent in the field. His newfound calling in life gave him a medium to express his feelings and experiences of moving to a new country and being foreign.


"Photography has always been my way of thinking," said Morell in a recent press release, "putting some thoughts together in a stretch - enough to make the picture ask questions, philosophical questions about the world."


His work has now been featured and exhibited by major museums around the world including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney, the Metropolitan and the Art Institute of Chicago. Morell was awarded a fellowship by the Oscar B. Cintas Foundation in 1992 and recieved the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 1993. He is currently a professor at the Massachusets College of Art.


Morell's opening lecture will take place on Jan 16. at 8 p.m. at the Green Library in room 100. The exhibit will run through March 14, 2004. All Frost Art Museum events are free and open to the public. For more information please visit www.frostartmuseum.org.

Headline: National Book Award winner shares childhood memories
Author: Javier Ruiz / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Carlos Eire, winner of the prestigious National Book Award, sits in the audience as Elly Chovel, chairperson of Operation Pedro Pan Group, winds up her introduction of the author and his non-fiction book, "Waiting for Snow in Havana." 


Eire takes off his wristwatch and fidgets with the bands, twirling the watch in his fingers. 


He seems nervous, but intermittently looks up from the watch in his hands to hear Chovel speak. She recounts her memories of being a little girl fleeing Cuba as a child of Pedro Pan, an operation that brought 14,000 unaccompanied children, Eire among them, to the United States from that island.  And with those memories, Eire's nervousness fades. 


He appears almost childlike, amazed. Amazed with the success of the book, the prestige of the award, the podium, and the packed Graham Center Ballroom. As though these things were a work of fiction.


On Jan. 9, Eire spoke about the book and how he came to write it and conducted a question and answer session. The Cuban Research Institute and Operation Pedro Pan sponsored the event. Eire is the T. Lawrasson Riggs Professor of History and Religious Studies at Yale University. He currently lives in Guilford, Conn., with his wife, Jane, and their three children. 


Carlos Eire is haunted by history and fantasy. Haunted by his past, and a past far removed from his experiences. 


As a boy, he wanted to escape from the Paredon - a large wall where enemies of the Cuban revolution were put to death - and the "rivers of blood" of the revolution. He sheltered himself with his imagination. 


He describes his favorite childhood movie, "The Vikings," a 1958 movie that starred Kirk Douglas and Ernest Borgnine. "The movie started me thinking that maybe, maybe, it would be better to live somewhere else." 
He reads from his book and wistfully describes a "pale, Nordic sunset, mind you. Not a bright tangerine sunset. Nordic Fantasies in Havana." 
Even his chosen profession, as a professor of ancient history, led him away from his own history. "I choose to become a historian, a period of history that is pretty far from Cuban history." 


"I had spent most of my life trying to forget about Cuba...I spent a lot of time and put a lot of effort, into distancing myself as much from my memories as possible, because so many them were too painful," he says. 


But that changed in the year 2000, when a series of personal events together with the Elian Gonzalez incident unleashed a torrent of memories.


"Elian in a very odd, very strange, very powerful way opened the door to my memories," Eire says. Soon after, he began work on the book.


The historian, who has written several other scholarly texts, found that "the narrative had taken over [him]." The result was his "first book without footnotes." That wasn't the only first for Eire. His memoir's rampant success has made him the first Cuban-American to win the National Book Award.


Admittedly a shy person, hesitant to share his experiences with others, Eire wavered on whether to publish the book as a work of fiction or non-fiction, ultimately publishing it as a non-fiction.


At the question-and-answer session, the audience is eager to participate. But few ask questions. They instead come to the microphone with their own memories, as faded as the Kodachrome photos one audience member proudly displays. Memories of Havana streets, bus drivers, and teachers they had in common with the author. And the audience members wear expressions much like Eire did listening to Chovel speak: child-like and amazed.


Damian J. Fernandez, director of the Cuban Research Institute, can see why: "This book makes an insular story, a very personal story, a universal and collective human story. That is the power of this book: It speaks across cultures. These people can identify with the experiences of this writer."

Headline: Greeks: A brief history of fraternities in America
Author: Anamirella Marquez/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The first fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, was founded in the University of Williams and Mary in 1776. The general purpose of a fraternity was to expand the social, scholastic, and professional interest of the members. 
Three Greek letters symbolized their organization; memberships were invitation only and they were known as a secret society.

Fraternities and sororities today are not secret societies anymore, however they carry many of the traditions and rituals used hundreds of years ago.
  	
Fraternities created secret grips, motto, rituals, a code of laws, a distinctive badge, and chapter houses that were later adopted by women when they created the sorority, which came from the Latin word soror meaning sister. The first Sorority, Gamma Phi Beta, was founded in Syracuse University in 1874.  

Phi Beta Kappa and Gamma Phi Beta were later transformed into honor societies making Kappa Alpha Society the oldest fraternity, founded in 1825, and Alpha Delta Pi the oldest sorority, founded in 1851. 
Many more fraternities and sororities were created and followed thereafter into a whole new generation.

According to "The American Fraternity" an article written by Betty Mullins Jones, the Greek association in fraternities and sororities comes from the fact that all the early members studied Greek as an academic requirement.  

In the 18th and 19th centuries education was the single most important part of a student's life; there were very few if any recreations, said Jones. "Fraternities filled the void felt by many students who needed an outlet from their studies."  

In 1854, because of their high enrollment, the Chi Psi chapter in the University of Michigan built the first fraternity house.  
Fraternity houses transformed these social-academic organizations into family-like units, changing some of the traditions.  
Chapter homes had its disadvantages, as well as advantages.

According to Jones, the advantages of fraternity houses were that they strengthened the society by building tighter bonds, discipline, and activities. However, the fraternities had to maintain the property that was owned by the school.

In 1902, sororities created the National Pan Hellenic Conference that entitled women to form rules and agreements to abide by as sisters, said Jones. Fraternities however did not have set rules. 

Today fraternities and sororities take in new members  through a process of initiation. During this time the students are called pledges.  
Once a member is initiated, the fraternity or sorority unveils  secret rituals and traditions, according to  Jones.

Headline: Fraternity resurfaces just in time for spring
Author: C. Joel Marino/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As spring semester opens, most returning students are aware of the changes and novelties that they'll soon encounter: new classes, new faces, new activities and schedules. However, to many considering the Greek life as a new alternative for this term, it might come as a welcomed surprise that, with support from the Interfraternity Council, a respected fraternity is preparing to resurface at FIU: Lambda Chi Alpha.

Led by a core group of mostly residential students, the members of Lambda Chi are enthusiastic to bring back a Greek organization which, though once found on campus, was disbanded a few years ago due to failure of communication between its president and the then-head of the IFC.

"These are new people coming in, with new ideas and a new face for the chapter," says current president Aurelio Rivera. Though the reputation of the previous group may not have been up to standards, the facts that Lambda Chi Alpha is both the youngest of the top twenty fraternities in the country and the third largest in the world were enough reasons to attempt a fresh start.

Other reasons have attracted the over 20 members of the community, some of whom even admit that they had never thought of going Greek in college. Since joining the original committee in charge of opening the chapter early last semester, Andres Camacho states that he's enjoyed a level of friendship and brotherhood in the past few months that he wouldn't have expected to find in college. "Though we're still small, it always feels like a family, and like all families, sometimes you don't get along, or sometimes you get along with them great-but it's the good times that make you thankful for having all those guys with you by your side."

Sophomore Ryan Little confesses what drove him to his choice after scouting through various already established Greek chapters. "We have people from different countries, from different states; we're all into different things, and it gives us more of a strong bond. We're together because we want to get to know each other. That's what sets us apart from other fraternities: our diversity is the key to Lambda Chi."

First sponsored by IFC as an interest group, the members of Lambda Chi Alpha are currently undergoing a colonization process in which they must fulfill certain goals set by their national advisory board for a period of twelve months. Once all has been accomplished, they will be established as a fixed fraternity chapter along with FIU's current 28 social fraternities and sororities.

"All the people who become members in these semesters are considered founding fathers, which is a definite plus of starting a fraternity," says Little, who encourages all interested students to join as soon as possible. 

"Also, our plan for associate members is a thing many fraternities do not have," he said, referring to a policy eliminating the pledge class in which all members up for bid enjoy the equal rights of elder brothers, even the possibility of holding office.

As they await new posts to fill up their ranks, all members are confident that, despite the long process ahead of them, their fraternity will bring a dynamics to the campus which will be felt by all.  Camacho said, "Like every other project you embark on life, we've had our ups and downs-but definitely the ups outweigh the downs one-hundred to one."

Headline: Greek Organizations connect students, campus life
Author: Sheaon Reid/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There is more than one way to get involved on campus. There are student clubs such as the West Indian Student Association, Club Energy and Caribbean Student Association, student organizations such as Student Government Council, Student Programming Council and Student Organizations Council. Last but not least, you can get involved by joining a Greek organization.

Social Greek organizations have a long history in the United States, but are relatively recent to FIU. The first chapter, Phi Beta Sigma, began at FIU in 1978. 

Currently, there are 28 social fraternities and sororities at FIU ranging from Alpha Kappa Alpha to Zeta Phi Beta. The fraternities and sororities are divided into the three governing councils-National Pan-Hellenic Council, Pan-Hellenic Council  and Inter-fraternity Council. 

Phi Sigma Sigma, established in 1984, was the first  sorority that would constitute the Pan-Hellenic Council, which governs the women's groups. 
Sigma Phi Epsilon, in 1985, became the first men's fraternity that would constitute the Inter-fraternity Council, which governs the men's groups. 

Phi Beta Sigma in 1978 was the first Black Greek chapter that led to the founding of the National Pan-Hellenic Council, which governs African-American fraternities and sororities.  

Recruitment activities for the chapters usually occur throughout the academic year. Pan-Hellenic coordinates a Fall Recruitment period. IFC hosts Formal Recruitment in the Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters. in fact, Jan. 12 marks the start of their official recruitment period. NPHC chapters conduct their own recruitment periods individually. This process is known as Member Intake.

The mission of the Greek community at FIU is to develop leaders by providing an avenue of service, scholarship, athletics, and social relations while motivating each individual to strive for excellence. 

Another mission of the Greek community is to foster life long relationships by creating common bonds between the members of respected organizations and to encourage school spirit and Greek awareness by using the Greek system as a base to reach out to the rest of the student body.

As the first established sorority at FIU, Phi Sigma Sigma was founded on November 26, 1913 and today maintains 110 active collegiate chapters throughout the United States and Canada including FIU. The open motto for Phi Sigma Sigma is "diokete hupsala" meaning aim high.

Sigma Phi Epsilon was founded at Richmond College, now University of Richmond, on Nov. 1, 1901 on the cardinal principles of virtue, diligence, and brotherly love. These principles still hold true for FIU Sigma Phi Epsilon members. 

There is more to fraternities and sororities than just social activities. Fraternities and sororities also participate in community service projects, and educational programs. Fraternities and sororities are committed to the overall development of their members, encompassing academic, athletic, and personal enhancement. 

Most organizations have a set of requirements that their new members must follow to be initiated, or fully recognized as a lifetime member of the fraternity or sorority. 

"Most Greek organizations require you to have at least a 3.0 GPA," said Karen Katz, Assistant Director of Campus Life for Greek Affairs. "They also require that you are a fully enrolled undergraduate student registered with at least 9 credit hours." 

Moreover, new members must attend meetings, participate in community service opportunities, plan a social event, and pay their financial obligations once accepted into the organization.

Headline: Online shoppers save on textbooks this spring
Author: Tara Kane/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Ouch. The required textbook for your Intro to Psych course costs $69.
Worry not, oh seekers of a higher education. For the Web-savvy, the credit-worthy, and the just-plain-resourceful, there are lower-cost options.

The university bookstore charges just over $50 for a used version. But you can do a lot better than that.

The same textbook can be had online through a host of fee-based auction services for around $40. And there's even a website that helps you identify someone at your school with whom to bargain directly, or perhaps arrange a swap.

New William Paterson University student Marianna Proctor and her mother, Beatrice, were surprised to hear of cost-saving ways to buy the armful of books required of freshmen at the school. They had just paid $51.75 for a used version of "Understanding Psychology."

But they had a question. Without the bookstore's handy required-reading list supplied by the professors, how would they have known what books to get? Ah, the marvels of the digital age. Many college bookstores are linked to Efollett.com, where students with course numbers can find the books they need.

The site lists the bookstore's prices for new and used books, and offers shipping for extra.

But as the Proctors learned, you can do better than the bookstore, even for used books. The same used textbook that Marianna bought costs $36.95 on Amazon.com. 

Other websites such as, Getcheapbooks.com, Ecampus.com and Directtextbook.com also offer used texts for less.

How? Because there is no middleman. The bookstore buys its used texts from students, who often will happily accept any cash offer. That way, the store makes much of its profit off the sale of used books.
The online services make their money by charging a fee, usually between $2 and $5 over the sale price.

The downside to purchasing online is that it requires a credit card, and shipping fees can be costly. That's why, last year, college grad Ben Wilson founded Screwthebookstore.com  a free, online book exchange that matches buyers and sellers from the same school. "It lets students directly negotiate a price and eliminate the bookstore," said Wilson, 24.

Most campus bookstores don't feel the online competition is hurting business.

There are still plenty of students, such as WPU junior Lauren Marcianiak, who prefer the old-fashioned way.

"I don't have a credit card," Marcianiak said. "For me, the bookstore is just easier."

Headline: Men's basketball gets off to rough start in conference play
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Jan. 3- ASU 55, FIU 46

After suffering a 1-13 record in conference play last season, FIU head men's basketball coach Donnie Marsh was eager to begin Sun Belt play and turn things around with a home meeting against Arkansas State.

But things didn't go according to plan as FIU struggled offensively, shooting only 35 percent from the field and 50 percent from the free throw line, en route to a 55-46 loss to ASU in front of 332 fans at the Golden Panther Arena on Jan. 3.

Despite forcing 20 turnovers on defense, the Golden Panthers negated the feat with 19 turnovers of their own.

FIU kept the game close in the first half and trailed 22-20 at halftime, but the Indians pulled away with a 9-0 run five minutes into the second half. Seven of the nine points were scored by J.J. Montgomery, who led all scorers with 22 points on the night.

ASU increased its lead to 14 at 50-36 with just over three minutes to play in the game, its largest lead of the night. FIU cut the lead to single digits with a minute to play, but that was as close as they would get.

The Golden Panthers continued to struggle from the free line, making only 9 of 18 attempts.

Guard Marcus Robinson was the only Golden Panther to finish the game in double-digits with 15 points. 

FIU's starting lineup struggled on the night offensively. Harry Lum, Taurance Johnson and Raphael DaSilva combined for only 13 points.

Despite a poor performance offensively, Marsh saw the positives on the defensive side of the ball.

"Our defensive effort was good. We held a team that averages 78 points to 55 points, but we didn't get the offensive performance from our key guys," Marsh told The Miami Herald after the game.

Two regular starters, Junior Matias and Carlos Morban, were not available for the game. Matias is suffering from back problems that will require surgery. Marsh suspended Morban for the game due to the three technical fouls he received over the previous three games.

FIU fell to 3-9 (0-1 Sun Belt) with the loss.

Jan. 6- UALR 65, FIU 53

The recipe for disaster has been the same for the Golden Panthers all season: Poor free throw shooting and poor ball handling equals a loss. 

Game two of conference play for FIU was no different as the team shot 50 percent from the line and committed 19 turnovers for the second straight game, falling to Arkansas-Little Rock 65-53 at the Golden Panther Arena on Jan. 6.

Early on, it appeared FIU's bad fortune at the stripe was going to change, as center Byron Burnett connected on a pair of free throws to give the Golden Panthers a 2-0 lead.

But the team failed to follow his example, converting on only 4-of-10 attempts after that.

The FIU offense struggled with the Trojans' full court press early and fell behind 20-8 with 10 minutes remaining in the first half. FIU entered the break trailing 37-23.

At halftime, head coach Donnie Marsh was forced to challenge his defense to focus on stopping the Trojans - specifically UALR players Brandon Freeman and Jamal Holden, who combined for 30 of the Trojans' 37 first half points. Alone, Freeman and Holden outscored FIU 30-23 in the first half.

"Two guys we knew would be scoring for them, and we did not do a good job of clamping down on those guys in the first half. Freeman and Holden outscored us by themselves," said Marsh. "I told them that we had to stop those guys. I needed two guys to step up and say 'I want the challenge to cover these guys' and not allow them to touch the ball," Marsh said.

	Marsh's speech at halftime proved worthy as FIU came out strong in the second half. After a couple of dunks by Burnett, the Golden Panthers began an offensive and defensive show behind guards Marcus Robinson and Harry Lum, cutting the lead from 14 to five, at 43-38, with 12 minutes to go in the game. 

The crowd, which was quiet throughout most of the game, finally made some noise after three monster dunks by Burnett.

"Anytime you get nice plays like that, it brings up your team intensity because everyone wants to play a little bit harder," Burnett said.

	Added Robinson: "The dunk that he did on whoever it was really sparked us."

	Robinson finished the game with 16 points and shot 4-of-10 from three point land.

But despite the hot three- point shooting from Robinson, FIU was unable to get any closer than five points. With eight minutes to go, the Trojans widened their lead to 53-40. Despite holding UALR to 6-of-24 shooting from the field in the second half, FIU was unable to score enough points to overcome the deficit. 

	"We dug ourselves in too much of a hole in the first half and just couldn't get out of it," said Marsh.

	"We tried to play catch up, but the hole was to big and it seemed as if we just ran out of gas," said Lum, who finished the game with 12 points on a perfect 6-for-6 shooting from the field.

	But it all came down to Freeman and Holden's first half play, which was ultimately too much for FIU to overcome.

"We let those two guys beat us in the first half and by the time we had our run in the second half it was just too late. It was the first half that killed us," said Robinson.

	FIU also came up short with untimely turnovers and erratic shooting down the stretch.

"When we made the comeback, we kept throwing the ball away. We need to understand our bread and butter in that situation and it was to go to Burnett, who was creating problems for them. We had to attack the basket and we didn't make good decisions," said Marsh.

But the one positive for FIU was the consistent play from Burnett, who will need to establish himself as a leader in the paint if the Golden Panthers plan to make some noise in the Sun Belt.

	"He has clearly been the most improved guy for us, and [he has] not just improved, but [he has] also been the most consistent player throughout the stretch," Marsh said.

	With the loss, FIU dropped to 3-10 and 0-2 in the Sun Belt Conference.

	Both Carlos Morban and Taurence Johnson were scratched from the starting lineup for the game. Morban was punished for excessive technical fouls and Johnson came off the bench as a strategic move by Marsh.

Headline: 17-0... and counting
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Q: You've gone two seasons at FIU without losing a single game and now stand at 17-0 for your college career. Explain how that feat is even possible.

A: Being surrounded by good players, a lot of hard work and some luck.

Q: What is more crucial to winning baseball games, strong pitching or timely hitting?

A: I would have to go with both, if I am allowed. 

Q: Are there any hitters on an opposing lineup that Derek DeCarlo fears?

A: I wouldn't call it fear, but I could call it respect. I have faced a few hitters that I definitely respect.

Q: After missing parts of the past two seasons, what is it going to take for you to stay injury-free and off the bench this season?
A: Hard work in the training room and weight room. Mike Pawlusiak, our team trainer, has helped alot.

Q: How much did it hurt you the past two seasons to not be able to contribute down the stretch because of injuries?

A: Last year was a bit different than the year before. Last year I was switched to a reliever so I was able to contribute to the team. The year before I wasn't able to pitch in the playoffs, so of course it bothered me to just sit and watch.

Q: With the injuries you sustained last season, it was nice to have a guy like Josh Banks to carry the load. If you were to go down this year, which guy do you think is capable of leading this pitching staff?

A: Let's not talk about anyone going down, but since you asked there are a few guys that can get the job done no matter what.

&nbsp;
Jan. 4 - FIU 66, UALR 57

FIU began conference play the way it wanted to with a convincing 66-57 road victory over Arkansas Little-Rock at Trojan Fieldhouse in Little Rock on Jan. 4.

The Golden Panthers were led offensively by Ivelina Vrancheva (19 points), Milena Tomova (12 points) and Allison Bustamante (11 points), who were the only Golden Panthers to score in double-figures.

FIU also dominated the boards, outrebounding the Trojans 31-23, led by Tomova, who had 12.

The Golden Panthers started off the game hot, with a three-pointer from Vrancheva giving FIU an early 3-0 lead. FIU continued with a 17-0 run that lasted over six minutes midway through the first half and led 36-28 at halftime.

FIU's lead was cut to six, but the Golden Panthers responded with a 12-2 run and led 55-37 with just over eight minutes to go.

The loss for the Trojans was their first at home this season. FIU improved to 9-0 lifetime against UALR. However, it was the first time FIU had not beaten UALR by double digits, averaging 21.8 points per victory since the teams began playing each other.

FIU improved to 7-7, (1-0 Sun Belt) with the victory.

Jan. 6- ASU 62, FIU 60

The Golden Panthers, looking to  stay undefeated in conference play, came up just short, falling 62-60 to Arkansas State on the road Jan. 6.

FIU had a chance to win the game, but Ivelina Vrancheva's three point attempt missed and Milena Tomova's game-tying layup attempt also missed the mark as time expired. 

The Lady Indians were led by Adrianne Davie and Amber Abraham, who combined for 31 points, helping the Lady Indians end FIU's three-game winning streak.

FIU trailed 37-22 at halftime and responded with a 7-0 run in the second half to cut the lead to nine at 37-28. But ASU responded with an 8-0 run of its own. 

But FIU rallied again, capped by a three-pointer by Allison Bustamante, which cut the lead to 61-60 with 15.3 seconds remaining.

ASU's Davis then hit one of two free throws for a 62-60 lead before Vrancheva's three-pointed missed the mark.

Tomova led FIU with 14 points and 10 rebounds as the Golden Panthers fell to 7-8 (1-1 Sun Belt) on the season.

Headline: Basketball second nature for Robinson
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For point guard Marcus Robinson, playing basketball is as easy as tying his shoe or as normal a ritual as breathing - always has been.

As a young kid, Robinson would watch his father, Hal Lee, play collegiate basketball at New Mexico State and later his brother Mike at Point Loma University. With basketball in his blood, Robinson is now living his dream of playing college basketball for the Golden Panthers under head coach Donnie Marsh.

"My dad use to always play ball and even when he got older, he would play games with me and my brother. I grew up with the ball in my hand passing and bouncing it everywhere I went. Now I'm the last in the family to carry the ball," said Robinson.

After two years of playing at South Mountain Community College in Arizona, Robinson elected FIU over top schools in the country, particularly Dayton University.

"I chose FIU because it's a really good school. I liked the staff, area and the weather because it's the best down here," said Robinson, who was the leading scorer in NCAA Division II last season with 24.6 points per game.

Becoming a Golden Panther has changed Robinson's game play on the court. Upon signing, Marsh let Robinson know that coming here would signify a change in his style by playing more of a point guard rather than his natural shooting guard position. Robinson accepted the challenge despite not playing point guard since his junior year of high school.

"What we have asked Marcus to do is to change his game a little bit and concern himself more with getting his teammates involved more before himself," said Marsh. "He has done a good job with that adjustment because everywhere he has been, he's been able to put up a lot of shots."

"It's a different, tougher position because it brings a lot more added responsibility. This season I have had my good moments and then my bad moments, but hopefully I will finish the season with more of the good," said Robinson.

Playing point guard has taken away some of Robinson's natural scoring ability but lately Marsh has put Robinson in the off guard position where he plays both positions throughout the game.

"When I am running the two [shooting guard], I try and be more offensive minded by scoring more rather then when I play the point where I try and find my teammates open. I just go out there and keep an optimistic attitude and I know I will adapt sooner or later," said, Robinson who is averaging 10.7 points per game this season.  

Marsh believes his scoring ability attracts and demands attention, creating other opportunities for Robinson's teammates.

"Opposing defenses have to worry more about him because he can score," said Marsh, who believes Robinson's biggest attribution to the team this season has been his shooting ability, especially beyond the arc.

Being away from home, Robinson can get a little home sick.

Especially because his hometown of Mesa, Arizona is over 2,000 miles away. 

A regular day for Robinson can be hectic with two-a-day practices, study hall time and classes. But he knows this is the life a basketball player chooses and he has learned to accept it.

"This particular lifestyle is not for every person because it does take a toll on the body. People think that student athletes have it easier, but they are wrong. We have school, practices, study time and then more practice. Whenever we have some time off, I just try and sleep because it does wear you down after a while," said Robinson.

When things get tough both on and off the court, Robinson always has coach to talk too. Marsh, along with the rest of the coaching staff,  has made it an easy transition for him.

"Coach Marsh has a lot of patience with us. Instead of yelling at us he teaches us the game and I am thankful for that patience he has. He is a real good coach but an even better person," said Robinson.

Despite being a newcomer to the Sun Belt Conference, Robinson has big goals for this season. 

"As an individual I would like to become the Sun Belt Conference Newcomer of the Year along with making it to one of the three All-Sun Belt teams. As a team, I would love for us to make it to the NCAA tournament by making some noise in our conference. We have a few losses right now but conference play is what matters and if we can get it together as a group, no one will stop us," said Robinson.

But Robinson's goals don't stop at FIU and in the Sun Belt Conference. He has his eyes on the big prize, even if that prize seems miles away - the NBA.

"I'm going to do this even though I know it's going to be a long road ahead. I know I might not get drafted but my goal is to play overseas and play well enough to have a chance for a summer workout with a team in the NBA. I believe in my future and with [a] hard work ethic, I will live my dream. I know there will always be bad times, but the key is to keep my eye on the prize."

Headline: Baseball 'doing things differently' to avoid injury in '04
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Last season, the FIU baseball team missed the NCAA Regionals for the first time in seven years, mostly because of key injuries to the starting pitching staff.

This season, however, the team is taking new strides to avoid that problem in hopes of getting back to the postseason.

"We want to get back to the playoffs. That's what we play for, but we know we've got to be healthy down the stretch," said Bill Abrams, Assistant to Baseball Operations

How do they plan on doing this?

One attempt has been a change in coaching techniques.

After the resignation of longtime assistant coach Rolando Casanova, FIU brought in former Arizona State University bench coach, Chris Holick, to work on flexibility and conditioning and the players say he is making a big difference.

"He does a lot of conditioning, stretching, plyometric work, everything. He brought in a new system this year and it's really working out good for everybody, getting everybody strong," said junior pitcher Derek DeCarlo.

Holick is anxious to see if his efforts will help this team stay healthy and improve.

"I've been working with the conditioning of the players and the hitters and we've been doing a lot of everything, so we'll see if it makes a difference," Holick said. 

Head coach Danny Price credited the new coach for his efforts, but knows that the team must come together to get where they want to go.

"The biggest thing is that it's a positive flow. It's new blood, new energy, but I feel really good. A lot of it's still in place. What we are trying to do is continue to build this program. I don't think you can ever say one coach makes as big as a difference as one player does. It takes a team," Price said.

DeCarlo believes the team needs to get in the right frame of mind in addition to the new training techniques.

"Last year the whole mental attitude of our team was totally not where it needed to be. This year we got the new coach so I think we've changed things up from the beginning - the way we do our conditioning, the way we run things - so it's a lot different and I think it's gonna be good to see what's gonna happen this year," DeCarlo said.

Price thinks a new approach couldn't hurt, after dealing with key injuries for the past two seasons.

"Last year we had some key injuries, so we've tried to a better job with our flexibility program, but our strength program is still in place the same way it's been," Price said.

"I think conditioning wise we are doing some things differently," Price said. "Are we in better shape? I don't know, but are we doing things differently, are we really stressing flexibility and those types of things?" Price asked. "I think we are."

Last season, the team played much of the season without starting pitchers DeCarlo and Andrew Edwards, but both are healthy and ready to contribute this year.

"Andrew Edwards must have had over 60 scouts looking at him on opening day [two seasons ago], but he's back, he's healthy and ready to go," said Abrams. "Derek's never lost a game in his college career and he's back and ready to go. He's looked great so far and has one of the best curveballs I've ever seen."

With DeCarlo and Edwards healthy, Price knows he has the foundation to a team that can be very special.

"Both of those guys look great. We're in pretty good shape this year. The whole key to it is staying healthy, which is something we didn't do last year and it really put our backs up against the wall. If we can stay away from injuries, we'll be in good shape," Price said.

And if healthy, DeCarlo is the guy this team wants leading them in crunch time. After two seasons, DeCarlo has yet to lose a game, compiling a 17-0 record over the stretch. Asked if he ever plans on losing a game, a smiling DeCarlo responded, "Hopefully I'll get it over with early this year, but no, I'll try not to."

If he keeps that streak alive another season, this team could be tough to beat - but only if he and his teammates stay healthy.

Big ups to Radiate 88

To the Editor:

As a frequent reader of The Beacon, I thought I would take it upon myself to write to you in response to the guest appearance of Crashing Tide, a well known Miami local band, on Radiate 88 this last Sunday.  I will not lie; I never listen to the school's radio station, but I will tell you that I did listen to this whole two hour interview without even such an idea as a bathroom break. Never have I heard a more genuine and pleasant group with such music of professional caliber. Crashing Tide is very well known among the FIU student community because of all the shows they have played across campus for Greek organizations and different charities. On the top of my list is definitely their performance in the Golden Panther Arena, along side two other local acts as they together made the opening act for Ludacris last year. I was very impressed with the positive feedback given by your staff in the following weeks reviews.  I guess one may say that the purpose of this letter is to simply shine some well deserved light on a group of individuals who love what they do, and will stop at nothing to accomplish their goals and dreams. Radiate 88 has definitely found their undiscovered talent and FIU should be proud to have them amongst their student body.

Headline: Arts don't compromise on good, evil
Author: Stanley Crouch / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
If 2004 can find its own way and not repeat the worst of 2003, then I will say that it is good being here. 

But it's always doubtful that mistakes of whatever sort will be understood so soon, though there are always those who talk as though immediate understanding is a common trait and that those who do not understand are just being unwilling. Such people are usually academics and asses. So much for them.

Of course, as we move into this new year, we still find ourselves in a world where those who run the popular entertainment industry do not take any responsibility. 

They continue to stack their money on the most corrosive possible trash and pretend that we cannot make any correlation between what comes at teenagers from every direction and what our kids make of it.

Yet there is clearly a yearning out in the world for something that will rise above this mess, even if it is exhibited in the popularity of the Harry Potter movies, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and "The Matrix" series. 

These films have in common an idea of good that is not relative, of courage that is not relative, of compassion that is not relative and of evil that is very far from relative.

Whether or not I subscribe to any of the values and ideas in those films, I do find it important that audiences across this nation and around the globe, far from expressing a desire for fascism, are celebrating the versions of morality that are found in them.

I also appreciate that audiences do not believe that civilization survives without certain people stepping up to protect it from those things that threaten it. 

None of the real threats, by the way, has anything to do with the supposed villains - long hair, loud guitars, trashy female behavior, Third World religions or ethnic groups that are not white. 

Greed and religious fundamentalism seem the best candidates for the top of the list, and neither is showing any inclination of slacking off. 

So in this new year, let us commend all those people in the arts who have not sold out, no matter the pressure; all those people in government who actually attempt to make the best decisions; all those in the military who maintain readiness and a willingness to do what is often the most difficult of jobs; all those in the teaching profession who actually pass on the substance of our civilization; all those in the medical profession who struggle every day against pain and death, and all those in law enforcement who seem to stand taller with each passing day.

As for the rest of you, Happy New Year. See you here next year.

Headline: Dr. Dean campaign lacking bedside manner
Author: Myriam Marquez / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Howard Dean decided to study medicine to help people, yet there's no kind bedside manner to this doc - at least not on the stump for the presidency.

He's the Democratic version of the Angry White Male. A peacenik with a brash, shoot-from-the-lip attitude.

His anger at everything Republican surely inspires the Democratic Party left-leaning base, but national elections haven't been won by the Democrats' left wing in decades. The expectation is that Dean will energize young people and disaffected independents who haven't voted before.

Sorry, but most of America is middle of the road, worried about terror but certainly not hopping mad. 

Look at California's recent gubernatorial election. Arnold Schwarzenegger won as a Republican who's conservative on fiscal issues, but supports abortion rights and gay rights, including civil unions that stop short of the volatile "gay marriage" label. 

The political Arnold isn't the cinematic Angry White Male he portrayed on the big screen. His wife, Maria Shriver, who came out swinging to support her man after sexual-harassment accusations surfaced against him, painted a softer side to Arnold that stuck with the electorate.

No doubt Dean's platform can be appealing to many working stiffs. As Vermont's governor he showed himself to be a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. 

He wants to fix the health-care mess. 

He wants to roll back tax cuts  that so far have shown no real benefits to the economy to produce more jobs. 

In fact, about 3 million jobs have been lost under Bush's watch, and the tax cuts have contributed to the federal budget deficit, heading for a record $500 billion this year.

What Dean can't seem to do is argue his points in a way that uplifts the middle. His angry image turns off many of us who had hoped for a real race. 

By contrast, President Bush's agenda has turned off many of us independent-minded voters who expected he would respect the controversial 2000 election results by steering a moderate course. Instead, Bush has veered to the far right.

Yet on a personal level, Bush can charm his detractors. Even on the war on terror, as much as I hate his administration's attacks on civil liberties, Bush has talked up unity to deliver divisive policies. 

Dean, by contrast, can't even smile without it looking like an insincere wolf's grin. It's as if his mind is reeling with plots and counter-plots. 

When other Democratic contenders criticize him, Dean has shown he can't take the heat. He pouts. He grimaces. He rails. The only real smiles I've seen are in old pictures of a young and optimistic Dean.

A little humility would be nice. Some self-deprecating humor, as often displayed by Gen. Wesley Clark, sure would be welcome from Dean. 

But he seems to be wound so tight he can't show a softer side - if he has one.

Say what you will about Bill Clinton (and Lord knows I have), but he was able to connect with a lot of people. Remember after another Angry White Man, Newt Gingrich, came to power as speaker of the U.S. House and the 1994 election put Newt's GOP in charge of Congress? Newty was wowed by charming Billy Boy's mea culpas and attempts to find a middle ground on policy.

Dean's schtick revolves around his outsider status. He rails against those members of Congress now running for president who have backed many of Bush's war or tax policies. The way Dean goes about making his case - the constant I told you so's - hardly inspires confidence that a President Dean could negotiate peace with enemies abroad or at home.

Maybe Dick Gephardt will give Dean a run for his money in Iowa. 

Maybe John Kerry can make a difference in New Hampshire. 

Or Clark can wow the South. 

But the odds are that Dean's AWM train won't be stopped by middle-of-the-roaders. 

We're headed for the big crash, and the angry doc gives us little hope.

Headline: A 2004 voter's guide to Bush resume
Subheadline: John Colagrande Jr. /  Staff Columnist
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
2004 is an election year. As Floridians, we have an extra duty as American citizens. If there was anything to learn from the 2000 election it was that every vote counts - especially for residents of Florida. 

It is never too early to make sure you and everyone in your circle is registered to vote.Don't matter who you vote for. Only matters that you vote. From the look of things, a regime change might not be so bad. The following is an annotated resume I stumbled across on the current prez, and is widely available on the Internet.

George Bush's presidential resume:

I am the first U.S. president to have a majority of the people of Europe (71 percent) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and stability.

I dissolved more international treaties than any president in U.S. history.

I am the first president in U.S. history to unilaterally attack a sovereign nation against the will of the United Nations and the world community.

I garnered sympathy for the United States after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the United States the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world.

I withdrew from the World Court of Law.

I set the all-time record for the most people worldwide to simultaneously take to the streets to protest me (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind.

In a little over two years, I created the most divided country in decades. 

I entered office with the strongest economy in U.S. history and in less than two years, every economic category plunged.

I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more than any president in U.S. history, while at the same time proposing tax cuts.

I shattered the record for biggest annual deficit in history.

In my first two years in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs.

I cut healthcare benefits for war veterans.

I am the first president in U.S. history to enter office with a criminal record.

I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to intervene when corruption was revealed.

My biggest lifetime campaign contributor, one of my best friends, presided over one of the largest corporate bankruptcy frauds in world history (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation).

I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton and more time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.

My presidency is the most secretive and unaccountable of any in U.S. history.

I set the record for the fewest press conferences of any president since the invention of television.

In my first year in office, I set the all-time record for the most vacation days taken by any president.

I set the record for most campaign fundraising trips of any president in U.S. history.

I hold the record for most corporate campaign donations.

Members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. (The "poorest" multimillionaire, Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her).

I set all-time records for the number of administration appointees who violated U.S. law by not selling huge investments in corporations bidding for government contracts. Top of the class? VP Dick Cheney and his Halliburton Corp. - awarded, with no bid, the single largest of the multi-billion dollar contracts for the rebuilding of Iraq (paid for out of the U.S. treasury).

I failed to get Osama bin Laden "dead or alive".

I failed to capture the anthrax killer who tried to murder the leaders of our country at the United States Capitol building.

I was AWOL from National Guard. Records from my tenure as governor of Texas are in my father's library, unavailable for public view. 

Records and References: I have at least one conviction for drunk driving in Maine (Texas driving record has been erased and is not available). 

All records of any SEC investigations into my insider trading or bankrupt companies are sealed and unavailable for public view. 

All minutes of meetings for any public corporation I served on the board are sealed and unavailable for public view. 

All records regarding public energy policy are sealed and unavailable for public review. 

For personal references please speak to my daddy, George H.W. Bush, or uncle, James Baker.

Headline: Editorial: Bush immigration stance still leaves much to be desired
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
President Bush's proposed revision of the immigration policy is a step in the right direction, but leaves much to be desired.

Current immigration policy is unable to cope with certain realities: There are some 8 million illegal immigrants in the United States, many of whom support local economies, pay taxes, and are law abiding, even though they are not citizens. Immigration policies tend to treat those people like criminals, in a manner that is unjust and does not reflect the role that immigrants have played in the rise of this nation.

Essentially, the new initiative is painted with broad strokes, culling together aspects of legislation already before congress.

The bill would give undocumented workers several rights previously denied to them:

* It would allow undocumented workers within the United States to claim a three-year work permit which can be renewed for another three years upon expiration, effectively granting a worker a six-year stay in the United States.

* It would allow workers to travel back and forth between the United States and their home nation without fear of being deported. 

* It would allow workers some basic rights such as minimum wage and the ability to report crimes or abuses without fear of deportation.

* It would allow prospective employees outside the United States - who are sponsered by an employer - to enter the United States and enter into this system. Employers would first have to show that no American citizen has taken interest in a position before being allowed to employ a foreign national.

Current policies need to change, and on the face of it, it would appear that the initiative outlined by Bush would offer some positive changes. But there is still room for skepticism.

Currently, some 140,000 green cards are granted every year, and the naturalization process is notoriously slow.  With 8 million illegals  in the states, a long wait is expected, and even six years may not be enough. While Bush encouraged Congress to grant more green cards, he specified no plan to do so.

The plan also appears to favor employers, who now have a legal way to import cheap labor, while making no long term commitments.  

And many view this initiative as an attempt by Bush to improve his approval ratings among Hispanics during an election year. In his previous election, Bush won just one-third of the Hispanic vote. 

U.S. immigration policy does need to be reformed, but instead of quick patch-ups, we need long term solutions that benefit everyone.

Headline: Sleaze rock's Yeah Yeah Yeahs over the top
Author: Dan DeLuca / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
When Nick Zinner met Karen O in a New York bar in 2000, musically speaking, they were polar opposites.


"She was doing very quiet and sorrowful singer-songwriter stuff," remembers the guitarist for New York nuevo-garage-rock avatars the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. "And I had this experimental rock band that was a lot more sonically explorative, and a little hyperanalytical."


The duo tried doing it O's way in a project called Unitard, but found common ground over a drum machine, four-track recorder, and a mutual realization that they wanted to make "sleazy and sexy" music after the manner of the trashy rockabilly archetypes the Cramps.


Along with drummer Brian Chase, Zinner and O played their first gig later that year, opening for Sleater-Kinney and the White Stripes, and were soon labeled leaders of the downtown rock pack, along with the Strokes, Interpol and Liars. 


The hype built with two widely praised EPs, and was largely met with Fever to Tell (Interscope), the impressive 2003 full-length debut packed with primal riffage, courtesy of the charismatic O, high drama that's both arty and anthemic.


Because the only instrument employed by over-the-top show woman O is her arresting voice, and the band has no bass player, Zinner, 28, is free to fill up the YYYs' three-minute-and-less punk nuggets with crunching chords and buzzing effects. 


"It makes you think outside of the box and try to come up with new solutions," says the native Bostonian, talking on the phone from Omaha, Neb., the hometown of acclaimed songwriter Conor Oberst, a. k. a. Bright Eyes, with whom he's been collaborating. "I think it's important to do as much work as you can with other artists, to stretch yourself." 


Zinner, who names Rowland Howard from the Birthday Party, Blixa Bargeld from Einsturzende Neubauten, and Neil Young as favorite guitarists, calls himself a "studio geek" who prefers recording to playing live. "I'd rather do without the traveling, the sound checks, and the getting sick," he says, and claims to be "terrified" by the band's forthcoming gig at the capacious Hammerstein Ballroom in New York, its biggest headlining show ever. 


Anyone who has seen the YYYs perform, though, knows that even if Zinner would rather be home nursing a cold, the trio is a mighty live act. 
That's in large part due to the fashionable O's penchant for unfettered stage theatrics. "She frightens me sometimes," says the guitarist, who says his Lyle Lovett-ish exploding do is the result of "how it looks when I wake up in the morning."


"In Australia last month, we were really losing ourselves in what we were doing, and she was leaning up against a monitor and she fell off the stage." Though no bones were broken, "she busted up her back and head pretty good," Zinner says. 


O, 24, and Zinner have been writing for Fever's follow-up, which they plan to record in the latter half of this year. "We've got about six new songs that we're doing in the set. 


They're darker, more rhythmically oriented. Not so much party songs, which is good. All three of us are excited to be moving in a different direction."

Headline: Frisky Calendar Girls  refreshens mother-daughter flick
Author: Candace McAfee / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"The flowers of Yorkshire are like the women of Yorkshire. The last stage of their growth is the most glorious." 


Keep that quote in mind for Nigel Cole's "Calendar Girls", a cute film from the U.K. about two best friends, Chris and Annie, who decide to doctor the plan for the Women's Institute yearly fundraising calendar. Determined to raise money in memory of Annie's late husband, Chris (nicely played by Helen Mirren) takes the above quote to heart and launches the idea of an all-nude calendar whose proceeds would benefit Leukemia research. 


After a meeting with wine and much coaxing involved, the pair finally get enough ladies involved to complete the calendar. Each month features a member of the WI doing the expected "feminine" pastime (knitting, gardening, baking) with the exception of clothes. Despite the initial protest voiced by the president of the club, the women print the calendar, finding it well received in their little village of Yorkshire-Dales as intended, but also all over the world. The fame and stardom is brought into the town, and the women are soon asked to fly to America for interviews and media spots. 


As in many other rags-to-riches type movies, however, there is a price to the ladies' success. Once in America, the women are propositioned to do a nude ad, cheapening the original intent of their nudity, falling short of pure exploitation. 


The publicity eats away at the private relationships of the group as well; Chris has a family, consisting of a husband and a teenaged son, both of whom suffer the attention of the paparazzi and embarrassment from awkward stares. Another woman copes with her husband's distaste for her photo. The lengthy relationship between Chris and Annie also comes under fire, as Annie (Julie Walters) feels Chris is unappreciative of the husband she still has who loves her and that she neglects. 


The scenes of the ladies preparing for the photo shoot are hysterical; in one scene, a phone chain is set up reminding the women to take off their brassieres at a certain time as to avoid "strap lines". The compelling urge to cheer is overwhelming as each character overcomes their personal obstacles and finds self-love and appreciation. The actors are all extremely convincing and well cast, and the story is heartwarming.


Though the film is very warm and humorous, it still addresses important themes and issues specific to femininity, family, love, body image and aging, in addition to inner strength. 


Based on a true story, "Calendar Girls" is a triumphant tale of a group of women who successfully altered society's standard of beauty and altered the lives of many people in the process. 


Anyone would enjoy this lighthearted film and get many good laughs in the duration, but in all honesty, it would probably be best received by women. "Calendar Girls" is an excellent mother-daughter movie or a "girl's night out" flick.

Headline: Ban on Hijab in France is not in Conformity with  Secularism
Subheadline:  
Author: os21@aol.com
&nbsp;
The recent proposal by the French government to ban religious symbols in public schools has stirred extreme opposition from those the law is targeting. The law's intent is to disallow the wearing of religious symbols in public schools such as Christian crosses, Jewish skullcaps, Islamic headscarves, and Sikh turbans. The justification for the law is to make a clear separation of church and state within the nation of France, a belief held by many in its government that this is the best way to preserve their secular tradition. The French government has characterized the wearing of these religious symbols as being imposing on those who do not adhere to a specific religion or to those who are not religious in nature. 
	The largest voice in protesting against the ban has been from the Muslim community in France, roughly a population of five million. They feel this new law would be a great hindrance to the practicing of faith by Muslim girls who attend public school in France. Wearing the headscarf by Muslim women is not something that can be compromised such as a cross or a skullcap because it is required by Islamic Law. Secularists in France argue that they are actually freeing these young Muslim girls from something they feel is being imposed on them by their faith, so in response they are imposing their own secularist views on these girls. 
	The French government has apparently forgotten its own constitution, which clearly states that their government ensures "the equality of all citizens before law, without distinction of origin, race or religion." Furthermore, the French government has also evidently overlooked the European Convention on Human Rights that it ratified in 1974 where it states that all people have the "freedom to manifest his religion or belief, in
worship, teaching, practice and observance." 
	Some misconceptions about the headscarf in Islam need to be clarified before continuing further. The main one is that it is oppressive to women, and this is what the French government has been arguing. The holy book of Islam, the Qur'an, clearly states that "there is no compulsion in religion" [2:256]. So a woman cannot be forced to wear a headscarf just as a man cannot be forced to grow a beard, though the religion states that this is required. Secondly, the headscarf is a sign of modesty and piety for women. A Muslim woman wears a scarf and she is deemed oppressed, yet a Catholic nun can wear the exact same scarf and she is seen as a devoted woman of religion. There is obviously a clear contradiction here.
	As for the French government's claim that the headscarf is imposing on others then I would have to say that this is a completely idiotic suggestion. For one, the scarves usually worn by most Muslim girls are either just black or white in color and have no writings or other Islamic insignias on them. It's not like the scarves are neon green and say "Become Muslim like Me" on them. That would be imposing, but that is obviously not the case. Wearing the scarf is a personal choice by Muslim girls and it bears no impositions on others. 
Wearing the scarf is also not a violation of secularism in anyway. The whole point of secularism is to allow an individual to practice one's faith freely without any restrictions being imposed by the government. The claim that the headscarf is imposing on others is countered with a law that is now going to impose the views of the French government on the religious beliefs of its citizens. In attempting to separate church and state the French government has now just combined the two under its own control.

Headline: Interested in writing for the Beacon

Dear Ms. Cawley,

My name is Leif Elliott. I am a freshman at FIU and I am currently undecided as to what I want to major in but I am considering a double major in English and psychology. I am writing to you because I am interested in writing for the newspaper and I wanted to ask how I might go about doing that. I enjoy writing quite a bit and I am greatly interested in improving my writing skills and I believe writing for the paper would be an excellent opportunity for me to do so. Also if I decide to major in English I would like to possibly become a journalist or literary/film critic. In that respect I believe it would also be a great asset for me to start gaining experience. My biggest concern however is that if I join I will have too much on my plate and not be able to keep up with my classes. I don't have a job but I am taking 16 credits and I definitely want to maintain a high GPA. So I was wondering if you could point me in the direction as to what is required for me to join the newspaper (if it is still possible this semester), what exactly the job would entail, and perhaps an estimate of how much time I would need to devote to it to do well. I will certainly be committed to doing my best, but I just want to make sure I do not feel overhwelmed. If it is preferrable that I stop by your office in GC 210 I will most certainly do that-- I just decided writing a letter would be better first in case I could not find a time to meet with someone at the Beacon. My phone number is (305) 331-5507. Thank you very much for your assistance.

Leif
