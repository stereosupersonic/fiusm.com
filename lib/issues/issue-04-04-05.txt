Headline: Seeking Justice for Palestine
Subheadline:  
Author: os21@aol.com
&nbsp;
Justice is a word that we usually like to be associated with. To call someone "unjust" is most definitely an insult. Being unjust leads to being hated. It leads to revolt, retaliation, and violence. The United States has been unjust. Its policies between Israel and Palestine have not been just, they have been one sided for far too long. Its miserable and showy attempts at brokering peace between the to sides has been laughable and deplorable. Since I can remember as far back as when I was old enough to care "peace" between Israel and Palestine has been nothing but a mirage. It is a fantasy that my generation has grown up with because of politicians whose agendas and goals are not for peace, but for power and authority. 
	
     The U.S media has been nothing but a caterer to the Israeli government's propaganda. Assassinations by the Israeli government have become "targeted killings," the wanton destruction of towns and homes have become "military incursions," and the killing of innocent Palestinians are now just a collection of ghosts that are never even so much as mentioned on the air. For how many innocent Israelis who have died in this useless war, how many innocent Palestinians have been murdered by Israeli "military incursions?" The Israeli government blames Hamas for the killing of nearly 400 Israeli civilians since September 2000, but who will condemn Israel for its killing of 1,760 Palestinians, 263 of whom were under the age of 14, in that same time period? The U.S. government? The U.S. media? We already know the answer to that.

	We are made to believe that Israel's retaliations against the Palestinians is because of suicide bombings, that it is Israel who is responding to the violence being inflicted upon it and its people. The Palestinians are just a population of mass murderers and experts at making bombs. This has been the lie that has become truth by way of Israel's propaganda machine. The fact of the matter is that Israel has occupied Palestinian land for thirty-five years. For thirty-five years the Palestinian people have been fighting this illegal occupation of their land. The Palestinian people are not fighting the Israelis out of some sort of natural hatred, as the Israeli government would like it to seem. They are fighting because of injustice. 

     For the United States this is an opportunity to do something just. Instead of vetoing ever condemnation the United Nations passes against an Israeli atrocity committed against the Palestinians, of which there have been 64 such UN resolutions passed against Israel, the United States can start condemning what the rest of the world already knows. Once our government does this will we stop wondering why the people in the Middle East hate us so much.

Headline: Softball team drops three close contests
Author: Andres Cordero/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
March 31 - FAU 2, FIU 0

The Owls, who had already defeated FIU in the first four meetings of the season, did it again with a 2-0 win over the Golden Panthers. Sophomore pitcher Nicole Barrett was acknowledged with an NCAA plaque before the game, honoring her nation-leading eleven saves posted in her freshman year. Apparently, FAU Junior Candice Freel took the ceremony to heart. She responded with a complete game, three-hit shutout en route to her 10th straight win.

"They're a very good team with very good pitchers," Head coach Kim Gwydir said of FAU. "We're playing two outfielders who would not be normally starting but are there due to injury. Kristen Perry was an all-conference catcher last year and she's out in the outfield right now."

Kendra Laminack (10-9) pitched well for her club, allowing one run off four hits in just over four innings of work. But the lack of run support resulted in her ninth loss on the year. Jennifer Owens went 2 for 2 in the game and raised her batting avg. to .362, but her hits meant little with the lack of offense around her. 

"Jennifer's our best player this year," coach Gwydir said. 

Pam Mazzarella drove the first run in for the Owls with a double off Laminack that plated Jessica Sachs. FAU added to that lead in the sixth, when Jennifer Cavanaugh doubled off Barrett to score Marlene Lopez for the last run of the game.

The Golden Panthers will try to avoid a complete sweep by the Owls (35-12) when the two teams meet for the final time in a doubleheader Sunday in Boca Raton. 

March 26 - FAMU 6, FIU 5 (10 innings) FAMU 7, FIU 6 (8 innings)

FIU dropped two extra inning games in a doubleheader that took approximately six hours on March 26  in Tallahassee, FL. 

The same duo of Barrett and Laminack took the mound for FIU in game one, but the Rattler's Danielle Brown picked up the win, pitching eight innings out of the bullpen.

Laminack started the game and put in four innings of work in which she allowed one run. Barrett (2-6) picked up the loss, allowing five runs (two earned) and fanning eight batters in five innings out of the bullpen. FIU took the lead early, taking advantage of a shaky start by FAMU. Jacque Vetters walked to lead off the first and advanced to second when Jennifer Owens was hit by a pitch. Both runners advanced in the next at-bat off a passed ball, and Vetters scored on a Marleah Stapf groundout to third. 

Freshman Tabitha Embry, walked with one out in the fourth inning. She stole second with two outs, and scored on two wild pitches to give FIU a 2-0 lead. The Rattlers then cut the lead to one in the bottom of the inning on a sacrifice fly that scored Marie Reyes, but Stapf's second home run of the year gave FIU a two-run lead in the fifth. 

FAMU tied the game in the bottom of the sixth and a scoreless seventh sent the game into extra innings tied at three.

In the tenth, senior catcher Kristen Perry drove home Owens and Stapf on a double to left center field, giving the Golden Panthers a hopeful 5-3 lead. That hope turned into disappointment as FAMU answered with three runs off Barrett in the bottom of the tenth to win 7-6.

Game two offered little consolation as the same two teams played a second extra inning match-up for another one-run FAMU win. 

Amanda Nealer pitched a complete game for FIU and allowed three earned runs, striking out eight Lady Rattlers. The game went into the bottom of the eighth tied at six. With two outs and a runner at third, Nealer lost control on a wild pitch that allowed McMillan home and handed FAMU the 7-6 victory. Lack of run support was the biggest problem with the team early in the season, but with the bats coming alive in the second half of the season, Gwydir holds

her pitching and infield play accountable. 

"Our pitching's not as strong as earlier in the year, but they'll be fine."

We have to keep getting runs for them and making the plays on defense," Gwydir said.

Headline: Three I-A, four top 25 I-AA programs lined up for FIU in 2004
Author: Nikolay Orekhov/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The transition to I-A status is officially underway as the 2004 FIU football schedule was announced this week. After finishing 2-10 last season, the competition is slated to get tougher this year. 

The schedule includes three I-A programs and four I-AA opponents that finished among top-25 in the nation last year. 

The Golden Panthers will kick off their 2004 campaign on, Sept. 2 against Jacksonville. 

In a game that will be televised via satellite, FIU will take on an opponent that highlighted one of their victories a season ago.

Other home games include contests against No.7 Western Kentucky, a homecoming game against No.8 McNeese State, and No.24 Georgia Southern. 

FIU will also take on Louisiana-Lafayette, which will mark the first time the Golden Panthers compete against I-A opponent at home.

The task does not get any easier when the Panthers go on the road. 

The team first travels to Youngstown State and Stephen F. Austin. 

They then play at Louisiana-Monroe and at New Mexico State, both I-A programs. 

No.4 Florida Atlantic completes the road schedule in a cross-town matchup at Pro Player Stadium.

The third season of FIU Football will conclude at home, Nov. 27, with the team hosting Florida A&M.

Subheadline: Freshman Cody Jacobs and junior Jeff Skellenger are both new faces this year on the baseball roster and are both from opposite sides of the country, yet they know how to adapt to new surroundings on and off the field.
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
One was just a few counties north and the other a dozen states west, but FIU pitching coach Mark Calvi found both of them.

FIU starting catcher Cody Jacobs, who's from West Palm Beach, didn't have to seek out a college, because Calvi found Jacobs before he had the chance.

"FIU was very close to home, but coach Calvi had a lot to do with it," Jacobs said.

The same story applied to junior transfer Jeff Skellenger, who was spotted by Calvi all the way in Oregon, where he hit .307 with 22 RBI's as a senior at Mt. Hood High.

"I knew I wanted to come down when I met Coach Calvi," Skellenger said.

But it wasn't easy for both players to make the move down south to Miami, even though Jacobs is a "southern boy," although in a different sense.

Jacobs' family hails from South Carolina, and making the move to the big city was something Jacobs was semi-reluctant to do.

"I was really nervous when I first got here," Jacobs said. 

"I'm just a southern guy."

But the "southern guy," who developed his skills as a catcher at Santaluces High in Palm Beach, has had no trouble fitting in since his arrival at FIU. 

The freshman has already taken control as the team's primary starting catcher, hitting .303 with five homeruns and 22 RBI's - which is all a big surprise for one of FIU's youngest talents.

"I really didn't think I was gonna play at all," said the 6-foot, 195-pound Jacobs. "I wasn't expecting anything to happen this season. I thank God everyday."

Jacobs credits most of his success to his parents, who can be found in the stands almost every home game, but credits his father for getting him into baseball.

"My dad has been a huge influence," Jacobs said. "I played different sports when I was young, but my favorite was always baseball ... But my parents have been supportive of everything I do."

While Jacobs has the luxury of playing close to home where his parents can watch him play the same way they did in his Little League days, Skellenger has had to make the transition to Miami life alone.	 

Skellenger, infielder, admits he came down here not knowing what to expect.

"I came down here blind," Skelleger said with a chuckle.

Born and raised in Oregon, was anxious for an out-of-state college experience but never considered being in a different time zone, much less coming to Florida.  

"My dad was always my little league coach," said Skellenger, again laughing. 

"He was mad that he wouldn't be able to follow me to Florida to watch."

Skellenger excelled in basketball and football, but figured his future in baseball, the sport he played since age 5, was the brigtest. 

He has mostly contributed from the designated hitter position, but also plays first base for FIU.

"I prefer third base just because I have less experience at first," Skellenger said. "But I am just happy to play."

He is happier just to have an opportunity to play at FIU, a team he believes can achieve big things. 

The health science major always dreamed of owning a championship ring and fathomed that FIU would be his best chance.

"I came down here for a chance at Regionals," Skellenger said. 

Despite the team's slow start, the Golden Panthers have climbed above .500 for the first time this season, and Skellenger, who's bat has been hot lately, has a lot to do with it. 

He leads the team with a .389 average to go along with three homers and 14 RBI's.

"I got off to a slow start and I was real stressed out about it," Skellenger said. 

"But I knew I couldn't let my teammates down and I turned my game around ... I am having a good time here. My teammates took me in very well."

Added Jacobs: "All my teammates are great. We get along great."

But if it wasn't for Calvi's persistence in getting the duo to University Park, neither player would be at FIU right now. 

"I always wanted to go to Arizona State University," Skellenger said. 

"But after meeting coach Calvi, I knew I would have a good time down here."

Headline: Pot economics: why legalization makes sense
Author: Miguel Quintero/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Mary Jane must be liberated.

The time has come to legalize marijuana. When are Americans going to realize that in order to better the country's welfare, the freedom of choice must be respected?

Without choice, coercion is the only alternative. Without diversity, the pursuit of happiness is grossly limited.

Americans enjoy a strong economy, not because Allah, Zeus, or any other god has chosen America to have a strong economy; Americans enjoy a strong economy because she, herself, has chosen it to be so.

America's strong financial system is the result of competition in a free market - choice, diversity, preference, and alternatives. To limit competition would be to limit choice and to weaken America's welfare.

Americans enjoy competition, and that's one of the factors for a strong economy, but that's not the greatest factor. The greatest factor for a strong economy is incentives.

The greatest factor for America's strength is her inalienable rights. The freedom to choose and own property; the freedom to choose religion; the freedom to choose speech; the freedom to choose.

It's this freedom to chose that prompts incentive, but it seems as society grows, these incentives are slow to grow, and in some cases diminishing. There seems to be a fear: a fear of judgment. What certain Americans don't realize is that their fears are made worse  when restriction and coercion is implemented.

People don't want to be forced into doing what they don't like, and they don't want to be forced from doing something they do. That coercion diminishes incentive and that makes matters worse.

Perhaps most Americans fear that human beings are inherently bad, selfish, and immoral. Perhaps Americans should throw their arms in the air and say the world is coming to an end. 

Throw education out the window, and with it take deliberation and incentives, too.

Anybody who studies history knows that our society has come a long way and gotten better: morally and financially.  Why? Because of the direction and teachings of great men and woman:  Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert Kennedy, Sarah Weddington, Abe Lincoln and so many more. 

These individuals, and so many more, promoted and defended choice and diversity.

The use of marijuana is guaranteed by the Constitution as a "right to privacy." What a person does in their home and for themselves is their choice, a choice that ought not be denied.

But, this isn't the only reason marijuana should be legalized.

Most economists would say that marijuana should be dealt with on the demand curve instead of the present dilemma on the supply curve.

To say the least, if the supply of marijuana is attacked, the street price goes up (because of the lack of competition among vendors) and therefore street crimes go up. So, Americans are living in greater fear than they have to because they limit choice. Choice is a factor comprised on the demand curve.

Drugs are always going to find their way into the nation because there is a market for them. People want their product and they want their freedom.

"Give me liberty, or give me death:" the words of a great American hero.

The paradox lies in the reality that once people have their freedoms, their needs for certain products diminish because they look on to the best way to enjoy life.

America needs to promote and create existing and new incentives. In this, her economy will thrive in wealth.

Headline: Bush taxcuts worsen student debt
Author: Ted Randall/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
I remember my days as a full-time student at FIU. I had the good life. I went to the gym in the morning. I attended classes during the day. I did the work-study thing and hit the library a couple hours each evening. 

Few complications, lots of partying. Perhaps some of you are living the good life too. 

Or maybe it's a bit tougher. You have lots of student loans to worry about. You are working two jobs to make ends meet and going to class at night. 

Whatever your circumstances are, you have a vested interest in the 2004 election. The person who sits in the White House has a direct effect on you as a student, and President Bush has been hard on college students.  

His enormous tax cuts, 40 percent of which went to the top 1 percent of the nations' wealthiest, cut federal revenue which has, in turn, caused the federal government to cut funding to the states.  

It's a devious form of trickle down economics. States across America are suffering through the worst fiscal crisis in decades. States are crippled by $90 billion in budget deficits.   

Forced to make ends meet, states have had to make drastic budget cuts. Many cuts affect higher education.  

Florida, in order to make up for budget short falls, has had to make budget cuts and raise tuition at state universities.   

At FIU, for the 2003-2004 academic year, $4 million was cut from the Education and General recurring budget. Although the university expected 2,000 new students, the legislature did not fund enrollment growth, which would have provided $7.6 million. (FIU's anticipated enrollment was more than 35,000.)

The $4 million cut and denial of the $7.6 million effectively means an $11 million cut for 2003-2004, which comes on the heels of last year's $12 million cut.  

In order to better fund research and doctoral programs and pay professors and staff, the legislature approved an across-the-board tuition increase of 8.5 percent. However, the FIU Board of Trustees mandated that FIU raise tuition for the 2003-2004 academic year by approximately 15 percent for all students except in-state undergraduates. 

What does that mean to you, the student? If you can afford the higher costs and do not have to drop out, you face increased class sizes and cuts to counseling, tutoring, and remedial coursework.  

Fewer teacher's assistant openings, less research, fewer staff and faculty doing more work results in poor quality issues, bigger student loans, more hours working to make ends meet, and debt, debt, debt.    

In his 2000 election campaign, Bush promised to help "families prepare for the cost of higher education." He pledged that he wanted "to make sure that higher education [was] affordable and accessible to every American."  

Leave it to Bush to break yet another promise. I know politicians are notorious for doing so, but Bush takes the prize. Bush initiated a plan designed to tackle the $100 billion dollar federal budget shortfall by tapping $1.3 billion from the federal student loan program. Therefore there are fewer loans to give out.  

Then, this administration prevented students from being able to consolidate their education loans at federally subsidized fixed rates. You will be paying lots of interest on your loans.  

Bush has also attacked the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership. This program is designed to assist low-income students. In the program, the states establish need-based grants, and the fed matches those dollars. Last year, LEAP provided $171 million in low-income student grants. Bush has frozen this program, and in 2003 he reduced funding by as much as $67 million, which affected 1.2 million low income students. Bush also froze the Perkins loans and cut Pell grants.      

But wait.  

Mr. Bush's 2005 budget includes a $350 increase in the amount freshmen can borrow from the federal student loan program. However, the plan does nothing to raise the limit on these loans, which for more than a decade has been set at $23,000, at a time during which tuition has skyrocketed.  

Let's say the average freshman budget is $16,000 per year. The maximum student loan is $2,625, leaving a $13, 375 balance. This leaves students and parents scrounging to find money to make up the difference, often forced to go to private lenders and pay hefty fees and interest rates.  

You go to college to get a degree so you can get a decent paying job and satisfying career, but higher education has been marketed and deformed into a money making scam for lenders. Students end up in the hole before they even have jobs.  

Oh, and you better find one six months after you graduate because you have to begin paying back your loans.  

Here are some of Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry's proposals:

The College Opportunity Tax Credit provides an income tax credit each year of college on the first $4,000 paid in tuition - the typical tuition and fees at a public college or university. 

The Service for College Plan would offer students the chance to earn the 
equivalent of their state's four-year public college tuition in exchange for two years of public service. 

The State Tax Relief and Education Fund would help states struggling with budget deficits by establishing a $50 billion fund to stop education cuts and tuition increases across the country. 

I am not naive. Promises are promises not to be counted on until they become real. 

But with the way things are going we have to give someone else a chance to prove that they really care about everyday Americans and not just corporations and the grossly wealthy.

Headline: SGA Elections: The Beacon recommends
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
During every year's student government government election, The Beacon's editorial board interviews and makes their recommendations for the positions of SGA presidents, vice presidents, representatives at large, and lower divisions representatives. The decisions take into account a questionnaire the candidates are given and the candidate's performance at the interview. 



University Park



President and Vice President



The Beacon recommends:
David Medina and Marlene "Marly" Quincoces


This ticket showed itself to be the best choice because of their diversity in experience and political know-how of student government. While the candidates have less experience than some other tickets, Medina's several positions on finance committees within SGA explain the ticket's well-researched platform ideas and their emphasis on accountability and communication. Marlene Quincoces, although no SGA experience, has much campus experience mainly with community service events such as Relay For Life which she has coordinated for the past five years. Her strengths lie in her organizational skills and dedication to her work. 

In addition to lobbying to keep Bright Futures scholarships, their clear cut proposals for appropiating funds next year include expanding PantherCard usage to Publix and Wendy's, adding camera surveillance to all parking lots, garages, and housing and creating 20 new international student scholarships. They plan to fund these proposals with money regained by cutting the readership program and other programs which they consider to have been unsuccessful experiments. 

Overall, this ticket has realistic goals, a variety of  useful experience and candidates which have proven themselves to be committed to the students. 


Other Candidates:


Jorge Rosario and Malik Wilkes 


Totaling over five years of SGA experience between them, this ticket appears to be the most logical choice for the election. However, their platform lacks solidity by containing ideas which are either too vague, seem unrealistic, or are out of student government hands, and  are already currently underway. Some of their platform highlights are expanding online advising into other colleges besides business, opening up faculty parking to students at an earlier time than the current 7 p.m., and a pilot program to begin credit card use in one on-campus location. 


Jacqui Sosa and Larissa Lockett


Similar to the Medina and Quincoces ticket, Sosa and Lockett have equally diversified experience. The pair includes a seasoned in SGA representative and the vice president of the Student Organizations Council. Their platform, although filled with good intentions, lacks attainability. They resolve to better promote athletic events, increase laptop availibility at the library, and increase the number of class offerings during registration.


Representative At Large 
(three elected)


The Beacon recommends: 
Alex Prado


A sophomore majoring in business management, this candidate's experience does not stem from SGA. Still, he has served as a peer advisor, sat on the executive board of the Student Programming Council as well as the e-board of Delta Sigma Pi, a business fraternity. His top priorities include adding one to two weeks onto the current two week parking grace period, and moving the drop date for classes until after midterm exams. He also wants to open the Green library to 24 hours a day during finals week, and expand PantherCard usage to all vending machines.  


Other Candidates:


Kenny Alcé


Majoring in political science, this candidate is  personable and has extensive experience off campus and previously in high school where he was a Silver Knight finalist. However, his knowledge of SGA and his experience in that regard are lacking, especially for a position such as representative at large. 


Nancy Cadavid
	

A current representative at large, Cadavid's platform rests almost completely on her status as an incumbent. Her goals are vague, puzzling and lacking. She suggested moving the 24-hour study area from the Graham Center to the first floor of the library, and building a walkway in the Blue and Gold garage exits. 


Pedro Pozo


Without any SGA experience, and being a first year student at FIU, this candidate would seek to increase scholarship opportunities through community networking, place suggestion boxes on-campus, and encourage unity in the College of Arts and Sciences. 


Tarik Jallad and Jackie Ginarte did not submit questionnaires or schedule interviews. 


Lower Division 
Representative
(two elected)


The Beacon recommends:
The Beacon does not recommend any candidate.


Other Candidates:


Daniel Paul Diaz, Jorge Triay, Alfonso "Alfie" Leon, Mari Cabrera.


None of these candidates displayed the SGA knowledge to sucessfully fulfill their posisitions. In addition, their goals were not concrete, most being very general and open-ended. 


Ryan Little did not submit a questionnaire. 



Biscayne Bay



President:


The Beacon recommends:
Ruth-Allyson Webster (running unopposed)


Being the current vice president of SGA, this candidate's experience is self explanatory. Some of her major goals are increasing class offerings at BBC, improving the customer service on-campus, strengthing the relationship between SGA and FIU administrators, and striving to make the intercampus shuttle bus free of charge for students. 


Vice President
No one is running for this position. 


Representative At Large:
The Beacon recommends:
Micah Mintz (running unopposed)


This candidate has held two SGA positions in the past. After running unopposed last year as lower division representative, Mintz was elected representative at large in a special election halfway through the year. His plans include increasing student awareness and participation in student government and providing advising five days a week for students in the College of Business at BBC.


Lower Division Representative


The Beacon recommends:
The Beacon does not recommend any candidate.



Other Candidates:


Jason Geller (running unopposed) did not submit a questionnaire.

Headline: College Republicans support party
Author: Erika Taveras/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With a long-awaited year for local, state and national elections, FIU students are coming together in support of the Republican Party through the FIU College Republicans organization.  

The College Republicans have successfully held a number of events that illustrate the potential FIU students possess in having their voices heard in both the community and on campus.

"This is a chance for the youth (18-30 year olds) to be heard by exercising their right to vote, regardless of party," said Juan F. D'Arce Jr., chairperson of the FIU College Republicans. 

On March 27, the College Republicans co-hosted a breakfast at the Versailles restaurant to provide the Miami-Dade community with insights from the local Republican candidates running for county mayor, commissioner, state attorney and public defender. 

Each candidate briefly gave a speech on present and future endeavors if voted into office.  After the speeches, the candidates, members of the community, and FIUCR shared breakfast.

Another event that the organization was a part of was the 56th Annual Lincoln Day Dinner, which was held at the Radisson Mart Plaza Hotel on Friday March 19.

The Lincoln Day dinner is a major annual fundraising event             where the Republican Party promotes its elected local, state, and national candidates. 

This year's event was also geared toward kicking off the campaign for President Bush's re-election.

Some of the Republican leaders and candidates present included Gabriel Martin, candidate for public defender, Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, candidate for Miami-Dade county mayor, David Rivera, state representative, and Julio Robaina, state representative.  Evelio Medina, the past founding father of the FIU College Republicans, was also present at the event.

"The youth of FIU and South Florida can prove to make a difference if they use the proper approach when participating in the election process. It is my belief that the FIU College Republicans is the group to get the job done," said Madelin Ruiz, the Miami-Dade Coalition youth chair  for the George W. Bush re-election campaign. 

Ruiz, also an FIUCR member, plans on building a foundation that will last beyond her time at FIU.  

"One thing young people are famous for is not voting or caring about issues. My labor will be to inform young people about what is going on and activate their Republican spirit by voting for the Grand Old Party as they become involved in the politics that control our life," Ruiz said.

FIUCR has participated in FIU's Student Organization Council community events such as annual toy and food drives and American Heritage Day.  

The organization will also partake in this year's Dance Marathon.  

Future events will include cleaning the campus lake surroundings and a voter registration drive.

 "As chair, I am aiming at bringing the College Republicans to the community and erasing the stereotype that Republicans are unaware of the sufferings in the community.  Not only do I volunteer my time to the local community, as Chair I expect all of our members to become involved, as community service is key to political life and to personal development of leaders for the future," D'Arce said.

Subheadline: Find out who's running for representative at large
Author: Lisa Cawley / Editor In Chief
&nbsp;
University Park Representative at Large

Kenny Alcé, who is majoring in political science, wants to take his church and community leadership experience to the next level as University Park representative at large. 

The sophomore has served as a choir director, youth leader, and youth minister at his church, and he participated in student government in his high school. Alcé was a Silver Knight award finalist for community service, having founded football camps, marching bands, and other activities for local youth. Though Alcé has not had prior experience in student government at FIU, he does not see it as a disadvantage.

"You can see it as inexperience, I see it as freshness," Alcé said. 

Alcé said his fresh perspective and determination will encourage him to explore every possible avenue for accomplishing his goals. Those goals include expanding the forgiveness policy to cover four classes, fine-tuning the housing shuttle system, creating programs to unite UP and the Biscayne Bay Campus, and setting up a website where students can post their opinions and ideas about FIU.



Pedro Pozo, Sr., a recent transfer from Miami-Dade College, says with age comes wisdom and experience. 

The non-traditional student has served in the military, worked as a corrections officer, managed a limousine company, and just last year, he served as the governmental relations director in MDC's student government.

If elected, Pozo promises to create a unified atmosphere within the College of Arts and Sciences, create more scholarships, and improve locations of classroom assignments. He also wants to install suggestion boxes around the campus for students to voice their concerns.



Nancy Cadavid, currently a UP representative at large, is seeking re-election. 

Cadavid has served as the public relations chair for Delta Phi Epsilon, and she was a team captain for Relay for Life. The sophomore, who is majoring in international business, said her experience as part of the student government finance and student union committees has given her "the knowledge necessary to be the best candidate for this position."

If re-elected, Cadavid plans to provide more events for housing, sit on the finance committee, "take an active role in the decision making process of the attractions of [the Graham Center's] new expansion," and continue lobbying to save the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program.

In addition, Cadavid said, because opening GC 24 hours did not result in a high turnout, she is considering trying to get the first and second floor of the library open 24 hours a day instead.



Alex Prado said being a peer advisor is what has prepared him the most for the position he hopes to attain next: representative at large at the University Park campus.

The sophomore, who is majoring in business management, has been an executive board member of both the Student Programming Council and Delta Sigma Pi, a business fraternity. He has also been actively involved in Dance Marathon, serving as a morale captain. Prado said because he is a housing resident, he knows the needs and concerns of students who live on campus.

If elected, his top goals include lowering food prices in the Graham Center to that of comparable outside vendors, opening the library 24 hours a day during finals week, and expanding PantherCard accessibility to all vending machines. In addition, Prado wants to extend the grace period for parking from the first two weeks to three or four weeks. He also wants to move the final drop date to sometime after midterm exams.



Jackie Ginarte has been involved in student government for the past two years, and is now running for representative at large. Her goals include boosting support for FIU athletics, improving communication between students, faculty and administration, and uniting housing residents.


Tarik Jallad's platform includes a variety of issues. Jallad plans to increase scholarships, keep housing and tuition costs low, expand computer labs across campus, and make the housing shuttle more flexible. He also wants to keep essential areas of the library open 24 hours a day, "enhance student experience at all FIU athletic events," and facilitate the class selection process by improving faculty evaluations.

Biscayne Bay representative at large

Micah Mintz, currently  Biscayne Bay representative at large, is seeking re-election unopposed. 

Mintz has been a part of student government at BBC for more than a year. He started the year as a lower division representative and was elected representative at large in October's special elections. 

The junior, who is majoring in political science, said his platform this year is "more symbolic than issue[-oriented]." His major goals include making the BBC student government House of Representatives more effective and efficient. Mintz also wants to increase student awareness and participation in student government at BBC, and provide advising for students in the College of Business five days a week at BBC.

Headline: Amos shares wisdom, inspirational advice
Author: Bethany Scherbath/CONTRIBUTING WRITER
&nbsp;
Speaking at a lecture the evening of March 29 in the Graham Center Ballrooms, Wally Amos, the founder of the chocolate chip cookie company Famous Amos, encouraged the audience to take responsibility for their own decisions, learn something from every experience and, most importantly, to have fun.

This lecture began with a concert by the FIU Big Band, which set the mood for the evening.

Then Amos himself, founder of multiple baked goods companies, stepped up to the podium. Amos was wearing a watermelon hat, watermelon shoes, and a watermelon tie.

He admonished the audience for looking so serious and set two stuffed chocolate chip cookie characters on a chair next to the podium. 

The watermelon accessories, which also included a watermelon kazoo, were inspired by one of Amos' books, "Watermelon Magic: Seeds of Wisdom, Slices of Life."        

 The theme of the book, Amos said, came from the stereotype that blacks who eat watermelon are lazy and shiftless. Amos encouraged the members of the audience to make their own choices instead of allowing others to define them.

"The power of choice is the greatest thing going," he said. 

Throughout the lecture, Amos encouraged the members of the audience to live by several of his life principles, namely a positive attitude, teamwork, self-respect and love. According to Amos, "attitude is the magic word."

He sees that life is about turning lemons into lemonade, about making the most of the situation in which you find yourself instead of blaming others for your predicament.

Although teamwork is another principle Amos treasures, he does not value it as highly as the ability to trust one's instincts. He told the story of the very beginning of his cookie company, how he truly believes he wouldn't have made it if not for the help of others. He also admitted how his cookie company began to fall apart when he tried to do everything himself. Amos said Monday night, "I am more than I am but less than we are."

It is also important to respect oneself, he said. "If you don't hold yourself in high esteem, then how can you hold others in high esteem?"

Finally, Amos encouraged the members of the audience to work for love, not for money. As Amos said, if you do what you love, you will be happy and you can't help but be successful.

Headline: Comic-based thriller Hellboy a hellaciously good romp
Author: Steven Rea/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
"There are things that go bump in the night, and we are the ones who bump back," says Professor Trevor "Broom" Bruttenholm (John Hurt), the brain behind the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. It's a clandestine wing of the FBI operating out of Newark, N.J. (Nope, Scully and Mulder aren't anywhere to be seen.)

The good professor of "Hellboy" is also the surrogate father of Hellboy - a horned, tailed, crimson-hued hulk who was spawned in a 60-year-old experiment in black magic gone awry. Now an extremely grown-up grown up, the hulking Hellboy chomps cigars, gobbles Baby Ruths, and uses his demonic powers to battle the forces of evil.

Cracking wise while doing so? You betcha.

"Hellboy," with a prostheticized but recognizably wry Ron Perlman in the title role, is a jaunty yarn about giant tentacled monsters, nefarious Nazi scientists, mad monks (including the mad monk, Rasputin), and a dastardly plan to unleash "the seven gods of chaos" on an unsuspecting world. (Question: Isn't one god of chaos enough?)

Based on the Dark Horse comic-book series by writer-artist Mike Mignola, the film - despite being a half-hour too long - is a rocking, rolling supernatural spectacle. Armed, literally, with a hand the size of an anvil, Hellboy - his friends call him "Red" - stomps around in pursuit of nightmarish mutants and baddies who are messing with space-time portals and ancient relics of the Black Arts.

Aided by a telepathic fish-man named Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and in love with a mopey-eyed lass with pyrokinetic powers (played by mopey-eyed Selma Blair), Hellboy uses his innate talents to hunt down his diabolically disposed brethren.

In essence, "Hellboy" is a simple story with a simple moral: It's possible to do good things and be a good person even in a world rampant with villainy. And you'll be the better for the experience, even if you have to power-sand your horns down to stubby stumps.

Guillermo del Toro, the Mexican filmmaker with a bent for fantasy and horror (the vampire art-house hit "Cronos," the action sequel "Blade II"), orchestrates the thundering fisticuffs and "Alien"-esque special effects with aplomb. Like "Mimic," his laughably bad giant-cockroaches-plague-Manhattan movie, "Hellboy" features a couple of big sequences set in the city's subway system: runaway-train face-offs, third-rail fry-fests, screaming citizens running amok.

Super-powered conflict in the midst of everyday city life is, of course, a long-standing comic-book tradition. But such scenes also serve to extol the benefits of mass transit: Taking the subway not only cuts down on pollution, it's more exciting than getting stuck on I-95.

Normal-looking newcomer John Myers plays straight-arrow FBI agent Rupert Evans, functioning as the audience filter for the freak-show action going on around him, while Czech actor Karel Roden hams it up as Rasputin, Ladislav Beran struts around in a creepy mask, and Bridget Hodson veers into camp as the Aryan hottie Ilsa - a lethal lady in an SS uniform.

Faithful to its pulp roots and lacking the cumbersome self-seriousness of many a comic-book adaptation, "Hellboy" is, well, hellacious good fun.

Headline: Campus Invasion Tour tops SPC's Season Finale Blowout
Author: Krystal Alvarez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The MTV Campus Invasion Tour is making its sixth stop on its 17- date tour at the Golden Panther Arena at the University Park campus Wednesday. 

Hoobastank, Lostprophets and IMA Robot are the big acts performing at UP's largest concert of the year as part of the Student Programming Council's Season Finale Blowout. 

The concert is smack in the middle of the SPC's busy week, full of events to celebrate the end of school year. 

This particular concert was chosen because the bands are popular and generally liked, Concert Committee chair Emma Perez said. 

"I just recently got the position and we were stuck at the end of the semester without an act. The [MTV Campus Invasion Tour] was within our budget and is something all students can enjoy," Perez said. 

SPC is the largest funded organization on campus with a budget of $275,000 a year. Of that, the Concerts committee gets $55,000. 

The Campus Invasion Tour itself cost $25,000 but with venue expenses, and food and production cost the event costs approximately $46,000. 

Because the committee has spent part of it's budget on other concerts, the other SPC committees  gave $10,000; the Student Government Association gave $5,000 and the rest is going to come from ticket sales. 

The concert tickets are already available through Ticketmaster. They are priced at $7 with student ID in advance, $10 with student ID at the door and $15 for general admission.

 The bands from the tour are climbing the pop charts with their hit songs and are being recognized because of MTV's exposure. Hoobastank is known for its past hit singles "Running Away" and "Crawling in the Dark." Most recently, the band dominated the charts with its single "Out of Control" and has released a new song, "The Reason," off the album of the same title. 

IMA Robot is the most low-key act on the tour. The Los Angeles-based band is a wacky combination of new wave, punk and electronic. The band's video for "Dynomite," off their album Echoes, was on heavy rotation on the College Television Network but never made it mainstream. 

The Lostprophets are climbing the charts with the hit single "Last Train Home" off the album Start Something. The bands music is a combination of new wave, pop, metal and punk. 

According to lead singer Ian Wilkes, their musical inspirations are very eclectic and range from as pop as Duran Duran to as heavy as Slayer. The Lostprophets toured at the 2002 Ozzfest with The Used, Glassjaw, and Linkin Park, after their first album debut thefakesoundofprogress.

"Touring is awesome. You wake up in a different city, in a different country every day. There is sometimes no time to eat or to shower but in reality there is nothing really bad about touring. It is great," Wilkes said.

The MTV Campus Invasion Tour has had such past acts as Nickleback, Eve 6, Black Eyed Peas, Wyclef John, and Sum 41. 

Not only has the Campus Invasion Tour been a venue for the latest musical sensation, but it also comes with the Choose or Loose 2004 bus, whose purpose is to inform students of their presidential candidates and to promote voting for people in the age range of 18 to 30. 

 However, just because this is a huge concert does not mean some students don't have their reservations. 

"It is nice to see FIU finally receive some national attention because they are having such a huge event on campus. Unfortunately, this attention has gotten us Hoobastank," said Junior Ivan Blanco. 

This year, SPC  has also brought small acts like Rey Pirrin, Tony Touch, Dead Prez, Battle of the Bands for local talent and a chance for anyone to express themselves either through poetry or music at events called Coffeehouses. 

Frank Perez, the next concerts chair encourages students who don't like the acts FIU is bringing now to get involved in SPC and make a difference in the concerts that are held next year. Next year the concerts committee wishes to bring different types of music to UP.

"We are going to attempt to bring more commercial acts at a good price, and bring different genres of music that would keep the general student body entertained. Being involved is the best way to change what type of music students get exposed to next year," Frank Perez said. 

Among the other events SPC is holding this week are a comedy show on April 8, on April 9 there is a Renaissance Fair in the Library Breezeway, and "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" is showing at the Housing Quad as part of SPC Movie on the Lawn. 

All these events are run by students and are based on SPC members' own ideas. SPC the organization most directly linked to the student body and concerts like this one, tries to get students involved in the whole process of an event, according to SPC President Edward Ramcharran.

 "SPC is an organization which allows students to grow and mature. SPC gives students the opportunity to grow as a leader. It gives them a chance to contact agents, manage budgets, meet deadline and most importantly watch their own idea turn into a reality," Ramcharran said.

Headline: A. Marshall, former Dean of hotel school, linked to nazi cold-case murders
Subheadline:  
Author: usnswim@hotmail.com
&nbsp;
Former F.I.U. Dean of hotel school, Anthony Marshall, is alleged to be involved in nazi murders and cover-up

"Worse than Watergate" is the title of a soon-to-be-released book by John Dean, former counsel to the White House under Richard Nixon. Oh it's worse - alot worse, the mother of ALL scandals, still growing for all of the corporate scandals and neglible clean-up being done. See item 3 below for information regarding SOLVED and UNPROSECUTED homicides in Miami in the mid-70's. Such has been CONFIRMED by uniformed police officers. The following research is also DOCUMENTED and CONFIRMED.

1) BCCI - seized by the Federal Govt. - found to have it's largest outstanding note of $750 million to "Gokal Shipping" of Islamabad. And whaddyaknow? The Gokal family had a bunch of Days Inns out of it's "Hospitality Concepts" in Charlotte with Ramesh Gokal it's franchisee rep. before he was promoted to head-up Cendant's Knights Inns

2) Tollman and Hundley CONVICTED - they took Days Inn bankrupt. They purchased Days Inns FROM HENRY SILVERMAN for $725 million, financing $500 million of that on the junk bond market, defaulting on the entire $500 million 6 mos. later. Herny had his money by then. After bankruptcy, Silverman paid Stan Tollman and Monty Hundley each $375,000 for each of 5 years for "relocation consulting" ... then, he awarded them the $100 million stock option package in HFS, which became Cendant.

3) The murders for hitler in Miami - the "Hepatitis Murders" and "The Building Toss Murders" in Miami, 1970's.  The perps? Now the crimes are SOLVED!!! Here they are, the persons responsible for both sets of crimes - 40 dead victims - other than Tokars, who was convicted of crimes in the 90's, the other 4 remain free, at large, some wealthy, and laughing at getting away with murder for nazism:
 
a) John Snodgrass - Atlanta former CEO of Days Inn and pres. of Cendant now documented and CONFIRMED to have been among the 5 responsible. At large, not indicted!
b) Doug Collins - Atlanta - former pres. of Days Inn
c) Fred Tokars - U.S. Federal Prisoner #40099-066 - former Judge Pro Temp in Atlanta area.
d) Anthony Marshall - Orlando, director of the AHLA (*hotel industry assoc) and formerly Dean at FIU hotel school.
e) Tom Tobin - Atlanta - today, a magistrate, son of long-time Miami judge, David Tobin.

I believe that Miami Judge Jeffery Rosinek and Miami homicide Detective Ramesh Nyberg act and have acted to keep all of it covered up.  Among the victms include Helen Whited, daughter of the editor-in-chief of the Miami Herald, Charles Whited. I allege that Nyberg is the person responsible for the homicide of Gary Ghormley, former Coach at Gables football, and U.S. Navy Commander, murdered I allege, in Alameda, CA in March, 1986.

4) The nazi shrine at "the good ole Days Inn, Georgia" - insured by Jon Tisch at Loews/CNA. 

5) The proven, ajudicated, affirmed on appeal RICO relating to the homicide-for-hire of Sara Tokars, paid for by her husband, then Judge Pro Temp, Fred Tokars (*now U.S. Federal Prisoner #40099-066), which homicide was actually COMMITTED BY Days Inn security guard Eddie Lawrence.

6) The Lan-Chile Bae-146 that ran long off of the runway at Punta Arenas, Chile on a flight from Punta Arenas, Argentina killing 20 of the 50 pax. Among the victims was Dorothy Day, widow of Cecil Day, part of a party of 20 Days Inns executives. That accident in February, '91, was rumored to be related to the then on-going "Operation Desert Storm" - how? Well, the Bush family connections to financing of hitler and the nazis are now well-documented as are the matters of the nazi shrine at the flagship Days Inn in Atlanta's downtown. 

7) "The Turner Diaries", a fictional account of a nazi insurrection led by the protagonist of the story, an "Earl Turner". Ted Turner has been photographed in his nazi ss gestapo costume from MGM wardrobe and that photo was published world-wide.

8) The Miami murders - now documented and confirmed - Turner proclaimed on Miami TV, "I [Turner] will continue doing these ["The Hepatitis Murders"] until someone survives". Although he stopped, after my unlikely survival, they kept on going - 2 dead, 6 wounded at LAX West Imperial Terminal, July, 1978 at the arrival of the inaugural 727 service of MGM airlines from KLGA and KLAS.

9) Didn't stop there - no way - not for hitler and all that these nazis have to try to cover up. 6 U.S. Army personell dead of "induced liver failure" at Tripler AMC in Honolulu in the mid-80's.

10) 12 U.S. Navy swimmer candidates assaulted by knife in San Diego, mid-80's - different nazi cell, much closer to Tom Metzger's Fallbrook, CA home.

11) 17 assaulted, 5 of whom succumbed to their injuries in the "Clockwork Orange Murders" in Santa Monica, late 70's, early 80's. L.A. County Sherriffs ask citizen help for 3 verbal clues: 1) "Kirby" [I allege Kirby Wilbur - spoke at Republican Convention in '96] 2) "Beer" [I allege John Carlson - beer because of "Carlsborg Beer", popular in the timeframe] and 3) "a wise back or wise back-up" [I allege Peter Weissbach, national right-wing radio host].

Oh it's big and Cendant and Days Inn are right in the middle of all of it! 

I swear, under pains and penalties of perjury of the laws of the State of Washington that all statements contained herein are truthful and accurate.

Headline: Morning After Pill Free Until May 15, 2004
Subheadline:  
Author: athena@robynrosspr.com
&nbsp;
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CONTACT: Robyn Ross or
	 Athena Calderon-Scott
	 (305) 604-9197
	 athena@robynrosspr.com 

PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF GREATER MIAMI AND THE FLORIDA KEYS ANNOUNCES THE AVAILABILITY OF THE "MORNING AFTER PILL" FREE OF CHARGE UNTIL MAY 15
 
Miami, FL - (April 19, 2004) - Planned Parenthood of Greater Miami and the Florida Keys announced today that it would make the "morning after pill" available free of charge at its six area clinics through May 15, 2004.  President and CEO, Joan Sampieri, said that a donor's generous gift made the offer possible.  The donor wanted to make a symbolic gesture that would comment on the federal government's decision to postpone making emergency contraception available over the counter.   

"Emergency contraception is an FDA approved method of birth control that can prevent an unintended pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex," said Sampieri.  Allowing women to have better access to "the morning after pill" by making it available over the counter is an important step in preventing an unintended pregnancy."  
 	
Plan B®, the brand name of the pharmaceutical being considered for over-the-counter status, is taken in two doses and has been estimated to reduce the risk of pregnancy by 89 percent when used correctly.  In the first 24 hours after a single act of unprotected intercourse, Plan B can prevent 95 percent of expected pregnancies. Effectiveness declines as the time increases between intercourse and the start of treatment, so the sooner a woman has access to the drug, the better.

Sampieri adds, "it is our hope that making Plan B® available without charge to the community will increase the public's knowledge of this important form of contraception, encourage its wider use and help to fill the gap until such time as the FDA approves the drug for over-the-counter sales."

Plan B® has been available on a prescription-only basis since the Food and Drug Administration approved it in 1997.  It had been widely anticipated that the FDA would approve the drug for over-the-counter sales following overwhelming endorsement of the drug for over-the-counter sales by a scientific advisory panel, but in February it was announced that the FDA would delay its decision until the middle of May and it became apparent that approval of the drug for over-the-counter sales was in doubt.

To make an appointment for free Plan B in Miami-Dade or Monroe Counties, please call Planned Parenthood at 305-285-5535.  For information or appointments outside of the Miami-Dade area, please call 1-800-230-PLAN (7526) for a Planned Parenthood center nearest you.

Headline: Misuse of Financial Aid
Subheadline:  
Author: jarce004@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
F.I.U. students have long been accustomed to the incessant hassle that we are put through to take care of a few financial aid documents, transcript requests, holds on registration accounts, and other registrar issues. As a second year student, I am still appalled at the level of unprofessional behavior and condescending attitude that I encounter from employees on the first floor level of the Primara Casa Building, particularly in reference to misuse of my student loan.

 I received a Citi-Assist student loan for tuition purposes this past semester.  As stated in the contract with this lender, funds may only be used for tuition and fees for the given semester.  After these fees were paid, F.I.U. applied the balance of my funding to an accounts receivable balance, which had been under appeal.  The University ignored their contractual agreement with the lender, my contractual agreement with the lender, as well as state and federal law.  After a month and a half of unanswered phone calls and the run-around, I placed a call to the lender for assistance.  Citibank immediately filed a report of misuse of funds and advised me to file a report to the Department of Education.   On April 7, 2004, I filed a complaint against Florida International University to the Department of Education alleging that the school misplaced and misused my student loan funds.  
As students, we must remember that these loans must be paid back with interest.  We alone are in charge of how the money is disbursed within the terms of the contract we have with our lender.  The university is responsible to follow the law.  By misusing student loan funding, F.I.U. may well jeopardize our ability to obtain loans for our education.  This affects the entire student population.  I am not the first person that has had this happen to them at this university, but I do hope that my action makes me the last.

Attention C. Joel Marino:

    My name is Carlos Peña, I am a systems analyst and programmer for the Miami-Dade Police Department and an FIU graduate student pursuing my Masters degree in Computer Science. I am also a pledge brother of the FIJI fraternity colony and live in the FIJI house on campus. I just read the article in the Beacon which explained that non-freshmen students will have to make different living arrangements in the fall. As you may or may not be aware in the FIJI house we rent out rooms to male FIU students. Even if they are not FIJI-members they are welcome. In the house we have about half a dozen open spots. I would like to know if you would be interested in interviewing one of the fraternity representatives so you could do an article on what it is like to live in the FIJI house and overall to provide awareness to the displaced students of another housing option on campus, a housing option which much of the student body is unaware exists.
