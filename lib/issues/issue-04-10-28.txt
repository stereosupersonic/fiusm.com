&nbsp;
The women's golf team placed 17th at the annual Lady Paladin Invitational in Miami on Oct. 24. 

 Maria Hernandez led the way for FIU with a career best opening and final round 72, which was a career best finish of tied for 14th. 

Following an opening round 301, the Golden Panthers shot back-to-back rounds of 307 for a three-day total of 915 (301-307-307). 

FIU, went into the tournament ranked 140 but moved up to 120. The team finished ahead of higher ranked teams including No. 68 Miami and No. 93 Minnesota.

Coach David Pezzino was proud of the accomplishments his team achieved.

"Defeating Miami was important. There were many solid teams and thats the caliber of teams you want to beat," said Pezzino.

The freshman played a major role in the success of the team. 

Besides the career day of Hernandez, freshman Angela Ricaurte finished in 89th place in her first career tournament.

"She has a lot of talent and all she needed to do was get some competition under her belt," Pezzino said.

In her first year since coming from Colombia, Herenandez showed glimpse of a star by leading the young FIU team.

"Nothing seems to faze her," said Pezzino. "She has a great demeanor on the course."

The tournament concluded the fall season for the team.

Headline: Offensive mistakes cost FIU
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On a night that featured Method Man and Redman taking center stage at FIU Stadium, the Golden Panther's once again looked like two completely different teams separated by a fifteen-minute halftime.

As Golden Panther Head Coach Don Strock walked into the post-game press conference, the expression on his face looked devastated. FIU blew a big twenty-four point lead for the third week, and lost for the second week; this time to the visiting McNeese State Cowboys.

The big difference makers on this night were the time of possession and penalties that the Golden Panthers faced.The Golden Panther defense spent almost two-thirds of the first half on the field. Though dominant, forcing three turnovers, they became tired, spending almost another twenty minutes on the field in the second half.

With McNeese State pounding the ball on the ground the entire night picking up 300 yards and 510 overall, FIU was worn down. Late in the game when they needed the stops, missed tackles hurt the team. Safety Nick Turnbull said it best after the game.

"They just ran all over us," said Turnbull.

The Cowboys offense kept their counterparts off the field by converting 20 first downs in the second half and controlling the clock, including five third down conversions. The Golden Panther offense wasn't able to get onto the field for most of the remaining two quarters and when it did, it struggled.

Following a first half that saw them move the ball rather freely up and down the field, including going 3-3 in the red-zone, FIU never even got close in the final 30 minutes.

The team achieved just four first downs and one third-down conversion. The offensive squad was on the field for just over ten minutes in the second half until they were shut down completely, gaining less than 100 yards.

Penalties became a major concern for FIU in the final two quarters. After only committing one penalty in an almost effortless first half, the team, on both sides of the ball, fell apart, being penalized six times in the third and fourth quarters for over 60 yards.

Mental mistakes once again made the difference and cost FIU. Following a long kickoff return by Chandler Williams with FIU leading 27-14 in the third quarter, tight end Dannon Monroe was sent to the locker room for an early shower by the officials following a scuffle with opposing players.

The penalty yards that ensued following his expulsion gravely hurt the FIU offense. What would have been a first and ten start inside Cowboy territory, became first and ten inside the Golden Panther 30.

While the Cowboy defense stepped up the pressure, FIU was caught watching and never recovered. The momentum change that ensued sent the Golden Panthers flat on their backs to its third loss of the season.

&nbsp;
The  women's volleyball team kicked off the weekend on the right note on Oct. 22 at the Pharmed Arena with an exciting 3-2 victory over conference opponent Denver. 

The victory is the first home win for FIU since Sept. 11 and is also their second consecutive conference win.

Sophomore Oksana Zabalueva led the way for FIU with another outstanding 25-kill performance. Junior Laura Vogel added a double-double with a career-high 19 kills and 14 digs. 

Freshman Dyionna Smith helped out the offense with a career-high 65 assists, Junior Carolina Cano had 14 digs and Anna Dmowska added 11 kills of her own.

In the first game of the match, FIU scored the first point and took the lead on its way to a 30-25 win. Zabalueva and Dmowska led the FIU attack with eight and six kills, respectively. 

Denver came back to win the second game, 30-24, where FIU committed 11 errors compared to Denver's three.

Denver then won their second game in a row, 30-26, despite both teams committing 11 errors. Despite many early lead changes, Denver eventually took a 25-19 lead and only saw FIU come within two before finally putting it away. 

In game four, the match was knotted up 12 different times and featured seven lead changes. But when all was said and done, FIU came out victorious, 30-25. 

The fifth and decisive game was the most exciting one of all featuring another 12 tie scores and six total lead changes. The lady Golden Panthers faced match point with the score 14-13, crucial late errors eventually did Denver in as they lost 16-14.

"The team played cohesively," said Head Coach Cookie Stevens regarding the performance of the team. 

NMSU 3, FIU 0

The Golden Panthers headed into the match-up on Oct. 24 in hopes of feeding off the momentum of their win on Friday. 

But New Mexico State (20-2), the No. 1 ranked team in the Sun Belt Conference and defending conference champions, would not allow such a thing as the team swept FIU, 3-0. FIU's record drops to 3-17 (2-7 Sun Belt) for the season.

Oksana Zabalueva led the team in kills for the fifth consecutive match with 14, while Ruth Flemingled the team in digs.

In game one, FIU kept it close, but eventually lost 30-24 in the closest match of the game. Zabalueva led FIU with five kills. 

Game two featured 12 FIU errors compared to only two by NMSU. This cost the Golden Panthers as the team lost 30-19. Zabalueva led FIU with seven kills.

Game three began with 7-1 NMSU advantage. The Aggies never looked back and finished the match with a 30-22 victory. 

Junior Anna Dmowska led FIU for the game with three kills. For the match, FIU committed a total of 30 errors compared to just 11 by NMSU.

"I'm disappointed that we did not compete at a higher level," said Coach Cookie Stevens after the game. 

"We have to compete well in back to back games, play at a high level consistently and that will come with maturity," she later added.

That maturity must come soon seeing as how the Golden Panthers have five conference games left and need to win at least three to qualify for the Sun Belt Conference Tournament in New Orleans taking place from Nov. 18-20.

Headline: After win over SFA, blown leads have led to back to back losses
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers have played some of the best football in team history this season. Unfortunately, most of it has been limited to just the first half of games. 

For the second consecutive week, the Panthers allowed a multiple-score lead to disintegrate into a loss. 

For the sake of injecting some optimism into what's turned into a gloomy couple of weeks for FIU football, let's look back on the last happy moment we can all remember. 

Three weeks ago in Nacogdoches, Texas, against a tough Stephen F. Austin team, the Golden Panthers pulled out a road win for the second time in FIU's history. 

FIU exploded out of the gate and built itself a 31-10 lead by the third quarter. Then the offense fell into a coma and FIU allowed two fourth quarter touchdowns, just barely edging out the victory, 31-24.

Any time you win, especially on the road, there's cause for celebration. But while this is obviously a better team than that of the previous two seasons, some of the same old problems persist. Chief among those is the inability to play with a lead.

Two weeks ago the visiting Golden Panthers pounced to a 17-point, second quarter lead at Louisiana-Monroe. They appeared to be well on its way to being three-for-three on the road. 

Then, the team gave up 21 unanswered points, scored just one field goal in the third quarter and lost the game on a fumble recovered for a touchdown.

In the latest tale of two halves, FIU produced a 24-point lead at home against McNeese State this past Saturday.  While the cowboys are a good I-AA team (No.1 in the country for most of last year) they limped into this game as the walking wounded, losers of three straight blowouts. 

It's getting repetitive isn't it? The talent is there on both sides of the ball. The Golden Panthers would not build these leads if they didn't have the ability to both score points and keep opponents from scoring. That begs the question: Are they being out-coached?

In Saturday's loss, Rashod Smith, FIU's leading rusher, carried the ball just five times in the entire second half. 

That's while playing with a lead. Conservative offense is not FIU's game, and it shouldn't be. They didn't find themselves up 24-0 in the second quarter by being conservative. 

But the goal of the leading team toward the end of a game should always be to maintain possession of the ball while eating up the clock. 

FIU came out passing on virtually every possession in the fourth quarter. 

It's the responsibility of coaches and veteran players to keep the team's composure. There were four personal foul penalties called on FIU in a span of about two minutes during the second half of that game. That's 60 yards given up in twice as many seconds. 

The way FIU has performed in the first half of the previous three games; you get the sense that there will be opportunities to correct these second half mistakes. 

The last thing FIU needs is a lack of confidence late in close games. It doesn't take too many blown leads to knock a team into that here-we-go-again state of mind. 

We're still waiting for FIU's first dominant four quarter performance, but for now a close win will do at New Mexico State on Oct. 30.

Headline: FIU gets crushed in second half
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
McNeese State's John Marino sent a 48-yard field goal sailing through the uprights with 3:25 seconds left in regulation to snap the deadlock and complete a 30-27 come-from-behind victory over the Golden Panthers. 

For the second consecutive week the Golden Panthers blew a big, first half lead, this time giving up a 24-point second quarter advantage. FIU quarterback, Josh Padrick, was on target early, completing a 10-yard touchdown pass to Harold Leath, which put FIU ahead 7-0.

Safety Nick Turnbull made it a two touchdown lead when he jumped a route and intercepted Scott Pendarvis, taking it 25 yards for FIU's second defensive touchdown of the year. 

A 40-yard field goal by Adam Moss and second touchdown pass by Padrick, this time to Chandler Williams, gave FIU a 24-0 lead over the struggling Cowboys with just over ten minutes left in the first half.

A week ago the Golden Panthers found themselves up 17-0 at Louisiana-Monroe before a second-half collapse dealt the Golden Panthers their first road loss of the season. 

This week, back-up quarterback Chris Jones and tailback Chris Thomas led the Cowboys to their come-back win of their own, at the expense of FIU, a team that seems incapable of playing with big leads. 

Jones came on as a substitute for Pendarvis and completed 17-of-22 passes for 251 yards and a touchdown. He found Jason Miller in the end-zone just before halftime to draw one back and put the boys on the board, 24-7.

A school-record 52-yard field goal by Adam Moss opened the second half scoring, but it was all McNeese State from that point on. 

It took the Cowboys just four plays in 1:52 seconds to tally a second touchdown. Kris Bush found some wiggle room down the middle and ran it in five yards for the score.    

McNeese State's next scoring drive was even shorter. With two plays in 27 seconds the visitors were back in the game, 27-14. This time Chris Thomas ran it in from three yards out. Thomas finished with 172 yards on 31 carries. The Cowboys drew even at 27 on a five-yard end-around play by widereceiver Henry Smith.

"I thought we had run out of ways to lose, but we found another," Head Coach Don Strock said. "We made some plays on defense and then [McNeese] decided they weren't going to throw the ball, but they ran the ball down the field whenever they felt like it."

The Golden Panthers were outperformed in every statistical category. McNeese had 167 more rushing yards, 82 more passing yards and nearly twice the possession time as FIU. The Golden Panthers will travel to division I-A New Mexico State this week before returning for the homecoming game against I-AA Georgia Southern. 

Live broadcast of both games can be heard on WRGP 88.1 FM.

Subheadline: Poor attendance at Method Man/Redman concert makes football's future look dim.
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
FIU has found itself in a bind. With FAU's football team moving to Division I-A, the team needed to follow suit and join the Sun Belt Conference. The team was hopeful, as the requirement called for a 15,000 per-game attendance average, all the while knowing that with only 8,000 full-time students, even if every student was to attend to the game, FIU would still fall short of the prerequisite. Enter the Student Programming Council. 

In an attempt to draw in 30,000 people and raise their attendance average, SPC along with the athletics department booked Method Man and Redman to perform after the football game. The original concert, a co-headlining post-game rock out with the All American Rejects was heavily promoted all around UP, BBC  and Miami. However, due to Hurricane Frances, it was cancelled. Fast-forward to a month later, SPC scrambled to recreate the hype. It failed miserably. The game only drew a crowd of about 8,000 people and few stayed for the concert.

It is upsetting to think this is a foreshadowing of things to come. With so much hope, faith, and money put into the fledgling team, it's sad that excitement is dwindling, considering the semester is only half over. If two big name rappers can't pull in the required amount of fans, the team's attempt to draw in students and meet the Division I-A requirement on its own seems unlikely.

Headline: Most important election deserves full turnout from FIU student body
Author: John Colagrande Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
To vote or not to vote: that is the question. 
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
The slings and arrows of apathetic citizenship, 
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
And by opposing, end them? 
To vote: to choose. 

This election is the most important election of our lifetimes. For many of us it is our first presidential election. How cool is it to be a registered Florida voter? What a wonderful opportunity we have as Floridians-we will decide who becomes president of the United States. 

I used to live in California, in San Francisco. The city is the most socially active metropolis in the country.   

Everyone in San Francisco is involved in the political process. Everyone votes. But guess what? California votes aren't worth a dime. It's the same thing in New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, etc. 

Everyone is going to choose Kerry, so in essence, what's the point? The same thing goes for Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, etc. Bush will win those states-it's a given. 

We live in Florida! About 500 Florida votes decided the last election. Our votes count. Can the fact that we live in Florida be emphasized any more? Should the statement be made bigger and bolder? 

HELLO, WE LIVE IN FLORIDA. 

Our votes are going to determine this election. My vote, your vote, our friends', neighbors',  co-workers' and acquaintances' votes, all our votes are going to determine this election. We are in a position to make a difference. Not to get fired up about that is unimaginable.

This is also the first election where everyone has the opportunity to cast a vote before Election Day. Don't wait until Tuesday. Vote today, or tomorrow or the next day. It's as easy as pie. 

Go to the library. If you can't find your voter registration card, don't sweat it-as long as you have an ID, they'll let you vote. And if you can't find your ID, lay off the ganja, man. 

If you're not registered to vote, it is too late. You should feel like an idiot. And you should definitely keep your mouth shut because your opinion is of no value. 

If you don't know if you're registered, either call up the Supervisor of Elections and ask, or go to the library and try to vote anyway. 

Early voting is a great idea. Take advantage of it. You have no excuses.

If you've already voted, good job; however, your work is not done. Take it upon yourself to make sure other people have voted. 

Look through your phonebook. Call your friends and see if they've voted. Send a chain letter to everyone in your e-mail address book reminding them to vote. Text message your IM buddies. 

Call your family members. Harass that anti-social perverted uncle of yours, and tell him it would mean the world to you if he voted this year. Tell him you'll give him a hug. 

Make your disillusioned grandmother feel guilty. Tell her if she votes this year, it will make up for all the Christmas Days she gave you ugly shirts when you really wanted money. 

Talk to the students in your class. Talk to the people with whom you work. Ask anyone you're around. It's an easy question, four little words: did you vote yet?    

If they say no, ask them why not.  See if anyone needs a ride to the polls, maybe the dish-washer at your restaurant doesn't have a car or the time to take a bus. Offer him a ride. Offer to take his wife and both of their parents. 

It is our duty as Americans to cast our votes. This is how we contribute. This is how we are like soldiers. And, no matter how you look at it, be grateful that we can sit here in sunny Florida and vote and not have to patrol the Middle East looking for terrorists. 

Be grateful. Don't be apathetic. Vote.

Headline: Gay organization hosts film festival
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
Every summer, Miami  hosts the Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, a massive screening of movies dealing with issues relevant to the homosexual community. 

In venues spread  across the city, the internationally recognized festival draws crowds from across the country and world.

On a much smaller scale, gay and lesbian organizations at FIU have organized a mini-film festival of their own, screening three separate movies on consecutive Fridays, began Oct. 15 with the documentary "Mauvaise Conduit," or "Improper Conduct," a film about the oppression of homosexuals in Cuba under Fidel Castro's communist regime.

The idea came from the Stonewall Legal Alliance, a self-described "organization helping and supporting gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students and faculty within the College of Law."

The Alliance, which has been at FIU since 2002 - the same year the College of Law began - had always planned to hold an outreach reception for other gay and lesbian organizations, and for students and faculty. 

The idea of the film festival came later, thanks to Armando Abreau, an organization member.

The films, screened in the Green Library, served as a way for the legal alliance to interact with Delata Lamda Psi, the only gay fraternity on campus, and the Stonewall Pride Alliance, an undergraduate gay organization.

"The idea of having the movies is to let the FIU community know that we have a gay organization here on campus, a way of outreaching to the greater FIU population," said Frank Guzman of the College of Law's Legal Skills and Values program.

On the first day of the event, 30 people attended the reception, including the dean of the College of Law, Leonard Strickman.

"We had a lot of faculty support. Half of those who attended weren't gay," Guzman said.

The festival continued on Oct. 22 with the screening of "Before Stonewall," a documentary about homosexuality in America from the 1920's to the infamous Stonewall Inn riots of 1969. The last movie, "Kissing Jessica Stein," will be screened on Oct. 29.

Despite its small start, members are looking forward to the growth of the festival.

"We won't be competing against the big film festival," Guzman said. "It's nice to have this event on campus because it's convenient to the students, and it's about making a presence here at the university ... to let people know that we're gays and lesbians, and we're part of the community, both with faculty and students."

Headline: Rosa Jones discusses transfer to new VP position
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
In an interview with The Beacon, Dr. Rosa L. Jones, the newly appointed vice president of Student Affairs and Human Resources, discussed her new position and the growth of the university.

Jones, who declares that her years at FIU have been so many that she remembers working "in a windowless room in the [former Tamiami Airport] Tower," began assuming the responsibilities of her new post on Oct. 1. Her transfer will be complete in mid-November.

She is replacing Dr. Patricia Telles-Irvin, who left the post after being offered the same duties at the University of Florida.

Jones formerly occupied the position of vice president of Academic Affairs and Undergraduate Education, the department in charge of centralized testing, the Academy for the Art of Teaching, core requirements and other classroom sectors.

Q: What will your new duties be as Vice President of Student Affairs and Human Resources?

My title does not include Human Resources at this point; it is merely VP of Student Affairs and undergraduate education. The human resource component that Dr. Telles-Irvin had is not a part of the scope that I have at this point. But, I am truly excited about the new position. It gives me the opportunity to really work with a number of other areas that support the students and student life. There's a tremendous opportunity now to work with a great staff who cover a range of supports like campus life, campus activity, resident life, residential housing, the health facilities, counseling services, the office of disability services and a number of specialized programs that really are all aimed at helping students be more effective in terms of learning ... and help students round out the university experience.

When [students] come to college, most of them think, "What am I going to get in the sense of a degree?" But along that way there are experiences, opportunities to help students think about leadership and there are a lot of programs within Student Affairs focused on building leaders, such as Student Government. They develop their program [and] oversee their finances, all of which are experiences that don't take place in the classroom. [These things] give you the opportunity to apply what you are learning in the classroom in a real life way. To me, Student Affairs is really the other side of the coin, to help students expand their total person and apply it.

Q: What goals have you set for yourself? What plans or policies would you want to see enacted?

This is my second week, physically, that I'm transitioning, so I think my plans are evolving, but I can tell you that I'd like to see a lot more opportunities for Student Affairs and Academic Affairs to work together. For example, we're working with certain academic units to really emphasize leadership and create some leadership certificates  ... that will have given them some experience in their field.

I also want to see some greater opportunities for undergraduate students to be able to do research with faculty outside of the classroom.

I want to see us work to have more students see cerpossibilities of competing for some national fellowships, such as the [Harry] Truman or the [James] Madison, or having our students competing in national competitions.

Q: What do you think of the growth the university is experiencing in relation to the construction of new buildings in both campuses?

It's truly exciting to see the amount of growth we've had in both the size of the student population and the construction on campus. When I first got here in 1972, there was one building under construction and another one about to be there, so I've seen us go from having two buildings to the very large campus that we have [at UP], as well as the growth that we've had at Biscayne Bay Campus, because we did not have Biscayne Bay, and even our locations at Pines.

I think the buildings are a representation of the growth of our various academic units. We're moving to the point that, in order to be a very viable research institution, we must have labs, space for faculty and students and more classrooms.

Yes, there are negative consequences of growth, and some challenges [like] having enough space, growth and its relation to students and the problem with parking. 

Regarding this last problem, we're finding ourselves that we have to catch up because we were behind. I think the two new parking garages are giving us both additional issues and help. 

But the positive is that we are maturing and we have beautiful campuses. I think that there is a lot of progress that's been made here in 32 years.

Q: As part of this growth, there are currently plans for a new residence hall at the UP Residential Quad. Do you see FIU as experiencing a shift towards a more residential campus and away from our primarily commuter base?

Well, in terms of looking at a total number of residential students, I can say we have less than 3,000. We are currently projecting a new facility with 800 beds. Much of that has been because of growth in terms of students who are outside Dade or Broward County, or students who live in these counties but want more of a residential experience.

We will continue to grow in terms of traditional, but we will always have commuter students, and part of that is the nature of who we are as a public institution that always will have some relationship with transfer students from the community college.

What [students] will see as we grow in terms of being more research oriented is that we become more traditional in the sense that we are looking at some of the disciplines we have added to our degree programs. We believe strongly that having more opportunities within residential life will help students to graduate earlier. 

When you're a traditional student, you have more time to focus on a degree.

Headline: Senate candidates debate issues at FIU
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
As part of their "Campaign 2004: Battle for the U.S. Senate" series of debates, Republican senatorial candidate Mel Martinez and Democrat Betty Castor squared off on Oct. 25 in what was described as a "grudge match" held at FIU's University Park campus.

Already known to the crowd from TV advertisements criticizing each other's past, the candidates responded to questions on issues ranging from social security to gay marriage from CBS News anchor Russ Mitchell and a specially selected panel.

"I want to thank Floridians all over the state who are watching this debate, and I also want to thank [FIU] for hosting this debate, a university that is a great pride for this state and a home to many Hispanic students who share my heritage," said Martinez, as part of his introduction. 

The Cuban-born lawyer made various references to his past, describing his escape from his country during the 1962 missions of Operation Pedro Pan. He also referred to his struggles at age 15 to make a living in a new land and the help he received from foster parents that took him in upon his arrival in Florida.

Castor took the same initiative once it was her turn to speak, reminding the audience of the volunteer teaching positions she held in Africa as a young woman, her term as President of FSU in the late '90s and the large role she played in helping to pass the Healthy Kids insurance coverage.

"I've worked hard across party lines to help people, and these are the experiences I will take with me to the U.S. Senate," Castor said.

After the introductions, the candidates were asked to compare themselves to the Presidential candidate of their respective party and to cite any differences they might have with him.

Martinez went first, expressing his goal to protect Everglades funding no matter what environmental policies the Bush administration might have.

"When I disagree, I will not be hesitant to be an independent voice," he said.

Castor responded to the same question by stating an ambiguous disapproval of Kerry's stance on the death penalty and by disagreeing with the bipartisan education plan, No Child Left Behind. 

"It has formed a great bureaucracy that now threatens our children's education, she said."

Other questions focused on oil drilling on the Florida coast, the current political situation in Haiti and freedom of speech on college campuses.

When asked about the  Cuban embargo and travel restrictions to the communist nation, the two candidates responded at a more frenzied pitch, each accusing the other of an illogical stance. Castor stated that she favors more visits to the island by emigrated families and Martinez supports no visits at all until the fall of Fidel Castro.

Rare moments of agreement surfaced over issues surrounding gay marriage. Both candidates described the institution as a union between heterosexual couples. Both contenders also opposed gay couples adopting children and granting driving licenses to illegal immigrants.

Tension could eventually be felt, nevertheless, when panelist Tom Fiedler, executive editor for The Miami Herald, brought up that a supposed terrorist cell was discovered at FSU during Castor's term as the university's president.

Martinez derided Castor for this incident, stating that she let a whole terrorist agenda be perpetuated under the guise of freedom of speech.

"Here we go again," Castor responded. She pointed out that Martinez has constantly referred to this issue without mentioning that Sami al-Arian, the FSU professor charged with organizing the dormant terrorist cell, campaigned with Bush in 2000 and was actually invited to visit the White House.

"I'm the only person who took action ... I'm the only one who put Mr. al-Arian under administrative leave while this administration allowed him to enter the highest houses of politic," she said.

As the debate came to an end, the candidates sparred over the Iraqi war, each stating that the other had misunderstood their position.

They also discussed Social Security, the role of Israel in U.S. foreign policy and the mounting problems in Latin America, especially the communist regime of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.

Castor even pitched her support of stem cell research within the last seconds of her conclusion.

Despite the wide variety of issues discussed in this debate, some found it hard to pinpoint a single platform as the most important.

Eric Morris, an FIU graduate student in political science program and Castor supporter, attended the event and found several ideas important.

"All issues are important, but I think the minimum wage, the working class and Social Security are probably the most important issues. Although I don't think so much time should have been spent on Social Security," he said.

Matthew Troccoli, a senior and finance major, attended the post-debate rally held in support of Martinez in a Graham Center conference room and agreed with many of his candidate's views, especially those relating to the environment.

He mentioned the overall importance of the debate and the fact that it was held here at FIU.

"It brings legitimacy to the university. [It] brings us some attention and puts us in the league with other [universities] like UF," he said. 

The senatorial debate, sponsored by The Miami Herald, CBS 4 and FIU, was broadcast live across the state from the GC Ballrooms on CBS News and its affiliates.

Headline: Piano recital held in memory of deceased music professor
Author: Amanda Ramírez Castañeda / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The walls of the Wertheim Performing Arts Center at FIU's University Park campus echoed with the quiet sobs of audience members as they listened to students' piano performances during a recital held in honor of Dr. Miguel Salvador on Oct. 24. 

Salvador, a professor at FIU for fifteen years, died of lymphatic cancer Aug. 5. He was 47-years-old.  

"It was such a shock.  He was fine, and then, all of a sudden, he passed away," said Carl Lauderman, one of Salvador's students.  

An atmosphere of grief prevailed throughout the night as friends, family, students and colleagues of the late professor gathered to honor him. A large, black piano was placed under the dim stage lights as an image of the musician flashed onto a large screen.  

Over ten students played in the recital. Both Ramon Catalán and Daniel Escudero, students of Salvador, took a moment after playing their pieces to look at the image of their professor and salute him gratefully.  

"Thanks to professor Salvador, I obtained a full scholarship to attend FIU's School of Music. He opened the doors for me here at FIU," Escudero explained. "He was an incredible person. I felt very close to him and I identified with him greatly."

A slide show of Salvador's life, from childhood to his days at FIU, caused great commotion in the audience. Whimpers and sobs increased as the images passed. Many members of the audience embraced their neighbors in an attempt to console them. 

Although most were able to control their tears, one woman released a loud cry. The word "why" echoed in the room as she cried. It was obvious to all that Salvador was deeply loved by many.

"He was a very sweet person, considerate and patient. I was his student for three years, and he was simply the best piano teacher I ever had," Lauderman said. "He had a fatherly-type relationship with his students. His death was very hard on all of us."

Salvador's students planned and organized the event, which consisted of the hour and a half long piano recital and a small, intimate reception afterwards.

Lauderman, Escudero and Catalan were not the only ones to pay tribute to their professor. FIU professor Silvije Vidovic also played to honor his colleague.

At the end of the recital, students presented a photograph of the teacher to his brothers, Max and Enrique Eduardo Salvador, who in turn thanked FIU and the students for honoring Salvador's memory.

"I thought only Miguel could play that good but everyone here tonight played their hearts out," Enrique Eduardo Salvador said. 

Many remember Salvador not only as a wonderful person and teacher, but also as a great musician.

"He was a very talented pianist. His smooth, silky interpretations of Chopin thrilled everyone," Joseph Rohm, interim director of Music Theory at FIU, said.  

Salvador received his formal education at Indiana University, the Juilliard School and the University of Miami. According to Enrique Eduardo, Salvador always had a great talent and a passion for music.

During the recital, Rohm announced that the FIU School of Music would soon establish a Miguel Salvador Memorial Piano Scholarship. 

Rohm added that the professor's studio and piano will be dedicated to him and will forever be known as the Miguel Salvador Studio.  

"He was a wonderful colleague," Rohm said as he addressed the crowd. "These are only two of the many ways we at FIU will continue to honor Miguel Salvador's memory. We will never forget him."

Headline: The Faint returns with gratifying performance
Author: Diana Sempere / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On the night of Oct. 22, hundreds of eager music enthusiasts congregated at the Polish American Club at 1250 NW 22nd Ave. to listen to the explosive sounds of The Faint, with special guests, Beep Beep and TV on the Radio. Their musical beats thunderously pulsated in every corner of the P.A.C., as it's affectionately known. 

It's a common venue for a show presented by Poplife, an organization that promotes, in addition to concerts, a rare nightclub (held at I/O at 30 NE 14th St.) that caters to the new wave, electropop and indie music scene here in Miami. 

The show opened up with Beep Beep, a band from Omaha, Nebraska that shares a Saddle Creek Records bill with The Faint. Their set riled up the crowd with a cacophony of buzzing guitars and clashing drums. But they weren't the only reason why people came to the show. TV on the Radio, performed next. Their vocals were empowering and perfectly accompanied their melodic music.

But, it was The Faint's show and they delivered. By the time they got on stage, the P.A.C. was so packed that there was no elbow room. The audience anxiously awaited the performance and, as the stage was being set, began to chant, "Faint! Faint! Faint!" The band was having technical difficulties with their audio equipment, but it was worth the wait once they got everything up and running. 

The group's performance would not have been complete without the visuals. On a canvas, images changed with every note and it was as if one could see the music.

Their set was a balanced mix of their old material - mostly from their second to latest album, Danse Macabre - and their new album Wet from Birth, released in September.  Although Wet from Birth is not a dance album, like Danse Macabre, it still has the recognizable vocals of lead singer, Todd Baechle, and the same unique musical feel of every Faint album. 

When asked to comment on the difference between Danse Macabre and Wet from Birth, Baechle simply said, "We try to make every album different from the other, but we're always trying to get the same message across."  

They finished the night with the classics "Agenda Suicide" and "Call, Call." When the show was over, people poured out of the P.A.C. exhausted from jamming to the music, but still wanting more from a band that never fails to please.

Headline: Cafeteria food leaves patron disillusioned
Author: Carlos C. Olaechea / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"Ugh! The chickpeas taste like root beer!"  No, this isn't a line from a surrealist foreign film. It is simply the reaction of my dining partner to the garbanzo beans offered at the salad bar at the Fresh Food Company, FIU's famous - or infamous - dining hall. Instead of trying to bring readers a review of an exotic, inexpensive quality restaurant located in some obscure corner of Miami, I thought that it would be fitting to give a proper review of the "restaurant" most familiar to FIU.  

For those of you who have not had the luck - or misfortune - of dining at the Fresh Food Company, here's the 411:  it's basically an all-you-can-eat buffet for under seven dollars, but a little classier because you have attendants, much like the brunch buffet at an upscale chain hotel where there are servers behind counters to cut portions of roast beef, prepare "fresh" pasta dishes, and fix you a sandwich.  In other words, only half of this buffet is self-service like a true buffet is supposed to be. The other half - the Fresh Food Company servers - can't really be called servers, unless you consider service a few months of previous work experience at such gastronomic institutions as Wendy's, Pollo Tropical or Taco Bell, where knowledge of how long a salmon filet needs to be fried, or how long a panini needs to be pressed goes untaught, sufficient for your taste. But for a meal under seven dollars, you can't expect five-star service and should just accept their often comical attempts at providing diners with the façade of an elegant buffet.

Nevertheless, for that price you should expect quality food and a diverse selection, and this is where the Fresh Food Company often fails to satisfy, especially in diversity. It appears to me that the staff is trained only in the preparation of North American/Continental cuisine and, of course, Cuban cuisine.  

But, a student cannot live on two cuisines alone.  Therefore, the Fresh Food Company makes often pathetic attempts to provide diners with culturally diverse dishes. This leads to such atrocities as their so-called falafel, which is, in fact, just a fried ball of bread. An attempt at a ratatouille (a provençial dish of sautéed vegetables) carried with it an obscene amount of dried rosemary, a big no-no in sautees. (You should always use fresh herbs; dry herbs are reserved for roasts and slow-cooked foods).  

On Oktoberfest, their German potato salad contained mayonnaise, another major faux pas. Hummus, when available, has the texture of Hungry Jack mashed potatoes and contains chopped red pepper and parsley, no tahini (the sesame puree that gives hummus its characteristic smoothness and nuttiness), but plenty of garlic, giving you an idea that a Cuban "abuela" is behind the range putting her "toque criollo" into Mediterranean cuisine, and thus sabotaging it.  

Asian cuisine basically consists of the Fresh Food Company's normal fare doused with cheap soy sauce. Their panini, although sometimes creative, are often too dry and could be improved by adding some pesto or other sauce, or juicier vegetables such as tomatoes or roasted peppers.

When I first ate at the Fresh Food Company during my freshman orientation, I was excited to see an Island Cuisine section. "Great!" I thought, "They probably have jerk pork, curried goat, roti, sancocho, mofongo, and all that good stuff." Needless to say, I was disappointed to see mundane and mediocre picadillo and arroz congri. I was even more disappointed to see the same Cuban dishes repeated every time I returned to eat. Seriously, people, is it too hard to pick up a cookbook before venturing out into another cuisine or - as is the case with their island cuisine - refusing to?

Yet, why do people keep coming back if there are so many culinary errors being committed on a daily basis?

 "Ninety percent of the food usually tastes good and is edible," said Niel Fowler, a first year electrical engineering major.  There is reason in that statement, but note of the use of the word "edible." This hardly connotes excellent cuisine. 

Still, the hamburgers are usually satisfactory, as are the sandwiches and pizzas (except for their frightening toppings with which most of us are familiar). The Continental cuisine is often, as Noel stated, edible, such as roast beef and rotisserie chicken, and other North American fare.  

The salad bar has been good about providing diners with romaine lettuce and mixed greens recently, rather than just the "pauper of lettuces," iceberg lettuce (which they never mean to include in a retro way, since there is no blue cheese anywhere in sight). They could slice the cucumbers a little thinner, though, and cut the carrots a little smaller.  

The Fresh Food Company has also done a magnificent job - and this is where I take off my hat to them - on their dessert selection compared to last year when dessert options consisted of factory-made cookies, instant pudding, and sponge-like cake dyed in psychedelic colors. Options now include éclairs, flan, dulce de leche filled puff pastries, tartlets and other delectable confections. Of course, there is still the dependable soft-serve ice cream.

Because of their failure to provide tasty diverse menus, many students often resort to the tried and true: pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and more pizza.  

The healthier options are either unappealing or consist of such weird combinations that students do not want to look at them, much less eat them.  

Breakfasts are usually not heart-healthy and consist of eggs, bacon, sausage and an oatmeal that has the consistency of snot. As a result, the Freshman 15 becomes inevitable and directly contradicts the purpose of any university cafeteria: to provide students with healthy meals.  Fortunately, the Fresh Food Company provides us with a diet plan. It's called the "Being a Vegan/Vegetarian and Having a Meal Plan" diet. It works because you have so few food options that you go hungry and lose weight rather quickly. So I guess the freshman 15 can be avoided, after all.

My verdict: Although the Fresh Food Company provides students with cheap eats, there is a lot, and I mean a lot, of work to be done. I suggest the chefs open a cookbook once in a while and I urge students to complain. 

If there are no complaints, the administration will believe that everything is hunky-dory and they can proceed normaly, thus maintaining the status quo. I don't know about you, but bones in my Chinese chicken wrap and rancid-tasting ice cream are definitely not hunky-dory.
