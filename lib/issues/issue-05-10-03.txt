Headline: "Ska is Dead" tour proves otherwise
Author: Geoffrey Anderson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On Sept. 29, the "Ska is Dead" tour arrived at the Culture Room nightclub for its third consecutive appearance in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. 

The tour features both prominent and upcoming bands in the ska genre - a form of rock music that contains reggae elements and involves the use of brass instruments, such as the trumpet and trombone. 

The lineup consisted of popular ska bands, The Toasters and the Planet Smashers, as well as, local Florida bands, The Know How and the Supervillains. 

The Orlando-based Supervillains opened the show with their energetic mixture of punk and reggae. 

The Supervillains set list consisted of songs from their two full-length albums JAHmerica and Horseshoes and Hand Grenades. Although they only played a 25-minute set, The Supervillains had many people in the crowd dancing, or at least swaying back and forth. 

During The Supervillains's first song, a mosh pit almost immediately opened up in the middle of the crowd. 

However, this mosh pit did not involve a lot of pushing and shoving. 

Instead, people skipped and flailed their arms to the beat - a form of dancing known as "skanking" which originally came from Jamaica. 

After The Supervillains finished their set, The Know How from Gainesville graced the stage. 

The Know How's upbeat fusion of rock and reggae filled the venue with energy and intensity. The mosh pits increased in size and more people danced to the music.

Unfortunately, The Know How's set was plagued with sound problems. During the song "See Her Again," the Culture Room's PA sound system blew out and the band's vocals became almost inaudible. 

However, lead vocalist Skyler got the crowd involved and made everyone finish singing the song. 

Once the song finished, The Know How stopped playing for a few minutes as the sound system was being fixed.  

After five minutes elapsed with nothing being repaired, The Know How continued their set with a few more songs. 

With the sound system finally fixed, the band closed their set with the crowd favorite "Daniel Larusso is going to Fight!," and kids rushed to the front of the stage for the opportunity to grab the microphone and sing along.

Once The Know How left the stage, the crowd squeezed together to get a better view of the Planet Smashers. Hailing from Canada, the Planet Smashers produce a catchy blend of ska and pop that makes for an enjoyable live performance. 

The band opened with the song "Life of the Party" and the crowd responded enthusiastically. 

The band's stage presence was amazing - the horn players consistently moved to the front of the stage and motivated the crowd to keep its energy alive. Also, vocalist Matt Colyer cracked several jokes throughout the set to loosen up the crowd. 

At one point during the set, the group asked the entire audience to sit on the floor and jump up once the song reached its climax. 

The resulting chaos had several bodies knocked to the floor and people skanking around them.

The Planet Smashers finished their animated showing and left the stage to The Toasters, an established ska band from New York City. 

The Toasters played a lively 45-minute set that had practically everyone in the venue bouncing around to the roaring sounds of the band's horn section. 

The audience separated and opened up one giant hole in the center of the dance floor. 

With The Toasters filling the Culture Room with their intense energy, it was only a matter of seconds before the hole was full of kids flailing their arms and enjoying the music. 

The band concluded their set, but played a three-song encore because of the crowd's loud requests. 

The encore ended with several audience members dancing on stage and performing guest vocals. 

Members from the other bands also came on stage to celebrate the end of the show.

The entire show was a fun experience. 

The upbeat sounds of the music promoted a friendly atmosphere that resulted in a sense of unity within the crowd. 

People came together to support some of their favorite bands and to have a great time. Although this tour was labeled "Ska is Dead," the fun atmosphere and the big crowd at the show, made the statement very hard to believe.

Headline: Alumni celebrate eight year anniversary of comedy troupe
Author: Ashley Capo / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Before Nick Cannon's "Wild 'n Out," there was another sketch comedy improvisational troupe. With the witty comebacks of "Saturday Night Live," craziness of "MadTV" and classic audience participation antics of "Who's Line is it Anyway?," former FIU students celebrated their eight-year anniversary as a local comedy troupe, Impromedy.

Founded in 1997 by three FIU theatre students with a dream of being the greatest improv troupe Miami has ever seen, Impromedy has been "bringing urine into your pants" all over Miami, providing such memorable shows as  "The Phantom Fetish," "It Is The Year 2001 and Still No Flying Cars" and "Smack My Bishop." 

Starting out on our very own campus, the dynamic comedy group finally found a home at the Roxy Performing Arts Center, right across the street from FIU. In 2004, the troupe was awarded Best Sketch Troupe at the Improv Miami Prizes, an award well deserved and dear to them all.

Improv is the art of acting without a script. Almost everything done on stage is on-the-spot excitement and in-the-moment silliness. 

Mix up a couple of sketches, a little bit of video and enormous talent, and a fresh brew of comedy is made. These actors have been giving it to us for many years.

"Our whole show is catered to the FIU audience," said Kea McElfresh, a current member of the troupe and theatre teacher at North Miami Senior High McElfresh has been part of Impromedy for four years now. 

"Our target [audience] is in the 'seniors in high school, college student' range."

Many of the troupe's co-founders have succeeded in becoming teachers in their crafts in different schools across Miami-Dade County and have taught several workshops to young students interested in learning the art of improv. 

Johnny Trabanco, a comedian for seven years and current member of Impromedy, has been seen at the Miami Improv and considers himself to be "Miami's Man for Improv and Sketch Comedy." Some have even made appearances on screen. Co-founder Yamil Piedra, an FIU Sigma Phi Epsilon alumni and graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in theatre, has been successful in many films such as "The Punisher" and "Bad Boys 2," while having appeared in several television shows, such as "Boston Legal," "Las Vegas" and "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment."

Celebrating their eight-year anniversary with "The Golden Show," this group is obviously more of a family then anything else. Co-founder Ozzie Quintana, with a BFA in theatre performance from FIU, is in fact married to former cast member, Nicky Quintana, another theatre performance graduate, both of whom are currently theatre teachers for Southridge Senior High and South Miami Senior High Magnet Drama, respectively, and are expecting their second child earlier next year.

Peter Mir, a current member and student at FIU, said it best when asked why students should see the next Impromedy show, "Impromedy equals Fun," said Mir.

Maybe he didn't know what to say, or maybe it was so plainly obvious he decided to keep it short and sweet, regardless Impromedy is not a show to be missed. 

Their slogan may be slightly disturbing, but true none-the-less that urine will leave your nether regions and make for a great time. 

There are performances every Friday at 9 p.m. at Roxy Performing Arts Center. Admission is $10 for adults, but students have a reduced admission of $8.

Headline: Men's fall fashions run gamut: Preppy chic, hats and velvet
Author: Tiffany Dias / Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
Thanks to the popularity of television shows like "Queer Eye For the Straight Guy," not to mention more stores carrying fashionable men's styles, guys seem more willing to wear trendy clothes these days. 

No one said men like to shop, however. Knowing what to look for may help guys and the women who shop for them figure out what to choose. Here are five of fall's top fashion trends for men.
	

HATS OFF TO ACCESSORIES 

They're the season's hippest accessory, but think beyond the typical baseball variety. Newsboys, tweed caps, even wool bowlers are trendy, cheap and cover bed hair or bald spots. Accessories like leather cuffs, long scarves and messenger bags have also made a comeback, but only wear one accessory at a time to avoid looking overdone.
	

VELVET'S COMEBACK 

No, we're not talking the powder-blue versions of the '70s. The most versatile colors are black and brown; both are subtle and won't make the wearer feel like a lounge singer. 

A velvet sport coat polishes any outfit, even if it's thrown over a T-shirt and jeans. For dressier occasions, try a velvet coat instead of a tweed jacket.


STYLED TO A 'T' 

Paint-splattered, screen-printed and fitted styles are hot. They work with denim jeans, baggy trousers or even as way to dress down a suit. Look for them at men's departments or stores.
	

PREPSTER HIP

Leather driving loafers, cardigan sweaters, polo shirts and casual blazers are back in style. Cardigans and polos are casual; they can be worn at the office when paired with dark denim and slim-cut trousers. Stick to one preppy style at a time, like adding a skinny tie or vest to your look.
	

BERRY YOUR WARDROBE 

Burgundy and deep blue hues are staples for fall. 

Wearing a button-up shirt in one of these colors is an easy and inexpensive way to incorporate seasonal fashion into an existing wardrobe. 

Other colors to look for: chocolate, especially in leather, and black for trousers.

Headline: Going with the Flow
Subheadline: New Gables nightclub struggles to find success
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Walking around the residence halls or university parking lots, I sometimes find myself trudging through layers of castaway flyers. Though the flyers often advertise a variety of events (be it Greek rush week, student government occurrences or ludicrous job opportunities), the majority of the litter usually turns out to be glossy, colorful promotions for the latest, supposedly hottest  Miami nightclub.

It was among this avalanche of sharp-edged ads that I discovered a notice for the opening of one of these new hot spots, Flow Ultra Lounge, which opened Sept. 29 with the rather untactful announcement that this event marked, "The return of Blow Thursdays." Drug and sex jokes aside, this ad caught my attention because of another smaller announcement it placed near the heading: "Formerly known as Zba."

Similar headings can be found in many club flyers lying around FIU. "Now occupying the space held by ... "; "Replacing club ... "; "On the former lot of ... " and so on. 

Upon noticing these announcements, I began to reflect on the durability of clubs in Miami and why it is that the most promoted and hyped venues last only weeks or months before wooden boards go up on their building's doors and windows.

Would this latest club follow the foreclosure trend? Would it prove to be as "eclectic" as its ad promised? Simply put, would it last the night? Out of curiosity, I decided to stop by the opening night and investigate.

This new lounge is located in Coral Gables, a few blocks away from ritzy Miracle Mile. Though the entrance seemed a bit like the space formerly occupied by a storefront, the loud beats and glowing lights streaming from the windows made it evident from the start that this was strictly a dancing club.

I was quite impressed by the organization I found inside, tiny tables neatly placed around the central dance floor while comfortable booths faced the low-lit VIP room. Customers sitting in these areas could drink and talk with ease because the music, though encompassing the entire room, was smoothly leveled, the bass not pounding as hard as in most clubs.

The design of the place itself provided a very relaxing atmosphere, evidenced by the Moorish chandeliers that cast soft glows on the dance floor, a great effect when contrasted with the rapid strobe lights swirling around the room.

However, the strength of the club's neat, stylized demeanor was apparently not enough to win over the crowds because the place remained pretty empty for the majority of my visit.

One of the problems faced by Flow Ultra Lounge is the fact that its music, though nicely presented, is just too much like the tunes heard in the myriads of Miami night spots. The ad claimed that their sound system would present a mix of hip-hop, R&B, house, rock, indie and international, and though most of these genres were represented, it was only through highlights of overplayed hits like Kanye West's "Gold Digger" and Daddy Yankee's "Gasolina."

The style of the club itself may also prove to be a weakness. The club promised to attract a younger version of the nicely-dressed, fashionable Miami crowd that have made club hopping trendy, but nothing suggested as to how is being this particular lounge could stand out from all the others.

The club, which is 21 and over, could eliminate the sponsorship of less discriminatory, young party-goers, a crowd that has steadily been growing throughout the years.

Again, Flow may just be dealing with the initial struggles faced by clubs in a decadently competitive city, facing promotional problems while trying to come up with its own personality and style.

But because the club's founders seek only to attract a crowd known for its flippant, ever-changing nature, Flow Ultra Lounge may to be headed toward the early grave like many other Miami venues, and to have its space taken by another club advertising through glossy, paper-cut inducing flyers.

Hopefully, Flow will endure this rough patch and keep its early promises.

Headline: Career fair brings networking opportunities
Author: Yahnilet Colon / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Second-year law student Greg Saldamando was looking for help.

"Because, honestly, I don't know how to find an international-related job, hopefully these guys can tell me," Saldamando said.

Saldamando was referring to the International Law Career Fair and like Saldamando, many students at the fair were interested in the field of international law, but were unsure how to get their foot in the door.

Attorneys, students and law professors came together at the International Law Career Fair, Sept. 28. Professionals from the field of international law were there to speak about their experiences as attorneys and to give advice to students aspiring for a career in international law. 

The Office of Career Planning and Development, along with the College of Law's International and Comparative Programs Director, Jorge L. Esquirol, hosted the event, which was held in the University Park campus library, suite 220, at 12 p.m.

"The main purpose of the event is to expose our students to a range of international legal practice opportunities available in the local area," Esquirol said.

 Panel members included George R. Harper, Thomas J. Skola and Maria Cristina Cardenas - all are attorneys practicing international law in Miami and abroad. 

"Because the law school is based, [and instructs] law students on international law, I was very impressed that Professor Esquirol was able to put together such a great panel," said fourth-year law student Michelle Watson. 

With its large population of international students and its ties to the global community, FIU's law program includes a large curriculum of classes that focus on international law and its relation to the practice of law in the U.S. FIU's Miami location, as well as its course offerings, was something attorney and panel member Cardenas felt students should use to their advantage.

"We are lawyers in an exciting time in Miami," Cardenas said, citing the increase in South American business free trade, which often flows through Miami as well as the level of arbitration, or legal mediation, done in the city.

Traveling was also discussed as an important aspect for law students interested in the field - a factor many of the students had no problem with.

Second-year law student Jordan Dollar looks forward to traveling.

"Hopefully, [I'll] get to travel," he said, adding that what interests him about the international field is that it's, "not stuck on one subject ... it's very broad [and] developing fast."

Attorney and panel members, Skola and Harper, have both practiced international law for 35 years. Harper advised students to be prepared and seek the help and advice of experienced attorneys.

"Make sure that you are really good at what you do," Harper said to the students. "You're a young lawyer saying how do I do this, the way you got here and do your best." 

Skola encouraged students to travel abroad and work in countries of interest, which is what he did when he worked in Argentina during his first year out of law school, but to also look toward becoming a good U.S. lawyer first. 

Also brought up by the panel was the need for students to become familiar with their clients, the legal environment in different countries and the learning of different languages. 

"There are so many things you can do within international law," Cardenas said. "It's just a matter of finding your foothold."

Esquirol said the fair is part of a series of employment-related events held by the career planning and placement office.

 "This program is designed to expose our students to the types of law practice that involve foreign and international components," said Magalie D. Austin, assistant dean for career planning and placement.  "With this presentation, we hope to provide students with a practical understanding of the relevance of international and comparative studies and its impact on the practice of law."

Headline: ROTC training teaches leadership, commitment
Author: Nicole Acosta / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This year, the FIU ROTC program has begun implementing new ways to accomplish their goals.

"Our primary purpose is to teach leadership with the goal of sending young men and women into the army," said Leadership Officer Wally Gallart.

The cadets in the ROTC program have been busy with training since last summer. In June and July 17, senior cadets completed the Leadership Development Assessment Course. 

LDAC is a 33-day training exercise held at Ft. Lewis that includes rifle shooting, land navigation, squad and platoon tactics and first aid training.

"Training has been modified to prepare students for the changes that have been made in the army," said Lieutenant Colonel and Professor of Military Science Donald L. Barnett. Some of the recent changes were "future threats we expect," such as the war on terror and insurgents.

LDAC can determine whether or not students stay enrolled in the ROTC program.

"It gives them experiential training in both garrison and field environment," Barnett said.

During the LDAC, two cadets, Lazaro Oliva and Jonathan Ramirez, earned recondo badges by successfully completing it the first time around.

Also, senior cadets Carey McIntyre and Aaron Ramiro received all excellent ratings. 

Several students have completed other forms of training recently.

Cadets Ramirez, Oliva, Evelyn Velasquez, John Arteche and Andrew Bryant went to airborne school in Ft. Benning, GA. Cadet Eric Amstutz completed Mount Warfare School. 

One upcoming October event that the cadets will participate in is the Ranger Challenge. 

A 12-person team competes against all other challengers from the Sixth ROTC Brigade of Cadet Command. 

The field competition includes rifle shooting, obstacle courses and physical training tests.

"We basically had to build the team from scratch," Barnett said. "But now that some of them have experience, they'll break into the top 50 percent."

For the 2005-2006 school year, the program had the highest physical fitness test score average in the Sixth Brigade.

"That's great. Two years ago, they were dead last in the brigade," Barnett said.

In the spring, there will be an additional two-day field training exercise.

"That experience will help future cadets for LDAC," Barnett said.

The ROTC program has also been busy helping the relief effort for Hurricane Katrina. 

They had a personal food and supplies collection called Operation Blessing.

Barnett said that the program for ROTC is rigorous and not everyone who begins the program graduates.

"For about every three cadets that starts as a freshman or sophomore, one will get commissioned into the army," Barnett said.

Barnett, however, is hopeful about the cadets who have joined the program this year.

"They seem to be a strong and committed group of students," he said.

Cadet Clifton Antonio Francis is one such cadet. He had wanted to join FIU's ROTC program ever since he  joined the JROTC program his sophomore year in high school. 

Francis said  the ROTC program is "great" and the best part of it is "getting to meet new people and knowing that everyone keeps pushing and motivating me."

Francis has great ambitions for a future military career. He said he wants to get contracted into the army and become a military officer and join the corps of engineering.

As for graduating cadets, Barnett believes "they'll do excellent" in the army.

Squad Leader Waskar Juarez is not only getting contracted in a month, he served in Iraq as  Line Medic for the infantry from January 16, 2003 through April 20, 2004. 

Juarez said his most vivid memory of his service was "getting attacked by motors and having three casualties" and being the only medic on the scene. 

"We were scared. They landed out of nowhere. After, we wanted to find out who did it," Juarez said.

He also said that locals thanked him everyday for being in Iraq.

"People were grateful for us being there. They were grateful to have a tyrant and his sons out," he said.

Juarez says the ROTC is a "great program." 

"I got to meet a lot of people from different places. You build friendships and hopefully see them in active duty," he said.

After being contracted into the army, Juarez hopes to go back into combat arms and be in the infantry.

"I've been a follower. It's my turn to lead," he said.Barnett's expectations this year for the ROTC program are high.

"I expect us to commission about 20 cadets this year, which is a 20 percent increase over past classes. That is the measure of success for us, to commission students," he said.

The Reserve Officers' Training Corps teaches leadership. 

"[The Reserve Officers' Training Corps] includes time management, problem solving, conflict/resolution and we also teach military skills,"  Gallart said.

The traditional four -year program is comprised of two years of basic courses and two years of advanced courses, which commits you to join the army. 

An ROTC graduate with a bachelor's degree will serve as a second lieutenant army officer full time on active duty or part time while they start a civilian career.

 "Our mission is your mission - to get you through college," Gallart said.

Headline: James Bond seeks to improve university accounting records
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
His name is Bond.  James Bond.  But he's not a secret agent.  He's FIU's new university controller, the university's chief accountant.

"I'm just real excited about being here," Bond said.  "I'm so appreciative of what FIU has done to the community.  I'm glad that I can be part of that."  

Bond described the controller's position as having ultimate responsibility for the accounting records at FIU. 

"We keep the financial records of the university" Bond said. "All the transactions that happen as a result of any accounts payable, [for] example, where we have to pay a vendor for a certain service that they provide to the university." "There's various departments within the controller's department.  Accounts payable and student financials are some examples."

Bond first began working at FIU in January 2005, serving as assistant vice-president over financial operations.  

"They were doing a search for the controller at the time," Bond said.  "I spoke with Vivian Sanchez, the CFO, during my interviewing process and I tried to understand where my skills would best fit for the current needs of FIU."  

The search for a controller continued while Bond held his position. In March 2005, Bond was asked to assume the position of controller.  

"I really feel that this position offers me the ability to make a contribution," he said. "If I can help the students get a degree, or help the faculty better teach or whatever the case might be. It seems like it's such a lofty goal, that it keeps me inspired."  

His connection with FIU, however, goes back to long before he came here to work.

"I attended school here,"  Bond said. "I was very familiar with FIU, I've watched it grow. I actually came here as a child when it was only a two year university, when my father was attending the school.  More specifically, Marcos Perez, the vice president of administration, is a very good friend of mine. I asked him if there were any opportunities within the accounting field and one thing led to another."

Before he was employed by FIU, Bond previously worked in accounting for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Sunglass Hut and Deloitte Touche.  

"My background has always been accounting," he said.

Besides engaging in his daily responsibilities, Bond is also looking toward the future.

"There's certainly some things on the horizon," Bond said. "One of the goals that I have, as I have the student financials area under my jurisdiction,  is improving the current process of allowing students to make payments - specifically, putting in automation.  Instead of standing in line to submit a check, we can actually do an electronic check."

 "As it relates to PantherSoft, obviously, there's user groups, which are the faculty and the principle investigators on grants and various other departments. We need to make sure that the system they're using is being supported and being maximized in terms of its efficiency and what it can deliver." 

Bond said he doesn't mind sharing a name with a fictional super-spy, or being subjected to jokes about his name.  "It's actually a fun name.  [There are] certain names that I could have been given that would have been miserable to live with.  But James Bond is a name that is easily recognizable, but has a good image in a lot of people's minds and it actually is a good icebreaker."  

The name has its drawbacks also. 

"The downside to the name is not so much the jokes, but the fact that so many people remember my name, and I can't remember theirs.  Some of them come up to me and say, 'Hey, James Bond. How are you doing?' and I'm like, 'Who is this person?'"

Headline: Crew's speech encourages unity
Author: Ana Ribeiro/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Very few seats were empty in the Wolfe University Center Ballroom as guest speaker Rudy Crew took the stage on Sept. 27, at 4:30 p.m. An audience of almost 200 students, faculty members, FIU officials and visitors gave him a standing ovation and listened intently to his words. 

"Today my prayer is answered," Crew said at the podium. 

Crew, superintendent of Miami-Dade County Schools, revealed that one of his greatest desires has been to speak to the university community.  Another revelation came from FIU President Modesto A. Maidique. He said that he recommended that the county hire Crew in 2004 - fresh from Crew's gig as chancellor of the New York City school system. 

"I am thrilled that Dr. Crew is here," Maidique said to the audience before Crew's speech.

Besides showing his appreciation for Crew, Maidique called faculty 'the heart' of FIU and teaching 'the highest calling in life'. He also highlighted the graduation of FIU's first batch of law students with a 74 percent passing rate as a major accomplishment.

Crew's presence represented a much anticipated point of FIU's 25th Annual Faculty Convocation Week, which ran from Sept. 26-30. Events scheduled for the week also included banquets, a folk music concert, a faculty awards ceremony and the presence of the mayors of Sweetwater, North Miami and Homestead.	

Provost Mark B. Rosenberg said the week would allow faculty to both review their goals and get recognition for their excellence. He also introduced the theme of community involvement.

"We're not going to be all we can be unless we embrace our community," Rosenberg said. 

Crew's speech centered on the value of a relationship between the university community and the community at large. He said the university is the place where crucial conversations can originate, not only on the educational needs of children, but also on the healthcare and nutritional needs of their families. 

"There's no reason we should tolerate people having no home and no food," Crew said. 

According to Crew, in order to help advance this society, educators must understand its diversity, instead of spending time talking about racial divides. They must be able to cater to everyone, Crew said, from poor people, to immigrants, to brilliant-minded children who need special education. 

"As we attempt to move even faster forward, people are being left behind," he said.

Besides academic matters, children should be educated about the conditions out in the world and against violence, Crew said. 

"Or else," he said, "Either they self-destruct or they destroy you."

Crew also said there's "a picture to be built" of Miami, of a city with no more F-rated schools, homelessness or distraught senior citizens, a city strong and united in spite of differences.

"We've got to give people the opportunity of saying we're one Miami, one nation," Crew said. 

He said the community must thrive on and be proud of its past, while taking a good look at its future. Qualified potential leaders should be recognized and brought to the foreground of society, according to Crew. 

"We are what we ultimately do," he said.

After his speech, Crew answered questions from the audience and reiterated the notion that conversation is the source for stimulating social change. 

Journalism Professor Neil Reisner took his News Workshop class to the lecture, pointing out that it was an opportunity for his students to learn how to cover speeches and for him to hear what Crew - whom he described as "an interesting, smart, and thoughtful educator" - had to say.

"I thought his answers were heart-wrenching and important," Reisner said. "He put forth challenges to the university and its role in the community. But I wish he would've put it more strongly and urged the university to do something."  

Jilian Sanz, one of Reisner's students at the lecture, said she also appreciated Crew's message.

"I thought that he spoke eloquently and he had a genuine concern for the growth of community and university relations," she said. 

Another member of the audience was FIU alumna Paulette Smariga, who summed up in a few words the importance of the university in the community.

"The university gives us our sources of leaders and education that allow us to grow and achieve more opportunities," Smariga said.

Headline: Elderly care promoted at  FIU center
Author: Eddith Sevilla / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Researchers from the Center on Aging at FIU have been conducting studies on the long-term care, elder justice and health promotion of the elderly. 

Founded in 1984, the center is committed to developing knowledge and understanding of the elderly through investigative surveys, education and in-depth preparation. 

Over the years,  Max B. Rothman, executive director of the Center on Aging, has traveled to Guatemala, Saint Kitts, Saint Vincent and the Dominican Republic to administrate research projects concerning the elder. 

"I like working here because it's challenging and we learn a lot about the things one has to do health-wise, financial-wise and socially, in order to prepare for a healthy older age, as we try to contribute to the field of Gerontology" Dr. Rothman said.

Not only does the center conduct research in foreign countries, but much research is also done in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. 

Researchers contact elderly residents through several organizations, advocacy groups and memberships. They send surveys on particular topics through mail or participate in focus groups to learn more about the needs and wants of older adults. The results are then analyzed and researched. A report of their findings is then written and delivered to the sponsoring organization that reviews the explanation and searches for valuable information to act upon.

"We had a successful focus group on domestic violence against older women recently," said Louise Fiagaro, administrative support for the Center on Aging. 

Because women were able to speak, the research produced unique insight on how women view domestic conflict. The women concluded that verbal abuse is so damaging that they would prefer physical abuse.

 "We gathered interesting novel information no one's gotten before," said Burton D. Dunlop, director of research for the center. 

The National Institute of Justice awarded the center enough funds to run a two-year study on domestic violence against older women in 2002. Researchers obtained information from 21 focus groups that included 134 women who were Hispanic, black non-Hispanic and white non-Hispanic, and were within the range of 45 to 75. 

These women were asked to describe domestic violence, its causes, ways of reporting it and factors that prevent them from seeking help. 

"When we do these focus groups, we serve refreshments and interact with these people," Fiagaro, who has been working for the center since March 2002, said. "You won't believe how much abuse is going on."

One of the main focuses at the Center on Aging is Elder Justice - the participation of elders in the courts and the criminal justice system. 

This area deals with elders as victims, litigants and offenders. It also involves issues regarding domestic violence, neglect and exploitation of older adults. Researchers then investigate how the courts respond to these problems. 

"Elder Justice is on the cutting edge, and it's always fun to be on the cutting edge," Dunlop said.

Students are also getting involved in the program.

They may enroll in any graduate program in the university or apply for special status to work toward a certificate in Gerontology - the study of aging and the problems of the aged. 

"Graduate students enroll in just one or two courses as electives," said Professor Pamela Elfenbein, director of education and training. "I've had students from engineering and education, but the majority comes from nursing, occupational therapy and social work."

But, students aren't the only ones involved with the center, according to  Rothman.

"Any graduate student can get this certificate. Some professionals come back to school to get a certificate of Gerontology," Rothman said.

Headline: Faculty, staff read censored works
Subheadline: Banned books showcased at library
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
The list is long, containing titles one may never have expected to be seen side by side: the Harry Potter books; Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses"; the "Kama Sutra"; Kurt Vonnegut's "Slaughterhouse Five"; the Bible and Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn."    

The list is the American Librarian Association's registry of the most banned books in the world and it was displayed at the Biscayne Bay Campus' Library as part of the events for the Banned Books Week that took place on Sept. 28 and 29.

"Because we live in a country like the United States, where information is always so readily available, students may not know that there were times when books could be censored or banned, when a person was not allowed to read what they wanted to read," said Lauren Christos, a BBC reference librarian. "This event was set up to show students that the freedom they take for granted has not always been there and that there are still many instances of censorship taking place right now."

The event consisted of various readings by library staff and school faculty members of books or articles that may have been challenged or censored throughout in the past. Readers included Associated Dean of Arts and Sciences Joyce Peterson who read passages from Toni Morrison's "Beloved"; Eduardo Fojo, a librarian, who read excerpts from the popular Japanese graphic novel "Battle Royale"; and Peter Craumer, professor of international relations, who presented various articles dealing with the controversy over intelligent design.

"It's important that faculty members get involved with this event," said Ronn Silverstein, an English professor who takes his students to the readings every year. "When they read, they can add information about that book's history, reasons why it has been challenged and information about the author that can let students know why that particular book is important."

Silverstein also believes that informing students on the history of censorship will make them aware of the relevance of first amendment rights in today's society, an issue many take for granted.

"Students in this country aren't aware that books are still being banned or challenged. When they think of censorship, they picture 12th century book burnings or the Inquisition," he said.

Besides telling students about the history of book bans, Christos thinks they should know the various reasons why books are still challenged.

"The strongest reason books are usually challenged is because they may deal with topics of sexuality, like rape or homosexuality, which have always been sensitive issues. But religious and political reasons are always up there, as well as groups worried if books carry obscenities or not," she said.

The readings, which took place on the first floor of the library, were attended by over 60 students. However, no students participated in the actual readings, an occurrence that surprised Christos.

"We've had students read from books in the past, but we didn't get anyone to actually volunteer and show up this year," she said. "I hope students will take advantage of this event in the future and participate. Many just don't know that the books they have here at their fingertips aren't allowed to be read in many parts of the country. They have a freedom in the world of academia that cannot be found anywhere else, and they need to take advantage of that."

This is the fourth year the Banned Books Week (which is promoted around the country by the ALA) is observed at FIU.

The University Park campus bookstore also held a display of challenged books in their store front.

Headline: Gas Prices
Subheadline: President Bush not to blame for increase in petroleum necessity
Author: Christopher Necuze / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Hurricane Rita took aim at the second largest state in the union, people nation-wide feared the damages that this hurricane could do, not just to the Texas coast and its population, but also to the pocketbooks of everyday Americans.  

Besides being Houston's home, the fourth most densely inhabited city in the country, the Texas coastline is also the location of the largest concentration of oil refineries in the country.

After Hurricane Katrina decimated the Louisiana coastline, many Americans found themselves waiting in ridiculously long lines to pay an even more outrageous price for a gallon of gasoline.  

Not surprisingly, people immediately blamed these despicable prices on, who else, President George Bush.  

Some people honestly believe that our president wakes up every morning scheming new ways he could inconvenience the American people. 

 So with a wave of his magic presidential wand, he increased gas prices to unprecedented levels.  

Jokes aside, the recent increases in oil prices can be attributed to many things, the least of which is President Bush - he does have some say, but his power is not nearly as much as one might think.

When it targeted the Louisiana Gulf Coast, Hurricane Katrina ripped through a critical infrastructure essential to US oil refinement. In her wake, Katrina left the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest in the country, out of service.  

Along with the port, three major pipelines, which deliver refined products from refineries along the gulf to nationwide locales, were shut down. 

 It is estimated that 95 percent of the region's oil producing capabilities were debilitated, which accounts for about eight to ten percent of the nation's entire oil production capability.  

These factors just might have had a negative effect on gas prices (note sarcasm.)

Before Hurricane Katrina, U.S. oil refineries were running at 97 percent capacity - barely keeping up with the nation's growing demand for fuel. The two major hurricanes in the past few weeks have drastically reduced that number. 

 If any good came from these storms, it is that they have drawn attention to the deficiency in refining capacity which was there even before the hurricanes struck.  

Should anyone really be surprised that gas prices are as high as they are? With record demands and an increasingly short supply, prices are going up. This is nobody's fault; it is simple supply and demand economics - the hurricanes just made an already bad situation worse.  

To be fair, one must acknowledge the growing disparity between the prices of one barrel of oil and one gallon of gas.  

Don Nichols, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, published a report in which he reckons that in order for the price of a gallon to reach $3, the price of a barrel would have to be near $100.  

Lately, the price of a barrel has remained stable at about $65. So where is this extra money going?  The extra cash is probably going into the pockets of oil companies, who are taking advantage of the huge demand.

There are many ideas proposed to remedy the countries energy woes: from alternative energy sources, like hydrogen-powered vehicles, to drilling for oil in Alaska. Some of these proposals make sense, some don't.  

First of all, America needs to expand its refining capacity in order to be able to process more crude oil.  It is not that there is a lack of crude, as some have suggested; it's just that it has nowhere to go.  Secondly, and most importantly, is something that we can all do right now- conserve.

Basically, if Americans stopped demanding so much oil, oil companies would be forced into lowering their prices.  The gas situation in this country is more complicated than it seems. The president really has hardly any control over it, and most of the recent increases in prices are because of uncontrollable circumstances - like hurricanes. 

 As much fun as driving around in  your oversized SUVs, and blaming our president for everything that is wrong with your life, neither of them are going to actually help lower gas prices. 

 Instead of pointing fingers, put away the gas card, hang the keys to the Hummer 2 - start conserving - and then gas prices will start to fall.

Headline: Tax cuts hurting us, not helping
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Want evidence that our republican-led national government has completely run amok?  President George Bush recently said, in a nationally televised speech, that the federal government will spend whatever it takes to rebuild the Gulf Coast, all while pledging to cut federal spending and refusing to raise any new revenues. 

 Meanwhile, former House Majority Leader Tom Delay claimed before his indictement "there is no fat left to cut in the federal budget." When you have two ideologically extreme conservatives disagreeing over fiscal policy, you know trouble is rearing its ugly head nearby.  

 Can Americans afford both Iraq and Katrina? Yes, but not how our misguided president wants to.  

We cannot afford $1.4 trillion in tax cuts. If Congress refused to make permanent just one of Bush's tax cuts - the repeal of the estate tax- it would generate close to $290 billion over the next decade.  

That, by itself, more than pays for the $200 billion estimated it will cost to rebuild the Gulf Coast. The estate tax only effects the inheritance passed on to descendants of those in the top two percent of the income ladder.  Apparently, republicans feel it's more important to make sure they keep their two percent rather than using the revenue to rebuild lives and provide hope for the millions transplanted by Katrina.

One of the few things Bush admits to is being an avid history reader.  However, it appears U.S. history hasn't been covered as of yet. During WWII, Franklin D. Roosevelt cut non-war spending by more than 20 percent and raised taxes to finance war costs. During the Korean War, President Harry Truman cut non-defense spending 28 percent and raised taxes to pay for the conflict.  Only during Vietnam did American leadership dodge difficult choices, with the results being high interest rates, deficits and low growth.

Acknowledging that Bush plans to pay the full $200 billion, the question becomes how will we actually pay for it?  Easy, we'll borrow it. Just like we'll do for the additional tax cuts.  

Borrowing is how we've afforded the tax cuts and Iraq at the same time. Needless to say, the Bush administration surely will neglect to point out that the interest resulting from the borrowing runs the deficits - already at record highs - up by additional billions each year.

Now that Americans digested these tax cuts, borrowing and a $200 billion price tag, let's address just what the government's priorities are. While Bush insists he feels the plight of the poor, he supports cutting social programs like Medicaid and food stamps by $35 billion over 5 years.  

The Republican-controlled Congress fully supports these slashes and pledges to make Bush's tax cuts permanent, which brings in thousands for our nation's wealthiest two percent and pittance for the middle and working class.  Compassionate conservatism surely reigns in Washington!

Finally, with Congress already having approved $62 billion in relief spending, Americans are dying to know where that money is going. With the Bush administration having been investigated and publicly bashed for awarding no-bid contracts for Iraq reconstruction, they wouldn't do that again would they? Did they learn their lesson?

 Apparently not. FEMA, the highly criticized agency, has granted a few no-bidders already. The Shaw Group, a client of former Bush FEMA head Joe Allbaugh, was given $200 million. Bechtel, who has been granted $3 billion in Iraq contracts, has made more than $100 million in Gulf Coast effort.  

The Fluor Group, a major GOP donor, was awarded $100 million.  CH2M Hill, which has $41 million in Iraq contracts, is being given $100 million for its work in Alabama. The Halliburton firm and Allbaugh client KBR has $16 million on the way for levee fixes.     

 All the politics behind Katrina has overshadowed the real victims in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. Unfortunately, this administration has the reputation of using national emergencies to advance its own agenda (9/11 and the Patriot Act).  

Once again, the administration is throwing money at its base and its donors, at the expense of the victims and leaving our generation to foot the bill.  Until someone stands up and demands that republicans stop using this country as its own personal, limitless credit card, they have proved they will continue to do so.  Are you listening, Democrats?

Subheadline: Conserving gasoline is important, an advantage for all
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In the past couple of weeks, the United States has changed dramatically. Across the nation, people are crying out over the same terrible cause - gas prices. Gone are the days we could pay $2.30 per gallon of gas, so what are we to do about it? President George Bush says we should "conserve more gasoline due to the crisis in Louisiana" because of Hurricane Katrina and that "things will slowly get better," but in reality, having high gas prices is good for the economy, especially in a society where the deficit is immense. Prices will stay high for as long as they need to, which is a huge problem in a city like Miami, with no worthy form of public transportation. 

What are some things you can do to avoid filling up the gas tank as often? Pass up on taking that extra trip to the beach this weekend or carpool with friends if you find that you absolutely need to go somewhere. 

This new rise in gas prices not only comes at a socially crippling time, but also at the beginning of a new school term. FIU, being a commuter school, suffers greatly from the new cost of fuel. While the parking situation was bad last year, it seems that this year is far worse, especially since the acceptance of the largest incoming freshman class to date. The lack of garage space combined with the large number of student body means that on any given day students wait up to 20 minutes  - wasting gas - for a decent parking space. What can be done to reduce the excess use of gas while on campus? For one, you could carpool, which would not only help with the gas situation, but also parking. You could also park farther and walk to your class. While this may not help the parking situation, at least you wouldn't be wasting time and gas looking for a space.

Students that need to go to the Biscayne Bay Campus, using the shuttle bus is a must. The increase in passengers has increased this year, often times increasing the buses from two to three at peak hours. Spending $3 on a round trip is far better than spending close to $8 on gas and tolls. if you take the turnpike.

Everyone must conserve fuel. Not only is burning fuel bad for the wallet, it's bad for parking and the environment.

Headline: Senior forward leads young Golden Panthers
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Awards and accolades continue piling up for men's soccer forward Carron Williams. FIU's top newcomer in 2003 and Offensive MVP last season, Williams was named Conference USA and soccerFLA.com Player of the Week for the week of Sept. 19.  

Williams was recognized because he scored FIU's first hat trick in three years on Sept. 16 against Alabama A & M and added the game-winning goal against Xavier two days later. A NAIA national champion as a freshman at the University of Mobile in Alabama, Williams has since led FIU to two consecutive NCAA tournaments.

Now a senior, Carron Williams is looking for bigger and better things in FIU's first season as a member of Conference USA. The senior spoke with The Beacon shortly before he left with the team to California for a road trip. He disscussed his athletic background in Trinidad, his collegiate success and his thoughts on the future of Golden Panther soccer.

Q: Freshman Judah Hernandez said that he couldn't help playing soccer in Trinidad because the people there eat, sleep and breath it. How true is that?

Oh yeah, we play soccer all the time. When I was in high school, I ran track too so it was track and soccer, track and soccer, track and soccer.

Q: What are your fondest memories of competing with the Youth National Soccer and Track & Field teams in Trinidad?

When I was on the Youth-Under 17 team - when I played Barbados in Barbados - I scored on a shot that was practically half-line.  

On the track team, when I went to the Pan-American Games in Puerto Rico, we placed second to Jamaica. We should have won but ...

Q: How often did you travel with that team?

A lot. It was a strain on my school work. I'm from Tobago and I had to fly down to Trinidad because most of the team were Trinidadians. So I had to fly from Tobago, back and forth. What we had to do was my family had to move to Trinidad.  Now I live in Santa Cruz, Trinidad. It was easier because it was a strain on my work.

Q: How special was your 2002 NAIA national championship season?

It was special. I haven't won anything that big in the U.S. It was an awesome feeling.

Q: How competitive was the tournament?

It was close. Guys were taking shots in the groin and everything. We fought tooth and nail and we won. It was a good feeling. I had an assist in the final game, on the game-winning goal. I gave the assist to James Gledhill and he scored the deciding goal.  

Q: What led to your arrival at FIU?

I didn't have the grades to come to FIU [in 2002]. Coach [Karl Kremser] knew the coach from Mobile so he put a word in and I went to Mobile for one year and then I transferred here.

Q: What's the biggest difference between Mobile and Miami?

The school is much smaller in Mobile. There were a lot of woods and trees, insects, bugs, and animals. It was a good experience in Mobile, but it was quiet. It wasn't like back home where there were a lot of friends and we'd go out and stuff. In Mobile, it was just soccer, school, and sleep. Miami is fun; there's more Caribbean people.

Q: What do you consider your crowning moment at FIU thus far?

The three goals I scored; the hat trick. No, no, let me tell you! The game against Hartwick [on Nov. 12, 2004]. That was a good game too. I scored two goals and we won the game and the conference.  

Q: What could top that during the remainder of this season?

Scoring the game-winning goal against a top-ranked team.  

Q: Last year, you guys outshot UCF 14-3 in the first round of the NCAA tournament, but lost.  How difficult was it to recover from that defeat?

It was disappointing. I thought we should have at least beat those guys. It was a soft goal. That's how it goes sometimes.

Q: You're listed at 5'8", 180 pounds. It's obvious on the field that you're really strong and fast. What's a typical Carron Williams workout?

I don't know. People say I'm big, but I look at myself and I don't think I'm that big. But since I've been growing up, I've been active, playing soccer and track. 

I don't really like to lift weights, but I do a lot of situps and pushups on my own. When I'm watching TV, I do situps or pushups.

Q: Going back to your hat trick against Alabama A&M, you scored with a header and both of your feet. What's your favorite way to score a goal?

With my feet because I got crushed on that header. It was between two guys and I got hit on the back of my head.  

Q: In the following game against Xavier, you scored another goal, but missed on six other shots. Is that a good game for you?

That game was frustrating because I had a lot of chances and  threw a lot of chances away. If we lost, it would have been a bad game. But since we won, I guess not. I should have put away those chances.

Q: The team has 17 newcomers, but has still gotten off to a fast start. How have you guys done it?

Everybody's played soccer. Soccer is not hard. It's easy to gel with a player. If you play soccer, it's a universal sport. It's easy to gel and we gel well.

Q: FIU was ranked seventh of 10 teams in the preseason Conference USA poll, despite winning four of the last five Atlantic Soccer Conference titles. Was that an accurate prediction?

Well, we have a good group of guys. We'll find out, don't worry. We'll find out. Let's wait and see.

Q: Can this young team, in its first year in Conference USA, win the conference this season?

Yeah, we have a good group of guys. We lost a lot of defenders, but we've got a good group of defenders now. I think we should give them hell.

Q: The team has a nice following of  soccer fans. But, obviously, wouldn't it be nicer if the stadium was full? 

Yeah, we need to get stuff out and advertise the games a little more. The girl's team had a good following against University of Miami, so I hope we can get that kind of support for a guy's game.

Q: If you could say one thing to students, to encourage them to come watch the men's soccer team play, what would it be?

We are one of the most successful teams on the FIU campus. We need those guys' support to come out and help us this season because we're looking to go all the way. So I hope guys can come out and cheer us on.

Headline: Men's basketball team releases 2005-06 season schedule
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's basketball team, a team that advanced into the Sun Belt Conference semifinals under first-year coach Sergio Rouco last season, announced its 2005-06 schedule on Sept. 29. 

The Golden Panthers will face nine teams that reached the NCAA tournament last year in a season in which they hope to improve on last year's mark. 

The most notable opponent for Rouco's men is Michigan State, a team that reached the NCAA Final Four last season.

"We have two key athletes coming back in, Ivan Almonte and Ismael N'Diaye, and with the addition of several new players this season, we believe we can compete against this caliber of opponent besides bringing the university some national exposure," Rouco said. "I expect us to be a better team than we were a year ago and while our record may not indicate that because of the high quality of this schedule, our goal is to challenge in the Sun Belt."

The men's team will also travel to the nation's capital to face George Washington  Dec. 8, a game in which they  look to get revenge for a loss last season. The team will also travel to South Bend, Indiana to face a Big East power house, Notre Dame, as well as Midwest schools LaSalle and DePaul, all during the month of December. 

FIU will open its schedule on the road against a team that made the NIT tournament last season. Hoftra, which beat the Golden Panthers last year, will host the rematch Nov. 19.

FIU will start its 13-game home schedule Nov. 22 against Central Connecticut State, a team they beat on the road last year. 

The Golden Panthers will close out the month playing at Florida A&M Nov. 25 and hosting South Florida Nov. 29.

FIU will start the Sun Belt Conference schedule against Arkansas-Little Rock  Jan. 5, and host Arkansas State two days later. FIU will also host two- time defending SBC champion Louisiana-Lafayette Jan. 21, and last year's east division opponents, as well as NIT participant Western Kentucky  Jan. 31. 

This year's Aéropsotle Sun Belt Conference Championship will be held in Murfeesboro, Tenn. The winner will receive an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament.

Headline: Men's basketball lands transfer; former Jayhawk
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Even though Alex Galindo will not step on the court this season, his addition will be valuable to coach Sergio Rouco's side in the coming future. 

Galindo, a 6'7" guard/forward, transferred to FIU Sept. 26, from the University of Kansas. 

The sophomore averaged 4.3 points and 1.7 rebounds per game last year for the Jayhawks and was considered one of their biggest threats from outside. He was rated the 65th best high school player in the country by rivals.com coming out of St. Benedict's High in Newark, NJ. 

Galindo chose FIU over schools such as Pittsburgh, Rutgers and Miami in order to join coach Rouco, who discovered Galindo in Puerto Rico. 

Because of NCAA regulations, any player who transfers must sit out a season, thus, making him eligible for the 2006-07 campaign. 

"Alex is a high-level player who was highly recruited and can carry our program to new heights," Rouco said. 

Galindo's presence could really benefit the Golden Panthers, a team that struggled from distance last year and really lacked a dependable shooter.

Headline: Despite mediocrity, Padres clinch playoff spot
Subheadline: Commentary
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The final out was recorded and almost immediately, the team poured out of the dug-out and onto the mound for the celebratory man pile.

It had the look and the feel of a team that had just won the World Series. 

But, in reality, it was a mediocre team winning a division title and a spot into the post-season.

In fact, when the San Diego Padres clinched the National League West Division that night (Sept. 28), the victory brought their record to 79-79.

The possibility of a .500 team winning a World Series has baseball purists everywhere preparing to hang themselves.

When Major League Baseball began division alignment in 1969, the purists went nuts. They argued that there could be a possibility in which teams in one division are weaker than another. 

Back then, there were two divisions for each league - NL East, NL West, AL East and AL West - so there was a good chance that the second or third place team in the West was stronger than the first place team in the East and, therefore, deserved to be in the postseason.

The 1973 New York Mets team is a prime example. The team finished the season 83-78, which was good enough to win the NL East and earn a spot in the NL Championship Series. 

However, the second and third place teams in the West that season had better records and were, arguably, better teams. The Dodgers (95-66) and the San Francisco Giants (88-74) were denied a post season opportunity.

Surprisingly enough, the Mets advanced to the World Series where they ultimately lost to the Oakland Athletics. But we will never know how the Dodgers or the Giants would have faired if they would have been involved.

Now, the 2005 Padres are in a similar predicament. Only this time, there is a possibility that they could enter the playoffs with a losing record. 

The sad thing is, if the Padres were in any other division, they would have been out of the division race a long time ago and they would have lost a shot at the Wild Card a couple of weeks ago.

The only reason MLB hasn't done anything about this is because division alignment makes sense for the teams. The alignments are done regionally so as to reduce team travel, which in turn reduces costs.

And now that there is a Wild Card and a third division (Central), four teams can make the playoffs, making for a longer postseason and more revenue for the playoff teams and MLB as a whole.

MLB can do the smart thing and keep the divisions, but only for team travel convenience. Then, the four best teams of each league advance to the playoffs.

However, that wouldn't be in the best interest of MLB. If we were to take the four best teams from the NL this year, that would eliminate the entire NL West. 

That means that there will be a serious lack of interest in the NLCS from fans in the West Coast. Low ratings equal low revenue.

In the end, it's not about putting deserving teams in the playoffs. It's about money. And that's always the case with professional sports.
