Headline: Third straight conference title

&nbsp;
Fans packed the stands of the FIU Soccer Stadium on Nov. 12 for the Golden Panthers home season finale.

In an attempt  to reclaim the conference title for the third consecutive year, FIU had to defeat tough opponent No. 14 ranked Hartwick College. 

The Golden Panthers  came  out ready to play and practically won the match in the first period when the team piled up three goals during an eight-minute stretch. FIU finished the game defeating Hartwick 3-1.

"We were all over the place in all facets of the game. Offensively we were creating things. Defensively, as a team we were giving them nothing," said head coach Karl Kremser after the game.

With the win, the Golden Panthers won the conference title for the third consecutive season and improved to 11-5 and 5-0 in the ASC play; the Hawks dropped to (13-3-3) overall and (4-1-0) in the conference.

FIU jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the 19th minute of the match when Carron Williams received a great pass from Oscar Gil, dribbled past defenders and scored his first of two goals on the night. 

Then, just over two minutes later, the same tandem found the net once more at the 20:41 mark. Williams took a pass inside the box and kicked it past the goalkeeper. 

The two goals by Williams gave him eight for the year and put him atop his team in goals scored.

The Golden Panthers sealed the victory with Bobby Boswell's third goal in as many games, which came on a monster header off of a corner kick from Jared Rose in the 26th minute. 

The Hawks barely avoided a fourth straight shutout on FIU's behalf, as they scored their lone goal of the game during the 60th minute. 

Adam Mitchinson recorded his fourth goal of the season to snap the Golden Panthers' shutout streak, when he connected on a header that resulted from a free kick at the top of the box. 

Golden Panther goalkeeper Shawn Crowe finished with three saves.

"I'm very pleased that we won, very pleased that we're going into the tournament, but we need to work on finishing and playing a complete game, rather than just one half," Kremser said.

Next for FIU, the team will travel to South Carolina, who they have never defeated in the previous five meetings. 

The Golden Panthers will return home and watch the NCAA soccer tournament selection show on ESPNEWS.

Between 4 and 5 p.m. on Nov. 15 at Gracie's Grill, fans will be welcome to join the team to celebreate with player and coaches.

Headline: FIU loses fourth straight
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The triple-option attack of Georgia Southern exposed the FIU run defense, rushing 74 times for 440 yards en route to a 53-32 trouncing of the Golden Panthers in FIU Stadium. 

The Eagles (9-2) spoiled FIU's homecoming celebration, handing FIU a fourth consecutive loss as the home team drops to 2-5 on the year.

"It feels like we've been here before," said head coach Don Strock after the game.

The Golden Panthers second-half woes continue to plague a team that's averaging just over 28 points per game, while allowing opponents an average of nearly 36. 

FIU gave up a half time lead for the third time in four games, this time spoiling a 25-17 advantage at the midpoint.

Led by quarterback Chaz Williams, Georgia Southern's offense gained 535 total yards on 89 plays, totaling for five touchdowns on the ground and one on the air.

"That offense may be the toughest in America to defend," said Strock. "I doubt we'll see an offense like that again."

Running the unorthodox triple-option, Williams managed to complete just 4 of 10 passes for 95 yards through the air but had a hand in four Georgia Southern touchdowns, running three in himself and throwing for a fourth. 

The Eagles  added a defensive score on a Josh Padrick interception taken back 70 yards by linebacker A. J. Bryant.

Georgia Southern's 53 points is the second most allowed by FIU this season behind the 56 put forth by New Mexico State on October 30. That adds up to 109 points allowed in the last two games.

"We knew they were going to score points," Strock said. "We knew we had to score points. Obviously, we came up short."

Rashod Smith and Josh Padrick put up good numbers for the Golden Panthers. Smith gained 139 yards and scored two touchdowns on 20 carries for FIU. 

Padrick threw for 281 yards and two touchdowns but blemished his performance with two interceptions.

"We have to come out and finish games and learn how to finish people," Smith said in the post-game conference.

"It's really disappointing," added John Haritan, the team's leading tackler. "They are a great program. We played well in the first half, but in the second [we] just let it slip away."

The Golden Panthers hopes for a first winning season will have to wait until at least 2005. The loss clinches FIU's third straight sub-.500 season since the programs inception in 2001.

Headline: Rouco to count on rookie Simms for big minutes
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
During the wear and tear of four straight losing seasons, it has been tough for the FIU's men's basketball team to find a positive outlook.

 But with the season kicking off this Friday, new coach Sergio Rouco along with his recruiting class, hope thing can change.

One of those new hopes stands six and a half feet tall and carries a Colgate smile - Kenny Simms.

The New Jersey native comes to South Florida, offering a light at the end of the tunnel for the basketball program. 

Despite being a freshman, great things are expected of Simms.

"[We expect] a little bit of everything from him," said Rouco. "He's done well in the exhibition games, and we expect him to play a lot of minutes."

Along with new recruits forward Ismael N'Diaye (power forward) and guards Cesar Chavez, Carlos Taylor and Alan Guyton, the Golden Panthers hope to rebound from a disappointing 5-22 season where they went 1-13 against teams in the Sun Belt Conference.

Simms comes from Jackson Memorial High School, in New Jersey where he averaged 18 points, 12 rebounds, and four blocked shots as a senior.  

Born in Queens, New York to Alfio and Doidro, Simms took on basketball at a very young age and gradually developed into a complete player.  

With great support from his mother, he pursued his dream to play at the next level.

"[My mom] always told me to work hard and that education was most important," Simms said.  "But when she saw I was for real about playing basketball, she supported me all the way."

Named to all-state team as a senior, all-league twice, and four times all-county. Simms led his team to an 18-8 record and the school's first division championship in over 20 years.

"I was one of the premiere players in high school, and my team always relied on me to win.  It has helped me to be a more aggressive player now," Simms said.

Thanks to his playing skills in high school and growing stature, Simms started to be recruited by Rutgers, Niagara, Seton Hall, and FIU in tenth grade.

"[Former head coach Donnie Marshall] started recruiting me since my sophomore year," Simms said. "I liked the university and realized that none of those other schools were the proper fit for me."

After playing  small and power forwards  in high school, Simms must make a transition to center in college. 

 Coming into the Fall semester out of shape, Simms hit the weight room and lost 20 pounds to prepare him for the physically daunting task of defending the paint in Division I basketball.

"I knew that around here, I couldn't get away with the little elbows and stuff I used to do.  I had to be stronger,"  he said.

Someone who has helped Simms make the transition has is senior center Byron Burnett.

"[Byron Burnett] used to dominate me in practice, because I used to be too upright when guarding him.  He told me to get low when defending in the post, and now, I don't get pushed around," Simms said.

The team will base part of its strategy on the athletic ability of the big men due to the lack of size. On defense, they will trap the baseline and the paint to not allow anyone on one match ups.  On offense, they will run a full court game that will consist of fast breaks and pushing the ball down the floor.

Simms will have a big impact on this type of offense.  With the experience of playing the small and power forward, Simms is used to running down the floor and using his athleticism.

"I feel I have the quickest feet of all the big men; I know I can bring a lot of energy when I'm out there.  My coaches told me to do whatever it takes to get the job done."

With new coach Sergio Rouco at the helm, the FIU players have a new focus.

"There's no more joking around.  All the two and three year players are sick of losing.  The atmosphere is very tense and no one is taking days off."

With tough opponents like UConn (University of Connecticut) and a new young core of players, the Golden Panthers will take the floor with a new plan and a new mind set.

Simms's ability has convinced the squad, and they trust that he will serve as a crucial backup to Burnett. Since the beginning of training camp, Rouco has watched Simms' development with interest and is pleased with the results.

"He's our most improved player," Rouco said. "It's tough for a freshman to come in a Division I program and pick up things right away, but he has. We expect a lot of him, and we are not treating him as a freshman."

Headline: Trivalities of life don't bother student
Author: Jose Aparicio / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
We seem to have reached a half-way point, and after so many tests and papers, I just feel like sleeping in the fetal position in my bed all day. This extends to much more than just school though. I mean, I don't feel like going to work. I'm in an existential dilemma where I'm wondering if any of this has any meaning at all, and I wonder why I should keep going.

But these are things we must do, things we are used to doing day in and day out, like lab rats, and a degree is our cheese. It's never the big things that make us go crazy. It's all the trivial little things that get to us. 

It's stopping at the gas station for cigarettes and gas. The gas costs $2.20 a gallon and they don't have the cigarettes I want. It's driving around for 20 minutes to find a parking spot on the fifth floor, and then the garage elevator doesn't work. It's climbing down the five flights of stairs to realize  that I  forgot my lighter, which is on top of the book I need for class, which I placed in the seat next to me in the car so I wouldn't forget it. 

Now I'm running late for class and can't get a cup of that nasty coffee they sell at school. Now because I was late,  the girl from class with the pretty smile is talking to someone else. With no caffeine in my system, and after the long walk, I fall asleep in class and miss most of the notes. Sweaty, tired and annoyed, I lose a little more of my sanity. 

But the day doesn't stop there. There is traffic on the way home, and I can't find the CD I want to hear. Once home, I find out that the financial aid check still hasn't arrived. 

I am hungry, and I grab a Coke from the kitchen. I put the Coke in a cup with lots of ice and head off to study. As I sit down the Coke spills all over me and onto the floor, leaving it feeling like a movie theater's floor and leaving my crotch feeling like ...  a wet crotch. Then I bend over to tie my shoe, and the shoelace breaks.

The hunger strikes harder now, but I only have $5 to last until Friday, and it's only Tuesday. Now the question becomes: Do I want food, or do I want to buy cigarettes tomorrow? Opting for the cigarettes means it's another night of Ramen noodles. Heating them up I realize there is no clean silverware, so the noodles go cold as I find and wash a fork. Sitting down to eat cold food in sticky, cold pants, there is nothing to watch on TV. 

Finally, it's time to start studying. I slip out of my sticky pants and sit down at the desk to get some work done. Then I realize that I left my books in the car. After looking for my keys for an hour, I finally get my books out of the car and begin to study. As I begin to read and take notes, my pen runs out of ink. 

So, remember this next time you sit down to write a paper or study: When you work on the computer constantly save your work.  

Make sure your pen has plenty of ink, and don't let the trivialities of life get to you. Remember to laugh; it's better than crying when things go pear shape.

Headline: Maidique to present medical school proposal
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
President Modesto A. Maidique and several of the FIU's provosts will travel to Tallahassee on Nov. 18 to submit a presentation regarding FIU's allopathic medical school initiative to the Florida Board of Governors.

The presentation follows a preliminary proposal submitted to the Board in July which members of the administration considered to be a key step in the medical school initiative's decade-long journey.

"Although this meeting may be considered a review of the plan that has already been submitted, we're looking forward to the Board's critiques of that plan, which will give us an opportunity to further improve the [initiative]," said Vice Provost Thomas Breslin, a member of the Florida Council for Educational Policy, Research and Improvement. This organization first brought the the the state's rising lack of doctors to the Board's attention.

During the presentation, President Maidique will explain the importance and necessity of a new Florida medical school in a 10 minute Power Point slide show. By focusing on the current lack of 200,000 physicians across the state, he is expected to relay the message that Florida needs new, younger doctors who are more likely to stay in areas where they studied.

"What we're in shortage of are doctors who understand the needs of the community, especially here in South Florida, where the diversity plays a key role in that community. We need physicians who can understand that," Breslin said.

Following FIU's presentation, the Board of Governors will spend 30 minutes asking the President questions. The panel  is expected to touch on subjects such as the expected cost of the program and the economic impact of the school on both South Florida and the state.

"We're not expecting a quick decision," said Breslin. "We know we're going to wait for this, but we're  making great progress as we go along."

However, FIU is not the only school making such progress. UCF, which has also shown interest in developing a medical program of their own, will be meeting with the Board sometime in the coming weeks, although their own proposal has still not been made public. Still, the Orlando university's Board of Trustees approved the foundation of a biomedical sciences college in July, a move which UCF states  solidifies their intent to gain a medical school. 

FIU has also set up programs in anticipation of the initiative's approval.The Honors College currently holds a transfer program with USF. Through this program, students from the Honors College are able to study pre-med at USF after their third year at FIU.

According to Breslin, the expansion of the Health and Life Sciences building can also be seen as a major boost for the proposal, show-casing the determination and potential for growth FIU has.

FIU currently has $9.1 million reserved for the medical school and will  ask for $11.3 million more next year. Eventually, administrators hope to gain $40 million to found and construct the new college, which is expected to house research labs, a 400 seat auditorium, offices and centers for medical students to train while taking their residency.

Still, the growth of these programs does not necessarily herald the Board's approval of the school.

"If the legislature says yes, it will take two years to officially open the school. Even then, there is a long training time for students seeking medical degrees. The longer we put this off, the longer we'll be pinched by the shortage of doctors," Breslin said.

President Maidique's presentation will take place at 12:30 p.m. in the Turlington Building, Tallahasse. Earlier in the day, administrators will present the case for implementing a Ph.D in Public Health at FIU, another way for the health sciences program to expand and pave the way for a medical school.

Headline: Theater's lack of seats sparks complaints
Author: Elizabeth Prochet / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students and faculty scrambled to get tickets on Oct. 14 for the FIU theater debut of "Dracula," the first play of the 2004 school year. However, some audience members in the crowded theater found that they had to walk across the stage to get to the first available fold-out chairs, which served as extra seating.

"If you're selling tickets for an event, then there should be a seat for every ticket that's sold. It's not fair that paying customers have to stand and watch [the play]," said Yuraisy Velazcon, a freshman, who attended the Oct. 22 showing.

The box office and Theater Department may not be to blame, however, as the turn out for the shows completely amazed them.

"We released 'Dracula' because it was during the time of Halloween, and we thought people would go see it, because the story of the play is fitting for the holiday," said Marilyn Skow, advisor and professor for the theater program. "It really came as a surprise to [the theatre department]. We were not expecting such a huge turn out for this production."

According to Skow, this might be the reason why there wasn't enough room for the 95 people who purchased tickets for the October 14-24 showings. Another could be that "Dracula" was performed in the "Black Box," a venue used only to entertain smal audiences. It also provides more flexibility for stage design.

"[The "Black Box" can hold] up to 145 people but in order to accommodate the stage design the seating area had to be cut back," Skow said. 

But, according to the Theater Department, students shouldn't expect all the FIU theatre productions to be as cramped as the first; their next play "Romeo and Juliet," which runs Nov. 11 to  21, will be held in the second of the three rooms for on-stage productions, the "Proscenium House." Although the Proscenium House's restricted space limits technical stage designs, it holds about 235 people, significantly more than the "Black Box." 

"Because 'Romeo and Juliet' is more of a popular play, we anticipate a larger number of guests to come and see it," Skow said. 

There is also a third performance room, which doesn't have a specific name but it located in DM 150. This room is mostly used by theater students to put on much smaller plays and rehearsals.

Headline: UP Apartments stabbing fuels campus rumors
Author: Eric Peña / Police Beat
&nbsp;
Students at the University Park campus met with some disturbing news on Nov. 9 after a 33-year old graduate student was found in his bathroom with a knife wound to his chest. 

The event took place in Building J of the University Park Apartments.

According to Alberto Alfonso, the Public Safety investigator assigned to the case, the student's roommate made the discovery late that afternoon.

Although the roommate was in their room during the incident, Alfonso said that he had nothing to do with the unfortunate event.

The wound appeared to be self-inflicted, but because the victim was unable to talk due to sedatives administered at Jackson Memorial's Ryder Trauma Center, this could not be confirmed.

The knife, recovered at the scene, entered the student's heart cavity but missed any vital organs. The student went into shock as a result of massive blood loss but was in stable condition at the time of The Beacon's investigation.

Though the reasons behind the stabbing have yet to be determined, Alfonso said statements from the student's friends pointed to possible reasons for his actions. These reasons include his grandmother's death in September and a recent breakup with his long-term girlfriend.

As the appearance of ambulances fueled rumors around campus, students and administrators exhibited mixed reactions to the situation.

"There weren't people running around acting crazy or anything; we were all more surprised than shocked.  But I don't think it has sunk in to most of the residents that there was a stabbing here," said Katherine Rahmes, a resident of the Apartments. "I thought the University did a good job in handling the situation so as not to cause panic.  But I think they could've done a better job keeping the people out of the building who shouldn't have been there. There were people everywhere," Rahmes said.

However, some of the residents did have reservations regarding the University officials' handling of the incident.

 "[The administration] refused to tell us any details about what was going on. We didn't know if there was a killer on the loose or if it was self-inflicted or what," said Melanie Hesbacher, a resident of the Apartment's J Building. "All they told us was to not worry. They want to give an impression of 'community' here, but I felt like we weren't being told the whole story; the students here want to be informed because we do care for one another. Also, I haven't heard any updates, either, except for what was being shown on the news." 

The day after the incident, Dr. Rosa Jones, vice president for Student Affairs and Human Resources, released a memorandum to the housing community outlining the events. "The University Police Department is actively investigating the situation...and at this time [is] not pursuing a second person," the memo stated. It also told residents they would eventually receive information as it was made available.

Members of the administration declined to comment on the situation, citing the open status of the case with the Department of Public Safety.

Headline: Remember, calories still count
Author: Barbara Quinn / Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
Some issues were not up for debate. Americans are too fat. We don't eat enough fruits and vegetables. And we have no idea what a normal "portion" looks like. Other topics were the right news at the right time: We need to get off our duffs and exercise at least 30 minutes five to seven days a week. 

We could save this nation a heck of a lot of money and health woes if we would better integrate nutrition therapies into medical care.

Still, there was much to be debated at the recent Food and Nutrition Conference sponsored by the American Dietetic Association _ the largest organization of nutrition professionals in the world.

This country is currently engaged in a low-carb craze. Based on what we know now, what would you say to Americans who struggle to lose weight?

Read my lips: "Calories still count." Problem is, very few people in this great country seem to know what a calorie IS. For the record, calories are units of energy your body derives from food. Calories are found in protein, fat, carbohydrates and alcohol. If you put more calories into your body than it needs for energy, the excess will be converted to fat.

You make the point that calories count. Yet even experts agree that after three to six months on any type of diet, most people "plateau" and find it difficult to lose more weight. Is this a vast right-wing conspiracy?

Blame your body. After a certain period of weight loss, it tries to compensate by trying to hold on to whatever fat it has left. If you give up at this point, you'll probably regain the weight you lost. 

Stay on course with your diet and shake up your exercise routine a bit (like adding weight lifting) to convince your fat to surrender.

Researchers at the recent Food and Nutrition Conference told pregnant women to eat more fish to enhance the brain development of their offspring. Yet mercury poisoning is a very real threat from fish. How do you justify this recommendation?



Fish is the best source of DHA _ an omega-3 fatty acid necessary for brain and eye development in growing babies. You can also get omega-3 fats in plant foods like flax seed, flax oil and walnuts. Fish, however, is the best source of pre-formed DHA, the type best incorporated into growing brains. Fish like salmon, tuna, trout, sardines and halibut are good sources of DHA. It is true that pregnant women should not eat big fish like shark, swordfish, king mackerel or tilefish, according to the latest warning by the Food and Drug Administration (bigger fish accumulate more mercury). 



However, women can safely eat up to 12 ounces of other fish each week.



Do you believe this country needs more nuts? If so, how many and what kind?



Research has found that a handful of nuts like almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, walnuts and even peanuts a few times a week can help control blood pressure, lower cholesterol and may even help reduce the risk for some cancers. Walnuts are particularly high in linolenic acid _ the healthful omega-3 fat found in fish. 



A coalition of experts recommend we eat about an ounce of nuts four or five times a week for the health benefits. One ounce is about 23 almonds, 28 peanuts, or eight walnut halves. And don't forget to count the calories!

Headline: Brazilian professor brings unique perspective to dance program
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
"Brazilian culture, in general, loves dance," said Augusto Soledade, dance professor and choreographer. Born in Bahia in northern Brazil, it is not surprising that he was drawn to a career in dance. 

He always had an artistic inclination and dabbled the visual arts--- painting, drawing, and sculpting--- before choosing dance. 

Journalism was his first career choice, and he received his journalism degree from the Federal University of Bahia. 

Yet after initial on-the-job experience, life as a journalist did not hold the same appeal. 

Therefore, he redirected his energy toward a dance career and returned to the same university for a dance degree. 

Soledade cited Clyde  Morgen, American choreographer and dance professor as his main counselor, who helped him to pursue his dance career. 

In 1995, he came to the U.S. and attended SUNY Brockport, where he received his M.F.A. in dance. 

After completing his graduate studies, he undertook what he considers to be his greatest accomplishment--- the formation of the Brazz Dance Theater. 

It is a dance company comprised of his former students who travel throughout the country performing a fusion of Afro-Brazilian and contemporary dance. 

Since receiving his M.F.A., he has taught and performed at several schools throughout the country, including Wells College, the University of Rochester and Smith College.  

Soledade explained that he came to FIU because the position required someone who specialized in African Diasporic dance, his major research interest. 

He is committed to teaching and promoting African Diasporic dance, because he feels that the contributions of African cultures to dance have been severely minimized. 

One of his classes this semester, African Diaspora III, focuses  Afro-Brazilian traditions. He is also teaching a modern dance course using Afro-fusion dance techniques and a performance studies course, which teaches students to understand performance.

When asked about his future goals, Soledade expressed his sincere hope that FIU students will show an interest in and an appreciation for the arts. 

He will do his part to help promote the dance and theatre program as he and his students perform at the Faculty Concert, March 4 -6 and 11-13. 

Several of Soledad's Brazz Dance Theater members will visit this spring to perform throughout South Florida as he becomes more engaged in the community.

Headline: Romeo and Juliet with a twist
Subheadline: Interracial couple struggles in modern  American setting
Author: Betsy Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Professor Phillip M. Church sits on the edge of the stage dressed in black. When he gives stage directions, his hands twirl in the air like dizzy ballerinas. Scene after scene, the silhouettes of the actors on stage reflect in  his oval-shaped glasses. At the end of rehearsal, 30 pairs of ears listen to every word of his constructive criticism.     

Church has remastered Shakespeare's most celebrated love story, "Romeo and Juliet," and it is the upcoming attraction at University Park's Wertheim Performing Arts Center.

The new uncoventional production is set in a modern-day American city. Romeo (Jaren Rivas) is a young high school student and son to a wealthy American oil baron. He fights for the love of Juliet (Chrissie Fit), the teenage daughter of a prosperous Iranian art investor. 

This story of love and hate, although slightly twisted, comes at a significant moment in our history. 

 "I think it's going to be a great play, because it focuses on the issues that are affecting America today. Our generation can definitely identify," said Damion Rochester, who plays Mercutio.  

Church admits that his inspiration came from an article he recently read in the Miami Herald about a U.S. soldier who fell in love with an Iraqi woman. According to Church, their love for each other was so powerful that they fled the country and married in Germany. 

 "It's theater with a message. The audience will leave feeling like they gained something. It's exciting to present an old story in a new light," said Fit.	

 The newfound love between Romeo and Juliet deepens along with the between the two feuding families, the Montagues and the Capulets. 

Hoping for a resolution, Doctor Lawrence (Kris Cardenas), and Juliet's Native American nurse (LaVonne Canfield), intervene with inellectual and spiritual powers to settle the catastrophe. 

 "This is a production that is trying to heal the space between East and West. If we could feel it, we could heal it. I truly feel that the Native American spirit could perform that healing," said Church.	

Despite their passionate struggle, the destiny of these star-crossed lovers is ultimately sealed. They leave the audience with the striking reminder that hatred can lead to the tragic loss of innocence.  

"There are many important issues being addressed in this production," said Abel Conejo, the production business manager.

Church's new version of the old love story offers a variety of newly tooled scenes. 

They include a barbecue party scene for a soldier returning from the war in Iraq, an ancient Persian party scene, and a graden scene instead of the famous balcony scene.

"It is not about religion. It really is about the absence of respect and understanding toward a culture that is foreign and alien. It's a huge task, but we will be achieving it with honesty," said Church.

The performance will be running from Nov. 11 to 24. Show times are Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. General admission is $10, and student admission is $8.
