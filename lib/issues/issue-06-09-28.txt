Headline: Golden Panthers: Better team than record indicates?
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
I hate it when people say a team is better than their record indicates. But in the case of the 0-4 FIU football team, it may be a fairly accurate description.

After yet another close loss - this time a 14-10 heartbreaker at the hands of Maryland - the Golden Panthers have lost by a combined total of 11 points.

You can point the finger at FIU's seemingly anemic offense but the reality is that FIU came in to most of these games pretty overmatched - especially this last game against Maryland.

You have to give it to the FIU defense and special teams who have kept FIU within striking distance every game this season.

Yet at what point do you start expecting FIU to win? 

The team has been given somewhat of a forgiveness policy because it has been the underdog in every game this season, so a loss was, technically, a foregone conclusion anyway.

However, FIU has blown a shot at winning in every game this season ­- whether it was because of a missed extra point, a late fumble or a late interception.

For the second consecutive week, senior quarterback Josh Padrick had a chance to lead his team to victory with a late fourth quarter drive; and for the second consecutive week, Padrick threw a drive-killing interception that ended FIU's threat and, subsequently, the game.

True, the Golden Panthers have lost their four games this year by a combined total of 11 points against supposedly superior opponents, but they have also blown a shot of winning each of those games.

So, can you really say FIU is better than their record indicates? Or does the record accurately indicate what this team really is: a team that cannot win?

You can answer "probably" to both of those questions and you wouldn't be wrong.

However, you wouldn't be right either.

It all depends on how you look at it.

FIU clearly has an inability to put the game away and come-from-behind to win. 

But FIU has clearly played superior opponents - at least on paper.

The argument for either side is a double-edged sword, because you're either making excuses for the football team - an apologist, if you will - or you're being too harsh - after all, the program is only five years old.

Sadly, FIU is featured in David Duffy's weekly Bottom 10 on ESPN.com ­- the 10 worst teams in college football. What's even worse is the fact that FIU is lumped in with Florida Atlantic.

And even though FAU is also 0-4, it has lost its games by a combined 172 points. 

Talk about unfair.

Who the hell wants to be lumped together with FAU?

I guess it just goes to show you that no matter how many points you lose by - whether it is by one or one million ­- it still goes down as a loss.

Headline: Record-breaking plays fail to yield first win of 2006
Author: Charle Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Despite solid individual performances by various players throughout the season, FIU hasn't been able to turn those trendy stats and records into wins.

"I know for sure we're the best 0-4 team in the nation," senior linebacker Alexander Bostic III told The Miami Herald after the 14-10 loss to Maryland. 

FIU has lost all their games this season by a total of 11 points and has not lost a game by more than six points all season. 

Many coaches and players feel that the team could easily be undefeated if a few mistakes during crucial moments weren't made.

"We know how close we are," coach Don Strock said. "We will go back to work this week and work on the little things like we do every week. When you have a chance to make plays you have to make them; it is that simple. When you play on the road you have to make plays. Obviously, we did not make enough."

Some players have been stepping up to Strock's challenge by making plays.

In the loss to Maryland, junior defensive back Lionell Singleton intercepted his fifth pass of the season which tied the single season interception held by former defensive back Nick Turnbell who caught five interceptions in 2002 and 2004.

In the previous game against Bowling Green, Singleton ran back a 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown that tied the school record held by Gregg Moss, who set it on Sept. 27, 2003, against Carson Newman. Not to mention he is tied for most interceptions in the country.

Singleton was the only player breaking records against Maryland. In the second quarter with 8:07 left to play, senior quarterback Josh Pardrick completed the longest touchdown pass in school history by delivering an 89-yard strike to senior tight end Samuel Smith.

Even freshman punter Chris Cook garnered some accolades when his 61-yard punt after FIU's first possession broke the school record by one yard.

Despite all of the records and statistics, FIU will be looking for their first victory this weekend against defending Sun Belt champions Arkansas State, who pummeled FIU 66-24 last year.

Although frustrated, the team still remains focused and optimistic that they can still win the conference and earn FIU's first bowl birth in school history.

"We lost the first [four] games, but one of them was only a conference game so we still have a shot to win the Sun Belt," Padrick said.

We have to go out there and prepare for every game but those [non-conference] games, like Bowling Green, USF, Alabama and Miami, those games are just good for the University but for Troy and all those conference games, those are the games we need to concentrate on for the post-season."

And winning the Sun Belt is still a reasonable goal as FIU begins the bulk of its conference play.

Heading into conference play, senior wide receiver Chandler Williams, Padrick, and sophomore running back A'mod Ned are ranked first among Sun Belt Conference players at their positions for yards gained.

"It hurts," sophomore center Xavier Shannon said. "We know at the end of every game that we are the better team. It is one or two plays that make the difference."

Headline: Late interception stalls chance at first victory
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For the fourth time in as many games, FIU was the victim of another heartbreaker. 

FIU (0-4, 0-1) came up two yards short of beating 21-point favorite Maryland (3-1), falling 14-10 Sept. 23 at Byrd Stadium.

With time expiring, senior quarterback Josh Padrick threw an interception at the host's 2-yard line in an attempt to win the game.

The Golden Panthers defense kept the team in the game and allowed them to have a chance to win their first contest of the season, but instead FIU dropped it's fourth straight decision by a combined 11 points. 

Padrick stepped onto the field for the final drive with 1:35 to play and 80 yards to cover. Despite throwing a couple of questionable short passes that chewed up the clock and having to convert a fourth down, the senior signal caller fired down field, connecting with senior wide receiver Chandler Williams for a 45-yard completion as well as a first down and goal at the Terrapins 9-yard line with two seconds to play. 

The offense quickly got down field without any timeouts, as the clock stops in college football with a first down. Before the referee blew the whistle, the fifth official in the booth started the clock and Padrick was forced to quickly snap the ball. 

With all the commotion, Padrick failed to find Williams in the back of the end zone and threw right into the hands of Maryland defensive back Christian Varner, ending the Golden Panther threat just short of the biggest upset in the program's history. 

"When you play on the road you have to make plays," admitted coach Don Strock following the loss. "Obviously we did not make enough."

Despite the interception, Padrick finished the night 15 of 32 for 221 yards and a touchdown. More importantly, the offensive line held strongly as the senior was not sacked for the first time this season. 

"It hurts," said sophomore center Xavier Shannon. "We know at the end of every game that we are the better team. It's one or two plays that make the difference." 

A'mod Ned led the way for FIU on the ground, managing 96 yards on 15 carries. 

"As the game went on," acknowledged Shannon, "we realized they are just like us. They put their pants on the same and everybody wears helmets. We started picking up the running game."

The Golden Panthers fell behind with 4:23 to play in the first quarter following a sack by senior linebacker Alexander Bostic III. He was flagged for a 15-yard facemask penalty that gave the Terrapins a first down. Maryland quarterback Sam Hollenbach then connected from 13 yards out with running back Josh Allen, putting the home side up 7-0.

It took until the 8:07 mark of the second quarter for FIU to stun the home crowd, doing it in record fashion.

Padrick connected with tight end Samuel Smith, who was wide open in the middle of the field. The senior, considered one of the best in the conference and country, broke free for an 89-yard touchdown down the sideline to tie the contest at seven -- the longest in FIU history, surpassing the 71-yard touchdown connection between Padrick and former Golden Panther Cory McKinney against Florida A&M in 2004.   

The second half belonged to the defenses.

Neither team managed any points until FIU freshman kicker Dustin Rivest connected from 26 yards out with 10:42 to play, cutting the lead to four, 14-10. 

Strock looked back at his team's play calling as one of the areas the Golden Panthers need to work on. 

"We know how close we are," said Strock. "We tried some different things in the second half. Some of it worked and some of it did not. In the third quarter, we called six plays max and that is not winning football. You have to be able to establish the run and we did not do that."

Junior defensive back Lionell Singleton managed an interception midway through the second quarter, raising his season total to five. Senior defensive end Antwan Barnes, who had a quick start to the season with four sacks against Middle Tennessee in the season opener, was, once again, sack-less for his third straight game in a row. 

Following the loss, Bostic's attitude showed how this team feels about their four losses, losing by an average of 2.75 points per game. 

"[Ralph Freidgen] came out and shook our hands at the end of the game in the locker room and said, 'Good job'. [I'm] tired of it,"said Bostic. "I told our coaches to leave [the locker room] before the game and I told my team that if they don't believe we can win, they shouldn't step on the field."

Ned sees improvement in his team's play as the running holes finally seem to be opening up as the young offensive line gains confidence.

"We have to work harder in practice, and learn how to execute down the stretch," said Ned. "We're getting better. Our whole team is young, so we have no choice but to get better." 

The football team will look for its first victory Sept. 30 at 6 p.m. at home against conference rival Arkansas State, a team that beat the Golden Panthers 66-24 last season.

"We're going to go into the next game strong. I'm tired of these moral victories. Before we came here, [Ralph Friedgen] called us the best 0-3 team in the nation. You can't be a good 0-4 team."

Subheadline: Metrorail should stop at 107th St.
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As part of the FIU community, The Beacon supports the students and Student Government Association members who argued that the Metrorail station that is scheduled to arrive at FIU by 2015 should be located at SW 16th Street and 107th Avenue.

The purpose of extending the Metrorail line to FIU in the first place is to facilitate, not encumber, transportation to and from the University.

Placing the station on either side of the turnpike, as the City of Sweetwater commission insisted, would altogether betray that purpose.

Though the turnpike option on 117th Street would technically still stop near campus, it would not be as close to the main classroom buildings as the 107th Ave. station.

This distance problem poses several serious inconveniences.

Miami is a rainy city. On any given day, heavy rains or light showers are just as likely to start up unannounced. Under even the mildest rain, the long walk from 117th Street to the classroom buildings would become impractical.

A station by the turnpike would also pose a security risk to FIU students.

Unless more lightposts are placed on that side of campus, the path from buildings to the stop would most likely be dark and abandoned, a danger to students walking back from classes late at night.

Placing the Metrorail station on 107th Avenue would not only benefit FIU students. A stop along this route would eventually end near the Miami-Dade County bus station located between UP and Tamiami Park. This would allow residents of Sweetwater and nearby areas convenient access to the Metrorail service.

Moreover, the 107th Avenue station would be closer to the Fair Expo Center.

When the Dade County Youth Fair and Exhibition is up, fair attendees and FIU faculty and staff compete for parking. A Metrorail station close to the fairgrounds would alleviate traffic since less visitors would arrive by car, easing the situation for the FIU community.

If Miami-Dade Transit is going to invest millions of dollars to extend the Metrorail line all the way to FIU, it should make its effort worthwhile.

That means locating the Metrorail station next to the FIU campus, and not just its general vicinity.

Subheadline: Misconceptions about global warming obscure the truth
Author: Paul Benavides / Sophomore / Psychology Major
&nbsp;
Jessica Garcia-Iñiguez's opinion piece, "Some Like it Cold: Global Climate Prediction Theory, not Fact," from the Sept. 18 issue of  The Beacon, is filled with false assumptions and inaccuracies.

In her subtitle, Garcia-Iñiguez makes the false claim that scientific theories equate to fact. Theories and predictions in the field of academic science are presented under the principles of peer review, oversight and debate, but never assign themselves as fact.  

"Facts," or carefully collected data, support the presentation of scientific theories.  The scientific method never proposes that theory be "established as fact" or "be taken as truth."  

Inaccuracies are then presented, concerning the "debate surrounding global warming" and "how unsure we are about these theories" because, according to Garcia-Iñiguez, there hasn't been any "properly correlated evidence" presented about global climate change.

Global warming and anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change has been supported by large amounts of recent scientific study. There is no longer a "debate" about their impacts.  This conclusion has been reached by very reputable sources, such as the National Academy of Sciences, the American Meteorological Society, the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, to name a few.  

I recommend to all who are concerned to read the synthesis report by the UN-created Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of 2001, which represents the scientific consensus on global warming. We should also anticipate their latest comprehensive report due out next year.   

More recently, the legitimate concern over global warming has reached new developments in U.S. public policy (of which Garcia-Iñiguez also ignores).

Garcia-Iñiguez's entire article asks only one question: "So who's telling the truth?" I encourage anyone who is honestly concerned to find out, and not accept Garcia-Iñiguez's defeatist attitude that "we may never understand it in our lifetime." College students should know better than this.

Headline: Faith in God does not pay
Author: Albert Bodden / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"The things that we run from are the things that we run to," goes the old adage. This was certainly in my mind most of last week after reading an article in Time magazine about the prosperity gospel, "Does God want you to be rich?" Coincidentally, my pastor is preaching on a series regarding Christian families, and the topic for last week was finances. On top of that, there is a wealth of blogging rapid fire being exchanged over the topic. 

People often ask why there are so many religions or denominations within the Christian faith that ask for money. Normally, I prefer to sidestep those types of questions - not because they are not important, but because they may be irrelevant if a person doesn't have sufficient understanding of the faith. If we do not believe in the authority of the Bible, then everything else - including the tithes and offerings - would be nothing more than empty rituals. 

 The prosperity gospel has been interpreted widely by many denominations of Christianity today and remains a highly contested doctrine. Basically, this doctrine tells you that if you believe in God, He will bless you monetarily. Guest speakers on Trinity Broadcast Network, like T. D. Jakes, and Christian radio broadcasters will often ask for financial contributions, stating that if you send a donation, then God will give you manifold the amount donated.  While there is no objection on my part in supporting specific causes one believes in, there is something inherently wrong when we presume God to be our "sugar daddy." 

I've actually seen someone whose belief in this doctrine led her to write a list with specific items: a mansion-type house, a luxury car and many other items totaling close to half a million dollars. I have also heard of a pastor who wrote checks that drew on funds she did not have because her faith told her that God would "provide." Needless to say, the checks bounced due to insufficient funds.

Proponents of the prosperity doctrine would say that these people did not have enough faith, rather than admit their erroneous interpretation of biblical scripture. 

They would probably say that the millions of faithful Christians worldwide who are poor are probably just in sin. Any benevolence they do, particularly in giving money, is more as an "insurance" to protect their own interest rather than out of a sincere heart. 

 The problem with the prosperity gospel is that the moment one starts to believe that God will open up the skies and pour down his blessings with dollar signs, then our object of worship is money and God is the means by which we achieve our end.

Most of the Bible isn't about property or wealth, it's about a perfect God reconciling sinners to Himself, and the Old Testament is in preparation of the coming of the Savior.

I do want to keep an open mind, though. If there is anyone who adheres to the prosperity gospel, you can show me your "faith" by sending a cashier's check or money order; I will only take personal checks if they do not exceed $500 and show proof that you have a CD in the same bank. 

I cannot promise that God will bless your obedience, but I'd be happy to send you a thank you card with the song, "I'm A Believer."

Headline: Spa owners defend new business
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
The Waves Spa opened its doors for business in the Graham Center in Febuary 2006 and has often been ridiculed by students for not serving any purpose, as it appeared that no one ever uses the spa.

In reality, Waves has over 2,000 clients according to its owner Isa Ruiz.

"We struggle like any other new business," said Ruiz. "The exact number of students we get every week depends on what's going on, like finals."

According to Ruiz, 80 percent of the spa's customers are students and the remaining 20 percent include faculty and individuals outside the University. Waves pays FIU a 10 percent commission from business received serving as rent, said Felecia Townsend, director of Business Services.

Waves always seems to be deserted  because the bulk of its customers prefer to receive their treatment in a private room. 

"We have four treatment rooms. Two are used for massage, bodywork and acupuncture. One is used for Rolfing and is equipped with a special table for the procedure. And the last is used for facials," Ruiz said. 

Waves provides various unique services such as Rolfing, a type of massage therapy that can involve extreme manipulation of  muscles to improve posture among other health benefits. 

Rolfing can be extra beneficial for athletes and those suffering from chronic pain when they undergo the Rolfing Ten Series, a ten-week treatment plan. The treatment can be intense and some would consider it painful, but the lasting effect of Rolfing is apparent according to David Ruiz, Isa Ruiz's husband and co-owner of Waves, who is certified to perform the procedure.

"I had ten customers in one day last week and I was exhausted by the end of the day," David Ruiz said.

Also offered is the Eminence skin care line. Eminence is available only in one other location in Miami, the Shore Club Spa. 

Joyce Menendez, an off-campus client of Waves, is currently in the middle of a Rolfing Ten Series and plans to continue the therapy after the ten-week program concludes. 

"They offer awesome services and have the best prices," said Menendez.

While Menendez believes the pricing at Waves to be reasonable, some students at FIU say otherwise. 

"I think it's a beautiful spa, but it's too expensive," said Senior Faaiza Basit. "Their deals aren't that great."

According to Isa Ruiz, the prices at Waves are still lower than most spas. The Rolfing Ten Series costs $900 at Waves, or $90 a session. The national average cost for one session is $150.

The most popular special at Waves is the Waves package that includes an hour long full body massage and a customized 50-minute facial. It would cost an extra $30 to have the procedures done separately. 

"When you go to other spas they will charge you for everything during a full body massage. At Waves, we charge a flat fee for everything," Isa Ruiz said.  

Some spas will charge clients extra for deep tissue and aromatherapy, but at Waves those services are included in the flat fee. For the student in a hurry and low on funds, the spa also has dollar-a-minute massage chairs set up in the middle of the store. 

"I usually prefer the private rooms, but when I'm in a hurry I use the chairs. It's a great stress relief," said sophomore Dimitri Etienne.

Waves is also in the process of adding a new service for FIU faculty.

"We are now actively focusing on developing a program which will allow on-campus departments to request our therapists to come to their offices to provide chair massages at scheduled appointments. Many corporations offer this service and once the details are finalized, we will notify the departments via campus mail," Isa Ruiz said. 

The Spa also wishes to cater more to the athletes on campus. However, Gigi Garcia, head athletic trainer, says that the Athletics department handles massages when it comes to FIU's athletes.  

"We provide massages for injuries," said Garcia. "We are the first to come in contact when an injury occurs."

So while Garcia does not intend to incorporate Waves in treating athletes, she commented that it's fine for an athlete to go to Waves for a "feel good" massage. 

The staff at Waves can answer any questions through their website, http://www.wavesspafiu.com. The site also has discount information.

Headline: Center helps disabled students find jobs
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Disability Resource Center has begun a new partnership with Career Services that will offer special services to students with disabilities to increase their marketability in the work force after graduation.

The partnership, officially named the Johnson Scholarship Foundation Career Services Program, has been dubbed Degrees Plus due to the extra mentorship and resources it provides beyond the degree.

Program Assistant Michele Williams told of a student who recently graduated with a 3.7 GPA in information technology but has been unable to find meaningful employment.

"Why should he be a bagboy in Publix?" Williams said. 

According to the 2000 Census, over 40 percent of people with disabilities are unemployed.

The Center received a three-year grant to operate the program, but the process of administering the grant has been slow. 

"There were a few administrative hurdles in getting the project underway, but we're still following our timeline. We are currently taking registrations from students," said Amanda Niguidula, associate director for the Disability resource Center at University Park.

In addition to grants, the Center receives federal and state funds to help FIU comply with the Rehabilitation of the Handicapped Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Proceeds obtained from the Center's annual gala event also provide additional funds that support graduate student scholarships.

"We pride ourselves in the ability to grant students scholarships to offset the costs of their education," Niguidula said. 

Since 2000, the Center's graduation statistics have increased by a large margin, from 14 to 95 graduates.

Williams accounts the increase on the  exponential growth of scholarship awards. In 2002, $42,200 was awarded in scholarship money. Last year that sum increased to $119,818.

"When the students don't have to worry about working to pay for college, they can concentrate on school and simply do better," Niguidula said.

Darren Gregory, who has cerebral palsy, said the Center has helped him in a variety of ways. Each semester it sends letters to his professors to inform them of his disability and the type of accommodations he needs.

"They help me with testing, because I get double time. Also, if there is a rushed quiz, I get help with my physical writing." he said.

Gregory is graduating soon.

"I'm definitely going to be using [the Center] when I'm done because they have a unique insight on my needs and they know the dynamic of working with people with varying disabilities," he said.

Staff at the Center regularly help students receive appropriate accommodations.

Junior Cristina Alvarez has septo-optic dysplasia, a condition that makes her blind in one eye. She receives time and half for tests and reports, as needed.

"I only use [the Center] if I really need it. It keeps me more relaxed because I know I can take more time and have a greater chance of getting things done right," Alvarez said. 

Junior Ileana Rodriguez has benefited from the special CAT labs available in the Green Library at the University Park campus. 

"They are more comfortable and allow you to lower the tables," she said, which helps to accommodate students in wheelchairs like herself.

The lab also offers a variety of software and other technology that aids students with disabilities.

"We're always adding new technology," said Niguidula, "and we always listen to students' input and ask for their feedback."

One device that has received great reviews is the video telephone, which allows deaf students to talk on a regular phone while they watch a translator sign the conversation on a screen. 

Students also like the Braille typewriter in the  office.

"What we have here is almost state-of-the-art," said Williams.

The Center is already preparing for midterms week, which other than finals week, is its busiest time of the year.

"It gets really packed in the office," said senior Bianca Carrasco, both a student and Center employee.

"Last year I got blisters from running from class to class picking up and delivering exams to professors," Carrasco said.

In years past, demand has been so high that staff members have given up their offices to serve as quiet testing rooms.

Last year alone the Center served over 760 students and proctored over 1,600 exams. They expect this year, with record enrollment, to be no exception.

"We can always use more volunteers," Williams said.

Headline: THE KRONOS QUARTET @ Gusman Theater
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Kronos Quartet's reputation is more akin to that of rock stars than of classical musicians. This is due as much to their laid-back concert attire as to their emotional, energetic performances that abandon the often times rigid formality of the classical establishment. They have cemented that image with their numerous collaborations with Mexican rock legends Café Tacuba and a joint effort with electronic collage artist Clint Mansell to produce the score for the movie "Requiem for a Dream."

Since they started playing together in 1974, Kronos Quartet has recorded more than 30 albums for the label Nonesuch, mostly featuring 20th century composers and ethnic genres, and have won six Grammy nominations and one award for Best New Composition. 

However, for a group with a catalogue of some 600 songs, Kronos Quartet could have picked a better repertoire for its Sept. 22 performance at the Gusman Theater. 

The performance started with a promising pair of songs. The first, a collage titled "Cat O'Nine Tails" by contemporary composer John Zorn, was true to the Quartet's taste for the avant garde. Rather than sitting down and writing a piece from beginning to end, Zorn's style is entirely scattered and spontaneous. Zorn jots down his ideas on index cards where ever and whenever inspiration stikes him, until he compiles a thick pile of discrete musical "moments." He then arranges these ideas - each entirely different from the other - into a coherent work. The end result is a jagged, seemingly improvisational piece that, on closer attention, reveals an underlying logic and vaguely linear progression. Kronos Quartet's frantic rendition of "Cat O'Nine Tails," with equally distributed moments of cartoonish playfulness and sadomasochism, was true to the song's subtitle - "Tex Avery Directs the Marquis de Sade." The song was a lesson in the versatility of string instruments; from cellos and violins, the Quartet extracted sounds of doors creaking, puppies whining, tippy-toeing feet, quick polkas and slow waltzes. 

The second piece was a euphoric excursion into the Quartet's other favorite genre: ethnic music. The piece, titled "Oh Mother, the Handsome Man Tortures Me," was adapted from an Iraqi pop song by an unknown author. Hank Dutt dropped his viola and grabbed a massive tambourine, which he shook violently and somehow expelled from it the equivalent of a complete percussion section. The remaining three members fiddled like madmen and managed to imitate all the Middle Eastern instruments used to play Iraqi chouba, sounding like anything but two violins and a cello.

The large remainder of the concert faded into a string of uninspired arrangements, mostly by Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov. Other pieces included Gabriela Lena Frank's "Inkarri," a dull, interminable composition in which five movements - each one indistinguishable from the others - all managed to sound like background music for a wedding photo slideshow. The lowest point of the concert was Golijov's "K'in Sventa Ch'ul Me'tik Kwadulupe," which integrated the recording of an Indian-Catholic ritual in Chiapas with meandering notes picked and scratched on violins. 

Kronos Quartet managed to half-redeem themselves with a pair of interesting encores. 

The first involved an array of scrap metal and power tools, which had materialized on stage by the time the lights came back on. Cellist Jeffrey Ziegler and second violinist John Sherba screeched bloody cacophony in the background while David Harrington banged on thick steel with hammers and crowbars and growled unholy demon noises on a staticky microphone. Hank Dutt provided accompainment with a metal grinder and a blowtorch.

The second encore was an interpretation of Jimi Hendrix's cover of the Star Spangled Banner. Now, covering Hendrix's Woodstock performance on cellos and violins is an ambitious, hit-or-miss affair. In this case, Kronos Quartet's shot at it and just barely missed its mark. It was certainly awe-inspiring to see a string quartet hammer out the same notes and sounds with which Hendrix broke all musical conventions in the 60s, in a historical rendition of the national anthem that transformed it into political protest. And to see hard rock-style tapping on a violin is way, way cool. But cranking up the volume on string instruments does not turn classical musicians into rock performers, and the Quartet's "Star-Spangled Banner" gave concertgoers a farewell that was more irritating than impressive.

Subheadline: THE STROKES @ Club Cinema
Author: Jessica Iser / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Sunday brought along one of the most well known indie bands, The Strokes, to Pompano Beach's Club Cinema. The sold-out crowd consisted of quite a mix of people, everyone from die-hard Strokes fans to those who have probably only heard "Juicebox" on the radio. Either way, everyone who went to the show got what they paid for and more. 

The opening band for the show wasn't listed along with the tour date, so there was a bit of speculation as to who it would be. Jimmy Fallon opened for The Strokes on a few of their '02 tour dates, and they have also shared the stage with everyone from Har Mar Superstar to Tom Petty. So it was disappointing to find out that The Strokes went with a fairly unknown local band called Big Bang Radio. 

My apologies to all four of their fans, but Big Bang Radio was possibly the most generic sounding band The Strokes could've picked, and the audience made sure they let them know how much they stunk. All throughout their set, hecklers booed and yelled out, "You suck!" several times. Big Bang's set was bad but bearable until they covered Prince's "Kiss." At that point, things made a turn for the worse. Lead singer Del tried his hardest to recreate Prince's falsetto but failed - miserably. 

After the cover song fiasco, Big Bang soldiered on for a few more songs before giving up the stage to The Strokes' road crew. They made themselves busy tuning the guitars, checking mics and putting beer on every flat surface on the stage. Standing room became scarce as latecomers and those who had escaped Big Bang Radio came in, and soon the air in the large room became very hot and stale with cigarette smoke. 

After a 45-minute wait, the band took to the stage. Lead singer Julian Casablancas drunkenly addressed the crowd and expressed how happy he was to be in "Pump-ano" several times. The fact that the lead singer was drunk out of his mind might have led some to think that they would perform horribly, but those who have seen them on other occasions knew that it would take a lot more booze for them to screw up.  

The last time I saw The Strokes was in 2002, and I was pretty impressed with them even though they had a pretty short set list. They had only one CD out, "Is This It?" and were working on their second album while on the road and testing out some of those songs on their audiences. The only difference this time around was they had a much larger catalogue of songs to choose from and their sound was much tighter.  

Every song was impeccably played and the crowd responded accordingly. They played songs off of their latest album such as "Heart in a Cage" and "Juicebox," and every person in the room sang along. But the icing on the cake came when they played some old favorites like "Hard to Explain," "Someday" and "Last Nite" as if five years hadn't passed since their debut.

After playing a nice sampling of several songs from all three albums, Casablancas decided they were comfortable enough to play "15 Minutes," a song from "First Impressions of Earth."

 "I think we'll try playing this, even though we haven't played it in a long time. We'll probably f**k it up," he told the crowd. They did slip up a few times and Julian fudged a few lyrics, but it was cool that they gave it a try and didn't care if they messed up in front of their fans and critics.

After venturing into a song that they didn't know so well, they launched into a song that only a handful of fans actually knew: "New York City Cops." The song was supposed to be on the North American release of "Is This It?" in 2001, but after 9/11, the song was pulled because of the line "New York City Cops, they ain't too smart." Because of this, it only showed up on the album's European release.

They ended the show with the same song they finished with the first time I saw them four years ago: "Take It Or Leave It." Looking around the room and seeing everyone lost in their own worlds, dancing and singing along to the music, one couldn't have asked for a better way to end the show.

Subheadline: LADYTRON @ Studio A
Author: Brennan Forsyth / WRGP General Manager
&nbsp;
Electronica Brit band Ladytron began its American tour with a routine sound check and in-depth interview before playing a packed show at Miami's Studio A on Sept. 20. Hours before the show, singer/guitarist Mira Aroyo and singer/keyboardist Helena Marnie sat down to discuss the band evolution and its future. Ladytron (which also includes members Daniel Hunt and Reuben Wu) also chose the night for the live world premiere of their song, "Send Me a Postcard."

When you first started in 1998 [sic], were there others who shared a similar sound?

Aroyo: There were those we liked and respected, but the reason why we kind of did this is because it wasn't out there, and we kind of started doing it to satisfy ourselves, 'cause we wanted to hear that kind of stuff.

Marnie: And in Liverpool at the time there wasn't really much electronic music, well, not like us. It was more like indie boy bands, really. 

Aroyo: Yeah, we were playing out music in clubs, in kind of indie clubs, and we wanted to hear music like that and there wasn't that much of it around, so we did it.

To be sure the music itself, especially with Witching Hour, has taken on a much darker sound, a much heavier sound than with past releases.

Marnie: Yeah, it's strange when you listen to the first album or even Light and Magic. The difference is kind of light years, I think.

Arroyo: Even, you know, when you listen to songs like "Evil" and you haven't heard them for a long time, but obviously you've been playing them for a long time, like constantly for a couple of years, and you know, it just sounds so different on record. It's just like…

Marnie: Like today in our hotel room, I had my laptop out and we were unpacking it and getting ready and whatever, and I just left it on play and the old version of, the first ever version of, "Evil" came on and Mira was like, "Oh my God!"

Aroyo: I hadn't heard it for a while, and it was like "wow."

Marnie: Yeah, it's quite strange.

Electronic elements are more and more finding their way into rock music. Do you think that popular rock music might be evolving along those lines or is it just a fad that coincides with the so-called 1980s revival?

Aroyo: It's definitely been more prominent in the last couple of years, but at the same time it kind of has this thing where it comes and it goes, and I think people are more acceptant now because of certain bands that have, you know, made it acceptable to have, like, you know, certain very 80s sounding sounds in their songs, more so probably than most electronic band actually have. So it's definitely become acceptable, but then, you know you listen to most R&B and pop music, and you know that's just probably some of the more probably sort of experimental music that's out there.

Here in America, Ladytron has seldom had difficulty attracting a crowd at any venue and all of this without any commercial radio play or regular rotation on any of the major music television networks. Is it the same over in Europe or do you find that there's more commercial support for Ladytron there?

Marnie: No. 

Aroyo: No.

Marnie: I think we do better in America, in North America.

Aroyo: It's a lot to do with student radio, actually. I think student radio has really helped us a lot. 

Marnie: Keep up the good work.

Aroyo: I mean … student radio isn't nearly as strong or as developed in Europe, unfortunately, or in England.

Marnie: Yeah.

Aroyo: So you're a lot more reliant on, you know, playlists of, like, BBC radio and such.

Marnie: Yeah, in the UK it's kind of non-existent. Yeah, there are student radios, but they don't really hold the same importance as over here.

Do you feel that Ladytron is at the forefront of so-called electroclash or electropunk?

Marnie: I don't think that exists anymore really.

It's still a name that's thrown around fairly liberally here in the States.

Marnie: I don't know, 'cause I think that we sound a lot different now maybe to other electronic bands.

Aroyo: I don't really think it exists that much as well, this movement. I mean, you know, there used to be a certain hype and there was a scene about it, and I think now it's a lot more spread out, because it kind of encompasses all like these other genres. You know it's spread into, like, you know, punk funk, and like, it seems to be a little bit more mixed together with just indie music. It's not as segregated. 

Marnie: So, no.

Aroyo: We're not at the forefront of anything.

Headline: Explicit Content...a sex and relationship column
Subheadline: Bisexuality taboo enforced by ignorance
Author: Dana A. Gruber
&nbsp;
When we are young, many of us are taught by our parents' example that a traditional relationship occurs between a man and a woman. In more conservative times, morality was the defining factor for saving oneself for a partner of the opposite sex. Since then, a sexual revolution has manifested itself within our society, transcending morals and progressing into an "anything goes" culture.

Heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality are a part of what people are. Bisexuality is a sexual orientation in which an individual feels sexual attraction toward both men and women, although not necessarily to the same degree. Bisexual people are not necessarily attracted equally to both genders, and tend to prefer one or the other. It is possible for a bisexual person to be attracted to all genders but only one kind of sex, or to all kinds of sex but only one gender.   

As a gender, women have always been affectionate toward one another. Hugging and kissing another female is commonplace between friends.

But, as a woman, has your libido ever taken a sexual turn for someone of the same sex? I am talking about that bi-curious feeling that lingers in the back of your head until it's quenched. 

In the 21st century, bisexuality has come out from behind closed doors and entered public attention through TV shows, feature films and music videos (especially when including the word "uncut").

Men's attitudes, however, are a different story. I realized through talking to some of them that it is completely "natural" for two women to be intimate, but two men together is completely out of the question (or so they want us to think). We see them patting their close male friends on the butt while out on the field;  would it be so bad to cup a handful and see all that it's cracked up to be?

A professor of mine stated that men in fact have a greater desire than women when it comes to having a bisexual encounter. Has a shift occurred in the tectonic plates of sexuality? I say yes. There is a whole subculture within our society that embraces open and experimental sexuality. There are "invite only" fetish events where various swingers and singles participate in an array of explicit activities and websites like MySpace where you can search for other swingers or those who are bi. Bisexuality is welcomed and even encouraged. However, one must note the differences in preference.

According to a fact sheet provided by the American Psychiatric Association, "a homosexual or bisexual individual may experience conflict with a homophobic society; however, such conflict is not a symptom of dysfunction in the individual." The APA Board recognized that a significant portion of homosexual and bisexual people were clearly satisfied with their sexual orientation and showed no signs of psychopathology.

If this is what scientists have determined, then what is it that makes many unwilling to be curious? I think it is because sexuality has been repressed for hundreds of years. At first, it was strictly a means of reproduction. Now it's something that can be highly pleasurable and entertaining. And because we have been told that it is wrong, it has made us much more eager to try and enjoy it, even if it involves someone of the same sex.

Headline: Preparation can ease grad school transition
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"I'm finally done! Technically I never have to set foot in another school again!" Thoughts like these may go through the minds of some students as they throw their graduation caps in the air. But in the case of other graduates, as they celebrate getting one degree, they're just looking to acquire another.

They know that grad school can not only prepare you to be more effective in your future career, but it can also make you more attractive to potential employers. They know that the cost will be high and the studying grueling, but that according to USA Today, it can make their annual income increase up to about $20,000. They know it can also help them pursue their passion instead of settling for a job they'll soon hate.

Micah Mintz, first year grad student in political science and government, agrees that his graduate experience so far has been worthwhile.

"I enjoy grad school, although it is certainly more rigorous and methodological than undergrad," Mintz said. 

For many, even if they have the desire to attend for the above reasons, the thought of applying can be intimidating. Requirements differ for every school and even for every program, but covering all the bases will help students send in those applications with confidence and determination that this is the right step for them. 

1. Research 



Beginning in your junior year, start looking up potential schools, sorting them by location, cost and reputation. Ask yourself where you prefer living for the next few years, how much you're willing to spend and shoot for the most prestigious schools that fall into those two categories. It won't hurt to aim high. As a safety net, apply to about 10 schools in total.

Jackie Cabrera, call center representative at the Graduate Admissions Office at FIU, agrees that doing research in advance is key to the application process.

"Just do your research and find out what program you're interested in," Cabrera said. "The GPA requirement and whether you need to take the GRE will vary from program to program." 

Like many applicants, Dayane Moura, first-year psychology grad student, made her school choice based on location and cost. 

"The major reason that I'm continuing at FIU is the convenience of being there," Moura said. "It's close to my house, and the tuition is very good." 



2. Prepare for the GRE



Dust off the cobwebs from the algebra and analogy parts of your brain that perhaps you haven't used much since the SAT. Invest in one of those thick practice books. They're available at practically every major bookstore, including FIU's University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus bookstores. 



3. Be well-rounded



Grad schools like to see students who are involved in activities and clubs on campus, both related and unrelated to their major. They admire passion for extracurricular activities, and of course, for excellence in grades. 

"I really believe they look at how much dedication you've put into your undergraduate years of study," Moura explained. "That pulls a lot of weight in terms of how you're going to do in graduate school."



4. Network



Seek out professors in your major as mentors, not just for those all-important recommendation letters, but for their guidance.

Networking may also assist you in landing your dream internship, or in doing research alongside a favorite professor; that's how Moura got her current position as a graduate assistant. She works with two professors in the Department of Mental Health, researching information for grant proposals. She will even be teaching her very own class in October. In addition, she receives a tuition waiver, equivalent to $3,700 a semester, and a $15 hourly salary. 

"Most schools have this available," she explained. "It's competitive, but if it was possible for me, it can be for other students, too." 

Just like nearly everything else, grad school isn't ideal or necessary for everyone. For many, however, it can be that scary-yet-exciting next step in growing up, preparing us for our careers.

Headline: Unique date locales add spice to the ordinary
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Let's face it: dates can get boring after a while. Dinners, movies and dinner and a movie eventually become as boring as watching a turtle walk across your bedroom floor - twice. 

Livening up your relationship can be done in simple ways, including brainstorming some creative ideas for taking your partner out to anything that isn't the same old Chuck E. Cheese's you've been visiting since you first met.

Whether you're in the mood for some harmless fun or something morbid, here are some ideas you can use until your date wonders why you're still together:



Boxing



If your significant other is small in stature, then this is not a good idea.  Nevertheless, if both of you want to vent your aggression legally, then this is the proper medium. Throughout South Florida, several gyms offer boxing ring and punching bag rentals that can easily be used as a spot for dates. 

Although unorthodox, boxing offers a nice distraction from the mundane dating situation of watching "The Notebook" for the 15th time without falling asleep or bawling uncontrollably.

At South Florida Boxing Gym, located at 715 Washington Avenue on South Beach, first timers can take a free boxing class, which includes beating your own punching bag senselessly for an hour. Two full-sized boxing rings are also available for use.

Students like sophomore Shane Phen think it's a good date idea, but he admits there are some drawbacks.

"If you took someone boxing, they would definitely remember it," he said. "Still, the other person might be scared that you'll break their face."



Dance Classes



Couples who want something less brutal can skip the boxing ring and head to the dance floor. If both of you can't dance well, then taking dance classes together can be a humorous experience for you (and everyone else). 

Aside from possibly providing you with bruised feet, dance classes could also give you an idea of your partner's sense of rhythm, which may be used to interpret skills besides dancing, according to junior Roberto Bolona.

"I think dancing is a great way to break the touch barrier," he said. "Also, I believe how well you dance relates to how you are in the bedroom."

Salsa Kings, the salsa trainers found at University Park Monday though Thursday at 7:30 p.m., offer $6 beginner and advanced classes for students who are interested in learning some dance moves. 



Focus Groups



Want to get paid for spending time with your date? Focus groups provide the perfect opportunity to get to know your significant other better, make money doing so and test new products that could potentially kill you. If the date doesn't turn out well, at least you earned some cash.

The term "focus group" refers to a group of people chosen to give their opinions on products, especially new ones. You might test a new soft drink, a new video game or a new massage chair. Regardless, getting paid is a huge perk.

Senior Kristel Lopez considers focus groups a great way to have fun and make money simultaneously.

"If a guy takes me to a focus group, I would think it's clever of him because he ends up earning money for both of us instead of spending it," she said.

To find focus groups, you can check your local classifieds or the web site Miami.Backpage.com, which has listings for anything from bipolar studies to current social issues.



Graveyards



Do not try this unless you are in a long-term relationship. At first, a graveyard can seem intimidating, but it can serve as a place for introspection as well as celebrity sightings, albeit dead ones.

At Our Lady of Mercy Cemetery, 11411 NW 25th St., you can find the grave of actor and composer Jackie Gleason. Aside from celebrities, you can discover the burial sites of infamous individuals such as Meyer Lansky, a former Mafia member who is buried at Mount Nebo Memorial Gardens at 5900 Southwest 77th Ave. 

Junior Ana Ortega would only go to a graveyard under certain conditions.

"I would only go to a graveyard during the day, if at all," said Ortega. "Although it's different, it would be really creepy to go there at night."

Needless to say, try to stay away from family members' plots. The last thing anyone needs is to bawl uncontrollably at anything besides your personality - or "The Notebook."

Headline: Lecture addresses Congo's future
Author: Carla St. Louis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The president of the National Assembly of the Republic of Congo, Jean-Pierre Thystere-Tchicaya, spoke last Friday about issues interfering with the democratization of the Congolese government with a diverse group of students, faculty members and alumni Sept. 22.

"The biggest problem facing the political parties within the Congolese government is the lack of unity among the people, political candidates and society in general," Tchicaya said. 

Tchicaya's observations are seen in the history of the Congolese government. 

The Republic of Congo is comprised of three main communities: the Kongo, the Teke and the Ngala region. All adhere linguistically to the Bantu languages.

These ethnic tribes occupy various areas within the Republic of Congo and their territorial limits are expanding.

Since the Republic of Congo obtained its independence from France in 1960, the country's political infrastructure has been besieged by frequent coup d'etats backed by militias stemming from ethnic affinities and rivalries.

Tchicaya said he understands the challenges of democratization in his country. 

"The people are constantly divided and it's the biggest challenge to get the real democratization opposed to a unilateral government of the Republic of Congo," he said.

Tchicaya began his political career in 1971 as Minister of Technical, Professional and Superior Education where he supervised scientific research within the Republic of Congo. 

Following imprisonment  in 1984 - for which Tchicaya said he was wrongly accused   - he became an advocate for the democratization of the Republic of Congo.

"That is when I became convinced of the fundamentally arbitrary nature of the sole party regime," Tchicaya said.  "Ever since then, that's what I've been fighting for: the unification of the Congolese people."

By 1990, Tchicaya established a party based on the expansion of democratization within the Republic of Congo, the Rally for Democracy and Social Progress. 	

According to Tchicaya, his aspiration for the Congolese government is a transition from ethnic kinship as a form of political merit to a democratic approach.

"The Congolese government needs to change the devolution mode of power from lineage to democratic," Tchicaya said. "This philosophy that is commonly practiced within countries in Africa needs to be adaptive since it's not conducive of democratization."

Tchicaya plans on fulfilling his ambitions for his homeland by campaigning in the approaching 2007 Congolese legislative elections and  in the 2009 presidential cabinet.  

Once in office, Tchicaya plans to enact programs that propel unity.

"The essence of my programs will be to change the minds of the people; to educate the minds of the people with a new set of being," Tchicaya said. "A being that not only stresses motivation and competency, but one in which state pride is devised."

The event was organized by Rachel Caines, president of the International Relations Association at BBC along with various other faculty members.

 Students who attended the lecture agreed with the lecture's political themes. 

"[FIU students] cannot be idealistic about politics. We need to be active and make the changes ourselves,"  said Kiera Hill, an international Relations major.

"I really enjoyed this event; I felt that Dr. Thystere-Tchicaya's [lecture] diversified the students," said Lina Alqaddoumi, an advertising major.

Headline: Library celebrates formerly banned books
Author: Jessica Solis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"The Catcher in the Rye," "The Great Gatsby," and "Gone with the Wind" are books that are familiar to almost every college student. What many may not know, though, is that there have been several attempts to remove these and other books from libraries and schools across the country.

Banned Books Week, which takes place Sept. 23 to Sept. 30, is a celebration of the freedom to read those books, and the Biscayne Bay campus library is recognizing this right by informing the University about the importance of banned books.

"It's an opportunity to express our freedom to read," said Lauren Christos, reference librarian at the BBC Library and chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee for the Florida Library Association. "Not only can you read these books, but you can access them."

 To commemorate Banned Books Week, the Library will have a showing of the film adaptation of Ray Bradbury's novel, "Fahrenheit 451."

For the past five years, the library has had campus professors participate in readings of banned books, but the film screening this year is a new feature.

Started by the American Library Association in 1982, Banned Books Week seeks to remind people about the intellectual freedoms they have.

Every year books are challenged in libraries, schools and bookstores, but few are actually banned. 

A ban is when the materials are formally removed. Parents are the biggest group of challengers and it is evident by seeing the most challenged book of 2005, according to the ALA Website.

"It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health" was deemed inappropriate for the young age group it targets. Images and details of homosexuality, nudity, abortion and sex education shocked parents who opposed it and challenged the book.

Even the most popular of books have fought to stay in libraries and bookstores.

"Many people are not even aware that some of the books they have read have been banned or challenged," Christos said.

The Harry Potter books are to date the most challenged books of the 21st century, according to the ALA. 

Banned Books Week also brings to light the issue of censorship and the First Amendment.

"One, as students at any level, undergraduate or graduate, they require intellectual freedom to do their academic work. Also, intellectual freedom is necessary for professors to teach students. Without it, students can't do their work either," said BBC librarian Eduardo Fojo.

In Miami, the children's book "Vamos A Cuba (Let's Go To Cuba)" caused controversy  this year because many deemed the book's message untrue. Parents challenged the book asked for it to be removed from Miami-Dade public school libraries.

"I think withholding knowledge is one of the world's biggest tragedies" said sophomore Nellista Reid. 

"Censorship, when it comes to books, is an ultimate form of control. If you don't like it, don't read it," said senior Marisa Fialho

 The film will be shown Sept. 27 and 28 at 5 p.m. in LIB 150. For more information, call 305-919-5718.

Feminism, activism and equality: this is what the Women's Studies Student Association is all about.

The WSSA, originally founded in 2002, was formed to combat injustices against women. Sze Lee, the current president of WSSA, is planning some big changes for the organization.

"WSSA is going to be an extremely inclusive club from now on," Lee said. 

In the past there were some minor restrictions to joining WSSA, such as having to be a women's studies major. Under Lee's direction, virtually anyone can now join WSSA, including men.

"Equality for one is equality for all," Lee said. "Sometimes people think WSSA is only for women, but it is not."

In the past, WSSA has participated in many events nationwide for the betterment of women. 

In 2004, WSSA walked in the March for Women's Life in Washington D.C. and in 2005 the members journeyed to Tallahassee to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment. 

Thirty-five states have ratified the ERA; if three more states ratify the ERA, it may become an amendment to the constitution.

WSSA held its first meeting of the year Sept. 19. There, members discussed plans for the rest of the year. One of their main goals is the "Vagina Monologues." 

In 2005, WSSA was able to raise $9,000 through the controversial play. Eve Ensler, the author of the play, allows various groups to use the play for free as long as the proceeds were donated to charity.

WSSA were obligated to donate to the Women of Afghanistan charity and also chose to donate to the Victim Advocacy Center on campus and Mujer, which promotes the integral development of Latin American Women, emphasizing their rights and freedom.      

"Every seat was filled three days straight last year," Lee said. 

Auditions for this year's "Vagina Monologues" will be Oct. 2, Oct. 3 and Oct. 6 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in Deuxime Maison 213. WSSA also plans to give a sneak peak of their performance during Women's Day, Oct. 26, in the Graham Center pit at University Park.

New and old members were excited about the prospects for the new year during the first meeting of WSSA.

"I want to experience a lot of things about activism," said international student Eunjeong Chung. Chung also commented that in Japan things tend to be more serene and thus less controversial; meaning there are not many activist groups like WSSA willing to take a stand.

"The WSSA is a natural ally of the National Organization for Women," said Robin Butkovitz, the president of the FIU chapter of National Organization for Women and newest member of WSSA. 

In the past WSSA and NOW co-sponsored events such as the Day of Silence. Butkovitz hopes that with her position in both organizations-as well as the Stonewall Pride Alliance where Butkovitz is vice-president-she will be able to contribute even more to women's rights. 

WSSA operates out of the Women's Studies Center located in DM 212. The center also provides supplemental funding to WSSA. 

According to Lee, without funds from the center and matching donations from outside sources, WSSA would not be able to operate as it has in the past. 

Anyone who is interested in equal rights is encouraged to join WSSA. For meeting times see www.fiu.edu/~WSSA and www.fiu.edu/~wstudies for more information.
