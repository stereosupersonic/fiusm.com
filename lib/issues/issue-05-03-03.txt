Subheadline: Wine and food festival provides international flavor
Author: Erik Tirums / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This weekend's fourth annual South Beach Food and Wine Festival helped solidify Miami's growing reputation as a bastion of good cuisine. From FIU students and Michelin French chefs to cooking demonstrations and dinners that cost upwards of $450 dollars a plate, "foodies" and amateur wine drinkers alike, enjoyed the event which even showcased many different categories of food, wines and spirits. 

As a college student, professional cook and budding wine aficionado, the most economical and educational event was the Grand Tasting Tent. Tickets to this were $100 compared to the $300 and up for restaurant dinners. I arrived at the festival after work around 1p.m. on Saturday afternoon, and unfortunately missed the demonstrations of Mario Batali and Ming Tsai (who had just finished and was signing books), so I took my free Hummer H2 gift bag and complimentary wine glass and headed past the vendors of All-Clad and Illy espresso straight into the tasting tents to begin my day.

The events surrounding February 25-27 started with a kick-off gala called the Bubble Q at the Delano Hotel. Oddly but appropriatly named, the BubbleQ featured a tent on the beach with barbecue items and Moet and Chandon-sponsored wine pairings. 

After I enjoyed a Miami night with Moet Champagne and barbecue, the next day started with cooking demonstrations from famous chefs such as Ming Tsai, Rachel Ray, Mario Batali and Emeril Lagasse. The day also featured tastings of 75 of Miami's finest restaurants and over 150 wines and spirits from around the world in the Target Grand Tasting Tent between 10th and 13th St. off of Ocean Drive.

The tents spanned the length of two Miami Beach blocks and were bustling with people, food, wine and spirits. A Moet and Chandon touch and taste area provided champagne mimosas, Hennessey chocolate truffles and vanilla infused cognac. Moving along inside the enormous tents provided me with samples of drinks that included Vineyards California Cabernet Sauvignon to New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs,  Hypnotiq shots, vodka martinis and a seemingly endless number of rums made into different mojitos.

 Surrounding all the liquor were Miami's restaurants showcasing their talents. Highlights included Chispa Restaurant's risotto with chorizo, Gaucho Rodizio's huge grill station with skirt steak, and Tantra's seared scallop with ginger foam and crispy collard greens. Though I spent many hours in the tasting tents, my day on the beach was broken up by watching the demonstrations.

The two demonstrations I attended were by Marcus Samuelsson (author of Acquavit and a New York City restauranteur/chef) and Anthony Bourdain (a New York City chef best known for his book Kitchen Confidential,  the host of  Food Network's "A Cook's Tour" . Samuelsson is a Swedish chef who specializes in combining Scandinavian with haute cuisine. He prepared gravlox (cured and smoked salmon) with a honey mustard glaze, and a peppercorn crusted beef tenderloin with bok choy prepared in coconut milk. Bourdain did more joking and answering questions than cooking but still prepared a duck confit white bean cassoulet. 

The demonstrations captured the essence of enjoying food and the attitude and casualness of South Beach. Samuelsson prepared his food with a casual smile, answering questions and wearing an A/X t-shirt, jeans and red Puma sneakers. 

Bourdain livened up the crowd a little more in a traditional chef coat,  jeans and his habit of cooking barefoot. He also managed to poke fun at famous chefs such like Emeril and Rachel Ray and praised  his  colleagues, Mario Batali and Thomas Keller. Though the  chefs and their food were different, an attitude of pure passion, joy and respect for food was conveyed in this perfect setting, less than 200 feet from the ocean.

The Grand Tasting Event was clearly the event for college students and the casual admirer of food and wine art, but it also provided the experienced "foodie" with a plethora of new experiences and tastes. 

Even though it sounds like a huge drunken event of debauchery (sometimes not a bad thing), one  can enjoy responsibly and without incident. 

Drinking and eating is unlimited under the tents. The ample supply of complimentary bottled water, clean and accessible restrooms, book signings and demonstrations helped to break up the tastings. This ensures that a full 11a.m.-5p.m. day can be enjoyed without over indulgence which could lead to a hang-over the next day.

Headline: Heart felt message delivered by Foxx
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On the evening of Feb. 27, Jamie Foxx stood before a star-studded crowd at the Oscars and thanked Ray Charles "for living." Foxx's performance as the world-famous and blind musician in the biopic "Ray" had just rendered him the coveted best actor statuette, in addition to a Golden Globe Critics' Choice award in the United States and London and a Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award.

But Foxx's most substantial thank you, after going through a list of names as per Oscar protocol, went to his deceased grandmother. He said that she taught him how to act and, teary-eyed, mentioned that now he could only talk to her in his dreams.

Similarly, the film "Ray" portrays Ray Charles's mother (Sharon Warren) as his first and most valuable mentor. 

She teaches the future genius pianist to stand up straight, be dignified and makes him promise to never let anybody treat him like a "cripple," because of his blindness. Before Ray's mother dies, she sends him to a boarding school for the blind. 

Ray Charles's past is a running theme in the film. Well-crafted cinematography intersperses flashbacks of Ray's childhood with scenes from his current situation, and depicts Ray's passion, brilliance, and triumphs alongside his vices and hardships.

The viewer finds out how Ray goes blind at seven years old, how death haunts him in childhood and how drugs almost ruin his career and life. Through it all though, Ray remains lovable and his musical journey and creations are no less incredible. 

Women turn out to be some of the greatest inspirations for the title character in "Ray." After drawing from his mother's strength, Ray relies on the steadfast devotion of his wife Bea (Kerry Washington), to get back on track before it's too late. 

Although Ray finds time to start a family, he's mostly on the road, where he finds female singers to share his passion for music - and his bed. One of the most remarkable scenes in the film takes place in a hotel room, where Ray and his mistress, Margie (Regina King) are arguing. Ray tells Margie to channel her anger into singing a song, while he plays the piano.

Under the tutelage of Ray Charles himself, shortly before the musician's death in June 2004, Foxx learned how to play and sing the songs Ray's way. Foxx was no stranger to the piano; he attended college on a music scholarship. But most striking is Foxx's emulation of Ray's movements.

 As CNN described, "Foxx doesn't just imitate Charles, he becomes him." Overall the performances of the actors are realistic and simply brilliant. Each of the  original characters subtle movements and glances are captured in "Ray," along with the escalating wonder at the title character's creative process. 

"Ray" was written and  directed  by Taylor Hackford, who has  another music-inspired film, under his belt "The Idolmaker" a documentary on Chuck Berry. Some of his other big productions are "Proof of Life" and "The Devil's Advocate." 

Although nominated for an Academy Award for best director for "Ray," Hackford lost to Clint Eastwood and "Ray" lost the best picture award to "Million Dollar Baby." However, "Ray" still won an Oscar for best Achievement in Sound and Jamie Foxx took home his own share of accolades. The film came out in theaters last October and is in high demand on DVD. 

Ray Charles must be flashing his signature smile of rapture from the beyond. Not only did the biopic movie soar at the box office, but  as Foxx said at the Oscars, people from all over the world were all "drowning in love" for the late musician. 

The night before the Oscars, Foxx told a reporter that an international audience enthusiastically sang along with him to Ray Charles's songs. 

Better yet for the real Ray, his final album, "Genius Loves Company," won eight Grammy awards this year.

Headline: Academy Awards best and worst leave audience bored
Author: Michelle Ferrer / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
The Academy Awards came and went on Sunday night and all we were left with was an empty pizza box and envy for the outfits and lives of our favorite actors and actresses.  Every year the Oscars roll around, each time with some high points and, of course, some very low points. Here are this year's, in case you missed the show:

Death by Award shows

Traditionally, award shows are boring. They always look the same. It's as if ABC just recycles the shows and plays them again and again, year after year, hoping that no one will notice. 

You can literally fall asleep midway through the show and wake up during the last twenty minutes feeling as if you hadn't missed a thing.

Duh-duh-DUH, is that Star Trek music?

The music they play each year when someone needs to get off stage, or just the music in general, sounds as if you're in the middle of a Star Trek episode instead of the glamorous Academy Awards. 

Third times's a charm

Did the Academy lose money this year? Did they not have enough funds to hire more than one entertainer per performance? For those of you who didn't watch, Beyoncé Knowles- Miss Destiny's Child herself- performed not once, not twice, but three times! Man, oh man. We apparently can't get enough of her.

They still play music?

Is it just me or did Counting Crows go out of style in the third grade? It seems as if the Academy wishes to take us into a blast from the past. I can almost hear myself singing "Long December." Oh my.

Pageant Styles

This year, the nominees in certain categories like Costume Design, were called on stage together like contestants in a beauty pageant for the announcement of the winner in their category. The winner would step forward, quickly say thanks to Mom and be rushed off stage before he/she could even process the fact that they won. 

On the bright side

The hilarious Chris Rock hosted this year's show. Without him the Academy might as well have handed out razor blades as they passed out the programs to the audience. 

Opening the show in true Rock style, he mocked the actors, the names of certain films and even touched a bit on the political situation in Iraq. Chris "rock-ed" the show. Excuse the pun, I couldn't resist.

Tackiness is back

Kathy Griffin, E!'s sassy comedian, was on the red carpet asking questions like the one's she asked at the Golden Globes, "What do you prefer? Purge or laxative?" She relaxed some extremely tense stars with her tacky comedic relief. 

It's all about the outfits

Why else watch the show? Everyone knows that if you are going to go to a formal event you want to rip off your favorite actor's outfit. Fishtail dresses seemed to be a favorite for actresses like Emmy Rossum and Renee Zellweger. 

In general, it's fun just to watch and pretend you had one of their Prada dresses.

Love it or hate it, it's the Academy Awards. It's addicting and for some reason you just can't get enough of it year after year.

This year the show was a bit more entertaining with a performance from Santana and presenters like Robin Williams and Kristen Dunst. Perhaps next year we'll be pleasantly surprised to find the show has taken on a completely new look and sound ... one can always hope.

Headline: Wide sampling of foods tempts festival visitors
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Ever think about being able to eat anything your heart desires? Well, this is exactly what I did at the fourth annual South Beach Wine and Food Festival held Feb. 25-27.

Hosted by FIU, the festival is one of the largest of its kind in Florida.

Everyone at the event had the pleasure of eating the best foods from the greatest chefs and enjoyed a wide variety of liquors and wines.

Walking into the event, I witnessed Food Network god Emeril Lagasse bang all his ingredients together as a crowd of over 300 people surrounded him. 

As I got past the Emeril kitchen stage, I walked into the first of two Grand Tasting Tents, where all the food and drinks were showcased. Everyone seemed to want a taste of a 75 perfect Zinfandel red wine by Ridge Vineyards, which my colleague called, "an extraordinarlly pure flavored wine."

Grown on the Monte Bello Ridge of California, the Zinfandel wine had people asking for doubles. 

"Serve me another glass, because my wife couldn't get enough," shouted a man from the left side of the wine booth. 

There were two mouth-watering meats that left me craving for more. The first was a juicy tender steak from Les Halles Brasserie Rostisserie. Cooked in an oven and served over the grill, the filet mignon steak literally dissolved in my mouth.

The second luscious meat came from Mancini's, a Tuscan Grille restaurant and bar located in the heart of Las Olas Blvd. This piece of meat, stacked on a homemade Italian bread cracker with a special sauce topped with sun-dried tomatoes, mixed a special flavor in my mouth.

There were two soups at the event that overwhelmed me with flavor. The first, a chilled curried root vegetable soup mixed perfectly with a caramel apple crisp pappadura. The second was a warm watercress soup that tingled with fresh salmon caviar; both soups were made by Lyon & Lyon, a restaurant located in West Palm Beach.

Sushi could not be left behind at the event. The restauant has several different locations in Miami. Sushi Maki showcased various kinds of sushi. Whether it was salmon, tuna or crab, Sushi Maki made you savor over their foods great taste. 

Not left behind was the mexican inspired sushi from Ian's Tropical Grill. It mixed a Mexican chimichanga with raw tuna inside, giving the dish gave a punch of flavor with every bite. Filled with wasabi, sour cream and guacamole, the flavor was exceptional.

To top off the amazing foods, I finished the day with a chocolate dessert. Baked by Lilyfield Cakes, this chocolate pound cake tasted just like the one my great grandmother used to make. With a chocolate so rich and pure, its essence felt like an exotic escape from reality. These cakes can be ordered through the company's website and are sent to customers through the mail.

But chocolate cake wasn't the only enjoyable treat at the festival - it was the people. People came from all over the globe to experience the only festival in South Florida that lets you eat, drink and be merry. Cheers!

Headline: DISCOVER; Resident Assistants
Author: Teresa Ronquillo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Nervously walking down the hall and dressed up in a suit and tie, Eric Pena had just completed one of the final tasks involved in a lengthy and detailed process. 

 For over two weeks, in addition to his usual course load, Pena has attended numerous meetings, participated in many group sessions and fulfilled other individual tasks required for this process.  He did all this because he is applying to be a resident assistant (RA) for the FIU housing community at the University Park campus.  

For those who live in housing, RAs are known as leaders, mentors, law enforcers, helpers and friends. Their purpose is to aid in times of trouble and discipline in times of resident misbehavior.  Most often seen at the front desk of any housing building and roaming the halls, RAs play a huge role in the FIU housing community.  

RAs are the select group of students who live and work in FIUs residence halls to assist residents.  Aside from staff and committee meetings that often last hours, RAs have a variety of duties they must fulfill. 

Once a week, they are assigned a "duty day" - a time during in which they cannot leave their building.  

During this time, RAs must help out at their resident hall's front desk. Working the front desk consists of a range of tasks, which vary according to the resident hall in which the RA works.  Tasks range from checking out kitchen and computer lab keys to residents to assigning mailboxes and answering phone calls.

During rounds, the RAs must walk through their entire building, checking every hallway, kitchen, lounge, stairwell and garbage room, making sure everything is okay and as it should be according to the Resident Handbook and Calendar. 

If something isn't in order, the RAs job is to correct the situation by either filling out a write-up form for the resident at fault, contacting maintenance to clean up a mess in the garbage room, or informing residents that blaring John Tesh music at 10 p.m. is unacceptable. Although some RAs say the job is very time consuming, respect from students is what RAs hope for.

"I don't mind them most of the time, but I don't like  it when residents don't respect the community," said Paola Echegaray, an RA and senior majoring in international relations. "It's frustrating as an RA and does make the job hard at times."

In addition to the duties they complete on a weekly basis, RAs are also responsible for organizing community events for their residents.

  These events follow the PACED (Personal development, Academics, Campus Event, Enhancement of community, Diversity) program, with a total of five events, one in each category.  

For example, Echegaray put together an Asian-themed study lounge as the academic event for her floor of the housing community.  As her enhancement of community program, she had an evening in which her residents got together and decorated t-shirts representing their community.

Despite having to plan community events, the primary responsibility of the RA is to simply make themselves available to their residents as much as possible.  

"Even with all the events and doing rounds and whatnot, as an RA, there is always that feeling that you aren't doing enough," Echegaray said. "The residents are always on your mind, and you often feel like there's so much more you should be doing for them." 

Even though RAs spend much of their time attending to residents' needs, RAs are paid $170 bi-weekly and receive free housing on campus. 

According to Echegaray, pay will be increasing in the coming year, but these are just small pluses that come with the job.

"The best part about it is the light repertoire moments I have with the residents while simply passing in the hallway," Echegaray said. "I love the relationships I've made with them."  

Residential Life is currently selecting new resident assistants for the 2005-2006 academic year. Applications are now available and can be picked up at the Office of Housing and Residential Life. Aside from filling out the application, interested students must attend a series of meetings, interviews and group information sessions led by a selection committee that will eventually choose the RAs for the coming year.  

The group sessions are classes that include a textbook and homework. Candidates must also follow a current RA around for a shift and learn how to carry out specific tasks at the front desk.  

Despite the lengthy application process and the added classes, prospective RAs say that they enjoy the process.

"It's a good [application] process. It's lengthy to show commitment, has good opportunities for group interaction and allows us to show our individual abilities," said Pena. 

According to Resident Life Coordinator Prakash Karnani, the best type of applicant is patient enough to deal with all kinds of students on a variety of levels.

"A diversity of qualities in resident assistants is what makes our RA teams effective when working with our diverse population here at FIU," said Karnani.  "Above all, a resident assistant must have a genuine interest in working with students and helping them succeed at FIU."

Courtney Seymour, an RA applicant, thinks the rewards are worth the wait.

"In the long run, if I receive the position I think I'll be able to help a lot of people and impact their lives," said Seymour, a freshman majoring in journalism.

Pena and Seymour, along with the other applicants, will find out March 14 if they have been selected as RAs for the next semester.

Lighters to be banned on airline flights

Following a decision by the Transportation Security Administration and Congress, airport security screener's will begin to ban all butane lighters on April 14. The ban reflects Congress' fear that lighters could be used to ignite bombs on planes or otherwise damage or destroy bombs. 

The TSA until now had banned all but butane lighters and said each passenger could carry no more than two.

TSA hopes that the new ban will streamline security procedures, because in the past screener's had to distinguish between butane lighters and types that were banned.

The Department of Transportation bans lighters in checked baggage, so passengers wanting to keep them have few options aside from returning to their cars to stow lighters or handing them off to non-fliers. 

The U.S. Postal Service considers lighters to be hazardous material and will not mail them.

Despite the new ban, passengers can continue to carry up to four books of matches, but that too is under reconsideration, according to TSA.

Headline: Atrium construction to continue
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Sophomore Damira Whitely, a commuter student from Pembroke Pines, likes to spend her time between classes at the University Park Graham Center, doing homework or just relaxing in the study area by the glass casing of the new Atrium.

"Because I live so far, I've got to stay on campus until my next class starts," Whitely said. "I like sitting in this place now because it isn't as loud as the food court, and I like watching people through that big glass thing. I don't know why it's here, but I think it looks pretty."

The new expansion, popularly known as the GC Atrium, came about during the over $5 million state-sponsored renovation and expansion of the GC in the last three years. Although the area officially opened in November of last year, it still attracts much attention and puzzlement from many students who don't quite know what to make of the space.

"I saw them building it and thought it was great, but now that's it finished, I still don't get what the purpose is," said junior Tom Kingston.

GC Director Ruth Hamilton, however, assured students that the Atrium  will serve an important function, though that purpose might still not be clear.

"The responses we've been receiving as to how we should use the area have been numerous," said Hamilton.

Hamilton mentioned several of the ideas currently being discussed including reserving the space for bands and DJs, placing a speech podium there in time for Student Government Association elections and even installing a hologram machine which would project the image of a panther against the glass atrium's shell.

"We have many plans in store for that space, and we just have to coordinate with various student organizations and see what the best options are," Hamilton said.

For now, the study area, composed of tables and chairs set up in the atrium's rotunda during the day, is cleared at night for the use of salsa and tango classes.

Besides the study area, plans are also in the works for a new food court along the wall directly facing the glass.

"Six months ago, we had been thinking about several venues to install there, among them Subway, Burger King and an Italian concept service," Hamilton said.

Director for the Office of Student Affairs, auxiliaries and operations, James Wassenaar, stated that the only venue that has been assured a place in the expansion is the Subway that currently occupies the food court by Gracie's Grill.

According to Wassenaar, the Subway's new locale will provide space for the long lines which usually form around the eatery window and cram the current food court area.

The other food services that will accompany Subways will soon be determined.

"We have to go through some processes - see what students, faculty and staff would find necessary and set up bids to attract the wanted services," said associate director of Business Services, Felecia Townsend.

The university surveyed students and faculty  earlier in the semester regarding what food services they would like to have, not only in GC, but also at the kiosks and vending sites planned for the new recreational center, Frost Art Museum and Alva Chapman School of Business, which are all currently under construction.

"We should have the results of the survey in some time in March, and we're going to attach that to documents which we'll send out to companies for a bid," said Townsend.

Companies affiliated with the university will be the first to receive a bid statement, followed by any business that have shown an interest in FIU. Aramark, the food services corporation which currently operates most of the venues on campus, will also take part in the bidding.

The results of the bidding will not be known until the process is over.

"The business part is all that has to be carried out before the place is completed," Wassenaar said.

However, he also mentioned that, due to problems which arose during the final phases of the atrium's construction, the glass casing will have to be replaced.

"Because of the extent of the damage [to the glass] that was done by the cleaning company under the contractor's watch, we've required that they replace that glass, so we get the product that we paid for," Wassenaar said.

The refurbishing will take place in March, and Wassenaar states that the process will be a quick one.

Headline: Gala displays engineering students' latest projects
Author: Giovani Benitez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Eight-year-old Alex  could hardly remember his whole name, but he knew where he was Feb. 25. - at the College of Engineering for its annual gala, marking the end of National Engineering Week. Alex liked what he saw. 

"[I like it] when they battle each other with their cool [remote-controlled] cars and when they fly their airplanes with the little camera attached to it," said Alex.

He, along with over 1,300 other elementary school, middle school and high school students gathered as FIU students showed off their latest high-tech projects.

"We want more people to get technical and engineering degrees, because that's where the jobs are," said gala coordinator, Stephanie Strange. "We get kids here that maybe are not interested, because they've been bored by math or science, and if they see things that are interesting, it makes them want to do the work to get the degree."

FIU President Modesto A. Maidique echoed Strange's thoughts in his introductory speech during the opening of the event.

"No other profession has had a larger impact than engineering. It's very exciting," Maidique told the audience of young engineering students.

The solar-powered home was one of the more popular projects promoted at the gala. The 800-square-foot structure will be built on the Engineering Center's field. Construction begins in April. 

"We're trying to find a feasible way for people to build their own house from solar power and run it efficiently," said Danny Fattal, an architecture student on the house's design team.  

Once the small home is built and tested, it will be disassembled and sent to Washington, D.C. After arriving in the nation's capital, the solar-powered house will be reassembled and submitted for competition against projects from 18 other teams at the 2005 Solar Decathlon.

Also on display at the gala was a golf cart-like electrical car developed by the U.S. Department of Energy. 

Like most home electronics, the car uses a traditional power outlet to recharge its battery, but can only travel about 30 miles on a full charge. 

The electrical car and solar-powered home were just two of the 39 projects scheduled to be exhibited at the gala, but Strange said that less than 20 were actually presented. 

 Many of the students scheduled to put their projects on display never did, Strange added. 

Other events at the gala included a Legos competition, presentations of an artificial heart valve at the biomedical engineering lab and a demonstration of a model airplane that provided a bird's eye view of the campus using a small camera that was attached to it.

Headline: More students turning to jobs, tech colleges
Author: Teresa Mask / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Matt Graves has been growing his business for five years, and when he graduates from high school in June, Graves expects to focus on his MSG Lawn Care rather than attend a university like many of his peers.

But sometimes he fibs to avoid ridicule.

"I just say, `I don't know where I'm going yet,'" he confessed. "That's because everybody expects you to go to college."

But Graves, 17, who attends both Berkley High School and the Oakland Schools Technical Campus in Royal Oak, Mich., is confident that because he's good at his craft, a bachelor's degree is not required to make a decent wage.

According to the latest labor statistics and tales of success from the fields of carpentry, cosmetology and automotive engineering, to name a few, young people today can get a high-paying job without the debt and time that goes into four years of college.

Donald Trump believes, that, too. In this season of "The Apprentice," he's pitting high school graduates against the college graduates. And the high school grads are winning.

Life doesn't always imitate reality television.

The reality is that earning at least a bachelor's degree increases the odds of high wages, though there is a growing movement to embrace alternative paths to reaching comfortable salaries. On average nationwide, high school graduates can expect to earn about $27,280 annually, according to the 2002 Census Bureau Current Population Study. Those with associate's degrees can expect an average of $31,046, while those with a bachelor's can average $51,194.

Those salaries can fluctuate, depending on field and training.

With just high school experience, for instance, a mechanic can earn a salary in the mid-20s. But with a 2-year associate's degree, mechanics can net about $45,000, said Ken Schewe, director of education programs for the Detroit Auto Dealers Association. The bonus, he said, is that most times, students are working paid internships while they go to school and the dealership will pick up college costs.

"You can graduate debt-free and with money in your pocket," he said.

The best way to climb the salary scale is to continue to return for different certifications. Schewe said at least 30,000 new mechanics will be needed each year for the next decade to fill demand across the country.

"Technicians can make as much as doctors and lawyers now," he said.

And the rethinking about alternatives to a 4-year degree is coming from the top.

Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm has said that to prosper in today's economy, students need to pursue an education beyond the 12th grade-whether that is at a 4-year university, a community college, or technical training and apprenticeship program. To help finance higher education, Granholm has proposed that the state guarantee any student who completes an associate's degree or two years of a 4-year program, a $4,000 MERIT scholarship. The program would begin with the class of 2007.

The plan, no doubt, will shine a spotlight on community colleges, which often stand in the shadows of their university counterparts. And the incentive could pay off-literally-as recent high school graduates already are enrolling in community colleges in greater numbers than years past. At Henry Ford Community College in Dearborn, Mich., for instance, the 19 to 21-year-old enrollment has grown from 3,637 to 5,031 students during the past two years.

Similar growth can be seen in high school career-focused education programs, such as the four Oakland Schools technical campuses, where enrollment has increased by 23 percent, to more than 3,000 students in the past two years. The students sometimes are hired out of high school but, thanks to new cooperative agreements, many also continue their education at community colleges and universities.

Mike Soave, 18, of Southfield, Mich., developed his culinary techniques in high school at the Oakland Schools' Royal Oak technical campus. Now he's enhancing his skills at Oakland Community College, while working part-time at Papa Vino's restaurant in Troy, Mich.

"I want to be a chef, though I don't necessarily want to open my own restaurant," he said, adding that while he may go to a culinary school in the future, a bachelor's degree is not required. No longer is there a stigma about getting technical skills and working a so-called service job. But some educators say it's still tough convincing parents that their children don't have to take the 4-year route to gain success.

Redford Township, Mich., resident Dolly Marzka is not among those who need convincing.

She said young people should be able to follow their dreams, to find a job they are a passionate about. If it requires a degree, then so be it. If the 60-year-old grandmother had her way, all high school grads would dedicate two years of service to this country while they decide what they want to do.

She always knew what she wanted to with hers _ that's why the high school dropout got her diploma, then entered a trade school before she opened Ye Olde Barber Shoppe in Plymouth, Mich., which turns 25 this year.

"I will be cutting until I croak," she said. Said Richard Brown: a placement officer at Henry Ford Community College: "We value a university education. There is no question about that. But the problem we run into ... people are coming out with a bachelor's degree, pretty heavy-duty student debt, and there is no job for them."

"Is it possible for a person to become successful without a degree? Absolutely. You have to have passion and belief in yourself to do so."

Subheadline: gourmet Festival brings the best of wine and food to South beach
Author: Harry Coleman / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
Along the sandy shores of sunny South Beach sat two large Grand Tasting Tents filled with an extensive array of wine and food from around the globe ­­- all part of the fourth annual South Beach Wine and Food Festival. 

Held Feb. 25 - 27 and hosted by the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management and the Southern Wine & Spirits Beverage Management Center at FIU, the charity event brought together celebrity chefs and cooks for three days of eating, drinking and cooking. 

The event did not only focus on wine and food. Its primary purpose was to give some 500 HTM students a chance to plan, run and experience the sights and sounds of hosting a three-day event. 

"There is a lot of planning that went into it this year. [The event] gives you a taste for everything in hospitality management and how to satisfy the needs of the different restaurants that are here," said Estefania Montalvo, who majors in travel and tourism and was the service coordinator for the event. "I didn't expect the [crowd] to be so knowledgeable and have such an interest in exotic foods." 

With help from sponsors like Food & Wine Magazine, Target, Evian, Belvedere Vodka and Wine Spectator magazine, the sold-out event was a challenge many students said they were lucky to be a part of.

"This is the second year that I volunteer to work the Wine and Food Fest. Last year it wasn't as organized, but because we raised the prices in order to provide better safety, we have put up a much better event," said Margarita Lopez, who majors in hotel lodging and was part of the guest services student crew. "It's been hard, but I have learned a lot of responsibility and patience."

With superstar chefs like Emeril Lagasse, Tyler Florence, Mario Batali and Masaharu Morimoto, visitors had the opportunity to watch live cooking demonstrations that ran continuously throughout the day on three demonstration stages equipped with KitchenAid equipment. 

As part of the demonstrations, cooks like Rachel Ray cooked a SoBe inspired meal in her bikini and chatted with onlookers about her recent marriage and what it has been like to host two shows on the Food network.

"Kids! Kids! All my kids have four legs. I would be a horrible mother. I am never home," said Rachel Ray, the host of "30 Minute Meals" and "$40 a Day," about the possibility of having children. "I travel way too much. '$40 a day' is not as glamorous as it looks. I travel in a van with five guys, show up in Paris and show [the viewer] where they can find the Mona Lisa ... I don't even get to go in and see it for myself. I get a sample of what it would be like to visit Paris."

Apart from the live cooking demonstrations, visitors also had a chance to visit the Grand Tasting Village, where restaurants from across the country came to display the latest in culinary excellence and technique. 

"Being a part of the festival has been great. I've seen more food prepared in one day than I have since I have been in the program. I will be able to prepare food faster in the future," said Michael Christin, who majors in hotel management and culinary preparation, at the HTM programs table. 

As part of the event, 18,000-20,000 visitors also had the opportunity to taste foods and drink wine from all over the world. 

Some companies introduced new wines while others showed off their drink-mixing abilities with refreshing mixes of citrus, mango and alcohol. Frozen ice shots, a drink called "The X-rated Foreplay," and the new Bootie Beer were among the favorites of event attendees.

The festival not only gave companies the opportunity to display the best and newest in wine, food and mixed drinks, but many were able to give out free promotional items as well. 

Book signings were also held and guests were able to have the favorite celebrity chef sign their latest copy of the cookbooks he/she wrote. These books could be purchased on site at the festival.

According to Jenny Lopez, an HTM student and exhibitor coordinator for the north Grand Tasting Tent, the hard work pays off despite a few small planning mishaps.

"The event was a total success, everything was organized , and each year it gets better and better. We already have a lot planned that we want to do next year," said Lopez. "Students networked with a lot of amazing companies. The experience was extremely rewarding to see it all come together so well."

According to the volunteer manager for the festival, Ketri Foster, the participants, guests, sponsors and restaurants work well as a team.

"After a year of seeing it on paper and then seeing it at the end, it was worth the hard work. The event made a 180-degree turn from last year. Everyone who participated worked 100 percent as a team. It flowed very well. The event was amazing," said Foster.

Industry leaders recognized the HTM as one of the top-rated hospitality programs in the United States. The total amount of money collected to support the educational programs and facilities at the HTM was not available as of press time.

Headline: One is the lonliest number...
Author: Rayaad Dinally / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Every year, Forbes magazine comes out with a list of the 40 best cities for singles. The cities on the list are ranked according to various criteria which include nightlife, culture, job growth and, of course, the number of other singles in the city. The magazine's most recent findings placed Miami as the 10th best city on the list. 

This makes me wonder: If Miami is really so big in the singles department, why is it that every woman I know in this city is taken?

For some uncanny, supernatural reason beyond my control, I always  fall for the woman who has a boyfriend, a fiancée, or worst of all, a husband. Whenever I ask for a date, I usually get a variation of the line "Sorry, I'm spoken for." Some other sweet talking guy has beaten me to the punch, which makes me feel crummier than a Barry Manilow love song.

To add more insult to injury, most of the time I don't have an interest in the few women who show the slightest interest in me, just because they aren't my type. It's a lose-lose situation. 

It is bad enough to be single in a big city like ours, which is sometimes hyped as "The Magic City," but my luck with the opposite sex sometimes  makes me want to give up my wand. The right woman for me is certainly out there, but she's probably gay.

Most people that pass me by perceive me as either weird or quirky, attributes that don't work when it comes to matters of the heart. Yet they haven't failed me completely. I have had a few relationships with woman in the past; they have lasted as long as Jennifer Lopez's marriage. 

I have been let down so many times that I feel like I'll never find that person I can call "the one." The way I see it, love is just another four-letter expletive.

At this rate, I am afraid that 40 or 50 years from now, I am going to be that old cantankerous man who lives on the end of the street all alone, living off my social security check (assuming social security still exists) with my 75 cats. They would have names like Rhoda, Joey, Rocky II and Rocky III, all from TV shows and movie sequels. I see my bleak future based on solitude, gallons of milk and wall-to-wall kitty litter. 

I am aware that this information would be better shared with a therapist, but I also realize that I am perhaps looking for love in the wrong places. 

Maybe I could hit the slopes and go to Denver, which ranked number one on Forbes's list of the best cities for singles. I might not even have to leave the state. I could go to Orlando or Tampa (numbers 20 and 25 respectively). How about "steeling" away to Pittsburgh? Oh no ... wait ... it came in last.

Honestly, I don't know if I should enjoy eternally being a bachelor, or if I should brush up on my knowledge of the Bible and join a monastery. 

What I do know is that a magazine about money has left me very short changed. How disappointing.

Headline: Debate arises about religion in schools
Author: Dara Bramson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Christian Right, a formidable mass movement of activists who have worked with  the Reagan and Bush administrations, are highly involved in the current political scene. In December of 2004, they decided that the U.S. Constitution was just not good enough. 

Their agenda was to amend the Constitution and extract the provisions separating church and state. Rather than following the advice of the cliché, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," the Christian Right has decided to patent a new one: "If it ain't broke, break it!"

The news of the Christian Right's latest crusade sent shockwaves throughout the Jewish community.

An article in the Palm Beach Post Capital Bureau notes that Senator Daniel Webster, former Speaker of the House and now the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is exploring the possibility of a citizens' initiative to repeal the 136-year-old wording that separates church and state in Florida.

The First Amendment to the Constitution reads, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances." 

The amendment outlines provisions separating church and state. Many states implement these provisions more stringently and explicitly than the Constitution does. 

If nothing else, at least we have the support of Howard Simon, head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. 

"So, if the Constitution stands in the way of their radical agenda, don't change the radical agenda, change the Constitution," said Simon, in an interview cited in the Palm Beach Post Capital Bureau.

Journalist Austin Cline, who specializes in educating people about atheism and secular humanism, cites some of the reasons why the Christian Right's stance is so problematic. The advocacy for "more religion" in public schools by the Christian Right is clearly not in reference to every religion, but to Christianity.

"Few members of the Christian Right would like to see government money going to Muslim groups, Jehovah's Witnesses, santeria, Raelians and other religions they consider evil," Cline writes. "Laws that provide for public funding of religion however, will have to treat them just like any Baptist or Methodist church."

There is an enormous amount of parents in Florida who send their children to public schools and they are coherent enough to realize that there is no "correct" religion. We can deduce that Florida has maintained the separation of church and state for nearly fourteen decades. 

While there may have been generic prayer in Florida public schools, much of it was a non-denominational prayer, withholding names of specific deities. Parents have had the luxury of carrying on a stress-free day, knowing that their children would not return home having been converted to a new religion by their teacher. 

"You can't force a belief on a child," said junior Amy Harmon. "When a parent wants his/her child to learn about religion, he/she should be the only one having the option to make that decision."

This brings up the question: What about private schools? After attending private schools throughout elementary school, differentiating between the two was never complicated. Clearly, my belief is not that religion should be banned in all schools. Even at 11 years old, it was easy to understand that private schools exist so parents can tweak a specialized, usually religious plan of study for their child. 

Years after personally confronting this difference, it is unfortunate that many adults are hardly mature enough to realize what I did as an adolescent. 

A recent case in Staunton, Va. exemplifies the provincial attitude of some of these adults. 

According to CNN, public elementary schools in Staunton will continue to allow Bible classes during class time while the local school board conducts a one-year review to determine if criticism of the practice by some parents is valid.

Angie Whitesell, a school board member, said about the practice: "My conscience tells me this community needs this program, and we need to keep it." 

With Whitesell's conscience as her guide - and other people like her making similar decisions - it doesn't look like parents who oppose Bible reading in public schools will make any progress next year.

As we examine issues similar to Staunton's, Floridians should feel lucky that the spirit of our public schools has not been exorcised quite yet. 

The lack of true separation between church and state in parts of the U.S. is atrocious. This reality is grim enough to make any liberal fiercely opposed to reproducing if we're supposed to raise future offspring in a country where students may be damned if they don't follow teachers' orders to pray. 

This debate reveals how divided our country actually is. Do we not live in the United States of America?

Subheadline: America should prepare to see a woman candidate in the next presidential election 
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In four years, America will be in the midst of yet another presidential election. But this time around, something may occur that has never been seen before: two women might be running for president - Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic vote and Condoleeza Rice for the Republican vote.

During the 20th century, women made strides that most thought were not imaginable, mainly because our founding fathers were immigrants and brought with them beliefs that women were inferior to men. In 1920, after many hardships, women finally gained the right to vote, the first step that may one day lead them into the Oval Office. After women gained suffrage, they slowly began to climb the corporate ladder into top business positions - heads of colleges, universities and other elite professions.

It is now time to climb that next mountain. Are women ready to lead what many consider the greatest nation in the world?

According to a recent telephone poll by Hearst Newspapers, the majority of registered voters say that if a woman were to run for president, any woman, chances are they would gain America's vote.

Most voters said their first choice would be Clinton, but  their second would be Rice. If Rice were elected, not only would she be the first woman president, she would also be the first African-American ever to be elected to that office.

 If a woman has the same qualifications as a man, then why can't she run in the presidential election? It is bound to happen. Almost every movie that depicts America's future features an African-American, a Latin-American or a woman as president. If the media is willing to accept the change, then why can't society? Change is inevitable, if not in 2008, then in 2012, but the public should start getting used to the possibility of seeing a woman on their next presidential ballot.

Headline: Softball suffers loss in championship game
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers came into the Golden Panther Adidas Invitational at University Park Campus, Feb. 25. They ranked No. 20 in the country and picked up two one-run victories but, also, a key loss.

FIU failed to pick up its third tournament championship of the season. The Golden Panthers lost the title game and placed second, completing the weekend with a 3-2 record.

"We didn't play overly well," said Head coach Kim Gwydir. "Our offense wasn't there, but our pitching is fine."

After defeating the University of Central Florida 3-2 in eight innings Feb. 25, FIU fell to the Golden Knights 5-1 Feb. 27.

UCF capitalized on three errors committed by FIU, providing for a four-run fourth inning and putting the game out of reach.

The FIU bats were put to rest on Feb. 27, as Kelly McIntyre, who was named the tournament's most valuable player, gave up one run on five hits in a complete-game effort to improve to 6-0 on the year for the Golden Knights (15-8).

FIU's Tiffany Ore suffered her first loss of the season (4-1), as she struck out eight batters in five solid innings of work. The loss dropped the FIU record to 15-5 overall.

Ore pitched a no-hitter through three innings, but gave up back-to-back singles to UCF's Cici Alvarez and Jania Shinhoster to lead off the fourth. 

The two runners later scored following an errant throw on an attempted double-steal and a bunt single by Amber Lamb to give UCF a 2-0 lead. The Golden Knights then added two more runs on two errors from the FIU outfield, scoring Lamb and Crystle Krafft and putting UCF up, 4-0.

UCF added another run in the sixth and sealed the 5-1 victory to win the weekend tournament. Lindsay Tippings, Cassie Parker and Deomni Murray were  named to the all-tournament team for the Golden Panthers.

Feb. 26: FIU 9, FAMU 0

No. 20 FIU bounced back from an earlier 1-0 defeat to Florida A&M in emphatic fashion, crushing the Rattlers, 9-0, in a five-inning mercy-rule contest on Feb. 27. The win improved the Golden Panthers' record to 15-4 and advanced the team to the title game where they took on the UCF team.

Junior Cassie Parker had a big day at the plate, going 4-for-4 in the two games against FAMU (11-13). She knocked in three runs in FIU's semifinal win, hitting a home run, a triple and a base hit.

The pitching staff kept the FAMU bats quiet. FIU Pitchers Kerri Houck (2-2) and Tiffany Ore (4-0) along with Sarah Belanger pitched well in the two games, giving up only one unearned run.

Feb. 25: FIU 2, UConn 1

FIU's freshman Sarah Belanger struck out 11 batters, as she pitched a complete game in her first collegiate start, improving her record to 2-0 after the Golden Panthers defeated Connecticut 2-1.

Michelle Caouette (0-1) struck out five and gave up seven hits and two runs in six innings of work for UConn (1-1).

The Golden Panthers got out on the scoreboard first, as Deomni Murray picked up an infield single, stole second base, advanced to third on Brook Ruiz's single and eventually scored on a wild pitch. The Huskies tied the game in the top of the third, following an RBI triple by Stephanie DiBiase, scoring Jen D'Angelo with one out.

FIU regained the lead in the bottom of the third. The run came on an RBI single from Jennifer Powell, scoring Ruiz and giving the Golden Panthers the 2-1 lead, which the team never surrendered.

Feb. 25: FIU 3, UCF 2 

FIU outlasted the Golden Knights in an eight-inning, afternoon contest. The win improved the Golden Panthers to 14-3 overall, while UCF fell to 12-8.

The teams remained scoreless through seven innings until the international tie-break rules (previous batter placed on second to start the inning) were applied going into the eighth inning.

Then, FIU went ahead 3-0 following a bunt from Lindsay Tippings and a double by Tabitha Embry, which scored Tracey Deleon and Holly Kitchen. Later in the inning, Deomni Murray's bunt single scored Embry from third. It proved to be the game-winning run. 

UCF's Stephanie Best kept the Golden Knights alive by driving a two-run homerun to straight-away center on a 1-2 count with two outs in the bottom of the eighth to put UCF within a run at 3-2. 

But Ore settled down and got Amber Lamb to ground out to end the game.

Headline: Winning streak comes to an end against SJU
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers won two out of three games against the St. John University Red Storm, with wins Feb. 25 and 26 and a loss Feb. 27, at University Park Stadium.

Junior Yahmed Yema went a combined 5-for-11 in the series with three homeruns, four RBI and five runs scored.

"I think we had some good efforts this [series]," said Head coach Danny Price. "[But] I was disappointed with the effort [on Feb. 27]."

FIU 9, St. John 8

In the first game, FIU starting pitcher Ammer Cabrera pitched six solid innings of work, allowed two runs (one unearned) on seven hits, struck out five and walked one batter.

On a 1-0 lead, the Red Storm threatened again in the fourth inning with the bases loaded and nobody out. However, Cabrera  worked his way out of the jam by forcing SJU to ground into the inning-ending double play.

FIU got on the board in the bottom of the fourth off a Jacobs ground ball that took a weird hop. This caused SJU's first baseman to fall down and allowed senior Jeff Skellenger to score easily from second. Freshman Michael Jordan then doubled to right-center field that scored Jacobs. Jordan eventually came around to score from second off an SJU error to take a 3-1 lead.

FIU eventually scored four more runs for a seemingly insurmountable 7-3 lead after the end of the seventh inning. 

An SJU threat against reliever Matt Rainey forced coach Price to bring in closer Danny "The Vulture" Hernandez with one out in the eighth. But by the time the eighth inning had ended, the Red Storm had pulled within one run. 

FIU then took an 8-6 lead into the ninth inning, but SJU mounted a two-out, mini-rally to tie the game at eight. Then, junior reliever Frank "The Tank" Gonzalez came into the game with runners at the corners and struck out an SJU batter for the third out, ending the threat.

The winning run came off the legs of speedster Chris Dunn who, after getting on base with a single, proceeded to steal second and third base. Freshman James McOwen brought Dunn home on an infield single that ricocheted off the legs of SJU's hard throwing, first-round MLB prospect pitcher Craig Hansen.

"You just hit that plate, and the adrenaline's just pumping. It's an awesome feeling," said Dunn. "[McOwen] is just a freshman, but he's one of the best hitters on the team. I knew with a ground ball I'd score." 

Gonzalez was credited with the win, despite throwing only five pitches and facing one batter.

"I found my slider today so I threw five in a row," said Gonzalez. "It feels good to get the win, but embarrassing at the same time. Ammer threw 93 quality pitches, and he deserved to get the win."

FIU 11, St. John 4

In game one, senior David Asher snapped his streak after allowing his first earned run in 30 innings pitched this season. For the game, the lefty pitched eight innings, allowed four runs on eight hits and struck out six batters to earn his fourth win of the season.

"It was bound to happen. It was a nice streak to have," Asher said. "Having my team hit and keeping them in the game-that's the big thing I care about, as long as we win."

Senior Dennis Diaz went 2-for-4 with a homerun, four RBIs and two runs scored. FIU jumped to a 6-0 advantage in the third inning, setting the tone for the rest of the game. 

Diaz started things by hitting a two-run homerun to left-center. McOwen then scored on a passed ball when the bases were loaded. Then, Cody Jacobs cleared the bags with his fourth homerun of the season.

SJU finally tagged Asher and scored two runs off him in the top of the fifth inning to make it 6-2. 

The Red Storm came as close as 7-4, but not before having FIU reply with four runs in the bottom of the eighth.

Gonzalez came in relief of Asher to pitch the ninth inning, allowed no hits and struck out a batter.

FIU 4, St. John 9

In the final game of the series, five FIU errors led to the end of their seven-game winning streak. The loss also means the team must go clean shaven. Coach Price, who has long had a policy allowing no facial hair, told his players he'd let them grow facial hair as they pleased, as long as they kept winning.

"Losing is all part of it, but I feel we needed a better effort [in this game]," said coach Price. "When you make five errors, it's gonna be really hard to win ball games, especially against good teams like St. John's."

Freshman starting pitcher Elih Villanueva went four innings, allowed four runs (only one of them earned) on six hits, walked two and struck out only one.

FIU first got on the board in the second inning off a solo homerun by Yema, which tied the game at one.

SJU took a 4-1 lead before the Golden Panthers came back to again tie the game at four after the fifth inning. However, that would be the last time we saw the FIU bats in the game as the Red Storm scored five unanswered runs in the final three innings.

SJU's Hansen made up for his losing performance two days before by earning the save in front of about a dozen Major League scouts.

FIU pitcher Rainey was saddled with his second loss of the season. He pitched three innings, allowed two runs (one earned) on two hits, walked three and struck out two.

The Golden Panthers continue their long home-stand March 4 at 7 p.m. against Temple University.

FIU 79 WESTERN, KENTUCKY 77

During a season full of ups and mostly downs, the Golden Panthers got their second big shocker of the season Feb. 26 at Pharmed Arena. 

The Hilltoppers came into the match-up with the Golden Panthers after winning eight of their last nine to clinch their 35th 20-win season in school history.

FIU came into the game winners of three of their last six, including two straight at home. 

With 1.13 left to play in the game, Ivan Almonte took the ball in the post from Antonio Jones and converted the play while getting fouled. He then missed the ensuing free throw. N'Diaye rebounded the miss and put it in, giving the Golden Panthers the 75-74 lead. 

On the following possession, the Hilltoppers turned the ball over and N'Diaye dove to recover the loose ball and call a timeout with 51.2 left to play. 

The Golden Panthers moved the ball down the court and hit Almonte in the post. He faked the shot and found senior Byron Burnett wide open under the basket for an easy one handed dunk that put FIU up by three with just over 20 seconds to play. 

Following a three-point miss by Antonio Haynes, Warren Gale rebounded the ball and was fouled with 10.5 left. He made both his free throws to give FIU a five-point lead. 

Anthony Winchester was then fouled, and he converted one of two from the stripe. The rebound came down, and a jump ball was called as Almonte and Lee scrambled for the ball. 

With 2.2 left, the Hilltoppers, who had the possession arrow, in-bounded the ball and converted from the field. 

It was too much too late, as the Golden Panthers sealed their third straight win at home and their fourth overall in the conference. 

The Golden Panthers trailed for most of the second half, and it looked as though they were just going to let the game slip out of reach. The Hilltoppers went on an 8-0 run, forcing the Golden Panthers into a timeout with 4.30 left to play, trailing by nine. 

"Our kids played hard all night," said Head coach Sergio Rouco. "We fell behind a bunch of times, but we just kept playing. This is a team that hasn't buckled all year long. This is our third-straight home win, and we're beginning to play well at the right time of the year."

Freshman Courtney Lee,who scored eight points in the opening half, came out after the break on fire, hitting two quick three-pointers that gave the Hilltoppers an eight point lead, 44-36, and forced Rouco to call a quick timeout. 

 The Golden Panthers shot themselves in the foot as they headed into half time trailing by two, 36-34, as they shot a miserable 2-8 from the free throw line.

Western Kentucky's leading point scorer on the season, junior Anthony Winchester, who averages 18.2 points per game and leads the Sun Belt Conference in three-point shooting percentage, was once again off to his regular self, finishing the first half 1-1 from the floor and 4-4 from the stripe for six points. 

"We handled their pressure in the second half and we did a great job of stopping their 3-point shooters," Rouco said. "Last time we met, we made them shoot threes and they made them. In this game, we made them shoot lay-ups and took away their threes and it worked for us."

Almonte once again led the Golden Panthers, scoring 12 of FIU's 34 points on 6-7 shooting in the first half. 

Ismael N'Diaye, who struggled in the previous loss at New Orleans, could not find his touch in the first half, finishing the opening half just 3-9 from the floor for eight points. 

"Most of our games we are down by eight,'' said N'Diaye. ``We're used to it. We play hard, come back and that's what we did tonight.''

N'Diaye's three biggest points came at the end of the half. With FIU trailing by 5, 36-31, N'Diaye took the ball on the left baseline and put up a perfect shot that tickled the twine as the clock expired. 

Junior Matias, who started the night 24 points short of becoming the third FIU player to notch 300 points this season [Almonte, N'Diaye], was limited to just eight minutes in the first half as he picked up three quick fouls. 

MIDDLE TENNESSEE 91, FIU 81

Senior Night wasn't quite what the FIU faithful would have liked. 

The Golden Panthers fell in their final regular season home game, March 1, to Middle Tennessee State 91-81.  

Despite a 13-6 run over the first four minutes of the half, the Golden Panthers could not get within less than six points of the lead and consequently, never led in their final regular season home game. 

Almonte, who struggled all night, came alive in the final six minutes of regulation, scoring 17 of FIU's final 27 points to lead all scorers with 21 points. His numbers on paper far out-class the way he played on the court. 

For the second game in a row, he fell short of a double-double with eight rebounds, bringing his season average just percentage points under a double-double a game. 

Middle Tennessee was led by five players in double figures, including 20 from junior Fats Cuyler and 19 from senior Michael Cuffee. 

Seniors Junior Matias, Byron Burnett and Warren Gale all started their final game at Pharmed Arena. 

FIU, still hungover from their victory against Western Kentucky, came out flat in the first half. Over the first 10 minutes of play, the Golden Panthers managed to shoot just 3-of-14 from the field and found themselves down 12, 18-6, before Matias made two free throws to cut the Blue Raiders lead to 10. 

"We laid an egg tonight," said Head coach Sergio Rouco. "We beat Western Kentucky last Saturday and forgot we've only got 11 wins this season. There was no bright side to this game and I'm disappointed." 

Almonte and N'Diaye started the game 2-of-9 combined for a squad that looked completely flat with 8.30 to play in the first period.

They say that when it rains it pours. During the first half of Monday night's game against Middle Tennessee, it rained on the Golden Panthers senior night; it rained threes. 

FIU was led by seniors Burnett and Matias at the half, each with eight points, including 4-of-4 shooting from the 6'8 center, despite starting the game by acquiring two quick fouls. In spite of Burnett's unusual output, the teams poor shooting had them trailing by 13, 43-30 at the break. 

Almonte, who was averaging nearly 18 points per game, was held in check by the best defensive team in the conference and managed just four points. 

Almonte and N'Diaye's shooting did not improve over the course of the last 10 minutes of the first half and the tandem finished 4-15 with just eight points between them. 

The story of the first half, apart from the Golden Panthers poor shooting, was the play of Blue Raider Michael Cuffee, who shot 3-4 from behind the arc and went into the locker room leading all scorers with 11 points. 

FIU will now face South Alabama  March 4 at 2:30 p.m. in the opening round of the Sun Belt Conference in Denton, TX at the campus of North Texas. 

The Golden Panthers won the only meeting between the two teams this season on Feb. 19, a 74-71 road victory.

Headline: Power Trip at the Office of Parking and Traffic
Subheadline:  
Author: AValc002@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
At some point last week, FIU¡¯s Parking and Traffic office decided to close off Parking Lot #6 to non-resident students.  The only warning we got was a citation on our windshields and, in at least one case, a boot on our wheels.  What no email?

From the business perspective, I find developing a Parking and Traffic office on campus a very profitable form of income for the university.  But as a student I¡¯d like to express my outrage to the fact that we don¡¯t work our part-time or full-time jobs to pay for the likes of a power-tripping rent-a-cop department.  At the rate we get ticketed why does the university even charge a parking fee through our tuition?  On top of the fact that they give citations away like candy, we, as their customers, still have to cover their ass financially with a continuously rising tuition rate that is increasing too fast for comfort. Tuition rates that are probably the direct results of  irresponsible decisions that end up in $11.5 Million settlements with the Federal Government (as reported by The Beacon in their February 21st issue).  The result: our parking fee will probably go up!  Their justification: New parking facilities(duh!).

Back to Parking Lot #6, it is imperative that this lot not be closed off to enrolled students that do not live on campus.  We all know that both the Gold and Blue garages are packed by 10:00 AM and the main lot East of GC is almost always filled to capacity practically all day.  To put it all into perspective, when the fair opens later this month, Parking Lot #6 and #5, and the grass behind Parking Lot #6 will all be off limits to us, the students.  Yeah, it¡¯s nice that we have two more parking garages on campus, and they real pretty don't get me wrong, but to put it lightly¡­ THEY¡¯RE IN THE BOONDOCKS!  In addition to this, Parking and Traffic has allowed the fair to post signs that now read, ¡°ADDITIONAL PARKING¡± at lot #6.  My question is, where does that leave me?  Are fair guests permitted to park in the new ¡°Residential Parking Lot¡± and students can go f*ck themselves?  I don¡¯t know about anybody else, but I¡¯m sure as hell getting that vibe!  

Most students would argue (as would I) that they did not see the newly posted signs at the entrance to Lot #6 and were surprised (shocked, angered, enraged (that¡¯s me!), or disgruntled) to come out of class that week to find a citation plastered to their windshield.  Parking and Traffic will probably say to you, ¡°The signs were clear and completely visible!¡±  I don¡¯t know about anybody else, but after attending FIU for almost four years, you come to get used to some things.  Like driving confidently into a parking lot that has always been accessible to you.  This ritual, in most cases, does not trigger your mind to look out for drastic changes like these over night.  In addition to this, campus residents were the only ones to receive emails about the parking changes.  What about the rest of us?  It seems that we commuters come in only second to university on-campus residents... maybe even third after the fair's guests who are now allowed this ¡°ADDITIONAL PARKING.¡± 

As a future alumnus of FIU, few things will give me more joy than to help my alma mater prosper and grow to be the best university in Florida.  But let¡¯s hope the university learns to listen to our concerns.  And STUDENTS, let¡¯s show a little more interest in the direction of our university's policies.  Let your voice be heard.  Below are the names, emails, and fax numbers of the Parking and Traffic Office at the University Park Campus.  Disgruntled?  Take a minute and let them know.  God Bless!
