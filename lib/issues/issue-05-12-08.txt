Headline: Football team releases 2006 season schedule
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Fresh off of finishing the season with three-consecutive wins, the football team announced its schedule for the 2006 season Dec. 6.

The 12-game schedule feature matches against opponents from top Division I-A conferences such as the ACC, SEC, MAC and the Big East, as well as a full slate of Sun Belt Conference match ups. 

"Our schedule is very ambitious, but is designed to create interest as we build our fan base, provide national and community exposure and pave the way for present and future marquis home match ups," said Athletic Director Rick Mello.

One of those marquis home match ups is the Golden Panthers' 2006 home opener Sept. 16 against Bowling Green. The remainder of their five homes games will be against the 2005 Sun Belt Conference Champions Arkansas State (Sept. 30), as well as conference foes Louisiana-Monroe (Nov. 4), Louisiana-Lafayette (Nov. 18) and Troy (Dec. 2).

The seven road games on the schedule kick off with the season opener Sept. 9 against South Florida at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. FIU will then travel to the famed College Park Sept. 23 to take on ACC member Maryland.

FIU will continue on the road for the entire month of October with arguably the toughest month of games in the program's young history against Middle Tennessee State (Oct. 7), national powerhouse and cross-town rival Miami (Oct. 14), former SBC champions North Texas (Oct. 21) and SEC powerhouse Alabama (Oct. 28).

"We will continue to work as hard as we can to schedule non-conference games with local emphasis like five (time) national champion Miami, South Florida and Alabama, which will associate our program with the tremendous impact the Shula family has had on football in South Florida," Mello said. "The schedule has been well received by our student-athletes and recruits and we very much look forward to the 2006 season."

After eight consecutive weeks of football, the Golden Panthers will have their first bye week of the season Nov. 11 and will close out the month of November at Florida Atlantic for the fifth annual Shula Bowl.

The Golden Panthers, who finished in a tie for second place in the Sun Belt Conference, have concluded their two-year probationary period in Division I-A and will, therefore, be eligible for bowl games in 2006.

"We've joined the Sun Belt Conference and are moving forward as a program who wants to play the best. Next year's schedule reflects that," said head coach Don Strock. "We're playing South Florida, who had a tremendous year in 2005; Bowling Green, who is always in the hunt in the MAC; the University of Maryland from the ACC; our next-door neighbors from the University of Miami and the University of Alabama. 

"They will all be big tests for this program. Our players, when they first got here, said that this is the kind of schedule they wanted to play. Now, we're going to see how they handle it."

Headline: Current Marlins going on same path as '97 team
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Winter meetings haven't even begun and the trade winds in South Florida are already blowing harder than Hurricane Wilma did.

Less than two months removed from the 2005 regular season, the desperate Florida Marlins have given away half of last season's opening day lineup including Paul lo Duca, Carlos Delgado, Luis Castillo, Mike Lowell and Josh Beckett. 

A.J. Burnett has signed a free agent contract with the Toronto Blue Jays and Juan Pierre is prone to be traded.

The carousel has worked its way back around as the Marlins go through another break-up of a great team. 

The trend is: The Marlins win a World Series, then nobody shows up for games, so they trade away all the players for minor-league prospects, build them up into studs and then they sign somewhere else.  Just call it the National League farm system.

Sure it's easy to point the finger at management for not being able to keep their players, but that would be as idiotic as building a baseball team in South Florida. The fault for the recurring state of the Marlins can be found within ourselves.

After the 1997 Marlins won their first World Series, the money-hungry Wayne Huizenga dismantled the team without even giving it a chance to draw revenue. 

Mourning over the $31 million dollars he lost the previous season, Huizenga demised the championship ball club and put together a defending champion minor-league team in 1998. 

That time the Marlins were to blame. 

Not this year. 

Jeffrey Loria squeezed all he could out of the battered orange that is the Marlins payroll and tried to make this team a competitor as long as possible. 

There was nothing left to do and that's because Florida baseball fans never showed any interest in rooting for the team unless they were playing in October.

There's no other explanation for it. In their first 10 seasons, the Marlins accomplished what no South Florida franchise has accomplished in over 40 years:  two championships.  

With low budgets, an empty  stadium - made for football - and a Tallahassee legislature breathing down their necks, the Marlins' organization has miraculously found more success than most teams in the Major Leagues today.

Too bad they played in the wrong city,  the city of excuses. Whether it was that the stadium was too far, the games were during the week or the ballpark was not made for baseball, Miami fans dig up all the excuses they can muster to avoid seeing their team play.

We deserve all this to happen. We deserve for every significant player on that team to be traded to NL East rivals. We deserve for the Florida Marlins to become the Nevada Mirages and play their home games in the strip between Wayne Newton concerts and Bernard Hopkins fights.

We were given all the chances in the world and we couldn't respond. Quite frankly, I guess  we didn't care enough.

Headline: ENDING ON HIGH NOTE
Subheadline: Strock and his team finish season with three straight wins
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It went down to the wire but the Golden Panthers ended their first full Division I-A campaign in winning fashion. 

The Golden Panthers (5-6, 3-4 SBC) defeated the visiting Blue Raiders of Middle Tennessee (4-7, 3-4 SBC) 35-31, Dec. 3, to finish their first Sun Belt season in a tie for second place. 

"I am especially proud of the seniors," said head coach Don Strock, following the win. "I talked to them today, especially the ones that were here for the practice year, the first year [players] that believed we would be here today. 

"There is something about this group, their light came on. The freshmen played outstanding."

The win, which marked the first three-game winning streak in program history and tied the record of the 2002 inaugural team for the best record, was also a record setting one for three FIU standouts. 

Senior Cory McKinney became the only Golden Panther to catch a pass in every FIU game, a mark that spanned 44 outings. Juniors Chandler Williams and Keyonvis Bouie also set marks in the win. 

Williams, FIU's leading receiver this season, broke McKinney's record set in 2004 for 58 catches in a season by catching eight passes for a career-high 160 yards, bringing his season total to a new team record of 61. 

Bouie, the Golden Panthers lead linebacker, who against Florida Atlantic last week had become only the second FIU player to make 100 tackles in a season, had 18 in the win which brought his total to 118 on the season, breaking John Haritan's team record of 117 set in 2003, despite missing two games earlier this year. 

A freshman however, was the one that grabbed the most important headline on this night. 

A'mod Ned's 20-yard touchdown run, with 1:19 left to play, gave the Golden Panthers the win in a contest that saw them come from behind only to lose the lead with three minutes left in the contest and then have to recapture it. 

Middle Tennessee, led by quarterback Clint Marks, took their first drive of the game 80 yards for a quick lead and put any thoughts of a remake of the FAU win out of the question. 

The Blue Raiders took a 7-0 lead on a flea flicker as Marks tossed to tailback Eugene Moss, who then threw the ball back to the signal caller, who scampered into the end zone from 19 yards out. 

FIU got a chance to pull three points back on their first possession of the game but kicker Adam Moss missed just his second field goal of the season from 37 yards away in a game he will soon long to forget. 

With 11 seconds left to play in the quarter, coach Andy McCollum, in his final game in charge of the MTSU program, called for Marks to pass down field. He found a streaking Cleannord Saintil for a 41-yard score and a 14-0 lead. 

"My biggest concern, after the FAU game," admitted Strock, "[was that] everyone is patting you on the back, until you have to go out and do it again. You get a little complacent. When we came out the defense was a little complacent; we had a few words and we got that straightened out in a hurry."

The second quarter saw the hangover disappear for FIU as quarterback Josh Padrick found his touch and then found Cory McKinney for a 17-yard touchdown. 

The drive was highlighted by a Ben West run that spanned 26 yards before being hit out-of-bounds for an extra 15-yard penalty. On the following play from the MTSU 17-yard line, FIU would get on the board. 

The comeback was complete on the next possession as FIU's defense stepped up and special teams blocked a punt before A'mod Ned tied the game with an 18-yard touchdown run. 

Following a three-and-out by what had appeared to be a sluggish defense in the first quarter, Antwan Barnes stepped up and blocked a Blue Raider punt, giving the FIU offense the ball at the 25-yard line. Following a completion by Padrick, Ned found a gap and tied the game at 14. 

Following another miss from Moss, this time from 41 yards with 6:49 left in the half, the turnaround was complete as FIU would score their third touchdown of the quarter, when Padrick connected with McKinney again, from 16 yards away, capping off a six play 66 yard drive that took 2:28 off the clock. 

Middle Tennessee would pull within four points, as time expired in the first half, 21-17, after kicker Colby Smith connected from 27 yards to end the Golden Panther run. 

The shootout would continue in the second half as McCullum's team would come out of the locker room with nothing to lose. 

Their defense held FIU in check and the offense came alive as Marks drove them 65 yards down the field on nine plays and scored himself on a six yard keeper on second-and-goal to put the visitors back ahead 24-21. 

Padrick would answer the call on the following drive as the Blue Raiders were plagued with four personal foul penalties which gave the Golden Panthers a small field to work with. Padrick's duel with Marks continued as he kept the ball and scored from one-yard away to send the student section into a frenzy with the 28-24 lead. 

Kicker Colby Smith would have a chance to bring MTSU within one point, but failed to convert from 37 yards heading into the fourth quarter. 

Middle Tennessee would take their final lead of the contest with 5:17 to play. 

A nine-play, 42-yard drive which included two fourth down conversions, was capped off when Marks found Stephen Chicola from two yards out for his first career touchdown and a 31-28 lead. 

Luckily for FIU, there was plenty of time left on the clock. 

Disaster struck however, on the following possession as Padrick threw his second interception. Brandley Robinson ripped the ball out of FIU wide out Andre Rollins' hands at the two-yard line, giving the Blue Raiders a chance to end the game by picking up a first down from their own two with 3:01 left in the season. 

The FIU defense, led by Bouie with only two timeouts left, stepped up and met the challenge forcing a three-and-out to give the offense one final chance. 

Following the punt, FIU began their last possession of the night at the MTSU 48-yard line; it would take them just three plays to come away victorious.

Following passes of eight and 20 yards to Williams and Moses Hinton, Ned took the ball from the Middle Tennessee 20-yard line and scampered into the end zone to put the hosts up 35-31 with 1:19 left to play. 

With seven seconds left, Marks would heave the ball into the end zone only to be broken up by two Golden Panthers, ending the season on a high note.

Ape cognitive skills researched at zoo

Keo, a 47-year-old male chimpanzee is part of a cognitive skills research at Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo. 

Supervisor of behavioral and cognitive research Steve Ross and his colleagues are conducting research to "talk to animals."

The research consists of getting apes to use touch screen computers in order to communicate preferences such as food, activity and living space. 

The research has shown that Keo gets annoyed when his keepers are delayed in the morning. 

Although Keo cannot read time, he is aware of time and he is the first ape to be trained while using a screen. 

Two other apes named Vicky and Rollie are also taking part in the research. 

"It is totally voluntary on their part. We invite them to try out the screen. If they don't want to participate, we accept their decision," said Ross.

This type of research is normally done in universities, and now,  American zoos are hiring their own scientists to do research within the zoo.

Headline: Controversy expected at intelligent design debate
Author: Eddith Sevilla / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The floor may get heated when an evangelical Christian and an Orthodox Jew debate intelligent design at the Sixth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, to be held at the Kovens Conference Center at the Biscayne Bay Campus beginning Dec. 13 at 8 p.m. and continuing through Dec. 15.

William A. Dembski, a professor of science and theology at Southern Theological Seminary and considered the most eloquent advocate of intelligent design, along with Orthodox Jewish thinkers including Rabbi Moshe D. Tendler, a noted ethicist and biology professor at Yeshiva University in New York, Herman Branover of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar of The Shul in Surfside and Eduardo Zeigler, professor of biology at UCLA will discuss, "How Should We Teach the Origin and Diversity of Species?" 

"This is an important and interesting topic for our culture because it brings theology, science and education together when usually they are not," said Nathan Katz, professor of religious studies at FIU and one of the event organizers.

"Intelligent design holds that by carefully observing natural phenomena, one can infer an intelligent underlying nature. Intelligent design has been proposed as a way of reconciling the evolution vs. creationism controversy," Katz said. 

However, some of the Orthodox Jewish scientists who will be presenting evidence opposing the evolutionary theory, disagree in terms of including the intelligent design in science courses at Jewish high schools. 

Professor Eduardo Zeiger believes that Jews do not need intelligent design and that the public debate on intelligent design needs to be refined. 

The idea of having speakers on both sides of the issue may be the perfect ingredient for a heated debate, according to Katz.

"I'm expecting some airing of a controversial topic. The key note speaker is a devoted evangelical Christian and this is the first time, to my knowledge, that this topic is discussed between an evangelical Christian and Orthodox Jews," Katz said. 

Some students, like Frank Gomez, said that intelligent design and religions are two separate spheres. 

"Intelligent design, in my opinion, is inclusive of pretty much all religions, meaning that it does not promote the establishment of a religion, which is what the Constitution defines as separation of the church and state," said Gomez, who is majoring in broadcast journalism. "There are no constitutional or scientific grounds to keep intelligent design out of schools." 

However, the conference is not limited to the debate. 

Lectures will be included with topics such as: the way in which Judaic Law would have ruled on the Terry Schiavo case; Kabbalistic writings on the historic progression of the feminine movement from diminishment to full stature; and how evolution should be taught in schools.

Headline: College created to merge arts
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A new College of Arts and Architecture is expected to be inaugurated in late January or early February 2006 and will include four units: the School of Architecture, the School of Music, a new School of Art and Art History and a new School of Theatre, Dance and Speech Communication. Additionally, the Patricia and Philip Frost Art Museum will also be located within this new college. 

"The decision follows a multi-year set of faculty based discussions," said former Provost Mark D. Rosenberg through a press release. "The vision of this new unit is to achieve excellence in the fine arts."

The decision to accept the presented proposal was made by Rosenberg in concurrence with University President Modesto Maidique and current Provost Ronald Berkman.

"This re-organization has been under consideration for about two years now," said Juan Antonio Bueno, dean of the School of Architecture. "The purpose behind the creation of this new college is to strengthen the education of students and also enhance our standing in the arts and design communities."

According to Bueno, another reason for the merge was that many departments were reporting to the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. 

"There is hardly any focus on departments in the arts," Bueno said. "However, if you have a dean concentrated in the arts, he can take care of the work which he has expertise in."

Mark D. Szuchman, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences agrees. 

"It becomes progressively hard to be worked by a single office. Arts and architecture is a small unit looking for a curricular innovation in terms of greater progress and efficiency. 

"The creation of a new college is meant to improve the organizational process for better design and to blend together disciplines that are similar," Szuchman said.

With the inauguration of the new College of Arts and Architecture, Bueno will assume the position of founding dean while Szuchman will become executive dean of the college on an interim basis. 

"I feel very fortunate, challenged but most of all very excited about it," Bueno said.

Bueno said it was too early to discuss curriculum changes; however, there have been committees addressing these issues and he was almost certain that there will be some changes. 

Carol Damian, chair of the art and art history department, hopes that in a smaller school in which there is an understanding of what the arts are and what they represent, the department and its students will be able to receive long-overdue attention. 

"We will have a closer relationship with other departments in the art; we can share problems and accomplishments and work on tenure promotion issues," Damian said. "It is these areas where we haven't been seen as a priority." 

These sentiments are shared by Leroy Clark, chair of the department of theatre, dance and speech communication. 

"For many years we haven't been recognized or seen as important," Clark said.

Clark believes that faculty and staff of the arts aren't properly represented and that although the value of work in other departments is recognized, there isn't much recognition for the arts.

"They don't know how to evaluate the work. The people who are experienced in art and architecture should be the ones responsible for evaluating the work of their peers," Clark said.

"With the new college, our budget won't be increasing but we will have more control over it," Damian added. "There will be more open opportunities, options and a clear picture to look out for better ways to utilize our budget."

Along with the new college, a development officer will be hired to look for opportunities in the arts for students.

"If we had the attention of the development office that the engineering, business, or law schools receive, then we would have had plenty of support from the community," Damian said.

Headline: Students to visit orphan children in Ecuador
Author: Begone Cazalis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Ever since she can remember, Marianna has been living with her brother at the orphanage Albergue Padre Julio Villaroel Ocana in Loja, Ecuador. Each morning she wakes up and makes her bed; she knows her daily responsibilities well. She puts on the only clothes she owns and puts away her pajamas inside her own little locker, the single thing she does not have to share among the other 200 kids at her orphanage. 

"She is a very special girl," said Samira Sami, project Loja founder who will be traveling for nine hours to the village of Loja to take medications and goods for the children of the orphanage as program founder for Project Loja.

This month, four FIU students are joining the project for the first time and will be giving up their winter break to help these kids.

"Other kids who are not orphans also attend and live at The Albergue because they usually live too far away or in very bad conditions, Sami said. "Christmas is coming and most of the kids who do have parents will return to their families to celebrate the holidays."

Like every year, this little girl will stay with the other orphans and the priest and nuns who run The Albergue. 

At least the orphans have someone to wait for: the Loja volunteers who have been bringing Christmas to them for the past two years. 

The volunteer program in Loja started in the summer of 2003 when Sami, a student from the University of Miami and her brother became aware of what was needed at the orphanage and the surrounding villages. 

Today, Project Loja is an organization that provides these children with indispensable goods like medications, hygiene products and school supplies every year. 

The eight volunteers will be helping from Dec. 21 until Jan. 5. Each of them is allowed to take 140 pounds of luggage and in place of their belongings, they will take with them the items they collect, said Danny Louis, one of the students who will be visiting Loja during the break. 

Monetary donations are being accepted at www.projectloja.org to purchase goods, and medications are also being donated by different pediatricians and organizations.

 "I think I am fortunate enough to be able to take this trip. Not everybody is. They have families that they have to be there for. But anyone could still help these kids by contributing in many ways," said Louis, a senior majoring in philosophy.

The volunteers will be staying at the orphanage, which is also a school during the school season. This year, they will also visit nearby villages where there are many diseases caused by contaminated water and the impoverished conditions of where the orphans live. 

For 14 days, the students will be involved in much more than just distributing the donations. They will be teaching the kids English, creating arts and crafts and organizing different activities like games and trips to the mountains. 

"The idea of the project is not only to fulfill some basic needs, but also to create an impact in these kids' lives," said Martin Lopez, a student majoring in philosophy and member of Project Loja.

"The things that we are taking them is part of showing them that we love them, but there is also a lot we will accomplish by showing them our care and our love, and that we are here for them," Lopez said.

For many in the United States, the holidays are a time for helping those in need and being with family, but it is also a time  "when the orphanage is visited the least, and when the children appreciate it the most," according to the project Loja website.

All four students agreed that there are many benefits for them in taking this trip, and not just the service they would provide to the community of Loja. 

Gustavo Sirit, a student majoring in philosophy and mathematics understands the need for facing this world's reality.

 "It is important to leave our comfortable situations and become aware of the urgent conditions in which most of the population of the world is living," Sirit said.

During the visit they will create a greater communication between organizations in Miami and organizations in Loja, permitting the development of future projects, according to the Project Loja website.

Juan Sanchez, another volunteer who is majoring in religious studies and philosophy, said he would like to be part of the future project.

"I wouldn't like this to be an isolated experience. I think I would like to go back, because I am interested in Latin America and I want to get closer to it," Sanchez said.

Samira knows that Marianna and the other kids are waiting for their return this December. Not only because they are bringing basic-need items, but also because of the bond they have created with the kids. 

"It's not only about poverty; they are persons who we want to create a connection with," Sanchez said.

Headline: Professor designs Miami monument
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Between establishing himself in  Miami, enduring hurricanes and most recently, winning first place in an international architecture competition, it has been an eventful first semester at FIU for Roberto Rovira.

"This is a wonderful surprise, and I'm ecstatic," Rovira said of his victory.

Rovira, an assistant professor  in the School of Architecture's Landscape Architecture Program, won a $1500 first-place prize for his entry in the Miami Monument competition, an international competition in which architects worldwide design a distinctive monument that would represent Miami. 

"One of the parameters was that it wanted to capture the spirit of Miami, and what does Miami mean to the world?" Rovira said.

The goal of the competition was to "invite dialogue about possible ideas to transform the Miami Skyline and give it an identifying marker, much like The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, or the St. Louis Arch," Rovira explained.  "Even though there's a lot of construction going on in Miami, there really isn't an element that is identified with Miami." 

Rovira's entry, which he dubbed "The Miami Sunspars," was designed to represent Miami's resiliency and ability to change.

"Being a relative newcomer to Miami, it struck me from the very beginning that this was a place that symbolized or embodied or thrived on change," Rovira said. "No matter what the odds, no matter how many hurricanes hit us, there's this ability to spring back and reinvent itself."

Conceptualizing the tension between the ideas of permanence and constant change provided a rich challenge to Rovira.  

"I think that the idea of a monument is perhaps interpreted as a more static element in a landscape, but Miami, in my view, embodies something that is innately transformative in nature. It's hard to define and hard to pin down," Rovira said.

The Miami Sunspars consists of three solar-power towers that could convert into bridges and connect different parts of Miami which are divided by water. 

In case of either an emergency or a prominent civic event, it allowed pedestrians to walk from one point to another.  

The towers would also allow for people to enter and ride a series of elevators to the top while vertical.  

"Because they were solar-powered, they would be self-sustaining," Rovira said. "Because of their magnitude, they would also have extra energy to contribute to the [power] grid." 

The solar energy would also power a media bar that would provide a wide variety of information, such as weather and important announcements.

The concept and form of the towers was also inspired by the leaves of a palm frond, "a very efficient processor of energy."  

It absorbs energy from the sun, and transforms it into nutrients and oxygen for other living beings too.  

So it seemed perfectly fitting that Miami is "a place where all this energy comes together and gives it back tenfold," Rovira said.

Rovira began teaching at FIU in the Fall  semester of 2005, "right in time for hurricane season," as he put it.  

Rovira received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University, and a master's in landscape architecture from Rhode Island School of Design. In between, he served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy for four years.  

He came to Miami from San Francisco after being offered a teaching position in FIU's landscape architecture program.

"I think that being a new transplant to Miami, I couldn't think of a better way to kick it off," Roivra said.  "I hope that it provides something to inspire people."

Headline: Narnia movie captures magic
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Director Andrew Adamson (of the Shrek movies fame) had a heavy task ahead of him when he decided to take on the big screen adaptation of C. S. Lewis' "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," the first in his "Chronicles of Narnia" series. Not only have the beloved books sold more than 10 million copies since they were published, but three other versions have been made, all of them for television.

However, from the first thrilling minutes set in World War II England to the last comic second of the movie, the new adaptation shows that Adamson has both managed to take and surpass the expectations laid on him by Narnia fans across the world.

Lewis' story of four war-evacuated children who must save a mythical land from the witch who has turned it into a frozen wasteland finds new life under the kiwi director's hands, as the short children's book is fleshed out to reach epic proportions. 

The landscapes of such locations as New Zealand and the Czech Republic are used with magical results, with scenes that seem to pop out of the screen. A chase through an icy river is especially powerful and the last battle sequence (though not as vast as those seen in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy) was still good enough to elicit gasps from the audience.

The greatest gem of the movie, though, is the superb acting given by the cast. The children actors selected to play the title roles manage to actually act like real kids, bickering and annoying each other as real siblings would do. William Moseley as older and commanding brother Peter is a great foil to Skandar Keynes' nebbish traitor Edmund, while Anna Popplewell perfectly plays the part of the more rational and peace-keeping Susan. Still, it is nine-year-old Georgie Henley who best rounds up the quartet as the young sister who first stumbles into Narnia through the back of a  wardrobe - her large eyes and toothy smile constantly help to express the awe and fear the adventures bring.

Ray Winstone and Dawn French also provide great comic relief as they voice a pair of bickering yet helpful beavers (seamlessly animated by Weta, the same company that made the special effects for Jackson's movies) and James McAvoy shines as the conflicted half goat, half man Mr. Tumnus, Lucy's first Narnian friend.

The choice of Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan (the revered lion who must pay a costly price to save his land) still comes into question, his soothing voice sometimes too passive and not as cheerful as described in the original works.

Also, though actress Tilda Swinton fully immerses herself into the role of the White Witch, appearing as though she herself were made of ice, she is not allotted enough time to delve into why her character is so bad.

Even though both the great villain and hero of the novel are somewhat abridged in the movie, Adamson (who also co-wrote the script) still keeps almost all of the elements in the books, adding some extra scenes to develop the children's personalities without deterring from the written plot.

Many who watch the movie (be it long-time fans, those in search of the Christian message Lewis weaved into his tale or just anyone wanting a good time) will probably leave theatres with the same faces the children show upon first entering the white landscape beyond the wardrobe doors: wide-eyed and stunned, unable to believe that something so magical could ever exist.

Headline: Haitian chef hosts Caribbean Food Makeover
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Easy-Mac, cold pizza, Coke and late night dashes to Denny's are often all that make up some housing resident's diets. 

The freshman 15, the bane of every new college student's existence is weight gained due to the amount of junk food students eat.

The Wellness Center at the Biscayne Bay Campus decided to do something about the food situation and sponsored the Caribbean Food Makeover, a workshop designed to teach students good eating habits as well as some new tasty recipes. 

The event took place Dec. 2 and focused on Caribbean dishes.

Chef Ketly Pierre, who hails from Haiti and is renown for her delectable international cuisine and pastries, gave the session in the instructional kitchen of the School of Hospitality and Management.

In a matter of hours, Pierre showed the group how to make angel hair pasta out of Ramen noodles, ground beef with the same Ramen spices, curry shrimp, rice and peas and a variety of vegetables.  

"I want students to get off of pizza. Anyone can get all of the food I just cooked for under $50," Pierre said.

She also gave tips on how to keep the same taste, while marinating food in its own juices, such as when cooking meat or vegetables.  

Students were impressed with her use of everyday college quick fixes, such as Ramen, to make gourmet dishes.

"It's fast, nutritious and economical," Chef Pierre said after the lesson. 

After the events, students took the leftovers of the foods  to their homes.

Part of the health concern existing  at BBC includes not have a dining hall comparable to the one located at University Park, where foods are normally freshly prepared.  

Instead, they have a food court where mostly fast food is served.

 This doesn't help students who are hungry during the evening and don't have a car.  

"Who wants to cook when they have access to fast food and delivery? It's particularly a problem that we want to address because of the student's caloric intake," said Janet Tiberion, assistant director of the Wellness Center at BBC.

Cost, time and skill-level were taken into high consideration, according to Tiberion.

 "The purpose of this workshop would be to show cheap, fast and easy ways of cooking that [are] also healthy," Tiberion said. 

Resident assistants and housing resident advisors were  quite concerned about the amount of pizza boxes and fast-food bags they found coming in and out of the Bay Vista Apartments, often early in the morning. 

The Caribbean Food Makeover  was the perfect opportunity for residents to learn how to improve eating habits. 

"The food was really good," said Natasha Mack, a junior majoring in international relations. "And since we live in housing sometimes it's hard to make such elaborate meals.  This is quick and easy."  

Freshman Lara Pineda, who usually cooks for herself, said that she was now inspired to see what else she could make with a few essential ingredients.

"My favorite was the curry shrimp and shrimp pasta with Ramen. Now I have more ideas for my own meals," said Pineda, a freshman who is majoring in journalism.  

Students who say they just can't cook might not be getting enough hands-on experience or direction, noted Pierre.

"Everybody can cook," Pierre said. "You just need someone to cook something in front of you. My eyes take it in."

Books don't always work with cooking; you need that visual experience. Cooking is also about tasting. First, I taste and then I see color depending on the food that I am preparing."

Headline: Free food, energy drinks for exam cramming
Author: Danny Carratala / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Bust out the four-packs of Red Bull and cancel all appointments because finals week is approaching fast. For those who are unprepared, have no fear, because the Student Government Association and Honors Council have answered your prayers with their annual event, Cram Jam.  

Dec. 12 and Dec. 13, The Fresh Food Company will be re-opening its doors from 11:45 p.m. until 1:45 a.m. to accommodate those procrastinating study students in the library who need a quick bite to eat. Here, students are free to choose from scrambled eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage links, ice cream, pastries and bagels, free of charge with the presentation of a valid student ID.

In conjunction, the Green Library will also be extending its hours until 4:00 a.m. from Dec. 11 through Dec. 14, in order to meet the needs of the student body. For those nocturnal individuals who still need more time, the first floor of the Green Library and the Graham Center will be open 24 hours during the last week of classes. 

The GC pit will also be filled with students dancing, listening to music, and receiving free goodies during Cram Jam. Numerous organizations, such as Rockstar and Red Bull, will be having promotional events, handing out free T-shirts and energy drinks. For those who just need a quick and easy fix to satisfy them for a little longer, coffee and cookies will be available by the GC fish tank. 

"It's a way of the student government to thank the students," Alfonso Leon, SGA representative at large, said. 

Leon has been attending Cram Jam for the past five years and is very excited about all the things to be expected. "Each year, as more and more students find out about it, it is always bigger and better than the last." 

Even though Cram Jam is an event that most students should know about, many students were unaware it existed. "I don't even know where the cafeteria is," said junior Diana Guido. Other students, such as senior Eric Rocha, were already aware of this event. Even though he had never been to Cram Jam, Rocha seemed eager to attend. 

"It sounds like a fun event that will relieve me of my stressful life for a few hours," he said.

To further promote attendance to the event, those without an updated, valid student ID will be offered to purchase renewed identification cards for $5 next week, instead of the usual $15.

Every year, SGA and HC work countless hours and recruit numerous individuals and companies in order for the event to be a success. 

Cram Jam has been a staple on campus for over a decade now. Every year, students leave stuffed and satisfied and are motivated to study at the library and push themselves for a few more hours. In the end, all that matters is the final grade. Hopefully this semester will bring just as many satisfied students.

Subheadline: Surviving the holiday shopping stampede
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Assistant Editor
&nbsp;
The stores closed on Halloween with eager seasonal employees taking down jack-o-lanterns and putting up red and green crepe paper and haunting cardboard pictures of Santa's face. You may have been able to ignore it, but once Thanksgiving rolled around, his eyes started following you. He sees you when you're sleeping and he knows when you're awake. The shopping days are dwindling and you can almost feel the cold barrel of Santa's gun on the back of your neck as he whispers into your ear, "spend."

Sure, you can play the "poor college student" card and promise to bake everyone cookies this year, but that crap isn't going to fly with your mom. She's putting you through college and is expecting a big pay-off. Face it, at one point or another you're going to have to pass through the gates of hell into the Most Avaricious Lunatic's Lair - or more warmly known as the MALL. Here are tips on how to make it out alive: 


Make a list, check it twice:

Like any other disaster situation, the best way to enter is by being prepared. Make a game plan for what you'd like to buy and what stores you need to hit. Make sure you've had your caffeine and wear steel-toed shoes. Streamline your shopping experience by putting on blinders to flashy store fronts and other distractions. The mission is to get in and out as fast as possible, so don't get sidetracked - no matter how delicious those free teriyaki chicken samples are. 


Rocking around the parking lot:

Allow yourself at least an extra hour to get in and out of the parking lot. As you inch around the eight floors of wall to wall minivans and SUVs, neglect the burning urge to repeatedly slam your head against the steering wheel. That Honda logo imprint will take hours to wear off. Keep cool. If someone takes the parking space you've been waiting 23 minutes for, simply drive on because there will be others. Either that or you can stick a yule log in the offender's exhaust. 


"Jingle Bell Rock"ed:

There are only so many times one can listen to "grandma got run over by a reindeer" without wanting to take that reindeer and castrate it. Take your iPod or other musical device with you to the mall. It's the only way to block out the holiday fun. It also leaves you unable to respond to those annoying perfume snipers. Just remember to take the headphones off before being asked, "Would you like a gift box?" for the sixth time. 


Goodwill towards men:

Standing in line for more than five minutes at a place representing the most ridiculous need for material wealth is enough to make anyone snap -- especially when you consider all of that fluorescent lighting. 

Dealing with the masses may make it difficult to remember the Christmas ethic of "goodwill towards men" or even the simple commandment of "thou shall not kill." And while beating someone senseless in order to get the last must-have gift during the "season of giving" is wonderfully ironic, it's not worth jail time. You don't want your holiday photos to include a mug shot; it would be hard to explain to grandma.

You can de-stress by carrying a flask of the Christmas cheer of your choice and using it in extreme cases. Just don't over use it or you'll end up caroling in the middle of the hardware section at Sears. 


And to all a good night:

At the end of your shopping trip you may become ho ho homicidal. Don't let the aggravation block you from making sure you've bought everything you need. By getting everything done in one shot you avoid having to ever go back, at least until you eventually return the pair of musical elf socks your aunt thought were "just adorable."

When you're tired and weary just remember the faces of joy your friends and relatives will have upon receiving their thoughtful gifts on Christmas morning. If plans go awry this year, don't worry, you'll always have next year to throw away your precious work-study money on junk that will be forgotten or re-gifted by February. 

God bless us, everyone.

Headline: Changes should be made in workplace
Author: Rosabeth Moss Kanter / KRT Campus
&nbsp;
Happy holidays, workers of the world! It's that joyous time of year when workplaces resemble the joke about Russian factory workers: "We pretend to work, and the bosses pretend to pay us.''

Alas, for those without secure employment, that's not funny.

Recall the old social contract regarding work: A person started his career as an enthusiastic young person who overperformed and was undercompensated for it. That was acceptable because, over the next 35 years, he rose to a position where he could underperform and be overcompensated. It all evened out over a lifetime.

This caricature of secure employment is now just another joke. That industrial-era bargain is going, going, gone. See General Motors' big reductions in employee health insurance, while its suppliers seek wage cuts of as much as two-thirds.

The old industrial-era system assumed fixed employment, not mobility, with education and training primarily associated with promotion (and college tuition deductible only if improving skills in the present job). That system gave us employer-funded health insurance and pensions - benefits that were lost if the employee left. That era also produced legal definitions of full-time, part-time and overtime that seem quaint when work can occur anytime, anywhere linked by communications networks.

Today, people have been cut loose. For some, this is liberation from indentured servitude; they set their own terms of work as self-employed "free agents.'' But most are simply adrift.

For well over a decade, some companies have tried to make people a "variable cost'' rather than a fixed obligation by converting employees into independent contractors without benefits. The term "outsourcing'' originally referred not to shifting jobs to China and India, but to replacing permanent employees with temporary ones on someone else's payroll. In the 1990s, the temporary-staffing industry accounted for 10 percent of all U.S. job growth, despite accounting for only about 2 percent of total jobs, an MIT economist found. In 2000, Microsoft settled a lawsuit by "permatemps'' (who claimed they were indistinguishable from regular employees) for $97 million, ending a dispute that started in 1992.

Demographic changes pose a further challenge. If you've missed the media hype, baby boomers start to turn 60, Jan. 1. Surveys show that a high proportion of them want to keep working, perhaps at a new career, or community service, but with time for leisure or grandchildren.

Social policies and organizational practices have not fully dealt with new realities. America needs creative ideas that are good for people and for the future of a dynamic economy:


Health care 

Instead of demanding more from employers, including squeezing small businesses as some states propose, let's work toward universal tax-supported health-care coverage. A Gallup poll shows that 79 percent of Americans want it, and 69 percent are willing to pay for it with higher taxes.


Lifelong learning 

Imagine a GI Bill for veterans of industry wars to pay for college after they suffer from corporate restructuring. Or imagine Pell Grants (designed for young college students) extended to retirees who want education for a new career. Higher education builds skills that build the economy.


Savings

It's time for portable tax-advantaged savings accounts accessible at times of greatest need and matched by low-interest loans as well as employer contributions. People could draw funds when the family is growing, or for education when changing fields, without losing tax advantages. This would supplement, not replace, Social Security.


Work time

Some people have flexible work hours. Why not extend this and add flexible work years? Parents of young children might want months off during their kids' summer vacation. Mature workers might want months off during the cold winter season. Internet auctions could be used to match them, inside a company or across. Continental Airlines' web site that enables flight attendants to trade schedules is a useful model.

Headline: EPA, Republicans' policy harmful to environment
Author: Wayne Madsen / KRT Campus
&nbsp;
The Bush Administration and the Republicans in Congress fancifully believe that current fuel shortages are the result of restrictive environmental laws and regulations. Oil-centric politicians claim environmental laws have stemmed the construction of new oil refineries and hence, gasoline shortages.   Nothing could be further from the truth.

Even the Environmental Protection Agency, an agency that has been severely weakened by the Bush administration, admits that other factors have contributed to the current fuel shortage. 

The EPA cites rapidly escalating demand for energy, energy pricing policies, oil import quotas, lack of incentives to invest in domestic energy facilities, and depletion of domestic oil and gas reserves as contributing factors.

Nevertheless, much to the detriment of the environment, the EPA has become an environmental deregulator instead of an enforcer. The agency has waived regulations governing pollution by power plants and diesel generators and weakened fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. 

The planet is caught in a vicious cycle. As the United States continues to ignore urgent global appeals to join in a massive effort to curb CO2 and other environmentally destructive greenhouse gases, the effects of global warming become more disastrous. 

Record catastrophic hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, including hurricanes Katrina and Rita, have crippled offshore oil and natural gas operations, adding to fuel shortages.  

As the United States and other nations continue to roll back environmental laws and regulations, the surface temperatures of the world's oceans and the melting of the polar and glacial regions will intensify. That means continued destruction of maritime oil and natural gas facilities and a greater fuel shortage. This is a no-win situation. Some may even call it insane.

But insanity and the GOP Congress are not all that inseparable. In early October, the House of Representatives narrowly passed, by 212 to 210, the outrageous Gasoline for America's Security (GAS) Act. 

The bill relaxes air pollution controls on power plants and refineries nationwide. In addition, it fast tracks the construction of refineries on federal lands, including already heavily polluted closed military bases, as well as national wilderness lands and wildlife reserves.

In a very un-Republican move, the bill pre-empts local and state court authority to consider legal challenges to new refinery permits and transfers authority to the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. The bill fails to address the funding for and development of alternative energy sources like wind, solar, hydroelectric, and bio-diesel.

The sponsor of the bill, House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Joe Barton, R-Texas, is among those who just don't get it about the vicious cycle of pollution, global warming, and fuel shortages. He claims we can't stop hurricanes and their effects on our energy infrastructure but we should build more refineries so we have more gasoline. His solution is as reckless as it is simplistic.

As extreme weather conditions continue to wreak havoc on offshore and coastal oil and natural gas production facilities, the "energy infrastructure" referred to by Barton will never recover. 

And as we continue to build air polluting refineries and pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, ocean temperatures will increase, resulting in more killer storms that will continue to severely damage or destroy existing and new coastal refineries. 

From the House floor, Democrats roundly shouted "Shame! Shame!" as the GAS Act barely squeaked through. Indeed, the draconian GAS Act and other attempts to weaken environmental regulations and laws should be met with a national cry of "Shame!"

Headline: Increasing the global fuel supply a necessity
Author: iel Cohen / KRT Campus
&nbsp;
Gasoline prices may have stabilized, for now, but it's time to face an unpleasant reality: Demand for gasoline and kerosene is outstripping supply.

The current situation is unsustainable: Even as demand for these fuels has reached all-time highs, experts say supplies either have leveled off or begun to decline. The resulting high prices and scarcity threaten the global economy with recession or worse. Yet no moves have been made to expand refining, tanker or pipeline capacity or to remove the barriers to investment that prevent us from meeting these growing demands. 

Why? 

National oil companies control 58 percent of oil and natural gas reserves. In many of those countries, laws actually require that the government own or control significant shares of any oil-exploration ventures. But corruption in those very governments makes the multibillion-dollar investments required for oil exploration too risky.  

No one wants to sink billions into a project and see it disappear because of selective taxation, arbitrary laws, conflicting legal codes and unenforced contracts. Russia frightened away many investors by breaking up its major oil company, Yukos, and suing British Petroleum's Russian partner for $790 million in back taxes from 2001. Moreover, pipelines often must cross unstable countries, which make them even less attractive to investors.

Even in the United States, government intervention prevents an aggressive response to the problem. Before a company can seek a permit to build a refinery here, it must fully design the plant and have an environmental impact statement done on the design. This requires an investment of $250 million, according to one petroleum executive. Even then, the permit stands a less-than-even chance of approval. The Senate recently blocked a measure easing environmental guidelines which block new refinery construction and nixed drilling for natural gas on the continental shelf along the U.S. coasts.

Small wonder no new refineries have opened in the United States in 30 years. Or that spare capacity is at an all-time low.

But the problem goes deeper still. Even if new refineries opened tomorrow, the tankers that transport oil around the world are operating at essentially full capacity. Worse, international lending institutions are weak in many parts of the world, and significant portions of the funds they do have are diverted to high taxes and corruption, rather than expanding oil and gas supplies.

These problems can be solved, but they will require aggressive action by the Bush administration. Specifically, it should.

Change the investment climate. Join with other consumer countries, such as India and China, to urge oil-producing countries to normalize and enforce their foreign-investment laws, break up state monopolies and phase out undue government intervention. Condition the sales of arms and vital equipment, and even such carrots as membership in the World Trade Organization, on oil-producing countries improving the investment climate in the energy sector.

Make it easier to build more tankers, pipelines and refineries. Provide economic aid and technical assistance to oil-producing countries that expand in these areas, especially Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Encourage shipbuilding companies to expand the tanker fleet. Work with trade organizations such as the WTO, NAFTA and CAFTA to reduce barriers to investment in this sector. And streamline the process in the United States so that it won't be another 30 years before another refinery opens.

Look seriously at alternative fuels. Brazil cut its dependence on foreign fuel in half by insisting on fuel-flexible cars that can run on combinations of gas and ethanol. U.S. should cut the current 54-cent tariff on imported ethanol from Latin America and expand the fleet of flex-fuel cars and gas stations.

The real problem when it comes to energy is transportation fuels, not electricity, which can be generated from coal and nuclear reactors. And there are no silver-bullet solutions. Americans aren't going to stop driving. Neither are Chinese or Indians or Europeans or anyone else. But the forces that are squeezing supplies do not abate, either.

So it's time to meet the challenge head-on and do what it takes to expand the transportation fuel supply before it's too late.
