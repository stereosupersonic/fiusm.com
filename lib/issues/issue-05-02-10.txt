Headline: Still ticking
Subheadline: Even after so many years, the Kit-Cat clock still maintains its mass appeal
Author: Jennifer J. Bush / The Orange Country Register
&nbsp;
No matter how clever the cat, it seems that by the age of 66, any feline would have exhausted each of its nine lives. 

But not the smiling Kit-Cat. 

The nostalgic wall clock with the shifty eyes and wagging tail has kept ticking since 1939. Those who recognize the animated timepiece from their youth are often surprised to find that the famous cat is still being produced. 

"Kit-Cat is an important piece of Americana," said Woody Young, owner of the California Clock Co. in Fountain Valley, which manufactures Kit-Cat. 

"It's not just any clock," Young said. "People feel attached to it." 

Such sentiment echoes among the more than 15,000 members in the 20-year-old Kit-Cat fan club. 

"They write in with heartfelt stories from their childhood," said Spryte Loriano, who has recounted these personal stories as the company's fan club newsletter editor for 17 years.

Such accounts include a woman who remembers being comforted by the smiling cat in her dentist's office as a child and another who says "the purring" from her old electric clock keeps her company. 

Fan club member Pamela Bertva, was a baby when her parents put the clock in her room in 1946. The Michigan resident wrote: "I was actually scared of the clock at first because of the eyes that glowed in the dark. But the soothing sound of the motor used to lull me to sleep and I grew to cherish it. Now I never want to be without it. It brings back happy childhood memories."

Young took over as the company's third president in 1982, running the business from its corporate headquarters in Fountain Valley, with manufacturing in Torrance. 

Designer Earl Arnault (1904-1971) has been credited as the clock's creator, although his name never appeared on the clock. 

The earliest clocks, produced in 1939, are marked with the name Clifford Stone, along with his company, Allied Manufacturing in Portland, Ore. 

In the 1940s, stamps reveal that the clocks were made in Seattle. In the early `60s, the company moved its operation to El Monte and changed its name to The California Clock Co. A few years later, the company relocated again to San Juan Capistrano, Calif., where it remained for 30 years. 

Young still maintains a post office box in San Juan Capistrano because of the number of printed materials still circulating with this address nationwide. 

The internal clock mechanism evolved from a wind-up style to electric and finally battery operation during its life span. However, the appearance of its 15 {-inch-by-4-inch plastic body hasn't changed much since front paws and a bow tie were added in the early `50s. 

The original, classic black Kit-Cat with the white bow tie still outsells all of the company's products. "It's always been the most popular," Young said. "There's a mystique about it." 

Other animals including Disney's Pluto, a teddy bear, a panda, a poodle and an owl were made for a short time during the company's history, but nothing sold like Kit-Cat. Besides the classic gentleman cat, a lady Kit-Cat, limited-edition colors and jeweled models adorned with Swarovski crystals have been among the product offerings. 

Despite the clock's popularity, this bit of nostalgia was nearly lost in the 1980s. The introduction of battery-powered, digital clocks cut the need and therefore the production of American-made electric motors, essential to the Kit-Cat, sending their cost skyrocketing. 

"Our choice was to raise prices astronomically or come up with a new mechanism for battery operation," Young said. 

At that time, the technology for a battery powerful enough to run the clock's one-second animation, which moved the eyes and tail, did not exist. A method of running the clock's precision mechanisms with less energy had to be explored. 

By 1990, the company had developed the capability for two C-size batteries to supply the power for animation and time keeping. Kit-Cat's operation requires precision balancing of all the inner workings of the clock with gravity keeping moving parts in motion at a controlled speed. To reduce the required energy, the eyes were made of a lighter plastic. 

It didn't take long for the outdated electric clocks to become collectors' items. 

Models from the `40s and `50s have sold for several hundred dollars on eBay. Because of its scarcity, Young estimates that the wind-up model from 1939 could go for as much as $10,000 at auction. 

Although he hesitated to give production figures, he indicated: "Every three minutes of every hour of every day for more than 50 years, someone has put one on their wall."

The popularity of the clock continues to surprise him. 

Kit-Cat and its counterparts, Fifi the poodle, and Professor Timebelly the owl, appeared in the opening scene of the 1985 movie "Back to the Future," and in last year's "13 Going On 30." When a tiny blurb about the clock ran in Parade magazine a few years ago the number of calls nearly collapsed the company's phone system. 

"People don't realize that Orange County is home to an American icon," Young said. 

Kit-Cat clocks are available at local Bed, Bath and Beyond, Restoration Hardware and independent clock shops. To find a store or to order online, log on to www.kit-cat.com.

Headline: 'Gilmore Girls' celebrates 100 episodes
Author: Amy Amatangelo / Zap2it.com
&nbsp;
Now, I don't want to over-hype it, but this week's 100th episode of "Gilmore Girls" (Tuesdays, WB) may have been the best episode the series has ever had. At the end, there is a moment so chilling, delivered with such pitch-perfect aplomb that it left me staring at my TV in silent shock. 

So this column isn't about the missteps the show has taken along the way or concerns that the show may be repeating itself (is Logan the new Tristan)? Today's column is about celebrating one of television's best and most overlooked series. 

Since its premiere in 2000, the heart, strength and soul of the series has always rested on the show's inter-generational strife. 

The series has given us some indelible characters. Scott Patterson's Luke Danes has done for coffee shops what John Corbett did for radio stations on "Northern Exposure." Kelly Bishop and Edward Hermann's Emily and Richard are such real, vibrant characters. 

Yes, they are wealthy snobs but they are also devoted parents and grandparents and, as this week's episode proves, loyal and devoted spouses. And we all know I still want to be Lorelai when I grow up.

From the characters who only get sporadic screen time (I love Lane's boyfriend) to the town residents who've been there since day one (Ms. Patty and Babette), Stars Hollow embraces its members and by extension its viewers. 

It's the type of town that only exists on television but is so believable that it has become a major character. The last time I felt this connected to made-up location was 1984. That was the year I told my mom I wanted to go to Pine Valley for our family vacation.

As we celebrate the milestone episode, let's look back on some of my favorite episodes:

Rory's Birthday Parties (Nov. 9, 2000): A befuddled Emily and Richard attend the birthday party Lorelai throws for her in Stars Hollow. It establishes the "we're fish out of water in each other's worlds" subtext that sustains the series.

The Road Trip to Harvard (Oct. 21, 2001): This episode featured Lorelai's poignant trip to Harvard where, with no dialogue, we see her reflect on the life she might have had if she had not become pregnant at 16. Luke builds a chuppah for Lorelai and Max's wedding. And it still takes Lorelai almost three years to realize Luke loves her.

I Can't Get Started (May 21, 2002): In the second season finale, Lorelai and Christopher briefly reunite only to find out that Sherry is pregnant and Jess and Rory kiss for the first time.

Raincoats and Recipes (May 18, 2004): In the fourth season finale, Rory sleeps with Dean, a married man. I stand by my earlier statement that the show is stronger because Rory did something we didn't approve of. Also Luke and Lorelai finally kiss. What more could we ask for?

Headline: Singer not worthy of admiration
Author: John Lovell / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
"Music genius." "Child prodigy." "Rock and roll troubadour." "Bob Dylan!?" The scrawny Nebraskan I absolutely love to hate has so many names nowadays, but I only know him by one: CONOR. A colleague of mine and I have shared the ongoing joke for the past year to make fun of this poor boy and his band as often as possible - ad nauseam.

We always make sure to get our daily dose of Conor-bashing fun. We draw little hearts with "Conor" written inside, send each other i3conor text messages and blame our daily mishaps and bad luck on him. 

Oh and of course, we absolutely never, ever, ever refer to him as Bright Eyes. Endless amount of fun is just waiting to be had in making fun of Conor.

When I was given the opportunity to write this review on his latest musical doings, I relished the opportunity to share that joke with you because I think it perfectly captures my thoughts and feelings on Bright Eyes. 

The media is hailing him as the poster boy for a new indie generation (I don't know to which generation they keep referring - certainly not mine!), and everybody's drooling all over the place and doing insane things like calling him the next Bob Dylan. The boy's definitely got our attention now with his new albums I'm Wide Awake It's Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn.

I won't spend my review getting into these two albums much because, honestly, there's not much to get into. It's Conor, and that's all there is to it. Just like his previous releases such as Lifted and Fevers and Mirrors, this album isn't half bad at all. In fact they're even mildly enjoyable, especially Wide Awake. 

The main problem I have with both of these albums, especially Digital Ash, is the same problem I have with his other releases. Yes, there are some undeniably good songs, but there are so many bad ones too. What he's done, yet again, is compile a mix of songs that equal painful mediocrity. 

So what if he's been recording since the age of 15? He's still very young, - only 22 - and it shows when he lumps all of these incompatible songs together without discrimination or continuity.  Maybe the albums feel rushed too. I mean, why the double album thing? I'd rather he finally take some time and release a solid Bright Eyes album that really shows his worth as an artist.

I think what really irritates me though is that nobody seems to realize  all of this. Everyone orgasms over his new releases without reason and celebrates his work which is, for the most part, forgettable. I wish more people would take the time to really listen and not be so afraid to criticize him. Nowadays, it seems as though when anything shiny catches our attention we merrily shower it with all of our love and admiration. I think Conor needs to work a little harder for that.

So while two new records run amok in the media, I'll go on hating him. Actually, I'm really glad he's playing at the Coachella Valley Music Festival again, because last year, half the fun of the festival was making fun of him and counting how many of those stupid green Bright Eyes shirts we saw. There must have been, like, two billion. 

All silliness aside, I will say that his music suddenly becomes mysteriously more interesting the minute you start to make fun of him. You should really try it sometime.

Headline: Sexual crimes go unreported
Author: Taquesha Brannon / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It is a Saturday night and a student is looking forward to going to her first college party. At the party, she sees an old male friend from high school. When the party is over, he offers to take her home and she accepts his offer. However, he does not take her home. Instead, he drives her to a dark and deserted park where he rapes her. 

Afterward, she feels guilty and ashamed and she blames herself for getting into the car.   

While this may seem like a scene out of a movie, rape is much more common than people think.

According to Lourdes Martin, outreach coordinator for the Victim Advocacy Center, rape is never the victim's fault. 

"Victims should know that they did nothing wrong, and no matter what, the circumstances were, that no one deserves to have his or her body violated," said Martin.

VAC statistics show  that sexual assault on campus is rising each year. They also show that most victims have trouble reporting an assault because they question their consent in it. 

The Jackson Health System of Jackson Memorial Hospital reported that some "victims are accused of causing their own rape by dressing sexy, drinking alcohol, walking or partying alone with a man. None of these actions are criminal acts. These acts never justify rape. Rape is a violent act which uses sex as a weapon to exert power over someone, and humiliate or violate someone."

Because acquaintances commit approximately 84 percent of rapes, the situation is sometimes awkward and most victims feel that they may have initiated the attack.

While a high percentage of sexual assault victims are those of acquaintance rape, many also reported being assaulted by an unfamiliar person or persons.

"I was once walking my way to the Taco Bell on 107th Ave. from the University Park campus, when I saw someone in the distance. It was night already so I was getting kind of scared. The figure focused, and I saw it was a middle-aged man making his way towards me," said a female sophomore. "I sped up a bit, and when I turned around, I saw he had his pants down, masturbating while looking at me. I was disgusted, and I felt extremely violated, even though I ran out of his reach. It is a traumatic experience I will never forget."

Despite her experience, the anonymous sophomore never reported the crime.

This is why victims of sexual assault are encouraged to come forward and report their crimes to the VAC and to the FIU Public Safety Office.

"Be a good friend and be a good support center. Suggest their options and go to the Victim Advocacy Center," said Sergeant Shona McNeil, Investigations Crime Prevention officer, on what friends of sexual assault victims should do.  

The VAC offers free and confidential services, including those offered by trained clinicians. There are also alternative support options and the center is willing to work according to a client's comfort zone.

Headline: Parallel pledges made to end attacks
Author: Cliff Churgin and Warren P. Strobel / Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
Israelis and Palestinians will declare an end to attacks on each other during a summit Tuesday at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik, although officials said on Monday that the separate declarations by each side would fall short of a formal cease-fire to end more than four years of fighting.

The pledges, which will be made during a summit meeting of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, make public and explicit their commitment to end the conflict. The leaders' meeting is the first since Abbas won election a month ago following the death of longtime Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in November.

The form of the announcements - parallel statements rather than a joint declaration - underscores the difficulty of reaching peace. Abbas lacks control over militant groups responsible for most attacks on Israel, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

Israel will declare an end to offensive Israeli military actions, including the search for wanted men, but the declaration is to be conditional on a cessation of Palestinian offensive actions, including production of Kassam rockets, weapons smuggling and incitement. This is largely a restatement of current Israeli policy.

"How can you have a cease-fire when one side can't even enforce it?" said a senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat also shied away from the term cease-fire. "All I can say at this stage is that Palestinians are committed to stopping violence against Israelis anywhere and Israelis will stop violence against Palestinians anywhere, but the details will be discussed in a committee," he told Knight Ridder.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, visiting the West Bank city of Ramallah Monday, lauded what she called "the most promising moment for progress between Palestinians and Israelis in recent years" and announced the appointment of a senior U.S. coordinator to cement a cease-fire between the sides.

Rice's naming of the official, Army Lt. Gen. William E. Ward, represents a modest increase in U.S. involvement in the Middle East conflict at a moment of diplomatic opportunity.

Ward's job will be to help create conditions for a durable peace, primarily by building up Palestinian security forces that can stop terrorist attacks on Israel.

But Rice said the general would not be involved in political negotiations over a future Palestinian state - leaving that up to the two sides, not the United States, to determine.

Headline: SPOTLIGHT ON: Pan-African Heritage Club
Author: Beatriz Dominguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It's February, and Black History month is here, which means it's time to evolve. Evolution is the theme of the Black History month events sponsored by the Pan-African Heritage Club this year. 

The PAHC is a multi-cultural group that works under the Student Programming Council and is comprised of a diverse group of individuals who enjoy celebrating African-based culture from all over the world. 

The Pan-African Club's foundation is based on their mission of PRIDE - preserving culture, raising awareness, inspiring change, designing their image and exposing the truth. 

The PAHC has been working hard to put the finishing touches on the events set to take place throughout the month of February.

Nina Nunes, the Pan-African Club chairperson, hosted the Black History Month opening ceremonies on Jan. 31 in the Graham Center Pit. 

"We had African music and dancing. It was an excellent way to kick off the festivities," said Nunes. 

According to Nunes, the opening night set the tone for what will hopefully be a great month of movies, lectures, formal dinners and guest speakers. 

"I wasn't expecting to have a such a good time. The music and the dancing were unbelievable," said sophomore Marvin Vanegas.

If you missed the opening ceremonies and some of the initial Black History Month events, there's still plenty of time to enjoy African-rooted culture in the coming weeks. On Feb. 7 the club will join the Haitian Student Association, the Black Student Union and the African Student Association to host "The Legacy Continues: Pan-African Leaders," a tribute to leaders on campus who help keep FIU's African clubs going strong. 

The tribute will be held at 8 p.m. in the GC Ballroom at University Park.  Mr. and Mrs. Pan-African will be announced later that night. 

Later in the month, the PAHC will host dinner and show the critically acclaimed movie, "Ray." They will also show the "Ssshh" series this month, which features everything from African-American religion to Malcolm X and the African-American family. 

The PAHC will conclude Black History Month with an amateur comedy night in the GC Ballroom.

"The comedy night is also co-sponsored by the SPC, and it's the best way to end Black History Month on a happy note," Nunes said.

If you're looking for a way to celebrate Black History Month or simply want to attend some interesting lectures and performances, the PAHC's February schedule can be found in GC 340.

"Black history is our history - it's world history! You are a part of this. I encourage all students to get involved and grow with one another," Nunes said.

Headline: Students lack CLAST guidance
Author: John Lovell / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
The SAT and ACT are the most notorious acronyms that strike terror into the hearts of students. 

In high school, we spent hundreds of dollars to prepare for these tests with books, tutors and classes, and our futures hung on how well we scored. 

Now, as college students, many of us have put those big acronym tests behind us.  Unless, of course, you plan to attend graduate school, then the GRE, LSA and/or MCAT await you. 

I never knew these tests could come back to haunt me. 

Earlier this January, after discovering that the spring graduation deadline was just around the corner, I hurried over to the tiny graduation office to apply. Everything was good to go. 

I was on track to graduate with all my requirements out of the way and even a decent GPA, but I had not yet satisfied just one requirement - the blasted mathematics portion of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) exam! 

There was no way I would be eligible to graduate this spring after all.

Since August 1, 1984, every  student seeking a bachelor's degree at Florida (and only Florida) public institution is required to either receive an exemption for or pass a little standardized test called the CLAST. 

There are four different sections to this exam: English, reading, essay writing, and mathematics. 

Most students will find that if their SAT or ACT scores meet the national average, they will receive an automatic exemption. Luckily, I was exempt from every single section of the CLAST, except for the math portion. The required ACT math score for a CLAST exemption is a 21. I scored a 20.

Angry and worried, I hurried to sign up for this godforsaken exam. I was told that the most I could do was take the math portion, pass it, and submit the results to the graduation office for a summer graduation with an exemption to walk in the spring. 

I had to shell out $30 because I missed the deadline to register through Panthersoft. 

Fortunately, I looked the test in the eye and passed it without a problem. The required passing score is a 295 and I squeezed by with a 305. My major concern is the lack of information about the CLAST requirements, exemptions, waivers and deadlines. 

I imagine this is all supposed to be common knowledge, and it's true that you can find oodles of information about it on the web, but I feel an effort isn't being made to stress the importance of passing the CLAST in time for graduation. 

Yes, my advisors told me to get it out of the way, but I never knew I would be unable to submit my application for graduation until I had fulfilled the requirement.

 Additionally, there is very little information readily available about CLAST registration deadlines and what to do if you miss them. There is plenty of information available if you run a Google search, but so many students are completely unaware of how crucial knowing this information is to their graduation.

FIU should make more of an effort to encourage students to educate themselves about the CLAST and to fulfill their CLAST requirements on time. 

Students should be more informed about FIU's CLAST policies, all the exam requirements, when its deadlines are, how to register for the test and how to find out if they are eligible for a waiver or exemption.

According to Kenton Harris, Assistant Dean of Arts and Sciences, the number one reason why students don't graduate when they expect to is because of an outstanding CLAST requirement.

I am also surprised that there is such a lack of information regarding the graduation process. 

My roommates didn't know about the deadline to apply for graduation until I found out. We have enough on our plates with keeping our grades up in highly demanding class schedules each semester. 

A thorough CLAST information service on FIU's website, for example, would go a long way for students who aren't in the know about the exam and would reduce the graduation-related stress for students and FIU staff.

Headline: Baseball gets swept, drop third straight
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After starting the season with a two-game sweep over FAMU, the Golden Panthers lost three straight games.

The team was swept by UCF over the weekend on Feb. 5 and 6, in Orlando, Fla. Both games ended with a final score of 3-2. FIU dropped their record to 2-3.

In the first game, pitcher David Asher went six innings and allowed two unearned runs but walked six batters. Offensively, junior Yahmed Yema went 2-for-4 with a double, an RBI and a run scored.

In the second game, freshman Elih Villanueva pitched six and two-third innings of work, allowing three earned runs and striking out six. 

Junior Michael Lopez led FIU offensively, going 2-for-4 with two doubles and a run scored.

In game one, junior Randy Youtsey led-off by drawing a walk and eventually came around to score off a sacrifice fly by Yema.

UCF answered back in the second inning with a rally that began with an FIU error. Asher then allowed four consecutive walks that scored two runs, taking a 2-1 lead. 

"That one inning kind of got away from us," said coach Danny Price. "We had a hard time finding the plate."

FIU tied the game in the fourth when junior Yosvel Barroso drove in Yema off another FIU sacrifice fly.

The game went into extra innings after being tied 2-2, but in the 10th inning UCF won the game off a two-out hit off reliever Matt Rainey that reached the wall in right-center field. 

"I thought we played a pretty good game, but we didn't hit when we had to," said Yema. "We made a couple of errors on the field, and that's what cost us the game."

Game two was a pitcher's duel until the sixth inning when UCF scored off a single. 

Then in the seventh, it was déjà vu for FIU as UCF began a rally off another FIU error. Villanueva proceeded to walk two batters to load the bases. 

Junior Frank Gonzalez came in relief of Villanueva and allowed a single that scored two runs, making it 3-0.

FIU threatened UCF in the eighth inning but scored no runs as they ended the inning with the bases left loaded.

FIU would not get on the board until the ninth. The rally began with a Lopez double and with Yema and Barroso each drawing a walk to load the bases. With two outs, sophomore Cody Jacobs was hit by a pitch to score FIU's first run, and freshman Corey Lozano drew another walk to score the second. After a UCF pitching change, Youtsey grounded out to end the game.

"It's early in the season," Price said. "Our goal right now is to be the best 2-3 club in the country."

Headline: Golden Panthers suffer back to back losses
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Junior Matias made seven three pointers and finished the game with a career-high of 30 points for FIU, but that wasn't enough as the team lost 82-69 to Middle Tennessee on Feb. 5.

FIU turned over the ball 25 times because they lacked the same energy that powered their win in five overtimes just the night before. 

On the road in front of a hostile crowd of just under 4,000, Ivan Almonte, who has been solid all year, turned over the ball seven times while notching his ninth double-double of the year. Despite his double-double, he only shot 3-of-8 from the field for 15 points, nine of them coming from the stripe. 

Junior Ismael N'Diaye also struggled, managing just 10 points. He shot just 2-of-7 from the field as the team shot just under 42 percent for the night. 

FIU could not solve the tandem of Marcus Morrison and Mike Dean as they finished with 26 and 18 points, respectively. 

Morrison came alive in the second half for the hosts, who lead by three at the half, scoring 24 of his 26, after the break. 

"Junior Matias has the heart and soul of a lion," said coach Sergio Rouco after the loss. "I told him I'm going to play him until he drops. We've got six more games in [the] conference, and hopefully as many more in tournament play. All we ever ask of kids is to give it their all. Junior certainly gave us his all tonight." 

WKU 83 FIU 67

It seemed to be just another night for the FIU men's basketball team on the road and in the conference. 

Despite four players in double figures, Western Kentucky beat FIU by 16, 83-67 on Feb. 7. Four FIU starters: Ivan Almonte, Ismael N'Diaye, Junior Matias and Byron Burnett found themselves in double figures, but it wasn't enough.

Almonte led the way for the Golden Panthers, finishing with 15 points and nine rebounds. N'Diaye and Matias each added 12 in the loss, while Burnett notched 10. 

FIU could not stop the Hilltoppers leading scorer, Anthony Winchester, who exploded for 27 points as his team connected on 14-of-25 three-point attempts. 

"Western Kentucky shot the ball well tonight, but our effort on their shooters has to be better," Rouco said. "At this level, good shooters aren't going to miss. Your defense has got to make them miss. Our guys haven't bought into that yet."

The story of the night, however, may have been the play of freshmen walk-on Antonio Jones. With starter Jayce Lewis sidelined for most of the game because of the flu, the freshmen took over the point and played 38 minutes. After the game, his head coach spoke of his performance. 

"I thought Antonio played great tonight, and right now he's my starting point guard until Jayce comes back and beats him at practice," Rouco said.

With the win, the Hilltoppers moved to 16-5 overall and 6-3 in the conference. The loss drops the Golden Panthers to 8-14 and 1-8 in the Sun Belt. 

Up next for FIU on Feb. 14

On a two-game losing streak, the Golden Panthers come into Monday night's game at Pharmed Arena with only three home games remaining this season.  Monday's showdown with Arkansas State could be crucial as the team looks to improve their conference record before the start of tournament play as well as end their two-game skid. 

Following the game at Western Kentucky, freshmen Antonio Jones looks to be the front runner to run the point for the Golden Panthers. Coach Sergio Rouco has said that after Jones' recent performances, only Jayce Lewis outplaying him in practice will sit him on the bench. FIU will look to minimize on-the-court mistakes, as turnovers and poor shooting decisions have hurt them this season at home. 

The Golden Panthers will look for a big night from juniors Ivan Almonte and Ismael N'Diaye, as well as a solid performance from Junior Matias as he goes into his three final home games. 

The team will look to avenge a five-point loss to Arkansas State that dates back to Jan. 8, and will look to notch its second conference victory of the season. 

Coach Sergio Rouco's men would surely like to gain some speed heading into the conference tournament were everybody pretty much starts at the same place. 

What has happened this season is in the past, and as the Golden Panthers look toward their final five games of the season, before the tournament starts on March 6, only one thing can be on their mind: play sound, aggressive and turnover-free basketball.

WKU 88 FIU 67

Like many other teams in the NCAA, the Golden Panthers could not find a way to stop Western Kentucky.

Led by Leslie Logsdon's game-high 35 points, the Lady Toppers defeated FIU, 88-67, at Pharmed Arena on Feb. 5

Coming off a 12-day hiatus, FIU suffered their worst Sun Belt Conference game this season. Western Kentucky shot 48.7 percent for the game, out-rebounded FIU, 46 to 36 and dominated the paint with 42 points.

Western Kentucky picked off their 11th straight victory and fifth straight over the Golden Panthers. Logsdon had her way all game long setting Pharmed Arena opponent records in both three-point field goals made (7), and three-point field goal percentage (.700), finishing just one trey shy of her career high.

Tomova led FIU in the loss with 23 points, eight rebounds and five blocks, while tying her career high with four assists.

FIU 66 MTSU 55

The Golden Panthers got back on the win column with a 66-55 victory over Middle Tennessee at Pharmed Arena on Feb. 7. 

Freshman LaQuetta Ferguson came off the bench to lead FIU with a career-high 19 points.

The Golden Panthers connected on 57.4 percent of their shots to tie their season high, and hit 55.6 percent from long range (5-of-9)-their second best performance of the year.

After losing the battle of the boards against Western Kentucky, FIU took that into account and out-rebounded the Lady Raiders 33 to 25.

Coach Cindy Russo liked the team's improvement.

"We were a lot more focused this game than against Western Kentucky," said Russo.  "We executed the ball better, handled it better and shot well.  We handled the pressure better."

The game plan also worked out efficiently for FIU.

"Tonight we played hard, smart and together.  We came out from the jump with a plan and we executed that our plan and that's why we came out victorious," said Ferguson.
