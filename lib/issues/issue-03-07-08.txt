Headline: Who Pays for the Tuition?
Subheadline:  
Author: LBenit03@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
As FIU grows larger, it is evident the concern for its students gets smaller.  As FIU tries to race through years of experience to reach the ranks of UF and other great public institutions, it misses MANY, MANY important lessons along the way. 
 I, like many, pay for this school with my hard earned money- no financial aid- and for what?  Is this increase in tuition going to give us higher calibered professors?  Will it assure me the small class sizes that were promised long ago in the propaganda FIU handed out back in highschool?  Will I be able to PARK LEGALLY without sitting for hours waiting for a space to become available?  Oh wait..FIU IS putting in new garages which will alleviate the chaos that is FIU Parking.  When do they decide to put these in?  They construct them in the Summer so they won't be done until Spring.  Where does that leave Fall, the busiest semester of the year?  It leaves Fall with less parking spaces then before as many of you have already seen.  There are many things I can sit here and ponder about like the need for SUV Cop cars and the like, but why say anything if nothing will be done of it.  
The reason is because I'm sure every student and even professor at FIU feels the same, and I was ecstatic when I read the article regarding the Elevators and thought the person who wrote the article was on to something.  They were on to uncovering the truth about FIU.
I'd like to know the truth.  I'd like to know where my money goes.  Wouldn't you?

Headline: Men's basketball hires two new coaches
Subheadline: Burden, Labrada to fill assistant vacancies left by Rouco, Williams
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Head men's basketball coach Donnie Marsh confirmed the hiring of two new assistant coaches on July 5, adding Mike Burden and Jesus Labrada to the staff.

Burden, formerly an assistant at Cornell University, and Labrada, who formerly coached at the University of Miami, will replace departed FIU assistants, Sergio Rouco and Lonnie Williams.

Marsh spoke very highly of the new coaches, and is optimistic they can help his basketball team improve.

"First of all, both guys will do a great job relating to our players," Marsh said in a phone interview on July 5. 

"Both are young, aggressive, and hungry, and they are going to do a terrific job," he added.

Burden, who was the lead recruiter at Cornell, is expected to bring his top notch recruiting skills to FIU.

"I think [Burden] has done a really good job of establishing contacts throughout the country," Marsh said.

With Marsh and assistant coach Don Kelbick's basketball roots already based in the New York/New Jersey area, Burden should help establish more contacts in the region, considered one of the nation's premier grounds for basketball talent.

"We have a nice pipeline into the Northeast," Marsh answered when asked about the significance that the New York/New Jersey area has on recruiting efforts.

But more than that, Marsh is looking to richen his team by recruiting inside the state of Florida, which is where Labrada comes into play.

"There are some really good quality players in Florida," Marsh said. "We are bringing a renewed interest in the state of Florida."

Labrada, who runs basketball camps within the state, has already established good relationships with other coaches in the state, and Marsh thinks Burden's personality will help him do the same.

In addition to recruiting efforts, Marsh also wants Burden to help the Golden Panther front court improve.

"[Mike] was an outstanding player that I coached against, and he should do a terrific job with our post guys," Marsh said.

Labrada, on the other hand, is known for developing players' individual basketball skills.

"Jesus had a lot to do with John Salmons from UM coming from nowhere [and turning him into] a first round [NBA] draft pick," said Marsh. "He also had a lot to do with [former Miami Hurricanes player] James Jones and helping him get drafted in the second round by the Indiana Pacers," Marsh added.

And developing players like he did at UM is exactly what Marsh hopes Labrada to carry over into FIU.

"Jesus is terrific with individual instruction work," Marsh said.

"[He's also] one of the best film breakdown and game breakdown guys there is," Marsh added.

Now with the two newest members of the FIU basketball program on board, Marsh and his coaches are ready to get down to business with their players.

"It's very important to work with our current kids," said Marsh. "And these two are a perfect fit."

Headline: Summer camps give local youth opportunity to grasp FIU
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With summer here, and FIU's sports season over until the fall, the Golden Panther coaches are given an opportunity to sit back and relax until competition resumes in the fall.

But most of the FIU coaches dismiss this notion, choosing to better their respective programs during the off-season instead.

In addition to constant recruiting efforts around the clock, the FIU coaches have found another way to showcase their programs for potential future Golden Panthers - by offering youth summer camps for each respective sport.

"We try to expose our players and coaches, so the kids can get a feel for what kind of program we are," said assistant women's basketball coach Didi Cotton, who runs the FIU Women's Basketball Team Camp.

Cotton's camp is a league consisted of seven to eight high school girl's basketball teams, who are given the opportunity to display their skills in a tournament-style league and hopefully better prepare themselves for the next level.

Head volleyball coach Cookie Steven offers a similar camp for local high school volleyball teams.

"[Our] team camp in the evening has 12 high school teams from Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which gives an opportunity for them to play other teams that they don't usually get to play," said Stevens. "It's been very successful."

In addition to girl's basketball and volleyball, FIU offers camps in baseball, football, soccer, boys' basketball, softball, and even martial arts and swimming.

The baseball camp, run by head baseball coach Danny Price and pitching coach Mark Calvi, gives campers not only a first hand look at FIU's baseball program, but more importantly, a chance to get to know the game and enjoy themselves.

"The biggest part is that they have a good time and have some fun," said Price. "We try to further their love for the game, and gain them some experience."

Price's camp teaches fundamentals in the morning, and provides games in the afternoon.

For the campers who stay all day until their parents get out of work, Price's camp offers other activities in addition to baseball.

"The kids go swimming and play kickball and other things like that," Price said.

Head women's soccer coach Everton Edwards offers the FIU Soccer Academy for boys and girls, not only to teach kids new skills, but to give back to the community as well.

"I look at our camp from two standpoints. One is from a community standpoint, and the other from the recruitment standpoint," Edwards said. 

"We really try to develop a good relationship with the community," he added.

Head softball coach Kim Gwydir offers a girl's softball camp that teaches girls the fundamentals of the game, and also provides a pitcher-catcher camp as well.

In addition to coaching, Gwydir's camp also gives the softball program a chance to display its facilities and raise money for the program.

"The camp exposes our facilities and [raises funds]," Gwydir said.

The football program also offers a camp for youngsters. The FIU "Air Strike" Passing Camp gives young football players a chance to become a champion in the seven-on-seven tournament, which is a Round-Robin tournament crowning one winner at the end.

The Judo Martial Arts Summer Camp, organized by Nestor Bustillo, teaches kids judo and other martial arts skills. 

The camp includes judo instruction, an official camp T-shirt, awards, a USJI membership card, tournament entry, and lunch.

Head basketball coach Donnie Marsh hosts "Marsh's Winners Only Basketball Camps" which gives kids a chance to play in the Golden Panther Arena. 

In addition to the personal instruction and league play, the camp also rewards kids with T-shirts, basketballs, and other prizes.

"The camp instructs kids on the fundamentals of the game, while teaching the kids how to compete in [game situations] and teaching sportsmanship and teamwork," said Marsh.

And Marsh is happy the camp's rapid growth.

Added Marsh: "This is our fourth camp, and it's grown each year, so we're excited."

FIU also offers Panther Summer Day Camp, which is run by the girl's volleyball team, and treats campers to computers, arts and crafts, weekly field trips, swimming, special guests, in addition to sports and games.

"The kids get to play in the game room in GC, swim in the pool, and other stuff," Stevens said.

"It's great because a lot of the kids' parents work here, and it gives the kids a chance to walk around a college campus and get to know FIU," Stevens added.

The costs of the camps vary from as low as $80 for Gwydir's pitcher-catcher softball camp to as much as $400 for Edward's residential soccer camp.

Headline: Mello: Football ticket sales ahead of pace
Author: Alain Castillo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With FIU's second football season still about two months away, ticket sales have exceeded early expectations, already netting 1,400 individual season tickets sold.

After selling 3,465 single tickets in FIU's inaugural season, the football program is hopeful they can meet last year's totals, and are optimistic with a couple of months to go.

Jan Allen, External Associate of Ticket Sales, says that the goal is to increase sales by 60 percent. 

"No second year program has been able to reach this goal. We are challenging it and trying to stop the trend [of coming short]," said Allen.

In order to meet the challenge, ticket sale officers have converted the ticket system into an outreach machine. Now, there are group ticket rates such as family plans, a six-game deal for $120, corporate partnership involvement, and youth group offerings. 

They are also offering commission-only sales and have reached out to sponsors of Community Partners for Youth for $50 donations as well.

 In addition, a campaign for the school's 80,000 alumni is underway through telemarketing, in which former Golden Panther students will be called twice a week in hopes of getting more people in "The Cage" on Saturdays.

Next week, the ticket officers will begin a three-week mailing campaign, sending ticket plans to selected groups. 

On Aug. 1, a web site will also be provided where tickets can be bought online.

With all these ticket-selling efforts underway, Allen and FIU football seem ready to take the program to the next level.

FIU, who plays in Division 1-AA, hopes these efforts will soon help them sell enough tickets to move to Division 1--A, where statewide football programs such as UM, UF, UCF, USF, and FSU play. That would only be possible if more stadium seats are added to reach a capacity of 30,000, and if they can average an attendance of 15,000 fans per game.

Athletic director Rick Mello is hoping the goal of adding seats to the stadium will have a significant effect in the coming years.

"Down the road, we see [Division 1A] in the future, but it's how we do it," said Mello. "We know that football drives revenue and we see it [benefiting] in the future, but things are still to be determined," said Mello, who says that the sales are ahead of pace. 

He also added that Miami is typically a late town, so that could mean sales would increase right before the start of the season.

However one advantage FIU has over a school like UM is that "The Cage" is located on campus, unlike Miami's Orange Bowl, located on the outskirts of downtown Miami.

"Having a football stadium on campus is special because of the campus feeling it has and because of the homey feeling," said Allen.

Added Mello: "Football is the same thing as a fraternity or a sorority. Football gives opportunities to get everyone together and grows every year,"

And on campus, FIU students, who get into games free, are ready to Fill University Park Community Stadium.  

"Football games are amazing. The only place to find school spirit is in "The Cage", because people go crazy [at FIU football games]," said junior Monika Valladares who, as well as senior Mariel Campuzano, went to all of the home games last year.

Both students expect to attend every game this year and see improvement on the horizon for the young team.

"I think the team will be so much better this year just because it's the second year. You don't know what to expect and ticket sales, no matter what the price is, will be worth it," said Campuzano, who adds that seats were full during a few games. 

"There will be a bigger turnout last year than the previous year," said junior Tommy McMillan who expects seeing wins and adds that the team is a worthy addition to an already successful sports program. 

Meanwhile, senior Golden Panther fan William Vance, thinks that the new incoming freshman may present the most spirit. 

"Attendance was low during some of the home games, but the student body understands that it was their first season," Vance said.

The homecoming game is another big game FIU students are looking forward to.

"I hope they can improve their record and win the homecoming game," said freshman Jose Valdez.

The homecoming game should be special this year. Along with NBC televising the game at 10 a.m., the students will enjoy an all night slumber party on the field.    

"This slumber party will start a tradition in FIU," said Allen. "We don't have to be like other schools having the same tradition."

And hopefully, ticket sales can reach its peak and be able to average 15,000 in attendance per game so FIU can move to the next level.

Headline: Kicking it back into gear
Subheadline: Moss, Jones look to rebound after rough opening season
Author: Harry Coleman/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With FIU's kicking game falling short of expectations in its inaugural football season, one of the major focuses of the spring has been to improve all aspects of the special teams- particularly the performances of Adam Moss and Doug Jones.

As a result, Moss, a sophomore kicker, and Jones, a junior punter, have put hundreds of hours on the field during spring practice to get ready for the season opener.

With the offense averaging 21.9 points per game last season, and the defense allowing just a point less at 20.7, the FIU coaches know that one kick can very well make the difference in a game.

"When you talk about football, you don't only talk about offense and defense but also on the special teams. Kicking is a very critical and important part of the game and last year we lost a few games because of missed extra points and field goals," said special teams coach Bruce Hardy.

Moss was responsible for the missed field goals in 2002, making only three of nine attempts and missing four extra point attempts.

But even though the 6'2", 195 pound Moss didn't have the season he hoped for, he'll be the first to admit it, according to Hardy, who credits Moss for learning from his mistakes.

"I'm the first one to admit I did something wrong on the field," said Moss. "If the kick goes out of bounds on the kickoff or I miss a kick, I know why."

"I've been working every other day to focus on perfecting my game," said Moss, who trains every other day to keep repetition and not lose sense of feeling.

Moss' counterpart, Jones, had his troubles as well in 2002, averaging 34.7 yards a punt and converting only one of four extra point attempts.

However, according to Hardy, with a little more practice, Jones is not too far away from reaching the success level he desires.

Moss has taken Hardy's advice, putting in extra work this spring to improve his game.

"I am looking forward to becoming a more consistent punter," said the 5'9", 190 pound Jones who trains every day by running and working out.

But with Jones and Moss having rough debuts, both received their fair share of bashing by Golden Panther fans. 

Instead of letting it affect them, Jones and Moss used the negativity as motivation, driving them to work harder- together.

"We have a good relationship where we stick together after having a real rough first year. We always keep in touch and try to work together to encourage one another to improve," said Jones.

And as kickers, both spend a lot more time with each other than with the rest of the team due to the fact they don't participate in all of the hitting and running drills.

"We are both friends with the rest of the team but because we are both kickers, I know he'll be there for me and vice-versa [because] we understand each other," said Moss.

Added Moss: "On and off the field we are best friends, and always try to help one another when having a bad game."  

According to Jones, Moss was a special freshman last year, and fans will be surprised at what he has to offer this season.

"He's coming back strong. People bashed him a lot but he was one of the few freshmen kicking for their teams," Jones said.

"I took it pretty hard when I missed field goals and extra points because I hate to have that feeling of letting the team down. It was like selling out my team," said Moss.

That's where the support from Jones came in most handy, according to Moss.

"Having Doug as my partner helped me a lot, more than anything else. When I would go to the sidelines and even after bad kicks, he was always there for me," said Moss.

In addition to the guidance they receive from each other, Moss and Jones credit their FIU coaches for being there for them and helping them through their sub par seasons.

"I had a bad first year but [head coach] Don Strock never really gave up on me," said Moss. "He never told me I had a horrible game or kick. He was always a positive reinforcement." 

Jones benefits from Strock's leadership as well, citing Strock's patience as to what makes him a special coach.

"Coach Strock likes to take his time on special teams because he knows it's an important one-third of the game," said Jones.

But just as important has been the instruction from Hardy, whose knowledge and simplicity both players admire and respect.

"Hardy is a real smart guy who knows when something is right or wrong and tries to explain and help us understand even though his strength is not on kicking," said Moss.

Added Jones: "Hardy played in the NFL as a long snapper which has helped him develop my game because he has seen some of the best punt." He is not the person to yell at you but one who wants to get the problems solved," said Jones. 

Besides the FIU coaches, both players have spent time working with outside coaches as well.

Moss, a former soccer player, has worked with his former coaches, Hector Teaghera and Tim Hardaway.

Jones, on the same note, has tried to improve his game by working with NFL Hall of Fame kicker Ray Guy. Guy opened himself up to Jones, working with him on a one-on-one basis for a couple of weekends.

With all the extra preparation taking place, the two best friends seem ready to tackle their next challenge, which begins September 6 against Indiana State.

Moss is now focused on becoming a solid kicker. 

Already in the spring opener, Moss equaled his field goal total from last year by making three of four including one over 50 yards, which is a big step considering Moss' season long was 33 yards a season ago.

Jones maintains he will continue to focus on consistency and will try to exceed his season long punt of 52 yards, orchestrated last year.

So with opening day right around the corner, there are only a couple things left for Moss and Jones to do- silence the critics and help FIU kick their way to a winning season in 2003.

Headline: Tuition increase poor answer to equity, budget cut problems
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
While the tuition hike put into effect by the Board of Trustees July 2 was precipitated by the state's budget cuts - which resulted in about $11 million less funding for FIU - members of the Board of Trustees, and administration pointed out that the decision to exercise an additional increase was due in large part to fears that if the Board turned down the opportunity to generate revenue through tuition, they would lose a chance to attain equitable funding. In effect, the Trustees chose to play a dangerous gambit with student money.

Equitable funding, long a pipe-dream of FIU administrators, means that FIU would receive funding similar to state universities such as University of Florida and Florida State. Their protestations have met with much lip-service, but marginal success.

That is unlikely to change even with this misguided increase in tuition.

That legislators would realize now, after years of argument, that FIU is in dire need of greater state support, which is readily obvious, seems wistfully optimistic. The decision to hike tuition likely will not alter the chances of seeing equitable funding in the near future: Most of FIU's traditional funding competitors - University of South Florida, University of Central Florida, University of Florida - opted for similar tuition increases, maintaining the status quo that has traditionally resulted in FIU receiving less funding than its sister institutions. 

At UF, more than 80 percent of the students receive Florida Bright Futures scholarships, while at FIU, only 13 percent receive Bright Futures.  The UF student body simply will not feel the burden of those tuition increases like FIU's student body will - a student body marked by working and non-traditional students.

One wonders if it may not have been wiser to make more moderate adjustments to tuition and instead plead the case to legislators that FIU is not a conventional university in any sense of the word, and that further increases would be counter-productive (which they very well may be in terms of enrollment, a consideration that many administrators fear), while maintaining that FIU still needs equity.

It's as if those voting for this increase were thinking "me too" instead of actually considering the individual needs of this vastly different university.

Instead, what students are left with, to borrow a phrase from Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of academic affairs, is the worst of both worlds: higher cost without a commensurate increase in quality.

Rosenberg said administration is on a "quest to maintain quality," citing larger classes and fewer course offerings as ways the university can cut costs, while maintaining quality.

Whose definition of a quality education includes higher tuition, larger classes and reduced course offerings?  Certainly not students'.

Witness Mars Approaching Earth

The closest planet to Earth will soon be closer than ever in recorded history, and thanks to the physics department FIU students will be able to get a look first hand.  

The physics department holds a series of public lectures throughout the year, which include "Star parties," where 12-inch telescopes, music, and occasionally food can be found for FIU students and the public to enjoy.  

James Webb, an associate professor in the department of physics and Director of the Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy Observatory, is currently organizing a "Key West Star Party" to be held on July 25.  The telescopes, Jimmy Buffet music, tropical decorations, the stars, and food donated by Publix will be available free of charge to FIU students and the public from 8:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m.  The location is set for the FIU Observing pad in the lawn of the CP building.    Webb, along with the rest of the physics department faculty also plan on having two more "star parties" in August, when according to Webb "the view of Mars will be more accessible."

The telescopes are available free of charge to everyone, and attendance to the lectures are not required to attend the "star parties."

For more information on the lectures or star parties check out the physics department's web page, www.fiu.edu/~webbj/publicprog.html, or contact the physics department at (305) 348-2605.

FIU, National Drug Institute to conduct research 

What better place to conduct research on Hispanics than in Miami; that must've been the thought that the National Institute of Health (NIH) and FIU recently had.  

FIU's College of Health and Urban Affairs is set to open the Latino Drug Abuse Research Center (LDARC) with the help of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a part of the NIH.  FIU will receive a $2.8 million, five-year grant from the Institute to start and operate the center.

"The center not only plans on conducting research but also in training a new generation of researchers who will specialize in the groups that make up South Florida's Hispanic Community," said Mario de la Rosa, an associate professor at FIU's School of Social Work.  De La Rosa will also be the center's principal investigator.

Although some research exists on the patterns of drug usage among Hispanics, many of the studies have focused solely on Mexican and Puerto Ricans.

According to De La Rosa, not only will "[FIU] doctoral students be involved in the training program," but by "the beginning of the [center's] second year, a conference to highlight the research of these doctoral students will be open to the FIU and community at large."

Both the NIH and FIU have high hopes for the center and its intended research.  Said De La Rosa,  "the creation of this center is like planting seeds that will ... shed light on the nature and extent of drug use in [the] Hispanic Population."

Headline: AIDS rate prompts professor's research
Subheadline: South Beach AIDS rate steadily rising
Author: Geannina Munizaga/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The AIDS rate among young gay men in South Beach is rising at an alarming rate - over six times the national average - according to a study headed by FIU public health professor William Darrow.

The study, which was published in the June 2003 issue of the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, grew out of work from a "Research Methods" class Darrow taught in 1996, when the research was initiated. 

It is the first of its kind to specifically target a resort area such as South Beach.

"I used a Socratic approach with my students, asking them how they could find answers to the AIDS problem in Miami," Darrow said. "After targeting South Beach as a high risk area, my students went out to various gay bars and did detailed research."

Results found that South Beach's zip code, 33139, has one of the highest percentages of AIDS cases in the entire United States. The study attributed reasons for such a high rate to circumstances such as the common use of recreational drugs such as ecstasy or cocaine by residents, the openness of sexuality and unprotected sexual activity in the area, and the transient nature of Miami Beach.

According to Darrow, the high volume of visitors South Beach welcomes each year from around the world contribute to the problem; about half a million gay and bisexual men visit the area each year and don't plan to stay for long. 

"The average length of habitation for residents in South Beach is 2 years, and no one lives in the area for more than ten," Darrow said. "I would like similar studies done on other high volume resort areas such as Province Town, Mass. or Far Island, NY."

Although massive educational campaigns sprouted back in the 1980s, the information seems to be falling upon deaf ears in South Beach. 

"Part of the problem is the issue of AIDS and homosexuality gets all mixed up with morality, causing a big dilemma. Unfortunately, unlike European countries, the gay situation is too sensitive for America," Darrow said. "The situation has become worse in South Beach instead of better."

Darrow attributes the high rate of infected SoBe residents to the conservative ideologies of the United States.

"People become offended [in America]. It has been a problem for the past 20 years and was a problem for the past 100 years with other sexually transmitted diseases," Darrow said. "That way of thinking definitely puts an obstacle in front of the education process."

To date there are an estimated 40 million people infected with the disease and the epidemic is expected to double within the next six years, according to the World Health Organization. That means that by 2010, up to 80 million people on the planet will have contracted AIDS.

Darrow has worked in public health for the past 40 years, including a position as the NYC Public Health Advisor in the 1960s. 

"While in New York I worked with different social and cultural groups and the customs that came along with them," said Darrow. "The diversity in New York helped prepare me for the population here in Miami."

Additionally, Darrow is credited for the identification of "patient zero" - the first known person with AIDS - while working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the 1980s. 

The professor and his discovery are depicted in 1987 book by Randy Shilts entitled, "And the Band Played On" which was later made into a movie by HBO.

Presently the professor is conducting research on the Hispanic population in Broward County attempting to eliminate disparities in education, treatment, and acceptance between minorities and whites in the area.

Headline: PRSSA teams up with BP to produce hurricane guides
Author: Lisbertha Eustache/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU students have teamed up with British Petroleum Products, once known as Amoco, to produce hurricane guides for South Florida residents. 

For the tenth consecutive year, FIU's Public Relations Student Society of America has received a grant of $25,000 from their sponsor, British Petroleum (BP), to produce 75,000 pocketsize hurricane guides titled Get Ready, for this hurricane season. The International Hurricane Research Center also provides funding to help produce the hurricane guides.

Get Ready has helped residents in Miami Dade and Broward counties prepare for hurricanes since 1993.

"BP Amoco is proud to continue being part of this very worthwhile project," said Joey Tamayo, local BP Regional Account Executive. "Assisting South Floridians in preparing for the hurricane season is one way BP Amoco can help give back to the community," he added.

Stephen Leatherman, director of the International Hurricane Research Center, helps the student organization develop some of the content in the guides. The guides come in three languages: English, Spanish, and Creole, according to Leatherman. 

The Get Ready guides are on the counters of 167 participating BP Amoco gas stations in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, free to the public. They contain information on how residents and business owners should deal with hurricanes before, during, and after landfall. 

Laura Langlois, the president of FIU's PRSSA, said that some of the additional features of this year's guides include extra pages on tornadoes, floods, thunderstorms, and lightning, which bumped the booklet up from 72 pages to 92 pages.

"Rather than focusing only on hurricanes, Get Ready has included information on other types of storms that are common in South Florida," said Langlois.

PRSSA derived the idea of producing these hurricane guides in the Spring of 1993, after Hurricane Andrew hit South Florida in August 1992. Catherine Ahles, an associate professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication replaced the late William Adams, who supervised PRSSA with assembling the project.

"FIU's PRSSA, part of the Public Relations Society of America, has been nationally recognized for their production of these hurricane guides. It is the only [hurricane guide] being completed by a student organization," Ahles said.

The group celebrated the production of their 1 millionth copy of the guide in 2000. The Get Ready guide also has an online version verbatim to the hardcopy, which is located at http://www.fiu.edu/~getready.

According to Langlois, the Get Ready guide has been endorsed by the Red Cross, National Hurricane Center and International Hurricane Research Center. They are available throughout the summer, while supplies last. 

Hurricane guides like Get Ready have helped some South Floridians better prepare for hurricanes. Charles Burrows, a South Miami resident for 27 years, praises the guidelines contained in the booklets.

"I like that despite its small size, this pamphlet contains so much information on how individuals can prepare their homes and families in the event of a hurricane," Burrows said.

His wife, Sandra, also appreciates the Get Ready guide.

"It's great that it reaches out to the community. I only wish we had this during [Hurricane] Andrew," Sandra Burrows said.

Headline: Trustees raise tuition to max
Author: Lisa Cawley / Editor In Chief
&nbsp;
FIU students will face tuition increases again this fall. 

FIU's Board of Trustees voted to raise tuition to the maximum amount permitted by the state in a conference call July 2.

The state legislature mandated an 8.5 percent tuition increase across the board, giving universities the flexibility to increase tuition by an additional 6.5 percent for all students except in-state undergraduates. 

 FIU administration proposed an 8.5 percent increase for all students, with an additional 2.5 percent increase for undergraduate nonresidents and graduate residents, and an additional 3.5 percent for law school residents. 

But with the exception of Clayton Solomon, University Park Student Government Association president, the trustees rejected their proposal and instead voted to raise tuition by the full amount.

"The main reason for the increase was the concern that if FIU did not raise its tuition to the extent allowed by the state, the state would not later give it adequate funding on the grounds that it did not even use what it was allowed with tuition," Howard Rock, BOT member and Faculty Senate chair, said.  "This was a very difficult decision."

Administration did not recommend maximum increases because they did not want to jeopardize FIU's competitiveness in the marketplace, and they were "worried that our students would not be able to cover the costs," Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of academic affairs, said.

However, Rosenberg said that administration does support the BOT's decision. And while he thinks the situation is unfortunate for students, he believes tuition increases were necessary.

"We need revenue," Rosenberg said. "It's very expensive to run a quality institution of higher education, and so this is a measure that enables us to continue our quest to maintain our quality.

"And while I regret it," he added, "it is something we have to do in order to advance the institution and at least maintain the quality of what we've worked so hard to build."

The total revenue that is expected to be generated from the tuition increases is $7.9 million, according to Charles Tinder, associate vice president for budget and planning. Out of that, about $2.5 million is from the optional 6.5 percent for graduate, law, and nonresident undergraduate students, and the remaining 5.4 million is from the base 8.5 percent increase that will apply to all students.

But that is not enough to completely offset the budget cuts the state handed the university for the upcoming school year.  

The legislature cut FIU's budget by $3.7 million, in addition to not funding the university for enrollment growth (the new students coming in), which accounts for $7.4 million during the 2003-2004 school year; the total loss amounts to more than $11 million.

"The problem is the legislature," Stephen Sauls, vice provost of govermental relations, said. "The legislature did not fund the university. Florida is what is called a low tuition, low state-support state. And so with fairly weak support from the state and fairly low tuition [in comparison to other] states, it creates a very tough problem for a university that's a young, growing university like FIU."

As a result of the budget cuts, the university is also taking other measures to cut costs.  According to Rosenberg, administration is asking faculty to get more research grants, conducting a fundraising campaign to collect donations from alumni, and promoting greater efficiency within the university through larger class sizes, less specialized courses, fewer adjuncts and less courses offered.  

"This isn't just about raising tuition," Rosenberg said. "It's about an overall effort the [university] president has asked us to carry out to maintain quality while cutting costs."

In addition to raising tuition, the BOT also increased the amount of aid the university can grant students through fee waivers from $5 million to $6.5 million. The waivers are distributed on a need basis and Rosenberg said he expects low income and graduate students to benefit the most from the waivers. He added that he expects most of the $6.5 million to be distributed.

With the tuition increase, which only applies to the matriculation component of tuition, the financial aid fee will also increase as a result of a state law that mandates the financial aid fee to be 5 percent of tuition. 

Currently, Florida's public universities rank below national average in all categories of tuition except nonresident graduate.

"Education in Florida is significantly cheaper, and I think it's important that students realize that," Solomon said. "But my argument to administration is that in order to remain the school we are, we have to keep that value."

Headline: Rowling's newest addition leads to obituary
Author: Felicidad Garcia / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
The second war has begun. 

In J.K. Rowling's newest, dazzling installment of the Harry Potter Series, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," the wizarding community, revolving around the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is finally made aware of the evil Lord Voldemort's return to power.

As the definitive coming-of-age volume thus far, Harry, soon to be the-man-who-lived, finally learns the tremendous responsibility of having been the only person to ever have escaped He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and how the grim truth about his future will weigh upon him until the moment that the foretold prophecy about his life (unknown before this book), is fulfilled. 

In molding the personality that will follow Harry into adulthood, Rowling has kept her main character very human, remaining faithful to the common traits that define a growing teen. At fifteen, Harry is impatient, moody, dangerously curious and often times whiney, but still humble and  passionate. That, mixed with his prodigal magical ability, his unfailing courage and some hauntingly prophetic dreams,  make for a hell of an exciting ride through his fifth year at Hogwarts school. 

Yes, Rowling is truly creating a challenge for herself in continuing to raise the bar of reader satisfaction with the advent of each new book. Now, I have to say, I'm pretty partial to book three, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azcaban," where Harry first meets Sirius Black, his godfather (and a fugitive),  as well my favorite character, Remus Lupin. Still, the creation of the Order of the Phoenix, and the fact that it is consistent to some of the most cherished, well-developed characters, really makes this novel the most emotional and pivotal episode in Harry's life. 

The Order of the Phoenix is an organization which was reactivated by the one and only, Albus Dumbledore, with a few original members since the death of Harry's parents, to protect Harryfrom Tom Riddle, the former student turned leader of the dark army known as Death Eaters.

With the introduction of the perfectly horrid Dolores Umbridge, a follower of the "pure blood" mentality, and Hermione Granger's continued efforts with S.P.E.W. (Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare), the theme of equal treatment among all creatures is expanded upon as prejudices against half-breeds such as werewolves, giants and centaurs are brought to light. 

This topic, and all its parallels with the real world, is always a very well portrayed allegory for racism in the books. All sorts of hocus-pocus action occurs as Harry discovers  the meaning of his dreams, as well as infatuation in his adolescence, having his first kiss, with Cho Chang, an old crush. The story comes to a heated climax as Harry's dreams mislead him, sending him and a group of friends, including a strange new character Luna Lovegood, to the Department of Mysteries. Harry has been tricked, through his dreams, into going to save Sirius, whom, he believes, is being held captive by the character with whom he shares a common phoenix's feather. 

Luna Lovegood is hands-down the most intriguing character in the novel. She must be somebody who will be greatly emphasized in volumes to come, seeing as how she has a whole chapter dedicated to her introduction in this one. Teased with the name "Looney Luna," for her eccentricity, her, Harry and Neville Longbottom share the common bond of having witnessed someone die. 

The magical fighting, occurring in the depths of the Ministry of Magic headquarters, is told in a fluid, comprehensible manner so that the reader can catch everything without feeling as if the nail-biting action is being bogged down by the words. Now, I will never be one to reveal a spolier, so I won't mentionwho dies in the dramatic final chapters (which made me bawl like the ending of "Life is Beautiful") or what exactly the prophecy foretold. 

But for those of you who, like me, read the book within the first 24 hours after its release, and therefore already know who's death changes Harry's perspective on life,  The Toronto Star, a daily Canadian newspaper, has published a touching obituary for the passing of the unsaid Hogwarts graduate, which can be seen online at www.thestar.com, under obituaries. 

I expect, because  Harry's character is becoming  more personal to the reader  than in any of the previous books, that the next couple books will be a very careful write for    Rowling. 

And I just pray for her health and safety, because to be perfectly selfish, if anything should happen to her, an attempt to publish the final two books in the British author's voice, a  la V.C. Andrews, simply would not be my cup of tea.

Subheadline: This summer's sequels deliver thrills and fun
Author: Joe Martel/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, 3 stars

Well, he said he'd be back, and after twelve years I would have to say: "it's about friggin time!" Unfortunately, the wait may have been the problem. After over a decade, the whole Terminator craze died down a bit too much. Still, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was well worth the price of admission. However, director Jonathan Mostow (U-571) doesn't quite capture it as well as James Cameron did with the first two, which I consider to be among the greatest films of all time.


So many years have passes since the arrival of the last terminator. With Cyberdyne Systems and all terminator data destroyed, and the fact that the world didn't come to an end in 1997 as predicted, John Connor (Nick Stahl/Bully) can rest a little easier...or so it would seem. Most of his world did end in 1997 when his mother, Sarah, died of Leukemia. 


Never really believing Judgment Day has been avoided, he is now a penniless wanderer trying his best to stay off the radar. Apparently, his paranoia pays off when the T-X (Kristanna Loken/Academy Boyz) arrives on the scene. She is a cybernetic endoskeleton covered with liquid metal. Not only can she change her appearance like the T-1000, but she is also packing some serious futuristic heat. Since the machines were unable to locate John, they sent her back to eliminate his lieutenants, among which is Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), John's childhood friend. 


Fortunately, hot on her time-traveling tail is another T-800 model (Schwarzenegger). He quickly joins up with both John and Kate who are now attempting to prevent Judgment day, which turns out to be much sooner than they realize.


Even after twelve years, Arnold can still do the robot. This was also a good step for him because he hasn't really made a decent movie since 1996's Eraser. T3's biggest difference from Cameron's films is the level of comedy. This one had a few more amusing scenes and yes, I did think they were funny, but no one goes to see the Terminator for a good laugh. All you action fans can stop worrying; both mayhem and destruction are plentiful.




Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, 2 1/2 stars

Taking classic TV shows and turning them into movies seems to be a very popular trend in cinema these days and it's nice to see that director McG (That's his special director's name.) is finally getting it right. After giving us a very disappointing Charlie's Angels, I wasn't going to get my hopes up for the sequel, but after watching Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, I've decided to renew my faith in the franchise.


The angels are back and better than before: Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore), and Alex (Lucy Liu). The office has been rebuilt and everything is brand-spanking new - the furniture, the computer system, and most of all, the Bosley, played by comedian Bernie Mac. I thought the whole bit about him and Bill Murray's Bosley being stepbrothers was a nice touch. 


Upon retuning from a rescue mission of a top U.S. government official from a horde of Mongolians, the girls find out there was a slight problem. They took a special ring from him, one of two that, when combined with the other one, will produce a complete list of everyone in the Witness Protection Program. The other ring just recently went missing and so far five protected people have turned up dead. Their new mission is to retrieve the rings before the perpetrators can auction it off to the highest bidder.


As revamped movies based on classic TV shows go, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is one hell of a trip. I especially enjoyed Demi Moore in her role as "fallen angel" Madison Lee. When it comes to portraying evil, she really knows how to work it, and for a woman pushing forty, she looks absolutely stunning in a bikini. 


My only serious complaint is the return of the Creepy Thin Man (Crispin Glover). As far as I can tell, he had no real purpose in the story. The stunts and special effects, however, did. Full Throttle can best be described as The Matrix meets Sex and the City.

Headline: Anything Goes Anime to host convention
Author: Melissa Greco/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On July 26, FIU's Anything Goes Anime Film Club will be hosting Yasumi Con, a free Japanese animation/Japanese culture convention, in the GC Ballrooms. This is the first convention of its kind to take place on the grounds of FIU and it is South Florida's only free anime convention. 

Much like any other anime convention, it has the typical assortment of anime-related contests and panels, but it also boasts a splash of informative discussions and demonstrations designed not only to entertain the attendees, but also to impart them with knowledge about a culture completely unlike ours. 

Some of the highlighted events include a costume contest, cosplay contest, anime trivia games, webcomics panel and a sushi-making demonstration. 

Guests that are coming from around the South Florida area to host discussions include the Clan Bob comic team (their webcomic can be viewed at www.Clanbob.net) and Mitsutoshi Sekita, the Public Relation/Educational and Cultural Affairs officer at Consulate General of Japan in Miami; members of FIU's Anime Club will also be on hand to lead discussions about what they know the best. 

In addition to discussions and contests, there will be a dealer's area where local vendors will be selling anime-related products. Up-and-coming artists will also have an area in which to show off their artwork. 

Throughout the day there will be a gaming room where people can compete with one another at various video games and anime-related card games. After cooling down from the day's events there will be a nighttime dance party, with music supplied by Dj Kaos. 

"This is the first year for the convention, but we are expecting it to be a blast. If you have the slightest interest in Japanese culture or Japanese animation, you'll have so much fun here," Teresa Montgomery, the event's coordinator for the convention, said. 

If all goes well with this convention, there is hope for it to continue as a yearly event and possibly  as a weekend-long convention like the others that take place around the country.

Yasumicon extends its invitation not just to FIU students, but to anime fans and Japanese enthusiasts all around. "I think Yasumicon is the fruit of the years of hard labor that AGA has put in, but I also think it represents what FIU students can accomplish with the support of their school," said AGA Secretary Alex Perez. 

AGA is also calling in additional support from local high school student volunteers, making the convention a community effort while letting the volunteers share in the satisfaction of putting an event of this scale together. They are all working hand-in-hand to bring a fun and unique event to our school's campus.

AGA hopes that interested parties will show up to check out what is going on and lend support to their fellow students during this event. 

For more information and up-to-date changes and additions to this project, please visit their website at www.yasumicon.com or stop by any AGA meeting; they take place Thursday nights in GC140 from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.

Headline: Current exhibit features two esteemed FIU professors
Author: Isis Iglesias/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This summer, the Art Museum at FIU presents the artwork of two of the most esteemed professors in the Art department who, between them, have 60 years at FIU: Jim Couper and Bill Burke. They are each well-known faculty members who are admired for their hard work and their dedication to their students and the university, as well as their art. 

The pairing of these two artists could not have been more ingenious; and their art could not be more disparate. Couper depicts nature with his masterful brush, capturing, in all its splendor and glory, windswept clouds floating over a golden field; the earth where it meets the sky; the constellations.  

Burke, on the other hand, shows the darker side of life: the inevitable decay and decomposition that awaits all plants, animals and humans. Encased in glass, his gathered specimens are altered and suspended in time, the process of disintegration halted.  

The beautiful glass blocks, and the mysteries they hold, invite a myriad of complex associations.  Dahlia Morgan describes Burke's work as "finely crafted mixed media insights into the ebb and flow of life cycles ... entrancing and startling examinations of biological ephemera."

When Morgan became director of the museum in 1975, both Couper and Burke were already teaching at FIU. She feels they are two of the most accomplished artists in Florida, "They have brought the FIU Art and Art History department to the attention of the whole country."

It is only the second time these two artists have had an exhibit in all these years, but they have been preparing for it for over a year.  Opening night was a warm gathering of people with a common history: colleagues, old friends, students and alumni that have worked or known each other for years.

On hand to witness the festivities was the man who hired them all: Frank Wyroba, the first chair of the Art and Art History Department at FIU.  He reminisced about the old days at FIU and saying, "We had nothing when we came here, I was in a trailer at the end of the campus," while glancing around the room, perhaps in awe at how much the arts have developed at FIU. 

Couper has been teaching visual arts at FIU since 1972, he is now semi-retired and teaches one semester per year. He served as the founding gallery director from 1977 to 1980.

Couper's landscapes are gorgeous representations of nature that also carry a message to the viewer. He paints places with "no trace of civilization." For him, these places not only serve as inspiration, "Nature is where I go for spiritual nourishment, that's it, and really wild nature. I don't go out into tame places. I go out in the thick of the Everglades or the desert or someplace like that."  

These paintings, while beautiful, are not merely pictures of landscapes made to display nature's beauty. They are ecologically-based representations that address modern concerns about our vanishing land resources. 

Couper uses his paintings to show the importance of nature, he paints the landscape he says, "To call attention to it as something, not as a commodity, but as something just inherently valuable and irreplaceable." Couper is quick to point out that while his landscape paintings are not overtly political, he hopes the viewer will take the subject matter more seriously.  

He asserts, "There is another side that I haven't really taken on in a direct way ... and that is the political side of all that because it's being destroyed, particularly right now. I mean this current administration is just a catastrophe ... it's just an absolute catastrophe. I've got a spiritual attachment [to nature] and I'm seeing it being eroded; attacked all the time. And I feel I've got to address it somehow. The war piece was very direct, no question about that; but how to do it with the environment without getting corny, I haven't quite figured out yet how to do that yet."

The war piece he is speaking of is one which might throw most visitors off.  Couper's "Feels Good" installation in the back of the museum, typically approached after seeing his other paintings, stands in stark contrast to his exquisite landscapes. An outright protest to the United States' war-mongering, "Feels Good" is a little off the beaten path for Couper, who quips, "I hope the Governor comes down here and takes a good look and then gets on the phone to his brother."

He enlisted the help of his friend and fellow faculty member Peggy Nolan and she, being more computer savvy than Couper, helped him develop the project. Using images of war printed on classic, white American T-shirts, he addresses a reality that few want to admit.  Couper explains, "It's about the innocent victims of war: the children." "This is the face of war," he points out, "You don't see this in the mainstream press."  

Burke has been a visual arts professor at FIU since 1974. He makes his own art while continuing to teach two classes per semester - ceramics and visual thinking. When asked if any artist served to inspire his work, Burke said no one came to mind, and quickly mentioned his classes, the students by whom he feels so enriched.  

Burke's latest work, a series of self-portraits in lead, is imposing. The large pieces are displayed side-by-side filling the walls with the presence of the human figure.  

The white silhouettes are pressed on thin sheets of grey lead. The large pieces are mounted on wood and lie flat on the wall.  They rise up taller than the viewer and give the impression that they are larger than life, when really they are life size impressions of the artist's own body. 

The fact that Burke is a tall man, well over six feet, adds to this perception of such large scale. 

Burke describes these portraits as a subversion of the art of portraiture. He captures the fleeting illusion of flesh. 

The figure is almost featureless and anonymous, this is not self-glorification or preservation, but rather a serious acceptance of what it means to be encased in the human body. 

Burke's craft deals directly with the elements. 

In his other works, he uses glass and fire to capture the animals of the earth air and water, fish and fowl, flora and fauna. The glass holds the remains of all sorts of creatures, bones and blossoms. 

He explains that "these fragmented objects are but skeletal specters of the forms of nature that they once were, and thus suggest the transience of nature and the ongoing permutations of the natural world."  

He refutes the idea that these pieces are simply about death, "To me they remind me of fossils in amber, x-rays or photographs; they are like the negative of a photograph ... I make them to document life. It's like taking a walk and keeping the beautiful things that I find."  

This exhibit is an oasis from the summer heat; a cool environment in which to vicariously examine nature. 

It will be on display through Aug. 20. 

Admission is free and open to the public; for information on museum hours and upcoming exhibits and events, log on to www.fiu.edu/~museum.

Headline: Dos mil periodistas en la Gran Manzana
Author: Karen Azucena/ Zona Editor
&nbsp;


En Nueva York las agujas minuteras no existen o, quizá, se confunden en el frenesí de sus hermanas segunderas. Esto lo comprobé entre el 22 y el 29 de junio pasados, cuando una semana no fue suficiente para tragarme a borbotones todo lo que esa ciudad y la XXI Convención Anual de la Asociación Nacional de Periodistas Hispanos (NAHJ) me ofrecían a bandeja llena.

Bajo una temperatura que sobrepasaba los 90 grados Fahrenheit, Nueva York coqueteó y terminó conquistando los corazones de los casi dos mil asistentes a la convención, incluyendo a una docena de estudiantes de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida.

Más allá del indomable Times Square, los perros calientes, los musicales de Broadway, las luces neón y la presencia del "Vaquero desnudo" en la calle 42, por una semana Nueva York se convirtió en la meca de los periodistas hispanos, desde los principiantes hasta las "vacas sagradas". Por cierto, estas últimas fueron lo suficientemente humildes como para enseñarnos al resto ciertas lecciones que no se aprenden en las aulas.

La NAHJ organizó un programa estudiantil previo al "gran evento". En el interior del hotel Marriott Marquis, se gestaban un periódico impreso, un noticiero televisivo, un programa radial, un portal de Internet y una serie de talleres y paneles. Algunos estudiantes también tuvimos la oportunidad de visitar The New York Times, la Organización de las Naciones Unidas y la cadena de televisión NBC. 

Pero la emoción del evento solamente estaba comenzando. El viernes, la NAHJ desarrolló un panel sobre la ética periodística y la diversidad con el caso de Jason Blair, ex periodista del New York Times, como tema central. El panel incluyó a Arthur Sulzberger Jr., editor de ese periódico; Macarena Hernández, reportera del San Antonio Express-News y autora de un artículo del cual Blair se apropió para "sustentar" sus notas periodísticas; Condace Pressley, presidenta de la National Association of Black Journalists; y Alberto Ibargüen, director del Miami Herald, entre otros.

Las sorpresas no se detuvieron. El alcalde de Nueva York, Michael Bloomberg, asistió a la recepción de bienvenida en el Museo de Historia Natural. El presidente de la NAHJ, Juan González, presentó, durante un desayuno, el Proyecto Paridad que intenta doblar el porcentaje de latinos en las salas de redacción de los Estados Unidos. Un panel sobre el rol de los medios en el proceso político venezolano encendió los ánimos de los asistentes. John Quiñones, corresponsal de Primetime Thursday y presentador de 20/20 Downtown y Primetime Monday para la cadena ABC, habló sobre los reporteros integrados en las tropas estadounidenses que cubrieron la pasada guerra en Irak. Ciento cuatro empresas periodísticas entrevistaron a periodistas hispanos ansiosos por trabajar.

La lista de lo que me falta por relatar es larga, tanto como los recuerdos de una semana intensa, inolvidable. Por algo Gabriel García Márquez dice que el periodismo es "el mejor oficio del mundo". Seguramente lo reconfirmaré en agosto del próximo año, cuando la NAHJ se una en Washington, D.C., a la National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), la Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA) y la Native American Journalists Association (NAJA), para sorprendernos con el programa de la convención Unity 2004.

Headline: El inevitable ¿y ahora qué?
Subheadline: Awilda I. Castro Suárez

&nbsp;


Más que maripositas en el estómago, muchos universitarios, próximos a graduarse, están sintiendo los aletazos incesantes de pájaros ante la terrible pregunta: "¿Y ahora qué?" 

Y es que esta interrogante es cada vez más frecuente. Muchos saldrán del paso con "estoy analizando varias posibilidades" o "me voy a tomar un descanso." Todo para cubrir esa inevitable nebulosa que se posa en algunas mentes universitarias.

El obtener un diploma universitario es, tal vez, el último empujón para comenzar una vida totalmente adulta. No hay muchas personas que estudien sólo por el placer del conocimiento, sino que estudian para conseguir un trabajo mejor. Este año se graduarán miles de estudiantes y, según los expertos, no todos los campos laborales podrán absorberlos. Esta expectativa puede helarle la sangre a cualquiera incluso al más optimista. 

A este panorama se unen el pago de los préstamos estudiantiles, un matrimonio pospuesto hasta la graduación o la necesidad familiar de ayuda económica. Este listado de presiones puede ser tan largo como las esperanzas de un pobre o la de un universitario.

No importa que en estos momentos la respuesta al "¿y ahora qué?" no sea clara, que las presiones sean interminables y que el panorama sea algo apocalíptico. Lo importante es que sigas intentando vez tras vez, que continúes buscando aunque te duelan los pies, que no desesperes si el teléfono no suena y que sonrías aun cuando la frustración salga por tus pupilas. No sientas vergüenza por tocar una misma puerta dos, tres veces, porque realmente no estás pidiendo que te hagan el favor de darte una oportunidad; sólo estás buscando desempeñarte en lo que eres capaz de hacer y demostrar que tus conocimientos van a enriquecer la empresa a la que entres. Si aquí no te contratan, tal vez en el próximo sí. Hay que tener en mente que la vida no es una carrera de velocidad sino de resistencia: tarde o temprano se llega. Y nunca olvides que cuando una puerta se cierra es porque una ventana se abre.

Según cifras publicadas a finales del 2002 por el New York Times, en un año se acusaron a 1,200 sacerdotes de casi todas las diócesis de los Estados Unidos, 16 de los cuales pertenecían la arquidiócesis de Miami. 

Existían, en ese entonces, 4,268 personas que querían publicidad por abusos sexuales cometidos por sacerdotes en las últimas seis décadas. 

En esta avalancha de demandas, acusados, juicios y culpables, muchas víctimas de abuso sexual por parte de clérigos han decidido ponerle fin a su sufrimiento. No sólo hicieron pública la identidad de sus agresores, sino que también crearon distintas asociaciones de ayuda para aquellos que todavía no se deciden a denunciar el crimen, o que no han podido recuperarse del abuso. Uno de estos grupos se llama es la Red de Sobrevivientes para Abusados por Sacerdotes (SNAP).

"Si usted ha sido abusado por alguien del clérigo, ¡existe ayuda! Somos un grupo de apoyo confidencial e independiente para hombres y mujeres que han sido sexualmente abusados por religiosos. Por favor no siga sufriendo en secreto, silencio y vergüenza. La curación es posible. Contáctenos y reciba la ayuda que necesita y merece. SNAP". Esta es la información registrada en una de las caras del volante que reparten los miembros de SNAP en las puertas de las iglesias, las escuelas y cualquier sitio público donde pueda existir una víctima.

Judy Rakestraw explica las razones por las cuales ella y su equipo reparten estos volantes. 

"El problema existe hace mucho. Ya es tiempo de que la gente se decida a hablar y se haga algo antes de que se sigan abusando más inocentes", afirma Rakestraw.

Hace más de un año, Rakestraw se convirtió en la vocera de SNAP en Miami. La organización fue fundada en 1988 por Barbara Blaine, quien, según Rakestraw, fue abusada sexualmente a los 13 años por el párroco de su iglesia, el mismo que iba todas las semanas a su casa para darle la comunión a su abuela.

El abuso de Blaine se prolongó por cuatro años, al cabo de los cuales ella decidió ponerle fin. Cuando se dio cuenta de lo que realmente estaba pasando, Blaine confrontó a su abusador. El le dijo que Jesús iba a perdonar todo lo que hicieran e iban a ser esposos en el cielo para vivir juntos en la eternidad. Blaine se mostró renuente a continuar con las relaciones sexuales, por lo que el sacerdote, enojado por la decisión, se alejó.

En 1985, luego de leer una historia en el National Catholic Reporter acerca del abuso por parte de un clérigo, Blaine se dio cuenta de que su experiencia impactó profundamente su vida y que necesitaba ayuda. Al hacer pública su historia ante la Iglesia, la respuesta fue que ella había malinterpretado el afecto del sacerdote. Este permaneció en la parroquia donde, según Rakestraw, siguió acosando a otros menores.

Posteriormente, Blaine decidió contactar por medio de abogados y periodistas a todos los que habían sido abusados por clérigos. Creó una red telefónica de sobrevivientes y, en 1988, tuvo su primera reunión con 20 personas que habían pasado por casos similares. Allí nació SNAP.

Un cumpleaños funesto

Hace un año, Rakestraw estaba leyendo un artículo acerca de SNAP en la revista People. Se dio cuenta de que en Miami no existía una oficina de SNAP. Contactó a Blaine y le contó su historia. 

Cuando Rakestraw tenía 11 años, el párroco de su iglesia se hizo muy amigo de su madre, quien tenía muchos problemas con su esposo. Bajo la influencia del sacerdote, la madre de Rakestraw tuvo que afrontar un doloroso divorcio. El sacerdote se convirtió, consecuentemente, en la única guía espiritual de la madre y la hija. Pasaba mucho tiempo en su casa y comenzó a rondar a la muchacha. Cuando cumplió 13 años, afirma

Rakestraw, el sacerdote la violó.

"(Eso) ocurrió en 1959, cuando estos casos de abuso sexual por parte de clérigos no se conocían. Para ese entonces, el sacerdote era casi Dios y nadie dudaba de su buen comportamiento e intachables intenciones. Mi madre le abrió las puertas de nuestra casa, él tenía todo el control y se supo aprovechar de eso", dice Rakestraw con la voz entrecortada. "El monseñor encargado de mi parroquia pensó que este Padre estaba teniendo una relación con mi madre, así es que lo echaron de la Iglesia. Por eso me dejó en paz", concluye ella.

Rakestraw, una mujer de carácter dulce, voz ronca y hablar pausado, dice que las razones por las cuales los menores no denuncian a su agresor, son el miedo y la vergüenza. 

"Es muy penoso, yo era una niña y sentía que era a la única persona que le estaba pasando eso. Para mí él (su sacerdote) era Dios y nunca pude separar al hombre del sacerdote. Estaba aterrorizada y no tenía a quién recurrir", asegura.

En apariencia, su vida transcurría de una manera normal. Rakestraw se casó y tuvo dos hijos. Pero el día en que su niña cumplió13 años, no aguantó más el silencio y decidió buscar ayuda sicológica. 

"El hecho de pensar que mi hija podía pasar por lo que yo viví fue horrible. En ese momento me di cuenta de que tenía que hablar. Le conté a mi esposo y a mi madre, yo no quería herirla, pero ella se culpó por lo que me pasó", afirma Rakestraw.

Cuando comenzó la terapia decidió buscar a su agresor. Contactó a unos agentes policiales de Texas. Ellos la ayudaron a encontrar al sacerdote. Se enteró de que había dejado de serlo hacía 30 años: su agresor se había ido a vivir a California, se había casado y tenía un hijo. Rakestraw viajó hasta allá para confrontarlo. Había escrito una carta 40 años atrás, pero cuando lo tuvo enfrente sólo atinó a preguntarle: "¿Por qué?"

En su caso, el estatuto de limitaciones había caducado muchos años atrás. En términos legales, nada se podía hacer en contra del agresor. De todas maneras, Rakestraw quiso hablar con él. 

"Yo estaba tan asustada, pero necesitaba preguntarle por qué lo hizo. El no dejaba de repetir: 'Siento mucho que se sienta así'. El solo hecho de ver el terror en sus ojos, me dio un poco de tranquilidad. Pero no fue suficiente", dice.

Hoy día, los hijos de Rakestraw son muy religiosos. Su hijo es presbiteriano y su hija es metodista. 

"Yo no he dejado de ser católica, pero nunca pude volver a entrar a una iglesia. Es triste, porque me encantaría asistir con mis hijos a la eucaristía, volver a oler el incienso, sentir esa paz espiritual. Hace unos años fui donde el sacerdote católico Fletcher en Miami, le conté lo del abuso, me confesó y por lo menos dejé de tener pesadillas durante dos años", afirma Rakestraw.

Ella asegura que el problema del abuso tiene que ver con la salud mental del individuo. 

"Es gente enferma que viene a la Iglesia para lavar sus pecados pensando en corregirse. El celibato los trastorna, es una prohibición que los incita a volverse más mañosos. Por eso debería existir un control más estricto en la Iglesia para aceptar nuevos miembros", insiste.

La misión de SNAP es luchar para que el abuso pare, que se termine la impunidad, que se rompa el silencio. Según Rakestraw, lo más grave es que la Iglesia sabe lo que está pasando y, en lugar de echar a estas personas o entregarlas a las autoridades, las transfieren de parroquia o las mandan a Latinoamérica en donde el abuso continúa. 

¿Existe una cura?

Para Rakestraw, el cambio y la solución al problema de la pederastia están en manos de los laicos. Ella está segura de que si la gente le da la espalda a estos abusadores y se decide a acusarlos, finalmente la Iglesia dejará de protegerlos y de pagar sumas millonarias para tapar los escándalos y las demandas. 

Aunque SNAP es la organización más grande de su tipo (cuenta con más de 4,500 miembros), otros dos grupos -The Linkup y Survivors Connections-, adquieren cada vez más atención. El reverendo Gary Hayes, presidente de The Linkup afirma: "Dios debe tener una mano en esto, los obispos no la tienen, así es que debe ser El."

Muchas personas contactan a los miembros de SNAP en los Estados Unidos y Canadá para buscar ayuda. 

"Nuestra misión es escuchar a todos los que han sido abusados por clérigos, hacerles saber que no están solos, que hay otras personas que han pasado por lo mismo, que no tienen la culpa de lo que les pasó y que la curación existe", asegura Rakestraw.

Actualmente, la SNAP está concentrada en promover su organización mediante folletos, conferencias, reportajes y su página de Internet, que contiene las direcciones y los teléfonos de sus oficinas, artículos, consejos para las víctimas y sus familiares y otros recursos para la prevención de abusos y para ayudar a quien lo necesite.

"Estoy contenta con mi labor. Por lo menos puedo darle a otros lo que yo no tuve. El otro día me llamó un hombre de 83 años para contarme que dos de sus nietos habían sido abusados por sacerdotes. El se sentía culpable por lo que pasó, al igual que mi madre, que lleva esta vergüenza y esta culpa por dentro. No sé si algún día paren mis pesadillas, pero por lo menos sé que las personas que nos han buscado, saben que la curación es posible," concluye Rakestraw con una sonrisa.

Causa-efecto

Según Pepe Rodríguez, escritor del libro Pederastia en la Iglesia Católica, la Iglesia ha tenido que pagar muy duro su prepotencia histórica. Rodríguez señala que el sacerdote siempre fue visto como un ser superior por encima del bien y del mal que no podía ser juzgado por las leyes civiles. 

En el derecho canónico existen claúsulas que estipulan que el clérigo debe ser juzgado, perdonado y absuelto dentro de la Iglesia. Además, los obispos deben encubrir cualquier falla en la que incurran sus subalternos. Según Rodríguez, el Papa Juan Pablo II es responsable del código canónico actual que obliga a encubrir a los culpables. 

"El sabe lo que está pasando, pero está tratando de proteger a la Iglesia", declara este escritor.

Pero los escándalos por las demandas han provocado cambios radicales en la historia de la Iglesia católica. El pasado 7 de febrero, el Papa aprobó cambios en la política del Vaticano que acelerarán el despido de algunos sacerdotes acusados de abuso sexual. Además le proporcionarán a los laicos un mayor rol en los juicios que realice la Iglesia a los supuestos abusadores. Esto con el fin de ayudar a los obispos norteamericanos a resolver los peores casos y combatir los abusos.

Pero existe otra razón por la cual la Iglesia se encuentra preocupada. Se está estudiando un proyecto de ley en la sesión legislativa de Tallahassee que pretende acabar con el secreto de confesión como sacramento de la religión católica.

La defensora del proyecto, la representante demócrata Anne Gannon, busca que se pueda abrir el secreto para poder detectar posibles sacerdotes abusadores. Según la abogada Jane Moscowitz, quien tiene varios de estos casos y le ayudó a Gannon a preparar legalmente el proyecto, la medida es interesante porque permitirá descubrir casos que han quedado ocultos. Además se crearía una amnistía de dos años para poder presentar los procesos que han caducado de acuerdo con el estatuto de limitaciones.

El proyecto ha causado la indignación por parte de organizaciones religiosas como La Liga Católica para los Derechos Civiles y Eclesiásticos y la Conferencia Católica de la Florida. Sus representantes afirman que esta es una forma clara de atacar a la Iglesia, y que si la medida es aprobada, van a hacer caso omiso de ella. El temor de la Iglesia es que si se aprueba la norma, se abrirá la posibilidad de revelar otro tipo de secretos de confesión. 

El pasado 10 de junio, Thomas Kelly, arzobispo de la arquidiócesis de Louisville, Kentucky, pidió disculpas públicas a nombre de la Iglesia a todas las víctimas de abuso sexual por parte del clero. La arquidiócesis de su ciudad va a pagar $25.7 millones de dólares a 243 víctimas que ganaron la batall.

En septiembre del 2002, la diócesis de Rhode Island pagó $13.5 millones de dólares a 36 demandantes. Después de ser la precursora del escándalo, la arquidiócesis de Boston indemnizó con $10 millones a 86 víctimas y la diócesis de Manchester en New Hampshire pagó en mayo $6.5 millones a 61 de sus demandantes.

Pero lejos de todas las disputas legales y las millonarias indemnizaciones, la Iglesia tendrá que tomar decisiones radicales y hacer cambios estructurales en su doctrina y en sus leyes, para que el sabor amargo de todas estas demandas, no terminen por destruir el buen trabajo de muchos líderes espirituales.

Headline: Todo por una piel canela: El peligro del bronceado artificial
Subheadline: María de Lourdes García 
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;


"Por sólo $30 al mes puede broncearse todo lo que usted quiera"... Esa es una de las muchas ofertas que ofrecen los centros de bronceado de Miami para atraer clientes, a los que nunca les advierten de los riesgos que tiene para su salud el someterse sin control a este tipo de tratamiento.  

Para las personas que acuden a los mismos, esta oferta es un especial que tienen que aprovechar, ya que le da acceso ilimitado a una máquina que les permite broncearse sin la necesidad de ir a la playa o exponerse al sol.

Lo que no saben estos clientes es que si se someten a más de dos sesiones a la semana, o más de 50 al año, se convierten en candidatos potenciales a un melanoma. Este es un tumor de las células pigmentarias o cáncer en la piel, según lo advierte la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS).

En una investigación realizada en un centro de broceado localizado en Miami, el personal no le advierte a sus clientes sobre las consecuencias, fatales para algunos, del uso desmedido de las camas o lámparas bronceadoras. 

Los clientes, por su parte, ignoran los riesgos a los que están expuestos al someterse a sesiones de bronceado en lámparas que emiten rayos ultravioletas del tipo A, los menos dañinos supuestamente. 

Verónica Moreno es una de las asiduas clientes del Tanning Hut Unlimited, ubicado en la Avenida 137 SW en Miami. La colombiana, de 27 años, recordó que la primera vez que fue a este lugar solamente le informaron sobre las ofertas que tenían disponibles para los interesados en broncearse. Nunca le dijeron que había riesgos en el uso de las camas bronceadoras. Por el contrario, le explicaron todo lo bueno que tenía utilizar la misma.

De acuerdo a una copia del contrato, a la cual se tuvo acceso, las clientas tienen dos posibles elecciones. La primera es el "plan dorado", que ofrece el uso ilimitado de las camas del nivel 1 por el pago de $29.95. En el caso del "plan platino", la clienta tendrá derecho al uso ilimitado de camas del nivel 1 y 2.  Estos números establecen las categorías de las camas de menor y mayor intensidad. 

La OMS aconseja esperar por lo menos 48 horas entre una y otra sesión. Además, establece un máximo de dos sesiones semanales y 50 al año. Los estudios de esa organización revelan que el eventual daño que la piel pueda sufrir va a ser proporcional a la duración de la exposición. También advierte que a más tiempo debajo de su luz, mayor será el riesgo al que estará sometida la epidermis. 

En el centro investigado en Miami, nunca se les dijo a las clientas que tuvieran este tipo de precaución. Simplemente se les dice que al comprar una membresía  mensual o de un año podrán ir al centro a broncearse todas las veces que quieran. En el contrato tampoco aparece información que les alerte sobre el peligro de desarrollar cáncer si usan la cama más de dos veces a la semana. 

Entre las personas entrevistadas se encuentran mujeres que iban al menos cinco veces a la semana. Los especialistas del centro Tanning Hut Unlimited de Miami no les informaron sobre los riesgos que corren de contraer un cáncer. 

Una de estas clientas que iba todos los días a broncearse en estas máquinas es Vannessa Montalvo. Al igual que a Moreno, en ese centro sólo se preocuparon en venderle un contrato. 

"Solo me dijeron cuánto costaba el contrato y la intensidad de las camas", comenta sobre el día en que decidió broncearse artificialmente. La joven de 26 años lleva tres meses acudiendo a este centro de bronceado. 

"Yo, yo iba todos los días. De lunes a viernes y si acaso el sábado me daba la vuelta por allí", comentó Zayda Rodríguez, residente de Kendall y que llevaba más de seis meses acudiendo al referido centro. La joven puertorriqueña, de 29 años reaccionó asustada al enterarse de que las camas bronceadoras no son tan inofensivas como ella pensaba. 

Rodríguez había adquirido el contrato del "plan platino" por un año. Luego de conocer la información sobre los riesgos que tiene el uso de las camas bronceadoras, dijo que va a reducir dramáticamente sus visitas al lugar.  

Por su parte, Moreno no sale aún de su asombro al enterarse, por medio de este reportaje, del riesgo al que estaba exponiéndose ya que frecuentaba el centro varias veces a la semana. 

"Ellos (los encargados de los centros de bronceado) no le explican a la gente. A mí nunca me dijeron nada. He oído conversaciones con otros clientes nuevos y no se lo explican", sostuvo.

La joven solamente llevaba un mes visitando el centro de bronceado, pero se preocupa por lo que pudo haberle ocurrido si no llega a enterarse a tiempo del riesgo de las camas. 

Montero coincidió en que nunca le dijeron que debía esperar un periodo de 48 horas entre sesión y sesión ni mucho menos que el máximo recomendado por las organizaciones de dermatólogos de Estados Unidos y del mundo es de 50 al año. Luego de conocer esta información, Moreno decidió continuar usando las camas bronceadoras, pero siguiendo las recomendaciones de las organizaciones.

La Academia Americana de Dermatología no recomienda el uso de las camas bronceadoras por que pueden ser más peligrosas que broncearse tomando el sol, debido a la concentración de rayos ultravioletas que emiten. Además del envejecimiento prematuro, el usuario de estas camas puede sufrir cáncer. En ese mismo sentido se expresa la Sociedad Americana del Cáncer.

La Federal Drug Administration (FDA), que es la agencia reguladora de las medicinas y químicos en Estados Unidos y el Centro para el Control y la Prevención de las Enfermedades del Departamento de Salud, les pide a los ciudadanos que no utilicen estas camas. 

Montero dice que ella siempre se imaginó que estas camas podían tener algún tipo de efecto nocivo para la piel, aunque creía que eran menos peligrosas que tomar el sol directamente. 

A los efectos ya mencionados, hay que sumarles los daños que les pueden provocar a los ojos si no usa las gafas adecuadas. También, el bronceado artificial puede empeorar algunas condiciones crónicas como lupus y diabetes e incluso si el centro de bronceado no limpia de forma adecuada la cama, de un cliente a otro podrían contagiarse con las llamadas verrugas genitales producidas por el 'Human Papilonavirus'. Este virus es el responsable de la mayoría de los casos de cáncer en el útero reportados en el mundo, advierte la Academia Americana de Dermatología.

El peligro de los rayos ultravioletas

Los aparatos utilizados en estos centros emiten rayos ultravioleta (UV), que son los rayos que emite el sol y que nos broncean cuando los tomamos. Al igual que el tomar el sol en exceso, sin utilizar las cremas de protección indicadas, puede producir distintas enfermedades, el recibir radiaciones de estas máquinas durante más tiempo del recomendado, sin tomar las medidas debidas, también puede producirlas. 

Los rayos UV viajan a la tierra en forma de luz de diversos tipos. Están clasificados en 3 grupos : UVA, UVB y UVC de acuerdo a su frecuencia y energía. Las lámparas de los centros de bronceado artificial emiten rayos UVA.

Según reza en la publicidad y anuncios en los medios de comunicación de estos centros, su producto les permite a las personas cumplir con la moda de estar moreno todo el año sin necesidad de exponerse al sol. Las promociones destacan lo positivo de las camas y se olvidan de lo negativo. 

Los distribuidores de las camas se basan al destacar las bondades de los equipos, en que estas lámparas llevan incorporados filtros muy potentes que eliminan las radiaciones ultravioleta de tipo B, que son las que afectan a la piel en mayor medida y sólo dejan pasar los rayos ultravioleta de tipo A (UVA), responsables de la pigmentación inmediata. 

Pero para organizaciones médicas esta es una verdad a medias. Aunque es cierto que los rayos UVB son más peligrosos para la piel que los UVA, estos últimos no son inofensivos. Los dermatólogos advierten que los rayos UVA están directamente relacionados con las alteraciones del ADN celular, reacciones alérgicas y tóxicas, lesiones tumorales, el envejecimiento prematuro de la piel, la aparición de cataratas y lo que es más preocupante, el cáncer de piel. 

Esto se debe a que los rayos UVA penetran profundamente en la piel y pueden provocar lesiones importantes, desde eritemas, que son las lesiones superficiales, hasta melanomas. Además,  no todas las cabinas se encuentran en buen estado, ni cumplen los requisitos impuestos por el fabricante para su uso, por lo que algunas llegan a emitir también rayos UVB o incluso UVC. 

Un problema creciente

Las estadísticas indican que los casos de melanoma en los Estados Unidos se han triplicado en los últimos 20 años. 

La Sociedad Americana del Cáncer revela que durante el pasado año, 53 mil personas fueron diagnosticadas de un melanoma o cáncer en la piel en Estados Unidos. Se espera que durante el año en curso, mueran 7,400 personas a causa de esta condición.

Una situación que, según los especialistas del Instituto Nacional de la Salud Estadounidense (NIH), no va a mejorar en los próximos años debido, en gran medida, al uso de estas máquinas que proporcionan un bronceado artificial. 

Un informe que publicó recientemente el NIH sobre algunos de los agentes cancerígenos más habituales, revela que a pesar de que el melanoma siempre ha tenido una mayor incidencia entre la población masculina, las mujeres muy pronto van a superar a los varones en este renglón. 

Algunas investigaciones han encontrado cierta relación entre los estrógenos, que es la hormona femenina y la protección natural frente a este tumor de la cara y partes expuestas al sol directamente. 

Pero estos estudios apuntan que si bien es cierto que la mujer tiene esta defensa, el hecho de que la población femenina sea la que acuda con más frecuencia a los centros de bronceado artificial para tomar sesiones de rayos UVA podría llevarlas a  perder su escudo frente al melanoma. 

De acuerdo a la Fundación para la Prevención del Cáncer en la Piel, la industria de las camas bronceadoras es una que cada día crece más y que anualmente genera alrededor de $2 mil millones en los Estados Unidos. Alrededor de 28 millones de estadounidenses van a los más de 25 mil lugares en donde se ofrecen estos servicios.  

La controversia sobre las camas bronceadoras tiene su origen en 1994, cuando la Asociación Médica Americana adoptó una resolución rechazando la venta de estos equipos para fines cosméticos y solicitó que limitaran su venta a fines médicos. Sin embargo, la United States Federal Trade Comission, que es la agencia gubernamental que podía tomar una decisión sobre el asunto, no dio paso a la solicitud. 

Los estudios lo confirman

Según la doctora Marie-France Demierre, de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Boston, la mayoría de las usuarias de lámparas de bronceado se expone al mismo tipo de rayos que produce el sol, por lo que es lógico pensar que estos aparatos no son tan inofesivos como pueden parecer. 

Un estudio realizado durante el 2002 por la Darmauth Medical School, publicado este año en la revista 'The Journal of the National Cancer Institute', estableció que el someterse a sesiones frecuentes de bronceado artificial hace más propensas a las personas a ser diagnosticadas con cáncer. 

El doctor S. Spencer, dermatólogo de la institución presentó los resultados de una encuesta entre 1,500 personas, 800 de las cuales fueron diagnosticadas de cáncer cutáneo, que es un cáncer en la cara. Las otras 700 personas no tenían esta condición. 

La encuesta mostró que las personas que usaban el bronceado artificial tuvieron un riesgo 2.5 veces mayor de desarrollar una forma de cáncer de piel conocido como carcinoma de células escamosas, que le da apariencia de escamas a la piel y 1.5 de un carcinoma basocelular. Este ataca la doble capa que protege a las células del organismo.

Si además de mujer, la persona que se somete a sesiones frecuentes de bronceado artificial es adolescente los riesgos son mayores, de acuerdo al mismo estudio.

"Las lámparas de bronceado imitan la luz del sol y proporcionan una intensidad similar, concentrando la dosis de rayos ultravioleta por lo que podríamos predecir que las personas que utilizan estos aparatos pueden llegar a tener cáncer de piel", explicó Margaret R. Karagas, profesora de medicina de familia y directora asociada del centro.

Los usuarios de estas lámparas suelen sufrir quemaduras como las producidas por el sol, relacionadas con el riesgo de tres tipos de cáncer de piel: el melanoma, el de células basales y el de células escamosas. 

El hecho de que el bronceado artificial se haya puesto de moda, en especial entre los adolescentes y los adultos jóvenes, podría tener consecuencias dramáticas, dijo Karagas. 

Pero este no es el único estudio que confirma el riesgo de las camas bronceadoras. Una investigación realizada por el profesor Martin Weinstock de Brown University Medical School refleja resultados similares. 

El estudio fue publicado en la revista 'Journal of the National Cancer Institute' e indica que las personas que usan las camas son propensas 2.5 veces más a contraer cáncer celular que las personas que no las usan. También concluye que los usuarios pueden desarrollar un carcinoma 1.5 veces más que los no usuarios. Finalmente, el estudio confirma que mientras más joven comience a exponerse a estos equipos, más propensa es la persona a desarrollar las condiciones antes indicadas.  

Condiciones del equipo

A pesar de las promesas de seguridad que hacen estos centros, no hay mecanismos de ley que los obliguen a rendir cuentas sobre la forma en que operan y si el equipo que utilizan está en condiciones óptimas. 

Muchas veces hemos oído hablar de la capa de ozono y su importancia. Los rayos ultravioleta C no llegan hasta la tierra gracias a la capa de ozono. Si llegaran, podrían causar quemaduras en nuestra piel. A eso se expone una persona que se somete a un bronceado con una lámparas defectuosa.

Informes de 'Archives of  Dermatology', la revista de la Asociación Médica Americana, indican que con el paso del tiempo estas máquinas suelen perder sus filtros protectores y empiezan a emitir cantidades excesivas de rayos UVB, que son sumamente peligrosos para la piel. Incluso, si sufren averías o su mantenimiento es incorrecto, estos aparatos pueden producir radiaciones ultravioleta de tipo C. 

En ese sentido se expresa la Sociedad del Cáncer de Nueva Zelandia, un país donde el cáncer de piel y otras condiciones representan una preocupación diaria, ya que el agujero de ozono está situado sobre este territorio. Advierte que el cliente no tiene manera de conocer si la máquina que está utilizando cumple con las normas o no. No hay garantías, sostiene la organización.

Finalmente, tal y como denuncian los dermatólogos, el personal que maneja estas camas, cabinas y lámparas suele carecer de los conocimientos mínimos de fotobiología y dermatología. La primera ciencia es el estudio de los efectos de la luz sobre los seres vivos y la segunda es la rama de la medicina que trata de las enfermedades de la piel.

Headline: Bush needs to cooperate with Senate in appointing Supreme Court justices
Author: Edward Kennedy/ Special to the Washington Post
&nbsp;
In my years in the Senate, I've served with nine presidents, Democratic and Republican, who have nominated 20 justices to the Supreme Court. 

Some of these nominees were confirmed by the Senate by a unanimous vote or by an overwhelming majority. Others lost by an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. Some won only after a successful vote for cloture to end debate, and one withdrew after losing a cloture vote. 

The process has not always been contentious. When presidents understand and respect the constitutional "advice and consent'' role of the Senate on judicial appointments, the process can be smooth and cooperative, especially when the president obtains and heeds the Senate's advice before requesting its consent on a nominee. But when a president tries to ignore the Framers' careful decision to have the Senate share the appointment power, then the responsibility the Framers placed on us may require us to stand up to the president, and over the course of the nation's history the Senate has done so when necessary. 

Thomas Jefferson tried to remove a justice whose opinions he did not like, but the Senate refused to cooperate. FDR tried to expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court to keep it from rejecting his New Deal programs, but the Senate refused. Lyndon Johnson nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be chief justice, but Senate conservatives used a filibuster to slow his confirmation until he withdrew. Richard Nixon, upset at the Senate's rejection of one Supreme Court nominee, tried to strike back by nominating a clearly unqualified second candidate. But the Senate stood its ground. Ronald Reagan nominated Robert Bork, and the Senate defeated him. 

Throughout this history, the Senate has been able to stand up to the executive branch because our constitutional structure of government and the Senate's rules permitting extended debate have made the Senate the world's most successful deliberative body. Until 1949, Senate debate on nominations was unlimited. From 1949 to 1975, the Senate could end debate if at least two-thirds of the senators wanted to. Since 1975, if at least three-fifths agree, the debate can be ended. 

The nation was closely divided on President Bush's election, and the Senate is almost evenly divided today. In making his most important judicial choices so far, the president has rarely consulted with Democratic members of the Senate to select nominees who will have broad, bipartisan support. Even so, the vast majority of the president's nominees to the federal courts have been confirmed - 131 of the 133 who have reached the Senate floor. Only two have been held up - one on the merits and one for procedural reasons. 

The president has not yet faced the challenge of making a Supreme Court nomination. He does have one unfettered choice: He can choose either the path of genuine consultation with the Senate, as intended by our constitutional system of checks and balances, or the path of confrontation with the Senate. He can bring the Senate and the nation together, or he can throw red meat to his fringe constituencies by making a divisive nomination. We may know his choice very soon. 

I hope that he chooses the same path of cooperation that has allowed us to make progress on other key issues, such as school reform and Medicare. 

- Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts, is a member and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Headline: Government must reconsider deployment of the Army
Author: Michael O'Hanlon/Special to the Washington Post
&nbsp;
After criticizing the Clinton administration for over-deploying and overusing the country's military in the 1990s, the Bush administration is now doing exactly the same thing - on a much larger scale. Hordes of active-duty troops and reservists may soon leave the service rather than subject themselves to a life continually on the road. Much more than transforming the armed forces or relocating overseas bases, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld must solve this problem before the Bush administration breaks the American military. 

The problem is most acute for the Army. While most Marines, sailors and Air Force personnel go home to a grateful nation, the Army still has more than 185,000 troops deployed in and around Iraq. Another 10,000 are in Afghanistan. More than 25,000 troops are in Korea; some 5,000 are in the Balkans; and dozens here and hundreds there are on temporary assignments around the world. Nearly all of these soldiers are away from their home bases and families. 

This total of nearly 250,000 deployed troops must be generated from an Army of just over 1 million. The active-duty force numbers 480,000, of which fewer than 320,000 are easily deployable at any given moment. The Army Reserve and Army National Guard together include 550,000 troops, many of whom already have been called up at least once since 9/11. 

Deployment demands are likely to remain great, even if Rumsfeld and Bush hope otherwise. The Pentagon is lining up 20,000 to 30,000 allied troops to help in Iraq come September, from countries such as Poland and Italy and Ukraine. Unfortunately, as recent events underscore, the overall mission is still likely to require nearly 200,000 coalition forces. That means 125,000 to 150,000 U.S. troops could still be needed for a year or more--with 50,000 to 75,000 Americans remaining in and around Iraq come 2005 and 2006 if experience elsewhere is a guide. 

As a result, a typical soldier spending 2003 in Iraq may come home this winter only to be deployed again in late 2004 or 2005. The typical reservist might be deployed for another 12 months over the next few years. These burdens are roughly twice what is sustainable. The problem is so severe that we must approach it from several angles: 

* Temporarily add 10,000 to 20,000 more troops to the Army. However, this is such an expensive solution--and takes so long to implement, given the challenges of recruiting and training--that other measures need to be adopted as well. 

* Approach a broader range of allies, especially larger countries such as France and Germany and even Japan and South Korea, for substantial troop contributions. Each of these countries can provide roughly 5,000 troops; we should also be able to solicit more help from those South and Southeast Asian states with peacekeeping experience. 

* Make the Marine Corps a full partner of the Army in peacekeeping, not just fighting. This means substantially reducing the Marine Corps presence in Okinawa; it also means asking Marines to accept a temporarily higher global deployment pace themselves - possibly including a small mission soon in Liberia as well. (Even though they're not perfect substitutes, we could ask the Navy and Air Force to increase East Asia deployments temporarily to compensate for reduced Marine Corps presence.) The Marines should be able to sustain 15,000 to 20,000 personnel in Iraq. 

* Make a higher percentage of Army troops deployable. This isn't easy, given the need for numerous stateside functions, but certain activities, such as mid-career education, can be suspended for a year or two. The Army is in crisis, and it needs to take radical measures as a result. 

* Finally, as Rumsfeld and Gen. James Jones of European Command draft their plans for relocating many American forces from Germany, they need to bear the over-deployment problem in mind. Rather than creating new facilities where troops are sent primarily on temporary assignments, they should try to establish new bases in Eastern Europe that permit troops to bring their families. 

It would be the supreme irony, and a national tragedy, if after winning two wars in two years, the U.S. Army were broken and defeated while trying to keep the peace. Unfortunately, the risk that this will happen is all too real.

Author: John Colagrande Jr./ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Two things: Jose Canseco and those radio disc jockeys at El Zol. 

First, the radio DJs, Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero, of 95.7 El Zol. 

How cool are they? They got Fidel good this time. To prank call Fidel Castro, man, not only does it show skill to mastermind the plot, they have cojones the size of watermelons. 

Recently, the two DJs pretended to be aides of Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan president. To lure Fidel on the phone the deejays spun a lie that Chavez had left a briefcase with "sensitive documents" in an Argentina hotel where Castro and Chavez recently were together. Fidel Castro got on the phone and said the situation would be fine. Then Santos yelled, "are you fine with the s--- you've done on the island, assassin?" Gotcha. 

Fidel was angry and embarrassed. He started cursing like a madman. All for our listening pleasure. Now that's entertainment. 

Prank masters like the Jerky Boys and the popular Comedy Central prank show "Crank Yankers" pick on innocent people to derive entertainment. 

Santos and Ferrero have elevated the prank call into a whole new genre. They've inserted justice into the entertainment prank. By pranking Castro - they also pranked Chavez in January - they've created the Just Prank, and not only that, they've penetrated the political infrastructures and defenses of oppressive regimes so easily. It shows that the governments are weak, or at least it shows that they are a joke. 

They should prank Kim Jong Il, the leader of North Korea, next, or Saddam, if they could find him. But, for real, props to Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero, they should be applauded and celebrated. 

On the other hand, there's Jose Canseco. 

Canseco is in some serious doo-doo. He can't stay out of trouble. Canseco was on house arrest in Davie when he violated his probation by testing positive for steroids. 

He's going away. He's going away, for sure.

You don't mess with Broward County. You don't do it. The cops and the judges up in Broward have some serious issues with power and control. It's definitely true that Miami cops and the whole Miami judicial system are more relaxed than Broward's. Canseco's a goner up there in Davie. 

Do you know what Canseco was doing while he was on house arrest? He ran an ad on his website: for $2,500 any regular Joe could've spent a day with him at his house. Personally, I think that was a shrewd move, make a little money anyway possible, it's a hustle move, but I don't think the judge is going to see it as shrewd. 

The judge, who already warned Canseco not to violate his probation, is going to see the hustle move as taking advantage of the system and it is possible that Canseco will be looking at some serious time. 

This Jose Canseco issue is very relevant to FIU. 

Outside the University Park campus there is a road named after Jose Canseco, 16th street off of SW 107th Ave. 

Sixteenth street is Jose Canseco Drive. It's also the entrance to our school. 

You know the story: hometown boy makes good so you name a road after him. 

Fine. Canseco won a World Series. He was an MVP. He hit, like, 460 home runs. 

Why are we naming roads after him again? He's a criminal. He's not a martyr. He's a wife beating, cocky, drug shooting criminal. 

And so what about his accolades? First off, he admitted he was on steroids during his baseball career, and he's said he is going to write a tell all book about steroid use in the Majors. 

To me that's a sign of the man's character, he's a rat, he's a rat and a hustler. He'll have time to write his book in jail, that's for sure. 

And if Canseco is such a Miami darling, then why is he living in Davie now? Forget Jose Canseco. 

If FIU has any jurisdiction over the name of that road then the powers that be should change the name immediately. Changing the name now is an opportunity to bring positive press coverage to our school, and if the powers that be were smart they would know this and be doing something about it. 

It is a complete embarrassment for a road named after a washed up athlete and criminal to be the entrance to any institute of higher learning let alone our school. 

Might as well name the road O.J. Simpson Drive. He lives in Miami now. 

This road needs to have its name changed before the Fall semester. Our school cannot go out like that. 

They should name the road Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero Way. That'd be straight. Or maybe just keep it 16th street, or how about FIU Lane, after all, it is the entrance to our school. 

Anything but Jose Canseco Drive.
