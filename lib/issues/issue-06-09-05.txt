Headline: BUDGET BLUES
Subheadline: Students find creative ways to save money
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
College students have a reputation among older adults for being poor and starving, subsisting on a consistent menu of tuna, soda crackers and ice water. If one takes into account the world's whole population, it's an insensitive exaggeration to say the average American student is actually "poor" or "starving." But there's no denying that most are on low budgets thanks to a substantial tuition increase in the average four-year public college.

More students are working full or part-time to pay tuition, but only getting about $7.50 an hour. So, like tuition, student debt has also gone up dramatically, which when combined with low wages is a recipe for a low budget. 

However, another factor in our low financial status is that many students don't really know how to manage money. Many find it a struggle to spend efficiently, especially while on campus.

Senior Psychology major Kristin Barnes rations her money conscientiously because it's her goal to be as financially independent from her parents as possible. But she admits she hasn't always done so.

"One of the things I had difficulty with was restaurants on campus," Barnes said. "Taking the cost into account is hard when you're on the go; bringing snacks from home helps me keep track of where my money's going." 

Barnes' words resonate with those who know just how much a Subway meal here and a frappuccino there can add up. 

According to Business First, overspending on food is one of students' most frequent financial mistakes. Other top-ranking ones are entertainment, ignoring gas prices and, of course, the pitfalls of credit cards. 

Toby Disbrow from the University Credit Union emphasizes both the danger of credit cards and the importance of saving up for the future. 

"Don't get involved with too many credit cards; stick to one," Disbrow advises. "Pay yourself first if you want to save. Sign up for automated deductions for a savings account. This is called earned income averaging."

Another way students can make their small income stretch is to take advantage of free offers on campus. Many FIU students are already well-aware of this technique, considering the Facebook groups "I Go to FIU for Money" and "I Get My Entire Wardrobe for Free from FIU." 

By doing a little legwork and finding out just what's happening on campus, some students manage to save money by tapping into the many resources FIU has to offer. Club meetings, career fairs, GC booths and credit card offers - all can be potential sources of free items, especially food and T-shirts. Accounting sophomore Roberto Van Dalen has it down to a science.

"For school supplies, make sure you raid information tables the first week of class. In the school buffet, leave with a snack and stash it. Don't spend money on a novel for class; read it in the second floor of the bookstore," Van Dalen said. 

But while everyone enjoys free offers, do students have reason to be suspicious of them? Is there really such a thing as a free lunch? Certainly lunches and T-shirts offered by clubs are harmless enough, but perhaps not when it comes to credit card promotions. 

Barnes recalled one instance when she was hungry on campus with no money left and came across a credit card company offering a sandwich for those who signed up. Her father later questioned the logic of her giving in and signing up, asking her, "Don't you realize that it costs you a lot more to have your credit report affected than to buy your sandwich?" Certain free offers are only short-term and may end up being more costly in the long run. 

Van Dalen said his overall financial philosophy is, "If you don't need it, don't buy it." Unfortunately it's not always clear what exactly constitutes a need, but it is nevertheless a cost-effective motto to live by.

Headline: Under the Radar: The Ombudsman
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
You've heard of him at your orientation. You've probably unknowingly passed his office several times when walking through the second floor of the Graham Center. He co-wrote the First Year Experience textbook. But who (and what) is the University Ombudsman?

Larry Lunsford has been the University Park Ombudsman for eight years. 

A Swedish word meaning "agent" or "deputy," the Ombudsman has the duty of hearing and resolving students' concerns. Whether you have a big problem or a simple question, the Ombudsman can help.

"The last thing students want is a run-around," said Lunsford. "If they need an answer, I'll give it to them." 

According to Lunsford, Florida requires that each state university has an Ombudsman. Last year, Lunsford resolved 441 different cases. In 2004, he dealt with the most cases ever: 570.

When hearing a case, Lunsford sorts it into one of two categories: academic or administrative. The academic category includes anything from academic dismissal to conflicts with professors. The administrative category is comprised of topics such as immunization and financial aid.

Regardless of what category a student's concern falls under, the Ombudsman cannot be partial in a conflict.

"I am designated as a neutral person by President Maidique," Lunsford said. 

Because he has to remain impartial, Lunsford does not directly solve problems. Instead, he refers students to the office or individual who can help them with their issues. Nevertheless, once the Ombudsman is involved with a case, the problem must be solved.

"If students are frustrated and don't know who to turn to for help, they should come to me," said Lunsford.

Not all dilemmas are solved to students' satisfaction, though.

"My position doesn't have room for bias," said Lunsford. "Students will get an answer, but it may not be the one that they want to hear." 

Resolving a problem can take as little as a few minutes to a couple of years.

"Students have come in and I've helped them fix their problems the same day," Lunsford said. "In extremely rare cases, the problem has taken two or three years."

Any student who confronts the Ombudsman with a problem is assured confidentiality. 

"I can only identify a student with his or her permission," said Lunsford. 

Aside from helping students with their conflicts, Lunsford visits First Year Experience classes and speaks at training programs about various university topics.

Despite the different services the Ombudsman offers, students like sophomore Shane Phen are unaware of who the Ombudsman is.

"I've heard of him, but I'm not really sure of what he does," said Phen. "I've never visited him."

With more than 37,000 FIU students, the difference between the number of cases Lunsford oversees and the number of students at the university seems lopsided.

Lunsford cites two reasons for this difference: students' lack of knowledge about his role and the service provided by the various departments on campus.

"Either students aren't aware of my services, or the different departments are doing an exceptional job at solving students' issues the first time around so there really isn't a need to see me," he said. 

Regardless, Lunsford admits that students should know the rules of the university.

"With 38,000 students, it's impossible for students to be informed of rules on an individual basis," he said. "Students are responsible for knowing which rules apply to them."

There are three ways to contact the Ombudsman - you can call him at 305-348-2797, email him at Lunsford@fiu.edu, or visit the office of Vice President for Student Affairs on the second floor of GC in room 219.

Headline: Dealing with embarrassing situations
Subheadline: How to...a humor column
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Some people are born to shmooze. They coast through life, being able to get out of late assignments, traffic tickets, club covers or spousal fidelity for years on end. 

You'll notice them in front of you in the hall, as they stop to say hi to everyone in their path, undoubtedly making you late for class. They have no enemies, and if you asked anyone's grandmother, they'd be considered buena gente.

For the other 97 percent of us out there, life and its interactions aren't that easy. Throughout your life, you'll probably stick your foot in your mouth plenty of times, and if you're like me, offend more grandmothers than you thought you could in one lifetime. Awkward situations will happen where you or someone you know will straight up look like an ass.

Here's how to recognize and deal with some classic awkward moments with the most dignity and grace you can muster.



The Bad Compliment



"Despite calling attention to the acne on your face, I really like that red lipstick."

"You look great with all that lost weight even though your skin sags a lot now." 

"Your boyfriend/girlfriend is really cute once you get past that sloping forehead thing."

People are jerks. Some feel they have to qualify nice statements by, naturally, dunking them in venom. Regardless of luck, you'll receive a backhanded compliment at least once in your life. With hope, you'll get a "no, no, I didn't mean…" but more likely a blank stare that means, "Did I do something wrong?"

If you're thick skinned or have a good sense of humor, you can simply respond to the offense. Or, because clearly no one taught this person manners, you can use the opportunity to educate. Keep a spray bottle with water in it near you at all times. If the situation calls for it, spray twice and scream, "No! Bad kitty!"  At worst, they walk away. At best, they walk away and start using the litter box. 



Running Into the Ex



There's nothing better than running into someone who's broken your heart and seen you naked. It brings up a special kind of hatred that makes you feel all of your organs. Usually it will happen when you haven't showered or had any coffee after being up for 28 hours writing a paper. The ex, however, will be meeting the new love for sushi and chai lattes after leaving the salon.

The best advantage to this situation is, if you knew the person well enough, to go for all weaknesses. Beat the awkwardness to the punch. "How's the ingrown toenail?" or "How's the hamster phobia going?" are good starters. If you are met with a similar response, segue into how you're late for your (insert complicated subject you know nothing about) class and exit.



The Morning After



Alcohol can facilitate strange situations, the peak of those being your stale lover waking your roommate to ask if she's seen his pants. 

Generally, there's no good way to say, "Thanks for last night, get out."

I've always felt there should be some sort of system where prizes should be given according to the previous night's performance.  No words need to be exchanged, simply hand the guy or girl a $5 gift card to iTunes over breakfast. If it wasn't so great, a consolatory fruit basket with a "Better luck next time" enclosure card is a good way to go. If anything, your mistake can eat it on the way home. 



The Silence



Probably the most common awkward moment happens after you make a bad joke or reveal something you shouldn't. It's met with silence. 

Hopefully you've learned that awkward situations only occur if you make them occur. Embrace the awkwardness. When you make a bad joke, boo yourself. You can only make things better. Or worse. It's either way. Good luck.

Headline: Brit band's sophomore release hits, then misses
Author: Jose de Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Artist: Razorlight 
Album: Razorlight
Release Date: July 18, 2006

Heroin addicts often describe their drug abuse as a series of attempts to recreate the experience of their first high. Subsequent fixes are sometimes frustrating, sometimes thrilling, but they never measure up to the ecstasy of that first time. 

To experiment that same sensation for yourself, try giving Razorlight's new self-titled album a listen or two. The album opens with "In the Morning," a perfect single, the kind you listen to in the car that makes you  want to roll the windows down and drive fast.  The song features the catchiest guitar riff heard in months, the drums drive forward at a brisk, euphoric pace while frontman Johnny Borrell delivers the vocals with just the right amount of attitude. Just listen to it once and try not to grin like an idiot. 

Borrell's voice is in top form on this record, the instrumentation is flawless and the production is airtight. Upbeat tracks like "Before I Fall to Pieces" and "Back to the Start" make this a fun album, and the record closes wonderfully with the cathartic "Los Angeles Waltz." 

However, after the opening track, the record fails to produce any truly memorable songs. None of the subsequent tracks manage to reproduce the play-on-repeat catchiness of "In the Morning." 

Razorlight's previous release, their debut album titled Up All Night, was an explosive album, brimming with vitality. It featured feel-good tracks tinged with rage and bitterness, with perfect hooks and manic lyrics. 

Aside from the opening track, Razorlight's new album lacks any of the stand-out gems that made Up All Night such an addictive record. None of the new tracks have the melancholy  of "Golden Touch" and "Don't Go Back to Dalston," or the rock-out recklessness of "Rock n' Roll Lies." 

As a young band, Razorlight still seems to be trying to find their sound. In Up All Night, Borrell rambles viciously, Lou Reed-style, against raucous guitars and tight percussion arrangements. Their new album sees the band taking on other influences. 

"Who Needs Love?," the album's second track, with its one-handed piano accompaniments and slow, simple verses, could easily belong on a Ben E. King or The Platters best-of album. On "Hold On," they try their hand at 60s pop. "Back to the Start" references The English Beat and the overwrought "America" smacks of Supertramp. 

In some cases, they manage to pull off these stylistic experiments, while some other attempts simply fizzle out.  Overall, however, Razorlight's gratuitous genre-hopping makes this a much less cohesive album than their previous release.

&nbsp;
Artist: Matt Ward   
Album: Post-War
Release Date: Aug. 22, 2006

Matt Ward's fourth album is his best one yet. Produced by Ward himself, Post-War has a crispness and sonic depth about it, each track blending seamlessly into the next with perfectly layered vocals and atmospheric lo-fi quality that's never grainy. 

His singing has a presence that brings to mind jazz vocalists - someone as unearthly as Billie Holiday, even - but also the grittiness of a deep-South bluesman. No one else sounds like him.

Several tracks featuring guest vocalists Jim James (of My Morning Jacket) and Neko Case further enhance Post-War's uniqueness, providing energy and fullness in all the right places. On other songs like "Magic Trick"- given more of a live feeling through crowd noise - and the Daniel Johnston cover "To Go Home," there's a strong sense of community, of musicians having a good time playing music together.

Those good-vibes moments combine with the title Post-War to suggest a rebuilding after hard times, a looking toward tomorrow. At the same time, the album carries a heavy sense of the tough times themselves. The title track feels like the most cogent expression of these themes. Ward sings slowly, deliberately, investing each word with meaning when he sings of the feeling that everything has gone wrong, but also when he swings the other direction. His voice is wistful, hopeful, as he sings, "I'll know when everything feels right / Some lucky night." 

It'd be wrong to mischaracterize the album as "about war" or about any one other topic, especially considering the album's "variety-show" mood, which can easily drift from a folk sing-along jam to a surf-rockish instrumental to glowing, almost jazz-like ballads. 

The album opens with a patient, out-of-time love song called "Poison Cup" and includes a few other equally haunting ballads about the search for love. "Chinese Translation" has a lazy, rolling-along mood, and with perhaps the album's most memorable melody ­- a delicately sung one - tells of a search for answers, about heartbreak and getting beyond pain. 

In composition and performance, Ward displays an ear for the hallmarks of so many American music genres. Yet he finds a way to blend them all together into a personality of his own. Post-War showcases that personality succinctly and brilliantly, while also opening up his music to the outside world, to its troubles and its charms.

Little Miss Sunshine:
You'd be hard pressed to find a better film in theatres than Little Miss Sunshine. This film is the best ticket in town. 

Now, you may be asking yourself what makes this film so interesting and good. Check this scenario out: How many feel-good, upbeat, family comedies have you seen that include drug addiction, suicides, depression and death?

Husband and wife directing pair Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris have had a long and illustrious career in the music video business (The Smashing Pumpkins' "Tonight, Tonight" being their magnum opus), and their first venture into feature film-making couldn't be a grander success.

The film was the talk of the Sundance Film Festival where it was bought by Fox Searchlight Pictures for a record $10 million dollars.

I can clearly see why. 

The film's strength lies in its funny, often touching screenplay and in the charming performances by its award winning cast, which includes Steve Carrell, Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette, who are all upstaged by 10-year-old actress Abigail Breslin.

Breslin, who made her debut in Signs is absolutely wonderful in the role of Olive, the little girl at the center of the Hoover family. 

Little Miss Sunshine begins its tale when Olive unexpectedly finds herself a contestant in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.

Once she wins the spot, it's up to her dysfunctional family to drive her from New Mexico to California.

Her family comprises of failed motivational speaker Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear), Mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) who seems to be the only sane person in the household, and Brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), who has vowed not to speak until he is admitted into the Air Force. 

Also along for the ride are suicidal, gay Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) and Grandpa (Alan Arkin) who spends most of his time snorting cocaine and talking about the number of women he's slept with. 

However, there are plenty of serious moments in the film as the dynamics of a dysfunctional family are dealt with in a very realistic way.

As mentioned earlier, suicide, death, and drug addiction are all serious issues that come into play in the film. 

But it's the heart of the film that triumphs over all. 

If this film doesn't get nominated for any Oscars next March, I give you my word that I'll lose the little faith I have left in the whole Academy Award system.

GRADE: 3 of 4 stars



Snakes on a Plane:
There are a few reasons I paid $7 to see Snakes on a Plane: To sit in a movie theatre with a bunch of friends, hear Samuel L. Jackson deliver what will surely be the most famous movie quote of the year, and laugh at the pure cheese on the screen. 

Did I expect this movie to be any good? Absolutely not. But I knew from the start that this wasn't going to be The Godfather.

The movie's called Snakes on a Plane, for God's sake. But the important question is whether I had a good time. Frankly, I haven't had that much fun this whole summer. 

Snakes on a Plane falls under an elite category of movies: the "So Bad, It's Good" category. Just anticipating the snakes being unleashed on the airplane populated with the "who's who" of stereotypical characters was a joy. 

We have the flight attendant on her last flight; the seemingly gay guy; the passenger afraid of flying; the flight attendant who could pass for a Playboy playmate; and the horny couple trying to join the Mile High Club. Add a Paris Hilton wannabe, a rapper and his posse, a rude Englishman plus Samuel L. Jackson in his "I'm the man" mode, and you have yourself a movie. 

The plot, apart from being about snakes on a plane, involves FBI agent Neville Flynn (Jackson) transporting the witness (Nathan Phillips) of a murder from Hawaii to Los Angeles. This being the movie it is, the bad guys get a hold of the location of the witness and unleash more than 500 snakes, including a 20-foot Python, on a commercial jetliner.

An hour into the flight, the reptiles are unleashed and the poor passengers get subjected to snake bites on every body part you can think of: You want breasts? You got it! Tongues? Done. Eye sockets? Check. Trust me, no body part is spared.

To say that Snakes on a Plane is a movie for the masses is an understatement.

Perhaps no other film in recent memory has had such a cult following before its release. The film's title spawned countless websites and parodies and was a punch line for almost anyone who enjoyed browsing any film related website.

The producers of the film actually upped the film's rating from PG-13 to R after fan interest peaked, adding a gratuitous sex scene, more gruesome snake deaths and explicit language, including Samuel L. Jackson's now infamous line.

GRADE: 3 of 4 stars

Headline: CEREMONIAL TORCH RE-LIT
Subheadline: Lighting tradition attracts more than 400 students
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
When senior Brian Tompkins came to FIU, he was startled by the lack of traditions.

"I wanted FIU to be richer in traditions," he said. "The Torch of Knowledge was never lit and, since it should always be lit, I thought of an idea to light it in a way the Olympics light their torch."

His idea came into fruition in 2004, when he and other members of the Student Alumni Association organized the first Trail of the Torch ceremony, an event created to promote FIU spirit among students.

The third annual Trail of the Torch ceremony took place at 7:30 p.m., in the Housing Quad Aug. 31. 

The two-hour event, sponsored by the Student Government Association of University Park and the Student Alumni Association, featured speeches by SGA and SAA representatives, and performances by a Hawaiian entertainment group and FIU's marching band. It was capped by the symbolic lighting of the Torch of Knowledge.

Sophomore Wolfgang Acevedo, attending his first Trail of the Torch ceremony, was thrilled.

"I think it's a great way to get students motivated with tradition at the University," Acevedo said. "The lighting of the torch is a way for our University to become more like other traditional universities."

Other students like junior Rosanna Martinez were unsure what the event was about.

"I have no idea what it is," Martinez said. "I'm just here because my friends were coming here and they don't really know what it's supposed to be either."

The symbolic torch's full title is the Torch of Knowledge, Service, and Understanding. It has occasionally been lit since its dedication in 1972 to the memory of the late Ernest Graham whose efforts in the Senate eventually led to the approval of the University.

Originally, though, the founders of the school had intended to keep the fires of the monument burning on a continual basis, a token of the man it honors and for the values it was intended to represent. 

However, in recent years, the torch has remained unlit mainly due to budgetary issues and disruptions caused by hurricanes. As a result, the torch is turned off a couple of weeks after the ceremony.

"We try to leave it on for the first couple of weeks of classes, but it's not possible because of the amount it costs to keep the flame burning," said Sean Kramer, director of Alumni Relations.

For this reason, some students like senior Bill Buchanan don't think the lighting of the torch is worth the hype and publicity.

"It doesn't make sense to have an event where we march around and give away free food and spend student money that could be spent on other things," Buchanan said. "The event has no bearing because they put the torch out within a span of the week. If they kept the torch on for the whole year, it would mean something to FIU and have some symbolism."

The event kicked off with an opening speech by SGA-UP President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon, who thanked an audience of more than 400 students for helping the event become an annual tradition at the University.

The trail events came to a conclusion with a half hour performance by Hawaiian entertainment company Aloha Islanders, who engaged students and organizers with Hula dances, fire knife dances and music.

Although some students such as sophomore John Reguera thought the Hawaiian entertainment was entertaining, he didn't see the connection with FIU spirit.

"I enjoyed parts of the Hawaiian performance, especially the fire knife performance, but I can't see how it helps build FIU spirit," Reguera said. "Maybe it's helping the student government get some closure, but it certainly isn't working for me." 

As the night came to an end, FIU's Marching Band took over the festivities of the evening by leading a candlelight procession from the Housing Quad to the Torch of Knowledge, located between Primera Casa and the Graham Center.

After the lighting of the torch, students were invited to Panther X-Plosion, an event where students were able to watch the FIU vs. Middle Tennessee football game while having dinner and enjoying themselves in foam pits.

Headline: New Panther Print service opens for business
Author: Jackie Diaz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Despite receiving a large number of customers during the opening week of school, the new Panther Print ran smoothly, according to Panther Print manager Aleida Romero.

"Although we have been busy, we were able to handle this type of a rush," said Romero. "We haven't received any complaints from students or staff."

Panther Print replaced the Copy Center this semester, after their contract with the University was ended during the Summer semester after servicing students for 10 years.

 "We're very excited of being in the midst of all the pump and energy of the university," said Felecia Townsend, Director of Business Services. 

Panther Print Document Management Services is the official name of the center because it will offer a variety of options when handling documents. 

As of now, Panther Print offers copies in black and white as well as color, transparencies, laser paper, business cards, letter head for FIU, scanning, binding, luggage tags and FedEx services. 

Black and white copies will cost 6 cents and 89 cents for colored copies.

In the future, the center plans to put in a computer for students to access jump drives to print files and burn disks. 

For years FIU has offered copying services to faculty and staff through the Duplicating Center - a branch of the University's copying services for faculty and staff. 

Townsend said that it was time to branch out and have something on campus for the students.  

The Copy Center was contracted out so that the FIU Duplicating Center could expand their services.

Townsend said that it was time to branch out and have something on campus for the students.	

"The timing was perfect," she said. "Their contract was expiring at the end of August." 

Five employees from the Duplicating Center were transferred to Panther Print to keep the staff the same. 

"The staff has been through extensive training," Townsend said. "They just finished one week of customer service training." 

Townsend said the staff has experience with the University chaos.  

The Duplicating Center began operation during the first days of school for FIU and copied everything from course packets to syllabi. 

Paulina Sanchez, who previously worked at the Duplicating Center said that not much had changed.

"Everything will be the same except now we'll be working with students and we got training," Sanchez said.

Romero agreed.

"Nothing has changed. We received customer service training from student services and everyone has experience with the duplicating center," Romero said. "The first week of classes has been very busy but we anticipated this since we have experience from the BBC Panther Print."

Romero said that in the span of the first week, they hadn't received a single complain.

For the moment, the center will be closed Saturdays and Sundays.  

According to Townsend, this will change depending on the needs of students and faculty. 

"The change is not a surprise to me. I don't understand why the school didn't have its own copy center in the first place," said Jorge Fernandez, junior and English major.

Local:
Miami remains busiest port 

According to a report released by International Council of Cruise Lines, Miami remained the world's busiest cruise-ship port in the world with almost 1.8 million people embarking on cruises last year.

Port Everglades was second on the list last year with nearly 1.3 million passengers, and Port Canaveral ranked third with 1.2 million passengers.

The Virginia-based cruise council released the port-by-port numbers as part of an annual report highlighting cruising's economic impact.

Last year was a strong one overall for the industry, as 11.5 million people worldwide took cruise vacations, up 6 percent from 2004.

Miami's passenger tally was up 5 percent, helping to reverse a decline of 14 percent in 2004.

Jeffs says he will not fight extradition

Warren Jeffs, the leader of the polygamist sect, made his first court appearance Thursday, since he was arrested Monday after more than a year on the run. 

The charismatic religious leader with an estimated 10,000 followers spoke almost inaudibly, saying he would not fight extradition to Utah on charges he arranged marriages between underage girls and older men. 

He is charged there with two counts of rape by accomplice and could get life in prison if convicted.

The 50-year-old leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints - a sect that broke away from the Mormon church more than a century ago and has been disavowed by the Mormons - was arrested after a traffic stop outside Las Vegas.

The manhunt had lasted more than a year and placed him on the FBI's Most Wanted List. Police said the 2007 Cadillac Escalade in which Jeffs rode was carrying three wigs, 15 cell phones, several laptop computers and $54,000.

U.S. seeks media monitoring in Iraq

The U.S. command in Baghdad is seeking bidders for a two-year, $20 million public relations contract that calls for monitoring the tone of Iraq news stories filed by U.S. and foreign media.

The solicitation, which was issued last week and will be due Wednesday, asks companies to show how they'll ''provide continuous monitoring and near-real time reporting of Iraqi, pan-Arabic, international, and U.S. media."

Headline: Police grill for students at BBQ
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Cop-a-Burger, a barbeque event meant to introduce students to the FIU Police Department, was a big success according to Candice Jones, a graduate student advisor for the Resident Hall Association.

"We're really excited to have an event like this. We saw the need to bridge the gap between students and campus police," said Jones. 	

The event, which took place on Sept. 1 under the gazebo in the University Park Apartments, started off with RHA President John Santella cooking up what many of the students showed up for: the burgers. 

"We came here for the food," said sophomore Jaime Martinez. 

 Several students who came, loaded up with food, and then left. 

Those who stayed for the entire event were able to experience; an informal get together with campus police. 

"I'm excited about the new year. I think it's going to be a big year for RHA," said Santella.   

Shortly after food was served, Bill King, the FIU Police Chief, gave a few words of welcome and thanks to the students who showed up for the event. 

It was exactly what he and his department had been wanting - a chance to talk one-on-one with students in a relaxing atmosphere.

At the end of King's words of welcome, he revealed that Cop-a-Burger was also a birthday celebration for two of his subordinates -- Janeene Hills, his communications manager, and Leidy Cabrera, his department's accountant.

The traditional happy birthday song was lead by a reluctant student and a cheerful officer. 

"We hardly get to do things like this. It's fun to get out with the students," said Cabrera who turned 35 on August 25. 

"It's nice to have a gathering with the students and the department. It's all to let them know we are here," said Hills who turned 37 on August 29.

According to King the crime rate at FIU is relatively small. 

Nonetheless, King assured that "all of our officers are well trained." 

In fact, all members of the FIU Police Department are certified through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

The FIU Police department is its own legitimate department and has all the arresting authority as any other police department according to King. 

In addition to Cop-a-Burger, the FIU Police Department is planning another event to follow Cop-a-Burger. The "Knock Knock" event is another way for the police department to promote themselves, their services and their department to students in case of an emergency.

King, who will be accompanied by two to three other officers, will go through the various housing buildings, knock on student's doors, and introduce themselves. 

"We have had excellent reactions with students. And we are always looking for ways to improve relations with students," King said.

The department's ultimate goal is out-reach and providing emergency information.

The department is located in the Tower Building at UP.

In case of an emergency, students should contact any of the department's two 24-hour hotlines at both FIU campuses: (305) 348-5911 for UP and (305) 919-5911 for Biscayne Bay.

Headline: COMMUTING TO FIU
Subheadline: University should help its students find alternatives to driving
Author: Zahra Contreras / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU enrolled 37,424 students for the Fall 2005 semester. With the opening of Lakeview Hall, FIU can house roughly 3,425 students. This leaves 34,000 students living off campus. The math proves the obvious: FIU is a commuter school.

To get to school, students must deal with the traffic through which they've become experts in weaving. After having arrived on campus, they must then deal with a parking situation that brings to mind images of a hawk stalking its prey. All of this on top of trying to get to class on time, which is sometimes impossible due to the aforementioned traffic. 

With extremely high gas prices, it's become even more of a pain for some students to simply get to school; as of Aug. 27 the national average for a gallon of regular gas was $2.80, whereas in Miami gas is roughly $3.00 per gallon. That can easily make getting to and from school four times a week a challenge to work into a college student's already thrifty budget.

Most of us recognize the need for education (if not, why would we be here?), and we need to actually get to FIU to get said education. But do the 34,000 of us that don't live on campus really have to drive? There are other options, but they may present a hassle that seems even bigger than paying too much for gas.

For example, Miami's fantastic public transportation system is hardly a great alternative to driving. With only a few routes going near FIU, it seems like a great idea to wake up at 5 a.m. to make all the appropriate connections and transfers necessary to get to class on time.  

Other perks include waiting in the terrible humidity for a bus that is running an hour late, sitting through the awesome thunderstorms you'll get to enjoy while waiting for your bus at a stop without shelter, and missing your stop because the driver didn't hear your request over the bus' lovely rumble.

Since Miami isn't going to reform its public transportation system any time soon, you've got to make the best of it if you choose to ride. Part of that would include taking advantage of the monthly MetroPass, which allows you to ride the MetroRail and MetroBuses as much as you desire for one flat fee. The pass is regularly $75, but there's also a discounted MetroPass for students that as of September, will be going for $37.50. You can buy them at the Parking & Traffic Office in the Gold Garage. 

However, if you want a pass on the 12th day of the month you may be out of luck, as FIU doesn't seem to get enough passes for everyone that needs one, and has been known to run out.

There are things FIU could do to assist us. We don't have the convenient location that UM does, but FIU might be able to allocate some of the money it has towards having a shuttle run from a Metro station that's not too far away (South Miami? Dadeland North?) to University Park during peak hours. It might be expensive, but hey-our tuition just jumped and our President just got a raise. I'm guessing there's money around. 

Getting enough MetroPasses to assure that everyone who needs one, gets one, would be less radical, however. Incentives for people who carpool to school might also be a good idea. This could be as easy as reserving a section of the garage specifically for carpooling cars. 

Would they consider taking that $10 parking fee on our tuition and giving us a gas card rather than making us renew our decals? 

Or how about extending some of the faculty parking to be accessible to student cars-there is almost always extra faculty parking, while we drive around and around looking for a spot. 

Finally, it would be great if people could stop being ticketed for creating their own parking spots (parking on the yellow lines/grass/etc). We don't do it because we want to, we do it because we have to!

Subheadline: Housing must change
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As they have done in the past, the Housing Office and Office of Residential Life evacuated students living at Bay Vista housing in the Biscayne Bay campus after Miami was placed under hurricane warning Aug. 29.

Because we're in the middle of hurricane season, these types of procedures are to be expected.

This year, though, housing administrators tried to do something different as Tropical Storm Ernesto came our way: take students from four different residence halls and moving them all into a single study lounge in Everglades Hall at the University Park campus.

In this instance, the storm proved to be nothing more than a glorified shower with a bit of wind. However, resident assistants and other housing staff are trained to react to all types of natural crisis, and they acted as they were trained to do.

During past storms, residents from Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties have been advised to return to their homes, while international and out-of-state students were kept in their respective halls.

On Tuesday, however, numerous inconsistencies and miscommunications from the administrators confused and at times upset residents already worried about the storm's progress.

Several residents complained that it was never made clear who should be evacuated where. Rumors spread during Ernesto that students who remained on campus would be made to stay in one of EH's lounges because of its safety.

However, EH was among the Housing Quad buildings that lost power after Hurricane Wilma last year, as well as being the only hall with shattered windows.

Why were students not told of the correct evacuation procedures beforehand? And why did the administrators choose to implement a mass evacuation in response to a tropical storm, when no such thing has been done for previous, more threatening hurricanes?

It seems like the hurricane preparations implemented in the residence halls last week were cooked up at the last minute. Neither residents nor RAs were clear on how to proceed.

As Matthew Gonsalves, a junior engineering major and resident of EH put it, "If it were a matter of safety, they would have given us 24-hour warnings. They wouldn't have called us at 9 p.m. and told us that those who were staying behind should gather food for three days. How did they expect students to gather three days worth of food in, what, three hours?" 

Indeed, this incident was not a matter of safety, but rather a matter of poor planning. 

Instructions were given at the last minute, resulting in confused action in the worst of cases, and inconvenience to residents at best.

As with all other standards and procedures they enforce, a standard protocol is needed for FIU housing during hurricane season. 

Otherwise, confusion and miscommunication during   an emergency situation could easily transform a safety measure into a safety hazard.

Subheadline: Miscues hurt Golden Panthers in season opener
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
MURFREESBORO, Tenn.-FIU's first full-fledged, bowl eligible, Division I-A season began with a sputter Aug. 31 as the visitors dropped their season opener 7-6 to a less than deserving Middle Tennessee (1-0, 1-0 Sun Belt).

The Golden Panther defense led the way in shutting down their opposition, allowing just 175 total yards. Senior defensive Antwan Barnes led the way with four sacks. 

Senior linebacker and Preseason Sun Belt Conference Defensive Player of the Year Keyonvis Bouie added 13 tackles, yet three costly mistakes throughout the course of the game cost the team dearly. 

FIU (0-1, 0-1) got off to a fantastic start after receiving the opening kickoff, rolling down the field and chewing up valuable clock time. 

The drive, which culminated with a 12-yard Julian Reams touchdown, saw quarterback Josh Padrick's side convert two fourth downs while in "no man's land." 

Senior kicker Chris Patullo, taking over the duties for the first time in his career, missed the extra point, which would end up being the difference.  The drive covered 80 yards on 17 plays and took nearly the first eight minutes off the clock. 

"We started off strong with the 17-play drive," admitted head coach Don Strock. "We tried to establish the run after the first series but couldn't get anything going."

Padrick completed 21-of-38 passes for 132 yards on the night, finding tight end Samuel Smith for a career high 11 receptions and 63 yards. 

Reams led the Golden Panthers' rushing game with 81 yards on 13 carries. 

"I just don't think we connected as a team tonight," said Smith. "I think we will be back and have a good season, we just have to stop making mental errors."

FIU looked to take a 6-0 shutout into the locker room at halftime but a costly mental error on MTSU's final drive of the half cost the Golden Panthers that fate. 

After MTSU managed a first down that brought the ball to the Blue Raiders' 33-yard line, FIU's defensive lineman Jon Betancourt sacked quarterback Clint Marks for a 6-yard loss. The sophomore was then whistled for unsportsmanlike conduct handing MTSU a first down at their own 43-yard line. 

From there, senior tailback Eugene Gross took over, carrying the ball three times for 46 yards, and culminated the drive with a 33-yard touchdown run down the left sideline.  

Gross finished the night with 82 yards on 18 carries. DeMarco McNair, out with an injury last season, added 51 yards on eight carries. 

"We had a lot of opportunities to win the game," Strock said. "We just let them pass by. We had more chances then I could count to make big plays and score points, we just couldn't execute."

The second half was a defensive showdown as neither offense was able to get anything going. 

Following an interception by junior Lionell Singleton, Patullo's struggles continued as he missed a 41-yard field goal that would have put Strock's men two points clear. 

FIU's final and most costly mistake of the night came with 6:31 to play in the fourth quarter. 

Trailing by one, the defense stood its ground following a fantastic punt by freshman Chris Cook that pinned the hosts on their own 2-yard line.

Following a three-and-out that saw the Blue Raiders manage to move the football to their own 5-yard line, punter Colby Smith booted a punt out of his own endzone to waiting freshman receiver and kick returner John Houston Whiddon. 

The first year man miscalculated the trajectory of the ball, bouncing right next to him and taking a favorable 39-yard MTSU roll down to the FIU 16-yard line. 

From there FIU was left to sulk another missed opportunity in the Sun Belt Conference as Padrick was unable to produce a valuable drive.   

The Golden Panther offensive line, which had had a microscope placed on it before the game even though two scheduled starters were scratched before the trip, allowed five sacks in their first performance, still leaving many questions to be answered. 

FIU left Miami a day early because of the threat of Hurricane Ernesto. 

"I am truly proud of how resilient the team has been this week," Strock said. "Leaving on Tuesday and practicing at Vanderbilt, then coming here to play all under the threat of a hurricane. Through all this, they did a great job." 

FIU travels to Tampa for a Sept. 9 showdown at the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Raymond James Stadium, with the University of South Florida.

Headline: Despite better stats, mistakes cost FIU a win
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Looking at team statistics following the FIU's 7-6 loss to Middle Tennessee, it would have made sense for FIU to be 1-0 at the beginning of the season, not the opposite. 

The Golden Panthers had more first downs than the Blue Raiders. They also had more rushing yards and total yards,   had less penalties and sacked senior quarterback Clint Marks six times.

Still, the scoreboard read 7-6, in the Blue Raiders' favor.

So what was the difference?

It couldn't have been an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and a missed point-after-touchdown - could it?

Unfortunately for the Golden Panthers, that proved to be the backbreaker.

Their first drive couldn't have gone any more perfect; it took them 17 plays to drive 80 yards in seven minutes and 48 seconds and score first on a 12-yard touchdown run by sophomore Julian Reams. Everything was perfect until  that botched PAT. The Golden Panthers would have had 7-0 if it weren't for a missed extra point by senior place kicker Chris Patullo.

Unlike the special teams, the defense proved stout throughout the entire game. The only mistake of the unit came when sophomore defensive tack Jonathan Betancourt was flagged for an excessive celebration penalty, following a sack. Three plays later, the Blue Raiders scored on a 33-yard rushing touchdown.

Before the score, the Blue Raiders didn't have a drive that lasted more than five plays and only amassed 60 yards of total offense.

But unlike the Blue Raiders, the Golden Panthers couldn't capitalize on mistakes.

Surprisingly, the play of the game would come from MTSU's punter. After the defense pinned the Blue Raiders to punt from their 5-yard line, punter Colby Smith lofted a 79-yard punt over the head of freshman punt returner John Houston Whiddon that started the Golden Panther offense on their own 16-yard line.

On the same drive, coach Don Strock made a questionable call on fourth down. With 4:20 left in the game on fourth and one with the offensive, Strock elected to punt instead of going for it, even though they were 3-of-3 on fourth down conversions. 

Getting away from the negativity, the Golden Panthers showed a lot of reasons why this year will be a solid year for them, despite the fact that many media members picked them to finish last in the Sun Belt Conference.

Entering the season, the Golden Panthers offensive line was considered to be one of the weaknesses of the team this year. Not helping the cause, junior guard Mike Alvarez didn't play due to a knee injury, while junior right guard Jeffery Eugene couldn't start because his paper work for NCAA certification wasn't completed in time by the University. 

Despite all the hardships, the young offensive line performed well. They gave senior quarterback Josh Padrick enough time to rack up 132 yards passing, while creating room for the Panthers to average 3.9 yards per carry.

The same couldn't be said for the Blue Raiders offensive line. They had trouble all night picking up the Golden Panthers' blitz and couldn't come up with solutions for senior defensive end Antwan Barnes who recorded four of the six sacks; he only needs eight more sacks to eclipse his total from last season.

Besides the game being broadcast on ESPN Plus, senior tight end Samuel Smith made ESPN SportsCenter's Top Ten Plays of the Night for his leaping, one-handed catch in the first quarter. 

Smith and the rest of the team hope they will make ESPN's Top Ten list throughout the year, instead of the network's Not-So-Top-Ten for silly plays like a missed PAT.

Traffic by campus entrance not as congested as expected

Traffic on NE 151 Street at the entrance of the Biscayne Bay campus has been tolerable and stress-free, despite anticipation from faculty, Public Safety officers and students.

Public Safety Captain Michael Wright and Assistant Dean Saul R. Sztam had sent out a mass e-mail to all BBC students warning them of a possible traffic back-up on the road before the semester started.

The recent opening of the David Lawrence Jr. K-8 Center and the on-going construction of the Biscayne Landing condos by the campus entrance were the primary sources of concern.

Traffic was expected to be a problem during the drop-off and pick-up hours at the school, which is 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. to 3 p.m., according to the mass e-mail.

The North Miami Police Department is working with FIU Pubic Safety and the new school to insure everyone's safety. Several police officers will be in the area of NE 151 Street to monitor the situation and watch for speeders. 

Administrators still looking to fill BBC vice-provost position

The search continues for a new vice-provost for FIU's Biscayne Bay campus.

Raul Moncarz, BBC's former provost, retired last spring after nine years at the university.

He was regarded as the face of BBC and helped bring various new programs to the campus, such as the marine science building expected to open this month.

Campus administration have been meeting to discuss the future of BBC as well as the part that the vice-provost will play, according to Douglas Wartzok, executive vice-provost for University Park. 

They also had planned to meet this past Monday with various vice-presidents to discuss the position more in-depth.  They hope to hire an interim vice-provost in a few weeks.

Headline: Exotic trees removed for campus expansion
Author: Agustina Prigoshin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As new buildings are going up, Biscayne Bay Campus's Australian pine trees are coming down.

 "It's terrible," said Carmen Tucker, the senior secretary for the School of Journalism and Mass Communications. "All the trees have been knocked down and our wonderful view of Oleta River State Park from our windows has been blocked by the new marine biology building that's been built in their place." 

Two years ago, Airmark Grounds began clearing the trees behind Academic One and Two to set the foundation for the new marine biology building.

Last October, Hurricane Wilma gave Airmark Grounds a hand by knocking down even more trees.

According to Honoriu Filimon, coordinator of construction projects, a lot of the streets and buildings around campus were damaged by the trees that Wilma knocked down.

"In order to repair the parking lots we needed to uproot and remove the trees, but we will be replacing them," he said. 

Removing the trees costs $181,000 and replacing them with sod, especially outside the Physical Plant building, costs $36,000, according to Brian Bitar, assistant director at the Physical Plant.

 Junior Gigi Diaz expressed her concern about the campus's changing look. 

"There's something soothing about simple things like seeing flowers and standing under a tree for shade. I don't think taking these little things away to be replaced by buildings and parking lots, which are stressful, is such a good idea,"

Filimon said that new trees would be replanted soon-with the exception of Australian Pines. These Australian-native trees, which happen to be the main type of tree on campus, prove to be more dangerous than expected.

Michael S. Ross, an ecology research scientist, explained that Australian pine is an exotic breed- an invasive species. 

Florida can't provide them with the sufficient soil depth they require; and with no firm ground to grasp onto they topple over when hurricanes hit, damaging whatever they land on.

They also prohibit other plants from growing underneath or around them.

Due to their hazardous nature in Florida, private property owners and city officials prefer to have them cut down to prevent future destruction.

Whatever the reasons for cutting down the trees, both faculty and students miss their presence.

"I miss parking my car in the shade those trees use to provide," Tucker said.

Senior Alain Castillo understands the necessity to cut down trees in order to build new foundations. 

"But I feel that trying to reproduce what was once a natural landscape with new trees will never be the same," he said.
