Headline: UNLV comes back to defeat men's basketball, 83-77
Author: Marisabel Mu√±oz / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
At half-time, Donnie Marsh told his team to expect the pressure, the pressure from an embarrassed host team who was losing in front of 9,764 Las Vegas fans to what the local press had deemed a "little-known" FIU team.

Despite the FIU men's basketball team's (10-17, 4-8 SBC) seven point lead at half-time and the coach's warning, the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, fourth in the Mountain West conference with a 16-13 overall record, did just as expected. Defending their four-win home streak, the Rebels defeated the Golden Panthers 83-77, Wednesday night.

"We controlled the tempo, dictated the game in the first half. They were playing without their starting point guard, so the plan was to confuse whoever played that position, and we did," Marsh said.

The highlight was an 11-0 run led by Carlos Morban. With 10 minutes to go in the first, Morban hit two free throws. He got a dunk, a lay up and a three-pointer, together with an assist to Taurance Johnson.

Then came the second half.

"From being the aggressor, we became intimidated. Good teams sense that. We need to fight that off. Be stronger," Marsh said.

Another 11-0 run, now beloning to the Rebels, was really courtesy of the Golden Panthers. Up 49-42 with 15 minutes left in the game, FIU's Rodrigo Viegas walked. The Rebels' Dalron Johnson steals a ball. FIU then is unable to inbound a ball, and UNLV's Jevon Banks steals it. A fifth consecutive FIU turnover on a backcourt violation tied the game at 49. 

Working off free throws between Banks and Johnson, the Rebels pull a three point lead. FIU kept the game within single digits with free throws by Morban and Carlos Fernandez in the last stretch of the game. But UNLV's Johnson scored his only trey of the night to reach 22 points, taking his team's lead to seven. 

Morban led the Golden Panthers with 22 points, scoring 11 of 14 free throws. UNLV's starting point guard, Marcus Banks, did not play because of an injury to his left ankle a few days earlier versus Utah.

The Golden Panthers continue their search for not only a player who will make a big play at the right time, but in believing in their coach and the game plan to take the win. 

"I believe they can do it. I truly believe it," Marsh said. "But all you can do is give messages. I don't know if they believe it."

As far as the Golden Panthers' lapse at UNLV, Marsh said it will take recognizing the opponent's pressure and dealing with it, not turning backs and showing weakness.

"[FIU] did not sense when [the game] was in the balance, they backed up," Marsh said. "It's a sequence you go through. You have to be there, you have to get to that notch, crank it up."

"And to do that, you need someone to step up."

"Rodrigo [Viegas] wants to be that guy, [but] he has been in that situation. It hasn't come through, so he is in a questioning mode. We have seen some signs [in other players wanting to step up], in Carlos Morban and Taurance [Johnson]."

With a week off between UNLV and their next game, FIU will wrap up their season at Arkansas State (13-15) on Thursday and at Arkansas Little-Rock (16-9) on Saturday.

Headline: Women's basketball knocks out Hurricanes
Subheadline: Moody, Slavtcheva lead FIU over cross-town rival in physical game
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
FIU and the University of Miami renewed its cross-town rivalry for the 47th time on Saturday night in a contest that often resembled a boxing match rather than a basketball game.

The Golden Panthers (21-5, 11-1 Sun Belt) defeated the Hurricanes (15-9, 8-5 Big East) 71-65 in front of 1,163 at the Knight Sports Complex, where Miami had a 10-2 record. Much of the crowd that saw FIU win its eighth straight and 14th in the last 16 games were Golden Panthers supporters and drowned out the Hurricanes fans for much of the second half.

For FIU, the game was more than a non-conference match-up.

"[The Hurricanes] are so cocky," forward Cheryl Moody said. "We really wanted to come out and show them that we rule down south."

The physical and defensively dominated game featured long scoreless periods and low shooting percentages. FIU shot 37 percent from the field, while Miami converted on 38. The two teams combined for 30 turnovers.

"I thought [the officials] let the second half go a little physical," head coach Cindy Russo said. "I guess they call it a little tighter in the Sun Belt than they do in the Big East."

FIU's Cheryl Moody and Miami's Chanivia Broussard and Martha Bodley all faced foul trouble in the second half. 

Moody picked up her fourth foul early in the second and played most of the final 10 minutes without committing another. FIU played a 2-3 zone defense, which helped the forward stay away from a fifth foul.

"I was playing patient," Moody said. "We were in a zone, so that helped a lot because I didn't have to defend man-to-man."

Moody recorded her 17th double-double of the year with 15 points and 15 rebounds in 32 minutes.

"I think she played very smart. I think she had another brilliant performance," Russo said.

Both Broussard and Bodley fouled out of the game. Those foul outs proved to be critical as Miami was forced to play the final 3:53 without their combined 31 points.

The teams entered halftime with the Golden Panthers leading 32-28, but Miami stormed out of the locker room with a 17-6 run to take a 45-38 lead with 14:06 remaining in the game.

FIU responded with a 17-6 run of its own which culminated with a Gergana Slavtcheva three-point play. Slavtcheva grabbed an offensive rebound, circled back outside and then drove inside for a lay-up. The free throw gave the Golden Panthers a 55-51 lead at the 8:40 mark.

Slavtcheva led all scorers with 18 points. She added 12 rebounds.

Miami would tie the game with a Shaquana Wilkins' jump shot before the Golden Panthers took the last lead 57-55 on a Moody shot.

FIU used a free throw filled final 6:56 to hold off the Hurricanes and secure the win.

"I think we were just a little more of a veteran team tonight and that made a difference," Russo said.

The Golden Panthers won the battle on the boards for the 25th time this season, out-rebounding Miami 48-35. FIU is 21-4 in those 25 games.

Mandy Shafer scored 15 points with nine coming from behind the three-point arc. She also contributed four steals, two blocks, four rebounds and two assists. Cormisha Cotton added 11 points and nine rebounds.

Up Next

FIU will finish its regular season this week. The final home game of the year is Thursday against Arkansas State, where FIU will attempt to avenge its only conference loss, and the Golden Panthers will then travel to Arkansas-Little Rock on Saturday.

FIU will enter the Sun Belt Conference Tournament, Feb. 28-March 5, as the No. 1 seed in the East Division. 

The Golden Panthers came into Saturday's game with 41 votes in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches poll, which unofficially places them 27th in the nation. 

Russo said that she is hopeful that her team will crack the top-25 rankings today when the new polls are announced.

 FIU won 7-2 in its last game versus UC Santa Barbara at the Campbell/Cartier Tournament hosted by San Diego State, but lost a close one in the opening round. 

"It was a little dissappointing [losing to Cal State]. [Had FIU won,] we would have gone over 500 on the weekend and it would have been a great win over a great, top 10 team," head coach Kim Gwydir said. "[Yet] some players hit homeruns that had never done that before. Obviously I'm happy with the wins."

Versus Santa Barbara, Gillen led FIU with three RBI hits. Amanda Nealer earned the win for FIU.

San Diego 6, FIU 2

Scoring for the Aztecs began early with Janna Kovesnky reaching third on an error by Nicosia followed by a single by Tiffany Goudy that led Kovensky home. 

With no outs and bases loaded, FIU's Nicole Dubovik lined to Figueroa at short. 

Figueroa then tagged second and threw to third for a triple play. 

FIU 5, Sacramento State 1

FIU posted a single run in the first inning and three more in the second for the win.

Headline: Edwards out for year
Subheadline: Lugo no longer on baseball roster
Author: Alex Baswell/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Andrew Edwards, FIU's number one pitcher in the starting rotation, is out for the rest of the year and will have Tommy John surgery. He tore his ulnacollateral ligament in his right throwing arm during the first game of the season against Central Florida.

In the 5-4 loss to UCF on Feb. 1, Edwards threw for four innings, allowing only one hit, one run, four walks and six strikeouts.

Edwards might have surgery sometime during spring break.

"It's a really tough loss," head coach Danny Price said. "It's very dissapointing when your number one pitcher goes down on his first night. But those things happen and you just have to move on."

Edwards is a junior college transfer from Briarcliffe College in Long Island, NY. In his sophomore season, he went 9-3 with a 3.50 ERA.

Lugo is MIA

Ozzie Lugo, a right-handed closer has been 'MIA' the past several weeks and is now not currently on the roster. 

Price is disapointed and does not know of Lugo's whereabouts. 

"I don't know what to tell you. It's a huge disapointment," Price said. "I don't know what's going on. I haven't heard from him."

Asked on whether Lugo would be able to rejoin the team if he were to emerge from his whereabouts, Price said, "He has some stuff to get done. If he showed up I would talk to him, but I don't expect him to show up."

Lugo broke the Sun Belt Conference record last year when he was credited with 17 saves.

Subheadline: FIU outscores opponent 47-13 in three game series
Author: Alex BraswellStaff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU baseball team took their seventh consecutive win this season, defeating St. Francis 17-5 on Sunday. FIU went 3-0 over the weekend, and is now 7-1 on the season.

FIU starter, feshman Derek DeCarlo, made his first start a winner by pitching five innings, allowing one earned run. Tommy Duenas went 4-5, including a homerun, three runs scored and a double. Alex Suarez finished 3-4 with three RBI and two doubles. The Golden Panthers had six doubles.

Game 2: FIU 21, St. Francis 2

FIU (6-1) put on an offensive power display as they defeated St. Francis (0-2) 21-2 Saturday. FIU scored in every inning except the sixth and seventh. 

"We talked about this last night," FIU head coach Danny Price said. "We thought we were a better baseball team than we've been playing. I've been expecting [the offensive play] for a while. It was something that was due."

FIU was up 12-1 in the bottom of the eighth inning when they put up the best scoring inning of the game and season. The Golden Panthers scored nine runs.

Hector Nu√±ez, Michael New and Dean Adams led off with three consecutive singles.

Luis Garcia's walk brought in Nu√±ez. Up 17-1 with the bases load, New stepped up to the plate and hit a grand slam, FIU's first of the season. 

"It felt pretty good," New said of his grand slam.

Fourteen batters batted in the inning.

Brad Eldred hit the longest home run of the season in the the third inning. Up 4-0, Eldred hit his third home run of the year, a solo shot over the center field wall, that distanced more than 400 feet.

"I was just looking for a good pitch," Eldred said. "I was looking for a fastball away and I got under it a little bit."

Game 1: FIU 9, St. Francis 6

FIU came back from a 5-2 deficit in the fifth inning to beat St. Francis 9-6 in front of 273 fans at University Park Stadium on Friday.

FIU scored two runs in the bottom of the first inning off a single to center field by Bernie Gonzalez, which brought in Summerall and Nu√±ez. 

"It was a nice breaking ball and I just drove it right back to the middle," Gonzalez said.

St. Francis took the lead in the fifth inning by scoring five runs, one on a short bunt by Mike Molinini. FIU pitcher Joshua Banks attempted to throw to  home plate but bobbled it. Rob Caccchioli scored from third base. 

"I don't remember the last time I had an error," Banks said.

Banks' error cost the team as the throw to home plate would have been the last out. Instead, the Terriers' next batter, Anthony Esposito, nailed a grand slam, and St. Francis took a 5-2 lead.

"The error came back and haunted me," Banks said. "I threw a fastball away, and I should have thrown a fastball inside."

FIU tied the score 5-5 in the bottom half of the inning. Skip Adams, who reached first on an infield single, scored when Adam Summerall  tripled to the center field wall. Later on, Eldred's double scored in Summerall. Gonzalez's single to left field brought in Eldred for the tie.

FIU took control of the game in the bottom of the sixth with two runs scored. Solomon Frieder led off with a deep, high home run to right field, his first of the year. Summerall, who got on base on a walk, then stole second base and was already on the run when Alex Ansoleaga hit a single.

Down 8-5, St. Francis could only rally for one more run in the top of the eighth inning to cut the lead 8-6. FIU added an insurance run in the bottom of the eighth inning on a bases loaded situation. All three base runners reached base on walks. Alejandro Suarez was walked, and Ansoleaga scored the last run to make the final score 9-6.

In six innings of play, Banks did not give up a run.  Banks has now not allowed a run in 11 straight innings.

"I wish we could come out here and not keep coming from behind," Price said. "We [have got to] play nine innings of baseball and we're not doing it right now."

Headline: College of Law prepares for fall opening
Author: Adriana Oliva/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The College of Law will officially open its doors to law students in the fall of 2002, almost two years after Gov. Jeb Bush signed the bill establishing the college.

Classes range from Legal Skills and Values I to constitutional law. The law program will focus primarily on international and comparative law.

The administration has also been working on some of the other details for the college. Faculty and staff are currently being hired and a small number of students have already been admitted. Faculty and staff are also currently working on future plans such as community service projects.

The curriculum for the first year is set. There will be 31 hours of required courses. 

Along with such classes as Torts and Contracts, students will be required to take Introduction to International and Comparative Law. 

"FIU is one of the only law schools that requires the Introduction to International and Comparative Law course in the first year," College of Law Dean Leonard Strickman said.

Aside from the curriculum, College of Law students will have to participate in other tasks. These include clinical programs, which are being planned around the community so students can get some hands-on experience. Service projects for upper division students are also being designed. 

Of 19 admission offers sent to students, five students have already enrolled and made a deposit on  tuition fees. Strickman is optimistic that there will be a good number of students in the fall.

"There is a mission to reach out to strong students," Associate Dean for Admissions and Student Services Michelle Mason said. "The law program will probably be staying small for about three or four years, basically until they move into their own facilities. "

As far as the faculty and staff are concerned, eight professors have been hired.

"Two out of the eight have a good deal of law school teaching," Strickman said.

Four of those professors have won best teacher awards. The college still has to hire two more. 

The college will use the Green Library as its base of operations. Classes will be held mainly on the first, third and fourth floors. 

There have been three recruitment open houses and there will be two more to come. 

"Our doors are open for any students who might be interested." Mason said. 

Currently, the College of Law is not accredited. But Mason is hopeful that the two-year accreditation process will take place by the summer of 2004. If the college is accredited, students will be able to take their bar exams in 2005. 

The admissions deadline is June 1. Some basic requirements include a bachelor's degree, as well as taking the LSAT and an overall good performance in college. Graduates will be taught to practice in any area of law. 

Expectations at the College of Law are very good. "I'm very optimistic about getting off to a good start," Strickman said.

Headline: Students to help with trade center clean up
Author: Asra JawaidContributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students on this year's Alternative Spring Break trip will get nationally televised recognition for their good deeds.

A few months ago, the CBS newsmagazine "48 Hours" e-mailed the various universities participating in this effort. Because student Alex Zarut responded to the mail, reporters from the show will interview all of the FIU students participating.

This interview will appear in an episode dedicated entirely to the various ways students spend their spring break. 

Zarut, a junior, will spend spring break in New York City, helping clean up the debris that was left behind after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Fourteen other FIU students will join him on this nine-day adventure.

Zarut, the site leader, will be participating in this event on behalf of the Alternative Spring Break program run by FIU's Volunteer Action Center.

"I [wanted] to go to New York City for this program since the bombings happened," said Zarut. "Before that, I wanted to do something, but I wasn't sure how I could make myself useful."

Zarut also wants to help because of the magnitude of the bombings.

"This is the biggest tragedy," he said. "Knowing that I can go and help would be an amazing experience." 

The 15 FIU students will depart from Miami on March 16 and return on March 24. VAC Assistant Director Patricia Temino will accompany them.

"I'm going, of course, to help with the cleanup. I also have family living in the suburbs, so it's a balance of both," Temino said. 

"As soon as I heard there was a site going to New York, I knew I had to go," said Christy Carbot, a junior who will participate for the first time this year. "I feel it's my duty, like every American, to do something to help the victims.  I believe this is my chance; it only happens once in a lifetime."

After Zarut decided this is the project he wants to do and applied for an opportunity to go on the trip, it was approved.

Five of the other student spots have been filled. 

Members of Alternative Spring Break were in the Graham Center promoting the trip. Applications for interested students are available, as is the opportunity to set up an interview, another requirement of potential participants in the Volunteer Action Center, located in GC 345.

Once in New York, the selected students have many activities planned. After a training session on the first day of their arrival, they will spend eight hours each day feeding other workers who are helping out and assisting in the rest area. They will be working with the Salvation Army.

In their spare time, the group does plan to explore the city.

"I'm not sure exactly where we will go, but after we finish our work for the day, we'll probably do a little shopping and see some of the sights New York City has to offer," Zarut said.

Freshmen and sophomores are always welcome to apply since they can participate in the program this year and, after coming back next year, recruit new participants. 

Maturity plays an important role in deciding who will participate.

"Maturity is important because Ground Zero is a serious issue. We need people who can represent FIU in a dignified manner," Zarut said. 

Although fundraising, community sponsorships and student government have donated money to significantly reduce their cost, participants are still required to pay $95 in order to participate. This money covers everything from airfare to and from New York as well as hotel charges, food, and nightlife.

Headline: Classes slowed by tardy textbooks
Author: Katia FuminayaStaff Writer
&nbsp;
What happens when your syllabus reads: "Quiz on assigned reading," but the reading is in a book that is out of stock or on backorder?

A quiz was scheduled in a journalism class but students questioned how they were expected to be tested on study material they did not have. The quiz was based on readings from a book that was out of stock at the campus bookstore at the Biscayne Bay Campus. The bookstore had stocked their shelves with 10-15 books in the beginning of the spring 2002 semester but the enrollment number for the class is 20. Those books quickly ran out, leaving a few students without a book. The professor acknowledged that giving a quiz would not have been fair ‚Äì the quiz was postponed.

Professor Charles Green, who teaches the journalism course, said the School of Journalism staff collects bookorder forms a month in advance.
"Carmen [senior secretary of the School of Journalism] is usually pretty good at ordering the books‚Ä¶The books were supposed to be here for the first day of class," Green said.

However, Immer Rivera, Bookseller at Graham Center's Bookstore said that is not always the case.

"Many professors don't get the forms in on time," Rivera said.

Publishers postpone 'due' dates

Supervisor of the Graham Center Bookstore Gabi Pappaterra said publishers give them due dates. Due dates are the scheduled day of book availability. Pappaterra said books are on backorder mainly or only because publishers do not have the books ready by due date. 
"Due dates are never true; they get postponed a lot," Pappaterra said.
BBC Bookstore Manager Erica Garvey said books arrive late because of a combination of situations.

"Many times we get book orders late from professors," she said. "Publishers also have new editions of a book and they might not be ready on time."

Enrollment numbers also affect whether there are enough books for a class.

"We check enrollment the Friday before classes start," Garvey said. "We may have the books in and then we find out the enrollment has changed. The publishers use ground shipping and that takes five to seven days." 

Professors claim books are under ordered

Books on backorder have interrupted class pace in several departments.
Professor Alfred Lopez teaches ENG 3012, a class requiring four books. Some of which were on backorder several weeks into class.  Lopez believes the books for his classes were under ordered.

"The bookstore bases their book orders on the enrollment numbers of the previous year," Lopez said. 

Lopez refrained from altering his course syllabus. Instead he lent his book and encouraged copymaking. 

Associate Professor of Journalism William Adams has also had several problems with getting books for his class on time.

"For the last two and a half years, I can almost count the headaches‚Ä¶books get here late," Adams said.

Now, he and several other professors encourage students to purchase books online. 

Papaterra said the bookstore uses various methods to monitor enrollment numbers.

"The number of books we order are based on previous enrollment numbers and book order forms," Papaterra said.

Garvey said it is an added expense for the bookstore to have to return books to publishers.

Arts and Sciences Associate Dean Gisela Casines said she would like to avoid any future problems. "I talked to bookstore staff about the delay and how it couldn't go on. I told them that it was important to get the right number of books on time," Casines said.

A meeting has been scheduled post midterms in order to find a better method to calculate the number of books necessary for a course.

"The need to work closer with faculty to obtain accurate enrollment numbers will be discussed," Casines said.

Headline: Too many films ruins festival
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
When I think of the FIU Miami Film Festival, I always get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside. The festival has always been an opportunity for me to participate in a great cultural event that prizes artistic vision and departs from the mainstream, which is often a rare and welcomed sight. 

Last year, I participated actively in the festival for the first time, donating my time simply, as the festival's motto states, "for the love of the film." I volunteered to usher the festival and my only payment was being allowed to watch the films for free. In the end, it was a great experience. Of course, that was last year.

Last year the festival was much smaller and received much less publicity. 
Having participated in the festival when it was smaller and less publizied, I have come to appreciate the intimacy it once had.  Last year, it had fewer films, showcased only in one theatre, and didn't receive as much fanfare.

When it was over, few people I encountered had even heard about it, and me and my friend and fellow usher kept the experience in a special place in our hearts, like the unspoken bond between identical twins.
 
So, like many others, I was concerned when things started to change for the festival. When its leadership was placed into the hands of a new director, David Poland, I anticipated some changes, but not the disaster it became. I had hoped the festival would change for the better, that it would gain more recognition. 

Unfortunately, all it did was lose its commitment to its films in a shameless quest for media acclaim.  It received more publicity than ever in a year when it deserved about the same attention given to any movie starring Mariah Carey. In a way, the festival was even worse than "Glitter," when you consider that it had much more artistic integrity to lose.

Of course, it's not like every movie premiering at the festival this year was bad.  There were a few good ones to speak of; "Y Tu Mama Tabien" or "Raw Deal," for example.  The fact is that Poland still overspent the $1 million budget. While we may not know the specifics, it is clear the festival spread itself out too thinly.

It seems like, in order to bring up the number of movies shown and still stay within the budget, quality was somewhat sacrficed and for every good movie there were many films not worthy of the festival or the admission price, which is more than twice the cost of a regular movie.
 
Here are a few tips for next year's director:

Remember the age-old adage "Less is more"? If you can't afford 50 films and multiple screenings, show fewer, better films. 

Remember the amount of money people are paying to see these films, when they could go to a theatre and pay half the price. Show good films they probably wouldn't have a chance to watch in most mainstream theatres, like "Raw Deal" and last year's "Amores Perros." 

Whatever you do, avoid irrrelevant documentaries like "Revolution OS," even if you personally get off on the thrill and high drama of computer languages.  Most of us can do without them.  

Basically, what it all comes down to are the films; it is after all a film festival.  Show fewer films if you must, but make the majority of them good, or at least decent. 

This year, one of the worst aspects of the festival were the "filler" films, like all the screenings of old movies and the bad documentaries. I was half expecting to see "Little Timmy's 2nd Birthday Party" sandwiched between "Raw Deal" and "Audition."

Although we don't know for sure how the budget was overspent, it seems like the festival simply wanted to grow too fast and lost sight of its priorities. 

In hindsight, I guess it's fitting the festival premi√®red with "One from the Heart," a film which almost buried Francis Ford Coppola in debt.  

Hopefully, like Coppola, the festival will find its way back.

Headline: In Our View: Book orders need to arrive on time
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The first responsibility of any university is to serve its students in the best way possible. Though not totally their fault, students are suffering because bookstores are arriving late at the bookstore. Late or underordered books are leading to missed assignments and dropped classes.

The blame can be divided between the university bookstores and their distributors, who apparently fail to fully comprehend what "due date" means. 

Though not always financially feasible, it's disheartening to see that book orders rarely match the number of students enrolled in classes. Perhaps it's because students tend to drop classes early on in the semester. We'd bet a number of those students are dropping classes because they don't have the books and would prefer trying their hand at something else.

The fault also lies with professors and staff that wait until the last minute or later to turn in information on their classes so the books can be ordered on time. If this information is turned in late to distributors that habitually send books to the university late, professors should be prepared to change their class plans to accomodate missing and tardy textbooks.

Obviously, no one can help it if a new edition of a book is late because it's still being printed or finished, but by eliminating the problem of late orders, many more books would be available to students. It would make bad business sense to suggest the book store over-stock on books just in case more students register. But by keeping the number of books ordered the same as the class roster at the time of the order, you assure that a significant number of the students will have a chance to get their books on time. Lowballing orders to save a few bucks is unacceptable when we're talking about a student's education.

Ordering also should not be done based on last year's registration numbers. There are too many variables. Different professors, different trends and different class offerings combine to create totally unique class environments each semester. Who's to say how many people will take a certain section of ENC 1101? The safest bet is to check the current class listing and order accordingly.

At the same time, students are not totally free from responsibility. If you're paying money not only for your education, but for your books, it's silly to gripe about late books as the sole reason for class problems. Aside from the university bookstore, there are a number of feasible outlets where students can get their books. Websites and local booksellers geared toward students are easy to find and sometimes offer the same books for lower prices. It's just a matter of taking the time and looking.

Headline: 'Club FIU' atmosphere inappropriate for university
Author: Virginia C. Cornett
&nbsp;
I'll start this out by telling you that I'm somewhat of a "non-traditional" student, which means that I didn't start my graduate degree straight out of undergrad: I waited about 15 years.  So that means that, of course, I'm a bit older than most of the students here at FIU.  It's a blessing and a curse at the same time.  I have the life experience and wisdom to apply myself to my studies and to prioritize my tasks to accomplish the most in the least amount of time, which is a blessing.  

The curse is that being older places me closer to the age category of most of my fellow students' parents and somewhat sets me apart from my peers. I'm stuck right in between the Baby Boom generation and Generation X.   So, I look at my fellow students half as a colleague and half as a parent.  Most of the time, I feel like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, so when I walk through Graham Center during lunchtime, one half of me is excited to see students hanging out and hip-hop music blaring - students having fun.  The other half, however, is just plain annoyed.  

So how do I propose we balance this?  I think that my quest for balance starts with a little compromise on the part of the FIU and GC administration and the students themselves.  It's certainly neither fair nor appealing to have the student center a sterile, dreary dungeon. 
 
At the same time, though, neither is the near nightclub scene that takes place every other day there.   I think that kind of atmosphere reflects poorly on FIU and the student body in general.  

If, when I was visiting schools to decide which one to attend, I had come to FIU on a day when "Club FIU" was in full swing, I may not have given this school any serious consideration.  FIU is a university, a place of higher learning.  

The scene at the pit does not encourage growth and maturity in the student body but instead keeps it in a high school "party mode."

I'm not saying we can't have fun and get away from our studies, but, as with most things, we should do so in moderation.  The first thing we need to change is the music itself.  It's always the same type and always at ear-splitting volume levels.

We need variety of music that can appeal to all types of students ‚Äì something more conducive to an academic environment.  Either way, it shouldn't be played so loudly that you can feel the bass shaking your internal organs and the treble devastating your eardrums.  

There have been occasions when I have taken my books outside to enjoy the sunshine while studying and could literally hear every word, note, and monotonous thumping beat of the music playing in the Graham Center Pit;   which is ridiculous when you consider that I was sitting all the way over by Chemistry and Physics building.

After all of this, I feel like all that's left to say is the proverbial threat "If I have to pull this car over," but seriously, putting my, shall I say parental tendencies aside, the GC atmosphere does need to change.

It should be a place to take a relaxing break or eat a pleasant lunch with friends.  

I shouldn't feel like I need to show my ID to bouncers, pay a cover charge and get a hand stamp when I come through the doors.

Students need to be exposed to new things--broaden their horizons. 

While you can't force feed culture to someone, you can at least set it out on the table and make it available.  

So let's try to bring FIU up to the levels and standards of other universities in the country not strive to be the best place to get your groove on during class break.

Headline: Columnist welcomes new wave of feminism
Author: Andrea MartiniStaff Columnist
&nbsp;
For many years, I harbored a sort of dislike towards feminism or women's rights groups.  I thought the approaches these groups took towards changing women's role in society were far too extreme.

The choices seem to have been simply divided between groups who focused on emphasizing the victimization of women, and groups of women who just wanted to be equal or better than men in every single way. Either way, they all seem too radical in their views.

To me, feminism is not about trashing men or wanting to be like them.  My concept of feminism is embodied in an independent spirit, independent enough to not feel like a victim or to allow anybody to treat me as such.  My feminist side wanted to be a strong human being without leaving my femininity aside and becoming like a man.

Well, nowadays things are getting a little better and many women's rights groups are inspiring a more powerful and avant-garde attitude towards the victimization of women.

V-Day is one of these movements.  I praise their serious efforts to tackle truly serious problems like rape, female genital mutilation, battery and other forms of abuse against women.

I think these are the issues that really matter, rather than women complaining if they are portrayed as sex toys in magazines or the media.
  
V-Day centers on the importance in educating women to perceive themselves as human beings and it does not concentrate on portraying them as victims.

Yes, there are women all over the world who are abused, but only concentrating on this can actually make the female sex weaker.  Focusing on preventing the abuse and taking strong measures to bring these important women's issues to light is a more inspirational and uplifting resolution.

This organization upholds the principles of female creativity and confidence.  In my opinion, that is the best way to become a feminist.  To set yourself free and make your own choices, without ludicrous ideas like competing with men.  This kind of independence and freedom is what can really allow you to feel, not just the power of being a woman, but the power of being a strong individual.

V-Day has spread around the world through promoting artistic events, for which they fundraise.  One of the main events they are promoting this year in order to spread their messgae is the performance of "The Vagina Monologues" throughout the world.

The group places a lot of importance on open expression about female genitalia because they believe women must begin true liberation by becoming comfortable with their sexuality.

 Although this concept is a little eccentric for my taste (saying "vagina" out loud does not make me feel more empowered), I can't help but admire the organization's boldness in displaying an innovative attitude with concepts like The Vulva Choir.  This one presents a variety of singers, dancers and performers such as Claire Danes, Glenn Close, Melissa Etheridge and many others.

The organization is also involved with many other important campaigns, like the Stop The Rape Contest, for instance, which is witty and strong.  It is a contest dedicated to ending violence against women like rape and spreading awareness of the matter in an engaging way. The name of each campaign evokes independence and the essence of womanhood.

The best thing I find about this movement is their willingness to work with men towards ending violence against women.  They are very clear in saying that their only concern is violence toward women, but they also recognize the benefits that male participation can bring to the movement.

This is very important because abuse requires two people.  The abuser and the abused person.  It is not enough to teach women how to prevent abuse.  It is very important for men to inspire other men to stop abuse against women.  I think this is a very powerful method.

So, I no longer have an excuse.  I can finally participate in a cause to support women's rights and feel like I want to graduate and be an independent woman, but, I can also be woman enough to find a good man and stand by his side and raise children.

I no longer feel like I have to choose between doing what I want and being part of a pro-women group.  Truly powerful women can do all these things at once because having no limitations is what makes you an individual.

This is what I was looking for all along.

Headline: Dazzling Quidam reinvents circus
Author: Venus Goicoechea / Business Manager
&nbsp;
When I think about what goes on under the big top, the first things that come to mind are clowns, acrobats, elephants, lions, tigers and bears. But Cirque Du Soleil is not your typical circus, so forget the animals and get ready for a theatrical performance with contortionists and acrobats that seem to defy the laws of nature with their strength and agility.  

Cirque du Soleil is a Montreal-founded company, working from the idea of giving the typical circus an artsy French twist. When first entering the tent to witness its latest production, "Quidam," you are overwhelmed by the visual spectacle and the intimacy the stage offers. The show begins with the main clown joking with the audience and setting a darkly funny mood for the whole show. When all the performers are on stage at once it resembles a lavish Broadway production with beautiful voices and a live orchestra freely sampling the sounds of many different cultures.

"Quidam" is about the dreamer inside us singing out loud. The loose plot resembles "Alice in Wonderland" in many ways, with the idea of a little girl traveling through marvelously picturesque lands and watching amazing spectacles. The acts themselves surprise the audience with vivid, other-worldly colors. The various acts included acrobats with a long rope hanging from the roof. Other aspects of the show included a beautiful woman performing in the air sustained by long, wide pieces of silk.

The main plot thread examines the typical family: Mother, father and daughter. The show makes a comment on how people get caught up on what's really not important in life and take those around them for granted. The story follows the daughter wandering through these spectacles and exhibitions, like through a good, old-fashioned acid trip. 

Music, like in any musical show, has a big impact in the development of the story and its ideas. "Quidam's" band really made me feel what the performers were trying to convey. Whether it is a scene up in the air or a comedic performance on the stage, the music keeps the crowd in suspense as to what is going to happen next. It's like a boat that keeps the crowd floating throughout the show and guides them to the next adventure. 

Many performers need to be praised, but none more than the clowns. They didn't make much use of their English but everyone speaks the language of laughter. And it is all about laughter: In the end, happily, we see the family reunited in a very pleasant atmosphere, filled with love and compassion.

Headline: Creed cooks up recipe for rock drivel
Author: Alex Segura, Jr. / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Music buyers are not a wily lot. They never will be. Yet you can't help but wonder what Creed does that makes the girls swoon and the boys play air guitar. It can't be their sound. I liked it better when it was called Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. It can't be their brooding good looks. The Doors did that years ago. It can't be their talent. Then again, talent doesn't always equate to record sales. Look at Yanni.

For eight weeks Weathered sat atop the Billboard charts. Creed has succeeded where similar poetry spouting, guitar crunching and mood swinging bands have flopped. Creed are the anti-rock stars. They're punk's worst nightmare. 

Like the Journeys, Chicagos and Bostons before them, Creed have given up whatever anti-establishment stance is still left in rock and basked in the generalities that have gotten them this far. I would safely say that only the most hard core Creedlodyte could describe in detail how My Own Prison, Human Clay and Weathered differ from each other musically. Or how they differ from a stack of Alice in Chains or Candlebox b-sides. 

Like most bands lately, Creed has reversed rock rebellion. Classic punks like the Sex Pistols and the Clash fought the excesses of prog-rock by bringing music back to it's simpler, harder roots. Creed is taking it to the next level.  With their sellout mentality, brooding Catholic school-boy spiritualism and homogenous persona, they've built a machine that is the anti-rock band. 

They're not the first band to do this, nor are they the only one doing it now. Creed leads the pack of faceless bands like Tantric, Staind, Slipknot, Linkin Park and Papa Roach. Could anyone aside from hard core n√º rock fanboys be able to point them out in a lineup of future hasbeens? Probably not. 

The most irksome thing about Creed isn't their glaring lack of talent or invisible sense of humor. It's that they actually take themselves seriously. Poor suckers. They think their music actually matters. 

If you're going to produce unoriginal cock-rock, at least have fun with it. Take a page from the Whitesnake and Bon Jovi handbooks: If you're making mad money off music that will only sell for a few years, you might as well have a little fun while you're at it.

Headline: Generic Crossroads sends wrong message
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
I've changed my mind about movies not being a direct cause of violent behavior. After sitting through each and every gut-wrenching minute of "Crossroads," I had the undying urge to pop someone in the mouth. It was downright eerie, walking out of the theater and looking at each person as they brush past you and wondering, "God, would it be that bad if I just punched that guy?"

You psychology majors may call that transference. Clearly I don't want to deck anyone in the theater (okay, maybe that guy with the "Mission: Impossible" ring on his cell phone, but only him). In fact, all this hostility should be aimed at the cast and crew and just about anyone associated with the production of this worthless pile of drivel. Yes, even the caterer should be harmed for his involvement. It was that bad a movie.

"Crossroads" is a road trip movie that never gets onto the freeway, preferring to drive really slowly through the parking lot instead, with an occasional speed bump or two jostling the ride. Lucy (Britney Spears) is a beautiful valedictorian who wants to pursue studies in music, despite her father (Dan Ackroyd) wanting her to be a doctor. Her ex-best friends get together on the night of their graduation to unearth a time capsule they made ten years earlier with their dreams and wishes inside.

Lucy's wish was to see the mother she hadn't seen since age three. Punky, pregnant, white trash Mimi (Taryn Manning, looking disturbingly like a teenage Margot Kidder) just wants to see the Pacific Ocean. Prissy, popular girl Kit (Zoe Saldana) wants to get married (she's engaged to a college student in UCLA that you know is cheating on her because they fight on the phone). And somehow, despite hating each other immensely, they all decide that it'd be a good idea to hop into a car with a guy they don't know (think Wes Bentley with hemorrhoids, on steroids) and help their untalented friend Mimi get to a singing audition in Los Angeles.

If you can't figure out where this story goes, stop reading this article right here because you cannot possibly hold the mental capacity for English. The amount of thought that went into this film‚Ä¶well, I put more thought and effort into answering the question "Should I punch myself in the face, today?"

I repeat, it was that bad a movie.

One of the early scenes has Spears preparing to have sex with a really dorky looking guy on her graduation night (which for some reason appears to be prom night, too). He actually reads a list to her as to why they should do it. For a few moments, I thought "Crossroads" was about to become a zany comedy, something like "American Pie" meets "Road Trip," but with female leads. But then I realized this was being played for serious purposes. We were really supposed to believe she'd consider having sex with a guy because they'd "been lab partners for three years and really trust each other." I reiterate once more, it was that bad a movie.

I heard in an interview that Spears spent one week with an acting coach before shooting this film, and it shows. She can bug her eyes out, give a soft "Aww, I'm caring" look and cry on cue like the best of them. Unfortunately, if she isn't doing one of the three (which isn't very often), her talent comes to a screeching halt, with this vacant stare that (I hate to say something so stereotypical) reminds me of the typical "bimbo cheerleader after being asked a really hard question" look. She may, in fact, possess talents outside of her bra, but she sure as hell wasn't trying to hone them here.

The end of the movie is an emotional downer. Sure, it tries to be happy, but after the hugely dramatic, over-the-top tearjerker incidents just 10 minutes earlier, no musical number can restore the film to its fluffiness. Unless you think rape and miscarriages can be solved with a hit Britney Spears single. Wait, is that giving too much away? Oops, too late. My point is, the true message of this movie, right down to the very last scene before the credits, is "Wishes suck, so don't wish for them because you may not get what you want, but a lot of bad stuff  too." What the hell kind of message is that? Again, it was a bad a movie.

But tragically, no matter how bad a movie it was, I must admit, I have seen far worse. And that scares me.

Headline: Triumphant Afripalooza brings laughter to Valentine's Day
Author: Rebecca Martin/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Valentine's night: Metropolitan chaos of men and women striving, at great lengths, to reiterate their love for one another. Or the most fervent night of denial for those of us who are, as I like to put it, a little lonelier. I am 336 miles away from my boyfriend, so Valentine's night brought me to the University Park comedy show, Afripalooza II. Surrounded by my "a-little-lonelier" group of friends, I hoped for something to get my mind off the flowers, the red landscape and that four-letter word of the day: love.

What a night. The audience, composed of several "a-little-loneliers" and a few "cheap-date-couples," were much in need of laughs and an outlet for their animal competitiveness. The Student Programming Council (SPC), the sponsors of Afripalooza II, began the night by throwing free t-shirts at the lively crowd. Moved by something other than love, a few more four-letter words and numerous catfights arose. 

Our host, Mike Yard, proved to be more than just funny. Yard had everyone rolling in their seats. Self-proclaimed "different" and "a fantasy type," Mike Yard's material came primarily from cultural differences, the current war in Afghanistan, his life in Brooklyn and any play off the audience that he could take.	

As for the performer known as Mariposa, I think she scared people more than entertained them. Given that she is a poet and not necessarily trying to be funny, her material is profound and focused. However, she is simply offensive. You could practically hear all the men in the room slide down in their seats during "I Feel Sexy," and anyone without "hair that has soul" tried to disappear for the seven-minute lapse of "Broken Eyes, Broken Promises." 

After Yard briefly saved the audience from bursting into tears, Jay Phillips got them rolling again. From Baltimore, Phillips began his set by playing off Busta Rhymes and the other "bling bling boys." He thinks that DMX needs a hug and left the audience breathless from laughter with his take on Sisqo. But when Jay Phillips sang and danced, the act took that one step up, so it deserved the standing ovation.

My absolute favorite of the night was Andrew Kennedy. The man is half-British, half-Colombian, raised in countless Latin countries and Hong Kong. His jokes showed the diversity of education he received while growing up. His multi-faceted talent truly stole the show when he sang "Amazing Grace" in a perfect gospel-preacher voice, and his ability to capture and hold an audience was incredible. 

Ventriloquist ("French for gynecologist") Willie Brown and his dummy, Woody, are from LA, where the jokes about homeless people hopefully go over better. Brown has amazing ventriloquist talent, proven when he had Woody on his knee and was answering a cell phone at the same time (you could actually hear Brown's voice on the cell phone), but after ten minutes of homeless jokes, nothing he said received more than a polite chuckle. Like a breath of fresh air, Willie Brown saved his act with a sketch of "Woody for President" wherein the dummy pretends to be running for President and answers the audience's questions about anything they want to know. 

And then there was Freddy Ricks. Raised in the South Bronx, everything was a culture shock for Ricks growing up. To put it mildly, he's "got problems" and is "disturbed" when he goes into some very dark humor. He definitely lost the audience a couple times, but came back with sketches on Harriet Tubman's impatience and a new take on Willy Wonka's "The Candyman" song. 

Three hours of (almost) nonstop laughter was the perfect way to end this Valentine's Day for anyone ‚Äì the "a-little-loneliers," the "cheap-date-couples," the "late-night-wanderers" of the campus. The SPC should be commended for Afripalooza II: It was a huge success. I will definitely be at the next comedy show, April 11th, and recommend that everyone at FIU be there as well.

Headline: Slight Sisters of Hialeah examines Latin stereotypes
Author: Amanda Healy/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU Theater's adaptation of the Michel Tremblay play "Les Belles Soeures," "Sisters of Hialeah," was the perfect antidote to the Valentine's Day blues. It was just pure laughs. The audience did not have to think much, or analyze a plot line (there hardly was one) ‚Äì only laugh. 

Tremblay has written many other plays, including "Le Train," "In Spare Parts" and "Old Odors." "Les Belles Soeures" is one of Tremblay's first, however. FIU Theater has revamped this Canadian play and moved the setting to Hialeah, 1979. The scene is a middle-class Hispanic home. The woman who lives there has just won a million trade-in stamps and needs help pasting them all, so she holds a "stamp pasting party" with her "closest" friends. Through the course of this tale, everyone's true colors come out, including those of the woman ‚Äì she just paints her toes the whole time while everyone else does the work. By the end of the night, there are several stolen stamps and hot tempers fly. 

The play's main source of humor is Spanish stereotyping, used in a "Saturday Night Live" way. It's very funny while commenting on Hispanic behavior ‚Äì it's the in-between parts that are dull. 

However, when attempting to view the play as a whole, it does not look so good. The story ends right where it began; there is absolutely no resolution to any of the conflicts ‚Äì and there were many of those. In fact, it seems Tremblay was desperately grabbing for some sort of meaningful lesson or two to include in his writing and so threw in several scenarios that had the potential for depth, but unfortunately ended up falling short. These include loneliness, greed, mother-daughter clashing, a washed-up showgirl, an unwed, pregnant Catholic teen and the value of true friendship. No theme was dominant, however, or even concluded by the play's end. They were all just tossed into the script like a salad. 

On a more positive note, Tremblay does use an interesting technique; he has many character monologues, reminiscent of Ancient Greek theatre. These asides allowed the audience to see more into the souls of the characters and to get to know them, but ultimately ended up not doing much for the story overall. They were great as individual monologues, but not together. If every scene is viewed separately from one another, as a series of comedic skits in a comedy show, then the writing is simply side-splitting, tear-jerking, belly-aching funny. Some scenarios were just an eruption of pure chaos. It was great. 

The best scene of all is from Act 2. It is about the housewives' obsession with the game "Bingo." Their lives are so dull and tortuous that "Bingo" has become an orgasmic pleasure. It was hilarious. The characters really are excellent, each incredibly funny in her own way, but it was not the stuff of a well-written play, only an entertaining sketch with a Latino twist. 

 Don't blame the theater department. The entire cast is full of energy and the will to entertain. There is not a poor actress on stage. The costumes are just as hilarious as the dialogue ‚Äì very well put together. There are even sound effects and a videotaped pre-show to set the mood. No expense or effort is spared by the cast and crew of FIU. The presentation is flawless. If the play could stand on visual gags and absurd theatre alone, then it would be fine.

Nonetheless, the good points of this show are enough to lighten the spirits of any wary theatre-goer. It brought a few laughs, allowed a little fun ‚Äì so who's complaining, right?
