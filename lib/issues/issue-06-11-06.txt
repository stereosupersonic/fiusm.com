Headline: BEATING THE ODDS: After posting a 19-13 record last season with a first round loss against the University of Miami in thepostseason Women's National Invitational Tournament, these Golden Panthers are looking to improve upon that nominal success.
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The only thing standing in their way is themselves as injuries to five key players will place the team at half-strength until after the holiday break, according to coach Cindy Russo, who enters her 28th season at the helm of the women's basketball team.

"Right now I'd just be really happy to get healthy," Russo said. "It's just such a drudgery and it's been so tough to practice. We've been throwing our [assistant] coaches out there in practice and even our assistant coaches are injured now. I think we had three practices where everybody was healthy."

This season's team is practically the same team as last season, the main difference being the loss of point guard Faeza Bouderra to graduation. 

However, Iva Ciglar is ready to take over the vacant position. The sophomore saw action in every game last season - including 10 starts - and averaged 24.2 minutes per game. 

With even more playing time, Ciglar will improve upon her 8.3 point-per-game average - which was fifth on the team last season.

Ciglar said she worked on her shot release and tried to increase the use of her left hand during the off-season.

Guards LaQuetta Ferguson, Asha Neal and Eva Makela are expected to see plenty of time in the backcourt, but are three of the key players out with injuries for the first few weeks of the season.

For the time being, sophomores Antonia Zeigler and Ashley Traugott, as well as freshman sharpshooter Monika Bosilij from Croatia, will carry the backup duties.

Freshman Khadija Jackson, team MVP last year at Miami Senior High School, should see some playing time as well.

Preseason All-Sun Belt second team honoree Lasma Jekabsone, who lead the team with 15.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, will see the bulk of the time at center. Her 91 blocked shots last season set a new single-season school record. 

Despite leading the Sun Belt Conference in blocks per game (3.15), free throw percentage (79.4) and defensive rebounds per game (6.93), Jekabsone this season is looking to improve her free throw percentage and offensive rebounding.

"My goal is to get more rebounds," Jekabsone said. "Since this year we have many players who can score [from the outside] â€¦ there must be somebody to rebound so they can feel safe to take those shots."

Jekabsone said she will not be that focused on scoring, because opponents will probably double-team her and so many of her teammates have scoring ability.

Liene Bersone, who spent the majority of last season as Jekabsone's mate in the low post as a starter, is another key player out with injury to start the season, which increases the rest of the team's reliance on Jekabsone's rebounding.

Sophomore forward Marquita Adley, who is also out with injury, played key minutes last season coming off the bench and should reprise an increased role and may even become a starter upon her return. 

She was second on the team in steals and blocks, and averaged 6 points and 6.5 rebounds in just over 19 minutes of action per game.

Forward Gordana Bedalov, typically a low-post player, will likely start the season at the small forward position because of the injuries to other players.

Freshman Elisa Carey, a Miami Herald All-Dade First Team selection last season for Gulliver Prep, will see increased playing time in the beginning because of the injuries.

Junior Jasmine Jenkins, who has seen limited time the past two seasons, should have an increased role as well.

According to Russo, not counting the injuries, the team has no glaring weakness or strengths, for that matter.

"I think we're just well rounded," Russo said. "We can shoot. We can run. We are aggressive on defense. We, right now, are nowhere like we will be when we get healthy."

Ciglar added, "I'm pretty sure we're not the only team who's going through a tough situation like this. You just have to adapt and overcome. We'll see who's going to step up [and] try top get the spot of the people who are injured."

Headline: Men's soccer ousted from C-USA tournament
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer season is finished. No more practices at MDC-Kendall; no more screaming fans at the University Park Soccer Stadium.

The Golden Panthers (6-9-2, 2-7 Conference USA) hoped to capture a conference title when the season began, but those dreams are no more. The only thing remaining from the campaign is the still-stinging 6-0 thrashing that Southern Methodist (16-1-3, 5-1-2) provided to close FIU's season. 

In the first round of the C-USA Men's Soccer Championship, the top-seeded Mustangs gave the Golden Panthers the biggest loss in tournament history and an early ticket out of Tulsa, Okla.

"I have absolutely no rational explanation for that game," head coach Karl Kremser said when the team returned to Miami. "The last time we faced them, we were battling for every ball and were never late. But that didn't happen in the last game."

The match greatly differed from the previous face-off. When the two teams met Sept. 29 at the UP Soccer Stadium, SMU escaped with a 3-2 double-overtime victory.

But they left nothing to chance in the conference tournament and scored six goals in two separate 15-minute bursts of offense.

"Early in the game I turned to [assistant coach] Munga Eketebi and said, 'This game could turn ugly.'"

Ugly is exactly what soon followed. Mustang midfielder Bruno Guarda started a goal stampede with a strong finisher in the 21st minute. After senior goalkeeper Shawn Crowe made a diving save, Guarda knocked in the rebound to give SMU a 1-0 lead. 

Minutes later, sophomore forward Paulo da Silva replicated Guarda's goal and sent another rebound shot crashing into the right netting.

As if that weren't enough, senior defender Jay Needham added to the scoring blitz in the 35th minute. On a Chase Wileman corner-kick, sophomore midfielder Jeff Harwell made a precise pass to Needham, who easily tapped the ball in from his position directly in front of goal. 

FIU suddenly faced a three-goal deficit to one of the best teams in the country.

"We got down and started chasing afterwards. Once you start chasing a team like SMU, you're in deep trouble," Kremser said. "You can't play as cautiously and have to take more chances. You expose your defense because you're trying to get back. 

"They exploited that. SMU's the [No. 2] team in the country for a reason."

Halftime did little to make SMU relent.

The team's barrage of 34 shots tripled the 11 that FIU finished the game with.

The Golden Panthers earned only three shots-on-goal, a figure their opponent surpassed in a few minutes of action several times during the match.

Sophomore forward Manuel Mariel scored twice in the second half, including a 75th minute tally and an 89th minute strike following a run from midfield. 

Senior midfielder Jordan Mann added to the score in the 81st minute by blasting a 20-yard shot straight into the middle of the goal.

"It's unfortunate because through all the injuries, no exhibition games, and playing the top teams in the country, we were always in the game this year," Kremser said. "This is the one game where we were just out if completely. It's the one time you can say that we were just plain bad."

The blow-out loss finalized a disappointing season for FIU. Despite signature wins against bitter rival Florida Atlantic and previously ranked Memphis, the team never put together the consistent run necessary to be ranked among the elite.

The Golden Panthers lost a match by one goal eight times, five of which came in the last 15 minutes of regulation or overtime. 

In fact, a late-season collapse is what sent the men's soccer team into its match against SMU.

FIU lost its three final games - each by one goal - and went from being a potential third or fourth seed in the C-USA Championship to barely qualifying for the tournament at all.

The team finished the season as far away from its goals as anyone could have anticipated.

FIU had a legitimate shot to contend for the C-USA title when the season began.

But the Golden Panthers will end the 2006 campaign with their first losing record since 1989.

"The season and the way it ended was disappointing," Kremser said. "[The ride back to Miami] was quiet. There was nothing you could really say about a game like that.

"But I wanted the players to remember how much I appreciated how much they battled all year."

Headline: Coach Rouco and team have high hopes for season
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Following a tough 2005-2006 season that saw the team struggle to a 7-20 mark - including an 11-game losing streak - coach Sergio Rouco and the men's basketball team enter the season looking to have the best season in Rouco's three-year tenure. 

With the loss of star forward Ivan Almonte to graduation, the team will look to fill a void on the boards that they had not had to worry about the past two seasons.

More bad news came FIU's way as junior center Kenny Simms was ruled ineligible for the season because of academic struggles.

Look for guard Johwen Villegas to see increased playing time as the Golden Panthers try to find an identity early on.

The senior from Puerto Rico saw increased time last year coming off the bench, hitting critical three-point shots for Rouco's team.

Villegas and fellow countryman Alex Galindo, a transfer from Kansas who had to sit out last season because of NCAA regulations, both were named to the Sun Belt's Preseason All-Conference third team. 

"He is a tremendous shooter, so that is going to improve. I want him to pick it up a little bit defensively. Villegas is a senior and a big key to helping us win this season," Rouco said.

Galindo, a 6'7" forward, could be the player FIU has been waiting for. With a solid shot from behind the line, he could be the one to lead this team, come conference play.

"He has played at the highest level. He knows what it takes to win. We don't need him to be a statistical leader, but a motivational and team leader," Rouco said. "He has the knowledge of what it takes to be great team player and help us win games." 

Sophomore point guard Elvis Lora returns along with junior Chris Fuller, two men that saw increased time in the backcourt as last season progressed. 

Look for Lora to step up his quick play as he faces pressure at the position from Junior College transfer Dejon Prejean who follows in the footsteps of graduated senior Ismael N'Diaye from Los Angeles City College.

Both men will show speed in the backcourt, but look for Lora to find his stroke and lead this team for the majority of the season. 

"Defense wins games; whenever we get our defense right everything will come natural on offense," Lora said.

Argentine forward Facundo Giorgi returns to a frontcourt that will be without a proven center. Giorgi showed his shooting touch last season but struggled with consistency and play inside the post.

Expect him to step up with a lack of presence in the paint. 

The 6'9" Serbian freshmen Nikola Gacesa could be the man that steps into the center role as the season progresses, but he may struggle, like most freshmen, to  adjust to the speed of the college game. 

It might not be until late in the season that we see him progress into a good presence inside. 

"He is a freshman. He is learning American basketball and terminology. He is just a puppy freshman right now and he will be great in the future," Rouco said.

Once this team can find its identity, one that is missing following the Almonte era, look for this team to improve on the miserable 4-11 record they managed in the Sun Belt last season. Following a disappointing showing and first round loss in the conference tournament, Rouco will look to steer this team in the right direction as they will be thrown straight into a tough out-of-conference schedule. 

The early season sees an opener at the University of Miami Nov. 11 followed by a road battle at Robert Morris Nov.13 before the Tip Off Classic hosted by FIU at Pharmed Arena Nov. 17-18.

The team will then close out November with three road games - South Florida, Kennesaw State and George Mason - before a Dec. 2 visit to Madison, Wis., to face perennial Big Ten power house Wisconsin.

The conference schedule begins Dec. 17 with a bout with Troy, one of the four teams FIU beat last season in the Conference, followed by instate opponent Palm Beach Atlantic to close out the out-of-conference schedule.

The Golden Panthers will be thrown into the Sun Belt schedule with a home meeting against rivals Florida Atlantic University Dec. 28, before a New Year's Eve match-up with Middle Tennessee. 

It will then be all conference games, finishing with a Feb. 24 battle in Bowling Green, Ky. with Western Kentucky.

Headline: Review: FIU Symphony Orchestra (Concert)
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
The FIU 11th annual Music Festival kicked off its series of 12 concerts with an impressive performance from the FIU Symphony Orchestra and other guest performers. 

The Nov. 2 concert's program included pieces from Brahms, Kaufman and Beethoven with the inclusion of guest performers from locales that ranged from local high schools to Israel. The first piece, however, showcased the FIU Symphony Orchestra on its own. 

In Johannes Brahms's "Academic Festival" overture (an appropriate piece to start a university-wide event series), the piece starts with staccato and almost foreboding notes that give way to reveal a very fluid minor melody. The tones and colors in the piece were solidly delivered -Â a feature that the orchestra, especially the string section, could boast throughout the concert. The piece segues and swells into a majestic, nearly fanfare-like theme, which almost welcomed the audience to the event, but didn't prepare them for the departure that was to come. 

Fredrick Kaufman's "Kaddish" begins with a very haunting cello solo that is a series of non-linear notes, which echoed mysteriously through the concert hall. Guest cellist Yehuda Hanani from Israel nearly leapt off of his chair in performing the stark, intense notes that turned the music from notes on a page into an intangible feeling of high tension. 

The basses creep in what sounds like a slow version of the Jaws theme and pizzicato and flourishes of chaos from the violins provided a very strange atmosphere. The frequent use of extended harmonic notes almost sounded like feedback or a distant teakettle. In essence, the piece sounded like if you played it backwards you'd hear it in a Beatles song.  However, the fact that it wasn't a "crowd pleaser" in the style of Mozart or Bach made it a bold choice to use in a season opener - refreshing, in fact. Nevertheless, it was the grand style of Beethoven that brought the concert to a close. 

Ludwig van Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony" is not an easy piece to tackle. For the classical music fan, its "Ode to Joy" theme is as frequently heard as the "Happy Birthday" song. 

In the Allegro ma non troppo movement, the first performed, the beginning attack was not as fierce as it's sometimes performed and lacked crispness because of a lack in unity. The dynamics followed suit in this movement, without as many swells and ebbs as other pieces, making the piece sound mostly mezzo forte. However, the mastery of the notes by the performers truly aided in showcasing what a Beethoven piece should be: beautiful overlapping melodies that rush over the listener in small waves that eventually turn into the grand wall of sound as promised. 

The molto vivace movement, a favorite among them, began with a great tempo choice for the agitated cascading triplets from the strings and additions from percussion. It was the best display of the symphony listening to each other and working together as an entity. At times, it was also pretty rocking. 

The Adagio molto e cantabile movement had a pastoral quality in line with the strengths from the group. This slow, melodic piece had a way to almost cleanse the aural palette and had very pretty flourishes and harmonies from the wind and brass. 

The Presto movement sends chills running down your spine. It's the complete classical music experience with solo vocalists and chorus to add to the wall of sound. The "Ninth Symphony" has a great sentiment that comes across in both lyrics and music that pretty much depicts the struggle to overcome and end victoriously. It begins angrily and almost painfully and ends with a release of exaltation. The orchestra, along with guests from the Miami Master Chorale and the Coral Reef Senior High School Orchestra, were able to accomplish this feat, but ran into the same problem that many performers of this piece have - it's been done before, and probably better. 

 However, the execution was truly solid and enjoyable -Â a great kick-off to what will be in store for the next couple of weeks.

Headline: Duran Duran, Daft Punk to perform at Miami music fest
Author: Samantha QuiÃ±on / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Hundreds of people will cram into Bicentennial Park on Saturday, Nov. 11 to attend the Bang Music Festival. Over the course of 13 hours, more than 50 popular and up and coming bands will be playing full sets, each lasting none less than an hour, on five stages. 

The size of the festival and its eclectic quality has many music fans in Miami excited, including senior Jessica Alvarez.

"I like a lot of the bands that are playing," she said. "I like Gnarls Barkley for sure and Duran Duran, and I've heard little snippets of everyone else ... Big Bang Radio and Atomic Tangerine are good, too. Some of those lesser bands are really good, and I hope people get to go and see them."

It seems, however, that while Bang Fest supports the performances of local "lesser" bands, they are counting on the big names to draw in the numbers. 

"We're bringing something that doesn't exist into South Florida," said Lisa Nevin, a marketing coordinator with Bang Music Festival. "You've got your underground hip-hop with Gnarls Barkley and Common. You've Duran Duran, and they still have that '80s feel. If you like reggae, there's Damien Marley. [There's] Tiesto for house [music]. There's Modest Mouse for indie rock ... There's something for everyone." 

Despite the presence of these popular artists, people seem most eager for Daft Punk's performance.

"[The festival] just seems like it's gonna be a lot of bad stuff and a little bit of good stuff, like Daft Punk, for me at least," said Joseph Garst, events coordinator for WRGP Radiate FM, who has been active on campus in promoting the radio station's sponsorship of the festival.

"I only bought my ticket to see Daft Punk," said sophomore Molly Wu. "I heard their performance is going to be just like the one they did at Coachella."

The performance of which Wu speaks is Daft Punk's last live performance at the Coachella Valley Arts and Music Festival this past April, in which the duo performed inside a massive transparent pyramid, dressed in their traditional robot garb.

Nevin confirmed Wu's anticipation, adding that Daft Punk has announced that Bang Fest will be their last live performance.

"There will be five stages," she said. "Two live stages and a smaller one for the local bands. Then [there's the] Tiesto Stage for the house [music] and the Daft Punk Stage for trance [music]. Then [there's] a breakbeat tent. Basically, [Daft Punk] wanted a huge stage for their show, so we gave it to them â€¦ It's going to be just like the one they did at Coachella."

But not everyone who wants to see Daft Punk is going.

Senior Jerzy Berodzikowsky will not be attending Bang Music Fest.

"The tickets are outrageously expensive," he said. "Basically too much for a student's wallet â€¦ I may still go, but only if I find $80 lying around somewhere. I'd really love to see Daft Punk."

Ticket prices are now up to $75, not including tax and service charges from ticket outlets.

For those who do have a ticket, Nevin had a few words of advice.

"Bring a small purse or backpack," she said. "But know you're going to be with it all day long. There will be ATMs and all sorts of vendors for food and drinks and beer and merch, so you may want a little place to put it, so you don't have to carry it around the whole time."

Headline: Controversial comedy show tackles racial stereotypes
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The controversial comedy show "N*gger, Wetb*ck, Ch*nk" was performed at the Graham Center Ballroom Nov. 1. The performance pulled no punches in delivering biting humor along with an uncompromising message about race in our society.

The team of Miles Gregley, Allan Axibal and Rafael Agustin formed about two and a half years ago in Los Angeles and has been touring college campuses all around the country.  Their no-holds-barred comedic approach to racism and stereotypes is coupled with a powerful message that urged the audience to think twice about what makes all humans the same.

"We went to performing art centers and saw that college was our audience," said Gregley.

While the show has garnered much critical acclaim, it does not overshadow its controversy. Some police officers were present at the ballroom. Axibal recalled one performance where picketers who originally protested the show's content ended up watching the performance.

"They said that they got the wrong idea and they loved it," he said.

One could easily mistake the message of the show at first. From race cards to list games, NWC pulled out nearly every single racial joke in the book while also using song, poetry and physical comedy with the performers' real life experiences to balance the humor and seriousness of the very delicate subject matter. Many of the skits touched on the performers trying to cast off their heritage in order to fit in with whites and in the end, embracing their roots as a minority.

The response from the audience was seemingly positive. After the show, the cast engaged with a brief question and answer session with students. Even after that, students were still able to talk with the performers and pose questions and comments as well as ask for autographs and take pictures with the performers.

"It was great. It broke all the rules in the right way," said freshman John Guzman.

NWC's current tour is running until next spring, but a 2008 tour is currently being planned. While the show is always the same, there are always new and different responses from audiences in the various locations. Given the nature of the show, many of the skits can be interpreted differently by people's own experience with race.

"We get nervous every time. The audience is the fourth character," said Agustin.  "It's different every time."

NWC attempts to reach everyone with the message of "only one race - the human race" to college campuses around the country. While people may be scared to say the name of the show out loud in public, as the very title of the show can be seen as offensive, such a bold risk is in fact the show's intended appeal.

Headline: Club helps children, homeless
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Vanessa Cardenas recalls herself guiding an autistic child on a horse through a field in Homestead. Despite the difficulty in connecting with others - a struggle most autistics experience - Cardenas feels that, over the course of an hour on this particular day, they came to recognize her and appreciate her assistance. 

"You kind of grow a close relationship with them," she said. "They get kind of attached to you." 

This event, called Horses for the Handicapped, was Cardenas' first time working with autistic children. She got this opportunity through her involvement as vice president of the community service group Circle K at FIU. Circle K is an international club developed in 1947 whose FIU chapter began three years ago. 

The organization works under the umbrella of the adult organization Kiwanis, whose purpose is to "serve the children of the world," as their motto states. Her father's involvement in Kiwanis, in fact, is the very reason that FIU Circle K President Kerri Chin-Quee joined the student community service group in the first place. Cardenas explained how, in return for sponsorship, Circle K often helps clean Kiwanis' portion of a Miami highway or helps put their fund raisers together. 

Besides collaborating directly with Kiwanis, Horses for the Handicapped is only one of the recent events in which FIU's Circle K has invested its time. Every two months, Circle K also sets out for the beach, joining H.O.P.E. (Helping Overcome Poverty Everywhere) in feeding the homeless. Circle K's Secretary of Kiwanis Nohora Vanegas commented that this bimonthly encounter with those in need stands out in her mind as particularly meaningful. 

"We give them food, clothing and hygiene products," said Vanegas. "Most people come in with sad faces and they're all down, sick, hungry â€¦ They all leave with a full stomach and a smile on their face." 

Because Circle K makes a habit of this outreach, those to whom they offer aid already await them expectantly at the beach. 

Another of Circle K's activities is to partner with Children's Home Society, visiting underprivileged teenagers living in group homes. Sometimes it is as simple as hanging out with these youths at an FIU football game or a movie - extending friendship to them and attempting to influence their values.

On Nov. 11, the club is also making time to play with child patients at Jackson Memorial Hospital, creating art projects with them and performing a skit for them. Nov. 11 also happens to be the deadline for donations to Operation Christmas Child, to which Circle K contributes by filling shoeboxes with toys for children in developing countries. 

"Whenever they open their boxes, they're going to be really excited," Cardenas said.

As Circle K's officers, Chin-Quee, Cardenas and Vanegas all see recruitment as one of their major goals, in order to make the biggest impact possible and to give FIU's chapter a powerful reputation. They currently have 27 members.

"Last year all our members were seniors, so everyone graduated," Chin-Quee said. "It was hard [but] we reached that number [that we were aiming for] and it's been great." 

At the end of the day, Chin-Quee recognizes that no one organization can solve all of a community's complex issues. But Circle K is unwilling to accept that as an excuse for lack of action. 

"My favorite part is trying to save the world as much as I can," Chin-Quee said. "There's so much we can do." 

Students interested in joining Circle K can e-mail cki@fiu.edu or show up at their meetings on Wednesdays at 5 p.m. in the Graham Center 343. Although membership is ideal, students can also participate in selective events that interest them, even without membership. They can also learn more about Circle K at www.myspace.com/fiucirclek.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Cops committed to controlling crime
Author: Anastasia Wallace / Freshman / Undecided Major
&nbsp;
Crimes such as assault, burglary, and stalking have decreased since 2004, according to the article "Public Safety forum addresses students' fears." The population of FIU is growing and the need for more active officers is also growing. The officers at FIU are very devoted to their duty of looking out for the welfare of the FIU communityÂ­ - this plays a great role in the fact that crime is under control. 

When an incident occurred to my roommates and I last week, the officers came to our room in a short matter of time. We were grateful for the fact that people on campus were willing to assist us and protect us from any possible harm. The two officers stayed and cooperated with us, and eventually left after the situation was clarified; the officers displayed their commitment to us. I'd like to extend my appreciation to the officers on campus who are fulfilling their duty to serve FIU. Crime is under control, and if the officers continue with what they're doing, crime will not be an issue on our campus.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Another view on Lakeview residence
Author: Angie Leigh Shuck / Graduate Student / Foreign Language Education~TESOL
&nbsp;
After reading the article "After the move: New dorm invokes mixed feelings," I certainly had strong feelings. 

I am 26 years old and have lived in residence halls for the past eight years of my life, the last four with my husband. My life has consisted of being surrounded by college students and I have come to sincerely enjoy it.

I began as a freshman, luckily living in an air-conditioned residence hall. Many of my peers kept cool with box fans and open windows. But, you know what? It brought the residents together. They socialized because their doors were always open. They made the best of what they had and they were just thankful for the opportunity to live on campus.

After that, I lived in seven other residence halls - some all-female, some co-ed, one that was 26 floors and one with 400 male residents. The last two years we were there we lived in a building that had just been renovated. Sure, we had the little things that come along with the construction of anything, just like Lakeview, but everything finally got put in its place and it was a wonderful new home. Students respected their new surroundings and were truly excited to be a part of something new. I'm excited and proud to be part of the Lakeview community now. Lakeview is by far the nicest home I have ever had in a residence hall setting. I have seen first-hand the hard work and determination that was put into this project to make sure it opened in August when school began. It was only because of this hard work that we were all able to move on campus and begin our year.

I hope that the students here in Lakeview realize what they have - and from the article, it sounds like many do.

For those who haven't quite realized that they are living in the premiere residence hall in the state of Florida, I hope they will come to appreciate the experience of a lifetime.

The professional staff and student staff have been waiting for them such a long time and have planned great things to help in their transition to college. I can only hope that they take advantage of the opportunities that are offered and not sit back and watch their first year fly by without becoming involved in something. It makes a difference.

Headline: FIU's art program is out of film
Author: Ramon Alvarez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU has emerged as a cultural asset to the arts in South Florida over the past years. While it offers classes within the realm of theater, music, art and dance, one can only wonder why a film program has not been pursued. 

Â One can make the point that perhaps it takes time to allocate the necessary funding, or one can point out that FIU's infrastructure is not yet organized enough to implement new degree programs. 

Â In the best-case scenario, it would take at least $33,000 to set the program in motion. A large portion of the budget would be used to purchase the necessary equipment such as cameras, lights and other basics. 

"Even if the budget does get approved, it would take a year to gather the necessary funds and establish an adequate curriculum," said Jose Antonio Bueno, the dean of architecture and the arts.Â  

Â The time period between each semester is crucial. This gap between semesters is the time when FIU committees gather and propose possible new degree programs for the upcoming semester.

Â The main reason as to why the FIU film program has been sidelined is because of the University's infrastructure. Currently, the University is focused on finishing construction around campus and hiring faculty and staff to service these new facilities. Since FIU is focused on these endeavors, development of the film program has been put on hiatus.

Â Even if these problems did not exist, the question still remains: Does FIU need a film program? The short answer is yes.

"Film is an important link in communication and there are certain things that film allows you to communicate that can not be communicated otherwise," said Professor Phillip Church of the theater department.

As a medium of communication, film plays an important role in our society. It influences and informs people of a part of the world we all live in, but isn't acknowledged or understood. It is the purpose of a good film to convey a strong message, and engage the intellectual community. 

Â In FIU, a film program would better serve to unify the community and create a platform for free expression and intellectual thought. Even though there appears to be a strong desire to create a film program, it is evident that the program is still only under consideration. 

Hopefully, over time, more people will begin to see the merit and potential of a film program and the enriching experiences it could provide.

Headline: Graham Center Gallery celebrates 20th anniversary
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a celebration of the Graham Center Gallery's 10th anniversary, a special exhibit featured the works of Ana Galano and a sculpture by Craig Wedderspoon and was collectively called "Ella es ~ Tha Ã©" (she is ~ he is). The two artists are not only FIU alumni, but were also partially responsible for the founding of the GC Gallery. 

"We were invited back because of the anniversary and it feels like the closing of a circle," Galano said.

In addition to the various contemporary paintings and sculpture - one featuring a woman with an arrow through her head - the two artists wanted to display a page-long text detailing how the gallery came into being. Essentially, the text stated that FIU would not allow students to display their sculptures anywhere on campus because of exclusivity contracts with the Margulies Sculpture Collection.

The text also detailed how the various art students had to fight for space to display their art.

"We made a lot of noise," Wedderspoon said. "Ruth Hamilton offered us the space in the Graham Center in exchange for us stopping the protests."

However, the text was not displayed because FIU claimed there were historical inaccuracies.

According to Ruth Hamilton, GC's executive director, the real controversy arose when several students' artworks weren't chosen to be displayed in the Frost Art Museum. As a result, students protested and demanded the area intended to be a student lounge be used for an art gallery.

"The space was always intended to be a student lounge," Hamilton said. "It isn't designed to hold any large sculptures."

Today, the GC Gallery is a compromise between the two goals.

There's a piano, artwork and several comfy couches to accommodate students. 

"It's a nice place to hang out," said sophomore Christopher Pardo. "It's really quiet and a lot of people I know hang out here as well."

On Oct. 31, roughly 15 people attended the exhibit's closing reception. 

"The last time we had one of these events there were over 50 students present," said gallery coordinator Anais Campan.

Campan blames the low turnout on the day the event was held: Halloween.

As a result, plates full of brownies, meatballs and chocolate covered strawberries were left over. 

The few students who did pass through the reception grabbed some free food and drink and left. 

"I have mixed feelings about the gallery," Galano said. "Its integrity has been lessened and it isn't even advertised as a gallery any more. But it's still here ten years later."

While Galano has mixed feelings about the gallery's current role on campus, Wedderspoon believes it's an asset to FIU.

"I think there are too many couches," Wedderspoon said. "But I couldn't imagine a better situation. It's not a great space for larger sculptures like mine, but I'd hate for students not to have it."

Headline: Alumnus premiers documentary
Author: Maria Chercoles / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
The Cuban Research Institute will present the premier of FIU alumnus Lisandro PÃ©rez-Rey's new documentary, Those I Left Behind. The documentary, which centers on the seperation Cuban families endured for nearly half a century, will be shown Nov. 9 at the Graham Center West Ballroom.

"The story is about families in the United States and their loved ones left behind in Cuba. It centers on the family division. Cubans can't leave because of Cuban traveling restrictions, and now Americans can't go to visit because the United States has adopted restrictions too," PÃ©rez-Rey said.

The director refers to the United States decision in  March 2004 of regulating travel to Cuba and limiting it only to visits of relatives who are direct family members such as parens or grandparents. 

PÃ©rez-Rey was born in Miami from Cuban parents and graduated from FIU in 1997 with a degree in anthropology and sociology, but accomplished a career in documentary making. His first two documentaries have screened at numerous international festivals from Los Angeles to Prague. 

"I have always been interested in Cuban issues. In Those I Left Behind, I wanted to explore the concept of transnationalism, a person who is from one country but identifies as being from another place," PÃ©rez-Rey said.

The CRI has followed and supported PÃ©rez-Rey since he graduated, even by helping to finance his first documentary, Beyond the Sea, about the Mariel boatlift of 1980 in which thousands of Cubans arrived to Miami in rafts. In his second documentary, The Cuban Hip Hop Factory, PÃ©rez-Rey followed rappers in Cuba for several months as they tried to succeed as musicians. The documentary was screened in Cuba in a film festival where it received good critics. However, PÃ©rez-Rey doesn't know whether Those I Left Behind will be screened there.

"I really hope it screens in Cuba. However, I have covered the subject very objectively. More than being a movie for Cubans, it is about creating awareness in this country. Not many Americans know that fellow citizens are restricted from traveling to Cuba," PÃ©rez-Rey said.

The documentary was filmed both in Cuba and the United States. For the one week shooting in Cuba, PÃ©rez-Rey traveled as a journalist and obtained all the required permits.

 "I remained above the board, I didn't lie about my intentions," PÃ©rez-Rey said.

The film consists of a series of interviews of four families who have been separated due to travel restrictions and who share their emotions from the two sides of the Florida Straits.

"I think Those I Left Behind is an excellent documentary because it focuses on current stories. Family separation has been going on for more than 40 years," said Uva De Aragon, CRI associate director. "PÃ©rez-Rey touches the issue just the right way, providing the perfect amount of information just to touch you without trying to manipulate your feelings."

PÃ©rez-Rey will not attend the screening, but on behalf of him, De Aragon will lead a discussion in which she hopes to address the issue of family separation and hear experiences from the audience. Some of the people interviewed in the documentary are expected to be at the premier and engage in the discussion as well.

"Both professors and students should see the film because it helps understand what their own families or those around them are going through," said De Aragon. "The documentary shows both sides of the issue." 

"The film is a bit critical. It's not effective for governments intervene in people's lives. However, more than a political film, it deals with emotions, an emotional transnationalism," PÃ©rez-Rey said. 

Those I Left Behind will screen Nov. 9 at 7:30 p.m. in the GC West Ballroom at University Park and is free and open to the public.

Headline: Forum introduces College of Medicine dean candidate
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Search and Screen Committee for the College of Medicine has been looking for the top candidates who could hold the position of dean of the new college. Dr. John Rock is the top pick despite the fact that the other two finalists for the position received more votes of support from the Search and Screen Committee.

"Rock was one of our top three candidates," said Divina Grossman, dean of the School of Nursing and chair of the College of Medicine's Dean Search and Screen Committee.

The committee, composed of 15 faculty members as well as several community doctors, chose three finalists from a pool of six candidates for the deanship position. The other two finalists are Dr. Pope Mosley and Dr. Michael Wilkes.

When votes were tallied up, Rock received eight votes while Mosley and Wilkes received 10 votes each. During the voting process each committee member could potentially vote three times; however, all of the committee members were not present during the voting process, according to Grossman.

During a public forum held Nov. 2, Rock answered various technical questions about his plans or strategies for the College of Medicine if he were to become its dean. There were roughly 100 faculty and staff members present during the forum.

"My main goal if made dean of the College of Medicine would be to put in place the various policies and procedures needed and to accept our first class," Rock said. "There are going to be a lot of challenges as we move forward."

According to Grossman, the reason Rock was the only candidate present at the public forum and ahead of the other two candidates who received more votes from the committee is because President Modesto A. Maidique and Interim Provost Ronald Berkman favored him.

"We still have some people to look at, but Rock could have a phenomenal impact on FIU," Maidique told The Beacon. 

Rock boasts an impressive resume, which plays into why he is the favored candidate for the position.

He was chairman and director of the Residency Training Program Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Emory University School of Medicine from 1992 to 2002, director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions from 1978 to 1991, and is currently the chancellor of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center at New Orleans since 2002.

Academically he has served as a professor at numerous universities including LSU, Emory University and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Rock is also the author of many scholarly journals. 

 "Rock has excellent credentials and has extensive experience in administration," Grossman said. 

 Based on the atmosphere of Rock's public forum, it seems that he will most likely be the first dean of the College of Medicine. 

"He has all the ingredients needed to bring a lot to FIU," said Eric Crumpler, an assistant professor of Biomedical Engineering. "I think he can move the college forward."

While nothing is set in stone, Rock is still enthusiastic over the prospect of becoming the recently approved college's first dean.

"We're going to be so great that [the medical students will] be beating down our doors to get in," Rock said. "We are going to create new generations of medical practitioners in this area."

Headline: SGC-UP unaware of Sunshine Law
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
A bill recently passed by the Student Government Council at University Park will allow the House of Representatives to discuss appropriations at impromptu meetings before the council's general meetings, a move which may possibly be in violation of  the Florida Government-in-the-Sunshine Law.

Under the Sunshine Law, every member of the public, and every student, has the right to attend any SGC-UP meeting. Since the new meetings will be called at the last minute, there won't be enough time to notify students or give them the opportunity to attend. 

According to Arthur Meyer, speaker pro-tempore of the house, who introduced the bill jointly with Speaker of the House Rocio Perez, there are times when the council needs to discuss a bill before the general council meeting.

In those cases, Meyer said, Perez calls a last-minute House meeting to prepare that bill for discussion before the entire council that same week. Holding last-minute House meetings might expedite the legislative process, but it also violates Florida Government-in-the-Sunshine open meetings laws. 

According to the First Amendment Foundation's guide to Sunshine Laws, section 286.011 of the Florida Statutes states, "Florida's Government-in-the-Sunshine Law applies when two or more members of the same elected or appointed public board or commission meet to discuss or take action on any matter [regarding public business]. The Sunshine Law requires that: meetings be open to the public; notice be given; and minutes be taken."

The purpose of the open meetings law is to allow the public to see, hear and become involved in its government's decision-making. In order to give the public a chance of attending a meeting, the government must provide "reasonable notice" of the meeting.

Although the law only says that reasonable notice must be given, the courts and the attorney general have further specificed that notice must be posted somewhere readily accessible and visible to the general public at least 24 hours before a meeting.

Charlie Andrews, director of Campus Life and Orientation and SGC-UP advisor, said he wasn't sure whether student government is legally bound by the  laws.

"We haven't had anyone from the state come down on us yet, but then I don't think that they're really concerned about what student government does, anyways. I'd be surprised if we show up on their radar screen," Andrews said. "I do think that the general spirit of the Sunshine Laws should apply to them, though."

Adam Goldstein, a lawyer at the College Press Law Center in Washington, D.C., disagrees.

"They're an elected body in a public institution, and they're funded by public money. Even if they're funded by student fees, those are still state funds. They definitely fall under the jurisdiction of the Sunshine Laws," Goldstein said.

Meyer was surprised to learn that the House's practice of holding last-minute meetings that are not publicly announced is not consistent with Sunshine Laws.

"That's definitely something I'm going to look into," he said. "Making our meetings as open as possible to the public is definitely something the House needs to do. We are, after all, the ones voted in by our constituents."

SGC-UP President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon blames this and other conflicts the council has had with Florida's sunshine laws on lack of education.

According to Leon, he is aware that SGC-UP members are not properly trained in open government laws.

"I've been involved with student government for most of my time at FIU, and I'm a senior now, and I've only heard of it from when I attend meetings with the board of trustees and the Florida Student Government Association Board," he said.

Leon said he plans on working in conjunction with Kathryn Cubbon, SGC-UP judicial chair, to create a program to educate student government memebers on sunshine laws.

So far, he is planning to arrange a workshop led by an attorney from the Office of the General Counsel.

Leon acknowledged that fully implementing sunshine laws might be difficult for SGC-UP.

"Our student government is very active, and implementing Sunshine Laws might be a little hard. One of the hardest things I see is giving students notice of when meetings will be held. But now that we know it's a problem, we should clean it up," he said.

Headline: Flame Broiled Bucks: Aramark increases campus food prices
Author: Yesenia Forte / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
At the Fresh Food Company - the buffet style cafeteria at University Park - the price for lunch and dinner in 2005 was $6.94 with tax included. This year, the price has gone up to $8.01.

Junior Kristin Saxton compared the pricing of food services on campus to the venues in airports.

"It's a confined market," Saxton said. "They know we are going to eat here so all they're doing is pumping the market that they know they have."

Rosanna Martinez is a member of the National Student Exchange and a senior living in the UP Apartments. She doesn't like to cook so she eats at the FFC a lot.

"Sometimes it's not worth it. Sometimes they only have red meat options and I don't eat red meat," Martinez said. "They should not have increased the price so much."

Felecia Townsend, the director of business services, attributed the price boost to the increase in cost of living.

"Everything goes up: food, gas [and] tuition. The prices drastically changed I would say because of the window between the old contract and the new one,"  Townsend said.

In the old contract, the University set the prices. Toward the end of the '05-'06 school year the contract was out to bid. The foodservices company Aramark Corporation set the prices for the new contract and business services had to negotiate.

"The price we had was way below market," said Townsend. "When we saw where we were versus other universities, we were much lower."

Jeff Nadlman, resident district manager for Aramark, agreed.

"I firmly believe that our pricing at the Fresh Food Company is very reasonable for an all you can eat environment with the variety that it offers," said Nadlman in an e-mail.

Students who live in Panther Hall and the new Lakeview Hall don't have kitchens in the rooms and are obligated to purchase the Flex 10 meal plan, which is included in their housing fee. 

"It's messed up that they force us to eat there and we aren't allowed to have a hot plate or anything in the room," said junior Andrew Robinson, a Lakeview resident.

With the Flex 10, those students are entitled to 10 meals at FFC per week and $500 in Panther Bucks which can be used in other dining locales around campus.

"I have no choice but to eat there, but I usually don't use all the meals," said Brenda Benitez, a sophomore living in Lakeview.

Including the meal plan in the housing contract was a University decision, not Aramark's.

"Students should be able to use the meal plan for other food options," said Peer Advisor Jennifer Jacques.

Those other food options aren't necessarily cheaper. The prices of campus food services such as Burger King are slightly higher than at neighboring venues.

A Whopper Jr. sells for $1.29 at the on-campus BK, while the BK on west 49th Street in Hialeah, and the one across UP on 107th Ave., sell the same burger for $1. Across the street, a Double Whopper sells for $2.79 and on campus it's $3.51.

Aramark is responsible for researching prices in the area and coming up with a reasonable proposal. Business services then does spot checks of the locations listed and decides whether or not to approve the proposal.

When Aramark turned in their proposal for the prices at Burger King, they had to research and list the prices of two other Burger King locations and list their proposed price.

"Our personal studies have told us that Burger King prices in the Miami-Dade and Broward county area vary even within their individual locations as well," Nadlman said.

The prices Aramark proposed to business services are in most cases above average.

"We don't always go with the lowest bidder," Townsend said. "There are other things that are important."

According to Townsend, seven out of the 10 state universities use Aramark.

"They have a lot of resources and give scholarships," she said. "They are a leader."

During contract negotiations, the addition of a new cafeteria closer to the housing buildings was also discussed.

"We do see there will probably be more housing units coming on board," said Townsend. "We want a sense of community. The cafeteria should be closer to housing because housing students are the target."

The exact location of the new cafeteria has not been determined, but Townsend said Aramark has conducted a study on how far people are willing to walk to get food. The contract states that construction on the new cafeteria will begin in 2009, but business services is trying to speed things up.

New food options may also be in the works. Towsend said that the addition of a new food vendor at the Alvah H. Chapman Graduate school of Business, which is currently under construction, may be a possibility. However, she didn't disclose any further information.

The Java City in the library will be replaced with a Starbucks and they are looking for a new concept to replace Gracie's Grill - Townsend said Chili's is being considered. Toward the end of November, CafÃ© Bustelo will be in GC next to Burger King.

"We wanted to bring in local flare," Townsend said.

Headline: PlayStation 3 VS. Nintendo Wii: Anticipation for new gaming consoles grows
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The wait for the next generation of video game systems from Nintendo and Sony is almost over: the Sony PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii are scheduled to appear in stores on Nov. 17 and Nov. 19, respectively. 

Unlike previous game consoles such as the PlayStation 1 and the Nintendo 64, the Wii and PS3 are radically different. These differences have been broken down into the following key areas: 



~ Price ~
The most obvious difference between the two systems is the price. The Wii will be sold for $250 and the PS3 will carry a price tag of either $500 or $600, depending on whether you buy the 20 gigabyte or 60 gigabyte hard drive version.  

The cost of the systems is a strong factor that will determine which system will be bought by students such as junior Daniel Bassols. 

"The PlayStation's price is really high," Bassols  said. "I think it's well priced because of the Blue Ray [disc format], but I'm a hardcore classic gamer, so I'll buy the Wii for sure." 

Sony is really pushing the button when it comes to the price of a game system - when the PS3 launches, it will hold the record as one of the most expensive gaming consoles ever at launch date. So for the students on a budget, the Wii is the economical choice and winner of this category. 



~ Controller ~
The Wii's trademark feature is its new type of controller. The controller, unlike any other, is shaped like the standard TV remote control. It's divided into two parts: the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk. The various games Nintendo has planned for the Wii will make use of this new type of controller.  

The Nunchuk is connected to the Wii controller and its main function will be movement, while the Wii controller will be used for specific actions such as opening a door or reading something. Nintendo's goal is to have a highly interactive (if not tiring) gaming experience. 

The PS3 will have the same controller design it's always had. 

Despite reservations about the Wii Controller, it definitely wins this category for sheer originality alone. 



~ Hardware ~
When it comes to hardware between various generation consoles the differences are minimal. However, this time around there is a lot to be said about the Wii and the PS3.

For starters, the PS3 is loaded with technology the Wii does not touch. Blue Ray technology is  probably the most eye catching. Blue Ray is being considered the next phase of data storage, much the same way DVDs were over CDs. And regardless of which version of the PS3 you will be buying, Blue Ray is included.

The main difference between the two versions is that the $600 model will include memory stick/SD/compact flash slots, Wi-Fi connectivity, and a 60 GB hard disk drive while the $500 model will only come with a 20 GB hard drive. Consumers can upgrade the cheaper system.

Simply put, the PS3 has a lot more technology wrapped up in it. Blue Ray DVD players sell for as much as $1000, so the PS3 does have a lot of perks it in. While both systems can connect to the internet and are backwards compatible with older games, the Wii just falls short in this category. At face value the PS3 is the stronger system and winner of this category.  



~ Games ~
Both the Wii and PS3 will boast an online feature which will allow players to download new content and play with other players online. The Wii is taking special note of this feature, called virtual console, and will have over 30 classic titles available for download (for a fee) at launch date. It also looks like the Wii will have more games available at launch as well. So again, the Wii takes another category.

So the scores are the Nintendo Wii with three points, and the Sony PS3 with one point. By a not-so-minor margin, the Wii is the better of the two new consoles. However, only time will tell what actual consumers will clamor for this holiday season.

Headline: Students compete to write 50k word novel during November
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Among FIU's numerous distinctions, the University is also the training ground for a new generation of fiction writers, such as short story author Victoria Simon.

"I write short stories [so far] because they are such wondrous little packages of truth - both for the reader and for the writer," Simon said. 

"The amazing thing about writing is that it's a process of discovery." 

Simon is enrolled at FIU as a non-degree seeking student, taking undergraduate courses in fiction writing.

"I started knowing nothing about fiction," said Simon.  

"What I've learned is that it requires enormous patience. My stories do not emerge on the first draft, or the second, or the third. But as you write, you learn things about yourself that you didn't know, couldn't know when you started."

For the past few years, November has been designated as National Novel Writing Month, also known as NaNoWriMo, a creative writing project dedicated to encouraging novel writing.  

As stated on the NaNoWriMo website: "NaNoWriMo is a novel-writing program for everyone who has thought fleetingly about writing a novel but has been scared away by the time and effort involved."

Since 1999, NaNoWriMo has been accepting contributions from aspiring writers worldwide. Participants have from Nov. 1 to Nov. 30, midnight local time, to complete and submit their contributions.

The NaNoWriMo website shows that over 59,000 aspiring writers participated in 2005.

Within this time frame, they must write a complete 175-page novel, 50,000 words minimum, or at least a portion of a novel that meets those page and word requirements.  

At the Biscayne Bay Campus Library, several students and professors kicked off NaNoWriMo Oct. 23 with a novel writing cram session.

Anyone who was willing to participate brought along their lap tops or rented one from the library and began writing their novels. 

After a few hours, participants took a few minutes to critique and edit each other's work. 

The next session will be Nov. 6 and there will be a session every Monday after that until Dec. 4.

"It's my job to organize write-ins for local participants while writing a 50k word novel myself," said Elena Klevsky, majoring in accounting and finance. She is also the 2006 Miami municipal liaison for NaNoWriMo.  

"I participated in NaNoWriMo last year and won; winning means reaching 50,000 words." 

NaNoWriMo is non-competitive, and there are no prizes for winners. 

As NaNoWriMo's website proclaims, the emphasis is on quantity, rather than the quality of one's writing.      

FIU is also doing its part to encourage a new generation of novelists and fiction writers, from the creative writing department's base of operations at BBC.

"There is a lot of craft to be learned about writing," said Les Standiford, a professor of English and director of the Creative Writing Program.  

"It's a lot like teaching people how to play piano - explaining what mistakes to avoid and coming to understand what it is you do well and should do more of."

In addition to his academic duties, Standiford is a novelist himself, having authored such works as Spill, Black Mountain and the Deal series.

Graduate students aiming for a master's degree in creative writing must complete a book-length work in their specified genre of interest. 

While this can include novels, works such as collections of short stories and poetry are also permitted.

Creativity is seen as being subjective, which may pose a challenge to some students of the arts.

"Creativity is very hard to grade," said junior Sabrina Saint Jour. 

"I do not think that a grade can be assigned to someone's personal style and technique. A grade can be assigned, however, to how well the work follows the restrictions of the assignment."  

According to Sandiford, grading varies from instructor to instructor.  

"For my part, doing enthusiastically what is required can get you a good grade. After that, I distinguish between what is good and what is excellent based on my years of experience as a writer and as a teacher, and by comparing students' work in a given class to that of their peers."

FIU has produced numerous alumni who have become novelists, including acclaimed Mystic River author Dennis Lehane.

The Student Government Council special elections were held Oct. 24 and 25. 

When the results were announced, sophomore Stephanie Jacques was overjoyed to find out she was able to retain her position as Biscayne Bay Campus lower division representative.

"I was really happy to be back on the council because I wanted to continue what I started," Jacques said.

Sophomore Nellista Reid also won the position of BBC Lower Division Representative. She said she was looking forward to becoming more active in the BBC community. 

"I wanted to do something here on campus by getting involved," Reid said.

Reid and Jacques corresponded with The Beacon via e-mail to talk about what is expected of them.

Q: Why did you apply for the position of BBC lower division representative?



N: I applied for the position for lower division Representative at Biscayne Bay [Campus] because in high school I was the type of student that was involved in clubs where I held the position of president and vice-president.



S: I applied for the position of lower division representative because I know that the lower division student body has concerns that need to be addressed and are not able to direct those concerns to the appropriate personnel. I really enjoy speaking with, and for, students and I consider it an honor to represent them.



Q: What is your job description?



N: Being the lower division representative, I am the liaison between the students and the administration here at FIU; I represent the concerns of my fellow undergraduate students. Â 



S: As a lower division representative, I mainly advocate on behalf of the lower division body. I conduct surveys so that I may be knowledgeable of what is [in] their best interest in decisions throughout the University.



Q: What have you implemented and do you hope to implement during your tenure?



N: So far during my tenure I have not been able to implement anything that regards my goals, but I have been in the developing stages of the self-defense classes I want to be held on campus to provide students with the how to's in any dangerous situation.



S: So far, I have completed surveys whose results I plan to bring forth to the corresponding people. I have also scheduled some presentations in SLS courses so that the students are familiar with [SGA] and we may communicate better. I have also begun to work with the Wellness Center to know how the center could better serve BBC students.



Q: How do you hope to make a difference with your position as BBC lower division representative?



N: I hope to make a difference with my position by getting the undergraduate students more involved and aware of the things happening on campus that can and will impact them later.



S: I will put my maximum effort and all persistence necessary to fulfill the needs of the lower division body because I truly care. I will use my resources wisely to accomplish tangible goals that will be useful to BBC students.

Headline: Students fed up by speed limit
Author: Ana Davis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Junior Kyle Bailey hates the school zone students must drive through when entering the Biscayne Bay Campus.

According to Bailey, it's an inconvenience to drive 25 miles per hour, 24 hours a day on that road. 

"If I drive through there at 2 a.m. I still have to go 15 mph? Who hangs around a school at 2 a.m.? There's no safety concern but I can't afford a d--n ticket," Bailey said.  

BBC students in general are confused with the new traffic regulations that have been put in effect during the first days of the opening of the David Lawrence Jr. K-8 Center last August. 

The speed limit of 15 mph is in effect 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and tickets are being issued.

The 15 mph speed limit, implemented during the first days of the school year, is enforced from the flashing electronic directional sign and it ends at the end of the school zone sign. In all other areas of 151st Street, the speed limit remains 30 mph. 

In the future, the school zone will be marked as every other school zone in Miami-Dade County. There will be flashing lights, crosswalk markings and posted school zone hours. 

Vice Provost Damian Fernandez recently sent a memorandum to all FIU students, faculty and staff stating that the speed limit is in effect and all violators will be prosecuted. 

"We are expecting that clear signals will be posted. We have contacted all the authorities but the process is taking longer than it should. At some point, it will be a normal school zone," Fernandez said.  

Junior Kristina Gutierrez has also voiced her concern. 

"I obey the speed limit, but people speed by me. I've heard of students and faculty getting very expensive tickets," Gutierrez said.

Public Safety Captain Michael Wright says that FIU has issued a work order to Miami-Dade County to get the proper signs in place.

"We received some signs for the school zone hours, but they were wrong and we had to send them back," he said. 

As of Oct. 19, the work order was placed as an urgent matter for Team-Metro to take care of. 

Currently, the work order has been forwarded to Miami-Dade Public Works, but its status is pending. 

As of press time, there is no date estimated for the matter to be resolved. 

According to Captain Wright and Fernandez, the matter is entirely in the hands of Team-Metro. 

"We are concerned because it's an elementary school, but we understand the concern of FIU students. If this was up to FIU, it would have been done already," Wright said. 

He also confirmed that North Miami Beach police have issued tickets regarding speed violations.

FIU officers park a car with flashing lights every morning in front of the school to remind oncoming traffic about the speed limit.

This is done as a public service; however, FIU officers cannot issue traffic tickets, according to Wright. 

Other issues involve the poor placement of the signals.

"The signals should have been placed before school started," said Camilo Silva, president of the Student Government Council at BBC.

"SGA has received complaints from students, but little can be done by FIU. The speed limit is inconvenient. It's a half-mile from Biscayne Boulevard to FIU. It takes a long time driving at 15 mph," he said.

Fernandez added that caution and restraint are the most important things at this moment. 

"This office has been trying to speed the process of signalization but it's just not in our power," Fernandez said.
