Headline: SGC reveals budget report updates, changes
Author: Lucy Orozco / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Government Councils at the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses changed how they handle their yearly budget reports.

An evaluation was being made on the budget process and whether or not funds were being dispersed productively, Cassandra S. Andrade, SGC-BBC Vice President, said.

"It is our duty to ensure that the money we allocate is utilized properly," Andrade said. "Both Sergio Ibarra Bolanos and Jonathan Doozan, the SGA comptrollers, have been very instrumental in overseeing this year's expenditures. Furthermore, Student Government is looking into ways to evaluate this year's allocations, so that we can better prepare for budget time."

Andrade said that SGA has devised a new and more detailed event audit report. With the previous form, organizations were limited in their responses. They were only required to check off boxes stating whether or not funding was adequate. 

The new form asks questions as to the purpose of specific organizations events, whether or not the purpose was accomplished, what was positive and negative about the events and whether they feel the events should be done next year.

SGA has also developed a new mandatory form called the Conference Closure Report, in which organizations are required to answer questions detailing an overview of the conference, and how it is beneficial to students.

Jonathan Doozan, SGC-BBC's comptroller, has researched how other state and national universities budget their money to improve student services.

University students currently pay an activities and services fee of $10.52 per credit hour. 

This money is given to both University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus' SGC to disburse accordingly.

"Most students don't know that they are being taxed, and therefore don't know what their money is being used for," Doozan said. "This means that the way the money has been disbursed might not be adhering to actual student concerns."

SGC's A&S revenue for the 2007-2008 school year is $10,047,841 according to the Student Government Association's Budget Report. 

SGC promotes student involvement in the budgeting process; all of the University-wide Budget Committee meetings are open to the public.

"Students should definitely be more involved in the budgeting process," said Katiana Saintable, SGC-BBC president. "We should let our voices be heard in votes and when SGA has our forums, town hall meetings and even our general meetings, it is important to attend and participate."

Andrade also stressed the importance of student attendance at upcoming budgeting meetings to be aware of where their money is going. 

"Students have the right to know where the funds are going," Andrade said. "I encourage students to utilize the services and participate in the various organizations and events that we fund, such as: Career Services, Center for Leadership, Volunteer Action Center, and the Women's Center. I also encourage students to give us their feedback."

The next SGC finance committee meetings will be held on Oct. 16 and 30. All of the information discussed at these upcoming meetings will be available at the Wolfe University Center Web site, wuc.fiu.edu. 

For more information, students are encouraged to stop by the BBC Campus Life office in WUC 141.

Headline: Student artists take steps to revive art-enthusiast club
Author: Lauren Agosto / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's back to business for the Fine Arts Students Association. After a two-year hiatus, FASA, an artistic organization that gives students the opportunity to grow as artists by learning from each other's work and experience, has come back as an active organization on campus. 

Previously active members graduating and moving on to other projects, the group became inactive in 2005. Then in 2006, Christopher Rodriguez became president of the club and has worked hard since then to get the club back up and running along with the help of other club officers: Patricia Suau, Samuel Gualtieri, Izlia Fernandez, Cristina Molina, Arlen Ruiz, Kacey Westall, and Santiago Castillo.

"We expose students to the Miami gallery system.  This means proposal submissions, show installations, networking skills, understanding call to artists, and implementation." Mariela Rossel, who handles public relations for the organization, said.

According to Rodriguez, the group first began when the University first opened. At the time, they did not have a title; it was simply a small group of artists with a common interest who would meet together to discuss their work and experiences.

In the Mid-90s, the group began to protest the lack of recognition of the arts, and worked for the opportunity to have their voice heard, as well as a gallery space to showcase their work. 

It was at this time that FASA was officially formed.

Rodriguez is looking to the club's future, and has set many goals for FASA. 

In particular are more club activities, more attention to the arts, empowerment of students through education, and building professional skills in students as they pursue a career in the arts.

"Today in Miami, it takes more than just cultivating your artistic voice, but also cultivating your business sense and becoming aware of how to professionally sustain yourself once you graduate from the Fine Arts program at FIU," Rossel said.

Vice president Patricia Suau also feels that this practical knowledge is important to address through the club's work.

"A few short run goals are to teach ourselves and each other the workings of an exhibition; not only how to hang paintings on the wall [straight] but how to talk about our work in an opening and how to sell our work.  We are setting up the skeleton to a machine that pumps out well educated artists, ready for "the real world" of the art business," Suau said.

FASA is open not only to art majors, but also to anyone who has an appreciation for the arts. 

Meetings are held the second and forth Thursday of every month at 8pm in the W1 Sculpture Studio in the back of the University by the baseball field and football stadium.

Headline: Mixed Martial Arts: Combat sport grows in popularity
Author: David Shaw  / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Many people wouldn't consider getting punched in the face an exciting weekend activity, but mixed martial artist competitor and student Travis Miller proves to be an exception.

"In high school, I wrestled and played football. I don't think any of those come close to Mixed Martial Arts," Miller said. He gets some hits in, too.

Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), a combat sport involving techniques such as submissions and grappling, allows any fighting style that is in the boundaries of the competition's rules, which might include boxing, judo and karate. The sport has gained tremendous popularity over the past years, and its impact has reached many students around campus.

Student Greg Cohen is a big MMA fan. Although he currently does not participate in martial arts, he's proud of one of the premier MMA fighting leagues, the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

"I love UFC. It's one of the only things I would watch on TV," he said.

The Ultimate Fighting Championship held its first event in 1993, drawing 86,592 television subscribers. In 1997, PRIDE fighting championships, another MMA group, started in Japan. 

Now, it's possible to watch matches from many different leagues on many different TV channels.

In 2006, the Ultimate Fighting Championship took the highest pay-per-view ratings overall, overshadowing boxing events and the World Wrestling Entertainment.

 "In an MMA fight, anything can happen. They can take it to the ground, they can stand or out of nowhere someone can get caught with a flying kick," Miller said. 

Miller has trained for more than five years at the Freestyle Fighting Academy, located across the street from University Park's east entrance. Its Web site, www.floridamartialarts.com, boasts itself as a world class gym and hosts fighters who are currently having successful careers in professional MMA circuits.

"When I got started in MMA, it was 2002 before the sport got big. Back then, you'd say you're in Mixed Martial Arts and people would be like, 'oh you're in the WWE or [some other wrestling league].' Now you say you're in MMA and people understand," Miller said.

MMA is not just an all-out fight, however.

"The thing with fighting is that no one wants to see an actual fight. It's brutal. MMA is more entertaining. It's more fun to watch, more commercial," said Edelberto Hernandez, a junior who has a background in wrestling.

The initial UFC had very few rules. According to www.grapplearts.com, the only rules were no eye-gouging, biting and fish-hooking. 

It was only just before the UFC was bought by Zuffa Inc., an American sports production company, that the sport has developed many of the rules and forms that are popular in today's MMA.

Some fans such as Miller, however, don't agree with certain competition regulations.

"I'm not exactly for all those rules. I can understand some rules: no fishhooks, no eye gouging, no punches to the groin. [But] in almost all matches, if you're standing, you can't strike a downed opponent with elbows or knees; you can't even punch them sometimes," Miller said.

Currently, MMA is in a state of flux. Different leagues exist, but some are being dissolved or united. Earlier this year, PRIDE was purchased by the UFC, which is owned by casino moguls Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta. 

The mergers and dissolutions, though, are not an issue for fans such as Miller, who follows the sport regardless and incorporates MMA into his training. 

"I hope to train as long as my body lets me," Miller said.

Headline: Indie musicians find home in local venues, MySpace
Author: Elyse Coleman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Underground music, once akin to a rite of passage for musicians looking to debut into the mainstream, has since become something of its own genre. Such music, which typically has a cult following instead of mass appeal, is not usually seen on MTV nor heard on radio stations, but instead on college radio programs and MySpace. 

Bands and groups are actually prideful of this obscurity, but this type of music isn't as obscure as one might think, especially in South Florida.

Miami has a large number of independent groups. MySpace Music has 491 bands registered in Miami-Dade that are labeled as "Indie," or independent from the mainstream. Included among them is Leading the Heroes (www.myspace.com/leadingtheheroes).

"They've been together 18 months," said senior Andrew Julian, a close friend of drummer Nick Day. "They have a really different sound. If I had to compare it to anything, I'd say it sounds like how alternative rock sounded in 1992."

Commercials are beginning to reach out more to artists unheard of by American audiences. One of the recent GEICO Cavemen commercials sampled the last 20 seconds of "Remind Me," a song by the Norwegian electronic music duo Röyksopp. 

Vonage commercials feature the song "Woo Hoo" by Japanese rock and roll trio The 5.6.7.8's, who were also featured on the soundtracks for Kill Bill and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift; the DVD for Kill Bill contains an extra where you can watch two of the three sets played by The 5.6.7.8's during filming. 

The rising awareness of underground music has even become apparent on television programming. 

Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim, is known for its "bumps," commercial bumpers featured in between shows made up of black cards with white text on them. 

The background music for these bumps includes a wide variety of independent music, particularly groups under the Stones Throw Records music label, an independent hip-hop label; a listing of the music featured in the Adult Swim bumps is located on Bump Worthy (www.bumpworthy.com).

Outside of everyday media, students such as senior Daniel Molluzzo are finding out about underground music via local live performances.

"I had first seen The Blue Van perform at Studio A, but I later read a Fricke's Picks column on them in Rolling Stone," said Molluzzo.

Studio A, located on 60 NE 11th Street, spots itself as "Miami's premier live music Venue and nightclub." 

Fricke's Picks, maintained by Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke, can be found online at www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/category/frickes-picks/.

As for The Blue Van, Molluzzo went on to describe them as R&B meets 60s rock with a sound slightly reminiscent of The Who.

Although clubs and bars are usual hangouts for live acts, other students are finding little-known music in rather unexpected places.

"I first heard Rhapsody [of Fire] while watching a pet twirling competition," said senior Christopher Khaward. "The only way I could describe it was Judas Priest meets Iron Maiden.

More information on the band, which changed its name from Rhapsody to Rhapsody of Fire in July 2006 due to trademark issues, can be found at www.rhapsodyoffire.com.

Underground music isn't free of controversy, however. 

There has been a growing concern about the pride that has surrounded underground music as of late. 

To some fans such as junior Peter Castillo, it appears that now more bands are attempting to benefit from the increased awareness of independent music, contradicting the whole meaning of being "under the radar." 

"Underground music in itself used to be all about being different from the mainstream," said Castillo. "But it's now come to be its own genre, and I don't think that's where it should be. Now we have "indie rock" and people are now striving to imitate a lot of underground acts."

Headline: Seinfeld creates buzz with interview
Author: Shannon Fallon / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A frizzy-haired Jerry Seinfeld stepped onto the red carpet of the Lincoln Road Regal Cinemas in Miami Beach sporting a casual, wrinkled white button down tucked neatly into pair of dark denim jeans. 

With 50 Cent blasting through the stereo and a cluster of journalists waiting, the former sitcom star joked about how beautiful Miami's weather had been and introduced clips from his new animated film, the Bee Movie, which will be released on Nov. 2.  

He also sat down with reporters from college newspapers, including The Beacon, for a roundtable interview.

Seinfeld voices Barry B. Benson, a bee who decides to venture outside the hive and explore the outside world. 

On a special trip outside the hive, Barry's life is saved by a human named Vanessa, played by Renee Zellweger. As Vanessa and Barry. B's friendship blossoms, B. discovers that humans are stealing honey from the hard working bees and mass-producing  it. 

Subsequently, he decides to sue humans for their crime. 



Q: Why make a movie about bees? 

A: Bees live a very structured kind of corporate environment. 

In fact, it's like a little company hanging from a tree. They all have their offices and bosses and employees, with their duties and schedules. It's so regimented. 

They're so fat with tiny little wings and produce honey - this product that lasts forever. I just thought 'what a great setting for a story.'



Q: You're an acclaimed stand-up comedian and sitcom star, but what made you transition over to animation? 

A: It was really the film itself. Visually, it is so stunning to me and so interesting. 

If I could take those images and put a different kind of comedy into it, I thought it would be a great combination. 

I didn't know for sure, but I thought it'd be fun to try and I really wanted to do something different.

If I were going to get involved in a big project, it would have be something new and different so it would be exciting. 



Q: How did you modify your comedy to appeal toward a more family-oriented audience?

A: I didn't. I feel if it's done right, it cuts across age lines, culture lines and ethnic lines; I just find that it works. With "Seinfeld," we wrote whatever we thought was funny, and I had senior citizens, kids and Brazilians approach me about the show. 

We didn't write it for them, but they still loved it. You got to love what you do and whoever likes it, likes it. 



Q: You have an outstanding cast lined up for the movie. How was it collaborating with an assortment of comedians?

A: It was okay (laughs). These were people I always wanted to work with and whose talent I just really have tremendous respect for. 

It was very exciting to have someone like Renee Zellweger and tell her that I wanted something done like this and that, to then have her do it. It's unbelievable, it's fantastic. 



Q: What projects do have lined up next?

A: I don't know. I don't see any, but I never plan anything and I didn't plan this. I just kind wait for things to hit me. 

I have young kids, and I'm 53. I'm looking forward to spending more time at home - I mean, this was a big undertaking. 

To other people, it might just be another one of those cartoon movies, but for me and for [director] Steve Hickner and for others who worked on it, it stops your life. 

I'm looking for a little more normal life. I'm not looking for anything new.

Headline: A model of health...a wellness column: Britney Spears needs to go back to rehab
Author: Sandra Mateu / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
To be truly honest, I like Britney Spears. She may not be one of my favorite singers now that I am 23, but she definitely was in my top three when I was a teenager. She was cool, hot and I liked her music - she was one of my idols.

There is something about our idols that make them very special in our lives. Aside from enjoying the music, we sometimes end up caring for the person as a long time friend. 

This happened to me with Britney Spears. I listen, see and read horrible things about her every day and I feel that it sucks and is a sad truth.

Underneath all the wild events that have appeared in the tabloids, there is a woman in a critical health condition; of all her problems, the one that is most important is her health. I believe that if she was healthy, then she could get her life back together.

Many different sources have accused her of alcohol and drug abuse. The judge that took away the temporary custody of her two toddlers declared her a habitual user of drugs and alcohol and ordered regular testing, according to a New York Times article titled "Britney's Loss, Their Gain." Britney has failed at rehab three times already. Losing the custody of her kids and shaving her head for no reason are not signs of a mentally stable individual - the heavy partying and consumption of addicting substances doesn't help her deteriorating health.

But even though her level of performance has gone down enormously, there is some hope. The singer has had the number one single download on iTunes for "Gimme More," which sold more than 179,000 copies in its first week on sale on digital services. For me, such success was earned for the wrong reasons - the obscure desire that drives people to watch and listen to Britney embarrass herself. 

Like other famous celebrities, Britney is suffering the effects of growing up in the media spotlight.

All these actions are a product of being introduced to the media world at such an early age and not having support and guidance throughout all these years; important health factors such as emotional support and social support seem to be missing from her life.

Britney was a young girl that sold herself sexually through very sexy and tight clothing, producing highly seductive and sensual videos and kissing Madonna publicly.

What Britney needs now is support. This support can only come from the people that love her: family, friends and fans. Even though the media has taken a destructive tone, many artists and singers have already expressed their support, such as Tatum O'Neal, Kanye West and pianist and singer Tori Amos, according to the New York Times piece. 

I think that Britney should attempt rehab again and try to end her addiction problems, which are truly detrimental to her current state. Like an old friend of hers, I wish her the best, and like an old fan, I hope that through the support she is getting, she recuperates her career.

Headline: Honor society offers opportunities for psychology students to excel in major
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
For those pursuing a degree in psychology, joining FIU's chapter of Psi Chi, the national honor society in psychology, is one way to network with others and improve leadership skills.

"It is really a great opportunity for psychology majors or minors to enhance their college experience," said Vanessa Montero, vice president of Psi Chi. "Not only will they be provided with great tools to become more competitive graduate school applicants, but they will also have the opportunity to network with other students."	

The national society was founded in 1929 for the purposes of encouraging, stimulating and maintaining excellence in scholarship, and advancing the science of psychology, according to the Psi Chi web site; FIU's chapter has been in operation since June 1975. 

According to the main branch, Psi Chi serves two major goals: to provide students academic recognition and to nurture that recognition by offering services and programs to its members that foster development. 

"Being a member of Psi Chi has really assisted me in how to be a better candidate for graduate school," said senior Ninamarie Maspons. 

Post-undergraduate studies are so important to the society, that an entire portion of the Psi Chi web site is dedicated to providing tips and information on how to get into graduate programs. 

In order to join Psi Chi, a student must be pursuing a major or minor in psychology with at least nine credits, have attended three semesters at a college and have a cumulative GPA of 3.2 and in their psychology courses.  

"I initially [joined Psi Chi] because I thought it would look good on my graduate school application," said Stephanie Dominguez, community service chair. "However, by the time the first general meeting was over, I realized that this honors society was offering me much more than that."

For many members of Psi Chi, joining the organization has changed their lives.

"I've grown by leaps and bounds as a person and as a leader," said Kimberly Gray, president of Psi Chi. "I've discovered that I'm more tolerant, more tenacious and more steadfast than I could ever have imagined."

Meetings are held every other Monday at 12:30 p.m. in Graham Center room 150.

Gray commented that in addition to the monthly meeting, weekly events for members are planned. Attending these events gives Psi Chi members points that determine their level of participation in the society. 

Members must meet a minimum number of points to maintain their membership. 

  In October, four events are being planned: "Everything You Wanted to Know About Psychology" on Oct. 9, "Fun in the Sun!" Oct. 13, "GRE Practice Test" Oct. 20 and "His House Donation Drive" Oct. 29. 

The times and locations for the events are to be announced.

"[Psi Chi] offers unique opportunities to socialize with students and become involved with the community," Maspons said. 

Psi Chi members can also participate in the Greek Wide Academic Assistance Program every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the Learning Center located in Primera Casa room 247. 

The program offers Greeks and other honor societies help with schoolwork. 

For more information on FIU chapter of Psi Chi, visit their web site at www.fiu.edu/~psichi and for information on the national society, visit www.psichi.org. 

"Like everything in life, the Psi Chi experience is what you make of it," Gray said.

Headline: FIU competes for computer programming gold
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Getting a balloon for answering a question correctly may seem a bit childish in college, but for some FIU students, balloons are a big deal.

For the third year, FIU will be competing in a "battle of the brains"- the 32 annual Association for Computing Machinery International Collegiate Programming Contest, where balloons mean points toward bragging rights, scholarships and, for one talented team, a "world's smartest" trophy. 

Sponsored by IBM, ACM-ICPC is a worldwide competition for aspiring computer programming students. 

Even though competing in the ACM-ICPC is equivalent to completing a full semester of computer programming in just one afternoon, that hasn't stopped 6,099 universities from participating in this year's regional competition. 

The competition entails that teams of three students solve eight to 10 problems by writing computer programs during a five-hour period. 

Regional winners, 90 in total, then move on to the World Final, which will be held April 6-10, 2008 at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel in Alberta, Canada.

This year, two FIU teams will travel Oct. 13 to the Florida Institute of Technology to compete in the Southeast regional competition against the University of Miami, Florida State University, Florida Atlantic University and others. 

FIU took seventh and 17 place to schools like the University of Central Florida and Georgia Tech in the regional competition last year. 

"FIU is up and coming and we've done very well in the last three years," Kip Irvine, professor of computer science, FIU ACM chapter faculty advisor and a coach for this year's ACM-ICPC, said.

Knowing that the competition is fierce, FIU students have been practicing since May for three hours every Friday under coaches Irvine and Hien Nguyen, Miami-Dade community college professor in the department of computer information systems and student seeking his doctorate at FIU.

"The six guys that we have are very enthusiastic and talented," Nguyen said. "[We] train them to have a good mentality [and] train them against other students."

The practice sessions also focus on developing teamwork strategies, an important part of the challenge because three students have to work together at one computer during the competition, Irvine said.

For Sophomore Mario Consuegra, a member of FIU's team,  all that practice has paid off.

"We are friends and we like to work with each other," Consuegra said.

But for the FIU students and coaches competing this year, winning isn't the only goal of the competition.

According to Irvine, the ACM-ICPC is also important because it tests students on qualities that future employers look for. 

"It's not so much that I care about the prestige of winning, but I really care about preparing students for top jobs," Irvine said. "You see, that's one of the things that's really nice [about the competition], is a lot of students who do this get a lot of attention from the best employers in the country."

Regardless of the outcome at this year's regional competition, the FIU students and coaches feel the time will be well spent.

"I don't know about winning the competition, but I think were ready to do a good job," Consuegra said. "I think its going to be great for our careers and for the honor of the school if we do well in the competition."

Headline: DOWN WITH THE KING: Florida tomatoes tainted by harsh working conditions
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Before taking the next bite out of your Whopper from the Burger King in Graham Center, you should gain a little background of where that food is coming from.

No, I'm not talking about the treatment of the animals raised for the beef and chicken products. Burger King has already worked with PETA to improve the supply chain so that eggs and pork come from free-roaming animals only.

Unfortunately, the humans who are involved in BK's supply chain are not quite as lucky. 

Farm workers in the town of Immokalee, Florida are working for what the U.S. Department of Labor referred to in a report as "low wages, sub-poverty annual earnings, and significant periods of un- or underemployment."

In addition to the economic consequences of being a tomato-picker for the fast-food industry, the job also entails harsh working conditions and in some cases, exploitation in the form of withheld wages and forced labor.

The Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) has been fighting for fast-food companies to agree to higher wages for tomato-pickers and to agree to a code of ethics concerning the treatment of the workers.

To date, the CIW has reached agreements with McDonald's Corporation and Yum! Brands (parent company of Taco Bell). The latest campaign focuses its attention on Burger King, and centers around the company's refusal to pay more than about 45 cents for each 32 pound bucket of tomatoes.

This is practically the same rate that tomato pickers were paid in 1978 for each bucket of tomatoes, according to the CIW. 

Workers have not received any compensation for the increased cost of living in 30 years, and in order to make minimum wage, workers would hypothetically have to pick more than two tons of tomatoes on a daily basis.

Representatives of the CIW, who are also workers in the tomato fields of Immokalee, were recently invited as guest speakers to FIU and spent more than an hour speaking to Honors College students in English and Spanish, regarding the conditions they endure on a daily basis-except for days that they are not lucky enough to find any work.

Students were told that, even though the work week for Immokalee workers can total up to 70 hours, they do not receive overtime pay. Their pay is determined by chips given to them by overseers who collect the tomatoes into a truck for each bucket turned in.

They are also not paid for the time they spend in the morning waiting for the dew to melt off of the produce or when the overseer does not believe that the bucket of tomatoes is filled high enough.

Social activism has never been my forte-with the overwhelming number of global injustices making it impossible to live a completely guilt-free life. But as I sat in the audience, a mere few feet away from the local workers who are directly responsible for providing the food I buy right here on campus, I felt that this was an issue that I could, and should, help to expose.

The demands of the CIW are simple. They want one penny more per pound of tomatoes. This would nearly double the piece rate for the workers who make below the federal poverty line, and even farther below the estimated cost of living in Immokalee.

Secondly, a code of ethics should be established in order to prevent overseers from withholding wages from the workers or forcing them to work against their will.

Modern-day slavery does occur, and according to a CIW report, there have been five prosecutions of slavery operations right here in Florida which involved the mistreatment of over 1,000 workers since 1997.

Other restaurants have complied with the demands of field workers and are still making large profits. It's time for "The King" to do the same. BK's motto is "Have it Your Way" and 'my way' is food that has not been exploited from workers treated as sub-human.

The industry is not the only entity to blame for the treatment of workers. 

Even though the government has taken some action against the most severe cases of exploitation through prosecution, little information can be found regarding what, if anything, the government is doing to ensure that workers receive minimum wage and overtime pay. 

Despite this, however, corporations do have a responsibility, albeit an oft-ignored one, to conduct business in an ethical manner. The rapid growth of the fast food industry, and thus the highly increased demand for produce at low prices by these companies, directly contributes to the low wages.

BK needs to step up to the plate and sit down at the table with representatives of the farm workers who supply them. 

In terms of product, Burger King is my favorite fast-food restaurant and it will be a shame that they will be losing my patronage until business practices are reformed.

Headline: Texting while driving on its way to the end of the road
Author: Veronica Trueba / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
So, you're in the middle of the highway, driving at approximately 75 miles per hour, when all of a sudden you hear that familiar ringing tone. Yes, you've gotten a new message. Your cell phone is right beside you and all you have to do is reach for it with one hand, the same one you could use to reply. So, what do you do?

It is a fact that some individuals choose to text back. A survey by Nationwide Insurance confirmed that about 73 percent of drivers use cell phones, in addition to this, 20 percent text while driving. More specifically, according to a Zogby Poll 66 percent of people between ages 18 to 24 text while driving.

According to the article "Should driving while texting be a crime?" published in the Wall Street Journal, driving while texting is now considered the modern version of the so-called "distracted driving". 

In fact, a study conducted by the state of Washington revealed that texting was fifth in a list of distractions caused by "operating a handheld communications device".

The danger of this modern phenomenon has been proved. According to a story titled "Teen Rahal leads anti-text messaging campaign" in MSNBC, it is known that 80 percent of crashes and 65 percent of near crashes are caused by a particular distraction to the driver. 

Awareness does not seem to be the problem. According to a Harris Interactive Survey, commissioned by Pinger Inc, a messaging service, 91 percent of Americans think it's unsafe to text while driving. They even think it is as dangerous as driving after drinking and 89 percent of them think it should be outlawed. But 57 percent of them still admit they either do it or have done it.

For instance, freshman, Vanesa Vaquer was asked about the consequences of texting while driving. She replied, "It's extremely dangerous. Some people think they can handle it, but is texting really worth your life?"

Nevertheless, she claims that she does sometimes text while driving. She even reported how she was close to having an accident due to this once. "I was texting and I drove [into] the sidewalk by mistake".

There are plenty of other stories of teenagers texting while driving, which have had different endings. Another article published in MSNBC, "Texting while Driving? U R so busted!" reveals the story of 18 year-old Ashley D. Miller who in addition to not wearing a seat belt, was texting while driving in Arizona last month. This resulted in her Ford pickup switching lanes and smashing against a PT Cruiser. 

Even though, Ashley survived the 40-year-old driver of the PT Cruiser, Stacey A. Stubbs, died. Cases like these have driven many government officials to take drastic measures. In May 2007, the first law banning texting while driving was passed in Washington. This so called no-texting-while-driving law will go into effect January 1, 2008.

This law will result in a driver's $101 fine for texting while driving. But this is merely a secondary offense, which means that the driver has to be pulled over in order to be penalized. By now, the no-texting-while-driving law has been officially passed in Washington. But other states, like New York, California and Florida are considering its implementation. Also in Oregon, pending bills suggest fines of up to $720 for texting or holding a cell phone to the ear while driving. 

The implementation of anti-texting laws will make a tangible difference in preventing drivers from flagrantly endangering not only their own lives but the lives of others. It is a sad reality that a significant portion of the drivers traveling our streets will only practice caution when they are obligated to do so.

Headline: Commentary: MIDSEASON REPORT: Season's first half concludes with nation's longest losing streak
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For a team that failed to win a single game last year, high expectations were set forth for the 2007 FIU football team. 

The hiring of athletic director Pete Garcia and  head coach Mario Cristobal, along with a complete overhaul of the coaching staff and a new stadium looming overhead, culminated in more than a few unjust predictions for the season. 

Although the record, along with the scores in each game, speak for themselves, several important factors played into what has so far been a disaster of a season as we reach its midpoint.

First and foremost is the sheer difficulty of the schedule leading up to conference play. Not only are the University of Miami and Penn State two national stalwarts whose success has been well documented throughout the past decades, but Maryland is receiving national exposure with its upset of No. 10 Rutgers. Kansas, meanwhile, is 5-0 and took out a Top-25 team in Kansas State. 

While few expected a win during these first four matches, it is the two most recent games against Sun Belt Conference rivals Middle Tennessee and Troy that are reason for panic leading into the second half of the season.

The Golden Panthers were overwhelmed against the Blue Raiders Sept. 29, giving up 47 points in the first half alone. A glimmer of hope appeared against Troy, the defending conference champions, as the team put together its finest drive of the season in the first quarter and finished with its first rushing touchdown of the year. From there, unfortunately, the team reassumed its typical role, losing the game 34-16.

That being said, the team still has a chance at redemption, as every game here on out save for Arkansas presents what should be a competitive game for the Golden Panthers. 

Before they are picked to win any games, however, they will need to demonstrate cohesiveness on offense and an ability to score points, be it from turnovers, scoring drives or special teams. 

The team will also have to maintain its performance throughout the game and not in sporadic spots, which is an obvious quality of a bad team.

With that said, let's evaluate every position as we reach the midpoint of the season. 



Quarterback



Give head coach Cristobal credit for sticking to his guns and not benching redshirt freshman Wayne Younger despite extended periods of rough patches and the worst ranked offense in Division I-A football. 

While his decision-making at times has been questionable, his athleticism has kept many broken plays alive and even created opportunities that would not have been possible with the other quarterbacks. 

Younger is the right fit for the rest of the season as the offensive line is the team's biggest question mark and the other quarterbacks do not have the mobility needed to be successful with such insufficient protection.



Running Backs



While Julian Reams stood out during training camp, his success in practice has failed to translate to the games as he has yet to have any notable carries. Part of the problem stems from being hit in the backfield within moments of being handed the ball, and it is extremely difficult to be a play maker when there are not even small holes to run through. A'mod Ned has been almost heroic in his efforts to simply get back to the line of scrimmage most plays, and one can't help but wonder how good he could be given the opportunity to create plays. He is the most talented player on the offense and needs to touch the ball at least 20 to 25 times a game. 



Wide Receiver



While deep at the position, the lack of any real game breaker has plagued this squad from the start. Freshman John Ellingson has been a nice surprise, but an inability to get receivers open down field has resulted in opposing teams stacking the box and sending blitz packages that FIU is simply not good enough to respond to.



Offensive Line



An offensive line can make mediocre players look like All-Americans, but by the same token it can make talent look quite pedestrian. The line has been the main cause of deficiency for the offense, as it finds itself unable to find any rhythm due to the manhandling it is receiving from defensive lines. Should this problem be fixed, the team will find itself in a lot more games and be in the best position to take home a victory this season.



Defensive Line



While serviceable, the line has met expectations but not exceeded them. Against superior athletes, such as MTSU's Dwight Dasher, containment has been continually lost and big runs have been broken as a result. While certainly not the biggest issue, it will need to play smarter and find a way to slow down far superior athletes.



Linebackers



Missed tackles have been the largest problem for this squad, although Scott Bryant, Michael Dominguez, and Ryan Martinez have ably handled what was supposed to be the position on defense with the biggest question mark. Like the rest of the defense, they will need to avoid giving up the big play that has been one of the downfalls of the team this season.



Secondary



The biggest concern on the defense and possibly on the entire team because of poor tackling, poor coverage and poor play overall, which has resulted in opposing quarterbacks routinely passing for over 200 yards a game and throwing long touchdown passes. What was supposed to be the strong point of the defense has been the worst, and it will need to correct itself quickly in order for this team to have any chance at winning.



Special Teams



Special teams has been a double edged sword for the Golden Panthers, as punter Chris Cook is one of the best in the nation and demonstrating professional potential. He is the reason the scores are not more outlandish than they already are. Meanwhile, muffed punts and short returns have been a constant for this squad, as starter Lionell Singleton was benched after fumbling three punts in the opening game against Penn State. While Ellingson has been serviceable return man, there is no potential touchdown threat that opposing teams need to worry about, which greatly hinders the chance for any sort of big return.

Headline: Offensive woes continue for Golden Panthers in loss
Author: Luca Messina / Staff writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers (0-8-2, 0-2-0 Conference USA) lost a match marred by an insufficient offensive attack and an unusual shaky defensive performance to South Carolina (8-3-0, 2-0-0 C-USA) Oct. 7 at University Park. FIU started off very determined to score but was unable to keep up after an early goal by its conference foe, ultimately losing 3-1.  

"I think we played well up until that first goal at the 36 [minute mark]," said coach Munga Eketibi. "As soon as that ball went in it was like d&eacute;jà vu all over again. We have to score goals. It's already half way through the season and we have scored less than 10 goals. Scoring is the best remedy you can have." 

South Carolina, who is ranked No. 25 in the nation, couldn't get going early on but took advantage of FIU's plethora of mistakes in the second half. Those mistakes were what Eketibi called "self-inflicted wounds" as the defense wasn't as strong as usual. 

USC made it 1-0 in the 36th minute as sophomore Jeff Scanella netted his fourth goal of the year with a crisp shot that sailed past FIU goalie Kyle Thomas. The goal put a damper on FIU's energetic attack heading into halftime. 

The second half was marked by mistakes on both sides early but neither team was able capitalize in certain situations. 

After a goal by freshman Blake Brettschneider that put USC up 2-0, FIU had a number of defensive lapses that easily could have put the game out of reach. 

One of those mistakes was when an FIU defender threw his body in front of the goal to prevent a score because Thomas was on the ground after blocking a previous shot and leaving the net wide open with several USC players swarming.  

After failing to score numerous times, the Gamecocks would score again in the 67th minute to put the game out of reach at 3-0. 

Junior Brendan Williams netted the goal after he received a pass from senior J.D. Moon. 

FIU would finally get on the board in the 80th minute as junior Cory Kendall scored off a feed from Juan Guerra. 

He raced past several defenders to set up Kendall's shot perfectly. Although too late, the goal served as the one positive in a mistake-filled game.

Thomas would finish with a season-high eight saves, but also allowed a season-high three goals.

USC's freshman goalkeeper Jimmy Maurer would finish with four saves. 

The Golden Panthers have only scored five times in 10 games this season. 

Their offense has been the weakness, but the defense has been pretty solid, except for a few lackluster performances, such as this game. 

With eight games left, the teams looks to salvage what is already a disappointing season. Their next shot at a win will come Oct. 10 at University Park against the University of Central Florida.

&nbsp;
Looking for their first win in four tries in the Sun Belt Conference this season, the Golden Panthers Women's Soccer took on the Pioneers of Denver University on October 7 at University Park.

In what would prove to be a defensive struggle, the Golden Panthers continued their sloppy play, and shot themselves in the foot early when senior defender Kristin Hurst put the ball into the FIU goal for and own goal during the 14th minute. 

This score was all the Pioneers would need, as the Golden Panther offense failed to muster up much of an attack. 

The team managed just 2 shots on goal during the entire match, from sophomore midfielder Marina Pappas and junior midfielder Amy Jackson. 

Both shots on goal came during the same span of time, as Pappas launched a free kick that bounced off the crossbar during the 74th minute. Jackson controlled the rebound and fired a shot that was turned away by the DU goalkeeper.

Senior goalkeeper Madeline Gannon had a strong game, saving 5 shots before allowing 2 goals in the final 3 minutes to sink the Golden Panthers for good. 

Pappas missed another scoring opportunity in the 27th when she had a wide open net and the opportunity to tie the game up, but missed the wide right. 

The loss dropped the team to 2-6-1 overall and 0-4 in the Sun Belt. With just 8 games left in the season, there is not much time to turn the season around, but with 7 games still remaining against conference foes, the season isn't nearly over yet. 

The Golden Panthers next game will be on October 12 against the Louisiana-Monroe Warhawks at University Park.



Cross Country



On October 6, the Golden Panther cross country team took part in the 12th annual Disney World Cross Country Classic in Kissimee, FL. 

The best performer for the women's team was Senior Paola Reategui, who placed 2nd among all women in the 5k  with a time of 18:00:86, 7 seconds better than he previous personal best and just 12 seconds shy of the school record set by fellow senior Deirdra Witherspoon last season.

Junior Alvin Charles was the pace setter for the men's side of the squad, as he finished 7th in the 8k competition with a time of 25:42:22, less than a minute after winner Nicolas Kering from Chattahoochee Tech.

On the strength of those 2 performances plus top 50 finishes from senior Katherine Cardenas and sophomore Isel Ramos, the Golden Panthers women finished 12th out of 44 and the men finished 9th out of 41, ahead of all 11 other schools from the state of Florida that competed. 

The Disney World Classic represented the largest field FIU will compete in this season, with 85 schools and 693 athletes participating. 

The next meet the Golden Panthers will compete in will be the Stetson Invitational on October 11 in DeLand, Florida.



New coaches



Athletic director Pete Garcia announced on October 8 that he had finished the search for head coaches with the hirings of Carlos Casely as the women's tennis head coach and Eric Campbel as the cross country/track and field head coach.

Garcia didn't have to go far to find Casely, who served as the top assistant coach during the team's last 5 seasons, which included 3 straight Sun Belt Conference championships in the last 3 years and appearances in the NCAA tournament.

The tennis team has been one of the few consistently successful programs at the school over the last few years, with 5 appearances in the NCAA tournament over the last 7 years. 

They finished last season with a 19-5 record and a No. 30 national ranking. 

Campbell was a track and field star in high school at Miami Northwestern High during the 90's, and was a national champion in the triple jump in 1996. 

He joined the FIU cross country/track and field coaching staff prior to the 2005 season, and worked as an assistant during that time. 

He worked with numerous talented athletes and was credited with helping Naim Yisrael and Donita Harmon become Sun Belt champions, and in the case of Harmon, a participant in the NCAA Outdor Track and Field Championships last season. 

Both of these coaches will look to help their up and coming programs continue their rises to prominence on the national scale.

Headline: Volleyball streak ends with back to back road losses
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With her team riding high on a nine-game win streak, women's volleyball coach Danijela Tomic heightened intensity in practice in an attempt to keep the team focused. 

Unfortunately, her efforts proved to be no match for human nature, as the Golden Panthers dropped both of their games on the road against Sun Belt Conference foes North Texas and Denver Oct. 5 and 6, respectively.

"I was very upset after those two losses because I didn't think we competed the way we should have," Tomic said. "Nobody likes to lose, but there is a difference when you lose because the other team is better and when you lose because you didn't leave everything you have out on the court. I don't think any of us felt like we played our best after those games."



UNT 3, FIU 0



North Texas (6-13, 2-3) delivered a near-flawless performance, making easy work of the Golden Panthers in a 3-0 (30-25, 30-26, 30-35) win. Sophomore All-American Yarimar Rosa led four Golden Panthers in double figures with her 15-kill, 11-dig performance, but it wasn't nearly enough on a magical day of sorts for North Texas. 

Finishing the game at a .402 clip, the Texans notched its seventh-best hitting percentage in school history, making just seven attack errors over the duration of the match. The Golden Panthers played well, finishing the match with a .303 hitting percentage but they simply could not stop North Texas on the other end of the court.

One bright spot was senior Anita Szymanska, who complemented Rosa with 12 kills on a scorching .476 hitting clip. Sophomore Olga Vergun and freshman Ines Medved had ten kills each.

According to Tomic, it was poor communication that led to the streak ending defeat.

"Against North Texas, I thought our passing really broke down and that's why we didn't have a good game," she said. "They had a perfect match and there was just no way we could stop them. They had their best match of the year against us."



Denver 3, FIU 1



Two days later, the taste of disappoint grew greater after Denver pulled off a 3-1 (30-32, 30-22, 30-23, 30-20) shocker. The Golden Panthers seemed poised and focused after pulling off a tough 32-30 first set win, but once Denver adjusted its game plan, the Golden Panthers failed to respond for the remainder of the match. 

Once again, Rosa led the team with 21 kills and 15 digs in the loss. Medved reached double-figure kills for the second time in as many games with 11 and senior setter Keila Oliveira distributed 47 assists. Alyssa Hampton highlighted Denver's offense with 20 kills and 16 digs. Kim Muller added 19 kills and Holly Benson did her part with 13 kills in the upset win for Denver.

Despite the two tough losses, Tomic said she is still optimistic about the rest of the season.

"We have to learn from this," she said. "We have to turn this experience into something good. We played two very good teams but we didn't respond and play up to our potential. Whoever we play is going to bring their best game against us so we have to be on the defense always. 

"I would rather take two losses now than to take it in November in the tournament."

The Golden Panthers (11-4, 6-2 SBC), will play arguably the two most important games of the regular season when they take on conference rivals Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee at Pharmed Arena on Oct. 12 and 13, respectively.

Headline: NCAA VIOLATIONS: FIU admits athletics' transgressions
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The NCAA Enforcement Staff alleges that FIU lacked institutional control by placing inadequate systems and resources related to advising, monitoring the eligibility of student-athletes, and applying for NCAA financial aid and legislation.

Vice President of Enforcement David Price sent a "notice of allegations" to University President Modest A. Maidique Oct. 1 detailing that the institution violated several bylaws allowing 40 ineligible student-athletes to compete during the 2002-2003 through 2006-2007 academic years.

The University investigated and self-reported the transgressions to the NCAA.

"The problem is that FIU lacked the resources, manpower and adequate personnel," said Athletic Director Pete Garcia.

The University has hired three more compliance officers along with the Student-Athlete Academic Center doubling the number of tutors from seven to 14 along with purchasing new computers this year. Also more opportunities exist for student-athletes to take summer courses. FIU has invested about $250,000 towards improving the SAAC and its resources.

"This is a huge setback for the whole University," Garcia said. "The only good thing is that we've put in the right systems to move forward."

The NCAA reported that FIU violated bylaws concerning full-time enrollment, the five-year rule and progress-toward-degree requirements.

Thirty-seven student-athletes, who enrolled prior to Aug. 1, 2003, competed while ineligible by not completing enough credit hours to fulfill the progression-toward-degree requirements.

Fourteen of those 37 student-athletes from various sports did not complete an average of 12 semester hours in their Fall and Spring semesters or a total of 24 hours since the previous fall term.

During the 2004 football season, a student-athlete competed for a sixth year of eligibility exceeding the five-year rule.

In addition, FIU incorrectly applied NCAA financial aid legislations from the academic years of 2004-2005 through 2006-2007 resulting in men's soccer, women's soccer and women's golf exceeding NCAA financial aid limits. Thus, FIU violated NCAA bylaws that stipulated that each specific sport has a financial aid award limit.

An infraction report from Aug. 25, 2005 showed that FIU broke NCAA rules. Therefore, the recent allegations are the second record of FIU violating NCAA bylaws and is now subject to penalties under repeat violators, which may include the prohibition of some or all outside competition in the sport involved for one or two sports seasons.

"We are resilient and confident that we can overcome this," Garcia said. "President Maidique has been in constant communication with NCAA President Miles Brand."

FIU is required to send a written response with the necessary records to confirm or disprove the validity of the allegations by Dec. 4.

The NCAA also requests all information on other possible violations discovered by the institution as result of its findings. Some of the records include enrollment dates of student-athletes at FIU and any other two or four-year institution and the reasons behind the NCAA violations.

FIU must provide a detailed description of any corrective or disciplinary actions against current and former athletics department staff members.

The NCAA Committee on Infractions may decide to terminate the employment of all staff members who knowingly engaged in or condoned a major violation.

"It was nobody's intent to violate the rules of compliance," Garcia said.

The NCAA Committee on Infractions is set to review the response through an in-person hearing Feb. 15, 2008 and Feb. 16, 2008. 

The NCAA will notify Maidique of the official hearing date where he is required to attend. 

Select University representatives including Garcia, Faculty Athletics Representative Stephen Fain and Sun Belt Conference Associate Commissioner Rick Mello who served as athletic director from June 2000 through October 2006 are also mandated to attend the hearing.

The bulk of the violations occurred while Mello served as athletic director. He declined to comment on the matter.

Presently, the allegations are major violations but the University may send evidence within the written response to reduce the allegations to secondary violations. 

Self-disclosure is considered when determining the penalties issued. Every sport except tennis and softball was involved in at least one allegation.

Headline: Tuition: Legislature to vote on
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
The Legislature will vote on Oct. 12 whether or not to pass a 5 percent tuition increase for in-state residents at all Florida public universities for the Spring 2008 semester. If passed, the tuition increase must survive a veto by Gov. Charlie Crist.

Also on the agenda for the Legislature to vote on are two separate bills that tie the price of tuition with the cost of living and a technology fee up to 5 percent of tuition. 

If approved, there will be automatic increases in the future that would reflect inflation levels.

Douglas Warzok, Vice President of Academic Affairs, said that tying tuition increases to the cost of living would provide universities better planning from year to year. If the tuition increase survives the governor's veto, Warzok said that it would generate $2.5 million for the next full year and help offset the $3.7 million reduction that the University has to deal with this academic year.

FIU is slated to lose $7 million in state funding after the Legislature approved to cut $1.1 billion from the overall state budget to make up for a lack of tax revenue it has recieved.

"This tuition increase was long overdue. We hope this is an indication that they are going to organize and focus more on education," Warzok said. If the increase is approved, Warzok said that additional funding would go toward student services, hiring additional faculty and financial aid.

The increase in tuition comes amid a debate between the Board of Governors and the Legislature, which has the power to set tuition costs. The BOG joined a lawsuit filed by former Florida governor Bob Graham on July 6 that would strip the Legislature of any power to set tuition.

Mark Rosenberg, Chancellor of the State University system, said that the court case is independent of the Legislature's decision.

"The Legislature recognizes that students are not getting the quality. This is an effort by the Legislature to stop the free fall of education," Rosenberg said. "I think that this indicates that the BOG and the legislature has the ability to work more closely together." 

The technology fee of up to 5 percent of tuition would not go into effect until 2009-10 to pay for computers and other instructional technology resources. Boards of Trustees at each of the 11 Florida public universities would decide whether to charge the fee and how much it should be.

Warzok said that the technology fee would go towards improving technology for students, better access to technology in the classroom and a broader wireless network. 

Bill Kaczor of The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Headline: Accident survivors emphasize boat safety
Author: Maria Chercoles / News Director
&nbsp;
While the survivors of last year's Columbus Day Regatta accident that killed two FIU students are still piecing their lives back together, they returned to the regatta site one year later with a new purpose.  

"Need help? Just Light the Way" is the name of the campaign created by the accident survivors, relatives of the victims and their friends to raise awareness about the dangers of the ocean.

This, they believe, will help prevent more accidents such as the one that killed students Monica Burguera and James Noel Pou last year.

"We couldn't let this happen again, so we thought that by telling other people what happened to us and informing them about boat safety was the best way to prevent it," said Andres Perez, who survived the accident that took the life of his girlfriend of more than four years, Burguera; and his roommate, Noel Pou. 

The accident took place when their broken-down rental boat, which was being towed back to shore, was hit from behind by a 35-feet powerboat. 

Together with Burguera's family and about 100 volunteers, Perez spent last weekend's regatta distributing flyers, t-shirts, hats and flashlights at 14 different marinas throughout Miami.  

"We went through such a hard time that we don't want anyone else to go through the same. Saving one life will make the effort worth it," said Mayra Burguera, the mother of Monica Burguera.

A Web site and a Facebook.com group helped spread the word about the campaign, which quickly raised solidarity among the FIU community. The Facebook group reached over 1,000 members in just three days. 

Perez, 21, is now trying to reincorporate into his life after having to drop from FIU last Fall. The accident left him with a broken hip and pelvis that paralyzed the lower part of his body. 

Although doctors told him that he might not be able to walk again, therapy in Miami and later in Puerto Rico helped him recover. Still, he can't run yet and continues doing therapeutic exercises. 

The accident also cost him a finger and a broken wrist.

However, he said, the injuries is not what hurt him the most.

"The physical damage is not the worst. Medicine is so advanced that I was able to receive the help I needed, but the psychological damage of losing Monica and James is the hardest part," Perez said.     

Perez returned to FIU this Fall to finish the last two years of his bachelor's in health sciences and nutrition. He wants to be an orthopedic, he jokes, to "return the favor." 

His family flew from Puerto Rico for the weekend and stood next to him as he distributed flyers to everyone entering the Key Biscayne Crandon Marina.

Joel Cardona, Angel Accornero and Jose Gonzalez, who were also in the accident last year, helped with the "Need Help?" campaign. The rest of the accident survivors are currently in Puerto Rico.

The accident left Cardona, 23, with a fractured clavicle and crane and with severe cuts throughout his back, but he agrees with Perez in that the injuries are what matter the least.

"They were very special people. You wouldn't have over a hundred volunteers working all weekend like this for everyone," Cardona said.

Despite his injuries, Cardona returned to FIU weeks after the accident and is currently finishing his second year in the architecture master's program.

"What drove my decision not to leave school was that I believed that continuing my studies and life was the best way I could cope with my recovery rather than staying at home thinking about what happened," Cardona said.  

Perez and Cardona received psychological counseling to help them reincorporate into their lives, and Cardona said the accident did have a certain affect on academics, but added that FIU has been very sensitive to the situation by sending cards, letters and even calling the victims and families involved.

Perez feels good to be back in FIU and added that now that he is taking all the classes he dropped last Fall, the same professors who sent him letters last year recognized him and have been helpful. 

"It was a difficult part of my life, but it's a chapter I want to close. I wanted to come back to FIU and finish my studies. It's difficult, but I'm here, fighting," Perez said.

The Burguera family is now trying to start a foundation to change and reinforce the water safety rules.

The campaign was already affective this year, Perez said.

Contrary to last year, no jet skis were allowed in the area this time. Also, a number of people were arrested Saturday night for drunk boating.

"Seeing so many of us volunteering, the gulf guards are realizing the size of the problem and now are enforcing more the rules," Perez said.

Opposite to what one would assume, Perez and Cardona still enjoy the ocean and admire boats. While distributing flyers, they couldn't take their eyes away from some of the luxurious boats entering the marina.

Perez said he returned to the accident site after recuperating to throw flowers in the water.

"It's like a car accident. Those things happen and it doesn't mean you won't ride a car again. You have to understand it could happen to anyone, anywhere," Perez said.

With a master's degree in pre-Columbian Andean art and a doctorate in history, Damian became a knowledgeable resource for the two-year investigation that started in 2005. She had been conducting workshops with customs for a long time, helping them to distinguish authentic pieces of art from fakes. So when the ICE needed an expert eye in Peruvian art, they went to Damian. 

"The expertise in identifying real art is developed by years of looking," Damian said. "A scholar learns the specifics of a culture's aesthetics. Peruvian art, for example, has a characteristic way of representing faces or deities in their art."

Among the artifacts identified by Damian was a clay vessel that dated back as far as 3,500 B.C. There were also pots, vases, textiles, shrouds and various pieces of jewelry. Most of the artifacts were stolen from museums and graves.

The ICE and BSO pursued the smugglers through a series of sting operations. Undercover cops would purchase artifacts from the smugglers and bring them to Damian to examine. 

"After a while, you get to know what's right and wrong. The easiest way to identify them is to pick out the fakes. They have obvious flaws in style," Damian said.

The ICE made contact with at least one consistent buyer and worked their way closer to the lead smuggler. Eventually, the trail led to Ugo Bagnato, an Italian man in his late 60s, guilty for the theft and sale of 412 artifacts in total.

Ana Estrada, a third-time graduate student of Damian's, attended the professor's ceremony at the Lowe Art Museum at the University of Miami where she spoke about the investigation. 

Ana recently spent some time working and studying in an art museum in Paracas, a small village on the coast of Peru. 

She joined a workshop to renovate an archeological textile only to have it stolen from the museum a couple of weeks later. 

"The museums were not well protected and they didn't have security guards," she said. 

When she saw the pictures of the artifacts, she noticed that "some of the ceramic pieces still had the museum's acquisition numbers taped on the back."

 According to Damian, the Peruvian government was happy to have these irreplaceable icons of their culture and history returned with the success of the investigation.

Molly Orahood had a promising future. Those who knew her well and those who didn't agree that her presence was all that was needed to cheer up a room.  	

"Molly was an extremely vibrant and happy person," said Giselle Gutierrez, a Delta Phi Epsilon sister in an October 2006 article in The Beacon. "No matter what was wrong she could lift your spirits."

Behind her zeal for life was a tragic past; a plane crash that took the lives of both her parents and left her in a coma for over six months. She was able to come back from that tragedy and make a full recovery. 

Orahood never let her past ruin her life. When she enrolled at FIU she joined Delta Phi Epsilon and quickly became friends with many of the group's members.

"We met my first year of college," said Ebe Messanotte, a Delta Phi Epsilon sister who knew Orahood well. "We used to hang out in the Everglades hall all the time. She always made me laugh."

Tragedy struck Orahood once again during the 2006 Memorial Day weekend when a drunk driver caused her to have a near-fatal car accident that left her in a coma once more.

"I was in shock," Messanotte said. "I was the first to find out and I thought it wasn't real."

With Orahood's medical expenses quickly depleting her trust fund, Delta Phi Epsilon founded the Keep S.O.B.E.R. (Subsidizing Others By Expediting Rehabilitation) foundation. Its mission: to raise awareness about the consequences of drunk driving and raise funds for people like Orahood. 

The first event the organization held was "A Night For Molly," a semiformal banquet that helped raise $20,000 for Orahood. 

"In Greek-wide philanthropy it was record setting for FIU," said Kenneth Gelok, the president of Pi Kappa Alpha and co-coordinator for the second annual "A Night For Molly."

This year's event will take place Oct. 12 from 7:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. in the Graham Center ballrooms. Individual seats will cost $15 during presales and tables of 10 seats are available for $125.  

"Our tables are going fast," Gelok said. "I'm expecting to sell out." 

To help cover costs for the event, organizers requested a $1500 apportionment from the Student Government Association to help cover costs of food, which was unanimously approved by the SGA finance committee, according to Sergio Ibarra Bolanos, the SGA comptroller.

According to Gelok, planning for this year's event was much more organized than last year's. Initial planning started in August with weekly meetings. 

A year ago, Orahood was still in a coma. While today she is awake and receiving physical therapy. 

"She still doesn't have all her memories back and does not remember me," Messanotte said. "It really hurts but there is hope."

"She has gotten better," Gelok said. "This year we wanted it to be less about the accident and more about progress and drunk driving awareness."

The overall theme of "A Night for Molly" has been changed to a more lighthearted one according to Cleo Fernandez the Delta Phi Epsilon coordinator of philanthropy and co-coordinator of the event.

"Support for 'A Night for Molly' has been great," Fernandez said. 

"I'm so grateful to everyone who was shown support."

"I hope a lot of people show up," Messanotte said. "It's not just for Molly, but for everyone who has suffered because of drunk driving."
