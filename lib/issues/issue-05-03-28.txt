Subheadline: Hospitality Management vs. Le Cordon Bleu
Author: Ruthie Metcalfe / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The recent Southern Wine and Food Festival brought the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management some much needed exposure.  Johnson and Wale's and The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale are the only competition HTM has had - until now.

There is a new addition to South Florida schools that offer training in the culinary arts: Le Cordon Bleu. However, according to administrators, it will not affect the growth of HTM.

"Le Cordon Bleu is a good school if what you want to do is learn to be a cook, but if you want to be the restaurant manager or become an owner, then you should look into going to a hospitality program like the one here at FIU," said Lee C. Dickson, associate dean for the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management. 

Erika Davis, enrollment manager of HTM, thinks the managerial aspect of FIU's culinary program attracts students and that this is something Le Cordon Bleu fails to offer.

"We provide an industry specific program, so our students are better equipped. Our students take advantage of our food preparation courses, but our major focus is management," said Davis. "The result is that our students are prepared to succeed not only in culinary arts, but on a hospitality management and tourism level."

HTM offers its students a comprehensive program, one that furnishes students with a bachelor's degree.According to its website, HTM is ranked sixth out of all hospitality schools in the nation, as reported by the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Education. 

Most HTM students didn't appear to know about Le Cordon Bleu and what it has to offer. 

"I don't know too much about it," said Stewart Bowman, a senior in the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management who graduates this semester.  "I'd first heard about that school when I applied to college, and at that time they didn't have a facility in South Florida. But I decided to come to FIU, because it was both an in-state program and known as one of the best schools offering training in my field," he said.  

Junior Tsehaye Clennon, an HTM student who is specializing in hotel enlargement, did not have much to say about Le Cordon Bleu either.

"I heard about Le Cordon Bleu in the newspaper, but I don't know anyone who goes there," said Clennon. "That school is more for kids who only want to be chefs."

D.J. Suarez, a third year hospitality management student, pointed out the extensive training FIU hospitality professors have.

"FIU is one of the best schools for hospitality management in the nation, with some of the best teachers. Chip Cassidy, one of our wine technologies instructors, is one of the foremost wine connoisseurs in the U.S.," said Suarez.

Because Le Cordon Bleu is not an accredited school, the credits students earn there are non-transferable. 

"We're only allowed to accept transfer students from schools that have been accredited by The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, or SACS," said Joseph J. West, dean for the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management. "Schools such as Johnson and Wales are accredited by this association, so we could accept students transferring from that school to ours."

Because schools like Le Cordon Bleu and the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale are not accredited, FIU does not accept students from these facilities. West said that students who transfer from such non-accredited schools would come in as freshman. According to the March 3 addition of The Miami Herald, administrators at Le Cordon Bleu didn't expect to enroll more than 300 students by winter. They enrolled 430 students.

With locations in London, Paris, Tokyo and now Miami, Le Cordon Bleu is expanding globally. It offers a 15-month program that specializes exclusively in culinary arts. Students who graduate from this institution will receive an associate's degree in culinary arts. 

West is confident that Le Cordon Bleu will not affect the enrollment status of FIU's hospitality management program. 

"We're two completely different institutions," he said. "[At Le Cordon Bleu] you can only learn to be a cook."

Headline: Payroll system requirements change, headaches abound
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
James Lucas, a sophomore who has been working at the University Park Language Lab for 14 months, takes a walk every other Friday to the Human Resources office to pick up his paycheck.

Though most of his co-workers receive their paychecks through direct deposit - a system used by Florida and other states in which money earned through state jobs is directly placed into an employee's bank account on payday - Lucas was told the method was optional and thus never applied for the procedure.

"I knew I was going to transfer out of the school, so why would I want to do direct deposit if I'm only going to be here a few more months?" said Lucas.

He was surprised when he found a letter earlier in the semester attached to his pay stub stating that direct deposit sign-up would now be mandatory for all university employees beginning Feb. 4.

"I didn't understand why I had to do it. I just have to work here like one more month, so if I have to get direct deposit for that one month, that's pretty silly," he said.

Many students, faculty and university staff who also do not receive payments through the system, but who will continue to be employed at FIU next year, have not been able to escape the mandate so easily.

However, due to delays in the processing of direct deposit applications by the state comptroller's office during the winter break, the ultimatum for the system sign-up was changed to March 4, a move assistant vice president for Human Resources, Paul Michaud, said might have given employees more time to become better informed about the payment method.

"What many had to realize in that time was that this move isn't necessarily a bad thing," said Michaud. "The benefits of having direct deposit, of course, are that you're guaranteed to have the money [in you bank account] on the day of payment, and you can start writing checks faster."

Out of the university's 8,300 employees, Michaud said that only 800 - 900 checks were not delivered through direct deposit by the deadline.

"We had a pretty long line, primarily of students, going out into the hallway, waiting to get paid on that date," he said. "Still, we were all elated to see how smoothly the operation went, with only one student bringing complaints."

Though direct deposit has been optional in the past, its adoption by state universities has now become mandatory after the establishment of Florida Statute 110.113, which made it the official payment method for all government offices.

"The university has to comply with the law, and this is a law we're trying to enforce," said Michaud.

In order to facilitate employees' transition into the system, the University Credit Union was invited to the HR offices on the deadline date to help those who did not have a bank account. 

They signed up students on the spot and advised those with existing accounts that the state would not issue direct deposit to employees with bad credit.

"There's a lot of information that people don't understand, and not just students, but permanent employees who have been here a while and are suspicious of the system," said Michaud.

According to the administrator, many of the 400 checks that were not picked up on the deadline week belonged to adjunct professors who either did not know  about the system change because they do not frequent the university often or who have other sources of income, and therefore do not place high priority on picking up the checks on time.

"Students and professors have to make sure everything's in order before their direct deposit goes through, and if they have any problems or questions, they should call the Tallahassee offices," Michaud said. The number for the Department of Financial Services is 808-413-7262.

Although many will be signing up for the direct deposit system within the following weeks, some think that the university should not enforce the method on employees.

"Making it mandatory takes away a person's choice to what kind of payment they want," said sophomore Carolina Benitez, who has been working at the UP Panther Card offices since spring 2004 and is signed up for direct deposit. "I mean, I don't know why no one would want it, but if they don't, it's their choice and they're entitled to it."

Michaud said he understood that complaints would arise but is positive that the long-term benefits of the system will help convince employees to sign up.

"We're hoping, in essence, to eventually have a paperless system; one that will make operations easier on all of us. This will facilitate payment, not hinder it," he said.

Check pick ups will take place from payday on Friday until the following Wednesday between 3 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the payroll departments in Primera Casa 220 at UP and at the Library, room 322, at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

This procedure will last until the end of the semester.

Headline: Ending the Iraq war has more precedence than eliminating cell phones
Subheadline:  
Author: Fresh34@aol.com
&nbsp;
Dear Editor,

It seems to me that Mr. Muela has too much time on his hands when he wrote his piece on "cell phone disease". Clearly he should use his time more appropriately and be more concerned about pertinent issues that affect young Americans such as that 1000 plus have been unneccarily slaughtered in an unjust and expensive war. Our country is considered a pariah in the eyes of the world and young people are going to have to bear this financial cross for years to come. Also he should be aware that, he like other young people may still get called to be sacrificed when this administration leaves Iraq in shambles and takes on Iran in the not so distant future. I believe ending this debacle and saving our brethen's lives has more precedence then eliminating cell phones

Headline: Reply to Editorial on Parking Problems
Subheadline:  
Author: rharp002@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
In reply to the editorial discussing the 'never-ending battle of parking at FIU' I feel the need to comment on the exaggeration and provocative tone of this piece.  Whilst I agree parking in the past has been less than bearable, with the opening of the new garages parking is no longer the hassle it used to be.  The Blue and Gold parking Garages hold 1000 cars each, and the Red and Panther Garages 1800 each.  That's in addition to at least 10 other open lots.

Yes there's a floor and a half in each garage devoted to faculty, but they pay more for their decals.  There is always at least a floor free in the Red Garage, and the Panther Garage usually has even more space within.  Being late for class due to parking is not a valid excuse.  The only 'problem' with parking on campus, is that most people seem more content to cruise lots for 20 minutes looking for a prime space within spiting distance of their classroom, rather than walk the extra 5 minutes to class.  FIU does not offer drive-in lectures.  

The fair is in town for less than 3 weeks (3 out of 52 is less than 6% of the year), and donates a significant sum of money to FIU in addition to funding various charities and scholarships.  To complain about the loss of some parking to the 'carnies', very derogatory by the way, seems trivial at best, spoilt at worst.  Once again, the voice of a few leaves FIU looking ungrateful, uncaring and selfish.

This kind of attitude destroys school morale with no benefit.  If you need something to complain about, complain about lack of school spirit, and how in a university with an enrolment close to 40,000, over 1,000 faculty and 100,000 alumni, we can't pull together a crowd of 15,000 to keep our football team in division 1A.

Headline: Indoor football team gives second chance
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
For football players coming out of college who don't get drafted into the NFL, life can be hard without football. With the exception of the Arena Football League in Orlando, there are no other professional football teams close to Miami. This is was led former Miami Dolphins receiver Oronde Gadsden to bring the Miami Morays to the city.

The Morays are part of the National Indoor Football League and will play home games at the Miami Arena. Gadsden is thrilled to be part of the Morays.

"I am excited for the opportunity to be the owner of a National Indoor Football League team [to play] in the Miami Arena," said Gadsden. "I think with my contacts in the football world and the players I want to bring to the team, I think we can field an exciting and brand new product that everyone can be proud of, and ultimately bring a winning football team to Miami."

The head coach of the Morays is Larry Little, former Dolphin and Hall of Fame guard. He is pleased with the talent he has witnessed in practice and hopes players will advance in life through the Morays.

"A lot of guys have hopes of moving up and hopefully some of them will," said Little. "I'm looking forward to this year [because] we have a lot of talent here. Hopefully we can bring some excitement to this area."

There are many well-known players on the Morays roster including Ethenic Sands and Nate Brooks, former University of Miami standouts. The most notable local player is Calvin Jackson, a former Dolphins cornerback who started all 16 games in the 1997 season under coach Jimmy Johnson.

Sands was known for reliability and team-first attitude at UM. Willing to switch positions with the Hurricanes, he played quarterback, return specialist and wide receiver, but finished in 2002 with no call from an NFL team.

Now he is hoping that a productive season with the Morays indoor football team can impress NFL scouts.

"I've been playing football since I was a kid, trying to get to the next level - the NFL," said Sands. "That's my main goal, to do whatever I have to do to get there, from playing here [to] Arena Football and Canadian - whatever it takes for me to get there."

For Sands and many others, the Morays may be one of the final chances to land the eye of an NFL scout. Leslie Shepherd, receiver's coach and seven-year NFL veteran, told the players his story about how hard it was and how he finally made it.

"I shared my story with the guys and what it took me to get to that point. It's a lot of hard work and dedication," said Shepherd. "They see the big picture. They see me playing on TV and it all starts with working."

Gadsden's goals for now are to have a competitive team on the field. He is also hoping players like Sands can help the team reach that point.

"When I was trying to get to the NFL, I knew I could play," said Gadsden. "And with Sands, he is a great player, and I went through the same thing that he is going through. I see the same fire in his eyes, and hopefully through this team he can get recognized."

Moray players are paid $200 per game and are served three meals per day. They are also provided with housing by the team. According to Mark Fischel, Morays director for Media Relations, Gadsden provides all the accomodations for the players because he wants to run it like an NFL team. 

The Morays open their home schedule on April 2 against the Lubbock Lonestars at the Miami Arena.

Headline: "Robots" mixes child-friendly plot with adult undertones
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Stars like Ewan McGregor, Robin Williams, Halle Berry and Mel Brooks team up in the latest animated feature from Twentieth Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios: "Robots." The film opened March 11 and raked in an estimated $36.5 million over the weekend, earning the number one spot in the box office. It's also being shown in IMAX format.

From the creators of "Ice Age," the digitally animated "Robots" features an even more marketable cast of vocal talent and a greater eye for detail. 

The narrative is simple enough for a child to follow, but also contains sophisticated humor and social criticism for adult viewers who might otherwise grow restless.

The vividness of detail is impressive. The first few moments of "Robots," where the frame pans from sky to street, are indistinguishable from live-action footage. 

Then life (or metal life) begins to stir, and you're introduced to Rivet City, a town populated by robot people, robot birds and robot facilities. Everything here pertains to parts and gears.

While you find no human characters in "Robots," all of the machines have human voices and human feelings. 

Many films depict the struggle between humans and machines, but this one is solely about the machines and the struggles they face in their own society - a society not dissimilar to our own.

McGregor lends his voice to the protagonist, Rodney Copperbottom, a robot constructed by his human "parents" out of hand-me-down spare parts. (This process replaces love-making in this PG-rated movie.) 

After high school, Rodney becomes a waiter in Rivet City at the same restaurant where his father has worked all his life as a dishwasher. 

Tired of the lack of opportunities in the provincial town, Rodney, whose true dream is to become a patent inventor, moves to the bustling metropolis of Robot City.

Rodney's father encourages him to pursue his ambitions despite their bleak outlook. Surely McGregor could relate to this, as his own father was similarly supportive.  

The hardships Rodney confronts in Robot City resemble the familiar "rags-to-riches" struggles of innumerable Hollywood celebrities.

Upon his arrival, Rodney comes across Fender (Williams), a robot whose spare parts are even looser and rustier than his and whose humor isn't all that sharp. 

The two bunk together in Robot City and join forces against the evil corporate leader Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), who wants to take affordable spare parts off the market and force robots to buy expensive upgrades. 

Robots who don't comply are taken to the Chop-Shop, where they're turned into something else. 

All this constitutes a veiled criticism of health benefit cuts, as well as of our society's obsession with fashionable outfits and plastic surgery.

The action sequences in "Robots" are perfectly synchronized with music, a concept first introduced in 1940 by the Disney cartoon feature classic "Fantasia." Don't miss Rodney's thrill-ride across Robot City and the later sequence of falling dominoes, which highlights the movie's meticulously detailed animation.

In the middle of the action, you find, of course, a little G-rated romance. 

Rodney's unlikely female partner is the beautiful, shiny and fashionable robot, Cappy (Halle Berry). 

With Rodney, she abandons corporate mentality and discovers what inner beauty is, becoming less of a robot and more like a human being. 

The character of Bigweld (Brooks) is an unrealistically nice mogul who gives chances to truly talented inventors and encourages people to be themselves. 

But he's hidden somewhere, displaced from his own company by money-hungry Ratchet. It's up to none other than Obi Wan Kenobi - excuse me, Rodney - to get to the bottom of things and change robot world with his ingeniousness and big iron heart.

"Robots" is entertaining, colorful and full of details - some of these subtle, some awe-inspiring. 

On the other side of its positive message of inner beauty, the film picks on our own society's mantra: "Why be you when you can be new?"

Headline: Cruise Control
Author: Gerardo Tumani / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Beacon is starting a new series involving the hottest cars in the market for 2005. Many models from several car brands will be discussed along with what the car has to offer the consumer. 

By now you've probably seen television commercials about Chevrolet's "American Revolution." 

General Motors wants you, the consumer, to take note that Chevy's cars and trucks are new and competitive. 

Aveo $9,995

 It is now 2005: What does Chevrolet have in store today and for the near future? Let's start with the bargain basement Aveo. 

Introduced in 2004 and made by Daewoo, the Aveo is a little runabout that is great for those tight beach parking spaces. 

But don't let the small outside size fool you. Inside, the Aveo is surprisingly spacious with room for five adults. With gas prices going north, Aveo's fuel efficiency and gas tank size will not break your bank account. 

Cobalt $14,190

Next up is the all-new 2005 Cobalt. The Cobalt is smaller on the inside, less fuel-efficient, and because it's a heavier car, with the Ecotec 2.2 L engine, it's actually slower than its predecessor, the Cavalier. 

However, the car is quieter and more refined. 

It's equipped with a trip computer that gives the driver information such as the outside temperature, a trip odometer, warning messages and a programmable feature. 

There is an option of a 205 horsepower supercharged 2.0L Ecotec engine to spruce up your go-fast needs. 

Impala $23,010

This summer, the Impala will get a makeover giving it more power, better fit and a finish with all the latest gizmos, such as side-curtain roof rail airbags and a reengineered safety cage, which will protect you during an accident. General Motors will bring back a V8 with 5.3L of displacement that pumps out 303 horsepower. Die-hard Impala enthusiasts will criticize that the rear wheels are not powered like its earlier versions, but the presence of a V8 is a start. 

Monte Carlo $22,940

Remove the two rear doors from the Impala and you get the Monte Carlo. The "Monte" will get a subtle face-lift and the same engines from the Impala for the 2006 model year. Since it's based on the chassis of the Impala, it will share the same new 3.5L, 3.9L V6s and 5.3L V8, pumping out 210 horsepower, 240 horsepower and 303 horsepower, respectively. Like the Impala, the 5.3L V8 will have "Displacement-On-Demand" (DOD), which shuts down four cylinders when you are cruising or at a red light, so you can save fuel when all eight cylinders are not needed. 

Corvette $44,510

The last Chevy car is the "American Icon" Corvette. Now in its sixth generation, it's the best yet! Standard engine is 400 horsepower from a rip-roaring 6.0L V8 engine. 

The latest Corvette has been refined to match sports cars that cost twice, or even three times the price of a Corvette. 

Want more power? Wait until the fall of 2005, when the Corvette Z06 with 500 horsepower from a 7.0L (427 cu-in) V8 will give the all-mighty Dodge Viper a run for its money. Packed with the latest technology and tires that look like they came from a steamroller, this beast is ready for Ferrari and Lamborghini hunting.

Silverado $19,040

Remember the "Like a Rock" commercials showing the beefy Chevy trucks? Well, the tough Chevy truck image continues with the Silverado. Introduced in 1999, the Silverado can be customized to your liking with a work truck trim or a luxurious trim that resembles the Cadillac. 

You can also get the option of single, extended or crew cabs. Engine choices include either a more efficient 4.3L V6 to a high horsepower 6.0L 345HP V8. Lastly, a choice of different pick-up bed length is available to suite your needs - from a "flareside" design to the famous "Dooly" design which carries four wheels in the back, just like a semi-truck. 

Colorado $15,710

Want a smaller truck with the look of its big brother, the Silverado? Then take a gander at the Colorado. 

Introduced in 2004 to replace the S10, it's now wider and roomier and considered a mid-size truck. It has a powerful 2.8L I-4 and a quiet 3.5L I-5. You have three suspension choices: high riding off-road suspension, mid-level comfort suspension and road-hugging sport suspension. 

Colorado has the look you want.

Equinox $21,885

Looking for a small truck with a roof to cover your books? The Equinox, introduced in 2005, is an SUV made for paved roads. Roomy, all-around and attractively styled like no other SUV in its class, this model replaced the Suzuki-based Tracker. 

The Equinox's power comes from a 3.4L V6 with a 185 horsepower engine. Inside, you will find a practical space with a rear seat and front passenger seat that folds forward; you can easily place long cargo, like a surfboard, in the car. 

Lastly, the Equinox offers the option of All Wheel Drive (AWD) which means power is sent to all wheels, which comes in handy during foul weather conditions. 

Tahoe/Suburban $36,765

The Tahoe and Suburban, introduced in 2000, is based on the Silverado. Inside you'll find wide-open spaces. Yet, this vehicle is able to fit in a garage. With the Tahoe, you can have a 4.8L V8 with 285 horsepower or a 5.3L V8 rated at 295 horsepower. 

Inside, you have options that will make your living room jealous. Some options are a new navigation system so you won't get lost, rear DVD player, XM satellite radio and a standard Onstar system. 

Onstar is a system specifically made by GM that allows you to speak with an operator for directions, look for a hotel or even open your doors via satellite if your keys are locked in. 

At 21 inches longer, with the Suburban, you get more interior room and stronger V8s. A 5.3L V8 with 295 horsepower, a 6.0L V8 with 335 horsepower and 8.1L V8 with 320 horsepower is another feature found in the Suburban. This engine has more pulling power torque then the smaller V8s.

SSR $43,180

If you want to take that long trip with your significant other, look no further then the retro-styled SSR convertible pick-up. 

Introduced in 2004, this year it has a slightly less tuned Corvette engine with 390 horsepower, 90 more ponies than last year, and now you can combine it with a new 6-speed manual. 

This version finally matches looks with power.

Though I must admit this generation seems more androidish than human and it shouldn't be a surprise if one day machines do take over and control us I still believe the writer for the "Hanging Up" article expressed more than his thoughts in the piece.

Really the whole thing over the parking for the fair is rediculous. First they close down the large parking lot for students in the housing quad then they give all the available parking to the fair. What is the administration thinking. Students should be the primary concern for FIU administratin, not the fair. Yes the fair may have contributed to FIU but, the least the fair could do is continue giving FIU students free entry or discounts, which apperantly they have discontinued. Furthurmore, have you seen the ammount of parking area there is for the fair in the big lot right in front of the entrance. I really doubt that FIU is contributing very much parking space considering this.

Soccer in Miami
Submitted by jeanniebelgrave on June 13, 2004 - 07:09. Miami [NSHP.org] 

Miami is a developing city with a state of the art Basketball Arena, with a College American Football Stadium, it is currently fighting to get a Baseball Stadium, and now the inevitable sport is kicking in fast,soccer.

Soccer is more than a sport, it is a world culture, and it is roaring more and more in this beautiful city of Miami.. Around this metropolis, you can find more than four soccer stores, restaurants where the attraction is to watch a soccer match, soccer summer camps are offered in a variety of schools, and even Hispanic broadcasting networks deliver their soccer events to the rest of United States from Miami, Fl.

The citizens of Miami may not notice how soccer will become part of their lives, more TV commercials will show soccer balls or soccer fields, more stores will sell signed merchandise representing the worlds most famous soccer players, more kids and adults will wear "Soccer Fashion.". 

Soccer players will be amongst single women's "dream dates" and if the economy and the fans allow it, Miami will have again a soccer team. 

Miami is a small world rich in cultures, and where variety is, soccer exists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I submitted this article to NSHP.org last year, and I am impressed how right I was and still am. Yesterday, I went to Bayside and found the Gap store decorated with soccer  items.  I felt so proud and happy because  Bayside is one of the main spots for Tourists in South Florida. The fact that a clothing store's main theme is soccer supports my article. More than that, if you watch TV often, you will find that more and more TV commercials have placed a soccer ball somewhere on the shot, even the box office movie " The Pacifier" has a moment where a soccer ball is in the background. While visiting Bayside, I went to the Nike store, and did I guess?Yes, there were soccer items for sale inside the store. To support even more my article, here is a list of places where the passion for soccer is alive here in Miami:

Soccer 7 : Doral

Apo's Cafe : Miami

Patacon La Gota # 5 : North Miami Beach

Ceviches' Palace : Miami Lakes

Casablanca: Coral Springs

Che Titos : Kendall

Mama Vieja : Miami Beach

El Pollon Grill : Miami

El Palacio de Los Jugos: Miami

Flor de La Canela: Miami

Jimmy's Sport Bar: Miami

Las Maracas : Miami

These are only few of the many other places where the passion for soccer is alive. I have a longer list with more than 20 places where our Miami residents and visitors can visit and feel the passion for soccer in Miami.

We will see more and more about soccer in Miami, right now the world cup qualifier tournament is on, soon: Confederations Cup and Gold Cup, and then, the next FIFA World Cup. Not everybody will be able to travel to Germany to the biggest and  most popular sports event in the world, but,  Miami will be roaring "Golaaazo, azo, azo, azo", like the hispanic anchor, Pablo Ramirez from Univision who  screams out of his stomach the scored goal like he never want to end the moment of the goal. All the restaurants, cafes,sports bar/pub, theaters will be "on" or "encendidos" with soccer.  Parents will have to make early reservation for their kid's soccer camps. We have entered a soccer moment in Miami that will not stop, it will only expand.

Headline: Hard work separates Diaz from the pack
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When Dennis Diaz decided to attend FIU three years ago, he knew that all the players were talented at the college level and that to make an impression he would need to work harder than the rest.

While the majority of players have their share of power, speed and arm strength, according to Diaz, that alone won't even get you on the downtown Metro-Rail.

"I think I have good tools, but at this level everybody's good," said Diaz. "What differentiates one person from another is how hard they play and how they react to bad games."

It is obvious that Diaz has this trait. He always gives every ounce of effort.

"My biggest fear is not giving it my all," Diaz said. "I don't want to have one inch [left] to give!"

Obviously, guts alone don't get you to the stage of the game Diaz is at. Diaz is also one of the fastest players in Golden Panthers history and currently holds FIU's career stolen base record.

His speed wreaks havoc on the base paths. Just his presence on first base takes opposing pitchers off their game. All of a sudden, it's not about the hitter, it's about Diaz picking up another stolen base and getting into scoring position.

"My ability to run makes me a unique baseball player," Diaz said. "It gives me an advantage over others."

EARLY STAGES

The journey to baseball supremacy for Diaz started right here in Miami. 

Born an only child to Luis and Ana on Feb. 7, 1983, early in his life he began his ambitiousness that's still with him today.

"My parents always told me that I could do anything," Diaz said. "I've always been the type of person [who] wants something and goes after it."

Diaz went on to play high school baseball at Miami Beach High, where he was named Most Inspiring Athlete and second team All-Dade County.

He hit .420, drove in 17 runs and stole 12 bases, despite missing most of his senior year due to injury.

Diaz had some tough decisions to make after being recruited by Texas A&M, Tennessee, FIU and the University of Miami. But his juggling with the subject only delayed the inevitable. He chose to be a Golden Panther.

"I heard a lot of good things about the baseball program," Diaz said. "I also liked that it was close to home."

One of the key factors in his decision was the coaching of Danny Price. Price, who recently capped his 1,000th win, has touched many players throughout his tenure at FIU, including Diaz.

"The best thing I can say that he has taught me is not even about baseball, it's attitude-wise," Diaz said. "As a freshman here, I got in trouble a couple of times [for being late] and he taught me discipline.  I also used to have a bad attitude when I got out, but he taught me to stay at an even level of play no matter what."

COMING TO FIU

Diaz wasted no time making an impact as a Golden Panther.  In his freshman year he appeared in 50 games (44 as a shortstop), hit .315 and stole 29 bases.

In 2003, he lead the Sun Belt Conference with 26 stolen bases and increased his batting average to .328 with a .429 on-base percentage.

For the great players, there is a time in their careers that sets them apart from the rest and puts them on a higher plateau.

For Diaz, it was his 2004 season when he stole 49 bases, the most in the Sun Belt Conference since current Florida Marlins centerfielder Juan Pierre stole 54 in 1998.

"To be in the same category with that guy (Pierre) on any list is an honor," Diaz said. "He's a tremendous baseball player...I'm going to catch him this year!"

A NEW YEAR, A NEW ATTITUDE

The only way to become great is to never settle. This is one thing Diaz knows he cannot do. Instead of celebrating his achievements, he dedicates himself to the finer aspects of his game that need improvement.

Diaz struck out 58 times last season, the most on the team. 

"A strikeout is something that a lead-off man can't do," Diaz said. "This year I've done a very good job of cutting that down. I've worked with coaches [and] developed a two-strike approach, and it's worked out well for me."

This season, the Golden Panthers have gotten off on the right foot, which means Diaz and his teammates are closer to accomplishing their goal.

"I just want to get to the College World Series and win it," Diaz said. "I have a lot of friends that are in the minor leagues and the one thing they tell me is that this is the last year I will play as a team...I just love being with the guys in the locker room [and] the little band playing in the background, everything."

Headline: Miami fan loyalty comes to life with Heat
Subheadline: COMMENTARY
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If one were to argue that Miami has the worst fan base in all of sports, he/she would have a very valid point.

There never seemed to be any loyalty for teams in South Florida, except for the struggling Dolphins and that took a perfect season.	

We just don't get tied into the hoopla of curses, vintage heroes or past glories. We seem to have better things to do, like go to the beach!

But every once in a while a special season embarks, and for just one year the city of Miami is taken by storm and all its hypocrisies and impatience is put to rest.

It happened in 1984 when the city crowded around the shoulders of Dolphin's quarterback Dan Marino as he carried us to a Super Bowl appearance as well as the record books.

In 1997 we took to the streets of downtown with Bobby Bonilla and Al Leiter to celebrate the Marlin's first World Series championship.  

We even took to the ice to stand by our overachieving Panthers as they got to the Stanley Cup Finals in '96.

Well Miamians, it's that time again.  It's time to roll up your sleeves and rub the dust off your caps because April is just around the corner and the Heat is hotter than ever.



PAST GLORIES



There used to be nothing more exciting in Miami during the late 90s than Miami Heat basketball.

That era was dominated by Tim Hardaway's crossover, Dan Marjele's three-pointers and Alonzo Mourning's blocked shots.

There was nothing better than tuning into Sunshine Network and listening to Dr. Jack Ramsey yell out, "LEEENARD!!" whenever shooting guard Voshon Lenard hoisted a three-ball.

Who could forget the famous Heat and New York Knicks rivalry?  Every Miami resident despised every single player on that team.

The city clapped and cheered when power forward PJ Brown flipped Knick's guard Charlie Ward over his shoulders at the Miami Arena.

They laughed when the Knicks Head coach Jeff  Van Gundy (current Heat coach Stan Van Gundy's brother) latched onto the legs of Mourning to interrupt a brawl between Mourning and Larry Johnson.

Then, they bowed their heads as Allen Houston's deciding shot bounced into the basket to end another brilliant season.

It seemed as if that ball going through the hoop signified the end of a great run.  We all knew that once that shot went in, it was back to normalcy.  

No more crowding into sports bars to make fun of New Yorkers, no more Heat banners waving through the streets and most of all, no more glory days for the Heat franchise.

The years following were marked by a kidney disease for our star center, Alonzo Mourning, a career-ending injury for our point guard, Tim Hardaway and the stepping down of one of the greatest coaches of all-time, Pat Riley.



BETTER DAYS AHEAD



In this 2004-2005 season, the Heat are off to the best start in franchise history.

With five-and-a-half weeks remaining in the season, the Miami Heat clinched their playoff spot and held the highest margin with the second place team in their division.

Thanks to the arrival of Shaquille O'Neal, the Heat is a legitimate contender to win a title every single season.  I don't care what anybody says, that man is the MVP year in and year out.

It doesn't matter what numbers he puts up, the fact is that we didn't stand a chance against the bigger teams a year ago.  

The Heat traded away two of their most promising young players - Lamar Odom and Caron Butler, as well as a proven veteran Brian Grant-for what people called an old, over the hill, fat center. All of a sudden championship bells were ringing in the American Airlines Arena.

Add that with the exhilarating play of one of the most talented up-and-coming players in the league, a well-connected supporting cast and an all-business general manager; what you have is the greatest Miami basketball team ever assembled.



A TRIBUTE TO ITS PAST



I was at the AAA the other day to watch the Milwaukee Bucks play the Heat. What  was just a regular season basketball game against a team that probably won't make the playoffs, seemed like a big reunion.

I looked over at the bench and was overwhelmed by a sense of déjà vu. On one end of the bench was Mourning and to the left of him was Heat's 1991 first-round draft pick, Steve Smith.  

On the other end were former Heat players and current assistant coaches Keith Askins and Bimbo Coles. Two rows up was Hardaway seated next to former Heat standout swingman, Dan Marjele.

That seemed to put everything into perspective. This was meant to be their year. Everything seemed like it was supposed to happen.

The signing of Mourning and Smith served as charity to players that had contributed to the team. Like saying: "Thanks for your contributions. Now here's a championship ring for your troubles."

The Heat are entering the stretch run of the season and gearing toward the playoffs.  

Once again, good times will be relived as the city of Miami soaks in the ambiance of playoff basketball and rides this wave as far as it takes them.

My advice is to enjoy this as much as you can because you never know when a lucky bounce will roll into the basket and signal the end of another era.  

It's a moment that can be taken away from us in a heartbeat with the possibility of never returning again.

Headline: SOFTBALL SUPERSTAR
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Amanda Nealer owns six all-time school softball records and has impressive numbers for the season - a 1.24 ERA and 128 strikeouts in 113.1 innings pitched. Out of the softball team's 20 victories, 10 belong to her.

But despite her greatness and numerous school records, she enjoys nothing more than a good nap in her spare time.

"Between class, practice and games, I'm usually in my room sleeping. Eating and sleeping -- that's pretty much it for me between practice and school. That's all I have time for," said Nealer jokingly. 

Nealer does not see herself as a star. She believes in team effort and explains that she is just part of the team, trying to do her part to help win games. This is quite humble for someone who holds six all-time FIU pitching records and who is considered the best pitcher to ever put on a Golden Panthers uniform by Head coach Kim Gwydir.

"She's been amazing. She's absolutely the best," said Gwydir.

Now in her senior season at FIU, Nealer is prepared to leave behind a softball legacy (unknowingly of course), but not before taking care of the unfinished business that's yet to come.

The Washington native, who was born in Japan while her father served in the Air Force and was stationed in Okinawa, found her way across the country to Miami and FIU. Gwydir approached her about the opportunity and "it just sounded like a cool place to go." 

As soon as Nealer arrived at FIU, signs of greatness began to appear. In 2002, her first season with the Golden Panthers, Amanda pitched in 35 games and allowed a remarkable 1.06 ERA, while winning 12 games and striking out 76 batters. Her statistics have since improved every year, and so came the records.

The accomplishments were, however, of little surprise. Prior to attending FIU she was named the Everett Herald Player of the Year as a senior in high school. She was an All-Wesco County (Washington) pitcher all four years at Jackson High School. She recorded over 800 strikeouts and averaged 22 wins with a 0.51 ERA during her high school career.

Amanda currently holds FIU's all-time wins record with 55, all-time strikeouts with 549, 14 total shutouts and 607.9 innings pitched and still counting.  

"We expect Amanda to do a lot and she just exceeds our expectations. Amanda is a big time pitcher, who always wants the ball in her hand with the game on the line," Gwydir said.

So, with all the accolades, with all the honors and accomplishments, Amanda does not take time out to reflect on her personal achievements. Instead, she is focused on the tasks at hand. At this moment, it is all about reaching the Regionals and advancing in the tournament.

"In her senior year, we look for her to lead us to one of the few accolades that has eluded her thus far, and that is a Sun Belt Conference championship," Gwydir said.

Nealer is very confident about this year's team and feels that it is the best team that she's played on while at FIU, despite the fact that she has played on teams with better talent and more physical ability. 

"This is the first team in FIU history, I think, where we're all friends. There's no cliques, and people just get along. This year's chemistry is perfect and the talent is awesome," Nealer said.

This is a key factor for a team that  plays multiple games per day and up to six games during weekend tournaments, in addition to the single games played during the week. As for the vast number of games played, Nealer has no complaints.

"I absolutely love it. When I was younger, I used to pitch five games in one day. So, pitching four or five games during a weekend is nothing for me. I never want to come off the field," Amanda explains.

The Golden Panthers have 13 games remaining in the regular season before heading into the Sun-Belt Conference Tournament, which will be held in Western Kentucky, May 12-14.

Headline: HANGING UP
Subheadline: A Solution to the Cell Phone Disease
Author: Danny Muela / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Since the dawn of time, annoying things have come and gone. 

The Church of England, the Black Plague, Robert E. Lee and Pauley Shore are all examples of annoying things that have driven the citizens of this planet to either hang themselves or inexplicably turn to religion. 

The latest annoyance to wander into popular culture is just about as irritating as Pauley Shore's long list of tear-inducing movies. It is, of course, the cell phone.

At this point you must be asking yourself how something this widespread can be contained and controlled. 

The solution I have for the cell phone problem is simple. First, every existing cell phone should be deactivated by its respective company. 

At this point every cell phone customer will be issued a brand new phone that comes with a small chip inside the earpiece. 

This magnificent chip ensures that all cell phone nuisances - like over the top ring tones such as the theme from "Three's Company" or totally inane conversations about chicken steak and whether it is actually made of cows or poultry - stopped at once.

Everyone is familiar with the concept of "minutes," right? The consequence of prattling on and on when using a cell phone is that you may go over your minutes and have to pay more. 

Well the E-Chip, as I call it, ups the ante. When you reach the end of your allotted minutes, the E-Chip gives the cell phone user an electrical surge powerful enough to stun a jackrabbit or medium-sized dog. 

The more someone goes over their minutes, the bigger the shock. 

This will cut annoying small talk substantially, and if someone is foolish enough to continue violating the minutes rule, well let's just say that one less inconsiderate person is walking the streets and one more patient is added to the coma ward in a hospital. 

Now you may wonder about those certain individuals who insist on keeping their cell phones on in public places. My solution for that is a bit different. For those extra special offenders, I have come up with another chip called the A-Chip. 

This chip recognizes when it is in a "noise-free" zone such as a classroom or movie theater. The A-Chip notes three separate instances when the cell phone rings. 

On the third time a very small yet powerful explosion goes off killing the cell phone user and anyone unlucky enough to be within two feet of the cell phone user. Collateral damage is not what's important here - it's results.

Many may believe these methods to be harsh. But I think cell phones are evil, and anyone who uses them improperly deserves punishment. 

When I pay $7 to see the new Olsen twins' movie, I want to enjoy their hijinks. Sure, a small explosion may occur, but being a male I don't mind an explosion or two.

For those who think that this will just stop people from getting cell phones, you are wrong because these cell phones will still be trendy and cool-looking. 

They will be up-to-date with the latest styles, like neon green casing and custom touch-tones, because I know that the death machine I carry in my pocket has to look cutting edge, if anything. 

Rest assured, your cell phone will still look cool until the crime scene investigator removes it from the burning crater it leaves in the back of the Cineplex.

Headline: DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE
Subheadline: The struggle to keep Broadcast news fair and balanced
Author: Jamie Blanco / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I don't need spice with my news - or drama. I don't need to be reassured into false securities. I don't care about Michael Jackson, and I don't need to hear how great my country is anymore. 

I just want my news back. 

"Truth is our ultimate goal," declares the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics (SPJCE). 

To strive to present broadcast news material in a way that is objective, accurate and fair is another goal. 

Yet, according to the Washington Post and TruthOut.org, last week the Government Accountability Office declared several federal agencies to be dispensing "illegal propaganda" in the form of prepackaged news stories to TV stations without disclosing the government's role in producing them. 

The Bush administration disagreed with the ruling.

It also did not feel it was unethical to pay African-American journalist, Armstrong Williams, $240,000 in 2004 from the Department of Education funds to advertise the "No Child Left Behind" act to African American audiences on television. 

"Granted every administration seeks to spin the truth," said Miami Herald commentator Leonard Pitts Jr. in an article o Jan. 11, 2005. "But has any worked quite so energetically to propagandize the people, to subvert their right to know? If so it's news to me."

The foundations for a great democracy are built on the decision-making power of the people. 

Thus, it is the greatest single responsibility of a professional journalist to ensure that the public is well informed and is provided with the most direct and concise information available. 

It should come as a comfort then that Fox News, a 24-hour news network, advertises itself as just that: "Fair and Balanced News." 

Why then am I left roused and restless? Perhaps it's because this slogan is less of a sign of dedication to a code of ethics than it is an ingenious marketing ploy.

Rupert Murdock founded the Fox News Network on the conviction that most TV journalists are far more liberal than the population as a whole. 

Running a network on such principles reassures me only of the networks intent to make news reporting fair for conservative viewers. 

Roger Ailes, Fox News Network's current CEO and chairman helped develop Fox news from its infancy to the powerhouse network we know today. But maybe I was wrong about the conservative thing. Maybe I was overreacting. 

It was just after the invasion of Iraq that I sat and watched "Hannity and Colmes," one of the top rated news programs in the nation. 

They brought on CIA officer Larry Johnson. He expressed his concerns about waging two wars (Afghanistan and Iraq) simultaneously and the problems it could create by diverting resources and men. 

He was suddenly interrupted by Sean Hannity, a journalist with no military connections, who proceeded to lecture the CIA officer on how "we do have the ability and resources" to wage both wars and win. 

This clip can be seen in the documentary "OutFoxed."

It was not a question or speculation. It was a declaration in direct contradiction to the concerns of an informed, reputable government officer. Why would a journalist attack his interviewee in this way? 

Once again, in the words of Leonard Pitts Jr. in another article on May 2, 2003, "Such behavior suggests not strength of conviction, but fear of contradiction and terror of competing perspectives." 

An independent study done by FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting) examined the guests that appeared on the nations most prestigious news program, "Fox's Special Report with Brit Hume," over a period of 25 weeks. 

They found that 72 percent of partisan guests were conservative while 15 percent were centrist and 14 percent were progressive. (Information can be found at http://www.fair.org).

The dangers of misinformation from such tactics are grave. A 2003 poll conducted by PIPA/Knowledge Networks, found that the more you watch Fox News, the more likely you are to have false conceptions about important issues, especially in foreign affairs. 

For instance, when asked if world opinion favored the United States Invasion of Iraq, 5 percent of Public Broadcasting Service viewers said yes, whereas 35 percent of Fox viewers answered yes.

When asked if the United States found a link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda, 16 percent of PBS viewers said yes, while an incredible 67 percent of Fox viewers believed the link exists. 

With such disproportionate numbers there has to be some truth to the existence of conservative propaganda circulating through the Fox News Network. 

What else could allow such a large number of viewers of the most popular news network to be blind to simple truths? 

Such misinformation undermines democracy and allow viewers to favor political ideologies based on false truths.

It is perhaps the greatest kind of betrayal to any notable news follower. 

I don't deny that Americans are capable of making their own decisions, but when the path is murky it's easy to get lost.  

Sweeping changes are silently being made today that can revoke our rights and diminish the strength of the system of checks and balances that make this nation great. 

Quietly a bill is being pushed through our congress dubbed Patriot Act II. 

It's a frightening piece of legislation. 

"Until now, in our law, an American could only lose his or her citizenship by declaring a clear intent to abandon it. But -- and read this carefully from the new bill -- 'the intent to relinquish nationality need not be manifested in words, but can be inferred from conduct,'" said the Electronic Frontier Foundation. 

"Legal permanent residents could be deported instantaneously, without a criminal charge or even evidence, if the attorney general considers them a threat to national security." 

I haven't heard this on the news, have you?
