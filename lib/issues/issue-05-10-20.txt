Headline: Football team's loss not disheartening
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
After three years of covering FIU football, I have witnessed some very disheartening defeats, which includes blowing leads of 17 and 24 points against some very good teams. However, the 13-10 loss to North Texas on Oct. 15, was not disheartening, despite the small three-point deficit. 

Despite missing a 41 yard field goal - that would have tied the game with 1:14 left in the game - the loss was not disheartening.

Despite leading 10-6 at halftime and all the way until 1:59 left in the third quarter, the loss was not disheartening.

Despite a stellar performance by a Golden Panther defense which coming into the game was allowing 52.3 points per game to Division I-A programs, the loss was not disheartening.

Despite being so close to the first victory against a Division I-A team, the loss was not disheartening.

Despite being within reach of defeating four-time defending Sun Belt Conference champions, North Texas, the loss was not disheartening.

The loss was not disheartening because the Golden Panthers were not meant to win the game.

A team that commits eight turnovers is not supposed to be anywhere near the other team in point differential, much less a victory.

When running back Adam Gorman fumbled the opening kickoff, it should have hinted at what was to come - a nightmare day - for a team who constantly hurts itself in ballgames.

In total, the Golden Panthers set a school record for fumbles lost (six), while quarterback Josh Padrick threw two interceptions.

"Obviously you can't win the game with turnovers and we certainly had our share," said head coach Don Strock, after the game. "It's a mystery to be honest with you. These are the same drills we have worked on every day. You can't turn the ball over [eight] times."

Strock put it best. I can say this game was lost before it even begun, but that is not the case. It's hard to believe FIU led most of the game and had a chance to tie the game at the end, even with the eight turnovers.

When the season began, Strock said there were no more excuses this season. He talked about how his team has plenty of seniors and "inexperience" was no longer an ordeal to talk about.

While Strock has kept his word and has not used any excuses, his team continues to make the "inexperience" mistakes. When you lose the football six times, a team is clearly not at the level they should be.

The university set a record, by being the fastest football program to reach Division I-A status. However, if the team continues to lose to schools in this division, one has to question if the move was made too quickly.

Blowout losses, to Texas Tech and division foe Arkansas State, clearly states the team has trouble competing against quality opponents. While the team did put up a decent performance against Kansas State, in front of a home crowd against UNT they struggled.

If the team wants students to come out and show their suport, then the program needs to start winning. There was an announced paid attendance crowd of 14,433, but it seemed more like 1,433 in the stadium. The big numbers may sound nice, but fans in attendance know people are not attending games.

There are six games left this season, three of which will be played at home. If the Golden Panthers do not win four of the six games (which is highly unlikely), the team will once again finish below .500. This means a fourth straight losing season.

Subheadline: Golden Panthers VS Troy Trojans
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
When: Oct. 20 at 7:30 p.m.
Where: Davis Field House, Troy, Ala.
TV: ESPNU
Radio: WKAT 1360 AM, WRGP 88.1 FM 
Record: FIU 1-4 (0-2 SBC), TSU 2-4 (1-1 SBC) 

On offense, The Golden Panthers have not improved their redzone production and actually showed recession in their progress after committing eight turnovers against North Texas. The team must begin to score points and reduce costly turnovers. FIU has to be able to take advantage of a defense that allowed 27 points and 355 yards of offense last weekend.

On Defense, FIU must stay with the game plan they had against North Texas. After struggling against Division I-A teams this year, the defense was the only reason the team had a shot at a tie with 1:14 left in the game against UNT. If the defense can play like this consistently, they have a shot to win every game.

Headline: Carolina clashes will decide FIU conference fate
Author: Joshua Ray / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Prior to the start of Conference USA play this season, men's soccer head coach Karl Kremser revealed his goal for the team.

"I'll be very happy to finish in the top-four," Kremser said, "which qualifies us for a home seed in the conference tournament."

After tying Tulsa 1-1 Oct. 14, and losing to Southern Methodist 4-0 two days later, FIU finds itself on the edge of missing its goal. The Golden Panthers now stand at 6-4-2 on the season and 2-1-2 in C-USA, dropping them to fourth place in conference standings with four games remaining. 

FIU plays its final home games of the regular season against South Carolina Oct. 21 and East Carolina Oct. 23. If the Golden Panthers are to play again at the University Park campus this season, they will need to defend their home field against both Carolina schools.

"We're going to have to win this weekend," Kremser said. "South Carolina and East Carolina are critical."



FIU 1, Tulsa 1



FIU had to work very hard to even the score against the Golden Hurricane last Friday night. Tulsa's Lawson Vaughn broke open a scoreless game with a goal at 57:09, shooting the ball on a line into the left side of the net from 25 yards out.

Time ticked away as FIU attempted to mount a desperate comeback. Finally, with less than seven minutes remaining, freshman Judah Hernandez took control of the team's destiny.

Gliding down the sideline through a group of Tulsa defenders, Hernandez fired a shot from the left side of the green into the right side of the net. It was Hernandez's second goal of the season.

Golden Panther goalkeeper Shawn Crowe kept FIU in the game defensively, earning a career-high nine saves. Following Hernandez's goal, Tulsa put on an offensive attack but Crowe was up to the challenge, making three game-saving saves in the first overtime period.

"We did rescue a tie and Shawn Crowe played very well," Kremser said. "But overall I thought it wasn't a very good performance."



SMU 4, FIU 0



FIU earned a 1-1 tie at Tulsa, but their road woes returned at SMU Oct. 16. Four different Mustangs scored and goalkeeper Matt Wideman earned his first career shutout as SMU improved to 6-0 in C-USA. 

"We actually weren't doing too badly in the beginning, but again, it was a disjointed effort," Kremser said. "I'm not insinuating our kids didn't work hard, but they worked hard individually."

Senior Lucas Scudeler led FIU with three shots. The Golden Panthers' leading scorer, senior forward Carron Williams, was held without a shot. 

FIU's 4-0 defeat marked the third time the team has been shutout in 2005. All three of those losses came on the road.

"It just seems like we've got two distinct personalities on this team," Kremser said. "It's almost like a Jekyll and Hyde. We've played very well at home and - with the exception of the first game of the year - we've done abysmally on the road."

All is not lost for the Golden Panthers as the team still controls its own destiny in its quest to host a first-round C-USA playoff game. It will not be easy however, as FIU's next opponent, South Carolina, owns a five-game winning streak in the series. 

"It's going to take probably our best effort of the year to beat South Carolina," Kremser said. "Because we haven't been very successful against them."

The Golden Panthers host the Gamecocks Oct. 21 at 8:15 p.m. In a pre-game ceremony, FIU will celebrate Seniors Night by honoring Scudeler, Williams and the team's five other seniors. 

FIU will then play winless East Carolina Oct. 23 at 2:30 p.m. in the final home game of the regular season. Students get free admission by presenting their PantherCard outside the soccer stadium before game time.

Headline: Volleyball sweeps consecutively at home
Author: Joshua Ray / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Practice made perfect for the volleyball team Oct. 14 and 16 at the Pharmed Arena, as the Golden Panthers defeated South Alabama and Troy in back-to-back sweeps. 

After a 1-4 stretch on the road, an energetic squad showed great teamwork, improving its record to 12-9 (3-4 in the Sun Belt Conference).

"We had a good week of practice," said head coach Danijela Tomic. "That's our philosophy. We have to practice hard if we want to play hard and that's what they did, so I'm very proud of them."

FIU is now 5-0 at the Pharmed Arena this season, with six home games remaining on the schedule.

"Our big goal is to be undefeated at home," said sophomore Alyse Santisi. "We want to kick butt here."



FIU 3, South Alabama 0



FIU routed South Alabama 30-20, 30-25 and 30-18 Oct. 14 to record its second SBC victory of the season.

The Golden Panthers jumped out to a 15-8 lead in the first game on the aggressive play of senior Anna Dmowska, whose spike into the face of Whitney Sanders on the sixth point brought fans to their feet.

"It feels amazing," Dmowska said, happy to be back at home after three weeks on the road. "It's so much better and easier to play with our crowd. It really helps."

The Jaguars cut FIU's lead to 20-17 before a kill by sophomore Mina Spasojevic helped FIU get back on track. Middle blocker Anita Szymanska hit a clean ace on game point to claim the early advantage for FIU.

Szymanska continued her stellar play in the second game, guiding the Golden Panthers to a 16-6 lead with three aces and a kill during a 6-0 run.  

"Always, when you make points for your team, from aces or from kills, it's an unbelievable feeling," said Szymanska, who added a kill at 29-25 to win the second game for FIU. "You give everything from yourself to your players and it's the best feeling."

The stellar serving of outside hitter Mariana Drumeva helped FIU attain a 9-2 third-game lead, and the team never looked back. 

"It's hard to play catch-up games, so we should start every time from the beginning," said Drumeva, who finished with a career-high six service aces. 

Spasojevic showed great versatility in giving FIU a 23-14 lead, guiding the ball over the Jaguars' defensive front line with the softest of touches. Four Jaguars dove, but none connected with the ball, as Spasojevic earned the unlikeliest of kills.

"It's such a great feeling when you hit the balls during the whole game and then you tip one ball and everybody is down on the floor," Spasojevic said. 

A service winner by Drumeva sealed the match victory for the Golden Panthers. 

Setter Whitney Kenney led FIU with 41 assists while Dmowska finished with a match-high 14 kills, impressing Tomic with her improved play.

"Two weeks ago, [Anna] wasn't playing her game," Tomic said. "She came back and she's playing like a leader and I'm really happy for her. I knew that she had the ability; it was just a matter of time."



FIU 3, Troy 0



Dmowska picked up right where she left off against South Alabama, earning 19 kills in the Golden Panthers' 30-26, 31-29, 30-21 defeat of Troy Oct. 16. 

With FIU leading 6-5 in the opening game, Kenney sprinted into the FIU bench to save a ball and Dmowska finished the point with a kill. The Golden Panthers went on a 10-3 run from there, behind the servings of Drumeva and Spasojevic.

On game point, Dmowska spiked the ball into Troy's Bridget Reidy. As the ball bounced off a helpless Reidy and back over the net, Dmowska leaped up for another strong spike, this time putting the ball into the ground and giving FIU the game.

"It feels good," Dmowska said. "I need to work harder on it though."

FIU struggled at the start of the second game, making unforced errors and misreading serves by Troy, which often landed close to the net. Down 23-16, Tomic called a timeout to regroup her players.

The Golden Panthers came out of the timeout looking like the women who played the first game. Back-to-back kills by sophomore Szymanska capped an 8-1 run and tied the score at 24. 

Troy held a game point at 29-28 when Szymanska unleashed the most important of her 12 kills. On a perfect set by Kenney, Szymanska leaped into the air and spiked away Troy's chance to even the match. 

"In my head was only, 'Don't be afraid, just hit the ball,'" Szymanska said. "And I did it. It felt really good."

The Golden Panthers won the next two points to clinch a two-game lead and finish an improbable comeback.

"It was amazing," Szymanska said. "We don't like to play catch-up games; it's always better to put the pressure on the other team from the beginning. But then we started winning rallies and it went on and on, on our side."

FIU broke open a 7-7 tie in the third game with a 19-7 run, capped off by the most memorable point of the weekend. As the two teams rallied for what seemed like minutes, Drumeva made two phenomenal digs with the ball merely inches away from the ground.

"That was incredible. I couldn't believe that was me," Drumeva said, laughing. "After that I was like 'wow.'"

On the same point, libero Alyse Santisi made a diving save before Dmowska put an end to the exchange with a kill.

 "I was thinking 'Please kill the ball Anna' because it was such a long rally," Santisi said. "So I wanted to finish the play, which she did."

FIU went on to win the third game 30-21 and complete the sweep of Troy. 

"It's a great feeling always when you put a team down in three," Szymanska said. "You feel like somebody powerful, like you can move mountains."

Headline: Fumble Woes
Subheadline: Team commits eight turnovers in loss to Sun Belt champions  
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers were so close to winning their first Sun Belt and Division I-A game, they could taste it. However, turnovers, most notably fumbles, made the difference. 

FIU (1-4, 0-2 SBC) fell 13-10 to North Texas (2-3, 2-1 SBC) on Oct. 15 at FIU Stadium in front of a miniscule crowd driven away by the thought of rain and excited only by the presence of a streaker at the start of the second half.

The hosts turned the ball over, a school record eight times, including losing a school record, six fumbles on their way to their first loss against four-time defending conference champions North Texas. 

After the game, head coach Don Strock had no doubt what had gone wrong. 

"Obviously, you can't win any game when you commit turnovers, and we certainly had our share. It's a mystery. These are the same drills we work on every day. You just can't turn the ball over eight times. Last time we turned the ball over that many times we had the same outcome. Whether you lose by one point, three points or 30 points, you can't do that. We'll take a look at the film and go from there," Strock said.

Regardless of the turnovers, the defense kept the team in the game and set up a game tying field goal from kicker Adam Moss with 1:12 left in the fourth quarter. 

Moss pushed the attempt wide left from 41 yards out, handing the Golden Panthers their fourth loss of the season. 

"We have great confidence in our kicker," Strock said. "It's not like he can't kick a 40-yard field goal. This one he didn't make. There were other opportunities, I'm not placing the blame on one guy, there's enough to go around for everybody."

The FIU defense held the offense in the game, allowing the visitors just 226 yards, 79 of which came by way of the air, and 1-of-14 on third down conversion. 

"Our defense played very well tonight,"  Strock said. "We put them in some bad situations and held up against an excellent running attack. North Texas probably has the best running game we are going to face this year."

Gerrod Bodie and Keyonvis Bouie led the way with eight and nine tackles respectively. 

Antwan Barnes, once again getting the start at defensive end, recorded a sack, forced a fumble, got a fumble recovery and had six tackles while disrupting the Mean Green passing attack all game.

FIU controlled the two headed rushing-attack monster of Patrick Cobbs and Jamarion Thomas, the two leading rushers in the country over the last two seasons, holding them to 128 and 32 yards respectively on a combined 34 carries; most of which was contained inside the tackles for short gains.  

Josh Padrick completed 20-of-32 passes for 243 yards and a touchdown, the majority of which came in the first half, but his two costly interceptions and a fumble, coupled with fumbles both by the offense and special teams cost the squad dearly. 

Julian Reams, making a comeback from injury and replacing fellow running back Ben West who was suspended indefinitely by the team prior to the game for a violation of team rules, gained 78 yards on 15 carries; most of which came as he held the offense in the game in the fourth quarter. 

Samuel Smith caught nine passes for 98 yards for a Golden Panther receiving core that was plagued by dropped balls and highlighted by a 2-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter. 



In control early



FIU was in control of the visiting Mean Green early in the game, despite having their first turnover on their first play from scrimmage. 

Tailback Adam Gorman took the hand-off from Padrick and coughed up the football at the FIU 34 yard line. 

After exchanging possessions, FIU marched down the field on a 13 play, 79 yard drive but were held at the 2-yard line by the Mean Green defense. 

The Golden Panthers struggles in the red zone continued and Adam Moss connected on his seventh field goal on seven tries this season, from 25 yards out; handing the hosts a 3-0 lead. 

Following another defensive stop, a trend that was to be seen all night long, FIU took the ball from the North Texas 31-yard line and capitalized. 

Padrick found Smith in the end zone from 2-yards out and the hosts where in front comfortably 10-0; easily controlling the flow of the game. 

The rest of the day however was not to unfold as planned. 

Following field goals of 20 and 41 yards by North Texas kicker Nick Bazalua, FIU took the lead into the locker room at the break 10-6. 

Padrick finished the half a dominating throwing 12-of-16 for 131 yards and a touchdown,.

North Texas mixed up their defensive package in the second half, and the senior was unable to adjust, completing just 8 of 16 passes for 112 yards and an interception in the second half. 



Turnover prove costly



Although the defense played their best game of the season the offense's five second half turnovers cost them the game. 

It was not until late in the third quarter that FIU would pay dearly for its mistakes. 

Padrick was hit from behind on third and three from the FIU 34 and the ball popped loose. North Texas took over the football at the Golden Panthers 23 yard line and punched the ball into the end zone.

Following two runs by Cobbs that gave the visitors a first and goal from the seven, Mean Green quarterback Daniel Meager found wide out Johnny Quinn from seven yards out to give the visitors their first lead of the night 13-10 with 1:57 left in the third quarter.

FIU fumbled on the ensuing kickoff, the seventh turnover of the night, giving North Texas the ball back at the FIU 27 yard line.

Padrick's third turnover of the day, and the team's eighth, would come with just under seven minutes left in the game. Defensive back Brandon Monroe found himself in the right place at the right time as Padrick threw the ball right at his numbers which he then took the other way. 

Following yet another defensive stop, FIU started their final drive from their own 14 yard line. With just under four minutes left to play, the stars seemed aligned for a late comeback win. 

Padrick completed a 35 yard pass to Chad Williams which gave the Golden Panthers the ball almost at midfield. 

Two plays later, Padrick connected with Smith for a 20 yard completion which put the Golden Panthers at the Mean Green 33 yard line. 

Following a rush by Reams, and incomplete pass, and a five yard completion to Williams, FIU faced a fourth and one from the 24.

Strock decided to leave the game in the hands of his kicker, who had previously been 7-7 of the season, from 41 yards out. 

Moss pushed the ball wide left and the Mean Green rejoiced while many of the Golden Panther fans questioned the decision to not go for it on fourth and one.  

The Golden Panthers will now travel to face Sun Belt Conference leaders Troy in Alabama on Thursday Oct. 20th. The game will be FIU's first televised game of the season, airing on ESPN U at 7:30 pm.

Headline: New gun control law questionable
Author: Jessica Garcia Iñiguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Before Oct. 8, Florida law required that someone under attack must first attempt to flee his or her attacker before being legally allowed to use any form of force. 

However, the new "stand your ground" law, enacted on Oct. 8, changed the rules on self-defense. 

The new law allows for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves or others in life threatening situations without the mandate to "flee first." 

This right  protected people in the privacy of their homes, but the new law extends this right to meet "force with force" at any place one has the legal right to be. 

Chiefly, people no longer need to become victims before using force on an attacker to defend themselves.

Gun control activists (or rather fanatics) have been having a field day since the date. 

The Brady Campaign, an activist group has taken paranoia to a ridiculous level. 

Spearheading the campaign's efforts is Sarah Brady,   wife of former assistant  to President Ronald Reagan, Jim Brady. 

Mr. Brady was among those injured during the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981. While one can sympathize with Brady's experience, that is still no answer for the hysterical display the campaign has put forth in light of the new law. 

The Brady Campaign is handing out pamphlets at Miami and Orlando airports and has placed ads in newspapers around the nation, as well as in some European countries, against the new law. 

The Brady Campaign is targeting tourists with these pamphlets, which read "An Important Notice to Florida Visitors." 

The pamphlet also includes a picture of Florida drawn as a handgun and offers advice on how to stay safe. 

"Do not argue unnecessarily with local people. If someone appears to be angry with you, maintain to the best of your ability a positive attitude and do not shout or make threatening gestures," is just one piece of advice the pamphlet offers to tourists. 

"Visitors should be very careful about getting into an aggressive argument with anyone during their stay,"  Mrs. Brady said in a statement on The Brady Campaign website.  It sounds as if the Brady Campaign is advising tourists to stay away from a barbarian war zone. 

However, Florida is not the place of crazed gun holders as The Brady Campaign is trying to make it out to seem. 

In fact, according to the state's annual crime report, Florida's crime rate is at a 34-year low; much of which the last 10 or so years can be attributed to the Concealed Weapons Act passed during the 1994 -1995 legislative session. 

The "stand your ground" law is not one to increase violence. In fact, it was instilled to protect those who by law are licensed to carry arms. 

By giving law-abiding citizens the right to protect themselves, or others, illegal gun carriers and users are the only ones who need to fear the repercussions of the new law.

FIU students have different opinions on the issue. 

"The law will do more harm than good," said senior Viviana Neder. 

On the other hand, sophomore Albert Marruro disagrees. 

"If someone is threatening you, you should have the right to defend yourself," Marruro said.

Sophomore Miriam Fresco also agrees with the new law. 

"Fleeing from a gun is a bit far fetched. How can you flee when someone has a gun pointed straight at you? I completely support the new law because it allows for innocent people to protect themselves and loved ones," Fresco said.

Whatever your opinion, however, it is all to clear to see that the Brady Campaign is simply manipulating the new law to use it as a scare tactic in hopes to gain support for their campaign. 

To quote Governor Jeb Bush, the Brady Campaign's attempt is "pure, unadulterated politics."

Subheadline: Movie theatre rudeness at all time high
Author: Daniel Carratala / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
We have all been there, it has happened to us before. We go to the movies to catch a flick, yet the entire experience is ruined when a cell phone goes off during the movie. 

Recently, however, the problem has definitely escalated. Before, a cell phone would ring a few times and the owner would quickly silence it. Nowadays, cell phones play music, light up and are louder than ever before. 

As if that is not bad enough, the owner of the cell phone usually takes awhile to acknowledge that it is  ringing and instead of simply turning it off, they take a look at who is calling, determine whether they want to answer it or not and then either pick up or put it away. But wait, there is more. 

With more and more people downloading movies on the Internet or buying bootleg copies, one would think the film industry would lower its prices as an incentive to attract a new generation of moviegoers and retain older, loyal ones. 

What has happened is the exact opposite. Movie theatres have recently jacked up their prices to as much as $10 a ticket. Sunset place 24 and Kendall Village 16 are among the local theatres with the highest ticket prices.

Then there is the problem with stadium seating. Although at first, stadium seating was praised because one could see the screen no matter where on sat, moviegoers failed to realize what would happen behind us. 

This is a problem we have all encountered at one point or another. We go to the movies, have a seat, and shortly into the film, the person sitting behind us decides to mount their feet on top of the chair.

 At first, this action might go unnoticed, however, after a few minutes of restlessness, that person usually decides to put their feet up and down, and up and down leading to a horrible night at the movies. 

If one is lucky enough to go to the movies, get a student discount, have a well-mannered person sit behind him and not have a single cell phone go off, then we have solved everything - right? Wrong. 

The reason people enjoyed going to the movies in the past was because they wanted to stop watching television at home and enjoy a night out. 

Americans can no longer enjoy the thrill of a movie because before the movie even begins, we now have to sit through tons of commercials. When did that become the norm? 

For example, if one were to catch a movie that starts at 12:45, with 20 extra minutes of commercials, followed by 15 minutes of previews and a two hour movie, a moviegoer would be leaving at 3:20 in the morning. It's still not over. 

Then there is that lady - you know - the one who decides to bring her newborn baby to see a 12:55 screening of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose." Minutes into the opening sequence, the baby is  already crying. 

The logical thing to do would be to get up and tend to your child. But no, the lady waits and waits, hoping for her baby to stop crying. 

We know better, however. Five minutes later, after the entire audience witnessed an inaudible scene, due to the baby's crying reaching ten decibels, the lady decides to leave and hopefully never returns. 

It is no wonder why the total number of tickets sold in 2004 drastically fell by 2.5 percent from 2003 and overall is down 7.5 percent since 2002, according to CBS news.

 So now that one realizes the problems and the statistics one is faced with a possible solution? 

Luckily, in addition to the infinite commercials and previews, movie theatres are also reminding moviegoers, more than once in some places, to silence or turn off their cell phones. 

If you do not catch a blockbuster film or decide to catch a movie that has been out for a few weeks, arrive 10 to 20 minutes after the starting time on your ticket. 

You'll arrive just in time for the previews and should not have a problem finding a seat. 

As for the rude people sitting behind you with their legs propped on your seat, simply move or ask them politely, to put their feet down. And as for the lady with the crying baby who never fails to show up pray that she will take a night off.

Headline: FIG increases student comfort
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
As enrollment increases at the Biscayne Bay Campus, a program like the Freshman Interest Groups, which is designed to help freshmen become active on campus and obtain academic success, can help guide through the crowded hallways and in to class on time. 

With a learning environment of 24 students, FIG creates closer relationships with both students and professors, and that means more student involvement and a positive transition to college life, according to Jeffrey Knapp, director of the academy for the art of teaching and the FIG program.

FIU first introduced FIG in 1999, and the number of Fall FIG students who attended the Fall 2000 semester was nine percentage points above the class average, and their grades were higher, according to the official FIU FIG website. Fall FIG students have been similarly successful ever since. 

"We profile students. We always like to report that we have a freshmen average SAT [score] of about 1160," Knapp said. "But this year we've admitted a larger number of students who needed help in math and science."

The program's first-year experience course can also familiarize new students with on-campus organizations.

"A number of students who've taken the course have gone on to become very active at the campus. It's an excellent program," said Brian Haynes, BBC assistant vice-president of student affairs. "FIG students are active on all levels such as Student Government Council, Student Programming Council and Student Organization Council among others."

During the Summer B term, the small group stays together for two or three classes such as: Essay Writing, First-Year Experience, Intro to Psychology, Freshman Composition, or any desired course. 

But in the fall, freshmen take four or five classes together: Freshman Composition, Freshman Experience and classes specifically chosen for the FIG student, usually a science, lab and social science. 

This fall, the program is offered to Summer B students, and in the Spring, they'll have linked courses, to continue the learning community experience. 

"[There are] 24 students in one English class, who go to the same [science class], which has 340 [students]. So [as a result], they'd know 24 students there. They'd then go the lab, which has 24 students, and then  to the math [class], which has about 150 to 200 students. And they'd know 24 students," said Laura McDermot, a graduate assistant for the Academy for the Art of Teaching. 

Most FIG classes for fall freshmen are major-based in order to help students fill their core curriculum requirements, but even if students are undecided or change majors, their FIG credits count. The only exceptions are pre-med students, who may be offered biology for non-science majors. 

With faculty and students working closely together, FIG provides an extra level of personal attention and comfort that freshmen not involved in the program may not get.

"It builds a community because professors have to work together as well," said McDermot.

Nursing major Lauren Passwaters agrees.

"I thought the university would be a lot harder. [FIG] made it very easy for me to get used to college life," Passwaters said.

However, some students, like Tiffany Blagerman, who entered FIU this past summer, still desired more attention.

"I liked that my professors offered office hours, but I disliked the fact that they weren't available all of the time," said Blagerman, a nursing major. "Most of what we learn we are responsible for and the [professor] doesn't often remind us when an assignment may be due."

Other FIG students, like Alaina Bobrowski, a criminal justice and international relations major, found some of her professors difficult. 

"I hated that my math teacher was so horrible. He treated his students with [a] seriously bad attitude, and his professionalism was close to nil," Bobrowski said. 

However, as difficult or unattainable a professor may be, national research shows FIG students are more successful in completing their degrees, according to Knapp.

"The fact is when you're in a university with 35,000 students, you're in classes with 350 students, getting that close support network makes it possible to form study groups,"  Knapp said.

But Bobrowski disagrees. 

"I really didn't like [the program]. I saw the same faces everywhere I went, and its not like we got close and personal like we should have," Bobrowski said. 

While for others, getting a head start has proven to enhance a freshman's first semester at FIU. 

"It was a nice experience because that way it was easier to get to know [people] and make friends," Blagerman said.

Study shows gastric bypass causes death more likely for men, older patients

Data from 16,000 patients with an average age of 48 covered by Medicare showed a higher risk of death by weight loss stomach procedures.

Researchers from the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 7.5 percent of stomach surgeries caused deaths during the first year after surgery.

The research stated that older patients were at a higher risk. Dr. Patricia Byers, director of bariatric surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, hopes the data will not be reason for insurers to not cover procedures.

"I'm just very concerned this data is going to be taken the wrong way," Byers said. "It's a very big operation on very sick people. It needs to be compared to other similar operations, such as a kidney transplant."

Director of bariatric surgery at the University of South Florida and Tampa General Hospital, Dr. Michel Murr, who has studied older patients who had stomach procedures, found a lower complication rate than the JAMA study. 

Murr is willing to testify to insurers before the Florida Senate Health Committee and understands their concerns with the quality of the procedures.

"Not everybody [is allowed to do] liver transplants. We need to concentrate bariatric surgeries in certain centers where we can track the outcomes," Murr said.

Surgical stomach procedures have escalated from an estimate of 13,365 in 1998 to 102,794 in 2003.

FEMA restricts evacuee information

Information on Hurricane Katrina evacuees is restricted by The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is complicating relief efforts from the family of evacuees due to privacy concerns and law enforcement officials searching for parolees and convicted sex offenders. 

FEMA rejected access to information for more than 100,000 evacuees registered for state aid, as well as requests from five states to crosscheck the database of convicted sex offenders and parolees against a list of evacuees who had requested state assistance. 

The federal privacy law is intended to protect people from identity theft. 

However, in light of Hurricane Katrina, state aid officials suggest a balance in the restriction of information. 

FEMA started to take over more shelters to alleviate the financial situation on the state. This is worrisome to families of evacuees who think this might make it even more difficult to get in contact with their families.

Earthquake death toll may reach 100,000

Northern Pakistan relief officials and local government leaders have estimated 100,000 deaths from the Oct. 8 earthquake. 

20 percent of the territory destroyed by the earthquake has yet to receive any food, medical care or shelter. 

According to relief officials, this is due to landslides or high altitude too high for helicopters to operate. 

Humanitarian relief workers warn that several thousand thought to be stranded in mountain villages are at risk of dieing from infections if not treated soon.

Headline: Car accident causes death of student
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
A dedicated athlete and a devout Christian - this is how Michelle Suzette Lavalle was described by volleyball teammates and friends. 

Lavalle was one of eight passengers, set out on a church retreat to Orlando, in a 2005 silver Dodge Durango. 

On Oct. 15, the car flipped three times after the driver fell asleep at the wheel, according to the press release issued by the Florida Highway Patrol. According to the report, Lavalle was ejected and pronounced dead at the scene. 

The accident took place on the Florida Turnpike about 24 miles north of Yeehaw Junction. Out of the eight passengers, six were not wearing seat belts and were ejected out of the vehicle. 

The remaining two who wore seat belts were not ejected and suffered minor injuries.

Lavalle inspired her teammates both off and on the court.

"Michelle was one of the most amazing people I've ever known - an angel, really," said Laura Vogel, a friend of Lavalle and middle blocker for the volleyball team. "Not only was she a dedicated, hard-working volleyball player, playing in pain most of the time, but she was also a loving and caring friend to those who knew her. She was a devout and joyful Christian and was an inspiration to me." 

Lavalle was defense specialist and played during the volleyball team in the 2003 season but sat out with an injury in 2004. 

"Michelle was a wonderful young woman, very committed to FIU and to her team," said Athletic Director Rick Mello. "Our hearts go out to her family."

Kappa Delta Pi, the education honor society Lavalle was a part of, is rasing fundings to send a flower wreath to Lavalle's family. Lavalle was supposed to graduate in December 2005 from the College of Education.

"We are going to raise funds to order her stole and medallion to give to her parents once we get it in," said Natalie Carbonell, president of Kappa Delta Pi. 

At the volleyball game between FIU and Troy Oct. 16, both teams and the fans honored Lavalle's memory with a moment of silence. 

Lavalle was 22-years-old. She went to high school at Barbara Goleman and attended La Roca Firme church in Hialeah.

If anyone would like information about where and when the funeral for Lavalle will take place, Carbonell can be reached at natboop@yahoo.com.

Headline: Homecoming events to highlight previous years
Author: Jessica Ariste / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Homecoming week will take place from Oct. 22-29 and will take FIU students, faculty and staff on a ride back in time.

The theme for homecoming this year is "the evolution of the panther" and will take us back to when FIU first opened its doors. Student Government Association is spending a total of $80,000 on homecoming events. Activities will begin Oct. 22 with Moonlight Madness, a 70s themed pep rally. 

Moonlight Madness will be the kick-off event to Homecoming week - much like a pep rally before the basketball game - and will take place at the Pharmed Arena.   

The activities for Moonlight Madness will include a heat extreme team shoot out competition, a costume contest, an afro contest and a 70s dance off. Hooters will also be providing free food and drinks for those students who attend.

 The celebrations continue with "Wear Your Blue and We'll Feed You." Outback Steakhouse will visit  and feed the first 500 students who show their panther pride by wearing their FIU spirit t-shirts from 12 to 2 p.m.; at the Graham Center Pit, Oct. 24. Following that, students can participate in the Lip Sync Contest at 8 p.m. at the Pharmed Arena where students can karaoke to their favorite 80s tunes. 

The Trivia Show, taking place Oct. 25, will test students' knowledge on FIU and the 90s. Winners will be awarded points for their organization.

The homecoming court will participate in a talent show Oct. 26. There are six ladies and four gentlemen running for homecoming queen and king. Students will be able to vote for their favorites on the following day from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the GC Pit.

At Lot 5, students will be able to watch  "The Fantastic 4" Oct. 28 for Drive-In Movie Night. Another night of homecoming week will be the Pre-Game Block Party, also titled Homecoming Eve.  

Homecoming Eve will include a laser show and music provided by Power 96 WPOW. Blue and gold balloons will drop along with a ball drop, which will occur at midnight. 

A $300 book scholarship, to be used at the campus bookstore, will be given to the person who catches the ticket filled balloon.

Finally, to close the homecoming festivities, Oct. 29, a parade at 2 p.m. will be held. The parade will include State Representative Rene Garcia, who will be the grand marshal. There will also be classic cars provided by Exotic Toys Car Rental, US Army and Fire marshals and President Modesto Maidique.  

"[This is the] first year we are going to have a parade of this magnitude," said Brian Swensen, director of homecoming events.

The parade will start at Tamiami Park and end at Lot 7, where students will be greeted with a concert tailgate party where Vs. the Earth will play their hits.  Students will listen to songs from the 70s, 80s, 90s and today, leading to the homecoming game against Middle Tennessee State, which will begin at 6 p.m. There will be people around the stadium with shirts that say "wave crew" who will start the infamous wave among the fans. 

Two $300 book scholarships will be given away, one at the end of the first quarter and one at the end of the second quarter. 

At half-time, a $900 free meal plan will be given away, and the third quarter will offer a free semester of housing worth $2,500. 

Those that win these prizes must stay until the end of the game in order to claim their prize. Student Government and Student Programing Council hope for a good turnout for the homecoming events.

Headline: Decathlon team finishes strong at competition
Author: Andrew Leins / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Solar Decathlon Team won first place in the energy balance category and thirteenth place overall at The Solar Decathlon in Washington, D.C. 

The competition was to build a home, running completely on solar energy.

Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, the competition included 18 other universities. 

FIU beat out five other schools to take 13 place in the overall competition.

Ironically, in a contest dealing with solar energy, the week-long competition was marred by rain and cloudiness. 

"On the opening day, the rain started and it was rainy and cloudy all week, which was kind of funny," said team leader Robert Perez. 

The rain ended up causing serious problems for the FIU team, as their power reserves weren't charged up enough for them to run many of the household appliances in the house. 

"We hadn't counted on not having sunshine, as we were reassembling the house and putting the finishing touches, we were running a lot of our equipment on the power of the house so our reserves were depleted," Perez said.

Despite this, it led FIU to its first place victory in the energy balance category.

"We simply had to conserve as much power as possible and couldn't run a lot of the appliances, which hurt us in some categories," Perez said.

At one point had as low as 16 volts in its power bank the house, but through creative energy management, the team was able to get the power reserve back up to 46 volts.

"In the end, that's why we won first place in the energy balance category," Perez said.

The "Solar Village" was visited by more than 100,000 people, including government officials. The FIU team was visited by Florida representatives Carrie Meek and Bill Nelson. 

The University of Colorado won the overall first place award for the second consecutive time.

Faculty project leader Yong X. Tao felt the project was a great success. 

"Our team really came through after all the setbacks and unexpected weather conditions. To still win a first place award was really something," Tao said. "The best thing about this competition was it really put FIU on the map." 

The house will be brought back from Washington and remain on the University Park campus as a museum. The Do-It Yourself (DIY) TV network will air a documentary on the competition in December.

Headline: 30 Seconds to Mars gains recognition with new album
Author: Melissa Quincosa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the release of a  second album, A Beautiful Lie, 30 Seconds to Mars has changed its look and is rapidly emerging into the mainstream. 

This might be because of the help of their famous lead vocalist, Jared Leto, who has acted in numerous films including "Fight Club," "Panic Room" and "Requiem For A Dream." Not only does the band have a famous actor as its front man, 30 Seconds to Mars also has three other very talented musicians. 

The band consists of Tomo Milicevic on guitars, Matt Wachter on bass and Shannon Leto on drums. Many critics were quick to judge that the band would not succeed. 

Band members  were challenged to prove they were indeed talented, original and not just using a famous face to win over the industry. A Beautiful Lie proves the band has surpassed those challenges and is on its way to rock 'n' roll victory. The unique sound of 30 Seconds to Mars is a mixture of Pink Floyd and Incubus.

The high-pitched lead vocals and guitar numbers integrate the distinct sounds and reveals the different elements within the musical melodies. Dramatic song titles such as "Kill, Attack, and Hunter" are what many may call melodramatic tunes. 

Songs deal with the trials and tribulations of the band members' past life experiences. 

Leto said to Stereo-Type magazine that the album characterizes the "personal and professional challenges" in their lives. These challenges lead to the emotional transition of songs throughout the album. 

The songs vary at times, from hard, screaming rock to mellow, sweet music; each reflecting the tragedies or happiness of the time. 

Yet, some portions of the songs sound a bit hardcore and over the top. The loud scratchy screams make you want to turn down the volume and take a breath. 

The goal of A Beautiful Lie was about "renewal, regrowth, change, rebirth," said Leto to Stereo-Type magazine. 

The band wanted to change its sound from the first album, which Leto considered "very cerebral and obtuse." Needless to say, the band has decided to promote the new album by touring the United States alongside Audioslave and Seether.

Headline: Hispanic Heritage 2005 ends with a festive bang
Author: Geoffrey Anderson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Before the FIU football game on Oct. 15, the Student Programming Council had its annual Carnaval, a festival marking the end of the organization's Hispanic Heritage 2005 celebration.

From Oct. 3 to Oct. 15, SPC hosted various events across campus to celebrate and observe Hispanic culture. The events ranged from Hispanic dinners to Latin karaoke. 

Carnaval started at 2 p.m. in parking Lot 7, next to the football stadium. After news of free food spread throughout the lot, crowds gathered around the Hispanic Heritage tent to get some of the available food.

Pork, plantains, rice and beans were among the several items served at the event.

"The Hispanic food at the event was absolutely delicious. There were so many trays of rice and beans that I just had to go back to the tent for more helpings," said sophmore Jorge Valens.

To begin the concert portion of the event, Taboo Bambu performed. The Miami-based group mixed pop elements with reggae rhythms and got several audience members dancing. Although the crowd was dispersed throughout Lot 7, many onlookers nodded their heads and swayed to the band's music.

The band performed last year at the Biscayne Bay Campus for the Latin Fusion Explosion concert, an event promoting Hispanic Heritage 2004.

After Taboo Bambu's lively set, audience members were treated to free salsa lessons from Salsa Ardiente, a local dance studio. Many individuals gathered around the stage to take advantage of the free basic dance lessons.

"I'm glad there were salsa lessons at Carnaval because the group environment made me realize that I'm not the only person who can't dance well," said sophmore Luis Alonzo.

SPC members appeared on stage to throw free t-shirts displaying the Spanish word "Caliente," the theme for Hispanic Heritage 2005. Crowd members cheered and jumped wildly to get t-shirts and other giveaways.

The next group to perform was Latin rock band Locos Por Juana. As soon as the band started to play, rain poured down and delayed the group's set. The rain stopped after a few minutes however, and Locos Por Juana resumed playing.

Locos Por Juana's notable blend of Caribbean beats and alternative rock entertained the crowd and the group's energetic vibe could be felt throughout Lot 7.

The Miami-native band has performed at FIU several times this year, including appearances at SPC's Pantherstock and the Student Organization Council's club fair. The band is a 2005 Latin Grammy nominee and has also appeared in various media outlets such as Billboard Magazine and the Miami New Times.

Locos Por Juana's was followed by more salsa lessons.  SPC members continued to throw free t-shirts and beach towels into the audience, while others kept visiting the Hispanic Heritage tent for free food and drinks.

 To finish the concert, headliner Sandy MC gave a spirited performance amidst slight rain that persisted throughout the artist's set. The group's fusion of merengue and rap filled Lot 7 with intense beats and vocals. 

The three group members danced and sang enthusiastically as the crowd swayed in front of the stage. Four girls from the audience appeared on stage to dance alongside the group members and received several cheers from onlookers.

Despite slight setbacks from the constant rain, Carnaval provided students and visitors with a greater appreciation for Latin culture.

Micaela Ancewicz, SPC Hispanic Heritage chair, believes the event was successful.

"Everything that the committee planned for the event happened and the only problem we faced was the rain, which was beyond our control. Overall, the event was a success," Ancewicz said.

Headline: Fashion Week hits the beach
Author: Melissa Quincosa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Taking place at the Paris Studios on 550 and Washington Ave., in Miami Beach, and running from Oct. 11 to 15, Fashion Week Miami brought together designers from all across the United States to promote their new lines and demonstrate passion for fashion.

The purpose for this week was to showcase the new Spring/Summer lines for the 2006 collections, as well as to give emerging fashioners the ability to make a name for themselves. 

Each designer used distinct fabrics and accessories to accentuate their collections. Some were outrages, while others were dull and dim. Baby Phat livened up the crowd with their mixture of urban hip-hop clothing and music. Melissa Suarez, an avid fashion show attendant, said she loved the collection and the music really got her on her feet. 

Not only does clothing play a role in a fashion show, but the music really calls attention to the catwalk.Through each designer's unique fashion sense, the crowd got a sense of the creators personality and a brief description of what his or hers collection had to offer. 

Overall, each designer presented a quality of craftsmanship and dedication through each piece that was presented. 

The designers showed ownership of the runway and really demanded the attention that they deserved. The models used their long legs and slow walks in order to call attention to the collections. These companies also added to their wardrobes by having beautiful models, both male and female, on hand to show off their work.

Designers also obtained maximum exposure from various media outlets. Such outlets included Maxim and MTV, which there to catch a glimpse of the newest collections. Not to mention, designers also had the ability to appeal to buyers for their products.

The Paris Studio, which is also a theater and a 1940'S landmark, was transformed into a hip and stylish facility with various plasma screens along the studio, different colored flashing lights, speakers booming loud music and a very long and white runway. All these aspects gave the three-story building new life and definitely a new state-of-the-art look. 

The theme of the week was Funkshion Miami, and the "Funk" is exactly what it was all about. The different designs and various art works showed off a new deco look for fashion and emerging talent in the industry.

Luli Fama, a Miami-based company, was also at hand to promote its new swim wear collection. This collection showed a Latin flair on the runway with inspired looks and rich colors derived from South America. 

"Luli Fama prides on making a girl a star on the beach," said Lourdes Hanimian, designer and owner of Luli Fama Swim. 

This independent bathing suit company shows a lot of talent and great star quality for the future.

Designers such as Baby Phat, Dusica Dusica, Theresa Turchin and DKNY were all distinct and showed their knack for fashion with their Spring/Summer 2006 collection.

Fashion Week Miami was a true success at bringing new ,emerging and famous talented designers together to share the same desire through their collections and their goal to promote upcoming lines.

   The Step Show   Friday October 21st, 2005

  To start, I never experienced security at its' worst. The security was so "Ghetto" and nasty. Volunteers from the Student Life Office volunteered to help the control of the general public. As the volunteers changed into their "Staff" shirts, they transformed into "Wannabe" cops. They yelled and used foul language. I never thought that a "Staff" shirt would make such a transformation. In addition, the person who was in charge was so rude. It was out of control. Six officers was on scene. I felt as if the monkeys got loose from the local zoo.  Who whould expect such an outcome? 
Students can not be in charge of handling such events. From my experience, I would never attend any kind of event of such nature. - SJMC Student

Hello. My name is Victoria Roman. I mailed in an application over 2 months ago. The turnaround was quick. I received a response and turned it down due not getting paid for the 1st six assignments. (To see what I am capable of doing). I have been taking pictures for nearly 7 years. I worked on "Motion Picture" movie sets, and a few small celebrities. I have an extensive portfolio (which was "NOT" viewed). I am insulted. In addition, I am a Graphic Designer. I have alot to contribute being that I am pretty well-established and self-employed.
I have done alot, being that I am only 21. The rule "...The 1st six assignments are not paid" should not apply to everyone. Whoever applies for a position should be evaluated individually". I am dedicated to my line of work and I do not mind sharing my talent or experience w/ others. I will be following up with this letter. Thank you.
