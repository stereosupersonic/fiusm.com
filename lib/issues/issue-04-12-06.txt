Headline: Up tempo play lifts women's basketball
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After dropping the championship game against West Virginia in the FIU/Herald Thanksgiving Classic, the women's basketball team wanted to get back on the winning column against Fordham on Dec 1. 

Led by Milena Tomova's 20 points and 14 rebounds, the Golden Panthers defeated Fordham 61-52 at Pharmed Arena. 

With this victory, FIU improved to a 3-2 on the season.

Early in the game, it was an up-and-down battle between the two teams. 

Fordham evenly matched every FIU attack and countered nicely by shooting mid-range shots.  

Well-executed fast breaks and a successful transition game proved to  make the difference that night.  

Just eight minutes into the game, Fordham had committed five fouls and eventually went over the limit with 8:30 left in the first half.

The Golden Panthers outscored the Rams from the charity stripe 14 to seven and committed fewer than nine fouls.  

Head coach Cindy Russo raved about her team's ability to penetrate and get high percentage lay-ups.

"We played really well against a good team," Russo said. "We played really hard and were able to utilize our biggest strength, which is the transition game."

Transition surely was the word of the game as the FIU outscored Fordham fourteen to zero on fast breaks.

After a rollercoaster-like first half, the Golden Panthers started off the second half with an astonishing 12-2 run that opened the gap and paved way for their victory.

"Fordham seemed to be really tired after the first half," Russo said. "I just told them to keep running the ball, and we would get our way."

 With the help of bench sparkplug LaQuetta Ferguson, point guard Faeza Bouderra ran up tempo game and had the Rams on their toes throughout the game.

"[Fordham University] got into foul trouble quickly, and I just wanted to penetrate the ball," said Bouderra. "They put a lot of pressure on us, but we were able to grab rebounds and keep [the pace of the game] up."

Going into the game, Bouderra was averaging just over six points, six rebounds and nearly seven assists per game. 

Bourderra nearly doubled her scoring performance and did statistically better in the other categories as the 5'5 guard hoisted a solid 12 points,   eight assists and eight rebounds in the game.  

Playing all 40 minutes proved to be no problem for Bouderra of Mulhouse, France, as she was able to play solid defense on speedy guard Monica Mack and distribute the ball well to her teammates.  

After the game, Bouderra was proud of the way her team got back on the winning column.

"We out rebounded [Fordham University] and that was the key to the game," said Bouderra. "I feel [as] if we ran the clock well and just played a much smarter game."

Tomova recorded her second double-double in three games. The senior student liked the way FIU outplayed the Rams with an up tempo-style.

"We played very good defense against a tough team," Tomova said. "We ran a lot of fast breaks and penetrated the ball very well."

With four blocks on the day, Tomova passed Teresa Reker for fourth place on the all-time list with 102. She is now behind Albena Branzova (252), Cormisha Cotton (142), and Silvia Mesa (107).

Coach Russo tweaked the lineup and gave sophomore Lasma Jekabsone the nod to start at center.  

Playing a season high of 30 minutes, the player from Latvia scored six points in the first two minutes of the second half.

This victory was a much needed one for FIU, as the team will face a tough University of Miami squad on Dec. 9 at Pharmed Arena. The game can be heard live on the radio on WRGP 88.1 FM.

Headline: UCONN routs Golden Panthers
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU found out the hard way why the University of Connecticut Huskies are ranked No. 7 in the country.

After FIU took a quick 2-0 lead, thanks to a Byron Burnett dunk at the start of the game, UCONN coach Jim Calhoun called a quick timeout just nine seconds into the game. 

After play resumed, the defending national champions put on a show, and sent FIU in a rout.

In front of a sellout crowd of 10,167 at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion, UCONN humiliated the Golden Panthers, essentially blocking a school-record 19 shots, en route to a 99-48 victory on Nov. 30.

Junior guard Rashad Anderson from Lakeland, FLA, led the Big East Champion Huskies with 17 points. Meanwhile, big man and all-America candidate, Josh Boone, added his second double-double in as many games with 14 points and 11 rebounds. He and Anderson both added four blocks a piece. 

The Huskies had four men in double figures as FIU lost for the second time this season, dropping the Golden Panthers record to 3-2. 

6'9 freshmen standout Rudy Gay added 12 points and eight rebounds, while forward Denham Brown added 13 for UCONN. 

The Huskies shot 35 of 74 from the floor, including 21-40 in the first half, as they bolted to a 55-23 halftime lead. UCONN converted 9 of 19 chances from behind the arc to include shooting a blistering 8 of 14 in the first period. 

"After about five, six, seven minutes, we just took the starch out of them and just pounded the ball inside," Calhoun in a UCONN press release. "Then they decided to go zone after we got the ball inside, and we buried our first eight of 10 or 11 threes, and the game was basically over by that time."

Two players in double figures, Juniors Ivan Almonte and Ismael N'Diaye, led FIU. Both newcomers notched 12 points in the loss.

Golden Panther leading scorer Junior Matias was held in check by the Huskies. The fifth year senior shot ice cold, going 2 of 13 from the field and 1 of 6 from downtown, limiting him to a season low five points in 18 minutes of play. 

The story of the night, for the out- classed Golden Panthers, had to be that they could not maintain possession of the ball. With 26 turnovers, the speedy Huskies siezed opportunities and converted them into 26 points. 

FIU, clearly the underdog, was out played as UCONN captured more rebounds than FIU by 21, 57-36. The Golden Panthers have up 19 offensive boards. 

FIU once again settled for outside shots that didn't fall, putting up 14 three point attempts and converting only two; one in each half. 

The Huskies reached the free throw line 30 times, 23 of which came in the second half. FIU was 8 of 14 from the stripe. 

Connecticut had just returned from a four game exhibition trip to England, in which they finished 3-1 against four professional British teams. 

The next home game at Pharmed Arena is on Dec. 9 against cross-town rival, the Miami Hurricanes.

Headline: Déjà vu?
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The 1983 NFL and 1984 NBA draft classes are often remembered as two classes that shaped their respective sport. Many current and future Hall of Fame players emerged from each class. Now, 20 years later, both professional leagues are witnessing a class that looks as solid as those of '83 and '84.


Every now and then a draft class enters a professional sports league with such a flood of talent that the future of the sport is forged within a year. 

The 1983 NFL draft, for example, introduced John Elway, Dan Marino, Jim Kelly, Erick Dickerson, Darrel Green and several other Hall of Fame players who rewrote the record books and changed the face of football through the mid 90s. 

Only a year later, the 1984 NBA draft spawned the Hall of Fame careers of Hakeem (The Dream) Olajuwon, (Sir) Charles Barkley, John Stockton and Michael Jordan, who won six NBA championships, five MVP awards and ten scoring titles.

Not since then has the NFL or NBA had an abundance of talent enter the pro ranks in consecutive years. But while the 2003 NBA and 2004 NFL drafts still have a lot to prove, they look to be the most comparable to those of 20 years ago.

Last season's NBA draft launched the careers of Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Darko Milicic and Chris Bosh. These players are expected to be the face of the NBA for the next 10 years. 

This year, the NFL unleashed Ben Roethlisberger, Eli Manning, Sean Taylor, Larry Fitzgerald and Kellen Winslow Jr., to name a few. 

At the head of their respective classes are James and Roethlisberger. Sure, it's too early to tell if either will develop to their full potential, but both are off to a spectacular start and resemble two of the greatest players in professional sports.

The other number 23, James, drew immediate comparison to his 1984 counterpart, Michael Jordan.

 James has been called the next Jordan since his St. Vincent and St. Mary High School games earned him national recognition on ESPN. 

Never before has an athlete straight out of high school entered the league with such an insuperable mountain of hype before him and produced such pleasing results. 

Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and Tracy McGrady, all of whom reached superstar status in the NBA, had trouble adjusting to the pace of the professional game coming out of high school, which gave James an edge.

Even though it's too early to tell,  Roethlisberger has proved he's a starting quarterback in the NFL. The rookie quarterback is called the best pure rookie passer in football since Dan Marino, who was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in 1983. 

Roethlisberger shattered NCAA passing records at Miami, Ohio and has yet to suffer a professional loss. He replaced Tommy Maddox as the Steelers starting quarterback in game two of the 2004 season and produced 10 consecutive wins, making Pittsburgh fans forget former Steelers quarterback, Terry Bradshaw, for the first time since his retirement.

We'll see if Roethlisberger, Manning and Phillip Rivers will be mentioned in the same sentence as Marino, Elway, and Kelly. 

However, what makes these drafts spectacular is that they, as a group, are deeper than a single potential superstar. 

Apart from the quarterbacks, other 2004 draftees are slated as being among the potential best in their positions. 

Sean Taylor, for example, has the potential to be the best safety in the game within a few years.

Larry Fitzgerald may be among the top receivers when it's all said and done. Kellen Winslow Jr. may turn out to be the best tight end in football since his father, Kellen Winslow Sr. Offensive lineman Robert Gallery, has been compared to the great and former St. Louis Ram, Orlando Pace. The list goes on.

Similarly, the NBA's 2003 draft was deeper than just King James. 

Carmelo Anthony was every bit as impressive in his rookie season for the Denver Nuggets, and Dwayne Wade proved the Lebron vs. Melo argument deserved a third candidate. 

Wade shined in the 2004 NBA Playoffs, showing no signs of being a rookie. The Heat guard helped turn a squad that started the season with seven straight losses into a playoff team. 

All three rookies­­ - James, Anthony and Wade­­ - were members of the U.S. Olympic Basketball Team in Greece this year.

 Time will tell if these players will continue to shine and be great. In professional sports, nothing is assured. 

Injuries and bad decisions can end a player's development before they reach their peak potential, but like the superstars who began their careers in the 1983 NFL and 1984 NBA drafts, today's young stars can shape the face of sports with their image in the next decade.

Headline: College sex standards fit Hollywood stereotype
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Opinion Page Designer
&nbsp;
College: Just because we are in it, do we really have to play into the Hollywood stereotype of being dirty, sex- craving teenagers?

The other day I was sitting at the Dorothy Chapman Plaza in front of the Graham Center at University Park, analyzing my surroundings, when a 20-something-year-old frat boy sat down at the table next to mine. I automatically thought I was in the midst of a new WB production. 

He was on his cell phone talking to one of his buddies about the different sexual encounters he had that previous weekend. I was utterly disgusted by his words. 

Later in the conversation, three of his friends  at the table joined him in sharing their thoughts on how a specific girl was in bed. Apparently the four of them have a competition each week to see who can "score" the most. All that was missing was Jason Biggs and the production crew of "American Pie 4." 

The worst part about the whole ordeal was how nonchalantly they spoke about the girl. 

I had always disagreed with the way Hollywood stereotypes college students, but after overhearing this conversation, I have realized that Hollywood does have the majority of us figured out, and this is not something to be happy about. 

With the possibility of making something of yourself in the real world and the stress of college altogether, you would think students have better things to worry about other than sex. 

Is this all we are? Is this all we have become? Every movie that has depicted college life is certainly right. 

I don't mean to include those who don't satisfy Hollywood's recurring theme of drunken nights and numerous mindless sexual encounters, but this is something that hits us close to home.

According to the American Social Health Association, the total amount of people in the U.S. with an STD is over 65 million and counting. Fifteen million new cases are discovered every year, and two-thirds of all STDs occur in people 25 years of age or under. Since the average age of a college student is 21, I guess the dangers of promiscuity and STDs weren't pounded into our minds enough during elementary, middle and high school.

I understand the fact that we are all young and supposedly living the best years of our lives, but how gratifying is it really to hop around from one dorm to another just for a couple minutes of enjoyment? How can we take such huge risks? Have all moral standards been completely lost? Are we so dense that we continue living our lives as if everything is OK? 

The day will come  when our generation will look back and be absolutely disgusted with the irrational decisions we made, and until that day comes, we must remain living in the shadow that Hollywood has cast upon us.

Headline: School of Hospitality upset over new curriculum
Author: Mark Scopetta / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Feelings have been running high at the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management since the FIU Faculty Senate approved, by a vote of 37-20, an undergraduate core curriculum - a set of 13 classes that all students must take in order to graduate, regardless off their major.

"A high percentage of our students are transfer students," said Joseph West, the dean of Hospitality and Tourism Management. "Now, because of the UCC, a lot of those transfer students are looking [for their education] elsewhere." He cited  the University of Central Florida as an example, a school some students choose over FIU, because it doesn't have a core curriculum.

During the meeting to decide the curriculum, the department of Arts and Sciences held 29 of the 57 votes and voted in favor of the UCC. 

 "Arts and Sciences voted as a block in favor of the UCC, because it stands to help them," West said. In this new measure, all 13 of the UCC courses are Arts and Sciences classes.

However, this statement was refuted by Bruce Hauptli, an Arts and Sciences senator at the time and the current head of the Faculty Senate.

"I do not specifically remember Arts and Sciences voting as a block in favor of the [UCC]," he said. 

Though the number of votes was recorded, the Faculty Senate did not keep a record of each senator's vote.

According to the Faculty Senate website, UCC courses are important because they help students think critically, analytically and creatively to broaden their base of knowledge, so they will have a passion to learn how to assemble, assess, incorporate, and synthesize new knowledge and information.

However, the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management has always been opposed to the UCC.

"[This school] is losing out on the lucrative out-of-state student because of the UCC. Even if a student wishes to attend FIU, they often don't want to spend the time or money on the extra courses," West said.

Depending on transfer credits, completing the UCC can cost out-of-state transfer students as much as $20,046, and it could take them as many as three additional semesters to fulfill its requirements.

In fall 2002, 665 students were enrolled in the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, and according to reports, that number dropped to 650 in fall 2003 - a decrease of 2.2 percent.

In 2002, the school taught 505 full-time equivalent credit hours. In 2003, that number shrank to 474 hours - a decrease of 6.1 percent.

West believes that the  decrease in the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management's FTE was caused by theUCC.

"Our head count is up," West said, "but the credit hours we teach are down. Students are splitting their time between taking Hospitality and Management courses and fulfilling their core requirements. We've also had to reduce the number of required electives students take, so they can graduate in a timely manner." 

Although the school understands the purpose of the UCC, the outcome remains controversial.

"We aren't against a better education for our students," said Joan Remington, the assistant dean of Hospitality and Tourism Management, "but this is a tough situation."

Raul Moncarz, vice provost of the Biscayne Bay Campus, acknowledged the complaints the faculty might be having.

"The University is in a budget crisis right now, and its priority is the education of the students. [The School of Hospitality and Tourism Management], however, makes a really valid point, and the administration needs to look into it," he said.

Headline: Trading system to eliminate book costs
Author: Luisa Cabrera / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Beginning Dec. 27, students may never have to stand in line at the bookstore again. 

 A new online company, www.switchtextbooks.com, is launching a website which will allow students to exchange books through a network instead of buying them from a bookstore. The only thing students pay for is shipping and a $19.95 annual fee. 

The idea began when Will DeSantis and co-founder Patrick Nagle were standing in line at a bookstore.

Like many students before them, DeSantis and Nagle were hesitant to receive little money for their expensive textbooks by selling them back to a bookstore. When they noticed the customer in front of them had the books they needed, and vice versa, they simply traded.  The website blossomed from there. 

Students can try the website for free. By filling out a profile and giving their email, they can be notified the moment a match is found for their book. They can look up the book they need by ISBN number, or by keyword. 

If a match is found, the students use their credits from previous trades to order their books.

Credits are gained and lost depending on whether a student sends or receives a book. No money is exchanged through the system.

Students can also receive a $5 credit for each friend they recruit to the website, which they receive as a check at the end of the month. 

Books are graded on a seven-degree system, ranging from brand new to poor. 

DeSantis and Nagle are working with the Baker and Taylor Corporation to ensure that the correct market value is given to each book. 

"We've created a multi-tear trading platform," said DeSantis. "A trades with C, C trades with B and B trades with A.  What that ensures is that we all trade to keep the cycle flowing. In essence, we are maximizing the value of your book."

DeSantis and Nagle agree that textbooks have become unaffordable for students.  They claim their website will eliminate the middle man.  

"Too much money is being made through school stores," said DeSantis. "What we're trying to do is help students network and save them as much money as possible because tuition is going through the roof. We never want the students to feel like we're taking anything from them. We're setting up this system to make it as big as possible and to help college kids."

The website is being promoted at 4,000 colleges nationwide and will reach an estimated 9-13 million college students by 2006.  

DeSantis and Nagle are also working on a system where teachers can post the books they will use in their classes.  

"Basically," said Nagle, "bookstores make too much money off  [the student].  We know what it's like to sell a book back for $10 and then come back to the bookstore and see it on the shelf for 75 dollars.  They are taking advantage of you."

Needless to say, the bookstore is not taking the competition lightly.

"I'm sure it will make us more competitive," said Chris Quaintance, the University Park bookstore operations manager. "But once [students] have exhausted other sources, they come home."

Neither of the FIU Barnes and Noble bookstore managers seem too distraught about the project, claiming to know that private deals happen around them all the time.  

"What most people don't know," said Quaintance, "is that 10 percent of our profit goes back to FIU.  How much of their profit will you [the student] benefit from?  I don't think the bookstore will suffer that much. There is always hesitation when a student is asked to take a risk without any return."

Headline: Alexander the Not-So-Great
Author: Auturo Sande / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Alexander the Great never lost a war. By age 30, he had conquered the known world and extended his empire to the far reaches of the earth. But his greatness was just too hard to translate onto film. 

In the film "Alexander," Oliver Stone and Warner Brothers attempt this insurmountable task and, for the most part, fail greatly.

Almost all the elements of Alexander's legend are there - the belief that he was the son of Zeus; his taming of Bucephalus, his great horse; his conquest of the Persian Empire; his entry into Babylon and his quest to leave his mark as the ruler of the greatest empire known to man. 

The movie attempts to delve into Alexander's soul to  find out what made him such a powerful force. In some ways it is an attempt to mortalize an immortal, and therein lies its undoing. 

The film shows Alexander trying to understand and respect every new culture and includes its positive aspects into his own strict Macedonian heritage. Although the movie portrays him as a demi-god, a leader, a conqueror, a lover (of both men and women), a tyrant, a drunk and a barbarian, the movie feels pretentious, self-indulgent and over-excessive. It is also boring and runs an hour too-long. 

Alexander's story is told in flashbacks by Ptolemy, one of Alexander's generals, now an old man and ruler of Alexandria, but the flashbacks are an ill-conceived device. The movie suffers a great deal because of the confusing editing, mainly during battle scenes where the audience cannot really tell what is happening or which side is winning and why. It is as if Stone filmed Alexander's entire life from birth-to-death, and unsure of what to use in his movie, just started cutting away frantically, overemphasizing, downplaying or simply omitting certain aspect of Alexander's life. He neglects the use of coherence. 

This is not to say that the film is not visually stunning. Yet Stone, who has always had a flair for the visual, seems more interested in the controversies surrounding Alexander's life than in its actual facts. Did Olympus, Alexander's mother, have Alexander's father, Philip, murdered? Was Alexander himself murdered by his own men? 

These questions are not really answered in the end, but by that time you will not care. 

Val Kilmer plays Philip and Angelina Jolie plays Olympias. Their acting is awkward and their mere physical presence is not enough to carry the movie.

Colin Farrell plays Alexander as a tortured soul, torn between the love he feels for his parents and the hate his parents feel for each other. Farrell always looks in pain, as if the price Alexander pays for greatness is a short life, filled with suffering. 

With the success that "Braveheart" and "Gladiator," two other sword-and sandal epics, achieved at the box office and at the Academy awards, it is understandable why a studio wanted to make a grand adaptation of Alexander's life. The result is a major misfire.

Headline: Student film festival to keep cinematic culture alive
Author: Allan Pichardo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For those students with a  cinematic flair, the FIU's lack of an undergraduate film program may be a bit disconcerting. 

There was the alliance between the university and the Miami International Film Festival, but, alas, it was too short-lived. Though artists in the visual arts, drama and music have outlets at FIU, student filmmakers have been left to fend for themselves in their search for exposure. For this invisible community, the Student Programming Council's first student film festival, Through the Lens, is definitely a relief that is long overdue. 

"This is the first year, but I hope it can establish itself as a tradition," said Through the Lens coordinator, Krystal Alvarez.  She has been planning this event since the start of the Fall semester.

The event will be held at 7 p.m. on Jan. 12 at the University Park Graham Center Ballrooms. All students are welcome to submit their work. The deadline for submissions is Dec. 7 at 6 p.m.  Those who wish to enter have to download an application from the forums at www.yourspc.com. According to Alvarez, all entries may be no longer than 18 minutes and may be submitted in DVD, VHS or VCD format to the SPC office in GC 341 at UP.

After the submissions deadline, a committee of SPC members will eliminate films with excessive gore, violence or otherwise distasteful content.  The films that pass the filtering process will be screened at the festival.

The top three films will be selected by a panel of judges consisting of two professors and SPC advisor, Manny Rosa. First place will win $250, second place receives, $150 and third place wins, $75. The winners will be announced the night of the festival.

"There is an art museum where students can show their art," said Alvarez.  "But there is nowhere where students can display their films."  

Through the festival, she hopes to keep the culture of cinematic artists at the university alive.  

Students are encouraged to attend and support their fellow students.  Through the Lens will be open to the public free of charge. Refreshments will be served.

Headline: Soca Bar celebrates Caribbean culture
Author: Maersa Patience / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Picture this: a moonlit night in a busy city. 

A cool river breeze and a bar with a big cypress tree as its

centerpiece, its branches cascading over to, create a natural canopy.

Guests sit and sip cocktails in the sight, sounds and scents of the Caibbean, in stark contrast to the blaring city sounds of the surrounding Miami area.

On the second Saturday of every month, The Big Fish Restaurant on 55 S.W. Miami Ave. creates a refreshing, unique blend of Caribbean

music that can't be heard anywhere else. 

Thanks to four  friends from Trinidad

and Tobago and Jamaica, music lovers can now enjoy Caribbean music in a diverse and unique enviornment. An enviornment that Jonathan Suite, Kevin Palmer, Troy Marshall and Damien Smart,

created by blending their personal cultures into a Caribbean night for the masses.

The name Big Phat Fish came

from the group's love of soca, a type of music that is a blend of calypso and soul which was created in the West Indies. 

"[Big Phat Fish] came from a soca song by

Marshall Montano, a Trinidadian artist," Marshall  said.     

Big Phat Fish's logo  was inspired by Mama Glo,

a Trinidadian folklore character, who is considered a river goddess, she

takes the shape of a half-human and half-fish or water snake and is usually seen sitting on a river rock

combing her long hair.

The logo for Big Phat Fish, an enchanting mermaid with long hair, is the image from that Mama Glo often

takes.

Mama Glo is the preserver of the Caribbean's friendliness, diversity and

unity. 

Her legend, according to Trinidadian writer, Shelley Marshell,  is a tie that binds the scattered peoples of the

Caribbean. 

Big

Phat Fish brings together those separate islands into one

place, through soca, a  friendly energy that  provides a

window into Caribbean culture. 

At Big Phat Fish you experience a variety of music from all the

Caribbean islands like reggae, dub, retro and hip-hop with an emphasis on

soca. 

It offers a first-class music experience  and also aims to introduce other cultures to the

sweetness of the Caribbean. 

"Big Phat Fish has

been successfully running for six months with an increasing interest

by the Jamaican population in Miami. We are hoping to have a bigger

turn out of American people," Marshall said.

The founders' hope  that Big Phat Fish will be the

showcase for soca music from all over the Caribbean.

    The next Big Phat Fish

event will be held on the Dec. 11. 

  "I hope Big Phat Fish will make soca known as the

music of the Caribbean and someday break into the mainstream market as

reggae has done," co-founder Jonathan Suite said.
