Subheadline: 12 stages, 14 hours, one hell of a show

&nbsp;
Thousands of party people gathered anxiously awaiting, the Ultra Music Festival, a dance music lovers utopia, in the early afternoon of March 6. 

For 14 straight hours, people from all around the world came together to witness the industry's top DJs and performers work their electronic magic. 

While I was there, I met people from Ireland, New York, Daytona, Michigan, London, and even Korea. 

This wonderland of music consisted of 12 stages positioned along downtown Miami's 32-acre Bayfront Park, divided by sub-genres such as the house, progressive, breakbeats and drum and bass just to name a few. 

There were also various vending areas, full service liquor bars for the 21 and over, food and concession tents set up, as well as exclusive VIP areas and table service. One of the VIP areas resembled a beach lounge complete with sand and canopied beds.

During the day, the most popular tents were the Breakbeats Pavilion and the House Tent, which was designed to resemble a giant flying saucer. Other happening areas were the Freedom Arena, were artists such as Boy George performed, and the Raw Power/Vice Stage, where The Rapture, a band which played predominantly rock music, made its Ultra Music Festival debut. 

"Watching The Rapture perform was fantastic," said Gaby Oviedo, an FIU hospitality management major. "It's a nice addition to Ultra because it is a live performance with actual instruments."

All in all, the place to be was definitely the night-time spectacles at the Ultra main stage, with intense light shows and  headliner DJs performing, such as the renowned DJ Tiesto from Amsterdam. Tiesto has won Best International DJ two years in a row at the DanceStar awards. 

"The performance was something that words alone cannot describe; Tiesto is number one for a reason, his performance says it all," said festival-goer Adrian Ridero. 

The night came to an end with an electrifying performance by Paul Van Dyke, who won this year's DanceStar award for Best International DJ. With the Ultra Music Festival ending at midnight, anxious party-goers were swarming to hit the after parties all over Miami at venues such as Club Space.  Prices for exclusive clubs sky-rocketed for the week of the Winter Music Conference; which is why a $55 general admission seems like a steal for Ultra, considering that if you wanted to see a single superstar DJ at a major club, it would have cost you about the same if not more.

All in all, the Ultra Music Festival is a true dance music phenomenon. The energy of the crowd is something you don't encounter every day. It is a day and a place where you are exposed to so many different types of music in a truly relaxed atmosphere. You can go as dressed up or dressed down as you want, you can lie on the grass or sit on a bleacher, you can be yourself and not worry about anyone judging you. For 14 hours, the world seems to come to a halt and you become one with the pulse-pounding music.

Headline: Vinyl hunters dig for special music finds
Author: Evelyn McDonnell/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
MIAMI - Andrew Yeomanson, (DJ Le Spam) scans the tens of thousands of vinyl LPs and 45s in Blue Note Records' North Miami Beach warehouse with an eager, practiced eye. He squints down the rows of bins and crates that line two floors of this retail annex, a hunter surveying the terrain.

''Here's the jazz, here's the Latin, here's the funk,'' points out store owner Bob Perry, who has been handling vinyl since he did radio promotion in the 1970s. The new records guy follows the old records guy's finger with a nod. Then Spam starts digging.

Digging is DJ jargon for the art of finding rare grooves. It's something the legions of dance-music denizens who converged on Miami Beach this week for the Winter Music Conference and M3 (Miami, Music and Media) Summit were squeezing in time for, in between poolside meetings and late-night gigs.

Compact discs replaced LPs in most people's homes a decade ago. But vinyl is still the primary medium for disc jockeys. You can't slip a needle into a CD's grooves and spin it back and forth, making your sound out of someone else's.

Many hip-hop and dance-music DJs know Blue Note. In a region of the country where body-wax salons outnumber record stores a zillion to 1, the 20-year-old independent retail outlet is a destination. (The warehouse annex, 2291 NE 164th St., is just a couple of miles down the street from Perry's 16401 NE 15th Ave. shop.) Rap artists Afrika Bambaataa, Biz Markie and Timbaland; house music deity Danny Tenaglia; and Plastic Fantastic of Japan have all shopped here.

Actually, stores aren't DJs' favorite digging venues. Instead, Yeomanson speaks excitedly of the private garage in West Palm Beach, stacked floor to ceiling with 45s, that he used to visit once or twice a month, or the two double-wide mobile homes in Lake Worth. Digging literally involves getting your hands into a lot of junk before you unearth that rare gem.

''A good day of digging would be if I take my car and go from place to place,'' Yeomanson says. ``At the end of the day, I'm going to be dizzy and my hands are going to be black and I'm going to have a big stack of records that I haven't sorted.''

He looks for Latin, funk, spoken word and jazz records, the genres he blends for his signature Spam sound. The living room of his North Miami home is filled with what he estimates are 10,000 to 15,000 records. Many he has never listened to. Still, he wants more.

''I've got enough to keep me busy till I'm old,'' Yeomanson says.

Collectors like Yeomanson are keepers of America's recording history. But collecting can become a shut-in's obsession. The dysfunctional emotional profile of the geek who lives for his records was well captured by the book and movie High Fidelity. Yeomanson does not want to go there.

''You can drive yourself crazy with trying to get a good price,'' he says. ``If you're obsessive already, collecting can push you over.''

The art of digging has been changed dramatically by the Internet. ''EBay (messed) up all the record collectors,'' Yeomanson says. ``It became the great equalizer in terms of price. Now you have to work twice as hard to find things.''

At Blue Note, amid racks and racks of old jazz albums and hip-hop 12-inches, they'll find a treasure trove of some of the hottest commodities: Miami soul.

For Perry, it means that his career has come full circle since he started working in the warehouse of Hialeah's legendary Tone Distributors, stacking records by such greats as Helene Smith and Betty Wright. Now those records can be worth hundreds of dollars.

''That's what everybody wants,'' he says.

Spam wants it. He's eyeing a 45 by mostly forgotten singer Jeanette Holloway. Perry has pulled the single out of a special stash and seems reluctant to let it go. He finally agrees to sell, for the bargain price of $5, to the leader of the Spam Allstars.

What's bad for diggers is good for dealers. The person willing to pay $1,000 for a rare B-side may not walk through Blue Note's doors but will search the Internet.

''Without eBay, I wouldn't have this,'' Perry says, pointing at the Blue Note warehouse. With the recording industry struggling, old vinyl can be a retailer's lifeline. "You can't survive selling CDs in this business. There's no profit in new stuff.''

Guest lecturer's credentials questionable

To the Editor:

FIU's Student Government Association promoted the evolution lecture by Dr. Carl Baugh like the United States president was coming to speak. 
I did a short internet search to learn a little more about Baugh and it didn't take long to find out that he is a fraud.

"Dr." Baugh, who in fact is not a doctor and doesn't have a doctorate in philosophy, is being promoted as a scientist when in reality he is a fraudulent preacher. Perhaps the most troublesome of Baugh's claims concerns his credentials. Baugh claims to have earned a doctorate in theology as well as advanvced degrees in several fields of science, yet there is no evidence that Baugh has any earned degrees whatsoever. 
To see a detailed discussion on this matter, please see the article "A Matter of Degree," at www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/degrees.html. 
Although it is possible to do good work without having advanced degrees, misrepresenting one's credentials is a serious matter which bears directly on one's basic honesty and integrity. 

Some Christians will try to use Baugh's "evidences" in witnessing and get "shot down" by someone who is scientifically literate.
The ones witnessed to will thereafter be wary of all creation evidences and even more inclined to dismiss Christians as nut cases not worth listening to. Also, the Christian is likely to be less apt to witness, even perhaps tempted to doubt his or her own faith (wondering what other misinformation they have gullibly believed from Christian teachers). 
The Christian Student Fellowship tries to strengthen the faith of Christians and equip them for the work of evangelism, and, sadly, the long term effect of Baugh's efforts will be detrimental to both. So what's up with SGA? I'm sure some FIU students went to listen to Baugh and have been misled. This is what I'm always keeping a look out for. 
It's hard enough to sift through the fakes without having to deal with SGA also trying to misdirect people. 
What's the lesson?  You must choose where you get your information wisely. Misdirection is everywhere.   
Whoever at SGA is responsible for this should be voted out of office.

Gays encounter ignorance, prejudice on road to social equality

To the Editor:

"By changing oneself then one's family you have opened the door to changing your neighbors, your town, and your country,"  said Eduardo Baqueiro in a column published in The Beacon on March 3.  This is what gay people do everyday.  Despite danger and obstacles we come out to ourselves, our families, our neighbors. We fight the battle for equality every day of our lives, a struggle no heterosexual person could ever truly know.   Now our struggle takes us to an even more visible and dangerous space in our quest for the equality of marriage.
 Gay families exist now.  We are not a new occurrence that has suddenly sprung on society seeking to destroy it. We have existed forever. It is now that we are being viewed as a threat because we are asking to be acknowledged and treated equally in the eyes of the law.  

Some feel that we are being difficult because we are not willing to accept "separate but equal" accommodations. Throughout our history, this has been an attempt to pacify and silence minorities. This is an attempt to silence us, to diminish our love and commitment to one another and the children we raise. Rosa Parks did not accept separate but equal. Martin Luther King did not accept separate but equal.  I see no difference. It pains me to see that so many people are being fooled by the elite hierarchy of our country which sits on its throne throwing peanuts at us all, as we fight for them like pigeons. Only when we move beyond these squabbles will we be able to put an end to inequality in all forms. This is bigger than just gays looking to make a stink and cause problems. It is this generation's call to action. 

We will not accept second class status anymore. It is neither illogical nor unnecessary.  It is our survival as people and families. "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" does not signal our status as free people. 
How can we be free when newspaper articles like yours call our families a cancer on society? The cancer of our society is ignorance. It is our perpetual dismissiveness of our own history that enables intolerance, hatred, and inequality to exist. Examining, owning, and deconstructing our own biases and prejudices is how we can all work to create the "healthy society" you speak of.

Headline: Picking up Steam
Subheadline: The Golden Panthers, who are already in danger of not making Regionals for the second straight year after a 7-14 start, looked to get their season back on track with three home games against Pittsburgh, Sacred Heart and Temple.
Author: Natalie Sabia AND Miguel Quintero/ Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
March 11 - FIU 7, Pittsburgh 3

The Golden Panthers, led by David Asher's strong pitching and Mike Lopez's timely hitting, defeated Pittsburgh, 7-3, at the Homestead Sports Complex March 11.

FIU added 10 hits on the night to back Asher, who recorded his first career victory as a Golden Panther after allowing only three runs in 7 and two-thirds innings, to go along with eight strikeouts. The 7 and two-thirds innings by Asher (1-0) was the longest outing by a Golden Panther pitcher this season.

Lopez set a career high with five RBIs. He picked up three RBIs on a two-out single in the bottom of the first inning to give FIU a 3-0 lead. Pittsburgh cut FIU's lead to 4-2 in the third inning on an RBI single by P.J. Hiser. 

FIU responded with two runs in the bottom half of the inning on RBI singles by Dennis Diaz and Lopez, capitalizing on a pair of Pittsburgh errors.

Junior Mark Worrell took over in the bottom of the seventh to preserve the victory. The right hander from Boynton Beach struck out two in an inning and a third.  

The victory was much-needed for FIU who is seeking to get over .500 before conference play begins March 26.

"Every game, our mind set is to win, especially as we head into conference games," Diaz said. "We really just want to get back on a winning streak ... Coach Price has changed his approach towards us.  It has helped us to stay more focused."

March 12 - FIU 18, Sacred Heart 9

FIU scored 17 runs over a three-inning span to put away the Pioneers at University Park March 12. P.J. Lehmann, Cody Jacobs and Luis Rivera combined for eight RBIs to lead FIU offensively. FIU scored three runs in the fifth inning, six in the sixth and eight in the seventh to break a 1-1 tie.

Andrew Edwards (3-1) picked up his third victory of the season after allowing only one earned run in five innings, despite giving up nine hits.

Yahmed Yema chipped in with three hits and David San Juan scored three runs for the Golden Panthers (9-14).

March 13 - FIU 13, Temple 12

FIU put together a late rally and prevented Temple head coach Skip Wilson from recording his 1,000th career victory with a 13-12 win at UP March 13.

"We used the fact that we didn't want to be another memory for a team as our motivation," said Diaz.

FIU trailed 12-9 in the bottom of the eighth inning, but tied the game after three consecutive RBI by Lehmann, Jacobs and Yema.

Lopez followed that with an RBI double to give FIU the 13-12 lead.

Temple catcher Marc Wagner drove in a game-high four runs, while seven of the nine batters in the lineup picked up multiple hits, but it wasn't enough.

Jeff Skellenger, along with Lopez, hit back-to-back home runs in the third inning marking the third time FIU had accomplished the feat.

Yema added two hits, two runs and an RBI to lead FIU. 

"I was looking for a good approach at the plate ... It was a tough game defensively, but our offense came through," Yema said. "The team is coming together ... There's lots of energy."

FIU trailed 9-5 and 12-8 in the middle of the sixth and seventh innings, but responded with three runs in both innings to keep the game within reach.

"Our team is really showing character right now.  We just keep on fighting," said Diaz.

Added head coach Danny Price: "We hung in there ... We didn't play as good as we could have, but when you shake up the middle, things happen. Biggest thing is we won.  Six days in all and we're still on the same page."

Danny Hernandez pitched three strong innings in relief for the Golden Panthers (10-14) to raise his record to 2-0.  

For the Owls, Chris Hamilton received the loss and fell to 1-1.

"I felt like I let down the team in the seventh, but we stayed in the game. I was confident in my teammates, I focused on them," said Hernandez.

Headline: Softball places second in Blue and Gold Coca-Cola Classic
Author: Andres Cordero/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It was a different type of madness that struck FIU this month as the Golden Panther women's softball team hosted its fourth and final tournament of the season. FIU welcomed Massachusetts, Miami (Ohio), and Virginia Tech this weekend at University Park for the Blue and Gold Coca-Cola Classic.

FIU won four of five games, including consecutive victories over VT, MU, UMass and MU again before a 4-3 loss to UMass in the tournament final. Perhaps more impressive though, is the turn-around the team has undergone since hosting the first tournament of the year in late January. 

FIU struggled out of the gate posting a record of 4-13 through the end of February. That's as many wins in more than a month as in this last tournament. The lack of timely hitting and little run support plagued the team through that stretch but alas, March arrived. 

Although still playing catch-up-to .500, FIU has won seven of the nine games played so far this month. They've outscored their opponents 40-18 through the last nine games and look much more like the team that was predicted to finish second in the Sun-Belt Conference. FIU currently holds the fourth spot in the conference.

March 12 - FIU 4, VT 2  /  FIU 6, MU 4 (8 innings)

The FIU squad entered the Blue and Gold Coca-Cola Classic riding its first two-game winning streak since the start of the season. They added two more wins over Virginia Tech and Miami (Ohio), extending the win streak to four games.

 Left-hander Amanda Nealer (2-4) pitched four innings against VT, allowing three hits and and only two runs en route to a 4-2 victory.

Run support was the primary concern through the month-long slump, but the Golden Panthers got plenty of it in this one. 

Junior Jacque Vetters, the leadoff batter and last week's Sun Belt Conference Hitter of the Week, found her way to first base via a single to right center to start things off in the top of the first. Senior Cindy Turek laid down the sacrifice bunt to advance Vetters to second. Back-to-back singles by Jennifer Owens and Marleah Stapf plated Vetters to open the scoring. Owens would score on a throwing error later in the inning.  

Mindi Wylie drove one in for the Hokies with an RBI single in the second, but the host team would regain its two-run advantage in the fourth with Turek scoring on Owens' high-hopping groundout to first. 

Nealer allowed a second earned run in the fifth on another Hokie RBI single by left fielder Callie Rhodes, narrowing the FIU lead to one. 

But the hometown girls produced the game's final run in the seventh, putting FIU up 4-2 on Jennifer Powell's off-the-wall, two-out double that scored Stapf in from first.

Nicole Barret pitched the game's final inning for FIU and got Virginia Tech to foul out, ground out and fly out, retiring the side and picking up her second save on the year.

The offense did not let up in game two, as FIU built a 4-0 lead with four runs in the second inning against Miami University which resulted in a 6-4 FIU win.

The second inning was a nightmare for Jackie Poggendorf, who pitched all eight innings for the Lady RedHawks. 

FIU's Kristen Perry doubled to start the inning and Powell then reached on a fielder's choice, while Perry advanced to third. Powell then stole second, putting two runners in scoring position for freshman Brittany Witherow. 

Witherow struck out swinging, but such was Poggendorf's luck that she reached first on a wild pitch. Lindsay Tippings stepped to plate and produced a no-outs, bases loaded, two-run double down the left field line before freshman Tabitha Embry followed up with a bases clearing triple to score two more, giving FIU the 4-0 lead. 

Kendra Laminack put in five scoreless innings on the hill, allowing just three hits, one walk with eight strikeouts before being replaced by Nicole Barret to start the sixth. 

But Poggendorf retaliated, this time with her bat, as she sent a line drive to center, scoring runners from first and third before eventually scoring herself on a throwing error. The FIU lead was now trimmed to one and erased in the bottom of the seventh by a two-out RedHawk rally that sent the game into extra innings. 

Barret would settle down and retire the side in order off three groundouts in the eighth. Powell hit a game-winning, RBI groundout to second before Witherow followed with her team-leading 12th RBI to put the game away.

March 13 - FIU 2 , UMass 1  /  FIU 6, MU 1

Wins came in pairs for the FIU Softball team as they followed up a two-win performance on day one with another two March 13. 

This time FIU defeated Massachusetts in the first game and Miami (Ohio) in the next. The wins stretched FIU's winning streak to six games and earned the team a place in the tournament final.

A two-run double by Owens gave FIU a 2-1 victory in game one.

The Minutewomen took a 1-0 lead into the sixth inning with the lone run scored on a fielding error in the second. Pitcher Kelli Arnold carried a one-hit shutout into the sixth for UMass, but the FIU bats were not to be denied. 

Owens then connected with the big hit in the bottom of the sixth, scoring Hernandez and Vetters, both of whom reached on bunts, to give the Golden Panthers a late 2-1 lead.

Nealer pitched 6.1 innings for the host team and allowed one unearned runon four hits. 

She started the sixth and retired the first batter she faced, but was replaced by Barrett, who downed the next two in order to end the game and pick up her third save of the season.      

FIU followed the win over UMass with three runs in the first and another three in the third en route to an impressive 6-1 win over Miami (OH).

Owens and Turek combined on a double steal to open the scoring in the first. Owens later scored on a groundout by Stapf and Perry added a third run on a Miami throwing error. 

Owens and Perry got involved in the third inning as well, as both singled to start a second rally. This time, Owens and Perry combined on a double steal, scoring Owens from third and extending the FIU lead to 4-0. Stapf drove in her second RBI of the game and later scored on an Embry single to left. 

The Redhawks got a meaningless run in the sixth and the combination of Laminack and Barret, finished the 6-1 victory off and propelled FIU to the final.

March 14 - Tournament  Final - Umass 4, FIU 3

A crucial error by Vetters late in the game led to a 4-3 UMass win over FIU in the Blue and Gold Coca-Cola Classic Final.

Massachusetts got on the scoreboard first as Pam Sulick sent a two-out double off the left field wall in the fourth to score Jamie Cahalan from first. 

An RBI single by the Blue and Gold Coca-Cola Classic MVP, Katie Jo Kelley, put UMass ahead 2-0 in the fifth.

But the Golden Panthers rallied and took a 3-2 lead going into the seventh. Owens, Perry, and Stapf reached base on consecutive singles and Owens scored first for the Panthers on a throwing error at first base. Powell's left field double scored Perry and Stapf for the one-run lead. 

The remainder of the game, however, belonged to UMass as Sulick knocked a routine ball to center that was misplayed by Vetters and allowed two more UMass runs.

The loss made FIU the tournament's runner-up, behind UMass.

Owens became the second FIU player in a row to be awarded Sun Belt Conference Hitter of the Week, based on a seven-hit, three-RBI performance over the weekend.

Headline: US Needs to be Just Broker
Subheadline:  
Author: os21@aol.com
&nbsp;
Justice is a word that we usually like to be associated with. To call someone "unjust" is most definitely an insult. Being unjust leads to being hated. It leads to revolt, retaliation, and violence. The United States has been unjust. Its policies between Israel and Palestine have not been just, they have been one sided for far too long. Its miserable and showy attempts at brokering peace between the to sides has been laughable and deplorable. Since I can remember as far back as when I was old enough to care "peace" between Israel and Palestine has been nothing but a mirage. It is a fantasy that my generation has grown up with because of politicians whose agendas and goals are not for peace, but for power and authority. 
	The U.S media has been nothing but a caterer to the Israeli government's propaganda. Assassinations by the Israeli government have become "targeted killings," the wanton destruction of towns and homes have become "military incursions," and the killing of innocent Palestinians are now just a collection of ghosts that are never even so much as mentioned on the air. Contrary to this is the suicide bombings that occur in Israel where every person murdered is mentioned by name, their age, profession, and family history all mentioned on air in an attempt to not just gain sympathy to the atrocity afflicted on the Israeli people, but to sway American opinion to the side of Israel. For how many innocent Israelis who have died in this useless war, how many innocent Palestinians have been murdered by Israeli "military incursions?" The Israeli government blames Hamas for the killing of nearly 400 Israeli civilians since September 2000, but who will condemn Israel for its killing of 1,760 Palestinians, 263 of whom were under the age of 14, in that same time period? The US government? The US media? We already know the answer to that.
	We are made to believe that Israel's retaliations against the Palestinians is because of suicide bombings, that it is Israel who is responding to the violence being inflicted upon it and its people. The Palestinians are just a population of mass murderers and experts at making bombs. This has been the lie that has become truth by way of Israel's propaganda machine. The fact of the matter is that Israel has occupied Palestinian land for 35 years. For 35 years the Palestinian people have been fighting this illegal occupation of their land. The Palestinian people are not fighting the Israelis out of some sort of natural hatred, as the Israeli government would like it to seem. They are fighting because of injustice. They are fighting because of illegal Israeli "settlements" on their land. These settlements are not small houses on Palestinian land, but they are large military-like compounds that have stolen valuable resources from the nearby Palestinian towns and villages, where water and rich soil have become the property of these so-called settlers. 
	It often raises eyes in this country when suicide bombings are explained. The Israeli government likes to make this Palestinian military strategy seem as if it were only pure and calculated murder. The reasons why a person would strap a bomb onto their chest and kill themselves and others around them is a question not worth answering for them. It is the same intense hatred fostered into a people that led to September 11th. That hatred is not something that is imbedded into Palestinian genes, it is a hatred that grows from oppression and humiliation. It is something we do not like to admit our nation might be guilty of fostering. Check-points where Israeli army men stand guard and prevent Palestinians from going to visit their families, to get medical aid for their sick, or from simply to buy groceries. Imagine living like that and imagine how much you would hate the person doing that to you. Then imagine that the nation doing this to you, and your family and your friends, your people, is a nation with the fifth largest standing army in the world, the only country in the Middle East with nuclear weapons, and a nation with a vast array of weapons to use besides its nuclear arsenal, such as tanks and helicopters at its full disposal, mostly supplied by our nation, the United States of America.  
	Only when this injustice is stopped will Israeli citizens be able to go to work or to the movies without having to worry about being killed. When their government stops supporting the destruction of Palestinian towns and its occupation of Palestinian land and is just in its dealings with its weaker neighbor will there be peace. For the United States this is an opportunity to do something just. Instead of vetoing ever condemnation the United Nations passes against an Israeli atrocity committed against the Palestinians, of which there have been 64 such UN resolutions passed against Israel, the United States can start condemning what the rest of the world already knows. Once our government does this will we stop wondering why the people in the Middle East hate us so much.

Author: call@kingcambo.com
&nbsp;
Dear Editors,
 
I am like you, in the sense that I have a really big mouth and a lot of people listen to me. On a much smaller scale of course. The following is a small article I sent out to 12,000 day trader morons who subscribe to my inane drivel regarding the stock markets. I wonder if you might be willing to grab the salient points of it, make it your own and just get the word out. Maybe between the two of us we can begin to stop the cycle of hate. Thanks for reading this, if you do read it.
best,
KingCAMBO
 
Good Morning All,

I am on a cc list from a Major who reports what is going over in the war from the front lines. Today he writes:

"Now here's a practical way to help the children of Iraq...the psyopers at Junction City buy toys for kids out of their pockets! How cool is that. If you would be willing they would love to distribute more of the following: cheap SMALL plastic toys from a dollar store, pens, school paper, crayons, individually wrapped hard candy...would you be so kind as to put together care boxes...small boxes not huge, for these guys to hand deliver?"

When I first read that I said to myself, yeah OK here is another bleeding heart do-gooder idea leading nowhere. But then, upon reflection I had an epiphany of sorts. 

What if each one of these kids, who gets a box of candy stops growing up hating our guts? What if they no longer grow to be teenagers who are willing to strap on a bomb vest and walk in to a Starbucks to blow the hell out of us while we are trying to enjoy a peaceful breakfast?

What if, for a lousy 5 or 10 bucks and a drive to Walmart any one of us can prevent something awful occurring 15 years from now? How much did you lose on your last day trade?

Put this in some perspective!

Get off your lazy daytrading butts and send this guy some candy, please. Here is the info:

Was I not reason enough
Did I in turn become the blame
You are a beloved thief
The tremors underneath my shell
Time cannot ease the guilt of your memory
Did my hand pull the trigger
Was ignorance my saving grace
Did I not kill but not attempt to save
You burden me with the wounded mirror
I hate you
Can I join you my friend
Will I just crawl another lifelong inch
As a hostage under your care
You have all of me

Headline: Wal-mart trumps workers
Author: Ted Randall/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
I have never admired the corporate culture of America.

I detest corporate greed, corruption, conformity, and the inhumane obsession with the bottom line. 

I was not surprised when the scandals at Enron and WorldCom became public. They are just the tip of the iceberg. Although CEOs and CFOs of those companies lied about profits and losses, destroyed thousands of workers' 401Ks and made hundreds of millions of dollars by secretly selling their shares, all we hear about today is lil' ol' Martha Stewart. 

I have to admit that the productiveness and profitability of our free-market capitalist system is most impressive but so are its abuses. 

Deregulation and the preposterous idea of self governing corporations have resulted in a crisis in corporate America. 

Greedy crooks embezzle, profit from insider trading, and lie to the IRS and shareholders. Corporations continue to make record-breaking profits while workers' real wages decline and millions lose their jobs to offshore slavery. Without proper regulation it is the status quo, business as usual. But hope is not lost. There is light at the end of the tunnel - Wal-Mart. 

Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer. Its superstores are a consumer's dream come true. 

You can take the car in for an oil change and tire rotation, pickup some steaks for dinner, find that perfect lamp shade, and buy a bag of mulch for the flower bed. Wal-Mart's competitive pricing strategy wreaks havoc on suppliers and the competition, which, according to CNN Money, saves consumers $20 billion a year.

Gee, thanks, Wal-Mart. 

Fortune magazine recently ranked Wal-Mart number one on its list of most admired companies for the second year in a row. According to CNN Money online, Fortune uses eight areas of criteria to measure a corporation's worthiness, including value, quality of service, long term investment, and management.  Here is what I find admirable about Wal-Mart. Typically, Wal-Mart finds a market area it wants to exploit, does a profitability study, and decides it wants to build a superstore in your neighborhood. It spends lots of money and time cooking up a PR scheme to convince the locals that such a store is a good idea.

A few people protest against the incursion (there have been communities that have defeated Wal-Mart, but the store usually gets what it wants). A huge unadorned warehouse of a store is erected amidst an ocean-sized parking lot. It eventually destroys all the local merchants. It pays employees minimum wage out of which they must purchase their own healthcare, which is so expensive only two in five workers do so. Wal-Mart employees are the working poor.  

I find the fact that Wal-Mart is the target of a federal grand jury probing into the company knowingly employing (exploiting) illegal workers most admirable. And of course there are the dozens of cases of wage violations and gender discrimination that make me want to go right out and buy stock.  

Women make up nearly 72 percent of Wal-Mart's "associates" (cute word for employee isn't it?) but only 33 percent of its managers. According to Brandeis University's Women's Studies Research Program, Wal-Mart's business practices "may be leading to a new kind of globally sanctioned gender discrimination." 

In July, a federal judge will be determining a class-certification hearing in a discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart. The outcome may lead to the largest civil rights class-action suit in history, affecting 700,000 women. That is impressive and could be worthy of my admiration. 

The criteria I find most qualifying is the indifference Wal-Mart has for the workers who manufacture its products.

Most major clothing stores traffic in sweatshop labor but Wal-Mart is infamously bad. 

Wal-Mart clothing is made in China. Workers in China do not have the right to organize. Labor rights are non-existent.

Think of American laborers at the peak of the industrial age before labor unions relieved the yoke of oppression. They were working seven days a week for pennies an hour. They were not allowed to speak while on the line. They had to eat their lunch while waiting in-line for their one and only bathroom break.

No coffee or smoking breaks. No safety. No overtime. No life. That is a Wal-Mart-run Chinese sweatshop.

Wal-Mart refuses to tell labor rights advocates even where its shops are. 

The store was removed from the Domini 400 Social Index, a very influential socially responsible investment fund for abhorred labor rights record. Nike is the only other company scratched from the list. How admirable.  

Fortune magazine really knows how to pick them.

Headline: Bush ad criticizes Kerry's vote against Iraq funding
Author: Matt Stearns/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
WASHINGTON - President Bush unveiled a new ad Tuesday against his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry. It hit the airwaves in West Virginia, a swing state where Kerry campaigned Tuesday, and may be rolled out nationally.

The Ad 

Called "Troops," it says "few votes in Congress are as important as funding our troops at war." Voiceovers imitate a Senate roll-call vote, as a narrator says Kerry voted to support military action in Iraq, but "later voted against funding our soldiers," against body armor for troops in combat, against higher combat pay and against better health care for reservists and their families. The ad closes with the graphic: "John Kerry: Wrong on defense."

The Facts 

The ad highlights Kerry's perceived inconsistency on the Iraq issue - long a problem for his campaign - while depicting him as soft on defense.

Kerry voted for the October 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. Last fall he voted against Bush's $87 billion request to pay for continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The request included money for body armor, combat pay and health benefits for reservists and National Guard soldiers who were on active duty.

While the ad implies these were separate votes, the information is based on one vote on the entire $87 billion package, which passed the Senate 87-12. Kerry defended his vote by saying Bush had managed the war badly by not gaining international support. "The way you support the troops is to guarantee we do this right," Kerry said at the time.

He supported an amendment that would have paid for the bill by eliminating some of Bush's tax cuts. That amendment was defeated.

Kerry's campaign issued a rebuttal Tuesday saying the Bush administration has proposed cutting veterans' benefits and citing a long list of increases in defense spending, military pay and benefits that Kerry supported.

Headline: Injection execution method challenged
Author: Sharid Durhams/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
RALEIGH, N.C. - Death penalty opponents have gained allies by highlighting unprepared defense lawyers, withheld prosecution files and DNA evidence. Now, they're returning to their most basic question: Are executions inhumane?

Their arguments that inmates might experience intense pain by lethal injection have helped delay executions in North Carolina and two other states in the past three months. Lawyers have filed similar challenges in at least eight other states.

The challenges pose questions about lethal injection that might not be resolved until the U.S. Supreme Court acts this summer. Even that isn't likely to settle the issue, court watchers say.

North Carolina corrections officials argue that lethal injection provides for a "quick and painless death," and they say critics can't prove otherwise.

Foes of lethal injection don't have examples like electric-chair opponents had in Florida in 1990 and 1997, when smoke and flames could be seen near the inmate's head. But they're compiling affidavits around the country from death-chamber witnesses who believe the twitching they've seen during lethal injections is a sign of agony.

"Lawyers everywhere who are filing an appeal - even if they have other issues - would put this (argument) in," said Richard Dieter of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.

The claims follow the pattern of the last 100 years, in which executions have evolved from hangings to shock to injections in the arms, in an attempt to find the least painful way to execute a killer.If the recent arguments follow history, changes may come before the nation's high court makes a final decision on whether lethal injection is constitutional. The 38 states that allow executions have often stayed a step ahead of courts when the public has become concerned about whether they're cruel.

North Carolina made its latest change after Fountain Odom, a former state senator from Charlotte, N.C., watched the gas execution in 1994 of killer David Lawson, who pulled against his restraints as he died, screaming: "I am human!" 

Four years later, the state stopped giving inmates the option of gas executions, making injection North Carolina's only method of capital punishment.

South Carolina allows prisoners to choose between lethal injection and electrocution. That state has no pending challenges to injection as a method.

Here's how executions are supposed to work in North Carolina: Prison workers inject a first drug, sodium pentothal, which puts the inmate to sleep. A second drug, potassium chloride, stops the heart. A third, pancuronium bromide, paralyzes the inmate. 

Then follow-up doses of the potassium chloride and sodium pentothal finish the procedure. Most states use the same drugs.

The dispute centers on the first drug. Doctors say the second and third drugs would put a patient in agony - like having lightning in your veins - but the sodium pentothal makes sure the inmates don't feel a thing.

"It seems highly unlikely - extremely unlikely - that any person would be awake or aware," said Dr. John Booth, a Duke University Medical Center anesthesiologist, noting the sodium pentothal used is about 10 times the amount used in medical procedures.

Lawyers for the inmates disagree, as do doctors who have backed them. Because of ethical concerns, doctors don't administer the drugs. Prison workers do, and the lawyers argue the workers lack the training to know whether they've injected the first drug correctly, or whether it's working.

Deborah Denno, a Fordham University law professor who published a 2002 study of execution methods, agrees with that assessment and adds that most of the other 37 states that execute criminals don't go as far as North Carolina in saying how much of each drug should be used. 

"There is a lack of sophistication about how this is being done," she said.

Lawyers with the Center for Death Penalty Litigation in Durham argued in a September case that state law doesn't allow for some of the drugs used in executions. In a January case they made arguments about the potential pain involved. They also took affidavits from witnesses that describe North Carolina inmates whose necks were pulsing and chests lifting from the gurney as they were dying. 

Judges granted stays on both cases that were overturned days later, and the inmates were put to death.

The Durham-based lawyers made a successful claim in a third case two weeks ago that's more similar to the one before the U.S. Supreme Court. That latest inmate, George Franklin Page, would have had a painful medical preparation before death. When some inmates have been sick, as Page had been, or overweight, prison workers have to cut into their arms to find a vein.

This "cut down" procedure was to be used in the Alabama case that the Supreme Court agreed to hear and has led to stays in Virginia and New Jersey. North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper decided not to challenge the stay.

The Supreme Court ruling, expected in June, will be on a procedural question about the pain issue and won't settle whether the executions are unconstitutionally cruel, according to experts who observe the court. 

But a signal from the justices could prompt lawmakers to act before the court does.

That's how the gas chamber became more widespread in an era of electric chair executions and how lethal injection eventually became the method offered by every death penalty state except Nebraska, which offers only electrocution.

Injection "was represented to us as a painless and quick way to execute a human being as opposed to the agony of dying by the electric chair or the gas chamber," said Odom, who supports the death penalty but questions whether it's administered fairly.

That issue could enter the debate in May, when the North Carolina House decides whether to consider a two-year moratorium on executions.

If North Carolina's drug combination is threatened by the court, the state could seek other drugs that don't garner the same complaints. It will be up to the medical experts, Odom said, to advise lawmakers on whether there's a better alternative.

Headline: Tuition for incoming freshman will not increase
Author: Susan C. Thomson/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Freshmen at Southern Illinois University's two campuses this fall will pay sharply higher tuition than students there are paying this year - and more than any of their fellow students will be paying next year. 

But the freshmen will get something no other SIU student has ever had - a guarantee that their tuition will hold steady for four straight years.

All Illinois public universities must make such tuition guarantees to freshmen beginning this fall under the state's new Truth in Tuition law.

At a meeting in Carbondale, Ill., on Thursday, the university's Board of Trustees set the guaranteed four-year rate at $4,920 at Carbondale. They set the guaranteed four-year rate at $4,020 at Edwardsville, increases of 16 percent and 20 percent, respectively.

Continuing students, meanwhile, will see their tuition go up 7 percent next fall - to $4,560 at Carbondale and to $3,600 at Edwardsville. 

Those students, unlike the freshmen, will remain subject to annual increases, estimated by SIU officials to range between 7.1 percent and 8.5 percent in the following two years.

Projections show the guaranteed four-year rate for freshmen rising 7.5 percent next year - to $5,310 at Carbondale and $4,320 at Edwardsville - and 8.5 percent the following year -  to $5,760 at Carbondale and $4,650 at Edwardsville.

The law requires universities to guarantee tuition only to freshmen from Illinois, but SIU also will guarantee it to freshmen from out of state.

Out-of-state students now pay double the in-state tuition. 

Beginning the next fall semester, new nonresidents will be charged two times the in-state rate.

Two FIU students were arrested by a team comprised of Miami-Dade policemen and U.S. Secret Service agents on the morning of March 9. The students are accused of taking $480,000 from a financial institution.The arrests were the culmination of a joint, year-old investigation by the Miami-Dade Police Department and the U.S. Secret Service.

Titorian Freeman, a wide receiver for the Golden Panther football team in 2002, was arrested outside the FIU Fitness Center while the second student, Andres Fallon, was apprehended at his home, 15124 S.W. 142nd Pl.

Fallon declined to comment and Freeman could not be reached.FIU administrators are staying tight-lipped. Paul Gallagher, a vice president who oversees the athletic department, and Rick Mello, the athletic director, both declined to comment.

Mello, who was unaware of the incident, confirmed that Freeman was not on the active roster for the football team's 2003 season.

Whether Fallon and Freeman will be taken back into custody is stil uncertain; both are currently out on bail.

Headline: Madrid in Shock
Subheadline: FIU students feel effects of Spanish terror bombings
Author: Joel C. Marino/Assistant News Editor
&nbsp;
The gruesome images were quickly beamed around the world: the twisted metal that formed part of the mass wreckage; the bloodied faces in the morning light; the  sudden anguish of families and friends; and, inevitably,  what became the anger of an entire nation.

The reactions to the Madrid railway terrorist attacks, which resulted in the deaths of around 200 civilians and injuries to 1,500 more have been the focus of global sympathy since the event took place in the early hours of March 11.

For FIU student Ryan Giralt Bedford, an international relations major, the attacks reached him at a more personal level. Born in Barcelona and of Spanish descent, Bedford has been living in the United States since age four and frequently returns to his home country.

"Yeah, I was sad," he said. "I didn't watch it on television, but I found out after a friend told me."

Like many of his countrymen, Bedford admits that his first reaction was to blame ETA, the Basque separatist group that has claimed 800 lives in the past four decades. Indeed, the Spanish government itself initially took this stance, with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar himself pointing fingers just hours after the incident.

"After doing research, I saw that the attack didn't seem like ETA's style. I wasn't surprised when I heard al-Qaeda might have been involved," Bedford said.

ETA denied the charges, a rare occurrence for a group known to take pride in its terrorist activities.

Al-Qaeda was soon placed as the main suspect when an undetonated bomb taken to a police station had its cell-phone activated gears linked to suspected Moroccan and Indian nationals on Saturday. 		    Spanish authorities have arrested a Moroccan named Jamal Zougam, suspected of having ties to al-Qaeda. In 2003, Zougam was also under police scrutiny in Morocco and France, according to the New York Times.

The attack seems to have cost Aznar's government heavily. The ruling Popular Party was ousted from power, making way for the ascension of a Socialist Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in last weekend's elections.

Polls had already shown that almost 90 percent of Spaniards disapproved of the Aznar supporting role in the controversial U.S.-led campaign against Iraq.

Despite these political upheavals, many who might either call themselves Spanish or Spanish expatriates or are planning to visit one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations within the coming months remain resolute in their goals of returning.

The FIU Honors College, which has for 11 years taken students to Spain for various study abroad programs, is no different, assuring students and their parents it was monitoring the political situation very carefully.

Director of Student Services Sharon Placide argued that as the College's faculty has developed and  maintained strong connections with many colleagues in Spain, most felt dismayed by the unexpected  occurrence.

"If it becomes evident that the safety of our students and our faculty and staff is no longer assured, we will make the necessary adjustments," she writes via e-mail.

On the morning of the incident itself, the Office of International Studies at FIU immediately put emergency procedures into place, contacting all FIU students who are currently in the foreign country. 

All were safe.

However, after much deliberation and discussion, those in charge of the program decided that, for the moment, there was no reason why the events should be cancelled, confident that despite the current political environment, the safety of the students remains assured.

Even the sudden change of government remains no obstacle, Placide said. 

She has told students and their parents that "Spain has a stable democracy that has 'changed hands' very peacefully for many years.

Bedford, who has been thinking of returning to his country for months, completely agrees with such resolutions and considers them in the light of both determination and solidarity.

"I didn't get to call my family after the attack, and I really feel I should be talking to them or knowing what they're doing," Bedford said. "I'm going back in a couple of months. This has not deterred me at all---it makes me want to go more, to show my support for my country. I won't be scared to go back home."

Headline: Legal Marijuana
Subheadline:  
Author: gsarm002@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
I was really surprised when I read the article on legalized marijuana. I can't understand how some people believe legal marijuana can benefit our economy. I'm not against right to privacy nor freedom of choice but America, though self-sufficient and advanced, still needs norms and principles to keep the order on society. I don't think just because drugs seem to always find a way into our country we should just open the door for them.
Americans like to be independent and think of themselves as smart individuals who can make the right decisions but we can't refuse to follow the laws that have brought us here in the first place. Everybody knows people don't like to be forced to do something they don't want to do. So if your 5-year old kid asks you to let him go out at night ARE YOU GOING TO LET HIM?
While the idea of "legal marijuana benefiting economy" sounds great we should ask ourselves who says so? Economists? Well, when are we going to start taking some control and stop economists from running our country?

You know, there's a certain vocabulary that's used for special occasions such as sporting events, presidential speeches from George W. Bush, and and even when talking about the rotting tuna sandwich at the bottom of your trash can that I can use in this letter to our Editor in regards to the group of geniuses that come up with the traffic management strategy for our friendly (but irritating) neighbor, the Dade County Youth Fair.  If I used these words, I wouldn't see the day when this letter would make the page.  

On Tuesday, March 30th, I drove my car from the 117th Avenue entrance to FIU, passed the stadium, passed the Performing Arts Center, towards parking lot B (Between the North Parking Garage and the FIJI house) only to be told that I couldn't just make a simple left turn into Parking Lot B. 

I had to exit to 107th Ave, make a U-Turn, go in through the main entrance, realize that the enrance to LOT B was also blocked from that angle, go around the sculpture, BACK on to 107th Ave, in through the same back entrance I came out of initially, and finally into LOT B, all while being insulted by a Fair employee AND paying PARKING FEES to the university who gives you a citation for hurting it's officers' feelings.  Oh, and by the way, I also pay to live on campus.  Maybe students should be urged to live off campus for some time while the FIU Police and the Department of Parking and Traffic take courses that teach them how to RESPECT and TREAT A CUSTOMER of this university.

I know they have a difficult job that requires they carry their balls in a show-and-tell bag at all times, but too often they, along with their 18 year old interns in shiny plastic badges and baggy shorts, have gone too far and shown me and a number of my class mates undeserved disrespect.  THAT IS NOT WHAT WE PAY FOR.

The students, faculty, and staff of this university are what make it a fine nationally-recognized institution.  I'm proud to be an FIU student, but there are things that need to change.  THIS PARKING ISSUE IS ONE OF THEM.
