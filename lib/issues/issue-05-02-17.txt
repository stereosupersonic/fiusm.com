Headline: 'vagina monologues' tackles 
controversial issues and sweeps fiu with three sold out performances
Author: Julia Frajlich / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The women in FIU's production of Eve E nsler's "The Vagina Monologues" are a strong, unified group who believe they can better the world by spreading the word about women's rights. 

Hopefully, students and faculty saw "The Vagina Monologues" this past weekend, because the actors' powerful performances transcended age, gender, sexuality and background. 

Imitations, such as "The Marijuanalogues," have been made from Ensler's book-turned-play, but most don't carry the same message. 

FIU made its own production of the show to promote awareness of safe sex, violence against women and the causes of rape. 

Before the show, audience members were given free condoms and brochures with phone numbers on them to call for more information. 

Most monologues showcased a sense of humor, but there were some that left viewers with a tear in their eye.

Realization seemed to be a key factor during the performance as audience members, including some men, began to relate to some of the stories. 

Sadness accompanied vivid stories of mistreatment and rape.

The basic goal of "The Vagina Monologues" was to invite women to have a better understanding of their vaginas. According to the monologues, most women haven't even looked at their own vaginas, let alone paid attention to them. 

Overall, the acting was superb, even though not all of the cast members were theater majors. The women seemed to be very into their roles, and it really felt as if they were experiencing their specific monologue.

After the show, the cast participated in a question-and-answer session during which audience members asked them why they decided to be involved in the production. 

Most answered that they were searching within themselves for a way to help women. The cast retold the different stories of women through monologues that focused on those women's experiences with their vaginas. 

Eve Ensler's movement of women's rights awareness continues through the Women's Studies Center's "The Vagina Monologues." 

The people of Miami were able to hear the stories of different women. 

Something was celebrated that most women don't often ponder - vaginas. Hooray for the vaginas!

Headline: New play will keep you on edge
Author: Elena Santalo and Michelle Ferrer / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
With not much more than a desk, a chair and a woman on the stage, the play begins. "This is the last day of my life," says poet Sylvia Plath (Angelica Torn). 

We follow Plath through events in her life, that culminate on Feb. 11, 1963, the day she succeeds, after one failed attempt, in committing suicide.  

Writer Paul Alexander's direction was perfect, his script beautifully written. Alexander's use of language had me hooked from the start until the climactic end. Alexander, the author the major Plath biography, "Rough Magic," has had "Edge" in the works for 10 years.

The play, performed at the tiny Coconut Grove Playhouse, is charming. With only a small platform for a stage, the quaint playhouse creates an intimate atmosphere, making the play that much more enjoyable. Since the audience is so close to the actual stage, you feel physically closer to the actress, as well as emotionally. 

This one-woman show is captivating not only because of the intimacy with the audience, but also because of the superb acting. Torn does an amazing job of getting into the mind of the poet. Through her we see Plath's ever-changing emotion. We are taken through a spectrum of feelings ranging from rage and jealousy to love and lust.

We were able to relate to Plath on many different levels due to Torn's acting and as Plath is about to commit suicide in the last few moments of the play, we are able to empathize with her. The audience understands why Plath chooses to end her life. We felt as if we were one of her friends-watching, but powerless.

"Edge" runs through March 26 at the Coconut Grove Playhouse. For information on tickets and show times, you can call 305-442-4000 or go to the website: www.cgplayhouse.org.

Headline: 'Hitch' shows guys how to woo
Author: Michelle / Life! Editor Ferrer
&nbsp;
What would you do if someone tapped you on the shoulder and told you they knew the secret to get that special someone to fall in love with you in three dates? 

 If you are one of these distant admirers, the new film,"Hitch," prescribes your cure. It follows the life of Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens, a discreet, professional "date doctor" for lonely, single men who love women they think they can't have. 

"Hitch" is an epiphany film where Hitchens must realize that love "ain't just a game" and that sweet-talking won't help him win his love du jour, a spunky gossip columnist for a New York tabloid.

Andy Tennant ("Sweet Home Alabama") directed "Hitch" with a perfect sense of comedic timing. 

It is also exquisitely filmed, from its crisp use of color - not only in terms of costume, but also the set itself - to the clean sexiness of its cinematography. 

Panning camera angles give the film a sleek, sharp look, making it pleasing to the eyes, while off-camera voice-overs provide funny commentary.

Lead actor, Will Smith ("I, Robot") keeps you laughing from start to finish alongside co-stars Eva Mendes ("Once Upon a Time in Mexico") and quirky misfit, Kevin James ("50 First Dates"). 

Smith does not disappoint in "Hitch" and will have you agreeing with, if not teaching, his theory on how to woo the ladies by the end of the movie.

While the film is a formulaic romantic comedy, it is entertaining. Written by Kevin Bisch, "Hitch," while as cheesy and cliché as can be, ranks among romantic comedy classics like "10 Things I Hate About You," "Never Been Kissed" and "She's All That." 

Running at a 115 minutes, "Hitch" is worthy a see and a cute date movie.

Headline: U.S. papermakers struggle to compete with China's mills
Author: Frank Greve / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Americans are recycling paper at an all-time high, recapturing 300 pounds per person each year. That's about half the paper produced in the United States.

In addition to improvements in the tactics of waste-paper collection, recycling is gaining from China's suddenly ravenous appetite for U.S. scrap paper. Its hunger for recycled paper is fueled by its own shortage of wood pulp and a mushrooming need for boxes in which to ship its exports.

U.S. papermakers, who need scrap themselves, are struggling to compete against China's mills, which made off with about 6 million tons of American scrap paper in 2004. That's from a total U.S. paper recovery of about 50 million tons. Mills in India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea also are ardent bidders for American scrap paper.

"American mills are scared. They're pulling out their hair," said Mark Arzoumanian, the editor of Official Board Markets, an industry price newsletter.

"It's as though we're a Third World country, providing raw materials to manufacturing countries," fretted Stanley Lancey, an economist at the American Forest & Paper Association, a Washington-based industry trade group.

Recovery rates are steady but prices are soaring for other U.S. recycled products, mainly fibers, metallics and plastics, said Jerry Powell, the editor of Resource Recycling, a monthly magazine for municipal recyclers. "China's key to all three," Powell said.

Exports of U.S. scrap of all kinds grew to $8.4 billion last year, according to the Commerce Department. That's more than double the 1999 total.

Scrap paper is now the top American export by volume, according to the paper industry. It's growing faster than traditional U.S. exports such as advanced technology products, farm products, manufacturing, and goods and services.

What's keeping U.S. and Chinese papermakers stocked with scrap is the eagerness of Americans to recycle. Curbside collection, for instance, is up. So is corrugated cardboard collection, especially by grocery and department stores, who have found they can make money on it.

To bolster recycled-paper supplies to U.S. mills, the forest and paper trade group, which has long pushed recycling, aims to recover 55 percent of the paper produced nationwide by 2012. That's far below the rate in Germany and Finland, which recover nearly 75 percent. But it's another big step up for the United States, which recovered only a third of its paper as recently as 1990.

"It's the mind-set now," said Rod Park, the chairman of the Portland, Ore., and Metro Council's Solid Waste Advisory Committee. The eco-sensitized Portland area recovered almost 550 pounds of paper per person last year, thanks to a policy of charging for garbage pickups but not for recycling. By maximizing recycling, homeowners can save $73 to $170 a year on their garbage-collection bills. Targeted pitches to the property managers of office buildings and apartment buildings - and attractive scrap prices - helped, too.

The hardest-to-recover paper remains printing-writing paper and office paper, as well as the kind that catalogs, magazines and newspaper inserts are printed on. Homeowners will pitch them in, Portland discovered, but only if given additional 14-gallon recycling bins or bigger wheeled ones.

The demand for scrap paper in China, which is so deforested that it produces little of its own pulp, is growing at about 50 percent a year, according to the paper industry. To meet that demand, U.S. collection agents for China's mills offer higher prices than many American papermakers, market analysts report.

Because shipping costs relatively little - $10 to $15 on scrap paper that costs around $100 a ton - China's surging demand is turning even East Coast cities such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Savannah, Ga., Baltimore and Philadelphia into paper-export ports to Asia. Los Angeles leads, followed by New York, San Francisco and Seattle.

Much U.S. scrap paper ends up in the massive new Nine Dragons recycled paper mill in Dongguan, China, north of Hong Kong. It's the world's largest, and is unique in its ability to turn low-quality mixed papers into respectable paperboard for boxes and packaging.

Another factor in China's favor: Its workers, who are paid about $3.40 a day to sort mixed paper manually, are far cheaper than American workers, who are paid at least the $5.15 an hour federal minimum wage. China's low wages have helped many U.S. communities to collect recyclables with little or no sorting.

While strong offshore demand helps keep supplies up and prices in the $80 to $120 a ton range, some environmentalists worry that U.S. mills are getting priced out of recycled paper.

"I don't object to exporting some of our recovered paper overseas," said Susan Kinsella, the executive director of Conservatree, a San Francisco-based forest conservation and paper-recycling group. "At the same time, I think it's important to continue to support our own mills, too."

Headline: North Korea declares it has nuclear weapons, rejects talks
Author: Tim Johnson / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
North Korea's declaration on Feb. 10 that it possesses a nuclear weapons arsenal and will drop out of talks on giving it up sent the United States and its partners searching for a way to re-engage with the autocratic and isolated regime.

The North Korean claim came as Knight Ridder Newspaper learned that the U.S. intelligence community six months ago raised its estimate of the size of North Korea's nuclear arsenal to between two and 15 bombs.

The lower assessment came from intelligence analysts at the Department of Energy, caretaker of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, while the higher number came from the Defense Intelligence Agency, said U.S. officials, who requested anonymity because the estimate is classified.

The U.S. officials, however, cautioned that the numbers weren't based on hard evidence, but on assumptions based on such factors as the quantity and quality of North Korea's highly enriched uranium.

The previous classified estimate put the number of North Korean nuclear weapons between two and nine.

The United States, Japan, South Korea, China and Russia have been urging severely impoverished North Korea to return to talks aimed at getting it to dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and economic assistance.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the North Korean announcement was "a most unfortunate move, most especially, probably, for the people of North Korea." She urged North Korea to reassess its decision to pull out of the talks, saying a withdrawal "only deepens North Korean isolation from the rest of the international community."

Rice, in Luxembourg, gave no hint of what concrete actions the Bush administration plans to take. Washington will consult with North Korea's neighbors in northeast Asia, she said. Rice plans to meet with the South Korean foreign minister on Monday.

"We are confident ... that the United States and its allies can deal with any potential threat from North Korea. And North Korea understands that," she said.

North Korea didn't back up its nuclear assertion, and some experts said the nation might be trying to up the ante in the crisis as a ploy to increase its bargaining leverage. It has used brinkmanship before.

In its statement, North Korea's foreign ministry decried what it called Washington's "wicked nature" and "hostility" and lashed out at Rice, who called Pyongyang an "outpost of tyranny" during her confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill last month and has been in Europe this week sternly warning Iran about its secret nuclear programs.

The North Korean government said the Bush administration still seeks to topple the one-party Kim Jong Il regime.

"This compels us to take a measure to bolster its (North Korea's) nuclear weapons arsenal in order to protect the ideology, system, freedom and democracy chosen by its people," the statement said.

North Korea said it would suspend its participation in the six-party talks "for an indefinite period till we have recognized that there is justification for us to attend the talks and there are ample conditions and atmosphere to expect positive results."

Rice rejected North Korea's assertion that the United States is pursuing an increasingly hostile policy.

"The North Koreans have been told by the president of the United States himself that the United States has no intention of attacking or invading North Korea," she said.

One new development that could add urgency is new evidence indicating that North Korea may be more actively involved in nuclear proliferation than previously thought.

The Bush administration this month dispatched an Asia affairs specialist on the National Security Council, Michael Green, to present the evidence to the governments of China, South Korea and Japan.

Some, but not all, U.S. intelligence analysts believe North Korea supplied Libya with large quantities of partly processed uranium, known as uranium hexafluoride, which can be further processed to produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear bomb fuel, according to an Asian diplomat in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the nuclear talks.

Canisters that carried uranium hexafluoride were surrendered by Libya and contained radioactive trace material that scientists at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee identified as North Korean plutonium.

In addition, A.Q. Khan, the nuclear scientist who headed the Pakistani weapons program and ran an international nuclear materials smuggling ring, gave evidence that the North Koreans exported the material. Finally, scientists were unable to match the distinctive chemical tracings of the Libyan-processed uranium to any known source. Since nearly all-potential sources of the chemical can be identified, by process of elimination, North Korea emerges as a likely, but not necessarily the only, source. There's no record of the chemical signature of North Korean-processed uranium.

Headline: Bush plan cuts college funds for the poor
Author: Becky Bartindale / Knight Ridder Newspaper
&nbsp;
For nearly 30 years, thousands of low-income students who aspire to being the first in their family to attend college have made their way to San Jose State University for help through Upward Bound.

Now, President Bush's proposal to eliminate federal funding in 2006 for Upward Bound and other key college outreach programs has educators worried that some of those students will miss out on a college opportunity.

Upward Bound works through universities, including Stanford and National Hispanic universities, and community agencies. It assists students in schools with high poverty rates who are low-income or who would be the first in their family to go to college.

"These programs are critical because school districts like East Side are cutting counseling and library services, so a lot of our outreach personnel are being reduced due to the current budget crisis," said Art Darin, chief academic officer for the East Side Union High School District in San Jose, Calif.

Darin said loss of the federal programs would mean the students who need help the most may not get the information about or access to college they need.

Upward Bound was created as part of President Johnson's "War on Poverty." It provides students with intensive college preparation. At San Jose State, Upward Bound serves 150 students a year. Since San Jose State began tracking students in 2001, 100 percent of the Upward Bound participants have graduated from high school, 95 percent entered some kind of postsecondary education and 71 percent graduated from college within six years, said Frank Castillo, interim director of pre-college programs.

Upward Bound "opened my eyes to see how important college was and what I needed to get there," said Lizeth Sanchez, 23, a San Jose High Academy graduate who is now a graduate student in recreation management at San Jose State.

Campuses study to make the grade

It's a tricky proposition, college educators say: holding institutions accountable for the quality of graduates they produce.

But college administrators know state and federal regulators increasingly expect proof that public higher education funds are well spent. Accountability has become a buzzword among lawmakers nationwide.

In an attempt to prove their worth to themselves and others, campuses across the country have started testing students to see if they are learning to think in college. About 60 colleges and universities are using the Collegiate Learning Assessment, run by the New York-based Council for Aid to Education, to test freshmen and seniors for critical-thinking and analytical skills.

The tests use two essay questions from the Graduate Record Examination, normally used to gain admission to graduate school. Administrators plan to compare scores of freshmen and seniors.

Educators say they need to do a better job of showing why public colleges are good for the economy and society as a whole, and the tests are one way to do that.



Music legend upstages young stars at Grammy Awards

An eclectic mix of young entertainers including Alicia Keys, John Mayer, Usher, Maroon 5 and rapper Kanye West collected their share of trophies at the 47th Grammy Awards, but it was Ray Charles who won a leading eight Grammys, all springing from the album of duets recorded just before his death, "Genius Loves Company." That included wins in the evening's two top categories: album of the year and record of the year for "Here We Go Again."

The late singer, who intertwined soul, rock 'n' roll, R&B, country, jazz, big band and blues, also won for best pop album and best pop collaboration with vocals for "Here We Go Again" with Norah Jones, and best gospel performance for "Heaven Help Us All," a duet with Gladys Knight. The night was further accentuated by two musical homages to Charles.

The first touching moment of the night was a toast to Charles, and it came early in the show. Keys was joined by Quincy Jones and Jamie Foxx, who portrayed Charles in the bio-pic "Ray" and is up for an Oscar later this month for the performance. Foxx and Keys played piano and sang a Charles signature hit, "Georgia On My Mind."



Prince Charles to wed Camilla Parker Bowles 

The plan was for a calm and dignified announcement, but it soon became a royal scramble Thursday after a tabloid newspaper scooped Buckingham Palace and exposed one of Britain's best-kept secrets: Prince Charles will marry his lover of 34 years, Camilla Parker Bowles, on April 8.

With the abrupt announcement by the prince's office at mid-morning, the royal family revealed its plans to break with centuries of protocol and have the couple wed in a civil ceremony in Windsor Castle rather than a union consecrated by the Church of England.

The decision to keep the marriage out of the church means the heir to the British throne will exchange his wedding vows before the borough registrar of the decidedly working-class London suburb of Slough. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, welcomed the wedding announcement with a terse statement in which they expressed their "warmest good wishes for their future together." At a later public appearance, the queen declined any comment.

Although the queen finally acquiesced to the marriage, the royal family has stipulated that Parker Bowles will not become queen should Prince Charles ascend to the throne and become king. Instead, she will be known as princess consort.

Headline: Teen sex documentary found misleading
Author: Dara Bramson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Every year at least one prestigious journalist wakes up with an earth-shattering epiphany, one so profound that it demands a one-hour television special. This groundbreaking revelation can simply be summed up as: "Wow, American teenagers are slutty!"

 On Jan. 26, Katie Couric hosted a special called "The 411: Teens & Sex." Couric has been co-host of "The Today Show" since 1991, so basically this means she has done this story at least four times. 

These television specials seemingly exist only to scold today's youth and reiterate the obvious, while claiming to "spread awareness." 

This raises the question: Why can't these journalists use their prestige and talent to convey valuable information rather than present the unchanged facts cyclically?	    To her credit, Couric no longer blames teenage sexual activity on Kurt Cobain or gigantic pants and glowsticks. This time, it's "American culture" that's responsible for our attitudes and behaviors. "It's everywhere. It's in advertising, on billboards, in music videos, movies, TV shows," said Couric. She implies that if you do not want to be exposed to sex, you should live in a box.

According to FIU students, there is some validity to Couric's argument.

"I think a lot of the reason some teens are having sex so young is because of what's seen on TV and in music. Sex is being thrown at teenagers from all angles," said junior Alethea Perez. "But if they are doing it responsibly, they should not be criticized for it."

Unfortunately, many Americans act as if they live in boxes. On Couric's NBC special, teens  said that one of the main reasons they were not willing to open up to parents was because of the dismissive attitude their parents took even before the teens revealed any personal information.

 Many parents' attitudes are so insular that their children become too afraid to open up. The gap between our generation and theirs is identical to a language barrier. 

You've probably used the terms "hooking up" or "friends with benefits" before. 

Every generation has its euphemisms, and they are part of what gets the elders into such a tizzy. In the 1920s, parents were terrified of their teenagers going to "necking parties." 

Then those teenagers grew up, had offspring of their own and got nervous when they heard about their kids "doing it" in the backseats of cars. Those words do not necessarily indicate irresponsibility, or any of the other charges leveled at sexually active young adults by "The Today Show." I'm sure even Couric didn't call sex "intercourse" as a teenager.  

We live in an era in which sex-talk borders on mainstream acceptance. 

However, the most influential people in our culture are people like Couric who are stuck in the past. Generally, today's parents come from a time when talking openly about sex  was not an option. 

Couric, a parent herself, told the Associated Press how astounded she was at the nonchalant standpoint many teens have on sex. "I was personally shocked how casually young people treat oral sex, and how it's considered much less intimate than intercourse," said Couric. 

However, during the NBC special, Couric also admitted that sex "needs to be a constant discussion."

Where is the middle ground, if there is one? How can a parent criticize what their children are potentially doing and then encourage them to be open about it?

Whether your beliefs are exceedingly liberal or undoubtedly conservative, it is likely that at one time or another as a college student, you have experienced the ramifications of the close-minded attitude our country has toward sexuality.

Most college students who have a liberal attitude about sexuality have never had to endure being called a "cock-block" or a "prude." 

However, many conservative college students have dealt with criticism for not being "active enough."

Student Brent Capley bemoaned the close mindedness many college students have about sexuality.

"Being a virgin in college is like being an FIU football fan. Nobody knows why you are one. You always get really excited at the beginning of Fall semester only to end up frustrated in the end," said Capley.

It's important to remember this: Teenage sex, done responsibly or irresponsibly, is not something new, and it certainly is not going away. 

It is also important to remember that the only reason these yearly scare reports are produced is because the words "teen sex" mean ratings for the television networks. 

Journalists like Couric are undoubtedly aware that they are reiterating the obvious, but since they are making a lot of money doing it, there is no reason to stop. 

I only wish everyone could have parents like mine, who will not mind reading their child's sex article in the school newspaper.

Subheadline: Closing of gameroom causes controversy
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The Porter Davis Gameroom is a place that most recently admitted students don't know about. The gameroom has been closed since the summer of 2004 and, supposedly, it won't re-open until September. 

If one were to walk by the room it once occupied, they would find wires, cardboard boxes and pool tables wrapped in plastic. Students that have been at FIU for a while notice the room's absence and find it to be a very significant change. It used to be a place where students could relieve the daily stresses of college life.

One might think, "I never enjoyed the room, so why should I care?" What most do not know is that a percentage of tuition fees cover gameroom expenses.

"The money will go for gameroom renovations, including new carpeting, new pool tabletops and even computers for online gaming. Offices from the third floor will be placed in the gameroom until the offices are up to fire code, including remodeling and a new sprinkler system. The new gameroom will be available by September of 2005," said Carlos Carrasco, Director of Operations for the Graham University Center, when asked if students would be reimbursed a portion of their tuition money for a gameroom that is not being used.

FIU seems to be promising many things involving the new and improved gameroom. If it keeps its promises, maybe students will have a space to call their own once again.

Headline: Do not mess with the DJ
Author: John Lovell / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Sitting in the safe confines of our dark and lonely campus radio studio, I get a phone call. Phone calls are great because it's the only way we disc jockeys (DJs) can know if someone is listening or not, so naturally, they make me really happy. I answer the phone and a shrill voice with a thick Miami accent greets me: "Yo, can you play me some Linkin' Park?!"

Argh! I hate being reminded how stupid people are. I can't keep track of how often this happens to me. 

When I'm in the studio, this is no big deal. Usually, I just hang up the phone a little disgruntled and carry on with my play list. You wouldn't believe the frustration I feel when I have to deal with this crap in person.

In addition to DJing at WRGP, I also spin at a club every Wednesday night which hosts an alternative dance party called Deadbeat Club. 

These clubs are relatively new and unique to South Florida, differing from the usual nightclub in their selection of music. The DJs at these clubs spin mostly indie, college or whatever you want to call it - very different music that wouldn't ever find its way into typical Miami Beach clubs, but it is still highly danceable. 

Revolver and Poplife, the two most known of all these dance parties, draw quite a crowd every weekend. The main idea I'm trying to express is that the music I spin is different. 

Contrary to popular belief, most people dislike things that are different. How do I know this? Because, time after time, club-goers waltz up to the DJ booth to make the most outlandish requests for bands like Metallica and 50 Cent. 

It never ceases to amaze me how unaware people are of the genre of music that's being played. If you're in a club that's playing music you aren't familiar with, don't waste the DJ's time requesting Guns `N Roses. For that, you can check out the local Hooters.

I think I speak for DJs of all musical tastes when I say that, in general, people who request music are the most annoying and rude breed of human beings. Fellow DJs, I implore you not to give in to their ridiculous demands! These people are the most selfish and unappreciative people on earth.

Mark my words: If you make the mistake of throwing them a bone and playing the song they asked for, they will only come running back for more, and they'll probably bring a few friends with them. 

Nightclubs are not karaoke bars, and we DJs are not your jukeboxes! 

In fact, there's a fun, little rule I call to mind when Djing: Don't talk to me unless I know you or you're a hot female.  All silliness aside, asking your DJ to play a song for you is a bigger favor than you think.

People don't like being told no. I especially hate how some club-goers get angry when you can't satisfy their request. Whenever someone says, "What do you mean you don't have it?" I know there's going to be trouble. 

There have even been a few times when I thought about reaching for that baseball bat under the booth. As a DJ, you can't  underestimate the stupidity of a drunk and angry club mongrel. 

Another one of my favorite reactions that club-goers have when I turn down their requests is when they ask me what's available instead of whatever garbage they originally wanted. I can't possibly be expected to list everything I have, and there's no way in hell I'm going to allow you to go through my record collection. Once again, unless you either know me or are really beautiful, don't even think about it. 

There is no happy medium or compromise here. I'm really a nice guy, and usually, if you ask nicely enough, I'll consider your request and play it eventually. I just wish there were some standards as to how to treat DJs.

DJs are people too, and it genuinely hurts to see so many people acting idiotically over a crappy song. I fear that eventually, club-goers will no longer tolerate disobedience from DJs and settle for mindless computers and music robots to give them exactly what they want. 

Spinning music is an art, and until people realize and understand that what we do as DJs involves a great deal of skill, we will forever have to ward off drones of selfish requests. 

My advice to those guilty of mistreating your fellow DJ: If you want to hear all your favorite songs and you think you can mix them all together nicely, then you be the DJ.

Headline: FIU wins second straight tournament
Author: Nikolay Orekhov and Harry Coleman / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
It took three days, five games, three total shutouts and several standout individual performances for the Golden Panthers' softball team to win the FIU DeLong Invitational Tournament - their second tournament championship in as many weekends. 

The Golden Panthers capped off the tournament championship with a 2-0 victory over Fordham in the title game on Feb. 13. 

With the win, FIU improved to 11-2 while the losing Rams dropped  to 2-3.  The Golden Panthers have now won their last seven contests and have not given up an earned run in 52 1/3 straight innings.

Head coach Kim Gywdir was proud of her team.

"It's a huge win," said Gwydir. "It's always good to get off to a fast start, especially with a team with a lot of new comers. You are seeing a team grow up right In front of your eyes and playing with a lot of confidence."

FIU's Amanda Nealer recorded two shutouts and three wins during tournament play. The senior struck out a total of 30 batters in 19 innings, and was named to the All-Tournament team along with fellow teammates Lindsay Tippings and Jennifer Powell.

Nealer was also happy about the team's second straight tournament win.

"The win was good for us as a team," said Nealer. "We know what we can do  against good teams."

The performance by Nealer is something Gywdir expects everytime the senior goes out on the mound.

"Her performance is what you expect a senior to do," Gwydir said. "She's done well with her catcher Marleah Stapf calling the plays."

Stapf is the only Golden Panther allowed to call their own game. Nealer is happy that Gwydir has given her that confidence.

"It makes a real big difference. As a pitcher you have different flows and she makes my tempo a whole lot better," Gwydir said. "She knows what I wanna throw. I trust and have faith in her."

Freshman Brook Ruiz was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player after batting .500 with four runs batted in, four runs scored, two stolen bases, a home run and a double during the tournament.

Nealer was proud of the first year player.

"I am so proud of her," Nealer said. "She is such an athlete and I love watching her. She will be great player for FIU in the future."

The Golden Panthers scored their first run against Fordham in the bottom of the third when Tippings led off the inning with a double to left center. She then advanced to third on a bunt single by Cassie Parker, and later scored as she tagged up from third on a Deomni Murray foul out.

FIU added their second and final run of the game on a Ruiz home run to left center in the bottom of the fourth.

The Golden Panthers cruised through much of the tournament, as they defeated Mercer twice, 5-0 and 3-1. FIU then defeated UAB 3-0.

FIU's only contested match came in their first meeting with Fordham, in which the game went into extra innings, as FIU prevailed and picked up the 3-2 win. 

Ruiz led off the bottom of the eighth inning with a walk-off RBI double to right center to send Murray (who had been placed at second according to international tiebreak rules at the start of the inning), home with the game-winning run.

Next the Golden Panthers will travel to San Diego State on Feb. 17-20 to compete in the Campbell/Cartier Classic. FIU will play host to San Diego State, Long Beach State, Oregon State, Santa Clara and defending champions UCLA.

Headline: Men pick up second straight Sun Belt win
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Head coach Sergio Rouco received a nice gift Valentine's Day - another Sun Belt Conference victory.

In front of 614 screaming and cheering fans at the Pharmed Arena on Feb. 14, Ivan Almonte once again proved why he deserves a spot on the Sun Belt All-Conference team by leading FIU with a 68-52 win over Arkansas State.

The junior from the Dominican Republic notched his 11th double-double of the season in a dominating performance on both sides of the court, finishing with 25 points and 12 rebounds. 

Following the game Almonte was his regular self, a true team player. 

"It's not about my performance. It's about everybody. I think everybody played well together," said Almonte. "We need to try and win as much as we can. It's not just about now. It's about who is hotter when the tournament time comes." 

The Golden Panthers never looked back after leading by seven at the half.

Rouco's men started the second half on a 20-8 run, led mostly by Almonte who had 12 points in the first period but another 12 during that run. 

Following the win, Rouco was just as humble about Almonte's performance as Almonte was.

"He was okay. He is our leader, the guy that makes us go," said Rouco. "All the shots that we get are off [Almonte] dumping the ball off of double teams. He is becoming a much better offensive player, and it is a role that he has never been comfortable with, but he is getting there."

 FIU cruised to the finish, controlling the clock for the remainder of the game and for what seems like the first time this season, put a team away in the second half. 

Rouco also praised the team's performance on a night where he managed his first conference winning streak at home. 

"We had an outstanding performance for a team that doesn't have many wins in the conference," Rouco said. "Teams that are not winning, teams where things aren't going well, usually if you are not winners, you roll over. There was no quit in our guys and I am very happy."

Freshmen starter Antonio Jones joined Almonte in double figures by finishing with 10 points. 

Ismael N'Diaye and Junior Matias struggled to find their touch all night. N'Diaye, who added seven rebounds as the Golden Panthers out-rebounded the Indians 42-36, shot just 2-of-8 for six points. Matias struggled in much the same way producing just three field goals off 13 shots, including shooting 0-of-5 from behind the arc. 

Following an early basket by Almonte in the first half, Arkansas State went on a 14-0 run over the following four minutes to take control of the game early. 

The Golden Panthers clawed their way back over the following seven minutes thanks to a 16-4 run that forced an Indian time out with just under 10 minutes to play in the first half, and the score tied at 18. 

Led by the 12 point output of Almonte, FIU took the lead and never looked back, heading into the locker room with a seven point lead, 32-25. 

Isaac Wells led the Indians, a group that was unhappy during the first frame because of calls made by the officials on both offense and defense. The sophomore forward racked up 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting, including a show of some range as he drained a long three-point shot. 

For the first time in what seems like an eternity, the Golden Panthers went into the break with smiles on their faces as they looked to avenge a Jan. 8 five-point loss on the road to this very same Arkansas State team. 

The Indians were hurt offensively and defensively as they missed the output of their team leader J.J. Montgomery who averages almost 20 points a game. In the first meeting between the two clubs, Montgomery dominated the night lighting up the Golden Panthers for 22 points. 

FIU now faces a two game road swing at South Alabama and New Orleans before returning home to close out the season schedule against Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee on Feb. 26 and 28. 

With the win FIU moves to 9-14 on the season and 2-8 in conference, while Arkansas State falls to 13-11 and 5-6 in the Sun Belt Conference.

Headline: FIU ends losing streak with sweep over FAMU
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panther baseball team ended their three-game losing streak with a sweep of FAMU in Tallahassee on Feb. 11 and 12. FIU raised their season record to 4-3.

"This whole weekend we played well. We made plays when we needed to make plays," said senior pitcher David Asher.

In the first game, Asher (2-0) continued his streak of 21 consecutive innings without allowing an earned run. The senior pitched six innings, allowed only one hit and struck out six in the 9-1 rout.

"My guys really helped me out [by scoring seven runs] in the second inning," Asher said. "It's a lot easier to pitch when you have a big lead. You don't get as nervous [on the mound]."

Junior Yahmed Yema led FIU offensively going 3-for-4 with two runs scored and an RBI. As a team, the Golden Panthers had 14 hits in the game.

In game two, freshman Elih Villanueva (2-1) added another solid pitching performance. The starter went six innings, struck out seven, allowed three hits and walked only one batter in a 6-1 victory.

Yema, freshman James McOwen and junior Michael Lopez had two hits each in the 12-hit attack for the FIU.

Game one was blown open in the third inning where FIU scored seven runs. Sophomore Cody Jacobs led-off with a double followed by four consecutive bunts, two singles, a FAMU error and an RBI sacrifice fly by freshman Corey Lozano.

In the fifth, Yema opened the inning with a single and later came around to score on a triple by junior Nick Cadena. Cadena then came around to score off a FAMU passed ball to make it 9-0.

The lone FAMU run came in the eighth inning. A two-out walk put a runner on base. The runner proceeded to steal second base and later scored off an FIU error.

Game two was a 1-1 tie until the seventh inning when McOwen hit a pinch-hit double with a runner on first base. Freshman Michael Jordan, also pinch-hitting, hit a single to left that scored the two runners, making it 3-1.

FIU added one insurance run in the eighth and two more in the ninth.

Senior pitcher Danny Hernandez came out to close in the game in the ninth inning. He allowed no runs with one strikeout for his second save of the season.

The Golden Panthers begin a 23-game home stretch on Feb.   18 at 7 p.m. against LaSalle Stadium.

Record Breaker

Senior  Kevon Pierre  shattered the school record in the 200 meters at Boston University's St. Valentine Invitational over the weekend. 

Pierre  placed third in the 200 and provisionally qualified for the NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships in 21.42 seconds, breaking the school record of 21.78 seconds that he set just three weeks ago at the same track - the BU Track & Tennis Pavillion.

Pierre also beat out a field of 63 athletes to win the 55 meters in 6.34 seconds - just .05 seconds off the school record he set in Boston in FIU's last meet there. The speedy senior is undefeated in the 55 this season.

Women's Basketball Wins

The Sun Belt Conference's leading scorer senior Milena Tomova  poured in a game-high 19 points to lead the Golden Panthers to a 60-55 win over Arkansas-Little Rock to improve to 12-0 all-time versus the Trojans.

With the win, FIU improves to 15-8 overall and 5-5 in the Sun Belt, while UALR drops its third straight to fall to 9-14 overall and 3-7 in the league.

The team returns home to host South Alabama on Feb. 19, at 7 p.m.

Headline: Should the Miami Heat take Zo back? - YES
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Heat needs Alonzo Mourning as much as he needs the Heat.

Don't get me wrong, the Heat have a good team now, but by adding Zo, a proven center who has two Defensive Player of the Year awards under his belt, will make the Heat better.

No player has done more for the Heat franchise than Mourning. The only reason we were a winning team that constantly reached the playoffs was because of Zo.

During his seven seasons in Miami, all he did was build us into a championship contender.

You can't tell him that he's greedy for leaving Miami for a guaranteed $20 million contract. This is a man who must be paid for his services.

Facing many health factors, Mourning needed to leave the Heat and play for a contender. At the time, Miami was rebuilding and the Nets just made a better fit for the possible future Hall of Famer.

Miami needs a better back up for Shaquille O'Neal. When the Big Aristotle gets a breather on the bench, other teams dominate the Heat in the paint. With no capable defensive presence down low, the Heat gets outplayed until Shaq comes back on the floor.

Adding Zo to the team will fix that problem. He will give the Heat the best one-two center combo in the NBA. He will also make the Heat a prominent title contender.

Last years champions, the Detroit Pistons, won the title in part because the team added big man Rasheed Wallace around this same time last season. 

With Wallace complementing Ben Wallace, the team cruised all the way to the championship.

No team in the Eastern Conference has a dominant center other than the Heat and Cleveland. 

Adding Zo will make the Heat twice as deadly. It will also give them a better chance to defeat teams from the Western Conference.

The Heat's current record stands at 39 wins and 14 losses. The record sounds good, however, eight of the losses have come against teams from the West. All of the West favorites - Seattle, Phoenix, San Antonio and Dallas, have defeated Miami.

Miami may be good enough to win the East, but not the NBA title. The team needs better players and Zo's career 19.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and three blocks average per game would be a great start.

Many Heat players have already welcomed the addition of Mourning.

O'Neal and Dwayne Wade were the first to rave about Zo. 

"I think he can help our team. I know he can help our team," said O'Neal.

Added Wade, ''I think Miami would love him. Zo is loved in Miami.''

Zo created Miami basketball and he deserves another chance. He has been a major contributor not just to the Heat, but the entire Miami community. Zo's Summer Groove has raised million of dollars for our city. 

Now, we need to give him the opportunity to come back and finish his career where he belongs - with the Heat.

Headline: Should the Miami Heat take Zo back? - NO
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Never has a man in the sports world epitomized the term "Jekyll and Hyde" like Alonzo Mourning. He has given to the community selflessly and at the same time taken selfishly.

If the Miami Heat want to keep their integrity intact, they should not accept Zo back on the team. This is the same guy who just a year ago, decided that he wouldn't re-sign with the Heat because they were not good enough.

Now I know the guy had a kidney ailment but, what does he do when his contract with the Heat is up? 

Instead of doing the right thing and re-signing with the team who has been loyal to him by paying him millions to sit on the bench, Zo leaves to the highest bidder. 

Of course, most people would take a guaranteed four-year, $20 million contract over a one-year $1.1 million, but he also had the audacity to say he only did it to play toward a championship.

He knew he was in the twilight of his career so he almost literally took the money and ran.

Zo got his payback, however. The sports gods frowned upon his selfish act and the New Jersey Nets, the team he signed with, ended up finishing worse than the Heat did last year.

When this season began, Zo being the diva that he is, demanded a trade from his struggling team. When the team refused, he wanted the team to buy out his contract. 

He only played a total of 30 games for this team! Now he wants them to pay him to leave? He contributed nothing to them.

The sports gods smited Zo again, with a little help from the Nets, this time by sending him to NBA Hell - Toronto. 

In protest, he refused to show up for Toronto's practices and went straight to his Miami home, where he has been ever since.

The argument for the Heat to sign him is that he would play great alongside Shaq. He would defensively solidify the team and help with rebounding. He would also give the team a solid back-up if Shaq were to get into foul trouble.

In a perfect world, that would all be true. However, Zo has played a total of 30 games the past three seasons. He is the recipient of a donated kidney and is about as reliable as a mobile home in Tornado Alley.

In the best case scenario, Zo would be a role player, not the centerpiece he once was. Do you honestly think he could handle playing second-fiddle to Shaq? 

Can he handle watching his former team in the hands of someone else? Something tells me there will be some unrest in the locker room. 

 The Heat is now one of the best teams in the NBA with a good shot of winning the NBA title. 

Even though Zo has helped inner-city youths with the popular "Zo's Summer Groove," it doesn't hide that he has evaded the punishment given to him by the sports gods. 

Zo does not deserve a shot for the championship - at least not with the Heat. If he wants to be here, he should have never left in the first place.

Harry,
I understood your point, however, I disagree with your opinion.  Sad to say, as much as we may feel about the moralality of the issue, professional basketball is still a business.  Although we as fans have personal sentiments toward a professional team and its players, we have to understand that they are not just players but employees of a business.  
Even businesses look out for its best interest.  They didn't just keep Zo for the sake of loyalty.  NBA contracts are guarnteed.  Whether Zo plays or doesn't play, he would've gotten paid.  Even back then, the Heat didn't know the extent of his illness.  Had they known Mourning would never be able to play again, I'm sure they would have arranged a buyout inorder to save on cap space in the future.  However, they did not want to take a risk of buying out Zo's contract to only have a health Zo come back, sign with another team, and torch his former team.  
Let's us look at a different example.  Anthony Carter was the big reason why the Heat was able to turn it's franchise around.  We all know that it was the intention of Anthony Carter's agent not to exercise his option out of the contract.  However, due to the loop hole in his contract, the agent did not give his client's intentions to stay, and Anthony Carter was released.  
The Heat knew it had ability to get away with it legally, so it did what any business would do... Look out for it's best interest.  
So can we honestly say Zo is the bad guy?  He's just a business man conducting business in the 'business world'
