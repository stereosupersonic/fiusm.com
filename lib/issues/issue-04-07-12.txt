Headline: Soccer player Tamara Kochen competes overseas
Author: Natalie Sabia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's very own Tamara Kochen is a unique member of her team due to her overseas experience in Israel.  She recently competed on the Israeli National Team against Kazakhstan on  May 30. 

Her team finished with a 3-1 victory in the contest and won first place in its European Championship qualifying group.  

Israel is now just one victory away from their chance to enter the European Championship in the summer of 2005 if they beat Belaros this September.

As a junior and a major in business-management, Kochen also plays forward for the Golden Panthers and was the first Israeli-born player to play for a U.S. college. 

Playing on the soccer field since she was 4-years old, Kochen was ambitious to join a league as a child, despite the fact that Israel didn't have one available until she was seventeen.  

"As soon as I heard a league was going to open, I got into a club team in a town nearby," said Kochen. Kochen's first game was such a success, the Israeli National team coach, Roni Schnider, ventured to a second game to keep his eyes pealed for any team leaders on the field.  

"He decided to invite me to practice with the national team and I have been part of this team ever since," said Kochen.

Growing up in the small town of Kfar-Silver, Kochen's only open window to meet friends was to play soccer.  

"It's a very small place, you can't even call it a town," said Kochen. 

Born and raised there, because of her father's job at a local high school, Kochen simply grew to love and respect the only true thing she looked forward too: soccer.

As a Golden Panther last season, Kochen finished with 1 goal, 1 assist and 3 points.  She leads her team with a .028 shot percentage and is the fourth in points with a total of 3.

According to coaches, Kochen, is a very fast and skillful player.

She attended the University of Missouri her freshman year, where she played in 15 games and scored two goals. This opportunity was a challenge. 

"My first year was very hard, I didn't speak English at all," said Kochen. Although her stay in Missouri wasn't very long, Kochen quickly made her presence noticed.  

She earned a membership on the Commissioner's Honor Roll for three straight semesters and scored 32 goals as a member of the ASSA Tel-Aviv Team, which won the Israel Women's League Championship.

Headline: Liberals hold lock on leftist film documentaries
Author: Chris Hewitt / Knight Ridder Newspaper
&nbsp;
The documentary boom couldn't have come at better or worse time for the November presidential election, depending on your candidate of choice.

A number of documentaries, most of them politically left-of-center, are heading into theaters. And, just as conservative radio programs haven't generated much liberal radio response, liberal documentaries don't seem to have led to a cinematic response from conservatives.

Leading the charge is Michael Moore, with "Fahrenheit 9/11," the anti-war, anti-George W. Bush film he says he made to affect the November presidential election. "Fahrenheit" earned $23.9 million to become the top-grossing doc of all time in just one weekend of release.

"These are mind-blowing numbers," Moore told journalists. An informal poll of opening-weekend viewers in the Twin Cities suggested that most of them were sympathetic to Moore. 

But the filmmaker cites the box office as proof his movie is influencing the national debate. "All of the predictions that the movie would only speak to the choir, would only be for those who don't like Bush, I don't think have turned out to be true."

"Fahrenheit" isn't the first documentary that takes issue with Dubya - 2002's "Horns and Halos" was largely concerned with uncovering the truth about Bush's alleged drug usage. 

But it is the first movie specifically timed to, as Moore has said, change undecided voters to non-Bush voters. 

Moore, who supported Ralph Nader in the 2000 election, has apparently not picked a candidate this time, but his Web site includes a link to www.NotBush.com.

Others in the wave of liberal documentaries include "The Corporation," which hammers Bush's support of big business (it opens July 9); "The Hunting of a President," which tracks what the movie describes as a right-wing media effort to get former President Bill Clinton impeached (July 30); "Control Room," the anti-war documentary about Arab news organization al-Jazeera (in theaters); "Tying the Knot," which argues in favor of same-sex marriage (no release date set); "Bush's Brain," a critical look at Bush adviser Karl Rove; and two John Kerry documentaries, including one about his service in Vietnam (no release date set).

Moore, presumably, is delighted about all of this. 

He told www.indiewire.com, "If I had a dream years ago, it was that I wouldn't be alone (in making documentaries that advocate political change) and that other people would start doing this. It is really our moment."

What's unclear is how long the moment will last. "There's a worry that, after the election, these films may all be moot," said Eammon Bowles, president of Magnolia Pictures, which is releasing "Control Room."

"I'm really glad we're out ahead of the pack with 'Control Room,' because there are so many of these films, it's like Cinema Against Bush. But when November rolls around, who knows? Who knows what the political or social climate will be on any given day?"

As a key distributor of documentaries, Bowles has seen many of the upcoming films, not all of which are good. He believes their varying quality will determine how much of an impact they have on audiences and on the election. 

Meanwhile, he said no filmmakers with conservative agendas have approached Magnolia about distributing their films. The sole conservative documentary on Bowles' radar is filmmaker Mike Wilson's "Michael Moore Hates America." (Wilson, who voted for Bush in 2000, considers himself a Libertarian.) But Bowles said, "He doesn't have any footage to show yet."

Why the shortage of conservative voices in nonfiction filmmaking?

Bowles has a guess: "I think maybe the independent film audience, in general, leans more toward personal expression and liberalism, whereas the people listening to the radio might be more conservative."

Headline: Hip-hop artists spread word on healthy diet styles
Author: Leslie Fulbright / The Seattle Times
&nbsp;
SEATTLE - There are some hip-hop artists who don't drink Tanqueray and Alize and want no part of the late-night trips to the BK. 

Take the socially conscious rap duo Dead Prez, whose song "Be Healthy" includes the lyrics: "I don't eat meat, no dairy, no sweets - only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat." 

In recent years, hip-hop artists have started publicly denouncing the unhealthy diets some of their counterparts have long embraced. They are pushing the benefits of holistic health in the black community, where high blood pressure and cholesterol are common problems. 

Singer Erykah Badu, an active promoter of the vegan lifestyle, has been known to stop by Seattle's Hillside Quickies Vegan Sandwich Shop, where the Howell family serves up Tempehstrami Subs and Macaroni and Yease to the tune of hip-hop, dance hall and reggae. 

"We get a lot of artists that come through here," said Ayinde Howell, a 25-year-old vegan and local rapper/poet, "the ones who take care of their bodies." 

The low-key vegan/soul-food cafe has hosted the likes of The Roots, Saul Williams, Black Anger, Blackalicious and the Lifesavas. Howell opened the business five years ago, inspired by his mother, who has prepared wholesale vegan foods for years. 

Sister Afi, 29, came to help a couple years ago at Quickies, where she now handles all of the vegan desserts, including cookies, cakes, pies, bars and vegan soy cream. 

"There has always been cooking going on in our family," Howell said, "so we may as well make money." 

Seattle has strong vegan and hip-hop communities, and Howell is part of both. They don't often intersect. 

"Hip-hop is largely black people and black people are not largely vegans," Howell said. 

"With hip-hop, there is a little bit of machismo, so 'Save the Animals' is not the most popular slogan. 

"But now that the big artists are coming out, they are having some influence." 

At the forefront is rap mogul and entrepreneur Russell Simmons, a strict vegan who is active in People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Simmons has, among other things, signed on to PETA's anti-fur ad in Women's Wear Daily, recorded a radio public service announcement promoting vegetarianism and participated in the PETA Celebrity Cookbook. 

The late Notorious B.I.G., who famously indulged in "T-bone steak, cheese, eggs and Welch's grape" in his classic single, "Big Poppa" - and evidenced by his hefty frame - is probably rolling in his grave. 

But the benefits of going veggie are taking root. A recently released DVD, "Holistic Wellness for the Hip-Hop Generation," speaks to young people about diet and health. Created by filmmaker Supa Nova Slom, the 110-minute documentary features appearances by artists Badu, rapper Common and Stic.man from Dead Prez. 

Meanwhile, vegetarianism is gaining popularity not only in hip-hop but in black communities across the nation. An informal survey of black vegetarians on the Web site www.blackvegetarians.org reveals that the top three reasons given for eliminating meat are health (34 percent), ethical reasons (14 percent) and spiritual or religious reasons (12 percent). 

Such conversions are changing the look of soul-food restaurants that are now trying to accommodate nonmeat eaters. 

Vegans like Common, Outkast's Andre 3000 and Badu are spotlighting what could become a movement for young people. 

Howell hopes hip-hop artists can deliver that message to their listeners. 

As the youngest of three, Howell says his parents' "hippie stuff" started with him. He was born and raised a Rastafarian in Tacoma, Wash., but still has roots and relatives in the South. 

Though his parents are heavily involved in the religion, which promotes living naturally and not eating animals, Howell says it's not easy telling his Southern relatives that he doesn't want any chicken or ribs.

Headline: Fight summer doldrums with inexpensive Miami outings
Author: John Lovell / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Who would've thought that a summer in Miami could be so boring? Being stuck down here isn't as fun as it seems, whether you work a mindless job, take some lame classes or just sit around in your pajamas all day. 

To make things even worse, this isn't simply a summer in Miami; this is a summer at FIU, and unfortunately there aren't very many exciting things going on.

This brings you here, in the dead middle of summer with absolutely nothing to do. That must explain why you're reading this issue of The Beacon, huh? Fortunately, this is your lucky day! 

Here is a roundup of several interesting things to do and places to see this summer. It's all on the fairly cheap side too; we're college students damnit! There are no Bright Futures scholarships in the summer semester.

Food: Dogma Grill, 7030 Biscayne Blvd.

Celebrate the summer sunshine with a hotdog al fresco at Dogma Grill, a tiny oasis on a turbulent Biscayne Boulevard. These aren't ordinary wieners and the "it's a frank philosophy" slogan will suddenly make sense when glancing at the menu. 

"It's a cool atmosphere with friendly people and good food," says Kearen Gattenio, who has been manager of Dogma Grill since it opened a little more than a year ago. 

From Chilidogs to my all-time favorite, their signature Burrito Dog (two franks wrapped in a warm flour tortilla with all sorts of other goodies), Dogma marries the simple hotdog with a wide range of tasty flavors.

After choosing your dog's design, select a frank - either all beef, polish sausage, or 100 percent veggie. The veggie franks are actually better; take it from me - an all around carnivore. Cool down with some refreshing, homemade Mint Lemonade and pick a spot under an umbrella-shaded table. 

It's a decent hike from FIU, but for a  meal of this magnitude, you won't spend more than five or six bones and you'll never look at hotdogs the same way.

Live: I/O, 30 NE 14th St.

There's no doubt that The Cure's highly anticipated Curiosa festival is the concert on everybody's hit list this summer. The only problem is it's an hour and a half away, in West Palm Beach, tacking on even more money to an already steep ticket price. 

Don't sweat the high costs of long distance amphitheater concerts and festivals when there's plenty in your own backyard - or at least downtown.

This month, popular hipster den I/O in downtown Miami will feature several exciting shows with artists and bands that have been stirring interest in the music community. 

On July 22, there's a rock show you won't want to miss with Secret Machines and The Helio Sequence - two bands that are being proclaimed by many as the next big things in rock music. 

Your wallet will thank you, with cover at a very affordable $8 and fairly cheap drinks inside.

Evening: The District, 35 NE 40 St.

Veterans of Poplife, an independent music and dance night, will remember the glory days of the old Piccadilly venue. The club is back as The District, the latest hot spot in Miami's Design District. 

On Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, the restaurant becomes a late night lounge at 11 p.m. with DJ's spinning music and bartenders dealing drinks. 

If you pop in on Thursday nights, you can catch DJ's spinning eclectic mixes of modern pop and rock. 

The night will be akin to the popular Revolver dance night at Soho Lounge (just down the street), only minus the irritating scenester hype. When you tire of the inner restaurant and lounge, catch some fresh air in the outside patio. Each area features a different DJ to keep up a variety of moods. 

With no cover charge and Thursday two-for-one drink specials, The District is quickly becoming favorable in the nightclub community. 

The list continues:

Headline: Famished at FIU
Subheadline: BBC food services cut back hours of operation
Author: Maryanly Hernandez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Students complain that if you're looking for a hot meal at the Biscayne Bay Campus after 2:30 p.m., you're out of luck.

During the summer term, the BBC food court's   Subway, Little Charlie's Pizza and Grille Works will be opened from 8:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.  

After 2:30 p.m., the remaining option is the Oasis, where students can mainly buy coffee, smoothies and pre-packaged sandwiches. The Oasis is opened from 8 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. on Monday through Thursday and until 2:30 p.m. on Fridays.

 Despite complaints that the short amount of hours are not enough to satisfy every student's nourishing needs, those responsible for the decision stand firm behind their choice.

"We'll see maybe two or three people walk by [after closing time]. That's not enough clientele," Paul Bucklin, the BBC supervisor for Aramark, said. 

Aramark is the company in charge of the food services on both campuses.  

Paul Sparks, Aramark's BBC food service director, explained that he and Nicholas Diciacco, the executive director at BBC's business and finance department, determined the food services' hours of operation.  

Sparks said that the factors taken into consideration were the number of students on campus and the amount of revenue.

However, according to the bid contract between FIU and Aramark, the final decision falls on FIU. The contract states that the "contractor agrees to provide food service on days and during hours as required by the university." 

Dr. Paul Gallagher, senior vice president and chief of staff (then executive vice president), whose signature appears on the contract, was unavailable for comment.

"If we are paying for tuition, we should be paying for the accessibility of all services," said Michelle Arean, a senior and communications major who works for FIU but who cannot have dinner before class because her shift lets out after the amenities close. 

Aramark has to pay FIU commission from a percentage of its revenues and a 6.5 percent sales tax.  "We may not make a profit and we still pay the commission to the university," Sparks said.  

"There's nobody really here on campus for them [BBC food court] to stay open and make a profit," Bucklin said.  

Sparks explained that BBC is a retail facility, which offers only a declining balance meal plan.  Without an all-you-can-eat facility offering a fixed cost, BBC is driven by profit.  

Aramark-owned Fresh Food Company, which offers an all-you-can-eat system at University Park, closes at 2:00 p.m. The remaining options are Pollo Tropical, Subway and Java City, all Aramark franchises.  

Edy's, Smoothie Time and Barnes and Nobles Café also stay open.  

After these places close, the student can opt for the Breezeway Café in University Towers, opened until 9 p.m. Monday through Friday and until 7 p.m. on Saturdays.

Bucklin explained that even though there are summer camps each summer, food court employees are laid off because they work with a skeleton crew, the minimum amount of workers needed.  

Despite the current problems, the hours of the Oasis have been considerably altered when compared to last summer, being that the place was not opened at all on Fridays.  

Sparks is also responsible for the food court and the Oasis opening half an hour earlier than last summer's starting time.  

Sparks said that during each semester, food services check the class schedules to analyze how early the earliest classes start and how late the last classes end. This insures that the hours accomodate the majority of students' schedules.

Kevin Cayard, a senior and business major living on campus, said "I have class at two o'clock and 6:25 p.m. and if I can't leave campus I'm stuck eating candy bars out of the vending machine."

Cayard also added, "Driving, traffic, all that stuff just wastes time.  It's a dissatisfaction to the students," referring to students' search for food elsewhere. 

"I would love to be able to offer more variety and more products but I'm limited by my freezer space and my refrigeration," Sparks said. "Our Grille Works and Café Features are monitored by our company's headquarters and we have to bide by its menus and recipes."

According to  Sparks, some students at BBC have found a solution.

"Some students have even taken the shuttle down to South campus and eaten their dinner down there," he said. "They can have a meal plan at UP."

Starting fall semester, food services at both campuses will go back to regular hours. Such food places as The Pizza Hut Express and  Café Features will return to BBC's food court.

For now, each student has to find his or her own solution to the problem.

"Sometimes I bring snacks; sometimes I starve," said Michelle Arean.

Headline: Medical School gains
Author: C. Joel Marino / Asst. News Editor
&nbsp;
After a decade's worth of plans to establish the first public allopathic medical school in South Florida, FIU officially submitted its formal proposal to the Florida Board of Governors on July 8. 

Described as "the next step in a long, hard path" by FIU President Modesto A. Maidique, the proposal coincided with several announcements regarding the future of the highly promoted medical school initiative.

At a conference held in the MARC International Pavilion, the university was presented with a $10 million ceremonial check on behalf of Herbert A. Wertheim, a 15 year member of the FIU Board of Trustees, a donation referred to as "the Wertheim Challenge" by President Maidique. 

The gift was granted in hopes of stimulating enough public interest in the project to raise another $10 million which, when paired with financial support from the state government, would result in a $40 million fund to be used exclusively for medical school purposes.

Along with the grant, the university formally announced a future alliance with four of Miami's most important hospitals (Mt. Sinai Medical Center, Mercy Hospital, Baptist Health and the Miami Children's Hospital), an arrangement which would supply the incoming students with on-the-job medical training and clinical residencies.

"The history of FIU is a history of responding to the community's needs," said President Maidique, introducing the university's reasons behind the initiative as presented by Provost Mark Rosenberg.

Among the facts presented, the one of most importance and urgency was considered to be the major shortage of 200,000 physicians currently being experienced by the state. Of the doctors presently involved in the work-force, 42 percent are over the age of 55 and a quarter of these are older than 65.

Though Florida already sponsors four universities with allopathic medical degree programs, the provost acknowledged the fact that most of the young, graduating doctors have a tendency to find jobs out of state.

"Florida is already importing 80 percent of its doctors," Rosenberg said.

With these facts in mind, FIU officials and their supporters are lobbying for the M.D program as an innovative solution to the dramatic medical work-force shortage.

"If there is a shortage of physicians, it's also true that there's a shortage of physicians who understand the changing multicultural diversity we face," said Rosenberg, referring to South Florida's ever growing immigrant population placed in crisis by the lack of medical staff.

FIU currently holds a Medical Honors program alliance with the University of South Florida and will be, next to the University of Miami, the only school with an M.D. program in the region.

Headline: Football players involved in robbery, held without bond
Author: Harry Coleman / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Three Golden Panther football players arrested on July 3 are still being held in jail without bond.

Everett Baker, Diamos DeMerritt and Randy Arnold are under investigation after allegedly trying to rob two students in an incident that included gunshots being fired.

Of the three students, Defensive Back Baker, 20, faces the most serious charges of the three which include attempted murder for firing into an occupied vehicle, two counts of armed robbery, possession of a weapon on university grounds and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Both Arnold, 20, and DeMerritt, 21, are charged with two counts each of armed robbery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm on school grounds.

DeMerritt also faces felony charges of a concealed firearm and possession of marijuana.

According to the FIU Public Safety Police report, two FIU students were headed to pick up a mutual friend 



t Building K. Located at University Park apartments, Building K is closed to students for the summer, according to the FIU housing department.

Upon arrival, the two students parked southbound of Building K. Within five minutes, five black males approached them wearing bandanas to conceal their identity. 

The driver was ordered at gunpoint to get out of the car twice by one of the subjects.

Thinking the pointed gun was a joke, the driver pushed the firearm away from the subject. At this point, the subject struck the driver on the mouth with a closed fist.

According to the report, after the produced gun and fist to the mouth, the student realized the subjects were serious and accelerated the vehicle.

As they sped off, Baker allegedly fired at the vehicle, shattering the rear left window and penetrating the driver's headrest. 

The driver was not hurt, but the passenger was nearly hit with the bullet, which had penetrated from the driver's headrest.

"It's unfortunate when terrible situations like this occur and of course, we are disappointed and concerned," said Rick Mello, director of Intercollegiate Athletics. "These are serious allegations and after due process is served, the matter will be dealt with appropriately and in accordance with university policy. We will cooperate fully with any and all police investigations."

In the meantime, according to Mello, all three of these young men have been suspended indefinitely from the football team. According to a newsletter sent to the university community by FIU President Modesto A. Maidique, the university has issued a no trespass warrant to the three football players involved in the incident.

FIU police has no information regarding the other two suspects who are still at large. 

According to the arrest report, the incident was caused by a foiled drug deal involving a half-ounce of marijuana. The guns involved in the attack were taken from DeMerritt's car when FIU police arrested him.

The three football players were denied bond in their first court appearance on July 5 and are currently locked up in a Miami-Dade County jail. Their next hearing is set for July 26.

At press time, both of the victims declined comment.

Headline: PantherSoft leaves some students, faculty in the dark
Author: Brenda Adrianzen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's new computerized administrative system, PantherSoft, is gradually becoming implemented university-wide, causing students, staff and faculty to look at the system and gauge its success; so, far the results have been mixed.  

The system is expected to make all university transactions quicker and simpler to process. 

Although PantherSoft will not completely replace the old Legacy system until the end of the summer semester, several departments, including Admissions and Financial Aid, have been using the new system since the spring.

According to Ana Sarasti, director of Financial Aid, her offices have been using the web-based system to correspond with returning students.  

Thus, students have been informed of missing documents or awards they are eligible for without having to wait days or weeks for the information to reach them through snail mail.

"Students can correspond with us quickly.  The system has opened up [several means of] communications between us and the students," Sarasti said.

Still, Financial Aid has experienced some problems. "A disadvantage to the system is that it is data entry intensive," Sarasti said. "For certain transactions we have to use multiple screens where we only used one in the Legacy system."

Furthermore, recalculation of awards has to be done manually and the verification process used for federal aid requires manual interaction.  

"The system has worked well, but not perfectly.  However, I am very pleased with the performance," said Sarasti.

The Admissions office has been receiving undergraduate applications through the system.  There have been errors due to conversion problems that have caused some new students to have to be admitted manually rather than electronically.  The staff has gone through training and is trying to work through the small conversion problems they have encountered.  

Jose Vasquez, a junior and engineering major, believes it will take time for everyone to become comfortable with the PantherSoft system.  

"I know some people who are confused by it.  I'm not exactly sure when I'm supposed to use it or not"

Sarasti agrees that the conversion process has been and will continue to be hectic. Still, she is intent on overcoming the obstacles. 

"I am optimistic the system will affect students in a major way," she said.

Assistant director of Orientation and Commuter Student Services, April Mann, believes that the system is user-friendly.  Although the system has not affected advising for the summer term, peer advisors and staff have used the system in preparation for fall orientation.  

"The best thing about PantherSoft is that it interfaces with different offices within the university," Mann said. 	

University departments are hopeful to get through the problems and make the system a success.

Other departments, such as Registration and Student Financials (formerly Cashier's and Bursar's offices) went live July 6.  

"We have no clue as to what problems will come about, but we'll take it day-by-day," Registration staff member Lino Pico said.

Headline: Why Bush may win next election
Author: Romina Garber / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
I was furiously typing my paper on Hamlet as my friends were sitting around my common room when the discussion on politics turned to the upcoming presidential election.

The question on the table was what way college students would vote. Are more college students supporting Bush? Are more of us becoming Republicans?

Fortunately, my best friend Leslie is in the Institute of Politics here at Harvard, and her committee has just finalized a national survey of college students' political inclinations and how we are likely to vote.

According to the survey, 62 percent of us will be heading to the polls in November, and right now most of us will be voting for Kerry. In the last survey in the fall, most of us supported Bush. Why the change?

Our support for the war in Iraq has dropped from 58 percent six months ago to 49 percent, and Bush's approval rating fell from 61 percent to 47 percent. We also support legalizing gay marriage, which Bush strongly opposes.

"There's been a reaction to Bush's policies and so support for Bush has gone significantly down. The feeling now is anti-Bush, but that doesn't necessarily make it pro-Kerry. Students are reporting they would vote for Kerry just because they are now anti-Bush,'' Leslie said.

"The switch is from being actively pro-Bush to being actively anti-Bush ... now we're the same as the rest of the population,'' she added.

It also turns out we are a very moral generation. Most of us would not vote for a candidate who cheated on his wife, tax returns or resume. It's interesting to compare those convictions to a survey of the total population (not just youth) that shows that less than half care if a candidate has cheated in these areas.

We also are more religious than previous generations, but a majority of us would still vote for a candidate who does not believe in God.

So what does this say about us? Well, for one we're not apathetic. We realize how important it is to elect the government we want.

Two-thirds of us think we will have a hard time finding employment after graduating so we are aching for an administration that we can trust with our futures.

These results make for a very idealistic youth.

Back to the conversation my friends were having. They did not sound very optimistic about Bush and the integrity of his administration.

"'I bet you they find Osama in September,'' one of my roommates said.

"Eh, maybe that's not close enough to elections - probably October,'' chimed in another friend.

The problem, as they see it, is that Bush is making it seem like the terrorists are the source of all of our problems, and that once bin Laden is caught, everything will be perfect. 

While most of us are informed enough to know that this is far from the truth, there is a large part of the population that will be swayed to believe this in September, when this becomes the Republican platform.

Whatever happens, it's good to know that we care and that we will be casting our vote with the rest of the country. Maybe we can give these elections a dose of morality.

Headline: Womens soccer to kick off against rival UCF
Author: Natalie Sabia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Heading into their 20th season, the Florida International University's women's soccer program will enter into one of their most challenging schedules in history.  

Consisting of a pair of conference champions and five NCAA teams, FIU's schedule includes University of Central Florida, from the Atlantic Sun; Denver, from the Sun Belt, Texas, Florida State and Florida.   

The Golden Panthers will return with 13 letter winners from last year, including seven starters.  "I could have made it an easy schedule, but I like challenges," said Head Coach Everton Edwards.

Several new forwards, who could even possibly be new starters, consist of women from various cities and states.  

Newcomers Chanelle Crosby and Whitney Rezendes, who are both from the same high school in Littleton, Colo. are just a few of the fresh faces who will appear on the field.  

Crosby spent two previous years at Northern Illinois, where she was the second-leading scorer her freshman year and played in all 18 contests as a sophomore.  

Another newcomer, a local one, is freshman Sofia Frayle, who was one of the top prep players throughout the Miami area. After scoring 107 career goals, along with 63 assists, she was named All-Dade 6A Girls Soccer Player of the Year.

Among the midfielders, FIU welcomes Julie Mushill, Francesca Chong and Andrea Tarasivk to the team this year.  As her high school's leading scorer with 60 career goals and 33 assists, Mushill was named First-Team All-State recognition and was named twice all-conference.  

Chong was also in the spotlight as a two-time All Dade selection at Felix Varela High School.

The Golden Panthers are secure among their defenders, after the return of five letter winners, along with four talented newcomers.  Maya Ozery, who is among the Israeli National Team, is just one of five players from the National Team venturing to the U.S. to compete on the collegiate level.  

Kristin Hurst, Whitney Perez and sophomore transfer Yaneash Donaldson are also joining FIU as defenders. Hurst was selected first-team All-State as a senior in high school and was recognized as team MVP twice. Perez was named Sun-Sentinel Player of the Year for Class 6A-5A and a four-time All-Area and All-Conference.  Donaldson, who is transferring from Clemson, has competed with several successful teams including high school and college.

After a sad ending throughout the last two seasons, FIU will turn their attention towards a major goal they need to focus on: offense.  In the last seconds of a game when goals were desperately needed, the Golden Panthers were unable to pull through.  "If you get competition within, then you get competition out too," said Edwards.

The Golden Panther's schedule also includes familiar teams such as cross-town rivals University of Miami on Oct. 13 in Coral Gables. "Playing Miami is always a rival for us," said Edwards.

This season kicks off with the first five games away. Their home opener is on Sunday, Sept. 12 against South Florida.  

The Golden Panthers will host the 2004 Sun Belt Conference Tournament beginning on Nov. 5. 

Despite coming in last place in the Sun Belt Conference last year, Coach Edwards is hopeful this year's players will not only carry their team with magnificent strength and ability, but hopes they will be strong throughout the season.  "Life is full of challenges, this will be one," said Edwards.

Headline: High school students attend journalism workshop
Author: Nuola Akinde / Senior Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Hunched over computers or running around the campus hungry for a good story, the high school students attending FIU's Summer Journalism Workshop mixed dedication with fun as they spent their first week of vacation simulating an internship with the Beacon. 

   Created in 1992, the FIU Summer Journalism Workshop was initially a program to introduce minorities to the career of journalism. The free workshop was sponsored by the Dow Jones Foundation and was successful with the help of the Sun-Sentinel, which printed the student-produced paper at the end of the week.  

   This year the program was sponsored by the FIU School of Journalism and was opened up to applicants of any race, increasing the attendance of non-minority students. Nevertheless, the spirit of the program remained fundamentally the same.

   Professor Don Sneed of FIU and Otto Zequeira, a teacher and newspaper adviser at Coral Gables Senior High, were  responsible for the workshop. 

   "Mr. Zequeira is very enthusiastic, organized and always encourages us to give him ideas. He's always receptive," said Paul Greco a student at South Plantation High 

   Professor Sneed has been the facilitator for the past seven years and has worked mostly behind the scenes, making appearances throughout the day. 

       "I'm learning so much and getting a lot of experience. I've learned about digging for stories which is something I've never had to do before. Professor Sneed even showed me how to use microfilm," said Greco. 

   Mr. Zequeira, the workshop instructor, utilized a combination of analysis and practice. He also included yoga moments to soothe the body while rejuvenating the mind.

   "I teach a mixture of reading, writing, speaking and listening, theory and application," he said.              

   Throughout the week, the students were allowed to spread their wings and expand their minds. While Mr. Zequeira kept order, he also encouraged students to do beat assignments, which allowed them to spend time investigating and searching for stories. For most of the participants it was a new and enlightening experience.  

   "In the beginning, I was a bit skeptical. It seemed too complicated. But in the end it proved to be beneficial to find stories on our own without them being given to us," said Jenni Sklar of South Dade Senior High School.  

   The students received copies of the FIU department directory and were given a place to make phone calls. They worked autonomously for a few hours scouring the beat, or school areas, of their choice experiencing the art of true journalism and the frenzy of trying to find a good lead.  The students felt like they were finally living the life of real reporters.  

    "I want to be a journalist because I love meeting people, doing feature stories and writing about things happening in the community. When I first signed up for journalism at school I wondered why, but I got a job at the Herald and ever since then I've stuck with it," said Ileana Morales of Braddock Senior High School.
