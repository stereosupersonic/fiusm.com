Headline: A NAME'S PRICE: Faculty raises funds to rename SJMC after Miami Herald reporter
Author: Christina Lemus / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Two years after the death of Gene Miller, Jane Daugherty found a way to honor the former Miami Herald reporter and editor by starting a fund-raiser to name the School of Journalism and Mass Communication after him.

Daugherty and other SJMC faculty and staff began the fund-raiser on Aug. 21 along with Miller's family and friends. They have helped Daugherty jump start the fund-raising effort to raise the $5 million necessary for a naming license.

Lillian Lodge Kopenhaver, dean of SJMC, supports the fund-raiser.

"I think it would be wonderful for our School of Journalism to be named after Gene because he is symbolic to our school. He was a terrific writer and a mentor to the [FIU] students who were recruited to work at The Herald," Kopenhaver said.

The name change has been approved by Robert Callahan, FIU's associate vice president for development for University Advancement. However, the name change won't happen unless the money is raised. Since the money must be collected from organizations outside of FIU, Daugherty expects most contributions to come from journalists who worked with or admired Miller or foundations that support journalism and education.

Although the fund-raiser is still in its beginning stages, Daugherty said she has already received a $3,000 contribution from a small foundation she contacted.

Daugherty will announce an honorary fund raising campaign committee in a few weeks.

According to Daugherty, the idea of naming SJMC after the 48-year Miami Herald veteran occurred to her after visiting his widow, Caroline Heck Miller, on the second anniversary of his funeral in June.

Daugherty sat in front of Miller in the newsroom of The Miami Herald from 1976 to 1985. She said Miller, who was known for his brand of hard-hitting, fact-filled reporting, helped Millerize several of her stories.

"I remember once investigating a doctor who ran a small hospital in a very poor Miami-Dade community. The guy was receiving millions of dollars in Medicaid payments a year with only a couple hundred patients. [It] started out as a pretty boring Medicaid fraud story. Gene's suggestions turned it into a fascinating piece about an already rich doctor's greed and exploitation of unsuspecting, poor, young women," Daugherty said.

Caroline, a former Miami Herald reporter and current assistant US attorney in Miami, has known Daugherty for many years and also supports the fund-raiser.

"Gene was a doer, not an academic, but he had a deep respect for academic institutions and seeing fine journalists go to The Miami Herald from FIU," Caroline said.

Miller's hard-hitting reporting won him two Pulitzer Prizes. He won the first in 1967 after extensive investigations that freed two innocent people from prison, both who were convicted of separate murders.

His second Pulitzer came in 1976 after eight years of reporting on two Death Row inmates charged with killing two gas station attendants in Port St. Joe, Florida. There was no evidence, only confessions beaten out of the men by police officers. Miller wrote almost all of the 130 Miami Herald articles written about the inmates as well as a book on the subject, Invitation to a Lynching. Miller's investigative reporting resulted in both men being freed.

Miller died of cancer on June 17, 2005 near his South Miami home. He was 76 years old.

Caroline believes her late husband would have been honored to be named for FIU's SJMC.

"Gene was in his late 70's when he passed but was still a person of tremendous energy and youth of spirit [before he died]," Caroline said. "I know he would have loved for a school full of smart-aleck, young journalists named for him."

Headline: Magician, jugglers to be at Fall Fest
Author: David Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For years, Fall Fest has been a staple of the Biscayne Bay Campus' activities to welcome all students.

The event will span four days and will allow students to kick back as the Fall semester begins. 

From Sept. 4 through Sept. 8, the event, organized by the Student Programming Council at BBC, will take place in Panther Square and the flag pole area outside the Wolfe University Center. 

From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. students can take part in carnival-themed activities, enjoy free food, and take in a variety of performances.

"The Fall Fest takes place around this time precisely to let students kick back and have fun as school starts again," said Leatrice Gachette, SPC-BBC secretary. "It is a way to show that FIU cares about making students comfortable as it does for educating them."

 A magician and jugglers will perform Sept. 4, the first day of Fall Fest. 

The following day, animal trainers from Jungle Island will bring parrots and other animals to the school. 

There will also be free giveaways throughout all four days of the event. 

The Panther Power Pep Rally, which will include a dance competition and free food, will take place Sept. 6 at 12 p.m. at the flag pole area.

As part of Fall Fest, the Mary Ann Wolfe Theater will host the first annual FIU stroll-off. Representatives from the school's fraternities and sororities will bring members to perform choreographed pieces and compete for bragging rights.

To conclude this year's Fall Fest, the "LOL" comedy series will start Sept. 7 at 7 p.m. in the WUC ballrooms.

Comedians RedBone and Rayzor will perform, with Larry Dogg hosting the event. They were chosen to be a part of the series due to their previous appearances at BBC events and on television. 

"We have seen them perform on BET's Comic View and on Comedy Central," said Janette Francois, SPC-BBC president. "Besides, they have performed here at FIU before, just last fall and years prior."

The idea behind Fall Fest is for students to get to know others and to see how they can be involved in University life, said Rafael Zapata, assistant director of the Department of Campus Life, Orientation and Recreation and advisor to the Fall Fest committee.

Ralph Cadet, an international relations major, recommends all students to attend Fall Fest.

 "I have gone to this event in past years, and I have loved it every time," Cadet said. "You can have fun with your friends and with other people, and best of all, it is free. Students should at least take a little time to go and check what this event is all about."

Headline: Model of Health...a wellness column: Low-fiber diets, tobacco abuse among stomach cancer risk factors
Author: Sandra Mateu / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As I was reading the magazine Vida Americana (translated as "American Life"), I stumbled upon a short article titled "Do you suffer from stomach cancer?" The article offered a checklist of stomach cancer symptoms. As I decided to check off every symptom that I suffer normally, I was astonished that I checked 83 percent of the list.  

Alarmed by the results, I decided to find out more on the topic and do some research on stomach cancer.

The checklist included these symptoms: abdominal pain, indigestion, bloating sensation, nausea and heartburn.  

According to the National Cancer Institute, stomach cancer. also known as gastric cancer, is a disease in which malignant (cancerous) cells form in the lining of the stomach. 

An extended list of symptoms given by Baptist Health South Florida Hospital includes discomfort in the abdomen, diarrhea or constipation and vomiting blood or blood in the stool.

I do not suffer from any of the symptoms on the extended list but my concern is that I could start experiencing them if I don't take care of the symptoms I suffer now. 

But first, what is the cause of these symptoms? Currently, there is no certain cause to stomach cancer, but Baptist Health South Florida Hospital suggests these as risk factors: diets high in salted foods and starch and low in fiber as well as tobacco abuse. 

Statistics from The American Cancer Society show that about 21,260 Americans will be diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2007. 

"There will be about 11,210 deaths from this type of cancer in 2007," said its web site.

If you have doubts about your physical state and if you suffer from this disease, the following tests may be used to determine your condition: physical exams blood chemistry studies, complete blood count (CBC) and CT scan (CAT scan)

Treatment will be determined by factors such as your age, overall health and medical history.

Our lifestyle and diet definitely affects us on many ways and if we do not pay attention to it, stomach cancer could be a regrettable consequence. Make sure to watch out what you eat and control your habits to help your body stay healthy.

Headline: Recreation facilities offer various fitness options
Author: Lauren Agosto / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Junior Sebastian Garcia plays basketball at least four times a week at the University Park Recreation Center, a facility he enjoys because it's easily accessible to students.

"This is a great facility. One of the best in Miami," Garcia said.

Besides a gym consisting of 12,500 square-feet of fitness space including free use of weights, resistance machines and cardio equipment, FIU offers a wide variety of recreational facilities for students at UP and the Biscayne Bay Campus such as pools, gyms, tennis and racquetball courts. 

But with a student population of 39,500 registered as of Fall 2006, statistics show that the majority of FIU students are not taking advantage of these facilities.

The number of Recreation Center uses this past fiscal year, based upon ID card reader statistics, was over 310,000 - an average of eight visits per student per year. 

This was up from 260,000 visits last fiscal year, meaning more students are using the University's facilities, but there was also an increase in student population: approximately 2,000 students.  

Tennis court use, racquetball court use and Panther Hall pool usage adds more than 30,000 annual uses - many of which are recurring individuals, however. 

All recreation services are paid for by students through the Activity and Services fee of approximately $11 per credit hour and are then available at no additional charge to all enrolled students. 

With so many facilities students are paying for, one might wonder why more students don't take advantage of them.

Director of Recreational Facilities Robert Frye believes that just like any extracurricular activity, participation is mostly affected by people's schedules and other things going on in their lives - classes, studying and life itself. 

"We can't meet everyone's needs, just as the Graham Center, SPC [the Student Programming Council], Greek Life or Housing can't meet everyone's needs. We can provide the opportunities, the information, the programs and the facilities, but you can't force people to participate," Frye said. 

Junior Christopher Bello cites limited time as a reason that someone may not use the facilities. 

"When I am on campus, I'm either in class or working. Between balancing work and school, I don't have a lot of free time. There just aren't enough hours in the day," Bello said.

But, according to sophomore Mario Semiglia, the reason could be that students don't know about the available facilities.

"I wasn't aware that we had pools on campus," Semiglia said. "I use the gym, but I didn't know we had pools and tennis courts. I will definitely be using them now." 

Despite some lack of awareness and conflicting schedules, Frye encourages students to visit the Recreation Center and is putting forth maximum effort in order to accomplish this. He is doing this by promoting the facilities through freshman orientation and first-year experience classes.

"Everyone is paying for them, might as well use them," Semiglia said.

Headline: EXPRESS YOURSELF: Skin becomes canvas for self-expression
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
It's not often that people are excited about being stabbed by a needle for hours on end. 

But for Jacksin Valiente, it's an opportunity he's been looking forward to his entire teenage life. 

At age 18, he was finally legal to purchase his own tattoo to express himself to the world. 

"I couldn't wait," he said. "My parents were really strict and they didn't want to sign for me. Tattoos are like badges, they're like those pins you wear on your clothes of your favorite band. I can tell a lot about a person by the tattoos they've chosen - a lot of them are really self-explanatory."

After getting his first tattoo - a logo of The Stray Cats, one of his favorite bands at the time - Valiente never looked back. Valiente even had his seven-year old nephew Clyde etch a tattoo on him. 

"[My nephew] drew something up," Valiente said. "I ran him through and told him what to do. He drew a little skull with batwings on my neck." 

Esquire estimated in March 2002 that one in eight Americans have a tattoo. 

In 2000, National Geographic News stated that 15 percent of Americans were tattooed (about 40 million people). 

A Harris poll said that 40 percent of people ages 25-40 have at least one tattoo.

At 31, Valiente is covered with more than 150 tattoos and is etching his own designs at Ocho Placas, a custom tattoo shop located at 2640 S.W. 8th Street. 

While working there, he has seen his share of extreme and outrageous requests in the shop.

"I had a guy who was involved in the Ku Klux Klan. 

He had just moved to Florida and he was turning over a new chapter in life and he wanted to get away from that stuff," he said. "We just started tattooing over it and covering it up all the old tattoos."

With shows like "Miami Ink" growing in popularity, Valiente believes that tattoos are becoming more popular than ever and don't have the same negative stigmas associated with them. 

Junior Rick Marquez is one of the 40 million people who express themselves through body art on each of his shoulders and on his left wrist and forearm. 

He received his first tattoo when he was 18 - his name written in Chinese letters. 

Not long after, his grandmother Magarita passed away, prompting him to get a tattoo of a hand praying with a rosary; the art runs from his upper shoulder down to his elbow.

"Every day I look at my tattoo in the mirror, and it reminds me that she's always going to be there with me," Marquez said.

Besides expressing himself through his body art, Marquez likes to flash people with his custom made diamond cut gold "grillz."  

"I wear my golds about 80 percent of the time," Marquez said. 

Every night before he goes to bed, Marquez makes sure he brushes his 'grillz' with a toothbrush so luster is not lost.

"I got to keep'em looking right. I don't want them to lose their bling effect. Whenever I go out, I want to blind people when I smile."

Some people feel that body art doesn't have to always be symbolic or meaningful. Sometimes, it's only about aesthetics. 

Freshman Victoria Sanchez had a pink and green butterfly tattooed on her back after getting fired from her job as customer support representative at T-Mobile.

"I was riding in the car with [my friend Sergio]," Sanchez said. "We had gone to pick up our last check and we decided to do something to take our minds of off job hunting so we decided to get tattoos. I don't know why I got it but it became a historical moment for us."

Though her butterfly tattoo doesn't necessarily mean anything, she understands why people would be willing to decorate their bodies for life.

"There are different types of artists. The artist who you can see and know [who] are artists because tattoos and the piercings usually don't have much to say because expression is self-explanatory," Sanchez said.

Headline: Professor chooses Harry Potter over conventional textbooks
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Harry Potter is a book series that many students have grown up with, but when used for teaching in a college classroom, it's a bit of a touchy subject. Nevertheless, adjunct English professor Kenneth Claus ignores the touchiness and analyzes the books in his early morning classes. 

Claus uses the books in his ENC 1101 and 1102 courses, but for the Fall semester, he is only teaching the former. 

The ENC 1101 class itself isn't devoted to the analysis of Harry Potter - it's actually a composition class. Like other ENC 1101 courses, students learn how to write the four basic types of essays - autobiographical, visual, narrative and argumentative. 

According to Claus, about half of the students know that he uses the Harry Potter novels while the other half are taken by surprise. Freshman Wendy Perich, who took one of Claus's courses in Summer B, recalled her reaction when learning that she would be reading stories of the young wizard.

"When I walked into Professor Claus' class, I wasn't sure what to expect," said Perich. "I took my seat and waited for class to begin. He stood up, began to tell us about the class and when I heard that we were going to be reading Harry Potter I was almost too excited to start."

Claus said that many ideas for essays arise from reading the Harry Potter books - students will usually read two of the novels; themes range from good versus evil to racial cleansing. 

Despite the potential essay topics stemming from the books, his method of instructing the composition class isn't free from criticism, particularly from his fellow professors. 

"About half of them knock it, but if you're going to knock it step up," Claus said.

He said that many professors look down on the books because they are technically children's books. But according to Claus, they are more of a hybrid book series meant for both children and adults. 

"As a fellow teacher, it is not something I would do," said English Department Chair Carmela McIntire. "He is using [the Harry Potter novels] with great success." 

According to McIntire, in recent years the English department had to enforce stricter curriculum policies because of the varying quality of courses. 

"There was not enough oversight," McIntire said. "It did not serve the students well."

According to Kimberly Harrison, director of composition for the English department, the ENC programs are moving toward more national standards, but as long as Claus accomplishes the set goals and criteria set up by the department, he has leeway in how he chooses to meet them.

Regardless of the minor disagreements in his teaching method with other professors, Claus said he is spoiled with the students he teaches. 

"Attendance remains very high," Claus said. "Usually only one student is missing if any." 

The feeling is mutual for Claus' students as well. 

"He was very involved with all of the students," said freshman Melissa Rodriguez. "He just has a great outlook on life and teaches so that his students can learn and not so that he can get money."

Claus also believes that teachers should treat their students with the same level of respect they expect from the students.

"You don't treat them like middle school students," Claus said. "A good teacher is always a student."

Claus was the first adjunct professor in the English department to win the University Excellence in Teaching Award in 2000, but his path to prominence wasn't always simple: September 25 marks the 19th anniversary of receiving a complete heart transplant. 

In 1988, Claus suffered from a virus that caused severe heart muscle damage and led to the complete transplant. It was a very experimental procedure at the time, according to Claus. The procedure has a high mortality rate because of the body rejecting the new organ or from toxicity from the anti-rejection medications.

"For some reason, none of that happened to me," Claus said. "The mortality rates are such that very, few people live this long and even fewer are healthy enough to work the kind of schedule I do." 

Claus is now relatively healthy only needing to take a few hours every afternoon to relax and continue taking his medications. Even with his medical condition, he pushes forward with his classes. 

"I realize that a lot of what people think is seriously important is not," Claus said. "I tend to go the extra mile in helping people and have become completely intolerant of intolerance."

Headline: Health Services: Fees, services increase
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Having the sniffles could become a little more bearable after FIU finalizes an emerging agreement with Baptist Health Systems Urgent Care Centers, which could go into effect by the end of this Fall semester. 

Starting Fall 2007, students paid $67.20 in health fees - $20.00 more than previous years. Though the fee has been raised, the extra money is not enough to provide students with all the care that University Health Services would like to offer. 

FIU recently tried offering extended hours at the General Medical Clinic at University Park, but had to discontinue the service due to staffing shortages and its corresponding liability concerns. 

"We have to have access - like it's important to have access to higher education - but you need quality, too," said Dr. Robert Dollinger, executive director of UHS. "You get what you pay for and I don't want to sacrifice quality for longer access."

To keep quality high and prices low, FIU is currently negotiating an agreement with Baptist Health Systems. If the agreement goes as planned, FIU students without insurance would be able to attend any one of eight Baptist Urgent Care Clinics and receive services at a 30 percent discount.

"What it is really about is decreasing out-of-pocket costs for students," Dr. Dollinger said.

The agreement with Baptist Health Systems would also provide more hours of access and more locations to receive health care. 

"The health care center felt it was important that the FIU students be able to obtain care after the clinics were closed," said Dr. Saara Schwartz, a physician at UHS in an e-mail.

The nearest Urgent Care Clinic to UP is the Baptist Medical Plaza at Doral, which is located 15 minutes away and is open everyday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., compared to the General Medical Clinic at UP, which is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 

The Baptist Medical Plaza is nearest to Biscayne Bay Campus, located 17 minutes away, and open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. This is compared to the General Medical Clinic at BBC which is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m, and 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays. 

Though the service may be available by Labor Day this year, representatives at the Baptist Health Systems warn that the agreement is far from final. The amount offered in discounts has yet to be confirmed and may not be allowed to be advertised, according to Lilly Macias, director of Manage Care Contracts. 

"We're not anywhere near a concrete agreement," said Amanda Gonzalez, a marketing manager at Baptist Health Systems.

Robin Telles, reportedly in charge of the contract with FIU, did not return a phone call for comment by the time of publication.

It is also unclear as to whether FIU students will be able to attend all Urgent Care Centers, or only the Baptist Medical Plaza at Tamiami Trail, located 24 minutes away from the UP General Medical Clinic and 38 minutes away from the General Medical Clinic at BBC.

Headline: THE RIAA VS. YOU: Note to music execs: sharing is nice
Author: Rick Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Chances are, you are among the millions of people who download and share music on the Internet. For that, you may be a target of the Recording Industry Association of America. 

You or a friend may have received a nasty letter asking to settle with the RIAA for an amount of money based on how much music you have been accused of sharing. 

Typical settlements average above $3,000, and the RIAA has settled some 2,500 such cases. 

Sixteen FIU students received such letters in April. Today, these students are facing expensive lawsuits and risk having criminal charges on their record. 

That's good for the RIAA, you might say. They're getting back the money they've lost from CD sales dropping due to piracy, right? Actually, a study released by researchers at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina in 2004 says that online music sharing has only had a limited effect on the slide of CD sales in the past few years.

Maybe you're an artist. It's only fair for artists to receive compensation for the music stolen from them. So everyone should pay the RIAA so it can compensate the artists, right? Not really. Few artists so far have seen a cent from the RIAA's pre-litigation settlements.

Music sharing, however, has brought artists money. Music sharing lets fans to try out new music without having to risk spending $15 on a new CD they can't return if they don't like it. It increases artist awareness and allows new bands to become popular faster than ever before.  It has allowed musicians of all genres to reach their target audience and has boosted concert attendance.

But that about buying music online? 

Digital Rights Management makes buying tunes online a bad deal. It restricts how many copies of the song users can burn onto a CD or transfer to MP3 players. DRM also forces you to choose one sole provider of music and one compatible MP3 player. For example, if you buy protected music on iTunes, you can only play it on iTunes and your iPod.

Even Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, Inc., opposes DRM. He says they only use it because the labels force them to. 

The RIAA needs to understand that it's by pleasing customers that you make them want to give you their money. The RIAA needs to find a compromise where recording companies and artists are properly compensated and listeners are happy with the cost of buying music. 

For listeners, this should mean that if you buy a song, it's yours - you own it and you can do whatever you want with it. It should also mean compatibility across music vendors and music players. If you want to buy a song on iTunes and put it on your Zune, you should be able to.

But so far, the RIAA has not made a real investment in researching how to get music to customers in a way that pleases everyone. 

Instead, its efforts have made it lose the respect of many of the artists the RIAA is supposed to represent and the confidence of many of its customers.

The RIAA should realize, a little bit of effort and investment could go a long way. It could make their business more profitable and their customers happier than ever.before.

Headline: Editorial: BK should phase out trans fats
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Let's face it: the pickings are slim when it comes to eating healthy on campus. 

Pizza and burgers abound. Sure, Subway and Einstein Bros. offer healthier sandwiches, but they're fast food nonetheless.

But unless they're eating at Burger King, health-conscious students at least have the comfort of knowing that their grub is trans fat-free. 

Aramark, FIU's food service provider, phased out cooking oil containing artery-clogging trans fats last year, said their district manager, Jonathan Garcia.

But though Aramark can replace trans-fatty shortening with healthier Mazola oil in its own kitchens, it has no control over the oils used in the restaurants it runs as franchises, like Pollo Tropical and Burger King.

Of all the franchise restaurants on campus, Burger King is the only one still using trans fats in its kitchen.

According to a May 17 Miami Herald article, Burger King intends to scrap trans fats around late 2008.

Not soon enough. That's at least a year and a half from now.

In fact, Burger King doesn't even have a set date for replacing its cooking oils in Florida. Right now, it's focusing on making its food healthier in Philadelphia and New York, which have banned the use of trans fat in restaurants by 2008. 

That move suggests that, were Florida to pass a similar law, Burger King would make all efforts to phase out trans fats within months. 

So far, Florida lawmakers have neglected to pass such a law. 

But that shouldn't mean  Florida students should wait  more than a year before getting trans fat-free burgers. 

Every other vendor on campus has eliminated trans fats. Many restaurants near campus have already phased them out as well.

If everyone else on and around campus - whether large chain or mom-and-pop joint - has gotten rid of trans fats in their kitchens,  Burger King can do it, too.

Headline: Editorial: Clinic needs longer hours
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Starting Fall 2007, students paid $67.20 in health fees - $20 more than in previous years.

Administrators justified this 30 percent-plus fee increase saying the money would be used to extend operating hours at the General Medical Clinic on FIU's University Park Campus.

In a sudden change in tack, university officials decided that extending the clinic's operating hours is too expensive.

They tried the expanded operating schedule for a few months, but staff shortages and liability issues cut the project short. 

Now, they're figuring out how else to spend that money.

As a result, FIU is currently negotiating an agreement with Baptist Health Systems. 

Under the agreement, students would get a yet-unspecified discount for treatment at Baptist clinics near either FIU campus. 

This agreement is an unacceptable alternative to extending the clinic's hours.

Consider each alternative:

As far as good deals on health care go, a discounted fee at an expensive private clinic does not compare to free service at a University facility. 

Besides, a rebate coupon at the private hospital is just not worth a $20 hike in health fees.

Dr. Robert Dollinger, executive director of FIU's University Health Services, should make good on his original plan: extended hours for the clinic.

Otherwise, he needs to score a heck of a deal with Baptist to make up for this switcharoo.

Headline: Football: More responsibilities for new defense
Author: Jonathan Ramos / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Last year's lone bright spot, the defense, was overshadowed by negativity. But amidst all the negativity the defense still attained some recognition.

The Golden Panthers featured former linebackers Antwan Barnes, James Black, Alex Bostic and Keyonvis Bouie, who combined for 333 tackles en route to being ranked 28th in the nation in total defense.The group featured Barnes, who was the firt player ever selected in the NLF's amateur draft.

Although the core of the defense left, the graduated linebackers bequeathed a message of advice behind to the young players looking to fill the holes they left. 

"I learned a lot from them," sophomore linebacker Scott Bryant said. "They taught me that being humble is a very important thing." 

Fellow sophomore linebacker Michael Dominguez, who is the favorite to start at weakside linebacker, shares this sentiment.

"They taught us to lead by example," he said. "Some people talk, some people just play, but to lead by example is the way." 

Bryant and Dominguez, along with fellow linebackers Tyler Clawson, Matt Garris, Mannie Wllington and Armond Willis are all promising underclassmen who will try to replace the core of last season's defense, which led the nation in tackles for loss. 

Bryant is the centerpiece of the new linebacker core, and has impressed new head coach Mario Cristobal with his efforts in practice. 

"Motor," Cristobal told The Miami Herald. "The first word that comes to mind is he's got a motor, he's a buzz saw." 

Cristobal believes the team is feeding off Bryant's effort and beginning to resemble his style of play as a team. 

"The guy is going to be a Cannibal. That type of play is infectious and spreads fast, its going to help out the team."

Veteran Defensive tackle Ronald Clarke has noticed Bryant's impact already. 

"Scotty Bryant gets to the ball fast," Clarke told The Miami Herald. "When he gets there he has a lot of explosion so you're going to feel it when he gets to you." 

Bryant is aware of how succesful defenses require several key players, not just one. 

 "We got our hats flying everywhere, we're bringing energy. But without Tyler [Clawson], Mike [Dominguez] and the rest of them, I would not be in the position that I am now." 

Bryant, who played linebacker at Lakeland High School, saw extended playing time following the highly publicized brawl with the University of Miami on Oct. 14 of last season that saw many veteran players suspended. 

Bryant picked up 16 of his 21 total tackles during the final three games of the season and has seen his momentum carry into camp. He enters the season as the favorite to step in full time at strong side linebacker. Coaches and players believe Bryant and others can fill in and produce immediately. 

"They have to be the best they can be," said defensive coordinator Phil Galiano on his new linebackers and their task of replacing departed seniors. "We have about six guys we can rely on to play. We have got what we need here." 

"Statistics can be misleading," Cristobal said. We need to make sure everyone picks up their assignments and does the right things." 

The players have received message.

"People come and go," Dominguez said. 

FOOTBALL, page 12



"You have got to be ready to step up."

Dominguez, like Bryant, saw his playing time increase due to the brawl, and ended strong as 18 of his 23 tackles were compiled during the final two games of the season. 

With all the youth at the linebacker position, the front seven still figure to be the strength of the team as they return seven lettermen along the defensive line. 

Clarke and Jonathan Betancourt will anchor the defense from the inside where they combined for 25 tackles last season. 

In addition, Jarvis Penerton will attempt to replace Barnes as the team's main pass rusher. 

Penerton had two sacks last season as a backup to Barnes, who ranked third in the nation in tackles for loss. 

The secondary returns Lionel Singleton, who is arguably the team's top returning player after tying the school record with five interceptions last season. 

He was given honorable mention by sportsillustated.com in the 2006 All-American team. 

Singleton, who has been hurt for much of camp, will be opposite of Robert Mitchell, who recorded two interceptions last season.

With the veteran leadership in place, it is the young linebackers who will likely be the key to the unit's success this season, and the departed linebacker's advice on being humble and keeping a strong work ethic has had an impact already. 

"We are here to play football, not here for girls or any other distractions," Bryant said. 

"Just football."

&nbsp;
FIU 3, NEU 2


FIU (1-0) mustered a 3-2 (21-30, 30-22, 25-30, 30-21, 15-11) comeback victory against the Northeastern University (0-1) at the Cal Molten Classic in Berkeley, Calif. for the first win of the season. 

Outside hitter sophomore Olga Vergun recorded a career-high 28 kills coupled with a team-high .449 percentage.

Vergun's performance was complemented by fellow sophomore outside hitter Yarimar Rosa, who recorded 23 kills, 16 digs and five blocks.

Senior setter Keila Oliveira led the team with 61 assist. She led the team in assists last season as well.

The score was 10-10 in the deciding fifth game, when Vergun and Rosa recorded back-to-back kills to begin the 5-1 run.



FIU 3, IDAHO 1



The Golden Panthers (2-0) won their second consecutive game to begin the season against Idaho 3-1 (30-22, 30-15, 22-30, 30-21) in the second match of the Cal Molten Classic in Berkeley, Calif.

Outside hitter Yarimar Rosa followed her 23 kills from game one with 22 kills and a .357 hitting percentage. She was one dig away from recording her second double-double in a row. Outside hitter Olga Vergun contributed 19 kills herself, and junior Mariana Drumeva led the team with a career-high 18 digs.

Idaho recorded the first point of the game, but that would be their only lead of the first two games, which they lost 22-30 and 15-30 respectively.

Game three was the Golden Panthers worst game as they fell 22-30, but the team bounced back clinching the victory in game four with efficient play. Both sides made only four attacking errors.



FIU 0, CALIFORNIA 3



The only ranked opponent in the Cal Molten Classic gave FIU its biggest challenge as FIU (2-1) lost their first contest of the season against No. 12 California 0-3 (30-23, 30-16, 30-21) in Berkeley, Calif.

FIU's offensive output was reduced by more than half as outside Yarimar Rosa recorded 11 kills versus her 20+ performances in the two previous games. Angie Pressie was named tournament's Most Valuable Player propelled her team to a perfect tournament (3-0).

Cal's net protection led to outblocking FIU 15-7 and holding FIU to a negative hitting percentage for the match (-.018). Ellen Orchard had the biggest defensive impact with her nine blocks.

The team's quick starts in the first two games did not prevent the Golden Panthers to be shutout. Cal jumped to a 5-1 lead in the third and deciding game. The Golden Panthers clawed their way to within 2 points, 16-18. However, Cal responded with seven straight points.

Headline: Students learn from Vick trial
Author: Hank Kurz Jr. / AP Sports Writer
&nbsp;
BLACKSBURG, Va. - The doors that lead to the large auditorium where Virginia Tech's football team meets are kept propped open these days, giving passers-by a clear view to what once appeared to be the Hokies' inner sanctum.

Outside, the words "Michael Vick Hall" on the wide open wooden doors are hardly detectable, and have been for weeks since his legal troubles became increasingly apparent.

While the goal of minimizing Vick's impact at Virginia Tech seems clear, in the offices where coach Frank Beamer and his assistants are preparing for their season opener on Saturday against East Carolina, the support for the Atlanta Falcons quarterback is unwavering.

"I thought Michael Vick took a big step yesterday," Beamer said Tuesday, speaking of Vick's statement of apology and regret that came minutes after he pleaded guilty to a federal dogfighting conspiracy charge in Richmond, possibly ending his career.

"I thought he was extremely sincere. I'm pulling for Michael Vick. I know how I know him, like him, think about him. I'm pulling for Michael Vick."

Beamer, who coached Vick for three seasons and whose team rode his dazzling skills to the Sugar Bowl national championship game in 2000, met with Vick at the NFL Draft in April, around the same time Vick met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank. Vick admittedly lied 

FOOTBALL, page 12

to Goodell and Blank about the case.

"We'll keep the conversation and what was said between us," Beamer said when asked if Vick also had lied to him at their meeting in New York.

Beamer said he hasn't spoken with Vick since, and it's clear Vick's problems is not a favorite topic.

The Hokies already are in the midst of an intense week, preparing for the first game since a gunman killed 32 people and himself on the Virginia Tech campus.

The shootings happened nine days before local officials in Surry County raided a home Vick owned as part of a drug investigation, setting off what evolved into the dogfighting probe that has seen Vick and three associates plead guilty.

Each faces 5 years in jail when sentenced later this year.

The NFL has suspended Vick indefinitely without pay. The Falcons intend to pursue the $22 million in bonus money he already received in a $130 million contract signed in 2004.

Several Hokies players saw the former Virginia Tech star on television Monday, either on his way into the federal courthouse greeted by protesters and supporters, on his way out to the same reception or struggling to express his sorrow on a podium later.

Linebacker Vince Hall said players can learn from it

"You've always got to make the right decisions, and if you do wrong, you're going to pay for it and all you can do is serve your time for it and change," he said.

Vick's somber apology was a good beginning, Hall added.

"For him to come out and talk about it and (say) `Yes, I did it and I'm sorry' and to apologize to the kids, that's the main thing," he said. "It's the kids that look up to him and once you say sorry to them, there's not much you can say after that."

Tailback Branden Ore, who spent a semester working in a warehouse when he was slacking academically and was told by his coaches to go home and evaluate how much football meant to him, has found Vick to be a good guy.

The lesson came through loud and clear

"I think anybody that's in that kind of position knows that just as quick as you get built up, they'll break you down. You've just got to be careful of what you're doing and who you are hanging with," the starting tailback said.

But he added, he agreed Vick already has made a first step toward redemption.

"From the impression that I got, the speech was sincere. He didn't have it written down. That was straight from the heart, so I would say America is a forgiving country once you show people that you are really sincere about the mistakes that you made."

The lesson, wide receiver Justin Harper said, was much like the one the Hokies have been highlighting each day since the April 16 shootings brought tragedy to campus.

"You've got to value each day," he said.

Headline: Men's and women's soccer learning from new coaches
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Men's soccer.

The men's soccer team begins the 2007 without former head coach Karl Kremser since 1979. Alumni Munga Eketebi played four years for the FIU soccer team under Kremser from 1983-1986. He was an assistant coach last season with FIU and was announced the head coach following Kremser's retirement. The team returns to play Aug. 31 against Bowling Green at University Park.

The roster consists of five returning seniors, but without last season's leading scorer, forward David Hope. The returning seniors, especially forward/midfielder Christian Caporaletti, will be expected to fill in Hope's shoes as the leading scorer. Caporaletti was second on the team last season in goals scored with four. Half of the two goals were of the game-winning variety.

Scoring will be take pressure off goalkeeper, Kyle Thomas, who shared playing time with former Golden Panther goalkeeper, Shawn Crowe. Thomas did record the same amount of saves, 42, than Crowe in four games less played.

The Golden Panthers fell short against some of the top ranked teams, but they played competitively for the majority of those games due to their defense. No. 9 USF, No. 11 California, No. 9 South Carolina and No.2 Southern Methodist University did not allow one goal to the Golden Panthers. Only No. 17 Kentucky allowed one goal in a double overtime 1-2 loss.

Eketebi is one of several new head coaches at FIU and will look to improve on last season's 6-10-2 record, which ended with four consecutive losses.

Women's soccer

Thomas Chestnutt enters the 2007 season as the second head coach in FIU women's soccer. Chestnutt was an assistant coach at Fresno State fro 2004-2006. He is credited for his recruiting abilities and helping the Bulldogs' program win their first ever Western Athletic Conference Tournament Championship.

The golden panthers are without their two top scorers from last season, Camilla Durrant and Nana Rasmussen. Durrant scored six goals in eight games last year, and the Golden Panthers will miss her offensive output as they did not win a game last season in which they scored one goal.

Midfielder/forward Michelle Casadevall scored the third most goals on the team, three. Forward Maria Gauldron was the leader in assists despite not scoring last season.

The team will hope that their two senior goalkeepers, Madeline Gannon and Jessica Vaccaro, will use their experience to limit defensive mistakes and make more saves.

The Golden Panthers will open their season against the University of Florida at the Florida Gulf Coast Tournament in Ft. Myers, Fla.

Headline: Football Notebook: First game looks to be a challenge
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Head coach Mario Cristobal and the rest of the Golden Panthers will encounter a brutal splash of reality from the Penn State Nittany Lions, 107,000-seat Beaver Stadium, and legendary coach Joe Paterno Saturday Sept. 1. 

It is going to be loud, it isn't going to be pretty, and more than likely it is going to hurt.

FIU's offense will showcase their new talents and system against a school notorious for producing All-American linebackers and a secondary led by blazing junior Justin King, one of the top corners in the nation. 

Meanwhile, Dan Conner will be replacing two-time Bednarik Award winner Paul Posluszny at middle linebacker, and the comparisons between Conner and the NFL linebacker have been made.

 While the offense will be hard pressed to put up points on the board, the defense provides the best chance to keep this game competitive. While the Lions rushing attack is sufficient, it is the weak spot of their offense and the Panthers will need to shut it down in order to force the ball into quarterback Anthony Morelli's hands, from where the secondary can create the turnovers needed to keep this game close.

The impact of playing this game on the road is paramount. The quarterback position, already one of the most uncertain spots on the team, will face with near certainty a far different atmosphere than any he has ever played in before, and anybody would be a fool to believe that it will not affect them. 

It will be up to the running back tandem of Julius Reams and A'mod Ned to provide consistency if the offense stalls.

While it is obvious that the Golden Panthers are in over their heads in the season opener, do not count out a close game. Last year they faced a team of equal talent in the Miami Hurricanes, and while the scoreboard indicated a blowout, the score was only 13-0 leading up to the infamous brawl. 

The team displayed a strong amount of resolve last year, from the Orange Bowl game to the tough seven overtime loss to Middle Tennessee. Starting from the opening snap, they are going to need to apply their mental toughness on the field.

Turnovers will tell the tale of this game. The offense must not put the ball on the ground or give away passes, and while it seems the most basic of strategies, it can mean the difference between a reasonable game going into the fourth quarter or the third stringers seeing extended playing time. 

One bright note for the Panthers is that this is far and away their toughest game of the season and will be an on-the-job lesson in mental toughness and self-accountability. Above all, success at any level will breed the confidence needed for this young team as they continue their tough streak through Sept.

Headline: NO TRANS FATS: FIU moving toward healthier cooking options
Author: Susana Rodriguez / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Before reaching for that next cookie, chip or even microwaveable popcorn, a glance at the Nutritional Facts labels could stop you in your tracks.

"Trans-fats are as bad as saturated fats," said Dr. Adriana Campa, assistant professor of the Department of Dietetics and Nutrition at the school of Health Sciences, "Our bodies' process them but they increase bad cholesterol and decrease good cholesterol."

According to the American Dietetic Association, bad cholesterol - Low Density Lipoprotein- takes cholesterol from the liver to clog the arteries, leading to heart disease, while good cholesterol -High Density Lipoprotein- carries it from the arteries back to the liver. 

But when on a rush between classes, how to know which foods have them and which foods don't?

Jonathan Garcia, resident District Manager of FIU's food service provider, Aramark, answered the question.

"Aramark has a zero-percent trans-fat policy for their brands like Fresh Food Company, Gracie's Grill and Montague's," he said in a telephone interview. "With anything we run as a franchise, we have to comply to their policy."

All Aramark brands use a zero trans-fat oil provided by Mazola. Avidai Manso, Biscayne Bay Campus chef, said the BBC cafeteria has been using Mazola oil since last year when they switched from Frymax, a shortening loaded with trans and saturated fats. 

According to Garcia, the only company on campus that uses trans-fats is Burger King because of their vegetable oil, although they are moving toward a zero trans-fat policy. A  Miami Herald article written May 17 said that they may be able to stop food production with trans-fat by the end of this year.

"Rolling out trans-fat free oils is the first phase to becoming a completely trans-fats free system," said Keva Silversmith, a spokesperson for Burger King Corporation. "As far as the State of Florida goes, we don't have a set date for rolling out the oils yet. The first priority is to comply with state regulations in New York and Philadelphia. Our second priority is to supply where we can most quickly. By the end of 2008, the whole country will be trans-fat free in restaurant cooking oils." 

Dr. Campa explained why, despite its risks, some restaurants still use the bad fats.

"Manufacturers use trans-fats because it increases the shelf life of their products, but for us it increases the risk of coronary heart disease, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and arteriosclerosis," Dr. Campa said.

New York is phasing out trans-fats between July 2007 and 2008, while Philadelphia is following suit September 2007 through 2008. Once their year deadlines are reached, trans-fats will be banned from use in restaurants in both states. Aramark has self-implemented a nationwide health initiative to screen out foods with trans-fats. The process begins at the corporate level with chefs that screen products for distribution and ends on campus, Garcia said, and added that if the company finds a product has trans-fats, and if it's an Aramark product, it stops using it.

"We try to stay aware of research and development that may impact our business," Garcia said. "When we find out about this, that not only affects the company but the nation, we respond immediately."

Off-campus food options that avoid trans-fats are also available, such as the Latin American Restaurant and Cafeteria on Coral Way and 107 Avenue, which displays signs saying, "Because we care about your health we use 0 trans-fat cooking oil."

According to Carlos Reyes, Latin American's manager, the restaurant decided over a month ago not to use trans-fats. He said customers ask to see the new box of oil to see if they're really not using trans-fats and commend the restaurant for their efforts.

"Even though this oil costs double what the old oil does, we still buy it," Reyes said. "We want to be an example to follow, not only in business but in concern for the health of our customers and the public." 

At the moment, Aramark is working with interns from FIU's Department of Health and Sciences and school chefs to design menus and healthy food choices, Garcia said.

Manso highlighted BBC's Grab & Go menu where "everything is a healthy choice and is made every day."

He also encouraged students to pitch food requests.

"If they want to see something, we can change the menu. I want to see the students happy: if you're not happy, we're not happy," Manso said.

To limit trans-fat intake, Dr. Campa recommends cooking and dressing with olive oil plus limiting fatty meats, whole milk products, and tropical oils. Other sources of trans-fats are deep-fried foods, baked products, crackers, margarine, nondairy creamers, and fast foods. 

"The damage done by food choices today are seen twenty to thirty years down the road and translates into lower life expectancy," Dr. Campa said.

Headline: Engineering Center: Famed solar house gets another chance
Author: Evelyn Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The solar house which won FIU a spot in the National Solar Decathlon and an invitation to the 2008 China Summer Olympics was forgotten after it was destroyed by Hurricane Wilma in 2005. 

Two years later, Emerging Green Builders, a student organization concerned with the fate of the solar house, is working to bring it back to life through a new design. 

The solar-powered house, which took two years to build, was designed for a competition of Energy Balance at the National Solar Decathlon in Washington, D.C. The house not only won the section of the Energy Balance Competition in the Decathlon, but also resulted in FIU being the only US university to be invited to create an energy-efficient house in Beijing, China for the Summer Olympics.

Once the competition was over, the materials were disassembled and sent back from Washington D.C. to the FIU Center for Engineering & Applied Sciences. The day the parts arrived, the University grounds were evacuated due to a hurricane alert. The material was never safely stored. When Hurricane Wilma struck the next day it destroyed almost $200,000 worth of materials. 

"The team was very, very upset. During the competition, everyone had a goal. After the solar house competition, 80 percent of the students were gone, we lost momentum," said Ming Feng, a participant in the Solar Decathlon competition in 2005.

With very little drive to continue the rebuilding of the house, the few materials that were saved before Wilma struck began to wither away.  

Last February, Professor Yong Tao gathered a group of students and formed an organization named the Emerging Green Builders; their first mission was to rebuild the solar-powered house. 

The house is located near the parking lot at FIU CEAS. Built and bolted to the ground, with the windows in play, from a distance the only thing that seems to be missing is a good paint job. However, once one moves in closer, small details, such as flooring, are still needed to complete the project.    

The solar-powered house will be permanently rebuilt on the CEAS. Once it is completed, it will be showcased for educational purposes. 

"We hope to use it as a learning lab for students and their projects," said Clayton Owens, president of the Emerging Green Builders.

For future engineering students, the solar house may provide courses on alternative energy. The courses will revolve around the basics and understanding of how a solar house works; the house will be used as examples for their studies. 

For present students, the house will be used as a study and an example for the future Solar Decathlon competition of 2009, where FIU is planning to compete again. 

The house will also be opened to the public, so that everyone who visits will realize the effectiveness and productivity of a solar-powered house. Stephanie Strange, assistant director of Recruitment and Retention, hopes that the open access to the solar house will encourage others to practice the use alternative energy.

The rebuilding process of the solar house has been delayed due to a lack of resources. According to Owens, mostly everything for the house was damaged in Hurricane Wilma and the price to have the materials replaced has been $50,000. The School of Engineering has given the Emerging Green Builders a grant of that amount. The only missing material is the flooring. Emerging Green Builders is hoping for a donation on any wood, cork or bamboo floors.    

The date of when the project will be finished is unsure. Feng believes it might take two months, if all goes as planned. 

"Right now we have a contractor who is doing the renovation of the major systems, like foundation, flooring and wall sheathing, but once we have it hurricane-resistant and compliant with the Florida building code, we hope to have students help in restoring the houses beauty," Owens said. 

With new challenges ahead, the Emerging Green Builders will continue and finish the solar house. 

"This is a good project and we are trying to do all that is possible to make the material useful and make sure that it does not go to waste," said Emerging Green Builders member Eugenia DeMarco. 

Emerging Green Builders is a group of approximately 40 students and professors. 

Anyone is welcome to attend the group, no matter what one's major might be. 

"Support to our program is very important. Right now we need the support from FIU students desperately," Feng said. For more information on the Emerging Green Builders, visit their Yahoo Group at http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fiugreen/ or visit their Web site at www.fiugreen.org.

Headline: Election 2008: Obama talks politics at Miami nightclub
Author: Jose Maya / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
When one thinks of South Beach nightclubs, they may picture blue Long Island iced teas, dancing crowds and flashy strobe lights. Last Saturday, there was a different view in the mix: political talk. 

Democratic candidate Barack Obama was in town Aug. 25 as he hoped to fundraise for his campaign.

The event was part of the Generation Obama's campaign, launched at the trendy South Beach hotspot Mansion, 1235 Washington St, intended to attract younger voters all across the nation. 

But age didn't matter, as the Illinois senator hoped to gain financial, as well as motivational support, in front of a packed house of donors of all ages.

And no stranger to a lot of money is former Miami Heat star Alonzo Mourning who, along with his wife Tracy, introduced Obama to the crowd.

The floor was well-polished and a large U.S. flag hung in the back of the stage. He wore a blue tie and typical dark suit. After a quick acknowledgement and a chant for the Chicago Bulls, Obama jumped into the issues. Although he spoke very broadly on all, he started with a topic that both he and Miami are familiar with: minorities and diversity.

"Hispanic immigrants are mistreated and that affects all of us," Obama said.  "And two years ago we saw what happened with Katrina."

Obama's criticism of the Bush administration continued when he spoke of foreign policy and the heatly-debated Iraq issue.

"America is ready for change," Obama said, "It is time to bring our troops home."

He also mentioned that there is not reason why a leader should not talk to his enemies. 

His views on this stirred controversy a few weeks ago, when he said that if elected president, he would talk to leaders of countries like Cuba and Iran, two countries labeled as enemies by the Bush administration. 

At the event, he also spoke briefly about the need for better health care, human rights, and the need to stop wire tapping and global warming.

He emphasized America's readiness for a turnaround.

That turn may run into some stoplights depending on what the US top army general in Iraq, David Petraeus, says when he gives his updated report on the situation this September.

The Illinois senator also touched on education. 

"I want to make college affordable for every American." Obama said, "We need more men in college and less in jails." 

But having affordable tuition may be harder with a tuition hike in sight for several universities across Florida.

For the college students who attended the event though, Obama's words rang clear.

"I'm a supporter. I believe in what he says and I like his grassroots involvement," said FIU senior Veronica Majano.

"I think the Generation Obama campaign gives it an aesthetic value," said University of Miami graduate Zachary Lohen.

They both paid $25 for a shot to see Obama. Others weren't so lucky to get the discounted student rate.

"I think he's so well-spoken and great. I don't mind spending the $100 to get in," said UM alumna and employee Rebecca Scully.

For now, the hip-hop music will continue to thump inside Mansion as club goers dance and drink the night away.

For Obama's campaign, this is just another step in the race against Sen. Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.
