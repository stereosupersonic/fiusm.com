Headline: Men's Soccer wins sixth consecutive game, 5-0
Author: Diasy Fernández/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
What began as a tough encounter with the Red Dragons of Oneonta State, ended smoothly and victoriously for FIU. 

FIU 5, Oneonta State 0

The Golden Panthers landed their sixth straight win of the season on Friday night against Oneonta State at University Park. The Red Dragons were stomped with 5 goals made by FIU in the second half.

Neither team scored in the first half.

The second half was completely different. The score was tied until 60 minutes into the game, when forward Matias Asorey scored on assists by John Pulido and Bobby Boswell.  

From this point on, the Golden Panthers unleashed an impressive offense. At the 70 minute marker, a cross from Juan Rivera to Pulido allowed Asorey to score once again.

Forty-four seconds later, Asorey was at it again, making his  second hat trick at FIU and 9th goal of the year. Asorey punished clumsy moves by Red Dragon goalie Jack Potter, by netting his 3rd goal of the game at 70:44.           

A cross kick by Lucas Scudeler and Oscar Gil, allowed Junior midfielder Billy Boswell to score at the 73:45 marker. It was Boswell's first goal of the season.    

On the 81st minute, FIU left its last impression, and its fifth goal, to freshman midfielder Sean Collins. A pass by sophomore forward Paul Kovolos was directed to Collins, who kicked straight into the back of the net. This goal sealed the game for the Golden Panthers, and Collins' status as a promising player. 

Overall, the Golden Panthers overthrew the Red Dragons with 15 shots, 9 on goal. The Dragons tried to move in with their five shots by Ryan Rummery and Antonio DiMuccio, but failed.

Despite FIU's 5 goals, Oneonta State's goalkeeper Jack Potter made 4 saves. Golden Panther keeper Roy Rosenberg made 4 saves as well.  

"I'm very happy with the game. It is our ticket to the playoffs," said Asorey.

"Our best quality is that we play well together. This team is not about just one individual. If it were, that individual could be blocked, and the team would die.  I think the fact that everyone gives their all is why we win. And this is what we've lacking in other years," Asorey added.

Even with this first conference win, Asorey feels "a little worried about future games. We didn't play as well as we should have tonight. A couple of goals helped win the game, but we need to pick it up as a team."

Florida International has risen to 6-4-0, 1-0-0 in the ASC. Oneonta State falls to 4-6-1, 1-1-0 in the ASC.

FIU 2, Barry 0

The men's soccer team added the game against Barry University to their list of victories. The Buccaneers, ranked No. 4 in NCAA Division II, were taken down by the Golden Panthers, who won 2-0 on the night of Oct. 6 at FIU. 

A cross by Oscar Gil enabled Matias Asorey to make the first goal, 13 seconds before the first half was over. 

Gil made another contribution to the game. 

At minute 85, he sent the Buccaneers home by scooting past the Barry defense and fighting with keeper Ron Goguen before scoring for FIU. 

FIU keeper Roy Rosenberg had one shot on goal compared to Barry's Goguen having to defend 11.

This was Barry University's first loss this season, dropping their record to 8-1-1.

Sophomore Oscar Gil was awarded Player of the Week by the Atlantic Soccer Conference on Oct. 7. Gil, a transfer from Lynn University in Boca Raton, was a key player in the winning contest against Barry. His 3 goals and 2 assists (as of Oct. 7) have taken him to No. 5 in the ASC.

&nbsp;
Despite battling to a first half draw against nationally ranked Villanova, the Florida International Women's Soccer team could not close the deal in the second half, and lost 0-2 before a crowd of 140 fans at University Park Friday afternoon.

For the first time all season, the Golden Panthers were able to win more corner kick opportunities than their opponent, and for just the third time this season, they equaled their opponent's shot attempts.  But it all went for naught, as the Wildcats (9-1-3) capitalized on their chances in the second half. Senior Midfielder Kristin Dunst scored a quick goal in minute 47 and sophomore Forward Regina Villari added another in minute 80 to ice the match. Both goals were assisted by Senior Midfielder Julie Battista.

Seton Hall 2, FIU 1

The team fell in overtime Sunday afternoon to Seton Hall at University Park, 2-1.  

The Golden Panthers  gave up the winning goal in overtime in the ninety-third minute.   

Sophomore Midfielder Janessa Taddei scored the lone goal. Freshman Forward Elizabeth Durozel assisted on the play.  

FIU drops to 1-11-1.

Headline: Volleyball drops to 5-14, Kos maybe out entire season
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
FIU's volleyball team lost two conference matches this week, dropping the team's record to 5-14 overall and forcing it to focus on making the Sun Belt Tournament.

The defending Sun Belt champion Golden Panthers host the tournament Nov. 21-23.

The losses to Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee leave FIU with a 1-4 record inside the Sun Belt. 

Currently, FIU is tied with Denver, Lousiana-Lafayette and New Orleans for seventh with one conference win.

"The pressure is on [the players]," head coach Cookie Stevens said. "If nothing else motivates you, then the thought of selling tickets (rather than playing in the tournament) should."

Nonetheless, Stevens expects her team to bounce back.

"They always come through in the end," she said. "I'm confident that it's going to happen."

"Jenny [Owens] and Charlie [Ball-Llovera] are mainstays for us. We need to be able to go into the bench," she explained.

In Saturday's rematch of last year's conference championship match, the Hilltoppers (19-4 overall, 5-0 Sun Belt) defeated FIU 30-24, 19-30, 30-23 and 31-29.

"We stepped it up, but our team needs to have everyone going at the same time," Stevens said of her team's effort. "Tonight was the strongest performance we have put together."

Western Kentucky used a 12-3 game-ending run to take a 1-0 lead after the Golden Panthers hit .022 in the game.

FIU opened up an 11-5 lead in game 2, before an Owens kill clinched the game.

Owens led FIU with 16 kills. She combined with Ball-Llovera and Debra Amundson to lead all players with 5 blocks each.

Freshman Oksana Zabluev was inserted into the starting line-up and provided the Golden Panthers with a spark, compiling 12 kills, 4 aces and 4 blocks.

"I was very pleased with Oksana," Stevens said. "Offensively, she gave us an edge we haven't had in a while."

After falling behind 2-1, the Golden Panthers fought back from an early deficit in the fourth game and held a 29-26 lead.

The Hilltoppers fought off three match points before taking the game.

Setters Elizabeth Baldwin and Betsy Moreland combined for 42 assists.

FIU fell to 1-4 in five-game matches as Middle Tennessee defeated the Golden Panthers 29-31, 30-26, 25-30, 33-31, 15-9 on Friday.

In the deciding fifth game, the Lady Raiders captured eight of the final 11 points.

Ball-Llovera recorded 17 kills and 6 blocks to pace FIU.

Owens, Fundora and Doan also reached double-digits in kills.

Kos expected to miss rest of season

Nirvana Kos will likely miss the remainder of her senior season due to a herniated disk, according to FIU volleyball head coach Cookie Stevens.

Prior to this weekend, FIU has taken Kos' availability on a week-by-week basis. 

The opposite hitter has played in 38 of the team's 62 games this season and is currently third on the Golden Panthers in kills, behind Adriana Fundora and Jennifer Owens.

During last season's Sun Belt Conference championship run, Kos led the team with 622 kills and 86 aces on her way to a first-team Sun Belt selection. Her 1,283 kills rank first in the program's history. Stevens stressed that her team needs to move forward without Kos.

"We are not waiting for her to come back. We've moved on," Stevens said. 

"There is no guarantee that, if she was back, we'd be playing differently," Stevens added regarding FIU's 5-14 record.

In Saturday's loss to Western Kentucky, the Golden Panthers' starting line-up included Elizabeth Baldwin, Julie Doan, Adriana Fundora, Vanessa Gonzalez-Vinas, Jennifer Owens and Oksana Zablueva.

The Golden Panthers have a busy week lying ahead. On Wednesday, the team hosts the University of Miami before traveling to North Texas and Louisiana-Lafayette on Friday and Sunday.

Headline: Hilltoppers roll over FIU, 56-7
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It didn't take very long for Western Kentucky to establish themselves on offense. The team scored 21 points in the first quarter alone and equaled that amount in the second quarter to head into halftime with a 42-0 lead.

"We knew we were a little overmatched coming into this. We've got a long way to go," FIU coach Don Strock said. "This is our sixth game. It's not like we've been here 60 years."

The Hilltoppers (4-3), who are receiving votes but not ranked in the top 25 in Division I-AA, rushed for 400 yards behind a powerful offensive line further magnifying the troubles the Golden Panthers have had against teams with strong rushing attacks. 

FIU (3-3) has given up a combined 1,068 yards rushing, for an average of 356 yards in each of their three defeats.

"We knew they'd be able to run the ball because they've run on everybody else," said Strock. "We're not there yet. We're not strong enough, not physical enough. We've got to get bigger, tougher."

Offensively, the Golden Panthers struggled all night long. Quarterback Jamie Burke was 5-of-14 for 75 yards and was sacked 7 times. He also fumbled once and threw four interceptions.

Rashod Smith and Jerrid Lundstedt each had 21 yards rushing to lead FIU's ground attack.

Burke's first completion of the contest did not come until 5:32 was left in the first half. The completion was good for 19 yards to Cory McKinney.

The Golden Panthers had 5 turnovers while recording just 7 first downs.

Western Kentucky quarterback Jason Michael was a threat when throwing and running the ball. Through the air, Michael completed 6-of-10 passes for 97 yards while rushing for 3 touchdowns and 45 yards on 6 carries.   

Jon Frazier was the leading rusher for the Hilltoppers gaining 126 yards on 15 carries.

FIU's lone score came with 10:54 remaining in the final quarter on a pass from backup quarterback David Tabor to McKinney.

The Golden Panthers had 72 total yards of offense. 

"It's just another learning experience," Burke said after the games conclusion. "They were moving around a lot, blitzing a lot. They were dancing around, shifting."

Western Kentucky head coach Jack Harbaugh, father to former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Jim, spoke highly of FIU. "I really think they're ahead of the South Florida team [FAU] we played in their inaugural year."

"I think they've done a tremondous job. We were just able to score, score, score, and once it got out of hand, it was a different ballgame."

FIU next faces off against the University of Maine. The BlackBears (6-1, 4-1 Atlantic 10) won their first six games of the season before falling to UMass this weekend. Their strong start placed them in the fourth spot in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches poll two weeks ago. 

Tough road ahead

The second half of FIU's inaugural season will be filled with more competitive matchups. 

Of the five remaining games slated for the Golden Panthers, two opponents, Maine and Gardner-Webb, have either received votes or been ranked in the Division I-AA polls at some point in this season. 

The Golden Panthers will be facing  Gardner-Webb on the 26th for the school's first homecoming football game. The Running' Bulldogs are receiving votes in the Division I-AA polls.

FIU then faces the Dolphins of Jacksonville University. The team's 6-5 record in 2001 included a 35-12 loss to Florida Atlantic, FIU's final opponent of the season.

Albany will come to town on Nov. 9. The Great Danes concluded the 2001 season with a 7-3 record which also included a loss to the Owls of FAU. 

Each team with the exception of FAU is primarily a run-oriented offense. 

The matchup with Florida Atlantic is slated to be an annual showdown. This season's game will be at Pro Player Stadium, the home-field for the Owls. 

FAU dropped their first five games this season. They finished the 2001 season with a 4-6 record. The team is coached by former University of Miami head coach Howard Schellenberger.

Headline: La justicia versus Lori Berenson
Subheadline: Mariana Márquez
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Ni sus estudios de antropología en el Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts  (MIT) en Cambridge, ni la vida de neoyorquina fueron suficiente para lo que le esperaba a Lori Berenson como activista de izquierda en Latinoamérica.

A sus 20 años Lori pensó que las clases de economía agraria centroamericana y la influencia del profesor Martin Diskin serían suficientes para entender y resolver el problema de pobreza y hambre en Latinoamérica.

Lori llegó a El Salvador a finales de la década del 80 y rápidamente comenzó a colaborar como activista de los derechos humanos en distintas organizaciones y comités.  &#8220;Las injusticias en la repartición del dinero y los horrores de la guerra motivaron a Lori a quedarse con el profesor Diskin trabajando en una proyecto de distribución y administración de tierras en El Salvador&#8221;, señaló un vocero de la organización &#8220;Free Lori&#8221;.

En 1989, Lori participó activamente en el &#8220;Comité Solidaridad con el Pueblo de El Salvador&#8221; (CISPES) y a principio de la década del noventa trabajó con el movimiento revolucionario &#8220;Farabundo Martí para la liberación Nacional&#8221; (FMLN), allí continuó hasta Noviembre de 1994, cuando partió hacia Perú.

El arresto y la cárcel

Lori llegó a Perú en la segunda quincena de noviembre de 1994 como 
turista, pero parecía haber tenido otro propósito: servir como eje principal para que el Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Amarú (MRTA) asaltara el Congreso de la República, una acción armada que pudo haber dejado varias víctimas.

Para su familia y amistades, aún no es posible creer que esta joven, que en 1987 se graduó en la Preparatoria La Guardia de Música y Arte, haya tenido que ver con esta organización terrorista.  

&#8220;Lori es acusada de terrorista,  pero ella no lo es. Yo sé que ella es inocente.  Dios sabe que ella es inocente&#8221;,  señaló Mark Berenson, en una entrevista realizada en Marzo de 2001  por un noticiario peruano.  

Para otros,  Lori es tan culpable como culpable cualquiera de los emerretistas que prepararon la toma del Congreso.

Junto con un panameño llamado Pacífico Castrellón, la norteamericana alquiló una amplia vivienda en un conocido barrio residencial.  Allí alojó a un grupo del MRTA que preparaba el ataque. Según la acusación, Lori se hizo pasar como periodista y realizó visitas a la sede parlamentaria y recopiló datos para llevar a cabo el asalto.  

El 30 de noviembre de 1995 fue detenida cuando salía del Congreso.  Estuvo en poder de la policía durante 35 días. En enero de 1996 fue presentada ante la prensa y cuatro días después un tribunal militar dictó la sentencia: cadena perpetua. 

Entre las pruebas en su contra estaban los peritajes, que decían que en los planos manejados por los terroristas para la toma del Congreso había trazos de su mano. Incluso la policía indicó que ella misma preparaba tres veces por semana los alimentos que ingería el comando emerretista.

Después de cinco años de cárcel, el gobierno de Perú reconoció que el juicio militar al que se le sometió fue injusto.  La sentencia de cadena perpetua fue revocada y el caso fue llevado a una corte civil bajo los cargos de colaboración con el terrorismo y asociación ilícita.  En este segundo juicio Lori fue sentenciada a veinte años de prisión.  

Las consecuencias internacionales
	
A partir del arresto de Lori, sus padres, en colaboración con algunos profesores de Nueva York, iniciaron una campaña internacional para su liberación.  En su defensa se alega que Lori fue muy inocente y que esa misma ingenuidad fue utilizada en su contra por el MRTA.
  
Pero hay quienes piensan que eso no fue así  &#8220;Ella (Lori) era mucho más que una periodista o activista de derechos humanos.  Si vemos los hechos, ella sí fue culpable y participó en grupos como el  FMLN  y MRTA&#8221;,  afirmó el Profesor Eduardo Gamarra, Director del Centro Latinoamericano y del Caribe de la Universidad Internacional de Florida.  

El caso Berenson atrajo el interés de organizaciones de derechos humanos y de  figuras como el Reverendo Jesse Jackson,  el ex abogado general de los Estados Unidos  Ramsey Clark y el ex presidente Bill Clinton.  Sin embargo, los Estados Unidos se ha manternido al margen de los esfuerzos por la liberación de la norteamericana.  

&#8220;En ese momento, Estados Unidos estaba ante un dilema porque por una parte le daba todo su aval a Fujimori en la lucha contra el narcotráfico y por otra criticaba a Perú por la violación de los derechos humanos&#8221;, señaló Gamarra.

Con el cambio de gobierno en ambos países la suerte de Lori no va a ser diferente. En Estados Unidos, Clinton aceptó la sentencia del juicio militar y el actual Presidente George W. Bush aceptó la ratificación de la sentencia del juicio civil.  En cuanto a Perú, el ex presidente Fujimori y ahora presidente Alejandro Toledo coincidieron en no intervenir en el caso de la norteamericana.  Especialmente en un momento en el que los intereses de los Estados Unidos son globales y están vinculados a los problemas de otros países.  

Mientras tanto los padres de Lori continúan luchando por su liberación. &#8220;Es increíble  pensar que  Lori ha pasado seis años en la cárcel. Eso es 2,193 días con las  condiciones más horribles.  Nosotros sabemos que ella es inocente y continuaremos luchando para traerla a casa y para que este sea el último 30 de noviembre que ella pase encarcelada&#8221; declaró Rhonda Berenson en el 6to. aniversario del encarcelamiento de Lori.

Headline: Code-switching, spanglish y bilingüismo, ¡Que viva la hispanidad!
Subheadline: Claudia Patricia Davis
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Celebramos con mucho orgullo el mes de la hispanidad en octubre entre los hot dogs y los pastelitos, entre la Coca-Cola y la Materva y en medio de una batalla entre el español y el inglés que pone de manifiesto la teoría darwiniana donde la fuerza se impone ante lo frágil.  No queriendo decir con esto que somos un grupo étnico de naturaleza abúlica, sino más bien que nuestro idioma sufre los cambios que conlleva vivir bajo el dominio de una lengua ajena a la que hemos heredado de la Madre Patria.

¿Cuántas veces no has comenzado una frase en inglés para, sin darte cuenta, terminarla en español? O, ¿cuántas veces no has incluido una que otra palabra en inglés dentro de una conversación con tus amigos bilingües? Al parecer, esta es la regla de comunicación en Miami, Chicago, Nueva York, Los Angeles y otras ciudades norteamericanas donde la densidad de la población hispana es difícil de ignorar.  

Para algunos anglosajones, al igual que otros de habla hispana, el hábito resulta un tanto desesperante. Sin embargo, el fenómeno de code-switching, como se le conoce dentro del campo lingüístico, es común y frecuente. Una de las razones por la cual esto sucede es la imposibilidad de encontrar la palabra o frase apropiada que traduzca lo que queremos decir en un idioma. Como consecuencia, extraemos un término de una lengua para insertarlo en otra. De manera similar, forzamos las palabras en castellano a que se conviertan al inglés. A esto le llaman spanglish.

Algunos sostienen que el spanglish es el idioma de la subcultura hispana en América.  Otros, lo califican de terrorista lingüístico; una especie de Al Qaeda cultural.  En la Página del Idioma Español, el profesor Roberto González-Echevarría de la Universidad de Yale se refiere al spanglish como &#8220;una invasión del español por el inglés&#8221;.  Por su parte el catedrático mexicano y defensor del spanglish, Ilàn Stavans del Armherst College en Nueva York, lanza un ataque verbal contra la Real Academia Española, acusándola de querer imponer el español &#8220;con la cruz y la espada&#8221; en lugar de admitir que la unión de los dos idiomas no es más que una realidad social que demuestra la latinización total en este país.  El hecho es que, sin importar a cuál de las dos ideologías apoyamos, el spanglish siempre será un tema divisivo.  

Todo esto es parte de lo que somos, es parte de ser hispanos. El ser bilingüe nos identifica como hispanos adoptados. Si, adoptados por un país que nos abre sus brazos y nos ofrece un sin fin de oportunidades pero que a su vez, nos convence sutilmente de asimilar sus costumbres, su lengua, su mareante ritmo de vida. La hispanidad no se celebra en octubre; se celebra en los cumpleaños con la piñata, en la Navidad con el lechón asado, en la sonrisa de la abuela cuando le pides la bendición.  La hispanidad la llevas dentro, corriéndote por las venas cada día del año. Habla como quieras and just be yourself, but above all no te olvides de ser hispano.

Después de casi dos años de que su autor pusiera el punto final, las memorias de Gabriel García Márquez estarán disponibles a partir del 10 de octubre en el mundo hispano parlante. Este primer tomo constará de más de 600 páginas, y narrará desde el noviazgo de sus padres hasta la publicación de su primera novela: La hojarasca.

García Márquez ha puesto el mismo perfeccionismo y rigor de hierro que ha caracterizado a todos sus escritos: «Reduje al mínimo las relaciones con mis amigos, desconecté el teléfono, cancelé los viajes y toda clase de compromisos pendientes y futuros, y me encerré a escribir todos los días sin interrupción, desde las ocho de la mañana hasta las dos de la tarde», confiesa el escritor. Y es ese perfeccionismo lo que le hizo cambiar el título de Vivir para contarlo a Vivir para contarla.

Unas de las más grandes preocupaciones de la agencia Balcells, la cual se encarga de los derechos de autor del Nobel colombiano, es la posible incursión en el mercado de una edición pirata. Es por eso que se ha restringido al máximo el número de personas que han podido leer el texto. Sin contar cualquier edición pirata, se habla de casi 500 mil ejemplares que estarían a cargo de cuatro casas editoriales diferentes: Mondadori en España, Diana en México, Norma en la región andina y Sudamericana en el cono sur.

Sobre la narración misma, se habla de una narrativa lineal y cronológica, y no la secuencia cíclica a la que nos tiene acostumbrados. Sin embargo, los lectores del popular Gabo encontrarán ecos de personajes y situaciones que han poblado sus novelas. La descripción física de Aracataca &#8212;pueblo donde nació García Márquez&#8212; es muy parecida a la de Macondo &#8212;pueblo mítico de Cien años de soledad&#8212;: «un lugar bueno para vivir, donde se conocía todo el mundo, a la orilla de un río de aguas diáfanas que se precipitaban por un lecho de piedras pulidas, blancas y enormes como huevos prehistóricos».

El llamado "realismo mágico" que tanto ha caracterizado a la obra del novelista colombiano también se encuentra presente en sus memorias. Es una mezcla de biografía y de episodios novelescos y fantasiosos. «La vida de uno no es lo que sucedió», dice García Márquez, «sino lo que uno recuerda y como lo recuerda». En esencia ésta es una novela macondina que se añade a la obra épica de Macondo. Y como dice la crítica Olga Carreras González en uno de sus libros: «Macondo es el mundo, y los macondinos representan a la humanidad misma, en su inútil lucha contra el dolor, la injusticia, la soledad y la muerte».

El viaje en tren de Munich a Dachau es de aproximadamente 40 minutos. A través de la ventana el verde paisaje se mueve rápidamente, se va dejando atrás un típico pueblito alemán hasta que aparece otro nuevo y así sucesivamente. 

No han pasado ni 10 minutos y ya estoy aburrida. Aprovecho para hojear el libro que compré sobre la ciudad y la guía turística con la que espero no perderme.

"En Dachau fue erigido por orden de Hitler, en el año 1933, el primer Campo de Concentración, el cual serviría de modelo a las demás construcciones levantadas con el mismo propósito...&#8221;

Esa es la razón por la que voy en este tren, muy a pesar de los esfuerzos de esa comunidad por dirigir la atención de turistas y curiosos hacia otras atracciones. El destino de la peregrinación parece ser siempre el mismo.  

A llegar me llama la atención que los letreros son muy pequeños y discretamente señalan la dirección, casi como si fuera un secreto. Sólo cuando se está cerca se puede ver la garita desde donde se vigilaba el acceso. Una cerca de alambre de púas y una fosa para separar el exterior del interior dan la bienvenida.

Es septiembre y la temperatura comienza a bajar, algo redundante, dada la frialdad del lugar. Quedan pocas estructuras en pie, han reconstruido sólo unas cuantas para dar una idea de lo que allí había. De todas formas el vacío también es elocuente. 

A un lado está el museo pero prefiero dejarlo de último, llevo conmigo mis libros y prefiero hacer el recorrido por mi misma y a mi tiempo, sin que me estén empujando o arreando para que vaya más rápido.

Lo primero que llama mi atención es una especie de escultura que asemeja una enredadera de púas pero hecha con figuras estilizadas de esqueletos y que aunque no tienen cara parecen gritar de terror.
El libro dice que se trata de "El Monumento Internacional" y que fue diseñado por el escultor yugoslavo Glid Nandor. Hoy ocupa el espacio de la &#8220;plaza de la llamada&#8221; , donde se tenían que presentar los detenidos dos veces al día para ser contados. A un lado está escrito en varios idiomas una frase: &#8220;Nunca más&#8221;.

Camino lentamente siguiendo las instrucciones de la guía paso por la casa de la guardia, el bunker, un arrollo y llego hasta la llamada barraca X, nombre que se le daba al crematorio. Hay dos hornos, uno parece independiente, el otro es el final de un proceso que se inicia con las duchas y que luego pasa por una disimulada cámara de gas.
   
No puedo quitar la vista de las camillas con las que se introducían a los muertos y a los no tanto en los hornos. Muchas preguntas se vienen a mi cabeza y una extraña mezcla de sentimientos, me da tristeza, dolor, rabia y hasta vergüenza.

Mi mamá me pregunta el por qué de esos dos hornos, yo no le digo nada, pero una voz masculina y en español le responde:
"Porque este ya no se daba abasto y además comenzó a oler muy mal".
Me voltee para ver un hombre mayor que sentado en un banco comía papas fritas y nos miraba. Le di las gracias por el dato y no le hice mayor caso hasta que volvió a hablar.
- ¿De dónde son?
De Venezuela respondimos.
- Ahh de Venezuela -dijo. Yo viví en Argentina luego de que los americanos nos liberaron el 29 de abril de 1945. 

Era así como tenía frente a mi a un sobreviviente del holocausto y de ese campo. Un hombre de contextura fuerte, canoso y que comía papitas fritas. Uno de los pocos que habían vuelto del horror y que aún podía relatarlo. 

Josef nos contó en detalle el año, los meses y los días que permaneció aquí. Recorrimos con él cada uno de los lugares y anduvimos sobre sus pasos, donde durmió, donde comió, donde vio morir a su familia y a sus amigos. Trabajaba en el campo, llevando y trayendo piedras pesadas sin abrigo en invierno y descalzo en verano.

El no supo cómo sobrevivió. Tal vez porque era muy joven y muy fuerte, tal vez porque fue poco tiempo, tal vez tenía que vivir. 
Tal vez era un misterio, así como el número de muertos del campo que van desde 20 mil, según cifras oficiales, a 300 mil, según las no oficiales, o como la cámara de gas que nunca se utilizó.

"Es inexplicable -dijo-, aunque no hacía falta. La mayoría moría debilitada, enferma, por fusilamientos masivos o por experimentos médicos. Dachau fue solo el comienzo".

Me sorprendía la manera en que contaba su historia, a veces como si no le hubiera pasado a él, otras con mucho sentimiento, pero manteniendo siempre la misma expresión, algo parecido a la fortaleza y a la resignación. 

Fuimos juntos al museo y con sumo detalle nos explicó cada cosa, las insignias que llevaban los detenidos, si eran gitanos, si eran judíos, si eran homosexuales, si eran sacerdotes. Todos eran delincuentes pero sin delitos.

"Eran crueles, no parecían seres humanos. Bueno nosotros tampoco, para ellos no éramos nada y así nos sentíamos".
 
Había fotos, testimonios en blanco y negro de esos años. A pesar de que los verdugos habían destruido las pruebas: víctimas y documentos. Quedaban esas fotos y los recuerdos, esos que Josef había dado como testimonio para la película La lista de Schindler y que ofrecía a quien quisiera oirlo.

"A veces me piden ir a los colegios pero a la mayoría de los chicos no les importa lo que pasó". Le entristecía la indiferencia de una generación que no quería recordar, como si hubiese una conspiración para el olvido, algo que él no se podía permitir.

"Desde que regresé no pasa un día sin que yo venga para acá, aunque sea por un rato". Y es que lo que no pudieron hacer los americanos en el 45 fue liberar su memoria ¿Acaso era posible? Y si existía esa remota posibilidad Josef había encontrado la manera de tener a raya el olvido: contar su historia todos los días.

Primo Levi, escritor y sobreviviente del holocausto, quien asumió esa tarea de relatar el horror de esos años, una tarea tan agotadora que terminó por lanzarlo al vacío escribió:     

"Los que sobrevivimos a los campos de concentración no somos verdaderos testigos. Esta es una idea incómoda que gradualmente me he visto obligado a aceptar al leer lo que han escrito otros sobrevivientes, incluido yo mismo, cuando releo mis escritos al cabo de algunos años. Nosotros, los sobrevivientes, no somos sólo una minoría pequeña sino también anómala. Formamos parte de aquellos que, gracias a la habilidad o la suerte, no llegamos a tocar fondo. Quienes lo hicieron y vieron el rostro de la Gorgona, no regresaron, o regresaron sin palabras".

Headline: Current FIU network  problems
Subheadline:  
Author: chewgumma@hotmail.com
&nbsp;
To the Editor,
I'm not sure if you've noticed but since the beginning of the fall semester the FIU network has been extremely slow. A friend of mine managed to contact the UTS support center(I was not so lucky) and was told that the new Everglades dorm was putting more of a strain on the network than expected...duh.  What bothers me is that nothing has even been mentioned (at least not anything that I could find) mentioning what, if anything was being done to fix this problem.
To put things in perspective, at peak usage times which vary daily, but usually last up to 6 hours (and there're usually 2 peaks during the day) i've seen speeds as low as 4Kbps usually it's at a fairly steady but still very slow 8Kbps. 
In comparison, the usual speeds that I've noticed before this fall (since spring 2001)rarely went below 100Kbps. What does this mean? It means much slower web page downloads, as if web research wasn't tedious enough. 
I'd like to know if the Beacon could look into this situation or let me know if there was an announcement about this problem that I somehow missed.

Sincerely,

Author: DrLaz770@aol.com
&nbsp;
Dear Editors,

I was recently on the FIU campus, having just been hired to teach in the education department, and was quite surprised to read Andy Diaz's article in the Beacon, "Israeli claim to land unfounded."

To base his entire point on the basis of one individual is irresponsible and weak journalism.  For there are, in fact, over 200 major Christian organizations in the US alone, that do support the Jew's biblical claim to this small piece of real estate known as Israel.

Whether one believes the Bible or not, most historians do acknowledge that there has been a Jewish presence in that area since the times of Abraham.  This has been documented in a variety of hitorical findings and archeological evidence.  Thus, the Jews have made it their home nearly 2,000 years before Islam even appeared on the scene!

I too share Mr. Diaz's point of view that Jews and Arabs can live together in peace.  But unfortunately for now, the current PA leadership had shown its true colors time and time again.  They have squandered millions in outside support funds (including lots from Israel), not for domestic development but for sponsoring terrorism and violence.  While the Israeli government has outlawed anything Anti-Arab, from political parties (such as Kach) and bumper stickers, the PA side continues to preach hatred & racism.  Israel is not even on the maps in the Palestinian controlled school text books.

Last December I visited Israel for about two weeks.  It was my first time there in 30 long years and I went with an open mind.  I visited some Arab cafes and was very upset to see pictures on the wall of some suicide bombers.  Imagine how us Americans would feel walking into businesses where they glorify the image of Bin-Laden.

Israel has offered its hand in peace.  In spite of the fact that the Israelis have won four major wars of self-defense since 1948, they've still given land, cities, money and even weapons to the Palestinians in the hope for peace.  Remember, soon after the Oslo signing, Arafat rejected Israel's offer of 95% of the land the PA wanted for statehood.  

The peace process takes two to tango.  So far, I just don't see the Arabs too willing to dance to the same music.

Sincerely,

Headline: Morals give life meaning
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
Oscar Wilde, who was once the very embodiment of the word "scandal", would often say that there aren't such things as moral or immoral stories, only good ones and bad ones. One can excuse him for being a bit defensive, but I think he's only partially right. Morals concern our definitions of good and evil, the laws that shape our ethical understanding of the world. A story without a moral, is, practically by definition, meaningless, pointless, useless and, therefore, bad.

I've just seen a movie called "The Rules of Attraction," starring James Van der Beek, which I found, much to my own surprise,  immoral. It's a pretty mediocre flick, and I realize I'm dignifying it way beyond measure by allowing it to stir me into a column. It's just that I found no morals in this story, no right, no wrong, no design, no meaning, no plot, no point. There was no recognizable humanity in it: It was as though the movie had been filmed by aliens. Particularly mean ones. And I hated it. It made me want to go and watch something more wholesome, like midget porn.

Why am I ranting about morals in a college newspaper? Aren't we all for anarchy? Have I suddenly grown an unsightly angel on my right shoulder? 

Am I going to scold you for your life of sin or try to subscribe you to "The Watchtower?"

 Nah.

 But I'm going to ask you to do one thing:

Beware of immoral stories. Not because they might corrupt you, spoil you, destroy you, but because they will waste your time.

Mark Twain suggested that anyone who attempted to find a moral in "Huckleberry Finn" should be shot on the spot, so at the risk of my life I'll say that a) Huck Finn may be one of the most moral characters in literature and that b) I'm not talking about facile, simplistic morals about how it's cool to follow the rules or anything of the sort. 

I'm also not talking about mores, which are basically collective morals, the rules by which a group lives. Those are always there in case you run out of toilet paper, and I hope you know what to do with them.

I'm talking about YOUR morals, and MY morals; about those guidelines that shape our everyday actions. Have you thought about them recently? Or does the very idea of thinking about them smack of lameness? It shouldn't. Your life depends on them, or at the very least your enjoyment of life, because they will give it shape and meaning. Perhaps it might be presumptuous to think that the meaning of life is for each and every one of us to attribute, but, then again, why not? Who else are you going to get answers from? God? The dude is notoriously quiet, hasn't said much in, like, 2,000 years.

 It's perhaps one of life's sneakier tricks that a mostly worthless movie can push someone to analyze his or her ideas. You know what I found immoral about "The Rules of Attraction"? It wasn't the drugs, it wasn't the sex, it wasn't the rock and roll, (although, come on, The Cure? What is this, 1987?) . It was the discarding of humanity: that which is priceless, indefinable, and yet instantly identifiable. I hated it because it was about as human as a can of tuna, only less interesting. 

Revise your morals, define them, refine them. Or do you really want your life to feel like a bad James Van Der Beek flick?

Headline: Internet cheapens romance, friendship
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
JMontes: I need an idea for a column.

LilMissEmu: I have a weird idea. You could write about how e-mail and IMing has become a new-age form of courtship. Instead of people way back when, who wrote letters in longhand and mailed them off to their loved ones until they saw each other, you have people who type up a quick e-mail to someone in a far away city and get a reply within minutes. It's the same thing; only nowadays, it's a lot faster. A nice story on how everything from the past reinvents itself.

JMontes: It's an interesting angle. I'm sure there are a lot of students who go through similar long distance relationships in college that have been aided tremendously by the internet. I just don't know if there's an entire column there.

LilMissEmu: Well, it doesn't have to be just on long-distance relationships. It can be on friendships and how the Internet has redefined the idea of "pen pals." Didn't you have to do a pen pal project back in elementary or middle school?

JMontes: Three times. Once, it was with some kids in some foreign country. That lasted all of two letters. The second was some stupid thing where we were supposed to write to "Romeo" or "Juliet" in Verona for love advice. I actually failed that one because I didn't have any questions for them.

LilMissEmu: Write to Romeo and Juliet about love? What would they know; they died!

JMontes: I know! The third thing was some stupid pen pal with a soldier in the Gulf War. Looks like we're going in again and he still hasn't replied.

LilMissEmu: My point was that so many people are meeting over the net now, and many of them fall in love. Look at us. If it hadn't been for IM, we might not have never met and gotten to be so close.

JMontes: Oh, I agree. But how could that be a column?

LilMissEmu: Well, it could be something like "is instant messaging the rebirth of letter writing, like our great-grandparents used to do?"

JMontes: God, I hope not.

LilMissEmu: Why?

JMontes: I can't imagine my great-grandmother ever dipping her quill into ink and writing "OMG! LOL! U R so funy! ^_^"

LilMissEmu: Ha ha! Come on. You never found that kind of stuff romantic? I think there's something to be said about pouring your heart out to someone in a letter to let him or her know how much you care for them.

JMontes: I don't think you can compare that to modern times. It's a different world.

LilMissEmu: Why?

JMontes: Back then, you at least met a person and got to know them through your correspondence.

LilMissEmu: And what's so different now?

JMontes: The Internet cheapens the whole thing. There's no more effort to be put into the matter. You just type up your thoughts while you read the latest comics and chat with friends, click send and boom, you're exchanging love letters. Before, there was all this time and caring and effort put into a letter. E-mails manage to be both informal and impersonal. And IMs are no different. It's like falling in love over the phone.

LilMissEmu: So are you saying that you don't believe in people falling in love over the Internet?

JMontes: I believe it's a lot easier to fall in love over the Internet. Too easy. You can delude yourself into love at the drop of a hat. Oh sure, it can happen. Love on the net. I believe that. 

But eventually, two people have to test a relationship without the modem, and if you ask me, that's the only time it should even be considered a relationship. If you're involved with someone and it goes long distance, that's one thing. But to start in that long-distance form from the getgo…

JMontes: I just don't trust love enough to digitize it.

LilMissEmu: Sounds like you've got a column right there.

JMontes: I guess I do. The problem is now to organize all these thoughts and get it to be about 700 words long.

LilMissEmu: You could always just copy-and-paste our conversation.

JMontes: I might just do that.

Headline: Israeli claim to land unfounded
Author: Andy Diaz/Senior Columnist
&nbsp;
Last Wednesday, I attended a question-and-answer session with Elli Wohlgelernter, editor of The Jerusalem Post's Diaspora Affairs. The session was billed as "an up-to-date view on how the United States, Israel and the Palestinian authority are looking at the current situation." 

Theoretically, it sounded interesting enough. But I had no illusions of it being an unbiased presentation of the situation in the Middle East; rather, I assumed it would be an attempt by pro-Israeli organizations to turn the tide of "anti-Israel activity" in American universities. 

I agree with the Israeli government that there's been a growing feeling of anti-Semitism on college campuses across America. I don't believe, however, that it is to the extent that the Israeli government would have us think. 

Regardless of degree, anti-Semitism (and for that matter any other kind of racism) should be condemned in all its forms. On that note, I should also point out that there is what can easily be characterized as anti-Palestinian sentiments on our campus, which I experienced firsthand at this event.

Some of the students who attended the event spoke of the Palestinian people with a certain disdain, as though they were no more than a cancer that needed to be taken care of. 

At one point, when someone asked who was protecting the Palestinian City of Gaza, a man sitting to my right remarked, "What's there to protect?" Apparently 200,000 Palestinians aren't exactly worth protecting according to his standards. 

A distraught girl, among cries of "Send him a missile!" &#8211; a reference to a leader of Hamas' military wing &#8211; asked of Palestinians living in Israel: "If the Arab countries didn't want them, why did we take them in?" "They were already there!" I screamed back, unable to control myself any longer.

A large number of Israelis &#8211; including the girl from the previous paragraph &#8211; and Palestinians are convinced the land from the Mediterranean to the Jordan belongs to them, and there's absolutely no reason to give up any of it. This is partly due to ignorance indoctrinated through religion and partly to their governments' reluctance to disclaim the biblical myths that have kept these two people at war. 

In 1999, Ze'ev Herzog, Israeli archeologist and professor at Tel Aviv University, wrote a paper addressing his people's unwillingness to accept the historical fact that any biblical claim to the land is unfounded. "The Israelis were never in Egypt, did not wander in the desert, did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of Israel, " Herzog wrote. 

So if Zionism bases its reason for existing on religious myth, why has it been so successful? In one word, anti-Semitism. The true champion of Zionism was an English conservative politician named Alfred Balfour, an anti-Semite who believed that the only way to rid Britain of the Jews was to give them a homeland. 

The Zionist movement was actually started by an Austrian Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who, appalled by France's public opinion during the Dreyfus Affair, realized that the Jewish people would never live in harmony with the rest of the world, and they would need a Jewish state. Of course, he presupposed that this land was not inhabited already by Palestinian Arabs. 

Not all Jews, however, support the Zionist movement. In fact, in its early stages it was mostly Jews who opposed it. More recently Neturei Karta, a sect of Orthodox Jews who are staunch opponents of Zionism, have been seen protesting the state of Israel carrying the flag of the Palestine Liberation Organization alongside Palestinians. Their argument is that according to the Jewish Bible, the Jews will return to their homeland with the arrival of their messiah. Because no Jewish messiah has arrived &#8211; that they know of &#8211; there's no comprehensive biblical basis for the state of Israel either.

I'm a bit more pragmatic and believe that an Israeli state and a Palestinian state can coexist.  Since the rebirth of the Palestinian liberation movement of the late '80s, over a 1,000 innocent Palestinians and almost 800 Israelis have been killed. 

That is the current reality of the Middle East. Many more innocents will meet a similar fate if these two groups don't abandon their religious hangups and recognize each other's secular rights to the land.

SGC president retracts housing bill

To the editor:

The Student Government Council wants to make it clear that the voice of the student body has not gone unheard as it relates to the Housing Bill. As of this week, I have decided to retract the Housing Bill from the table. Furthermore, I will veto the bill if pursued by the legislature.  

The Student Government Council at the Biscayne Bay Campus and Vice President Alexander Lewy and I have no intention of forwarding initiatives that the student body feels is not appropriate.  We would like to reproach The Beacon, however, for their continuous lack of balance in covering this issue.  

To date, no one from The Beacon has interviewed either Mr. Lewy or myself on this matter.  Yet, The Beacon continues to present unbalanced and unsubstantiated opinions.  For example, had The Beacon spoken to one of the student government officers they would know that the Housing Bill is not intended for Mr. Lewy and I.  The bill would be enacted next year, for the next student government administration.  

Nevertheless, we appreciate the remarks of The Beacon, for all are entitled to an opinion.  Additionally, we would like to implore The Beacon and the student body to bring the same vigor, enthusiasm and opinions to the table on issues that are more pressing for the student body.

The class size reduction amendment, which will appear on the November ballot, is one such pressing issue. The Florida Student Association, the Student Government Association and many others foresee the great impact this bill, if passed, will have on higher education. This statewide bill will regulate the classroom size of K-12 schools to no more than 24, costing the state over $27 billion. $22.5 billion will be cut from higher education, forcing the university to seek other avenues of generating funds.  In other words, tuition will go up and financial aid and Bright Futures will go down.  The Student Government Council is interested in knowing how the student body feels about the classroom size amendment.  

The Student Government Council, again, would like to thank all for their comments.  We also anticipate The Beacon and the student body channeling the same energy expressed about the Housing Bill to other pressing issues.  Go Gold!

Reader defends stance on housing issues

To the editor:

I write in response to aspersions against my good name written in last week's Beacon by Jorge Montes.  He suggests that I claim "that the SGC president and vice-president are entitled to housing because the President of the United States is," and refers to that claim as "downright laughable," ascribing it to my supposedly gargantuan ego.  It is an old newspaperman's trick to remove a few of the more sensible lines from a letter to the editor with which the paper disagrees, and then rebut the letter for not making sense.  Not that I'm suggesting that such a thing has occurred in this case... but the letter which I originally wrote to The Beacon was apparently trimmed for space in a way that lends credence to criticism.  I had, in fact, noted therein that not only the President, but also "all state governors, many lieutenant governors and even a good number of mayors" receive housing along with the job – in short, that housing is indeed a 'perk' that comes with the peculiar burdens of holding an elected executive office.  

Having worked with a number of mayors, I have come to realize that the president of the student government at a university the size of our own is functionally similar in workload and assigned civic responsibilities to a mayor for a town of equivalent size.  Consequently, I feel that those who hold the executive positions in student government should be treated not as presidents with mansions or helicopters, but as mayors of the small town that we share.  In that analysis, a free dorm room – at no expense to the student body – is simply not a disproportionate benefit.  I would add that I have no personal relationship with any current executive officeholder in student government, nor do I anticipate seeking such office again.  I therefore have no personal stake in the outcome of this debate, except to assert what I believe would benefit the student body, based on over 10 years of experience at various levels within this university – as an undergraduate, a graduate and law student, a teaching assistant, an advisor in the School of Journalism, a participant in all possible manner of civic activities and even as a writer for The Beacon.

Headline: In Our View:  Board of Govenors should not replace current system
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The FIU Board of Trustees recent decision to oppose the Graham Amendment is in the best interest of the university.  If the proposed amendment is passed, the results for FIU and the state university system in general will be devastating.  

Under the current system, power over each public university is vested in its respective board of trustees, which are each comprised of 13 members who are usually local leaders.  All of the current FIU trustees reside in Miami and are familiar with the institution and its needs.  With the enactment of the Graham Amendment, the system would, in essence, return to the way it was prior to 2001, with the governance of all 11 of Florida public universities residing in the hands of a single, 17 member Board of Governors (formerly called the Board of Regents).  The local voice that is present in the current system would largely go unheard under the Board of Governors.  

In addition, the current trustee boards are more efficient and responsive in addressing issues of concern to the university.  There is less red tape under the current system than there would be under the Board of Governors.  

Consequently, contracts and academic programs can be approved faster and put into effect sooner.  The former Board of Regents was one of the longest standing obstacles in the formation of the law school.  If the Board of Governors takes the reins, the chances of FIU getting a medical school sometime in the near future will diminish significantly.

Finally, the Board of Regents was notorious for favoring older, established, rural universities, such as University of Florida and Florida State University, over newer, urban universities like FIU.  If the Graham Amendment is passed, these newer universities will continue to get the short end of the stick in funding. The current system allows all state universities to compete on more equal grounds.

The current system has not been in effect long enough to foretell whether or not it is the best option for the university governing system. But the old system was clearly flawed, and the proposed Board of Governors seems to possess the same problems as the Board of Regents did.  The current system should be given a chance to prove itself before a new system is once again enacted.

Headline: Trustees oppose Amendment 11
Author: Sara Henderson
&nbsp;
In an emergency conference call meeting on Thursday, FIU's Board of Trustees unanimously voted to formally oppose Amendment 11, a bill that would restructure the way that Florida's public universities are governed. The vote comes in response to official statements issued recently by other universities.

"The University of Central Florida has come out with a statement stating ...its position regarding the Graham Amendment," Armando Codina, Board of Trustees chairman, said at the opening of Thursday's meeting. "I think we need to come up with a public statement."  

Termed the Graham Amendment after Senator Bob Graham, its principal supporter, the bill provides for the addition of a Board of Governors and amends the way the current Board of Trustees is appointed.  

Under the Graham Amendment, the Board of Governors would consist of 17 members. 

The commissioner of education, the chairman of the state-wide faculty group and the president of the Florida Student Association will serve on the board.

The remaining 14 members would be appointed by the governor and will serve staggered seven-year terms.

The Board of Trustees will stay intact and will be comprised of 13 members, six appointed by the governor and five by the Board of Governors, all serving staggered five-year terms. Under the current system, the 12 trustees are appointed by the governor.

Trustees, students and university officials have conflicting views on the issue.

"I've studied the Graham Amendment and I see little in it that benefits FIU," trustee Alvah H. Chapman, Jr. said.  "It is an ill conceived venture that will not serve the interests of FIU."   

Trustee David Parker agreed.

"The Board of Trustees...have involved wise expenditure of funds. It is vital that the system stay as it is."

However, Brent Cout, senior, MIS,  finds fault with the way the current Board of Trustees has managed university funds and is in favor of returning to a system with a central governing body for the state's universities.

"Being an international student, it sucks because all tuition [at FIU] has gone up 20 percent."

Sanya Chack, junior, international relations agreed. "They don't listen to students' ideas about anything that concerns money."       

University and student officials are concerned about the consequences of Amendment 11 specific to FIU, giving the Board of Trustees credit for our law school and football team.  

"If it passed it could cause a lot of hardships on our university," Student Government Council President Jessica Morffi said.  "Currently we have a board of 13 members devoted to our university, its rights and making it prosperous."

Carlos Machado, junior, interior design, agrees. "I don't think it's necessary to bring [the board] back because the university is running well without [the Board of Governors]. They were one of the main people adamant against a law school at FIU."

Maidique agreed.  "After 14 years of fighting, we finally have a law school.  That law school is going to revolutionize our community." 

FIU's law school is the only public one serving South Florida.

He is also concerned about how the proposed Board of Governors could limit FIU's future. He sites "additional Ph.D.s, equitable funding, and annual budget allocation" as things the Board of Governors would prevent. 

"There are two dimensions: old versus. new...and urban versus. rural," he explained.  "We really have one old university in Florida and 12 new ones," he said, noting that the University of Florida would be the only school to really benefit from Amendment 11. "We should be compensated for the fact that we are in a high-cost urban area," he said.    

Morffi, Maidique and others are also concerned about losing members of the current Board of Trustees and the consequences that could result. 

"For the first time in the state of Florida, we have people in on our boards made of people in our community," Maidique said.  

"The chairman has said that if it [Amendment 11] is passed, he will not stay on the board because he will not be able to give input in the same way," Morffi said. "The very influential members of our board will not stay around."  

Maidique agreed. "We will lose the best people we have on our boards. We lose those people and we get weak people...who have no real power."  

Some students are neither opposed nor in favor of the amendment.  

"Sometimes you need someone over the university to re-evaluate.  Som schools don't run like they should; I don't really know if this university is or not," Coline Prudent, senior, health and human services/pre-med said. "We should re-evaluate the reasons [the state government] eliminated the Board of Regents."

Headline: Founding journalism dean set to resign
Author: Vinora Murdock-Hamilton / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Journalism and Mass Communication Dean J. Arthur Heise, has announced his resignation effective at the end of the 2002-2003 school year. 

"I made my decision in June but held back on the announcement until faculty members had an opportunity to hear it from me instead of a memo or an e-mail," he said.

Heise, 63, said he is waiting until the end of the current school year because he wants to ensure that the transition to a new dean will be a smooth one. 

He said he has been at FIU for almost three decades.  He is leaving to persue personal projects.

"This is a chance for me to decompress, to smell the roses," Heise, a sports car enthusiast, said. "In the 28 years that I have been at FIU I have never taken a sabbatical." 

He also plans on writing a book.

 "This one will describe my experiences when I first came to the United States in 1953 and also the great effort that I made to regain the home my family lost when the Red Army descended on the suburbs of Berlin in 1945."

Heise has already written two books: "Minimum Disclosure: How the Pentagon Manipulates the News," in 1979 and "The Brass Factories: A Frank Appraisal of West Point Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy" in 1969. 

He has also published numerous articles and co-authored the "Annual FIU/Florida Poll" which is a tool used by public officials and business people to help determine the direction of the state and to learn more about the opinion of residents.

Before assuming leadership of SJMC, Heise, a former reporter and editor with the Buffalo NY News and the Associated Press in Berlin, served twice as chair of the Department of Public Administration. He also founded the Institute for Public Opinion Research and aided in the foundation of what is now known as the College of Health and Urban Affairs.

SJMC Associate Dean Dr. Lillian Kopenhaver has worked with Heise since he came to FIU in 1974.   

"Dean Heise is a forceful leader who always had a strong vision," Kopenhaver said. "He worked hard to ensure that the School of Journalism developed a strong professionally-oriented program that would prepare students for work in any aspect of the mass communication industry." 

Under Heise's guidance, FIU developed a journalism program that is ranked in the top  25 percent of the nearly 400 accredited programs in the country. 

Six graduates of SJMC have participated in works that captured journalism's coveted Pulitzer Prize; one of them, Miami Herald's columnist Liz Balmaseda, winning it alone.

"No one else could have taken a journalism program this far in terms of national reputation in such a short period of time," Mike McQueen, SJMC Journalism Department chair, said. "FIU has graduates working as top editors and news directors at some of the finest media outlets in the country." 

McQueen said this is the result of Heise's vision that FIU, a state-funded institution with a high minority population, can compete with older and more well-known schools in the country.

Provost Mark Rosenberg says the loss of Heise will definitely be felt throughout the school.

"The dean has fulfilled every promise that he made to us, and his shoes will be hard to fill," Rosenberg said.

Heise said he is satisfied with the work he has done for SJMC.

"Six months after accepting the role as head of the school I knew that we either had to discontinue the program or turn the school into a first class institution with national recognition," he said.

Once the decision was made to keep the school open, the dean and his faculty set out to ensure three things: SJMC must attract the top minority students in the state, the school must be professionally oriented, and the school must gain national recognition.

"Our students now have a wonderful opportunity to acquire the skills needed to compete with others in the business," Heise said. "I am happy that I was able to make a small contribution to that." 

In 1988, SJMC was awarded FIU's largest federal grant – $13.5 million for a 10-year Latin American Journalism Project. 

These funds are distributed in an effort to bolster the quality of journalism in Central America and have helped to establish a self-sufficient journalism training center in Panama. 

"This grant was a direct consequence of Dean Heise's leadership and entrepreneurial efforts," Rosenberg said. 

Department of Advertising and Public Relations Chair Pat Rose said Heise is a wonderful human being with a strong sense of fairness, one who is always willing to hear both sides of a story.

"The dean has always been supportive of the department of Advertising and Public Relations considering that his background is that of a journalist," Rose said. "He is always open to ideas presented by the faculty, and, above all, he is genuinely concerned about the students."

"The dean is a teacher and a mentor who spent time with me and encouraged me," Jasmine Kripalani, a graduate of SJMC and a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter for The Miami Herald, said. 

The resignation of Dean Heise comes as a surprise to many students. Some feel that SJMC has not done a good job of keeping students abreast of the things that are happening within the school.	

"We have been so busy working to ensure that the school continues to succeed that we sometimes forget to tell our story," Heise said. "I have a [student] advisory committee that keeps me up-to-date on the things that are happening in the classrooms, and we are improving our website to provide better information."

Heise said he feels that one of the drawbacks to this communication is the fact that a majority of the students come to school and leave immediately for work or other activities.

"There is great value in being able to spend time over a cup of coffee with a professor," the dean said. "I encourage students to work as little as possible and spend more time on their education."

 Michelle Walker, a senior in the print journalism track, expressed concern about the effect that the dean's departure will have on the school. 

"There have been a number of changes to the journalism program over the years that I have been here," she said. "Does this mean that more changes will be underway?" Walker said.

"Change is inevitable, but we are working hard to make sure that the impact on students is minimal," Heise said.

A search for Heise's successor will commence in late October after the completion of the journalism re-accreditation review.

How will the decision be made as to who replaces  Heise?

"We plan to meet with faculty and students, and get them involved in the process," Rosenberg said.

Headline: Students break Walk on Water record
Author: Adriana Oliva / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Combating extreme heat and humidity, architect students defied the laws of physics as they struggled to walk across a 300 foot wide murky lake behind the Green Library on Wednesday afternoon. This  year marks the 15th anniversary of  the school of architecture's Walk on Water competiton.  

Pina Del Conte and Cristina Rivera, two of 57 student in the  Methods of Construction class broke the previous year's record, crossing in just 1:16.

The assignment, to design a pair of shoes to walk on water,  was given at the beginning of the semester and is worth 20 percent of the students' grade.  This amount is equivalent to one test grade.

"Most of the time the students think I'm kidding, and I get parents coming in and telling me I'm crazy," Jaime Canavés, director of research for the FIU School of Architecture, said.

To fulfill the requirements for the assignment, students had to design and construct a pair of shoes to walk across water. Pedaling is not allowed. Objects that were not attached to shoes, such as fins or paddles could not be used. 

"We spent over 40 hours planning, designing and working on the shoes and around $150 on materials,"a triumphant Del Conte said.

 Most of the students' shoes were made of foam, wood, Plexiglas, PVC pipes, and duck tape to stop the foam from breaking apart in the lake. 

Grades were  determined according to the distance crossed. If students made it all the way to the end, they received an "A" and got to drop a test grade. Markers in the water designated grades. As  students passed them, they earned the marked grade.

"Hopefully everyone was at least able to make it to the "D" mark; it wasn't that far away," Canavés said.

Del Conte and Rivera received a first place award of $500,  sponsored by the Miami chapter of the American Institute of Architects. 

Second place went to Eduardo Calil and Manuel Rodriguez with a time of 2:14. Third place went to Dane Yankowich and Alexis Hamilton with a time 2:48.

This year not all winners received cash prizes. Second and third place winners received two architecture books supplied by Coti Imports magazine.

All but four of the teams left the finish line. 

"I think it was great how there were so many people out by the lake supporting the students and motivating them to finish," Frances Varona, sophomore, biology,  said.

One of students' main concerns is lake sanitation. 

"Although I thought it was extremely funny that people were falling in, I felt really bad because that's not the cleanest water in the world,"

Canavés assured his students that the lake is tested for bacteria and that nothing detrimental has been found. 

"I just tell my students that it's not a test to see how much water they can drink, to just keep their mouths closed," Canavés said.

"My initial reaction was that the lake was disgusting, but I was really excited from the beginning," architecture major Diana Mackay said.

Although students were allowed to work in teams of two, only one team member had to do the walking. 

FIU students started walking on water 15 years ago. 

"Traditionally, in basic architect design classes at architecture schools the assignment is to make a canoe out of cardboard and make it float in a race," Canavés said. "I, however, thought that the students here at FIU were more special and could do something different, so I came up with them having to create shoes to walk on water." 
  In the years to come, Canavés hopes to have some competition.

"We've challenged the University of Miami and our own school of engineering but no one has yet taken us up on our offer," he said.

Headline: "Rules of attraction" repels
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Until now, I had never really watched a movie that I felt truly undeserving of, at the very least, a review, whether it be good or bad. However, after watching Roger Avary's "The Rules of Attraction," a horrid two-hour feature based on a novel by the very over-rated Brett Easton Ellis ("American Psycho"), I can honestly say this film does not deserve any review at all; in fact, even the worst one imaginable would not do this tripe justice. It should be stored away at some museum for terrible movies, showcased for future generations as an example of the cinematic mistakes we've made so that they may learn to avoid them.

If you can make sense out of the jumble of characters milling around living out their undeveloped lives, you'll find a story that's somewhat told through the eyes of Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon), a college student whose most important feature seems to be the fact that she's a virgin throughout most of the movie.  She manages to catch the eye of Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), a fellow student who also happens to be the campus drug dealer.  Bateman falls for her in his own miserable way under the false impression that she is the person behind anonymous love letters he receives, looks forward to reading and smells while masturbating.  Despite starting out as the narrator, the film abandons Lauren randomly, sometimes focusing solely on Bateman, while other times leaving both of them entirely to focus on the many other characters, including Victor (Kip Pardue), the drama student returning from a summer in Europe, Paul (Ian Somerhalder), the gay guy who can't seem to get any, Lara (Jessica Biel), who other than being Lauren's roommate the film doesn't develop to be anything more than a slut, and a host of other characters who pop in and out randomly.

The film is a prime example of what happens when so-called dark comedies go bad. It presents you with a group of miserable people living miserable lives and believes that that's simply enough to make you laugh at times and care about the characters. The fact is, it's not.

 A good dark comedy is a subtle, fragile thing.  When it's too over the top, you run the risk of creating characters that are simply to inhumane and one-dimensional to be realistic or worthy of caring about.  

Even the most evil of characters can have layers, and the one's that do are generally the most interesting. Unfortunately, "The Rules of Attraction" gives us characters that would have to work at being one-dimensional, and the one's that show some potential, Paul for example, they don't devote enough time to. What we are left with are characters like Bateman, who seem to have nothing else to go on, nothing driving them but their own misery. 

The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that for the most part the acting wasn't bad and the direction was interesting at times. What kills "The Rules of Attraction" is the writing, or lack thereof. It doesn't matter if you have the best actors starring in a movie directed by the best director; if you have poor character development and no plot to speak of, the story will go nowhere. 

This film does just that. It strings you along for two hours, throwing in random scenes that have nothing to do with anything (take for example the scene wherein Paul and a gay friend dance in their underwear on a bed to George Michael's "Faith" or the scene where Bateman takes a dump), and in the end, the film goes absolutely nowhere. In a way, I can see the scene where Bateman does his business as an on-screen reference to the process of writing this movie. I can imagine Avary wiping his ass with a piece of paper and calling it a screenplay. In fact, the story is so devoid of direction that you can actually spot the moment where Avary realized it wasn't going anywhere and didn't know where to end it. As a result, the film just ends, almost as if he picked a random moment to stop filming. I'm not exaggerating either – the film actually ends in mid-sentence.  

After sitting through a pointless tirade for two hours, the ending was nothing short of a slap in the face. Well, turnabout is fair play. So, to sum up, all I can say, is that "Rules of Attraction" is nothing short of the biggest piece of sh...

Headline: Red Hot Chili Peppers mature - somewhat
Author: Claudia Ortega
&nbsp;
By the Way, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' newest release, is being touted as a step up for the band.  It's good for bands to explore new ground, but the spunk and uplifting spontaneity of the Chili Peppers' old sound, which does appear sparingly throughout the album, should have been more dominant.  

But then again, I guess I belong to the group of fans who just prefer the hard, shocking Chili Peppers.  It's easy to hear the change that everyone is talking about – about as easy as it is to hear the lack of passion that used to drive their albums. 

By the Way is not particularly bad, it's just not as good as it could be. Like so many other musicians and bands before them, the Chili Peppers seem to be losing the fire that has electrified their music in the past.  

Sure, a mellow By the Way does open up the door for a wider range of approval; with the absence of bad words or sexual references, it's not that far-fetched that even your parents could like it.

"Growing up," however, apparently means playing more lack-luster ballads that slow the progress of the whole album. I've heard that the lyrics to some of these songs are introspective and deep, but I can't help losing interest at certain points, leaving little chance to notice what it is Anthony Kiedis is singing about. "Midnight," a painful song to have to sit through, is a good example.

The unique and unequivocal Chili Pepper sound isn't entirely lacking on this album; there are parts in which classic Kiedis or classic Flea shine through.  And there are a variety of melodies and themes among the 16 tracks - including ska-influenced "On Mercury," a Latin-flavored "Cabron" and a rhythmically vigorous "Throw Away Your Television" – with lyrics I did notice. "Throw away your television/take the noose off your ambition/reinvent your intuition now." It's not one of the best songs, but not being a big fan of television (ever read "Fahrenheit 451"?), I appreciated it.  

"Can't Stop" showcases classic Chili Pepper style. Kiedis launches into it with his singing-rapping trademark, while Flea backs him up with an aggressive, funky bass line. The change into the chorus is smooth and flows with the song, unlike many of the other tracks.  The reggae-like breakdown in the middle is also a nice touch.

The Latin-flavored, acoustic "Cabron" is the album's "fun" song.  It's the kind of song you could blast on the way to the beach on a sunny day. Kiedis' voice is particularly sweet in this song, when he sings "I don't want to fight, I wanna get along with you," you feel like you could forgive him anything.

"Zephyr Song" and "Warm Tape" both have a dreamy feel, although the latter is better; once again, Kiedis' voice is exceptional, sultrily singing the opening line "Shiver for me." The attempt at ska, "On Mercury," bombs; they should definitely stay away from that genre, while "Universally Speaking" is not only mundane, but unfortunately patently pop.

By the Way is a continuation of where Californication left off. I guess I can't really knock them for growing up, and although the first time I heard it, I wasn't impressed at all, the album has really grown on me. At least they're still making music together; at least they haven't totally sold out their fans.

Headline: "Transporter" delivers mindless action
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
I see action; I see France; I see Jason Statham's underpants. And if that's not enough for "The Transporter" to get your attention, there's also a very hot sex scene, some really cool explosions and car chases so fast, the starship Enterprise couldn't keep up with them. If all you're looking for is action, suspense and a little style, then "The Transporter" is the movie for you. 

There's just one thing missing: a good plot. The one it has isn't too bad, but it could have used a lot more work. It starts off very good and quickly builds on that until about halfway through the picture. Then it just seems to level out right there and not grow anymore. The ending is mediocre at best. Corey Yuen, director of numerous successful films from his homeland of China, needed to put just a little more thought into this one.

Ah, the French Mediterranean, truly one of the best places on Earth. The crisp air, the beautiful beaches, the good food and lots of good decent people. Of course, there're also plenty of bad people; otherwise Frank Martin (Jason Statham, from "Snatch") would be out of a job. Frank is a professional transporter, a mercenary who transports goods, people and other "questionable" items from place to place without any trouble.  He's very good at what he does, calculating everything from the distance he has to travel to the weight of the package. He has only three simple rules, which he takes very seriously: 1. Never change the deal. 2. No Names. 3. Never open the package. 

Frank is approached in a bar one evening by some very shady  people. They want to hire him to transport a package to their boss, an American gangster known only as "Wall Street" (Matt Schulze). He lays out the terms and the deal is set. The next day, he arrives on time for his pick-up. They put a large duffel bag in his trunk and he's off. To him, this is just another job, but then he's struck by fate in the form of a flat tire. He opens the trunk to get the spare and is surprised to see the duffel bag wiggling around and making funny noises. Frank Martin is a strict follower of his rules, and has never broken them, not even once. Why does he have to pick this moment to start? He opens the duffel bag and inside he finds a young and very beautiful Chinese girl (Qi Shu) bound and gagged. This is when everything starts to go wrong.

Some of the other characters are pointless and just seem to be in the way, like Inspector Tarconi (played by Francois Berleand). First he's out to catch Frank committing a crime and the next thing you know they're good friends. Despite its seriously flawed story, I found this movie to be very entertaining. I had no idea Jason Statham could move like he does in the film. The fight scenes are very good, especially the one where he uses a barrel of motor oil and bike pedals to fight six or seven tough guys. Now that's creative, like a cross between Jean-Claude Van Damme and MacGyver. He even looks good behind the wheel of that car, and when you add in the speeding car footage and special effects, he reminds you of a British Vin Diesel.

Headline: New FIU production evokes tears, laughter
Author: By Krystal Alvarez
&nbsp;
Take a walk into "Marvin's Room." The famous off-Broadway play written by Scott McPherson is being performed in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center on campus. The cast has been rehearsing since September 3, and the curtain finally goes up Thursday-Sunday, October 17-20 and 24-27.

Business Manager Abel Cornejo described the play as "hilarious and enlightening. It deals with death, something everyone must face."

Set in Florida, Bessie(Katie Perry) is coping with taking care of her aunt (Crystal Edn) and her invalid father, Marvin (Matt Symanski). Bessie learns she has leukemia. As if that wasn't enough, she needs a bone marrow transplant from her sister (Karen Garcia), with whom she has not spoken to in years. At this point, Bessie's life seems to be at its worse and everything she knows about her family is about to change.

"'Marvin's Room' tries to show how even when life is it's most difficult, some good comes out of it," says Katie Perry (Bessie).

Other characters adding to the dynamic of the story include Bessie's wacky physician, Dr. Wally and her rebellious son Hank. Dr. Wally is played by Meshuan Arnold, who recently worked on Mosaic's Theatre's production of "Cobb," and Ivan Lopez plays Hank. The director of "Marvin's Room" is university veteran Therald Todd. Todd has been working here 23 years and has produced and estimated 40 plays. His most recent work was Arthur Miller's "The Crucible."

This dark, sentimental play was one of the late McPherson's most prized works. He was one of the first openly gay, HIV positive artists of his time. Writing works like "Marvin's Room" became a cathartic experience that allowed McPherson to convey the need for support from family when faced with a chronic illness. He also touches on the importance of laughing in times of grief.

When asked why there was so much humor in the would-be drama, McPherson stated, "The realities the characters face are overwhelming, so without humor, the play would be too dark."

This becomes the rationale for the insertion of the dark wit in the play. Although this play deals with the serious issues of death and family relationships, it has very distinct humor. 

The play is saturated with absurd situations that will have the audience laughing at the most unexpected moments.

One example of humor is when Bessie hears life-changing news about her condition. This is certainly a very delicate moment in Bessie's life but she gets to hear of her cancer from her incompetent, distracted doctor. 

Humor is carefully intertwined with the dramatic moments in a very tasteful manner.

"Marvin's Room" is a great opportunity to see McPherson's slew of unique characters come to life on stage. The audience will find themselves engrossed and amused in the poignant yet comical scenes. This is a wonderful chance to support fellow students, who have dedicated a lot of time and effort into the making of "Marvin's Room," and to experience great theatre.
