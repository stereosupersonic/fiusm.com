Headline: Honors graduate makes FIU history as first Truman Scholar
Author: C. Joel Marino
&nbsp;
From congratulatory phone calls to a special parade held in her honor, Kelsey Renee Vaughan, an international relations major, has been receiving plenty of praise after officially becoming the first FIU student to be awarded the prestigious Harry S. Truman Scholarship.

"I'm receiving emails from people I've never even met before," said Vaughan in a press release. "Everyone is so happy for me. It's great."

The Truman Scholarship is a highly competitive award recognizing college juniors and seniors dedicated to careers in public service, including government positions, education, and involvement in non-profit or advocacy sectors.

Students are nominated by their institutions based on proven leadership skills, intellectual ability and commitment to "making a difference" in their planned area of study. After passing through several interviews held by regional selection panels, the finalists receive a scholarship worth $2,000 for their senior year and $24,000 for graduate work.

Vaughan is only one of two winners picked this year from Florida schools, the other student being from the University of Florida. At the national level, she joins 77 other award recipients chosen from 609 nominations and 200 finalists. 

Overall, it was the role Vaughan played while participating in an internship with the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia last summer that led to her win in the final Boston-based interviews. For her internship, she worked on issues dealing with human trafficking and underage prostitution, issues she admits the administration had never even examined before. Also key to her work was finding the causes for the increasing phenomenon.

"As long as there is poverty in Bolivia, there will be underage prostitution," she said. "The larger issue is really the poverty."

After her work with the embassy, Vaughan wrote a policy statement for the Truman Scholarship recommending the formation of an international coalition to control human trafficking.

A third year Honors Student, Vaughan enlisted the help of both Honors College teachers and other members of the faculty in order to compose the proposal, as well as in preparation for various aspects of the competition, such as the composition of recommendation letters and mock interviews held to ready her for the real thing.

It was for this reason that Dr. Ivelaw L. Griffith, Dean of the Honors College, arranged a special convocation ceremony in the Marc Building's lobby on April 8.

The ceremony started with a parade held in Vaughan's honor and remarks from different members of the FIU administration.

"We can strive to have the best professors and the best facilities, but in the end it is students like Kelsey who make universities shine," said Provost Mike B. Rosenberg.

Vaughan will be graduating later this month, planning to pursue a graduate degree in International Development Studies. 

Her goals include working for a development organization after completing her graduate studies in order to "improve the quality of the lives of people victimized by poverty."

Headline: Graduating public health student starts non-profit HIV center
Author: FIU press release
&nbsp;
As an acute care nurse, Vanessa Mills used to take care of one patient at a time. Lately, though, she's decided to focus on entire groups of people using what she has learned through her studies in the Stempel School of Public Health at Florida International University.

In 1999 she formed a non-profit organization called Empower U, care which she describes as "founded by HIV positive people for HIV positive people." The 48-year-old mother of two and new grandmother was herself diagnosed with HIV in 1991.

 In the last two years, she has realized considerable success with her grant writing and today employs 13 people who provide HIV testing, counseling, care and prevention work in South Florida's poorest communities.  

"We target neighborhoods where drug use is prevalent," says Mills. "We look for hot spots, we literally count crack houses, abandoned houses with broken windows. We watch out for drug transactions and sex workers getting in and out of cars."

And that's where Empower U sets up shop. Last year, for example, Empower U tested 228 neighborhood residents for HIV and 19 of them turned out to be positive.  

"We connect them to care," says Mills. "And we work with them to stop them from transmitting HIV to anyone else."

One of her public health professors at FIU, Tim Patton, says that her approach has really impressed him.  

"She has a basic philosophical difference with most programs out there," Patton explains. "Most are focused on medical services for HIV patients. Vanessa is going out of her way to make the point that people with HIV can help stop the spread of the disease."

Empower U is one of seven HIV-related programs in Miami-Dade County currently being reviewed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention for a new initiative for community-based HIV prevention projects. A positive review from the CDC could lead to nearly $2.5 million dollars in funding over the next five years. 

Empower U began with a $9,040 sub contract in December 2001. In less than two years, the agency's annual funding has grown to almost $500,000. 

The staff has also grown from the two founders - Mills and her best friend, the late Petera Johnson - to 13 individuals including outreach worker, case managers, peer educators, housing specialists and an administrative consultant.

"Finally we are looking at people with HIV as central to halting the spread of the infection," says Mills. "Sounds simple but you can only get HIV from someone who has it. That's the key."  Empower U also offers confidential testing and counseling services in the community. 

Growing up poor and Black in Georgia, Mills says she figured out early on that to go where she wanted to go in life, she had to be educated. Since 1986, she worked per-diem at many hospitals in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. 

In 2002 she earned her nursing degree from Barry University. In the fall of that same year she enrolled in the Master's of Public Health program at FIU.    

When she receives her Master's degree on April 26th, her children, Glenn Alvin, 22 and Sean Christopher, 8 will be in the stands at the Golden Panther Arena to cheer her on.

Headline: Student's passion for politics leads to promising future
Author: FIU press release
&nbsp;
While growing up in Hialeah, Melissa Sanchez shared two passions: her father and politics. 

Her parents immigrated from Nicaragua. Although Sanchez's father Manuel Sanchez was an attorney in his native land, his dreams and aspirations took a back seat to his new life. He took several jobs in order to support his family. 

Growing up Sanchez recalls  how her father instilled a passion for learning and the political process. 

"He always made us look at things with a critical perspective and then encouraged us to get involved," recalls Sanchez.

Sanchez is about see her hard work to pay off when she graduates this spring with a 4.0 in political science from FIU. 

She admits that competing with herself and maintaining her hard work has not been easy. 

While working towards her bachelor's in political science, Sanchez has simultaneously been working on two minors in International Relations and Psychology.  

Keeping her father's lessons in mind, Sanchez jumped at the opportunity to be part of the political process when she interned in U.S. Senator Bill Nelson's Miami office.  

"I really came to appreciate the power and significance of the constitution," said Sanchez. 

During her time at FIU, she was able to hold down a part-time job at FIU's Governmental Relations Office. This led to Sanchez's internships at FIU's Washington office in the Fall. But her ultimate dream is to go to law school, which she will start in the Fall off 2005.

Headline: New SGA presidents: Q&A
Author: Vanessa Gomez
&nbsp;
Ruth Webster

  BBC president



What are your main goals for this year?

My goals for this year are to make the intercampus shuttle free to all students, increase class offerings at BBC, improving customer service on campus, strengthening the relationship between SGC-BBC and FIU administrative staff, improving the relationship between both councils, continuing the fight to keep our tuition low.   



What is your opinion on the lack of SGA student involvement at BBC this year?

I feel as if the lack of participation in elections was due to the fact that many people were not aware of the deadlines for applications as well as the lack of communication about elections within the department.



How do you plan to stimulate involvement?

First, I plan to reach out to our new students both freshman and transfer to get them involved. I also plan to improve SGC's presence on campus. Have more events where we are out there interacting with the students because the more they see that what we do directly affects them the more likely they will respond. Therefore, we can get more of them interested in becoming members of the council to help make a difference on our campus.



How do you plan to make up for the absence of a vice president?

It is definitely going to be hard without a vice president. What I will do is use the time I have in the summer to get things in place. I will have a lot of work to do but, I don't mind. I trust that when chosen my vice president will be one I can work with.



What challenges do you think that will present and how do you plan to deal with them?

There will be many challenges, and I will have quite a bit of work to do. However, the members I have on the Council will have to help during the absence of a VP.



As president, how do you plan to deal with the absence of David Cole?

This upcoming year we will be working closely with Rafael Zapata. He will sit in for Mr. Cole in his absence. We have plans to meet regularly and we communicate very well. 



How  would you describe your relationship with UP SGA? 

My relationship with UP SGA is ok. Now that I am president, I will be in constant contact with my counterpart Jorge in an effort to get to know him better to facilitate a better relationship. Over the past couple of years the relationship between the councils has not been the greatest, and there have always been promises to "have a better relationship", this year we are going to make it happen. 



How do you plan to improve on that?

I am going to maintain communication between Jorge and myself. I think I am pretty easy to get along with so we shouldn't have any problems this year. With better communication coming from the top everyone else will be on the same page.



   Jorge Rosario

   UP president 



How do you plan to improve the UP/BBC "relationship"?

Malik and I are excited about some of the ideas we have to continue improving our relationship with BBC.  We want to program more events together so that both SGC's can establish a more active and efficient workin relationship.  We also want to bring back an event that was started about 3 years ago which involved an intercouncil softball game followed by a Barbeque.



What in your platform are you most passionate about for the upcoming year?

In regards to what we are most passionate about, it would probably have to be our lobbying efforts to save the Bright Future Scholarship and the Florida Prepaid Program.  These two programs benefit so many FIU students. 

Personally, it means a great deal to me considering that I am a recipient of both programs. 

I also have a younger brother that will be attending FIU in the Fall, and he too is on both programs. 

As you can see, the Bright Future Scholarship and the Florida Prepaid Program play a significant role in my family.

Headline: Palestinian Christians - tormented, persecuted, ethnically cleansed and alone
Subheadline:  
Author: a.ata@unimelb.edu.au
&nbsp;


Exodus of the 
Palestinian Christians 

Dear Sir/Madam
The Palestinian Christian is an endangered species. When the modern state of Israel was established there were about 400000 of us. Two years ago the number was down to 80000. Now it's down to 60000. At that rate, in a few years there will be none of us left. 
Palestinian Christians within Israel fare little better. On the face of it, their number has grown by 20000 since 1991. But this is misleading, for the census classification 'Christian' includes some 20000 recent non-Arab migrants from the former Soviet Union. 
So why are Palestinian Christians abandoning their homeland? 
We have lost hope, that's why. We are treated as non-people. Few outside the Middle East even know we exist, and those who do, conveniently forget. 
I refer, of course, to the American Religious Right. They see the modern Israel as a harbinger of the Second Coming, at which time Christians will go to Paradise, and all others (presumably including Jews) to Hell. To this end they lend military and moral support to Israel. 
Even by the double-dealing standards of international diplomacy this is a breathtakingly cynical bargain. It is hard to know who is using whom more: the Christian Right for offering secular power in the expectation that the Jewish state will be destroyed by a greater spiritual one; or the Israeli Right for accepting their offer. What we do know is that both sides are abusing the Palestinians. Apparently we don't enter into anyone's calculations. 
The views of the Israeli Right are well known: they want us gone. 
Less well known are the views of the American Religious Right. Strangely, they find the liberation Iraqis from a vile dictator just, but do not find it unjust for us to be under military occupation for 38 long years. Said Senator James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma): 'God Appeared to Abraham and said: "I am giving you this land,"the West Bank. This is not a political battle at all. It is a contest over whether or not the word of God is true.' 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) was even more forthright: 'I'm content to have Israel grab the entire West Bank... I happen to believe that the Palestinians should leave.' 
There is a phrase for this. Ethnic cleansing. 
So why do American Christians stand by while their leaders advocate the expulsion of fellow Christians? Could it be that they do not know that the Holy Land has been a home to Christians since, well... since Christ? 
Do not think I am asking for special treatment for Christians. Ethnic cleansing is evil whoever does it and to whomever it is done. Palestinian Christians: Anglican, Maronite Catholics, Orthodox, Lutherans, Armenians, Baptists, Copts and Assyrians have been rubbing shoulders with each other and with other religions: Muslims, Jews, Druze and (most recently) Baha'is for centuries. We want to do so for centuries more. But we can't if we are driven out by despair. 
What we seek is support: material, moral, political and spiritual. As Palestinians we grieve for what we have lost, and few people (the Ashkenazi Jews are one) have lost more than us. But grief can be assuaged by the fellowship of friends. 

(Signed Prof. Abe W. Ata is a 9th generation Christian Palestinian born in Bethlehem.

	MEMORANDUM


To: 	F..I.U. Beacon Newspaper
From: 	Student Johnny Sanchez 
Date: 	05/19/04
Subject: MPA students  united against Director  who prevents flow of Info.
CC : 	Dario Moreno PhD, Director of Metropolitan Center Downtown
Copy to :Professor Ramon Sanchez

As a Law student enrolled in the Masters of Public Administration certificate program, US citizen, paying tuition and a Viet Nam veteran; 
I wish to inform the lack of cooperation and arrogance displayed by Mr. Moreno, yesterday, 5/19/04; while visiting our facilities at the Metropolitan Center of which he is a Director.
Before arriving, I called Vanessa Brito and talked to Ms. J. Strube, both employees at the 
above mentioned Center, indicating my desire for data on Coral Springs City  Budget .
They mentioned the vast resources and even a library for us to use in the Public Adm. programs, to enhance our alma mater green library.
I arrived at 4pm, dressed up with tie, jacket and briefcase; presented my credentials at the door, a staff made copies of my info and resume; instructed to browse the library and leave the briefcase with secretary, I started to look at the shelves.
Seconds later, I requested assistance in the office adjacent to the library, asking for a specific data, while talking to this nice employee, I was abruptly interrupted by a guy in shirt with an air of superiority and arrogance in a high tone asking me Who I was?
I replied showing my picture Id, FIU card and Law school credentials.
The tone of who I was? To say the least sounded like a scolding almost barked at...
and as a soldier unafraid of bullies, I asked after showing him my credentials, Who he was?
Attitudes receives replies.
I don't like your tone, leave immediately or I call the police
The Public University has a big arrogant Director that considers the center his personal domain and the tone that he likes is who stays. Is this Cuba???
A person with a PhD, has given no priority to people skills and students looking for help
receive a 911 treatment like we are breaking into his personal books or Info.
Do we need to expose attitudes of Superiors, with picket line, Herald reports, etc?
I walked out immediately with no data, and our student assoc is requesting a meeting with his Supervisor if he has one, because in the University, we the students & the State pay Director's salary to help and motivate us and not the other way around. Abajo Castro

Headline: Possible Reinstatement of Military Draft
Subheadline:  
Author: fuent99@bellsouth.net
&nbsp;
Dear Beacon Editor:

The current Congress is quietly considering legislation which would reinstate the military draft.  Both young men and women would be included from ages 18-26, with no exemption for college students.  An option would be 2 years of service in civil defense or homeland security.

This bill is S. 89 in the Senate armed services committe, or HR 163 in the House.  This could affect each and every FIU student. I hope students will call or write their congress people (Senators Nelson or Graham, for example) and protest this legislation.

Sincerely,

Headline: KIDS COUNT
Subheadline:  
Author: shern@fmhi.usf.edu
&nbsp;
After reviewing the 2004 KIDS COUNT Data Book released this 
week by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, I feel encouraged by data 
on the well-being of Florida's children. Although we continue to lag 
behind the national average, there is good news for our state. We 
are getting better, and it's important to realize that progress is being 
made - even if through small steps. They are steps in the right 
direction.
While there is still much work to be done, the good news is that 
Florida has shown improvement between 1996 and 2001 in eight of 
the ten measures that KIDS COUNT uses in determining the well-
being of our nation's kids. The share of our children living in poverty 
decreased, the teen death rate dropped, and we were one of only a 
few states where the share of children living in a single-parent home 
fell. We should take pride in the fact that the well-being of Florida's 
children is steadily improving.
KIDS COUNT serves as an important resource in helping to track our 
progress and raise public awareness about concerns for our most at-
risk youth. This year, a major focus of the Kids Count data is the 18 - 
24 olds - particularly youth in this age group who are disconnected. 
The 18-24 year age range is a time of important transitions - from 
high school to college student, from student to employee. However, 
disconnected youth find it extremely difficult to become successful 
adults. They are not continuing in school or other training programs 
and have not obtained a job - especially a job with long term career 
opportunities. Data shows that in 2002, 14% of Florida's youth were 
in this category.
Disconnected youth are at high risk for poor outcomes including 
involvement in the welfare and criminal justice system. We must 
realize that simply because you turn 18, it doesn't mean that you no 
longer need supports and skills to achieve success. For these youth, 
it is more difficult to capitalize on opportunities and supports are 
needed to help insure success.
While all disconnected youth are at elevated risk for poor long term 
outcomes - outcomes that are likely to be repeated in their children - 
youth involved in the foster care and juvenile justice system are of 
particular concern. Their lack of ties to family and other social 
resources, their educational and economic disadvantage, as well as 
the trauma of detention, predict continuing struggles through 
adulthood. Criminal justice involvement, substance abuse, 
victimization, underemployment or unemployment are the likely 
outcomes for many in these most vulnerable groups. More must be 
done to assist them in their transition to adulthood.  
For the last 30 years, USF's Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health 
Institute has developed and tested techniques to promote positive 
youth outcomes. We've provided local, statewide and national 
leadership in identifying effective approaches and moving them into 
action.  While we have much to learn, we also have knowledge of 
effective prevention and treatment approaches that are not used. We 
must do better at implementing what we know will work and stopping 
programs that don't work.
While the information presented in this year's Data Book is 
encouraging for Florida and the nation, we still have much to do. We 
have an opportunity to do well by doing good - to help avoid the 
costs of poor adult outcomes and maximize everyone's contribution 
to their community.

David Shern is the Dean of the Louis de la Parte Florida Mental 
Health Institute,

Headline: Men's basketball bids farewell to Bamba, Slatchev
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As another year comes to an end, it's time to say goodbye to senior athletes. 

For the men's basketball team, it's the time to bid farewell to center Belco Bamba and sharpshooter Slavcho Slavtchev.

Bamba came to FIU as a junior transfer from Cincinnati State where he played two seasons. 

As a Golden Panther, Bamba started 18 games as a junior and finished second in field goal percentage, making 27 of 54 shots. 

Despite having injuries early during junior year, Bamba faced no trouble senior year where he played in 26 games and started in two. 

This season, the native of West Africa pulled down 94 rebounds while averaging 3.6 points per game. 

The senior also led the team in shooting percentage, and shot 46 percent from the field.

Bamba's best game came on February 12 against Florida Gulf Coast, where he scored 23 points to go along with nine rebounds.

Slatchev is one of the few Golden Panthers who played all four years under former head coach Donnie Marsh. 

Slatchev led FIU in three-point shooting both his freshman and sophomore year. 

As a freshman, he finished in the top three in three-pointers, hitting an astonishing 42 of 89 shots. During his junior year, the guard shot 90 times, 74 of which where from beyond the arc.

Shooting three pointers was Slatchev's specialty,  as  he twice hit five of them in a game. 

His best scoring effort came back in 2000 where the native of Bulgaria had 19 points against Palm Beach Atlantic. 

During his senior season, Slatchev's best game came in a 14-minute effort against Sun Belt Conference rival Western Kentucky where he hit a pair of three pointers and finished the game with six points.

Headline: Happy Homecoming
Subheadline: Senior P.J. Lehmann was a new face, as well as a leader on the Golden Panther baseball team this season. It was his first year at FIU; it was also his last.
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After starting the season on the bench after transferring from The University of Central Florida, Lehmann has helped the Golden Panther baseball team climb to a 21-20 record after earning the starting job at third base.

Not only does he lead FIU with 17 multiple-hit games, but he also leads the team with a .381 batting average and a .453 on-base percentage. Lehmann also has three homeruns and is tied for second on the team with 26 RBIs. And even though he is a senior, he is doing all of this despite being a newcomer to FIU.

"I definitely think being it was my fourth year playing college baseball and the fact that I felt more comfortable has played a big role," Lehmann said. "It was a journey. I really wanted to go to a Division 1 school, but I ended up at Polk County Community College in Winter Haven out of high school."

After graduating from Miami Palmetto High in 2000, P.J. - or Peter Joseph Junior - was eager to live his college life on his own and quickly ventured to Polk County, Fla.  

"I really loved it there," said P.J. "It was a culture shock for me though."

A two-time letter winner and a second team All-Conference sophomore at Polk County, Lehmann batted .330, including a 21-game hitting streak during his first two years there. Despite being a shining star on his team, P.J. was once again yearning for another change. He headed off to the UCF in Orlando for a chance to start at second base on an academic scholarship.  

"I liked my teammates, but baseball there wasn't what I expected it to be," Lehmann said.

Lehmann struggled in his third year of college ball, hitting only .256 in 47 games and once again ready to make a move. But this time he was content with the thought of going home.  

"Coming out of high school, I wanted to get out on my own, but I was real excited to have the opportunity to come here to FIU."  

After P.J.'s father, Peter, helped P.J. get in contact with FIU baseball's Danny Price, P.J. was on his way home to Miami for a spot in the infield.  

"I knew I was gonna have a good chance playing here," Lehmann said.

However, Lehmann had to battle senior Jimmy Bacon at third base, and Bacon was awarded the starting job in the season opener. Lehmann began the first four games as a reserve. 

Despite P.J.'s brief setback, he knew he would be ready the minute he was thrown into the starting lineup. 

"I knew it was going to be tougher for me because I was a senior," Lehmann said. "But ever since I got in the lineup, I haven't come out."

Lehmann credits his biggest inspiration as his father. Peter Joseph Senior was FIU's men's and women's tennis coach from 1987-1999, and was very eager to be involved in his son's baseball career.  

"When my dad was a coach for tennis, I went to a lot of the baseball games," Lehmann said. "He was a big influence growing up and it helped out that he was a coach."

The business management major doesn't only have high hopes on the field, but he is also very ambitious for the future. 

"If I got the opportunity to play in the major leagues, I would, but I know it's not the end of the world if I don't.  

With 17 games left, P.J. holds his team high on a pedestal. 

"I really believe we have a good chance to win conference," he said. "Early on it seemed the ball wasn't bouncing our way, but we lacked confidence in the beginning ... But great teammates are hard to come by. Everyone is great here."  

Despite P.J. being a senior this year, he will be walking the stage for graduation in spring of 2005, after he finishes a few more classes. As he walks the stage, he will be able to look back on all his experiences through college and feel confident with the many life lessons he has learned.  

He will even be thinking of the three days a week his father made him have batting practice when he was only 8 years old.  

"I have had great friendships with all my teammates," Lehmann said. "Playing baseball in college has been a great experience and I wouldn't trade it for anything." 

WRAPPING UP THE SEASON

FIU will be finishing up April with a three-game series vs. New Mexico State in La Cruces, NM, April 30, and May 1-2.

The Golden Panthers will then travel to Mobile, AL, May 7-9 to face South Alabama.

The team will host three matches vs. New Orleans at FIU Community Stadium starting Fri., May 14 (7:00 PM.) They will play again Saturday, May 15 (1:00 PM) and Sunday (12:00 PM.) These will be the final regular season games at home for The Golden Panthers.

FIU will wrap up their 2004 campaign in Jonesboro, AR vs. Arkansas State May 21-23.

&nbsp;
Censorship: the institution, system or practice of examining in order to suppress or delete anything considered objectionable; in essence, altering (changing or removing portions) of literary, media or spoken content as seen fit by a pre-determined body. 

We all know the reasons why there is such controversy surrounding the topic. Anyone would disagree with a third party (the censors) making unwelcome changes to his or her original messages, regardless of the intent. 

But why don't we get down to the real issue. 

In my opinion the real issue is that historically, censorship has been on the agenda of a notoriously religious group of people. Everyone knows what happens when religion gets involved with anything, people begin to get really uncomfortable, defensive, militant even.  

When we talk about censorship are we really angry that our first amendment rights are being tampered with, or is it deeper than that? 

Perhaps we're unhappy with who's doing the tampering. 

Some religious fanatics maybe? 

Could it be those Christians again, sticking their noses in everything? 

Trying to convert us all? (Please note my sarcasm.)

The truth is that our society could use a little cleaning up, starting with our media. Sometimes I wonder why we've gotten so comfortable with things that are so obviously inappropriate. 

We are so accepting of immorality and indecency. 

Yet we wonder why we produce children who develop into adults with warped senses of self-respect and responsibility, and insatiable appetites for everything crude. I suppose you're thinking, "Don't tell me she's going to blame all the ills of our society on the need for censorship!" 

No, I'm not going to do that. What I am going to say is that the extremes that we continue to allow in our media, our literature, our music, and the like do not merely entertain.  

It's a basic law of science: Every action has a reaction. 

We have all kinds of examples staring us in the face. Did Ms. Jackson just up and decide one day that the best addition to her career portfolio was a booby-call, facilitated by none other than Justin Timberlake? 

Far from it. 

Halftime shows, after many years of pushing the limits are expected to be titillating. For that matter, the performers most likely to deliver the sex 'n' skin are the ones that are asked to perform. Coincidence? 

Hardly. 

How far has Howard Stern gone, yet only this past February did Clear Channel Communications see it fit to suspend him indefinitely. 

The general consensus is that what goes on via TV and radio after hours is suitable for adults, and no one should tell adults what to do. 

The reality is that there are very few programs, events, etc., which do not dish some content, at random times of the day, which most parents would prefer their children not be exposed to. 

Furthermore, this didn't become this way over night; it's the result  of letting a little bit go. Then a letting little more slip, and so on.

The issue goes far beyond mere censorship. It's about people's mindset. 

We live in a society that teaches us that we all have the right to do what we want, say what we want, live any way we want, and the consequences when potentially negative, should be masked by our constitutional rights. 

Contrary to popular belief, freedom of expression is not without responsibility for what is expressed. 

We must keep in mind that the freedom to not be bombarded by objectionable occurrences or material is as valid as the freedom of speech we hold so dear. We tend to appreciate one freedom and deny the other.

It's actually a pity that censorship has become a necessity. Expressing our freedoms as Americans, but more importantly as human beings should be a privilege, not an excuse to satisfy our lusts.

Headline: Graduates face uncertain prospects
Author: Andy Diaz/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's hard to sit by the Green library on an unusually cool and breezy April afternoon in Miami and not write a column about graduation that doesn't resort to the bittersweet clichés. 

How does one reflect on five years at FIU and avoid thinking about the friends we'll never talk to again, those who have moved away, those we simply lost contact with, the professors who retired, even the physical changes in the university? 

All of these things are tied inextricably to experience, and every event we recall engenders an emotional connection which we can't, for whatever reason, reenact in the present. This is the stuff life is made on.

But let's try to keep those clichés to a minimum.

The liturgical representation of graduation - the commencement ceremony - is so grossly misnamed that it hardly describes its ceremonial meaning and just misses the point of the whole shebang-a-bang. 

Denoting it simply as a "commencement" infers the incorrect notion that college is a means to an end and hence has little inherent value. It is especially nonsensical for people like me who plan to go on to graduate school and still have several "commencements" ahead of them.

I'll be one of the people graduating this semester, and one of those taking that walk of "commencement" towards a rolled up ersatz diploma and a handshake with President Maidique. 

It will be by all means a happy occasion and I'm very much looking forward to it, but we shouldn't ignore the fact that it will be as much an ending as it is a commencement. 

The commencement part of graduation alone leaves plenty to be concerned about. While finishing college is a great personal triumph for every student, and one that should be embraced universally, there are plenty of outside factors which mar the occasion somewhat and require urgent attention. 

Graduating students will face, to put it delicately, an uncertain job market. 

According to the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the month of March, 2004, our staggering economy created 308,000 jobs (a figure carelessly celebrated by the Bush administration,) but even with this surge in job creation, the amount of Americans unemployed remains at 8.4 million or 5.7 percent because of the increase in people entering the work force - that means us.

One of the main reasons, and the most commonly cited, for the current job scarcity is the bundled relatively modern phenomena of globalization, free trade, and outsourcing. Americans are losing jobs daily in the manufacturing and technology fields to overseas enterprises because of cheaper labor. As tragic as CNN's Lou Dobbs thinks this problem to be, that is hardly the case.

We have a moral responsibility to open up our markets and share our wealth with the world. This has been at the core of the liberal philosophy since the second half of the 19th century, which is why it is beyond me how some center-left politicians and pundits can oppose it. 

If you think globalization is yet another elaborate plot by the West to exploit the riches of the Third World, you might want to ask the Indians, the South Koreans (60 percent of whom have access to broadband internet connections), the Taiwanese, or the Chileans about the evils of free trade. 

The United States must remain committed to this economic model if we want to continue to claim the title of global liberal leader that we boast.

All of us graduating this semester share a small part in the responsibility to continue these ideals. We have taken the first step. That is, furthering our education so that we may lead by merit and not protectionist economic policies, and so that the education and abilities of our population equal our economic and military power. 

But like I said, this is merely one commencement out of many.

Headline: FIU artists prepare work for approaching student art show
Author: Adriana Deben / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's that time again. The 2004 Annual Student Art Show is coming to FIU's Frost Art Museum May 21 - June 6. The opening reception and award show will take place May 21 from 8 to 10 p.m. Judging will be hosted by internationally renowned artist and experienced curator, Robert Chambers.

To have the artwork entered, an FIU student must have completed it during the 2004 spring semester. There is a maximum of two pieces per artist allowed and all artists must attend the opening reception.

"The art show is an opportunity for the student body at large to show their work in the museum but also for the museum to acknowledge the student bodies' talents," said  Elizabeth Renfrow, Frost Art Museum curator.

Last year, there was an average of 85 entries. Subject matter encompassed everything from mixed media works to painting, sculpture, installation art, and even technologically based artwork that involved projected images.

Carol Damian, chairperson and professor of the art history department, said this is one of the most interesting and best shows yet. 

"The entire class is stellar. Watch MSG - the video group. They are really cutting-edge in their technology and group dynamic. I predict we will see them around the art community for years to come," Damian said.

Senior Giacomo Risso believes the show is an excellent opportunity for students who aren't necessarily art majors to show off their creative side.

"It's great to know that an accounting major can enter their art work and probably for once in their life exhibit their talents to the entire student body," Risso said.

Junior Robin Pitcher said, "I've heard a lot of buzz around campus that the art work will be wonderful.  Plus it's a great chance to meet other students and faculty that I wouldn't normally have the opportunity to meet."

Faculty and staff are hopeful of this year's artists. "Undoubtedly, the range of works in the exhibit prove the strength of the program and interest in exploring a variety of media," Damian said.

Furthermore, "it's a wonderful opportunity for the student body to become familiar with the museum," Renfrow said. 

To enter, just log on to the museum's website, www.frostartmuseum.org and download the entry form. The last date to enter and deliver your hopeful artwork to the museum is May 11. 

Results will be posted on the website as early as May 13.

Headline: Residents part after three years, memories remain
Author: Jon Banke / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There is a photograph on my apartment wall hanging above my computer desk. A frozen moment in time, it's bound only to the paper upon which it was printed. It's of my roommates and I at a party last February. Somehow, someone got all of us to quit our mingling, dancing, and partying to stop for three seconds of our lives and shout "Cheese!" Over the past three years at FIU moments like these have completely changed nearly everything about me.  

It began in the fall of 2001 during a typical hot and rainy month of August in South Florida. Arriving on campus, we were all strangers without the slightest idea as to what kind of people we would be living with and we had no idea what was in store for us over the upcoming school year. 

It was apparent early on that it was going to be great. Our first night together, before classes even began, we hung out in our very own apartment; it was our first time away getting to know each other as new roommates. Our personalities and lifestyles clashed a little, but our mutual sense of adventure and fun seemed to bring us all together.

Our freshman year, living in the University Park Apartments, was nothing short of the best year of our lives. Every night we were out and about around campus, creating new memories and stories to tell down the road during our collegiate careers, many of which are still told today. At times, it seemed like we were just trying to stay one step ahead of trouble, but these were the times that created the long lasting memories we all now share. There were so many parties, nights out, group activities, and just plain "hanging out" around the apartment that would become more of a home to us than any other before college. We always felt that someone could easily have written one of the most funny and entertaining books on the slapstick antics of our freshman year. 

Things were so good that we decided to stay together in the same building in an attempt to recreate the experiences of our first year. The eight of us, combined from two apartments on campus, once again lived out a fairy tale year building on everything we had from the year prior. 

"After the first year, there was no way I thought we could even come close to duplicating all of the fun we had, but somehow it was even better," said fellow resident Tim Coker. 

Again, the parties continued, and the good times rolled on. Before we could blink we were halfway through our entire college career.

Last fall, when our third year began, we knew that this year had to be our finest yet. We all knew this would be our final run together because two of our roommates, Diaz and Geisler, would be graduating and going on with their lives as graduates do. This would be the end of our "brotherhood," our last hurrah before going our separate ways. Never missing any opportunity for a good time, we made sure that we would not have a single regret during our last year together. 

"Moving on, I can say with all sincerity that this past school year, my last at FIU, has been hands down the best year of my life," said Diaz who graduates April 26. "We made sure that we never missed out on any chance to be together, hang out, or party. This was one incredible year." 

The memories we made over the past eight months on campus this school year will truly missed. Sure, the diploma with our name on it and the various things on our resumes are nice but the jokes, the fun, and all the good times we had together are what we will all cherish forever.

As our time together comes to a close, it feels to all of us that we are ending the best era of our lives. 

"Of course, I expected to make friends when I came here, but the last thing I expected was to find was a group of lifelong friends I will stay in contact with for years to come," said Geisler who is also graduating this year. 

We all knew this time would come, but as the concept of goodbye slowly begins to sink in, it becomes more and more difficult to grasp. 

"Having seen these guys from the outside for a few years as their RA three years ago, it always seemed like people envied the true friendships they built up together. Personally, I wished that I could be a part of something so great," said Eddie Alvarez, our former resident assistant. He remains to this day one of our closest friends, meeting him on that hot summer day when we moved onto campus in the summer of 2001. 

With all of us realizing the end was near, we have begun to go our separate ways in the past month or so. Some of the guys have landed jobs, promotions and others have found serious relationships with their girlfriends. In general, we seem to be spending more private time with ourselves and less as a group.

The time has come to close the longest, most amazing chapter of our lives, leaving us all gloomy. The feelings of nostalgia have already began to set in as I flip through the database of pictures built from the past three years. 

Memories linger like ghosts in the stale air of our box-ridden apartment. The white, barren walls will house a new group of residents next fall. None of us will ever forget the incredible times we spent here on campus and as we prepare to lock up and turn in our room keys, the biggest question we have in mind is what can possibly be in store for us next?

Lisa, 

 I wanted to know if the Beacon would be able to do a story on the honor society I represent, Beta Alpha Psi. We are a chapter of the most prestigous honor society dedicated solely to the accounting profession.   We have received numerous awards, including most outstanding honor society at FIU, and a superior chapter rating which ranks ahead of many top universities in the country who have a chapter of our honor society; which most of them do. In addition, we perform services for the student body such as tax preparation for both residents and non-residents at no cost, and tutoring services in accounting also at no cost. All of which we would like to inform the student body about so that we can help even more students in the future. Please email me, or you can reach me at 305-213-0003. 

Michael B.
