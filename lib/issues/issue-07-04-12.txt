Headline: BBC fitness center to offer new, improved facilities
Author: Ever Cruz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Junior Nick Arrieta was excited to hear about the construction of a brand new fitness center at the Biscayne Bay Campus. He felt the current fitness center he utilizes, located on the third floor of the Wolfe University Center, needed to expand and offer more services.

"This gym is ridiculous. It's outdated and the equipment needs to be updated," Arrieta said.

The $1.8 million project that will become the new fitness center and cafeteria will be located on the south end of WUC in the hallway that connects to Academic I. Stobs Brothers is the construction company in charge of the fitness center and cafeteria, which will house both projects in one space.

 According to Carlos G. Aspillaga, the senior project manager, the space set to house the new cafeteria and fitness center will be approximately 20,000 sq. ft. long. Each project will occupy exactly half of that space. Aspillaga also said about 65 pieces of equipment have been ordered for the new fitness center, but it's not a concrete number yet. The project will also tie in the pool to the new fitness center through a connecting corridor.

"The new facility will multiply the availability of options to the students," Aspillaga said.

Sophomore Zacchur Porter, a student majoring in sports management who also frequents BBC's current fitness center, likes the new center's accessibility.

"It's innovative. I'm excited because it's going to have a cafeteria because the first thing I want to do after working out is eat," Porter said.

Gregory Olson, senior director of Student Affairs at BBC, said both the fitness center and the cafeteria will be up and running by Fall 2007. 

He also said student tuition would not be affected by this new addition to BBC, since the funding for both projects came from a Capital Improvement Trust Fund given to the University by the state of Florida.

According to Olson, the current fitness center had formerly been an old recreation lounge. The new fitness center would give students the "opportunity to have a stand-alone fitness center." Olson said he and James R. Wassenaar, executive director of Student Affairs Operations and Auxiliary Services, had been planning the creation of a new fitness center for many years.

"There was a great need for this. Students had requested this for years and it's long over due; I know the students will really enjoy it," Olson said.

Although Wassenaar said the new fitness center's main goal is not to increase enrollment, but rather, to enhance BBC's existing services, he said the center will help attract new students to BBC.

According to junior Paul Richardson, the current BBC gym was not as adequate as the fitness center at University Park. UP's two-story fitness center houses work-out equipment on both floors that range from squat exercises to step machines. The UP fitness center also houses aerobic rooms where abdominal exercises and spinning classes are instructed. In comparison, BBC's current fitness center might be the size of two small classrooms and only has four cardiovascular machines available and about 30 pieces of weightlifting equipment.

"[The BBC] gym needs a lot of improvement, it needs new equipment and variety similar to [UP]," Richardson said.

Freshman Farrah Denis, said the current fitness center does not cater to the needs of its female patrons.

"I don't like this current gym. It's guy-oriented because there's only weight lifting machines. I want more cardiovascular machines. This gym does need more treadmills," Denis said.

According to Aspillaga, students who want more cardio options will be able to go to the new fitness center and use their aerobics room where there will be instructors conducting classes. 

He said the room will have a wall-size window overlooking the Biscayne Bay in order for students to enjoy the view and the boats passing by.

For students like senior Faizul Hussain, the new fitness center might have some disadvantages due to its size and space for more students to work out.

"I am satisfied with this current [fitness center]. The advantage of this one is that it's small. This [fitness center] is quiet and there are always [few] people in here and there are no distractions from fine girls. You could actually get some work done here, not like [at UP]. There is a lot of distraction over there," Hussain said. "But there is no water fountain in here, you have to go outside to drink water and swipe back in everytime."

Hussain accepts the opening of the new fitness center. He does, however, ask the new fitness center feature one thing.

"Make sure they have water fountains inside," he said.

Headline: New Waves: Music fest brings global beats to campus
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In Miami you're likely to hear the sounds of salsa, hip-hop and rap when you turn on a radio or when walking down the beach. To bring a different kind of music to South Florida, FIU's School of Music is hosting the 2007 New Music Miami International Society of Contemporary Music Festival.

FIU is one of two chapters of the ISCM in the U.S., according to festival director Orlando Garcia. The ISCM holds a special week of music every year as part of their World Music Days events. FIU's chapter submits compositions from various ISCM events that take place throughout the year in hopes they can be performed at the festival.

New Music promises to bring some of the most innovative composers and musicians from around the world to FIU.

"Music is my life," said clarinetist Evan Ziporyn. "I started clarinet when I was in third grade and have been into music for around 30 years."

Ziporyn kicked off the festival April 10 with a special lecture about his musical experiences playing as part of a gamelan, an Indonesian musical ensemble. Students present at the lecture were impressed with the wealth of experience that he brought.

"His perspective only comes with years of experience," said senior Ansen Steiner, a former student of the Berkley School of Music in Boston.

Other students present who were not as musically knowledgeable as Steiner also took something away from Ziporyn's lecture. 

"Most of it went over my head," said senior Emily Hutchinson. "But it was extremely interesting."

Ziporyn performed during festival's first concert at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center alongside Garcia, trombonist Mark Hetzler and the FIU Wind Ensemble.

Some musicians are more compatible than others; Ziporyn views Garcia as a musical complement.

"It's like a yin and yang," Ziporyn said. 

The next event of the festival will take place April 12 at 7:30 p.m. at Miami Art Central, an extension of the Miami Art Museum. 

A concert will follow a pre-concert panel of international musicians, including Alejandro Escuer from Mexico and James Fulkerson from Holland. Members of the Barton Workshop will also perform.

Escuer received a Grammy nomination in 2004 for his work on the album Planos. Fulkerson has composed over 200 works and the Barton Workshop boasts a rigorous rehearsal schedule, which allows the group to innovate electronic music methods. 

For graduate student David Mendoza the festival has been a once in a lifetime opportunity. 

"I've helped organize the festival by transporting the various composers and performers to the different venues," Mendoza said. "But getting to really know them has been an experience."

Mendoza also commented that the master classes - special classes where known composers or performers critique works written by students - has made his experience invaluable. 

"When you take music classes you learn from one or two professors you can't relate to," Mendoza said. "Some of these performers and composers are in their 20s or 30s, which helps."

There will be a public flute master class featuring Escuer in WPAC 157 at 11 a.m. Escuer will also discuss music by Mexican composers.

"[New Music] will give students and South Florida the chance to hear this classical music," Garcia said. "It's important."

For a complete list and schedule of events see www.fiu.edu/~music. All events are free an open to the public.

Headline: Review: Proof (Theatre)
Subheadline: Play explores complex relationships
Author: Angelina Esposito / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In Proof, the School of Theatre chose a play that forces audiences to think beyond just personal insight or a twisting plot - a little algebra is needed, too. Compared to Silence, its predecessor in rotating repertory, Proof's topics are somewhat lighter but just as dramatic and insightful

Directed by Judy Bauerlein, Proof revolves around high order mathematics, the emotional undertones of turning into our parents, personal discovery and a little bit of romance.

The story revolves around Catherine, the daughter of a mathematical genius named Robert, who deals with the discovery of a groundbreaking mathematical proof and an overbearing sister, Claire, who fears Catherine has a touch of Robert's mental illness. Added into the mix is Hal, Robert's former student, who brings a little needed love to Catherine's life.

Proof made its way into movie theaters recently with a cast of big name actors including Anthony Hopkins, Gwenyth Paltrow, Jake Gyllenhaal and Hope Davis. Such a notable cast could make it difficult for young actors to even fathom trying to provide an adequate or better performance.

So fearful of seeing a reenactment of the actors who portrayed the characters on the big screen, I was generally taken aback by the students' performances. While each individual held their own in the portrayal of their characters, the sisters in the play really stood out. 

The relationship of the two sisters was more dynamic than in the movie and I really enjoyed the way Natalie Ceballos, the actress who played Claire, interpreted her role. Claire wasn't just a snobby New Yorker - Ceballos gave the character some flare and a touch of comedy. Due to the nature of Catherine's character, Ceballos's wit helped amplify the differences between the two.

As for the portrayal of Catherine, it was actually entertaining (sorry, Paltrow, but you seemed drugged out most of the time). Corinne Farkash, who plays Catherine, gave her character some backbone but was still able to display the Catherine's weaknesses at the right times.

The set and costumes were well done. I was confused for a second as to why the house looked like it was an outline in chalk, but then I realized - Oh duh, a blackboard. As for the changing set due to the rotating repertory, it worked well. The key elements that each show used didn't distract or seem out of place.

From the styles of both Silence and Proof, these plays display huge differences, but are still fun to watch.

For show times or ticket information, contact the box office at 305-348-3789. Student tickets cost $8 and general admission is $10.

Headline: Good credit history key to employment
Author: Maria Concha / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With graduation just a few weeks away, students are hoping to land the job they've been training for throughout their college career. 

But, if they didn't keep up a good credit score, they may be in for a big surprise.

These days, employers are checking possible employees' credit history as part of the decision in the hiring process. 

So, whether or not one is hired may depend on a lot more than skills.

According to Richard Finney, training and diversity manager at General Motors Acceptance Corporation Financial Services, credit has more than one meaning: it allows you to buy now and pay later, and credit is a person's reputation for paying bills on time.

It's important for a student looking for a job to have good credit because for an employer having good credit is synonymous with being responsible.

"Positions are more like a business partnership than an employee/employer relationship," said Matthew R. Lohr, director of development at Northwestern Mutual Financial Network. "And in any business situation, you want to know your partner's financial history."

Even though a credit history check may be more common if a student is applying for placement at a financial institution, other jobs may also require a credit check.

According to John Zdanowicz, professor of finance at the FIU College of Business Administration, employers check a future employee's credit history to find out more about the character of that individual and determine if that person is responsible.

"Usually, when a person has bad credit, it shows that that person [makes] poor rational decisions," Zdanowicz said.

Jose Toscano, assistant director at Campus Life adds that a credit history check is done because "employers want to make sure that their employees are making sound decisions for their clients."

But is it legal for a future employer to check your credit history?

Yes, but only with the applicant's consent.

According to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an employer or prospective employer needs written consent to obtain a report.

For employers, checking your credit history is as easy as checking your driving record, your past employers, references and criminal history.

"Just as you are allowed to check your credit history, a company can ask for the record as well, if during the application process you allow them to," Lohr said.

Your credit report information is collected and can be obtained by contacting the nation's three major credit reporting agencies or bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.

Information such as the type of account you have and how often you pay is available through credit reporting agencies because creditors provide them with the needed data. 

The agencies then package and sell the information in the form of a credit report.

Among one of the biggest reasons students end up with bad credit is credit cards.

Although credit card companies target everyone, they tend to target college students the most, according to Lohr.

"[It's] because of the knowledge they lack when it comes to credit cards," Lohr said. "Most, not all, college students have a very limited knowledge about their personal finances and the actual potential problems faced with using a credit card."

Zdanowicz adds that college students have bad credit due to their spending habits and to the fact that they have no self-control.

"To have good credit, it must be built. It's not like grades where you start out with an 'A,' you have to develop your credit rating with payments like credit cards, car payments and home loans," Lohr said. "A young person's first introduction into this is the credit card, one of the hardest to manage and easiest to abuse."

Unfortunately, there is no quick fix to bad credit, but experts suggest students can start by paying their bills on time - even if it's just the minimum payment.

"Always pay your monthly bill, even if you are paying the minimum for the month," Lohr said. "Also, don't use a credit card for excessive purchases that you could not afford otherwise."

Toscano suggests getting a finance expert involved.

"If students feel that they might go overboard with credit cards, for example, have a financial planner help out," Toscano said.

Others have a more radical approach.

"Cut the credit card up and throw it away," Zdanowicz said. "If you don't have money, then do not buy it."

But students who have bad credit and are currently looking for a job might still land it if they're prepared.

Lohr suggests that students know their financial situation and if it comes up during an interview process it is better to acknowledge it and provide a solution that you are working to correct the problem.

And besides finding a job, students are plagued with other troubles for having a poor credit score, such as finding a place to live, negotiating finance rates, renting a car, making hotel reservations and obtaining credit cards.

"Students need to take their credit history very seriously and need to have self-control," Zdanowicz said.

Headline: College of Engineering builds "green" house in China
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After an invitation from the Chinese Ministry of Construction, faculty from the College of Engineering and Computing were asked to design and build an environment-friendly house in Beijing, China, which will be located near the site of the 2008 Olympic Games.

Called the Future House Community, the plans arose out of China's growing energy and environmental concerns. 

The overall goal of the project, directed by the CMC, is to design and build energy and environment friendly houses. In total 10 houses will be built by eight different countries. 

Besides China, the other countries participating in the project are Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United States.

FIU will be the only university participating from the United States.

"It is a distinct honor to be selected by the Chinese government as the only university from the US to participate in the project," said Yong Tao, professor of mechanical and materials engineering and director of the project.

FIU gained international recognition after the engineering department's success at the 2005 National Solar Decathlon in Washington, D.C., where FIU won in the energy balance category.

The competition required student teams to design, build and operate a solar-powered house. 

Construction Management, the School of Architecture, and Mechanical Engineering were the departments most responsible for the designing of FIU's Future House, Tao said.

It is estimated that the project will cost at least half a million dollars, according to Vishwanath Prasad, executive dean of the College of Engineering and Computing.

To reach that amount, the school of engineering has partnered with the Alternative Energy Living Foundation in Moline, Ill.; the National Defense Council Foundation in Washington, D.C.; the American Council on Renewable Energy; the Consumer Energy Alliance and the Environmental Study Institute.

"This kind of project can cost a lot of money," Prasad said. "All designs were approved by the faculty."

To further offset costs, most of the house will be built with prefabricated parts that will be shipped to the construction sight in Beijing rather than starting from scratch on site.

The house is based on the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, a famous architect from the late 1800s and early 1900s, Prasad said. 

Wright practiced organic architecture, a form that combines habitation with the environment around it.

FIU's future house also incorporates the Chinese philosophy of feng shui, literally translated as wind and water. 

This principal emphasizes the placement and arrangement of space to maintain harmony with nature.

The house will also reflect some of Florida's architectural style, according to Prasad.

It will include solar panels to offset energy needs and utilize low water consumption methods.

"We will be able to show our stuff," Prasad said. "We will also be able to learn from each other." 

Ground breaking for the project was held March 16 in Beijing and went well with over 100 in attendance, according to Tao. 

With the design aspect essentially finished, all that's left is for the house to be built. 

"There are always modifications made," Tao said. "But construction is all that's left."

Construction is expected to be complete by the start of the 2008 Olympic games.

 The house will be open to the public for touring until 2014, after which FIU will use it for workshops and training exercises, Prasad said.

Headline: Softball beats 14th ranked Ragin' Cajuns
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
At Lamson Park, Ragin' Cajun fans have a tradition of throwing back any home run hit by the opposing team. 

On April 7, Cajun fans were busying throwing back three balls - all courtesy of senior catch Tabitha Embry.

Her three home runs helped FIU (17-26, 5-7) defeat No. 14 University of Louisiana Lafayette 8-3 on the final game of the three-game series to give the women's softball team the sweep.

"To sweep them at their park … is a big deal," coach Kim Gwydir said. "This is not a little Miami thing, this is a nation-wide thing."

This was the first series sweep of the season for the Golden Panthers and also the first time the Ragin' Cajuns (34-11, 7-5) had been swept in their 11 years of conference play in the Sun Belt Conference. 

"We always struggle with ULL," Embry said. "We usually come up short against them, but luckily, in my senior year, we showed them who was boss." 



FIU 4, ULL 0



The Golden Panthers' pitching and defense was on point in the first game of a double header as junior pitcher Kerri Houck (7-13) limited the No. 4 ranked offense in the conference to four hits through seven innings of work.

"[A pitcher] definitely doesn't do it on their own," Gwydir said. "[Our team] has had a lot of adversity this year. It's nice to see some tangible results from all the hard work they've put in."

Up 1-0 in the fourth inning, sophomore Kim Rodriguez and junior Ashley Falk added three more runs after hitting back-to-back home runs off of Ragin' Cajuns pitcher Holly Tankersley (11-4).



FIU 2, ULL 0



It was a simple bunt by Ragin' Cajuns senior second baseman Tara Hamilton in the bottom of the fifth inning that kept Golden Panthers starting pitcher Penny Eastman (9-10) from recording a no-hitter.

Despite the bunt single, she struck out five batters in seven innings of work.

"On some days we hit well, but don't pitch well and on other days we pitch well but don't play good defense and vice versa," Gwydir said. "But they're starting to put it all together. This shows them that they can beat anyone."

Junior shortstop Monique White provided the Golden Panthers with all the offense they needed with a two-run home run in the fifth inning.



FIU 8, ULL 3



The final game of the series brought some dynamic weather elements as sleet came down during the game.

 In spite of the playing conditions, Embry smacked three home runs off of freshmen Brittany Cuevas and Shari Sigur.

"She hit about 900 feet in home runs that game alone," Gwydir said.

Embry's first home run in the fourth inning gave her team a 4-2 lead after it trailed in the previous innings.

Her second home run sailed straight over the bleachers behind the centerfield wall.

"It took them a couple of pitches to throw that one back," Gwydir said. 

"She was a one-man    wrecking crew."

Her final home run of the night doubled her season total from three to six on the year and 18 for her career. 

Her performance broke the individual home runs in a single game record, passing Shannon Carey and Jennifer Powell, and is also now tied for first place on the all-time list with Carey for career home runs.

"Each of the three home runs I hit were for my mother, father and sister who were at the game," Embry said.

Equally as impressive as Embry's power was Eastman's command on the mound as she relieved Houck, who was having difficulties controlling her pitches in the frigid conditions, during the second inning.

Unnerved by the weather conditions, the Colorado native relied heavily on her curveball and screwball to strikeout four Ragin' Cajun batters in four and two-third innings.

"It felt amazing to get the win. This was probably my best memory as a college player," Eastman said.

Headline: Accents can hinder learning
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's the first day of a math class and the professor walks in and writes his name on the board and passes out a syllabus. So far so good, until the professor decides to speak. It's not what the professor is saying that is the problem, it's the fact that no one can understand what the professor is saying. That is the issue. 

"We do have some problems," said Julian Edward, the chair of the mathematics department. "We try to hire the best adjunct professors possible."

When I talk about the professors being incoherent, I'm referring to their inability to speak English properly. Some of them have such thick accents, it makes it impossible to understand. It is a general standard here at FIU that it is required to take math to graduate; I would think that the math department would take greater care when hiring their adjunct professors.

According to Edward, student evaluations are taken seriously at the end of each semester, and if  an adjunct professor has a serious language problem they would be let go and not rehired. The problem with using the evaluations made by students at the end of a semester is that those who have had problems with understanding the professor have already dropped the class by then.

While that sounds all well and good, it would be much more preferable if the math department simply did not hire people who could not speak English properly in the first place.

I know this school is located in Miami and a large percentage of the population speaks Spanish or some other language, but frankly, this is still the United States and the language most people speak here is English. It does not matter if the U.S. government proclaims it the official language or not - when it comes to the way people live, English is the dominant language.

No matter how many languages are spoken here, Miami is still a city in the United States. It's not Cuba, Mexico or Korea. It's the United Sates, and we speak English, period.

In fact, out of the 209,279,149 people age 18 and over in the U.S., 82.24 percent of them speak only English, according to the 2000 Census. Of the 12,347,806 people age 18 and over in Florida, 77.03 percent speak only English as well.   

Unlike most other countries in the world, the U.S. makes a million and one concessions for people who speak a different language.

If you go to France you better speak French, because if you don't you won't be able to do much of anything; the same goes if you are in any other country for that matter. 

The U.S. makes too many concessions for those who speak a different language than English. Concessions they should not be making- such as the bilingual schools popping up all over the place. 

My nephew once lived across the street from a bilingual elementary school. He could not attend the school because he did not speak Spanish, which was the language half the classes were taught in. 

How is it fair that he could not go to a federally funded public school because he did not speak a foreign language? It is not fair.  

FIU is no different, as evidenced by the hiring of adjunct professors who can't speak English properly and in turn hurt the students' learning ability.

I don't mean to pick on the mathematics department, as they are not the only department on campus that has this problem. Math just happens to be the one department you're always hearing about in the hallways.

The bottom line is all of the FIU departments need to not just fix the language barrier problems that students face from professors, but stop the issue altogether by not hiring professors that cannot articulate English properly and coherently in the first place.

I don't have a problem with people who speak foreign languages. I have problems with professors who cannot properly communicate with students.

The selection of adjunct professors needs to be stricter in regards to applicant's ability to communicate in English, which is the predominant language in the country. The University should not be concerned with hurting professors' feelings. It should be concerned with the students who are forced to drop classes they paid good money to take because they could not understand what their professor was saying.

Headline: Editorial: Lack of variety in SGC-UP presidential ticket a problem
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It's another year, another election and there is another presidential candidate running unopposed for the Student Government Council at University Park. Two in a row is hardly a trend, but still, it prompts the question: Why are all but one of our student representatives so reluctant to run for president?

It can't be the requirements for the position, since they are few and pretty lax. The requirements are as follows: start with having held an elected position for at least two semesters. Then there's the minimum GPA requirement - which is easy enough - and a lack of academic and disciplinary sanctions, which, frankly, is what should be expected of all student government representatives. Take at least half your classes at the campus you're running to represent and - voila! - you are fit to run for president. 

So, what is it then? 

The answer is so obvious, it makes the question hardly worth asking. It's the apathy.

The lack of presidential wannabes the past two years isn't anything remarkable. It's just a symptom of student apathy

Most student organizations - The Beacon included - know what that's like.

They know how hard it is to find even a few good students to sign up and participate.

They also know that getting them there is one thing, but getting them to stick to their commitment is almost a ludicrous proposition.

Anyone who's screened a movie, sponsored a forum or organized a talk knows that, no matter the amount of advertising used, getting more than a handful of students to show up is usually a matter of pure, dumb luck. 

That said, having only one presidential candidate is unacceptable.  Are the pickings  that slim over at the University Park council? If so, couldn't they be making more of an effort to recruit a fresh crop of aspiring politicos?

The Beacon makes an effort each year to recruit fresh writers and staff from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication's crop of young journalism students. Heck, even among grizzled seniors, we usually manage to scrounge up a handful a semester. Given the shortage of political stock these past two years, SGA veterans should consider going out to political science lectures and do some  recruiting.

Here's a thought: past United States presidents, after leaving their posts, habitually use their residual political sheen and visibility to lobby for their pet causes. If current SGC-UP President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon wishes to remain involved with the organization, perhaps he could help lobby students from fields such as political sciences to get involved. SGA has also done little to emphasize the merits of working with student government: the networking, the chance to represent students, and of course, a resume boost.

The council needs fresh blood, and it needs it now. It sure beats getting stuck with a single-candidate presidential race yet another year.

Headline: Tekes win fraternity intramural soccer championship
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
A sea of red and purple divided the Recreational Field. 

The two rivaling factions rooted for the soccer teams of Tau Kappa Epsilon or Phi Gamma Delta and sported painted faces. Constant flag waving and emphatic screaming was directed at teammates to instill encouragement and at the opposition to instill fear.

For the second straight year, the FIJIs and Tekes faced off in the intramural championship game. 

However, the reigning champion, FIJI, would not be able to relive last year's success as the Tekes grabbed this year's championship in the final minutes of the game, winning 3-2.

FIJI won last year in a decisive shootout that left a bad taste in the mouths of Teke members.

"We were hoping it wouldn't come down to penalty kicks this year," said Teke member Lake Summers. "But we bombed those last two goals in there. We just beamed them in."

Scoring opportunities were abundant for both teams early on as both offenses took advantage of lackadaisical defense. 

The Tekes struck first with a short goal by Guilar Seagal. 

Seagal penetrated the FIJI defense and put himself within a few feet of the goal. He then shot on goal, only to have it blocked by FIJI goalie Kyle Bagley. The ball ricocheted off Bagley's hands and back to Seagal's feet when he shot it again for the first goal of the game.

FIJI would gradually weaken the Teke defense by advancing the ball into Teke territory applying constant pressure that exposed cracks in the Teke defense. 

One of the cracks exploited was by Andrew Scharhag, who blasted a goal from the outside to tie the game at 1-1.

The FIJI's success would be short-lived, as the Tekes would recapture the lead moments later with a powerful kick from Seagal once again.

The momentum had shifted in favor of the Tekes as they headed into intermission with a 2-1 lead.

"We help each other. Today it was me, but everyone steps it up any day," Guilar said.

Scoring opportunities were prominent during the first half, but they would be scarce in the second. 

There was a defensive battle between both teams as shots on goal for each team began to diminish. 

The once fluid game was now a rigid defensive battle that included various balls hit well out of play. 

Fatigue began to set in as the play from both teams diminished.

 Sloppy passes or balls that were over-kicked or not properly received by teammates became the norm.

Fans became restless and frustrated because of the teams' inability to produce an effective offense had slowed down the pace of the game.

FIJI eventually began to play a stronger offense. James Edward White controlled the ball from the right wing of the goal post. 

He kicked the ball from a difficult angle, but managed to sneak the ball away from Teke goalie Daniel Rendueles, tying the game at 2-2.

White's game-tying blast would change the pace of the game. 

The shots on goal increased rapidly, but so did the defensive effort from both goalies. 

The once conservative minded defense began taking risks by moving toward the ball rather than letting the offense kick it towards them. Diving saves and collisions between players became routine towards the last moments of the game.

The last time the two teams decided a game with a shootout, FIJI became the fraternity intramural soccer champions.

During the closing moments of the game, Carlos Amastha launched a power kick from the left side of the field. 

The ball tailed away from Bagley's diving hands and landed inside the goal. 

Amastha proceeded to do back flips with the Teke crowd providing him music to celebrate.

FIJI's final attempt to score one more goal was futile as they were unable to defend their championship. 

The Tekes had gained their revenge and became champions for the first time in four years.

"This is my year; I'm graduating. It's mine now and I wanted it," Rendueles said.

BASEBALL:
The baseball team (17-18) lost the final two games in a three-game series against Arkansas State University (14-20) April 6-7 at Tomlinson Stadium in Jonesboro, Ark.

In the first game, Chris Allen dominated the Indians as he struck out 11 batters throughout the course of his second complete game effort of the season. Allen gave up three earned runs to give the Golden Panthers a 5-3 win. Outfielder Raimy Fuentes finished with two RBI, including a solo home run and a triple. Sun Belt Conference batting average leader, outfielder James McOwen, hit in the lead-off spot and came around to score the game's first run after hitting a lead-off double.

In the first game of a doubleheader April 7, the Indians' lefty T. J. Brewer threw a complete game of his own and shut out the Golden Panthers in a 4-0 win. McOwen remained in the lead-off spot and recorded two hits, but the Golden Panthers began the game ominously as they loaded the bases without scoring a run. They stranded nine batters the whole game. 



FOOTBALL:
The offense made its first scores April 7 as quarterback Paul McCall threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to tight end Moses Hinton. McCall finished the day completing 10-of-18 passes for 112 yards. The defense was productive as it recorded nine sacks in 100 plays from scrimmage. The defense recorded no interceptions, but it did force several dropped passes.



TRACK AND FIELD:
Junior Paola Reategui set a new FIU record in the women's 3,000-meter steeplechase, finishing with a time of 11:14.68. Sophomore Eddie Arguello recorded the second best time in FIU history in the men's 3,000 steeplechase with a time of 9:34.64.



HOCKEY:
The roller hockey club was eliminated from the 2007 Collegiate Roller Hockey National Championships by Eastern Michigan University in a 8-3 loss.
