Headline: Russo's team sweeps Arkansas schools
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After a crushing loss to South Dakota State at home Jan. 28, the women's basketball team geared up for a crucial four-game road trip with all their games being against Sun Belt Conference foes.

The trip did not go as planned at the start, as they dropped their first two games versus East Division leaders Middle Tennessee and Western Kentucky.

After losing to Western Kentucky by the largest margin of the season (22 points), dropping three games in a row and giving up the East Division lead of the Sun Belt Conference, the lady ballers were determined to finish strong.

They bounced back and ended up 2-2 in their road trip, with key victories versus Arkansas Little-Rock and Arkansas State.

The back-to-back wins put FIU at 14-9 and 7-3 in conference games. They now stand in third place of the East Division of the Sun Belt Conference - one game behind Middle Tennessee and Western Kentucky.

They will come back home for a Feb. 16 meeting against South Alabama - the first meeting of the season between the two teams - with tip-off at 7 p.m.



FIU 60, UALR 55



The Trojans were fresh off snapping ASU's 13-game winning streak, but had no such luck snapping FIU's 13-game winning streak versus them Feb. 11.

FIU was just too good from the free-throw line.  They shot a season-high 91.7 percent from the stripe and held UALR to no field goals in the final nine minutes of the game to claim the five-point win.

UALR fell to 12-11 and 4-6 versus Sun-Belt Conference foes.  

Junior Lasma Jekabsone was up to her old tricks as she achieved her fifth straight double double with 21 points and 13 rebounds.  It was her 11 first half points that kept FIU in the game as they shot an abysmal 25 percent from the field.

The Golden Panthers went on an 8-2 run in the beginning of the second half to take a four-point lead. Back-to-back buckets by freshman Renee Renz - who finished with 12 points and 7 rebounds - tied the game at 51 with just 4:38 left.

But FIU was just too much to handle as they shot 9-10 from the free-throw line and limited UALR to just one field goal in the final minutes to get the win.  

LaQuetta Ferguson and Marquita Adley proved vital off the bench and combined for 19 points and 12 rebounds.  Jocelyn Love, UALR shooting guard, came off a 36-point performance in the win against Arkansas-State and finished the night with 25 points.



FIU 67 ASU 63



The Golden Panthers showed resiliency Feb. 13 in front of 2,119 people at the Convocation Center.  They erased a 20-point deficit in the second half, as they claimed the four-point victory.  

The come-from-behind win is the third largest in NCAA Women's Basketball history.

Shortly after being named in ESPN The Magazine's district III second team for excellence in the classroom and the basketball court, Jekabsone proved her worth by putting up her sixth straight double double with 18 points and 18 rebounds.  She also tied her career-high with seven blocks to move her into third place on the FIU all-time list with 143 blocks.

The first half was a forgettable one for FIU.  They committed 15 turnovers and shot 35 percent from the field and were down 44-26 at intermission.

But the Golden Panthers went on a 13 point run and with a lay-up by center Liene Bernsone, FIU took its first lead.  Then the three-pointer by Iva Ciglar put them up four with just three minutes remaining and they were able to hold on.

ASU completely fell apart in the second half.  They were outscored 41-19 and only made two field goals in the final nine minutes of the game.  

FIU shot a whopping 63 percent from the field in the second half and out rebounded ASU 44-32 for the game.

Ciglar scored 14 points and a game-high  three-pointer. Makela and Ferguson each put up 11 points and four assists, while Faeza Bouderra added eight points and six assists.

Headline: Softball loses three of four in tournament

&nbsp;
After dropping the first two games Feb. 10 to No. 19 Iowa and North Carolina, it was hard to gauge how the softball team would respond the next night in their double header against Arkansas and No. 10 Georgia.

The Golden Panthers opened up the evening by doing damage to Arkansas before losing the second game to Georgia. They followed up Feb. 12 with a loss to Georgia in the semifinals.

The Golden Panthers dropped their record to 1-4. However, head coach Kim Gwydir isn't concerned with her team's slow start. 

"I'm very happy with them, overall, as we're an extremely young team," Gwydir said. "This is the first time our team is playing together as we lost our Fall [semester] due to the hurricane."

The Golden Panthers will look to improve on their record when they participate in the Dunkin' Donuts Classic Feb. 17-19 in Boca Raton, Fla.



FIU 8, ARK 3



Despite a delay prior to game time, it quickly became a thrilling match up. Sophomore Kerri Houck was the starting pitcher for the Golden Panthers and Katy Henry was the starting pitcher for the Lady Razorbacks. 

Lady Razorbacks started things off in the bottom of the first inning with Shana Easley hitting an RBI sacrifice fly, making the score 1-0.

FIU quickly responded as Henry walked catcher Tabitha Embry to begin the second inning. Third baseman Samantha Card also was walked and the Golden Panthers posed a threat with runners on first and second and no outs. Freshman second baseman Katie Bell followed up with a single and Embry scored, tying the game at one. 

The score would remain tied until the top of the fourth inning, when first baseman Brooke Ruiz hit a double to start things off. Her double was replicated by Bell and Ruiz scored to make the game 2-1 with two outs. 

Shortstop Desiree Fink also got into the mix, hitting a single, which couldn't be caught by third baseman Carrie Egnor, making the score 3-1 in FIU's favor.

Arkansas would tie the game 3-3 in the fourth, but would leave the bases loaded to end the inning. 

The very next inning, Brittany Witherow hit an RBI single, which gave FIU a 4-3 lead they would not relinquish.

FIU pitcher Penny Eastman relived Houck at the bottom of the fifth inning and Arkansas had no answers for the freshman as she struck out four batters and allowed no runs in her two and two-thirds innings of work.



Not only was the pitching near perfection after the fourth inning but the offense suddenly caught on fire, particularly in the seventh inning, when the Golden Panthers scored four runs to make the score 8-3. The seventh inning assault began with Senior Jennifer Powell, who had been 0-3 prior to that at bat, hitting a double to start the offensive on slot. Later on at the top of the inning, the bases were loaded and FIU took advantage, scoring four crucial runs to ice the game.

Katie Bell was the star offensively for the Golden Panthers as she went 3-4 with three RBI's. Gwydir was very impressed with her second baseman, calling her play "outstanding" during the game and throughout the weekend tournament.

Gwydir had positive things to say about her ball club. 

"I think we were pressing a little bit to begin the game. We were trying to do a little too much," Gwydir said. 

Gwydir felt her star senior Jennifer Powell was pressing also, due to her increased leadership role on the team. 

"I had to tell her to relax, let the game to you. Once she and the other players did that, we were alright," Gwydir said.

With the win, Houck improved her record to 1-1 and Eastman was credited with her first save. 



FIU 2, UGA 6



Playing off the momentum from the Arkansas victory, FIU went into the second game of the double header with hopes of sweeping the day with two victories. Georgia wasn't about to let that happen and they showed why they are No. 10 in the country. 

The first inning proved to be very painful for first baseman Brooke Ruiz who was hit by the ball in the mouth as she was attempting to catch it with her glove. Her return to the game was a positive sign, but the rest of the game had to be much more painful for the rest of her teammates.

Despite pitching all seven innings and striking out eight, Redshirt Freshman Sarah Belanger and the Golden Panthers couldn't overcome a four-run sixth inning by the Bulldogs who were lead by third baseman Alison Horne, who went 2-3 with three RBI's and a run scored.

FIU attempted to gain momentum in the bottom of the sixth inning when outfielder Deomni Murray hit a single, which was followed by Powell hitting a single, leading Murray to score after she had stolen two bases. This made the score 5-1 after six innings but Georgia quickly scored another run at the top of the seventh inning to make it 6-1 and subsequently putting the game out of reach.

Belanger's record fell to 0-1.

 "Our pitching tired out, but our defense has to help our pitchers," Gywdir said.

&nbsp;
In what turned into a lack luster performance on Valentine's Day, FIU took care of business when it counted and scraped out a deserved win. 

The Golden Panthers (7-16), who came off an 85-84 overtime loss at the hands of conference foe Arkansas State Feb. 11, were not even the most exciting part of afternoon as they beat out-of-conference rival North Florida (6-19) 71-57 in front of a minuscule Valentine's Day matinee crowd. 

Just over 500 people witnessed three fans try their best to collect $1000 cash  in a fan giveaway at halftime as well as the Golden Panthers ending their seven-game losing streak against their final non-conference opponent.

The Osprey loss marked their 17th straight road loss.

 "We have won four out of the last seven," said head coach Sergio Rouco. "We have lost three games that were possession games. We could have been seven and seven, but the kids know that; they are hungry enough. We made a stretch run last year and we will [again], God-willing, we stay healthy and we will again as we continue to get better."

Ivan Almonte led the way for the homeside, finishing the afternoon with 17 points and nine rebounds as his newborn son watched for the first time from the sidelines. 

Streaky shooting from long range threat Johwen Villegas proved the difference as the first-year man connected on five of eight tries from behind the arc, four of which came in the first half, and finished with 15 points. 

Sophomore Kenny Simms joined the two in double figures; having a dominant day inside the paint and contributing 15 points and eight rebounds.

North Florida was led by Rashad Williams and Chris Timberlake, who combined for 30 points, 20 and 10, respectively. 

Alain Laroche had been the hottest Osprey, having notched 20 or more points in seven of his last 11 games, but was held to just nine points and nine rebounds by FIU's tough defensive presence. 

Despite a 12-0 run with under 10 minutes to play by UNF that brought the game within five with 7:36 to play, the Golden Panthers showed maturity as they managed to pull a 19-9 run to end the game. 

"I didn't want to react," Rouco said. "I told them I wasn't going to call a timeout and I told them they need to sort it out because I didn't want to bring them back and yell at them. We have done that but they have to sort it out [and] talk to each other, and they did."

Rouco's men got off to a solid start, scoring the first six points of the match-up and then pulling off an 11-2 run with under 10 minutes to play in the first half that built a 12 point lead. Following a late rally by the Osprey, the Golden Panthers went into the locker room up eight, 36-28.   

"I thought we started with a great flow," Rouco said. "Then anytime somebody changes it up a little bit on us, we start tightening up. We have to learn to play through adjustments. It's great when it's going great but then when they make an adjustment [things change]."

The Golden Panthers continue home play Feb. 18 as they host Troy before a  match-up, Feb. 20, against West division leaders South Alabama.

Subheadline: Safety and ignorance share no place in gay community
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Being gay and living in Miami is kind of great; at least the chances of being gunned down at a gay bar here are slim to none ... unless it's by the jealous tranny who's upset you danced with her man.

For those who aren't caught up with recent news, last weekend, in the ever popular city of New Bedford, Mass., a crazy Neo-Nazi entered a bar, asked if it was a gay one and thought it to be a good idea to take out a hatchet and gun and cause some destruction. 

Three bar patrons were hurt, two suffering gunshots in the back and chest.

The suspect, later identified as Jacob D. Robida, 18, escaped and traveled all the way to Arkansas, where he was killed by police after he supposedly shot a cop on a routine traffic stop.

This leads me to the point of this column ... can we expect incidents similar to this one ever to happen in Miami?

My prediction: not to the same extent.

I'm not saying that a crazy person can't walk into Ozone next weekend and shoot the place up because we have 'gay cooties,' but hopefully, most Miamians have been educated enough to know the difference between right and wrong and in this case, sane and psychotic.

It will take much longer strides for homosexuality to be completely accepted across the nation, but if any local doesn't know by now that Miami isn't a gay condemning community, then they've been living under a rock.

However, this doesn't mean that we, should take for granted this immunity. 

I don't think we should live our lives constantly thinking about what's happening to other gays outside our unscathed realm, but we do have to be conscious of what is going on both nationally and globally to those like us if we ever want to be fully accepted for who we are. 

We cannot just pretend that as long as we're able to walk around Miami holding hands with our significant other without an excess of points and hollers, that those who share our same emotions and feelings,  nation or even world-wide have the same freedom we do.

Even though Miami is one of the safest places for gays in the United States and, so far,  hate crimes are not as violent as they occur in other cities, this doesn't mean hate crimes are completely obscure throughout the city. 

A major hate crime that occurred not that long ago in our very own backyard was when Carl Zablotny, editor and publisher of Wire, a gay weekly magazine. He was followed by a group of gay bashers as they screamed obscenities such as, "Don't worry, he's one of those - he's a fag and he won't do anything."

As Zablotny reached for his cell phone to call the police, the men struck him, knocking him to the ground and began to beat him. 

Zablotny suffered severe injuries to his face, forehead and torso.

Paradise is hard to find, and incidents like that of Zablotny just prove that no matter where you live, no matter how safe you feel, ignorance is still a vital problem community has to deal with. 

Miami might not be the worst place to live if you are gay, but it still has its demeaning attributes.  

If you ever experience a hate crime on or off campus, whether it is due to sexual orientation, ethnicity or religion, contact the Victim Advocacy Center's 24 hour hotline at 305-348-3000.

&nbsp;
I disagree strongly with Christine Liriano's article on the issue of phone jammers ("Phone jammers excessive in theaters"); to me this is the best idea and has been long in coming. 

I fully understand that some people may need their cell phones for emergencies, but we often forget that before cell phones, people went to the movie theatres, out to the opera and functioned in every day life without these cell phones. 

If you are so disabled by not having your cell phone operate at all times, then I think there is a larger problem. 

Furthermore, because people apparently are not considerate enough in silencing their phones. I think silencing it for them is the best idea, especially when those inconsiderate individuals are apt to ruin a perfectly good evening (and expensive) because they did not want to turn their phones off.

Until people begin to be more considerate of others (which probably wont happen soon) then I think these types of measures are appropriate, necessary and something I strongly support.

Headline: Act vital to protect innocence
Author: Ruth Barrocas / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Twenty-four years after being sent to prison, Alan Crotzer regained his freedom when he was exonerated by DNA evidence. 

The 45-year-old St. Petersburg man was among the five men cleared in the state of Florida by the Florida Innocence Initiative Act. He spent nearly a quarter of a century in prison for a crime he did not commit. 

Accused of robbing a Tampa family, using  a sawed-off shotgun in July 1981, Crotzer was found guilty of kidnapping and raping the mother and daughter. While in a police photo lineup, he was picked out by one of the victims and was prosecuted.

 His sentence of 130-years was cut short when, in a review of the evidence, his DNA was not found on the victims. All of this was thanks to the Florida Innocence Initiative's ability to test physical evidence.

Like him, there have been others acquitted by the Florida Innocence Initiative. The Initiative's goal is to exonerate individuals who are not guilty of committing a crime through the use of "post-condition DNA testing in the State of Florida."

They are also known for providing legal services to individuals who would otherwise be unable to take on legal assistance or file claims of unjust convictions. The Initiative is committed to its goal to train and educate the attorneys of tomorrow, in order to better defend the innocent and to provide the public with information about wrongful convictions.

In July of this year, however, the law that allows these inmates to prove their innocence will expire. On Sept. 9, 2005, the Florida Criminal Procedure Rules Committee voted unanimously to file an emergency petition to the Supreme Court of Florida proposing the elimination of any deadline to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.853. 

As such, in March, lawmakers will come together to hopefully make this law permanent.

The United States is a nation based on the surfacing of truth and the freedom of the common man. The FII allows innocent individuals to have their freedom back.

Prior to the existence of the initiative, Barry Scheck, founder of the Innocence Project, traveled to Florida State University's law school when the statute of limitations for filing post conviction DNA motions was six months and no organized effort to assist the hundreds of inmates seeking legal help existed. He worked with a few students from FSU, searching over 200 cases, in order to assess the viability.

In the best interest of the American public, it is important that we keep laws which protect the innocent. It is evident that most current political leaders in the state of Florida are siding with eliminating the deadline for this law. Citizens are asked to consider if it is truly honorable for us to take the right away from these individuals who claim to be innocent. 

If there is even the slightest possibility that they do not deserve a life behind bars, is it not our job as fair and just Americans, of a fair and just society, to give them some way to prove their inncoence.

I believe that it is only right to let the truth become evident. 

The Florida Innocence Initiative gives people the opportunity to prove they are innocent; we should definitely make sure more laws like this are actively kept.

Headline: Akens "advocates" for students
Author: Jackie Diaz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The new year has brought changes to student affairs at the Biscayne Bay Campus. In December 2005, Cathy Akens was appointed assistant vice president of Student Affairs and began her position Jan. 9. 

Akens essential role is to provide leadership to the Division of Student Affairs at BBC as well as Residential Life on both campuses. 

"It is my goal to ensure that the programs and services we provide to students support their academic success at the University," Akens said. 

Through this goal, Student Affairs would like to see students involved on campus and enjoying their college experience. 

"When students feel a connection to other students, faculty and staff, and when they feel supported they are more likely to succeed," she said.

Student Affairs works in conjunction with many departments to achieve their goals of enriching the students learning experience, including Campus Life, International Students and Scholars Services, Residential Life and the Health and Wellness Centers among others. 

Akens also hopes to establish a strong relationship with Student Government and other student leaders around campus. 

"While I truly enjoy these opportunities to interact with students, these relationships will particularly assist me in knowing how to best advocate for the needs of our students," Akens said. 

Most seem to be satisfied with the new appointment.

"She's a true professional, nurturing with lots of experience in student affairs," said Gregory Olson, senior director of student affairs. "Everyone [who] works with her feels privileged to do so. She also provides great leadership." 

Aside from her new profession, Akens also teaches graduate courses in the Higher Education program at FIU. 

"I teach a course called College Student Development Theory for students who are aspiring to work in Student Affairs as a career," Akens said. 

The course deals with the study of college students and how they learn and develop during the college experience. 

According to Akens, the knowledge that is gained about students helps aspiring professionals and current staff learn the best method to impact the educational experience of students. 

Akens, a native of Cleveland Ohio, came to Miami 12 years ago when offered a job at FIU. 

She began her work at the University as an associate director of housing believing she would only stay a couple of years and has been here since. 

"The University has given me a great opportunity to advance professionally," she said. 

Her interest in pursuing Student Affairs came when she was an undergraduate student at the University of Toledo. 

"I was involved as a student and worked a couple of different jobs, including as a resident assistant and in an advising office," Akens said.

It was through these experiences that she realized how much she enjoyed the university environment. 

"I was fortunate that a supervisor talked to me about turning those interests into a career," she said. 

After receiving her bachelor's degree in Communications, she earned her master's degree from Michigan State University in college and university administration and later earned a doctorate degree in higher education at FIU.

Headline: Dem Franchize Boyz fail to deliver
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Listening to On Top of Our Game - the new album of the group Dem Franchize Boyz - is like listening to a compilation of different artists due to the group's lack of originality.

The Atlanta based foursome - Parlae, Pimpin, Jizzal Man and Buddie signed under Jermaine Dupri - fail to stand out from other rap artists on their second album.

On Top of Our Game is like everything the hip-hop world has heard before. In fact, the only game the group is on top of is music from other artists.

On "Ridin' Rims," DFB sounds more like the Big Tymers's Manny Fresh and Bryan "Baby" Williams as they rap about 23 inch rims, Alpine radios and car TVs. 

The uncanny resemblance between DFB and the Big Tymers is definitely noticed when they call themselves "No. 1 Stunnas," one of the Big Tymers's nicknames and the name of a track that helped them reach mainstream level.

The group tries to hard to have an album full of club hits that on "Lean Wit' It," the group's crunk style can't disguise the similarities on the chorus to Fat Joe's "Lean Back." The beat and flow are identical. Again, the group makes it obvious as they rap, "Lean back like Fat Joe and snap your wrist back."

The two best tracks on the album - "I Think They Like Me," and "Bricks 4 The High," - are due to its guest artists. On "I think they like me," Dupri, Da Brat and Bow Wow provide some of the best verses on the album. On "Bricks 4 The High," Jim Jones blows away DFB with a true rap flow, compared to DFB's crunk hip-hop style.

A common theme on every song is DFB's constant mention of white T's. They mention it so much that it makes you wonder whether they make a profit for every white tee sold in the United States.

One of the only different songs on the album is "Freaky As She Wanna Be," which includes an R&B chorus. On the track, the group compares themselves to King Tut, insinuating they are the kings of the club. While their music is catchy at the club, they are definitely not the kings of lyrics.

While the album does have a good mix of beats, the rap flow of DFB is weak. This is not an album to stack next to your Jay-Z and Tupac collection, but with your party music that is only hot for a short while.

Headline: Influential guitarist's tribute album befitting, haunting
Author: Laura Jokisch / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Despite the fact that John Fahey is considered to be one of the greatest guitarists of all time, the chances of you recognizing his name are slim to none - but you know his work. 

His ghost echoes throughout genres much more popular than his own as uneasily categorized melding of folk, blues, industrial, classical, country and electronic experimentation, as well as the native sounds of India, Southeast Asia and the Scottish Highlands which reinvented the steel-string acoustic guitar as a solo instrument.

Like all great artists, he was not fully appreciated during his lifetime. It took three years to sell a meager 95 copies of his first album, Blind Joe Death in 1959, which is now considered a treasure by collectors. 

Fahey wrote music that musicians listen to and his influence resonates through every sect of truly alternative music, from the indie-pop of The Shins and The Decemberists to the art-punk of Sonic Youth to folksy singer-songwriters like Sam Beam of Iron & Wine.

His diverse disciples have gathered under the direction of producers Stephen Brower and Matt Ward - a songwriter who may be better known to our generation for his collaborations with Bright Eyes and My Morning Jacket - to cover their favorite Fahey recordings for I Am The Resurrection, a collaborative 13-track tribute released Feb. 14 on Vanguard Records. 

The eclectic line-up on Resurrection is a testament to the late guitarist's legacy, attracting artists as varied as David Immergluck of Counting Crows, Camper Van Beethoven's Victor Krummenacher, indie-rock band Calexico, solo psychedelic powerhouse Devendra Banhart and post-rock instrumentalists Cul de Sac. 

In order to unite their vision to prevent one of America's most gifted guitar players from being forgotten by the mainstream, they have guided themselves to assemble a seamless, cohesive tribute album of haunting melodies.

The end result is at once primitive and sophisticated, intense and lighthearted; a varied but coherent track listing of instrumentals which weave a flowing paradox that does Fahey justice. The Fruit Bat's cover of "Death of the Clayton Peacock" is easy on the ears and heavy on the heart, while "When the Catfish is in Bloom" as performed by Peter Case of the Plimsouls pulses with a playful energy and surreal darkness flickers at the edge of Calexico's "Dance of Death." 

The highlight of the album is found in "Variation on 'Commemorative Transfiguration & Communion at Magruder Park,'" courtesy of acclaimed multi-instrumentalist Sufjan Stevens, who, in true Fahey fashion, is no stranger to bold experimentation, wandering freely between banjo and electronica. 

Stevens contribution is a sweetly melancholy track that opens with the pointedly cheerful atmosphere of a Wes Anderson film, gradually devolves until a well-timed upswing of new vigor and exits with simple, bittersweet vocals. 

The album wraps up with the interesting addition of a piano rendition of "My Grandfather's Clock." As Howe Gelb, formerly of Giant Sand explained, "[Fahey] can play guitar like a piano player, which I can relate to from playing the piano like a guitar player." 

However, as Fahey said of his own album City of Refuge, "I have trouble picturing who's going to listen to it. Who's going to buy it?" 

The little recognition Fahey received late in his life before he passed away in 2001 came after he transitioned into industrial rock. At the time he was playing the ambient acoustic folk commemorated by the majority of the artists on this compilation, he was playing stranger's weddings and living in motels. The market for his music is tragically modest.

Subheadline: Skateboarders from around city attracted to campus's unique structure
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Every day, skaters can be seen all over University Park riding their boards and speeding around buildings; blurs whizzing by as one exits the Green Library. 

In 2003, the Miami New Times named UP as the best spot for guerilla skating, or skating without the confines of an official park. The various garages, handicap ramps, railings and stairwells on campus let skaters execute their best techniques. 

Although skating in parking garages and doing tricks off handicap rails are popular actions among FIU skaters, many of them have used their boards as not only a means of perfecting their skills, but as a legitimate form of campus transport as well.

"I always hear about kids coming to FIU at night and using the garages or rails to improve their skills and have some fun," said junior Jose Rodriguez. "I just use my board to get me from one place to another around [campus.] If I'm running late, using my skateboard is quicker than running to class."

According to the 2005-2006 Student Handbook, "the use or operation of rollerblades, skates, skateboards, bicycles, mopeds … inside of University facilities" is prohibited. Nevertheless, some students do not take these rules seriously. If they're too fast to be caught, who can hold them responsible? 

"FIU is an ideal place for skating. Unlike a lot of other locations, it's free to skate [here] and it offers plenty of opportunities for awesome tricks and cool moves," said sophomore David Shaw.

While FIU students can be seen using their skateboards daily around campus, UP has also been used as a skating haven by non-FIU students. Skating enthusiasts living near campus stop by throughout the day and use the terrain to their advantage.

"There are almost no good places to skate around in Miami," said Nova Southeastern University sophomore Javier Blanco. "Because there are a lot of hills around FIU, it's a really good place for me and my friends to skate. Plus, the ramps in the parking garages are great for skaters, too."

Even though University regulations forbid the use of skateboards within facilities, Blanco does not believe the rule is strictly enforced.

"I skate at FIU two to three times a week and I've never had any real problems. There aren't many people on campus at night and I've only been bothered once by security. They just told my friends and me to be careful. We were just having fun and not hurting anyone," Blanco said.

However, other skaters have had problems with officials, but they don't let that stop them from skateboarding.

"Sometimes I'm sick of walking so I throw down my skateboard and ride it all over campus and occasionally through buildings. I get yelled at by the building officials, but I'm too quick to get caught by them. It's more convenient than walking, that's for sure," said a freshman who wished to remain anonymous.

Although the skateboarders believe they are not harming anyone, the increased popularity of campus skating has annoyed some students.

"As I'm walking to class behind the library, there's always some guy skating around and whizzing past me," said junior Kristel Lopez. " I've started to get scared of hearing those skateboard wheels whirring behind me. It makes me think I'm going to get hit from behind."

Chip Steeler, the Frost Art Museum's Sculpture Park coordinator, shared similar feelings about campus skateboarders and their use of the campus sculptures for tricks. 

"There's this sculpture named Torre Pieno Nel Vuoto in the Deuxieme Maison amphitheater that skaters have damaged as a result of their grinding. I actually filed a police report about the damage. I haven't seen skaters actually skate off the sculptures, but the evidence is there," said Steeler. "I grew up skating, so I know the cause of the damage."

Nevertheless, UP has been the center of attention for many Miami skaters. MySpace groups such as Sector Niners post pictures of their UP exploits and several online skating interviews list it as a skating hotspot. As word-of-mouth continues to spread about the campus landscape, UP's reputation as a local skateboarding paradise will inevitably grow.

Headline: Howard Dean relates with students during campus visit
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Howard Dean, former candidate for the Democratic presidential ticket and current chairman of the Democratic National Committee, spoke to FIU students and Democrats alike at the Graham Center Ballrooms on Feb. 14. 

Dean appeared at FIU to speak about the policies of the Democratic Party, U.S. foreign policy issues concerning Latin America, immigration issues as well as criticizing the current Republican administration. FIU's College Democrats and the Democratic National Committee sponsored the event.

"What we're trying to do is bring important democrats such as Mr. Dean to campuses across the country," said LaToia A. Jones, executive director of the College Democrats of America. "We try to get students involved by organizing events such as these regularly."

Senior Wolfgang Vale agreed with Jones.

"By visiting various campuses, the Democrats are trying to reduce the distance between politics and young voters in this country," Vale, who is majoring in TV production, said.

Introduced by John Parker, advisor to FIU's College Democrats, Dean began his lecture by speaking about Democratic policy.

"I'm here to talk about Democratic policy and where we're going. I'm also going to have a little fun at the president's expense," Dean said.

Dean criticized President George W.  Bush's administration and described it as being incompetent. Speaking to a room full of Democrat supporters, Dean's comments were occasionally greeted with applause.

"They have the largest budget deficit in the history of the United States; they can't manage Iraq; they couldn't manage Katrina and they have yet to find Osama. In fact, I can't think of anything they've actually managed," Dean said
 
Apart from bashing the Republican Party, Dean addressed the agendas of the Democratic Party since he became chairman of in February 2005.

"When I became chairman, we decided to do things differently," he said. "We will no longer limit our campaign to 18 states, but we'll be campaigning in every state."

Under Dean's leadership, the Democratic Party has worked on a list of agendas which they aim to see through if they are elected at the state level this fall and in the White House in 2008. 

As Dean began reading the list of agendas to the crowd, he challenged them to time him as he bet he would read them within 25 seconds.

"We want honesty and openness in our government; we want a strong national defense based on telling the truth to our citizens, soldiers and allies; we want American jobs that will stay in America; we want a health care system that works for everybody and we want a public education system that will allow optimism and opportunity to come back to everybody in America," Dean said.

Speaking exclusively with The Beacon, Dean encouraged the activity of youth in politics.

"We had a great operation called College Democrats and we're going to have a chapter at every campus in the United States," he said. "The great thing is we want to talk to younger people about public office and not just work in the campaigns as volunteers. We're actually trying to get some students to run for office."

Answering a question on the deficit, Dean lashed out against Republicans, stating that not one Republican president in the last 40 years has balanced the national budget. He also accused Republicans of lying about Hurricane Katrina, the Iraq War and the national budget.


"Deficit is a big issue for younger people because they know they will have to pay the bill. [Democrats] don't believe in deficits, but Republicans do. We will balance the budget in this country. These are the issues we believe the young voters should keep in mind," Dean said.

Dean also spoke to the audience about Latin America and its importance. He defined Miami as a drop-off point, in the sense that no city in the United States trades with Latin America as much as Miami.
 
Speaking about illegal immigrants, Dean said that America's borders have to be secured, but that the government also has to be mindful of the contribution people have made. Dean spoke about having a discussion with a handful of Mexican leaders who also didn't like the state of affairs.

"They too don't like illegal immigration because they are losing their people as a work source," he said. "They want to work together with the United States [in order] to help both countries' economies."

Senior Charles Hall liked the fact that Dean talked about international problems, as well as national ones. 

"I liked that he emphasized immigration issues because this is a country of immigrants," said Hall, who is majoring in electrical engineering.

Dean concluded his speech promising the audience that Democrats will offer a different vision for the country; a vision that the current president cannot offer.

"He has poisoned this country by dividing us: dividing us by immigration status, dividing us by race, dividing us by sexual orientation; dividing us in so many ways," Dean said. 
"This is a country that was founded on hope and after 2006, will be founded on hope once again."

Headline: Students petition against hate speech on campus
Author:  Ashley Capo / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
As many students at the University Park campus have been aware of since Jan. 31, cutting across the fountain near the Green Library has been no easy task, seeing as it has been the podium for evangelist Christian Jed Smock and, as his companions call themselves, the "Jed Heads," a group representing Campus Ministry USA who are known for riling up crowds with their religious speeches.

After many angry slurs, picket signs and banners, the Alliance of Diversity, a student organization comprised of campus groups like  the National Organization for Women and Amnesty International, decided it was time to fight back. 

The students gathered to protest against what they perceived as the hateful language of the Campus Ministry USA on Feb. 14, expecting Smock to use his permit and once again return to the university. The only thing missing on that day, though, was Smock.

"Even though he didn't show up, it was still a success due to the fact that we have gotten signatures to prevent people from preaching hate," said junior Ryan Jones, a co-founder of the Alliance of Diversity. "It would've been more effective [to our cause] if he was here; in this case, we did, sort of, get what we wanted - which was preventing him from preaching hate here on campus."

The petition, which was given to passerbys to sign, will be sent to the faculty of the political science department to see if they can help the group take action  against the speakers, who have been accused of using hateful and discriminatory language as attacks on the religions, sexuality and race of FIU students.

"A girl next to me was accused of automatically having STDs just because she dressed a certain way which wasn't even, how some people say, provocative at all," said senior Maciel Cuellar. "They can preach what they believe in, but don't go against people like that. That's not right."

Senior Muhammed Malik, a member of Amnesty International, took great offense to Smock's demonstrations, as he found him to be abusive toward another Middle-Eastern student by calling her "a terrorist."

"He created not only an environment of hate and intolerance, but of danger. There's a link between actual actions and what you're trying to say. That's what the petition is all about," Malik said.

The FIU student code of conduct is quoted in the petition, stating that "students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner in which exemplifies respect for people of all races, religions and ethnic groups, and to adhere to one's personal values without unduly imposing them on others." 

However, Jones believes that it is every students' responsibility to take action if they see individual rights being violated.

"I think there needs to be a call to action from students," Jones said." There needs to be a sense of revolution from the students to make changes here on campus if there is hate speech. You can't walk around campus and think about how much you hate it, you need to stand up and do something."

Headline: SGA in process of budget deliberations
Author:  Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Government Association began conducting its annual Budget Hearing process Jan. 27 and is expected to continue with the hearings throughout February. 

The decisions are made by the voting council of the SGA which include president Alex Prado and vice president Christine Denton, who will determine how much money will be allocated to organizations in the upcoming academic year.

During the proceedings various university-wide and regional University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus based organizations will present their proposals to the council.

The SGA has two sets of budget hearings. There are the University-wide hearings - which are usually conducted first - and then  the campus based organizations. The University-wide hearings include the cases put forward by organizations and departments which have a single budget for both campuses.

 Departments which fall under this category include the Student Alumni Association (SAA), the recreation center, the volunteer action center, the center for leadership, the radio station Radiate 88 and The Beacon. 

"It is usually the organization leaders, directors or presidents who show up to present their cases to the SGA along with their advisors," Prado said.

During the budget-hearing process, organizations are given between 10 to 15 minutes to present their case to the voting body of the SGA and persuade the members why they need the budget they want.

Once the University-wide hearings have concluded, the voting body starts its system of deliberations during which the voting body takes a look at the money the SGA has and the money they allocated to a particular organization during the previous academic year. 

"We do this to see if the organization needs the increase in budget or not," Denton said. "Because everyone proposes an increase, we have to see who needs the increase the most, who isn't using the money responsibly and who will gain the most and who has more money than required."

The second set of hearings, the campus - based hearings, take place once the University-wide deliberations have concluded and the funds for these organizations have been allocated. During this period, the student government of each campus independently reviews the proposals of their campus based organizations. 

For example, the SGA of UP will preside over hearings of organizations solely based at UP, whereas the SGA of the BBC will respectively preside over hearings at the BBC. 

Organizations which fall under this category include the Student Organizations Council (SOC), Student Programming Council (SPC), Greek Affairs, Panther Rage and Homecoming. 

Like the University-wide hearings, the campus based hearings are followed by their own set of deliberations, during which the voting body again votes on what decisions will be made as to who gets what and why.

"We break down everyone's budgets and look at what they have done. Be it SPC with their concerts, comedy shows and films or SOC and their various organizations," said Nancy Cadavid, Comptroller for the UP SGA. "We review their proposals in past years and see if they used the money they were allocated wisely." 

The SGA conducts its budget hearings every year during mid-March and early April. 

However, they decided to bump up the proceedings this year to an earlier time because John Bonanno, assistant vice president of student affairs, will be retiring  March 1.

"He is a great asset in our decision making process," Prado said.

Roughly seven and a half million dollars of budget money comes from students' activities and service fees and are allocated to the organizations in August at the beginning of each Fall semester. 

Since the budget is only allocated at this time, organizations must creatively make use of their current budgets for the Summer semester.

The SGA has only presided over the University- wide hearings. 

The deliberation process is expected to take place Feb. 17, with the campus based hearings set for Feb. 24.

"We haven't come to any decision as yet," Denton said. "The final decisions will only be made in the following weeks."
