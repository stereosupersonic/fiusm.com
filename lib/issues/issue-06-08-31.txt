Headline: Former Golden Panther discusses life in MLS
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
For former FIU defender Bobby Boswell, playing soccer professionally was a childhood dream that came to fruition last summer when he was signed by D.C. United. 

This season, Boswell has started 23 of United's 24 games and has recorded one goal and one assist. In addition, he was named to the 2006 MLS All-Star team that beat English Premier League Champion Chelsea 1-0 Aug. 5 in Bridgeview, Ill.

The Beacon was able to get a hold of Boswell through e-mail before his All-Star game appearance.

Q: What went through your head when you found out you were selected to the All-Star Team?

I was excited to be selected as an All-Star. We have a really good team this year and have been performing well. I believe that is why you see so many players from D.C. United on the all-star team.

Q: While you were playing soccer growing up, did you ever think you would be playing soccer professionally - much less make an All-Star team?

As a kid, I always dreamed of playing soccer at the highest level. For soccer that is the World Cup. I hope to one day represent the U.S. at that stage. I am happy to be playing in the MLS and I am excited about the all-star selection as well.

Q: How does it feel and what do you think you'll get out of playing a European powerhouse like Chelsea?

Playing a team like Chelsea is an awesome experience because it brings the best out of you as an individual. Last year we played them with DC United and were able to compete even though they were in their preseason. I look forward to playing against some of the best players in the world.

Q: Have you been contemplating a move to Europe? If so, how much of a possibility is it and what country would you like to play in?

I don't really think about going to Europe that much because I am still developing here with D.C. United. If a club over there expresses interest then I will think about that accordingly.

Q: You earned your first international cap earlier this year. How did it feel to suit up for your country?

That was the highlight of my career thus far because, like I said earlier, I want to play in a World Cup. To do that, you have to be playing for your national team. I hope to play more with them in the near future to show what I can do on the international level.

Q: What did you think of the U.S. performance in this past World Cup?

I think that we had a really tough group and that we looked good at some times and poor at others. I wish a couple of the younger guys would have had a chance to play a little more to show what they could bring to the table. But overall, I think that we had a tough group and didn't have some things go our way.

Q: Will you be on the squad in 2010 in South Africa?

That is a goal of mine and I am working everyday to better my chances.

Q: Do you really think Freddy Adu is only 17-years-old?

Yes, I do. He is a friend of mine, as well as a teammate. He is a good kid.

Subheadline: Men's soccer team looks to capture first Conference-USA championship
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team isn't familiar with its current position. 

FIU usually enters each season prepared to defend a conference championship, but it has only ambition and doubts to carry into the 2006 campaign.

After winning four Atlantic Soccer Conference championships in five years, FIU lost its top-dog status when it joined Conference-USA in 2005. 

The Golden Panthers finished the season 8-7-2, losing to Marshall in the first round of the C-USA Tournament.

The reigning champ had suddenly become just another hopeful contender.

"C-USA is a huge step-up in terms of the quality of teams," head coach Karl Kremser said during a recent practice. "You're in for a fight every game - every minute of every game - and that's something we haven't adjusted to yet."

Adjusting is an inescapable theme for FIU. 

As the team practices at Miami- Dade College Kendall Campus -- field conditions at University Park are momentarily inadequate - key players from last year's squad are noticeably absent. 

Leading goal-scorer Carron Williams and assist-leader Lucas Scudeler have both graduated, leaving FIU with only five returning starters. 

But the pressure that comes from losing so many players doesn't seem to faze sophomore forward Levi Coleman.

"I prefer to have it like that and be expected to score goals," Coleman said as he rested a slightly bruised rib. "It's a rebuilding year, but I think we'll be alright. Me and David [Hope] are returning up front and we have experience under our belt.

"Personally, I'm trying to average a goal per game."

Coaches hope to improve a revamped Golden Panther attack that opponents tamed in 2005. FIU averaged 1.82 goals per game but struggled to score late in the season.

"The team played well as a unit in the beginning and then that all fell apart," Kremser said. "We were so busy defending last year that we couldn't really go forward.

"We've got some pretty good defensive help this year. We should be fine in the back and hopefully get some goals." 

That has Coleman eyeing a C-USA championship and a possible NCAA tournament berth. 

"[FIU] has made it before and we didn't get into the tournament last year," he said. "I feel like it's our responsibility to make it back this year."

Entering his 30th coaching season, Kremser estimates FIU to be in the middle of a competitive C-USA championship race. He expects a few key games to determine the team's chances.

And what about a national championship?

FIU hasn't reached the NCAA College Cup since losing to St. John's in the 1996 championship game. 

Ten years later, the chance of a similar title-run seems unlikely. 

"I think we're going to be solid, but whether we're going to have a team of that caliber remains to be seen," Kremser said.

That uncertainty is exactly why players start practice as soon as the team bus arrives at MDC-Kendall. There's much to be done if they want another trophy to polish.

Will FIU finish the season with more hardware? 

Here's a breakdown of the team:


FORWARDS:
When Levi Coleman and Judah Hernandez were named to the C-USA all-freshmen team in 2005, the duo appeared to be the future of FIU's offense.

Hernandez withdrew from school to become a professional soccer player, leaving Coleman and senior David Hope to lead the attack. 

Kremser says the team will rely heavily on both forwards, but he expects contributions from several new players, including freshman striker/midfielder Christian Caporaletti. 

"Anywhere I can play is fine with me," Caporaletti said. "Coach told me that I might be able to play, so I'm just trying to do my best and make the starting team."


MIDFIELDERS:
Replacing All C-USA midfielders Lucas Scudeler and Jared Rose is challenging, but the task is even harder without expected starter Juan Guerra. 

The speedy sophomore is likely to miss the entire season after injuring his right foot playing club soccer in Mexico. 

FIU is thin at midfield, so junior Edgard Corrêa and sophomore Bruno Barbosa will be asked to fill the void. They will receive help from a number of new players, including freshman Cesar DeOliveira. 

A few players listed as forwards or defenders may also see playing time in the midfield.


DEFENSE:
FIU's 1.49 goals against average in 2005 ranked eighth in C-USA, but Kremser expects a more dependable defense this season. Seniors Chris Handy and Sheldon Jardine lead the retooled but promising unit. 

Coaches believe freshman Raoul Voss and Icelandic transfer students Oli Birgisson and Dadi Krstjánsson will help strengthen the back line. 

Senior goalkeeper Shawn Crowe will need that added assistance. Opponents constantly pressured him last season as he faced 81 shots on goal. Freshman goalkeeper Michael Anderson may play as well, but Crowe's athleticism and experience firmly roots him between the posts. That could be the foundation for a surprise title run.


C-USA OUTLOOK:
Southern Methodist is unquestionably the team to beat. The Mustangs return eight starters from a squad that reached the 2005 College Cup semi-finals. 

A majority of C-USA coaches project SMU to win the conference.

Defending Conference-USA Tournament Champion South Carolina is another threat. The Gamecocks are stacked with eight seniors and a freshman class that features five high-school All-Americans. 

Veterans and heralded recruits at UAB, UCF and Tulsa also stand in the way of FIU's hopes for conference supremacy.

"It's going to be a real dog fight," Kremser said.

Headline: Commuting: a mixed blessing
Subheadline: Networking, staying close to family a plus; student life suffers
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I love going back to school. I always have, ever since I was seven and had big, nerdy, blue glasses. I've outgrown the glasses, but not my appreciation for the smell of new books, even if I now have to buy them myself. 

You may or may not be as excited about returning to schook as I am, but the start of a new semester is a good time to take inventory of how our college experience is going so far, and why we've made the school choice we have. What exactly are the pros and cons of coming to FIU, or to any commuter school in general? 

About 93% of FIU students live off-campus, and their commute is likely to be longer in a metropolis like Miami than in the average college town. Even after factoring in gas money, however, FIU is still a very economical college choice. 

I know we go up in arms whenever tuition is raised, but let's not forget that many of our friends have had to take out loans to complete their degrees out of town and many of us haven't had to do so. This allows us to at least postpone any loans until graduate school, which is becoming an increasingly advantageous way to prepare for our future careers.

Some students who chose to remain in town for school see proximity to family and friends as a major benefit, especially if they have strong ties in Miami that they are unwilling to leave yet. 

Although I've witnessed many students remain just as close to their families and best friends after moving away, Chemistry junior Johnny Betancourt has a point when he says, "Many students want to keep their same social circle and a lot of people would hate to displace themselves from where they're at." 

Who is to say that this choice is inferior, or that these students are selling themselves short, if they are content with their own choice? 

In addition, from a career-minded perspective, remaining in the same social circle may possibly be a benefit. We are constantly told to network in order to advance our futures, and remaining in Miami could potentially help students build on the foundational relationships they already established during their high school years.

I'm not too much of a morning person. So imagine being able to wake up only about ten minutes before class, skip 30 to 60 minutes of horrendous traffic, save gas money, and walk across campus to class - definite benefit to living on campus, and a con for the commuter. 

More importantly, fostering a sense of community can be extremely challenging at a commuter school, where too many students (myself included) take their classes and leave, without becoming involved in student events. 

The unity, school spirit, and general collegiate atmosphere we might enjoy when we visit friends at their non-commuter campuses are missing here at FIU. 

It follows from this that it is often difficult to get special interest groups, such as Christian campus ministries, off the ground and growing in commuter schools, where students are less likely to make it to meetings if they do not live conveniently on campus. 

As legitimate as these points are, students often use them as an excuse for failing to get plugged in and to establish strong relationships that will last beyond their college years. 

So, granted, many of you may not have a book fetish as I do, and may not exactly have been welcoming Aug. 28 with open arms, but as you're looking for parking or waiting in line at Starbucks, take a second to evaluate your own customized pro/con list, your own personal highs and lows at the commuter institution we call FIU.

Headline: Student-teacher chemistry as important as hard work
Author: Jonel Cupidore / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Summer semester is over and so are the cramming and late night sessions at the library.  I'm certainly glad the hard work is over.  How does one define "hard work?"  In my book, it means getting an A but nothing lower that a B.  For me, waiting for my grades to post is the least stressful part of the whole semester.

A classmate and I were having a discussion the other day about how we believe professors arrive at students' grades. His opinion was that some professors give out passing grades to students who do not deserve them. 

I, on the other hand, believe that college professors are fair when it comes to grading. There are many slackers, but there are also serious students. Why would professors give students passing grades just to be popular? They have to earn respect from students, in the same manner that we earn grades. 

I have been attending FIU for the past three years, and so far I haven't encountered one professor who I believe has not given me the grade I've deserved.

The classroom can be viewed as a professor's little domain. In the first class meeting, the rules are handed down, usually in the form of a syllabus. 

Some professors go further in setting down the law. One in particular went as far as telling the class that eating was not allowed because she found the rustling of candy wrappers and potato chips bags to be very distracting. 

The first class meeting is a good indicator of what the rest of the semester will be like. One should feel comfortable and at ease with the professor. 

A few semesters back, I took MAC 1105, College Algebra. If I had followed this rule of thumb, I would have dropped that class the same day. 

When the professor started making his notes on the board, I knew I was in trouble. With what must have been complete dismay in my voice, I said to him that I was confused about what he was writing. Without looking at me, he offered that I evidently had not taken a math class in a long time. He was absolutely right, because I had not been in school for about eighteen years. Here I was, working on a Bachelor's degree in English, wondering why I needed MAC1105 anyhow.  

After the first MAC test, I decided that I should let the professor know that I was an English major. "I just need to pass this class with a "C," was my pitch. He undauntedly offered to help me in any way he could. And yes, he saw how hard I was trying.  After every class session, I left with a MAC-sized headache. 

I gave it my best effort. I worked as hard as I could, given the fact that I also had a full time job to handle. I even visited the math lab, where I was tutored by a student who I swear must have been a direct descendent of Pythagoras. 

However, no amount of studying was enough for me to learn this "useless" subject. Thankfully that class came to an end, and yes, I received a failing grade. 

I took that class again, with a different professor, and I passed it with a "B." I guess my hard work did end up paying off after all.

Sure, hard work is important, especially if the subject is not one you like. However, there should also be a certain sort of chemistry between the student and the professor. If that certain something is not apparent by session one, then it might be a good idea to head back to the online registration site. 

If a little help is needed in choosing the right professor, try the "Student Assessment of Instructors" on the Current Student section of the FIU webpage. Of course, keep in mind that these are all objective assessments. 

Personally, I don't bother looking at them. I just go with the basics: Can I comprehend what the professor is saying? Will I be able to achieve the goals that have been set, such as papers and special projects? If I have to work hard, then so be it.

Headline: Merged schools form new college
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
University officials announced the creation of a new College of Architecture and the Arts last July.

The new college, which had been under the development phases for a period of more than two years, is expected to strengthen the relationship between the new departments in the college and enhance FIU's standing in the arts and design community.

The College of Architecture and the Arts is the merger of the School of Architecture, the School of Art and Art History, the School of Music, the School of Theatre and Dance and Speech Communication.

These schools will now be departments in the new College. Additionally, the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum will also be a part of the new college.

"These fields have many overlapping and complementary areas that make them extremely compatible under the same administrative unit," said interim Provost and Executive Vice President Ronald Berkman through a press release. "The establishment of this new College will undoubtedly serve to enhance each of the programs and continue to position FIU as an integral component of Miami's burgeoning art and design scene."

With the new college, students will be able to enroll in classes outside their field of study. 

According to Juan Antonio Bueno, founding Dean of the College of Architecture and the Arts, one of the reasons for the creation of the new college was to enable the art departments to receive more attention from the administration.

"Since the departments will be in a smaller school, they will receive more focus and attention than when they were in the College of Arts and Sciences," Bueno said. Bueno also expects changes in the current curriculum in the upcoming semesters. 

"The faculty of the departments within the College will be able to look into the current curriculum and make changes for the betterment of the students."

A significant change, due to the merger, will be the addition of a developing officer, a new position. 

The primary duty of a developing officer is to acquire external funds for the college by identifying, soliciting and cultivating relationships with donors, sponsors and organizations. 

With the developing officer, the arts would finally be able to receive support from the community and receive additional funding for their programs.

The idea for a college merging the Art and Architecture departments was brought to Bueno more than two years ago by former Provost Mark Rosenberg. After the decision was reviewed by several faculty committees who pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of the process, the proposal was sent through to the Faculty Senate earlier this year and finally to Rosenberg who made the decision along with University President Modesto A.  Maidique and Berkman.

Although the College was only recently inaugurated, the College of Architecture and the Arts has already signed an agreement with Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden to work on a several projects relating to landscaping, art and architecture.

"I'm very excited about FIU's new agreement with Fairchild," Bueno said. "Among the various programs they'll be collaborating with us is a design competition for the [Architecture] students."

Bueno, who previously served as the Dean of the College of Architecture, will now serve as Dean of the College of Architecture and the Arts.

He will supervise directors of the different departments in the college, who in turn will supervise over department chairs and faculty.

"We have three priorities right now. Serve the students, organize the college and engage the community," Bueno said. "There's going to be more collaborative work and more inter-dependence and students will be able to see infinite possibilities in this new environment."

Headline: STORM HALTS FIU
Subheadline: Campus students forced to evacuate
Author: C. Joel Marino and Reuben Pereira / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
The University shut its doors for two days and evacuated housing students in preparation for Tropical Storm Ernesto, which remained a storm with 75 mph winds or less as of press time.

Classes were canceled Aug. 29 and Aug. 30.

A message on the University's website also informed students that registration deadlines would be extended, though it did not specify those dates.

Following hurricane procedures established by the Office of Residential Life, students living at the Biscayne Bay campus' Bay Vista housing were evacuated Aug. 29 by bus.

They arrived at Everglades Hall in University Park in the afternoon.

Students from the UP Apartments, Panther Hall and the new Lakeview Village crowded into EH's small lounges and lined up along the narrow hallways, many complaining over the Housing Office's mandatory evacuation.

"I don't think necessarily moving everyone to Everglades is the best idea because it's the building that got the most messed up last year," said Rajiv Kirpalani, a junior living in EH. "During Wilma, we stayed in Towers and that was a much stronger hurricane."

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Hurricane Wilma was the most powerful storm to form over the Atlantic in recorded history.

 After much of the UP Housing Quad was left without power last year following that storm, administrators decided not to take a chance this year.

"Some people say FIU is overreacting … [Even though] we've had much stronger hurricanes in the past. However, we're doing this for the students and we'd rather be safe than sorry," said Joseph Mattachione, director of Office of Residential Life.

Christina Foss, a junior transfer student from Massachusetts currently living at BBC, didn't seem to mind the move as much as others.

"I guess it's necessary. I'm bored and I wish I would've been able to go home," Foss said. "I expected this, it's part of Florida. I figured it would happen and it isn't a big deal."

Housing students have been asked to stay in their respective halls for the last two years. Any Broward or Miami-Dade residents are asked to go home a day before the evacuation.

Denise Sepulveda, a senior, is currently living off-campus. She blames housing's reactions to storms during the hurricane season for her decision not to live on-campus.

 "I lived in housing last semester and there were too many issues during the hurricane so we figured we'd look for an apartment," Suplveda said.

However, like other FIU student living off-campus, Sepulveda joined the pre-Ernesto rush for supplies and gas.

"We didn't think the storm was a big deal until we saw everyone else making a big deal out of it. So we started getting ready buying water, juices and snacks," she said.

Although those left in housing did not have to worry about the supplies rush, students like junior Matthew Gonsalves still felt the evacuation procedure was rushed and uncalled for since many didn't have time to prepare.

"I expected much better from FIU," Gonsalves said. " I never expected them to be that disorganized. I found it extremely strange that they evacuated everyone on very short notice."

Headline: University full of traditions
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
If you've ever seen students religiously spinning the cube sculpture outside Deuxieme Maison during finals week, then you've witnessed one of FIU's several traditions. Since the university opened in 1972, many traditions have been established that promote school spirit. Here's a list of FIU traditions that may help you pass your next exam or hook up with a cute freshman:


The Spinning of the Cube:
"I always spin the cube for good luck, and it always helps me pass my exams," said sophomore Arnold Colina.

For students like Colina, spinning the cube is a ritual performed during the weeks of midterms and finals to ensure passing the exams with a good score. 

According to the Alumni Association website FIUAlumni.com, this tradition is the result of a group of former chemistry students who decided to spin the cube before taking their final exams and subsequently passed them with perfect scores. The same thing happened to the group the following year when they spun the cube. When they failed to spin the sculpture the next semester, however, they all failed the class. 

Some students like Gabriela Duarte, junior, don't see how the cube instills students with the magical ability of passing exams regardless of how little they studied. 

"I don't believe in the cube, but it's a nice tradition to have at the school," Duarte said. "I've been able to pass everything without spinning it."


Stepping on the Seal:
If people tell you not to step on the seal, they aren't talking about the sea animal. They're referring to the university seal, found on the floor of the Graham Center's south entrance and the bookstore's east entrance. 

Stepping on the seal may not seem like a big deal, but you could end up like Javier Lopez, who took nine years to graduate.

The AA website mentions that Javier Lopez planned on graduating early from college. As a freshman, he constantly stepped on the seal. Because of his action, he graduated several years late.

Other students avoid stepping on the seal for alternative reasons.

"I don't step on the seal because stepping on it shows a lack of respect towards the school," said junior Andrea Patino. 


The Kissing Pond:
There is a tradition that is sometimes overlooked: the kissing pond. Found behind the Ryder Business Building, the pond is shaped like a heart and couples often sit around it and kiss. According to the legend, any couple that kissed on the bridge over the pond would be together forever. 

Junior Luis Guerrero frankly expressed his opinion concerning the pond.

"I think it's b------t," Guerrero said. "It's all superstition like those chain letters that curse you for not sending them to 500 people."

Senior Maria Ramirez disagreed.

"I think it's cute and having something like it adds to the university's colorful history," she said. "It's nice to have a light-hearted tradition like that."


Trail of the Torch:
A relatively new addition, the third annual Trail of the Torch celebration is scheduled for Aug. 31 at 7:30 p.m. in the Housing Quad. The event, a candlelight procession from the quad to the Torch of Knowledge outside of GC, started when senior Bryon Tompkins noticed the unlit torch as he walked through campus.

"Three years ago, I saw the torch and thought that a march across campus to light it would be a good idea to welcome everybody to the new semester," said Tompkins. "I got the idea from the Olympics."

After the torch is lit, there will be a foam party between the Blue and Gold Garages, and the FIU-Middle Tennessee game will be broadcasted on a 20-foot screen.

Headline: HURRICANE PARTY!
Subheadline: Students use bad weather as an excuse to celebrate
Author: C. Joel Marino and Xavier Villarmarzo / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
If there's one thing college students are instinctively good at, it's turning the dullest of situations into a party.

Hurricane season should be no exception. With canceled classes and the chance to witness awe-inspiring weather, parties are the best way to keep entertained and beat the dreaded hurricane fatigue.


PARTY PREPARATIONS:
As any normal person should do before a hurricane, your most important stop should be at your local grocery store to buy supplies.

However, you'll probably be doing this the day before the hurricane hits, so the most efficient way to avoid the expected stampedes without having to hire a sherpa is to delve in with a team of at least three friends.

This strategy will help you gather essential supplies quickly while keeping one man stationed at the guaranteed long line.

For those of drinking age, this is also the right time to notice one of the most crucial elements in throwing a hurricane party: the beer aisle is almost always stocked.


DRINKING GAMES:
As a college student, your store raids should include the following items: ping pong balls, a deck of cards and lots and lots of plastic cups.

The chances that the power will remain in tact during and after a storm are slim, so stock up on the alcohol. This may eventually be the only thing keeping you going during the after storm doldrums.

However, drinking games are usually no fun if you find yourself bunking with your parents, little brother or sisters and your aunt Esmeralda.

Make sure you find a large number of friends to shut yourself off from the world with. Just remember, though, you may be stuck in your shelter or house for a long time, so choose people you know won't easily get on your nerves.


BOARD GAMES:
Of course, if you don't want to spend the entire storm drunk, there are other alternatives.

Everyone you know is bound to have at least one board game gathering dust in his or her closets. Make it a party requirement that everyone bring at least one, especially games that take time such as Trivial Pursuit or Monopoly.

Have sharpened pencils and paper ready to go since you won't want to be looking for game supplies by candlelight.

And unlike the previous alternative, this is one activity you probably won't mind doing with your parents and your aunt Esmeralda.


BBQ:
Power outages are unpreventable. However, you can prevent your frozen foods from spoiling while having a great time.

Before the storm hits, it's a smart idea to invite everyone in your neighborhood for a mass cookout of perishable foods.  

Like the board games, have everyone bring their own items: meats, vegetables, cheeses, milk, fruit juices and other foods or drinks that won't last a day without power.

Anything perishable that remains should be grilled no more than 48 hours after the hurricane. This will ensure three days of grand feasting for your entire block.

Regardless of how you decide to spend your time before and during the hurricane, make sure not to do anything stupid like go streaking. Not only will you get blown away or hit by lightning, but you'll miss out on the next hurricane party this season.
