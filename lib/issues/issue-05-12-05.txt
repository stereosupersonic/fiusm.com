Headline: Football team's season not easy to gauge
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With the football program's fourth season coming to and end, it is somewhat complicated to determine if this season, albeit a losing one, was in any way promising for the future.

The win/loss record aside, this season has seen its share of good, bad and even its share of ugly.

Just to recap, here are some positive and negative things  the team has seen this season as of Dec. 1.


The Good:

The 52-6 romp of local rival Florida Atlantic is arguably the best thing to happen to this team. Not only did the Golden Panthers get their first-ever victory over the Fighting Owls, FIU also got an edge in recruiting for this season. If you're a high school recruit teetering between FAU and FIU, the latest result should seal your choice. Would you play for a team on the losing end of a 52-6 final score?

The win at Western Kentucky was also a good sign for the program. It was just three years ago that WKU routed the inaugural FIU football team 56-7. It was also in this victory that FIU showed it could hold on to a late lead Â­- something that has hurt the team in the past.

The win at Louisiana-Monroe was yet another example that showed FIU holding on to a lead and showed that FIU can go toe-to-toe with the best team in the Sun Belt Conference  (at the time). 

The loss against North Texas showed that FIU's defense can hold down a tough rushing attack. The Golden Panthers held the two-headed monster rushing attack of UNT's Patrick Cobbs and Jamario Thomas (the 2003 and 2004 NCAA rushing champion, respectively) to a combined 136.

Finally, this may be a stretch, but the 31-25 loss at Kansas State did show the team they can play up to par with teams from big-time conferences.


The Bad:

The play of junior quarterback Josh Padrick has seen only slight improvement. His touchdown-to-interception ratio and passing yards have remained consistent with his career averages, with only an increase in his completion percentage.

Despite having the number one rated passing offense in the SBC, the offense in general has been inconsistent, especially in the beginning of the season. Untimely turnovers and an inconsistent rushing attack has probably cost FIU a couple of games, most notably the losses against UNT, Arkansas State and Troy. In all of those loses, FIU would have had a legitimate shot of winning had it not been for an anemic running game or a gross amount of turnovers.


The Ugly:

The 56-3 loss at Texas Tech. Not much to say about a 56-3 loss other than it's definitely an ugly. 

The Golden Panthers gained 349 totals yards on offense and 26 first downs, but only scored three points? Blame that on two crucial redzone turnovers.

Another major ugly was the loss at Arkansas State. Not only did the Indians drop 66 points on FIU, they also forced seven turnovers - five by interception and two fumble recoveries.

You can talk about all the good things and the bad things a team has done, but in the end, what matters are wins and losses. There is no scientific way to gauge how good a team really is other than its record.

You can say the FIU football team is better than its record seems to indicate, but that's why football games are played in the first place. 

You can say the team has shown improvement, considering they were a full-time Division I-A member and played a full SBC schedule this season. 

But with the loss of key seniors like Victor Cernius, Nick Turnbull, Lance Preston and Cory McKinney (who has caught a pass in every game in the program's history), it's hard to imagine what this team will be like next year.

I'm not one to make predictions, so I guess we'll all have to wait and see.

Headline: Freshman guard always wanted to be Golden Panther
Author: Cecilia Calvo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the basketball season riding into full gear, The Beacon sat down with one of the newest members of the men's team, freshman Joey Cantens. 

This Miami native attended Miami Christian High School, was ranked No. 49 among the top basketball players in Florida by scout.com and No. 98 on Ed Auricchio's Galaxy of Star's Prep Basketball magazine's list of the Class of 2005's Top 138. 

Cantens also has family ties to playing basketball at FIU. Canten's uncle was a Golden Panther from 1984-1987.

Q: How long have you been playing basketball?

Really, I've been playing basketball since I was a baby. I was about four years-old when I started. My whole family plays basketball. My uncle played basketball here at FIU and my dad's a coach. So it's in my family.

Q: Taking that into consideration, how does it feel to be playing for FIU?

It's good, ever since high school its been my goal to play college ball and I'm finally here. Plus, I think we have a good team and that we're going to do good. I'm happy to be a part of this team, these guys are just great.	

Q: How does it feel to be ranked No. 98 out of 138 players for the Class of 2005?

It's a huge honor, that's all I can say.

Q: How many times does the team practice and how long do the practices usually last?

[Somedays] we have three practices, some days one or two it all depends, but we practice everyday of the week. [Most practices are] an hour and 15 minutes but the longest we've ever gone for is two [hours]. 

Q: What do you do for fun besides playing basketball?

Go to school, because, obviously, I have to keep my GPA up. The team requires a 3.0, but since I did well in high school, [Coach Sergio Rouco] requires a 3.2, so there's lots of studying. But other than that, I just like to hang out and most of the times I'm out with the team. So basically its just those three things: school, study and basketball, that's like my whole life.

Q: When you played for Miami Christian, did you ever think you'd be playing for FIU?

Originally, this is the school I always wanted to go to. I mean, I grew up watching FIU play, so for me to be here is like the best thing in the world for me.

Headline: Rouco's team wins two straight
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's basketball team took care of business against Division II Florida Tech (2-3) with a 72-54 win Dec. 1 at Pharmed Arena, The Golden Panthers improve their record to 3-2 in what could have been a trap game following the 69-64 upset win over South Florida Nov. 29.

The win marked the tenth straight against the Florida Tech Panthers, pushing FIU's all-time record against them to 10-0 all-time. 

"We were not going to overlook this team," said head coach Sergio Rouco. "We tried our best to come out with intensity and we did." 

Senior Ivan Almonte continued his dominant play, running his streak of consecutive double-doubles to five with a 23-point, 17-rebound performance which tied a career high set earlier in the week against USF. 

The senior is currently second in the nation behind Justin Williams of Wyoming in rebounds per game at 14.4. 

Chris Fuller and Kenny Simms joined the team captain in double figures. 

Fuller added 14 points, eight of which came from the free throw line, while his sophomore classmate Simms, who had a career night against the Panthers last year at Pharmed Arena, poured in 12 points and nine rebounds as the inside game was open all night for coach Rouco's men. 

The match-up was plagued by bad plays, especially in the first half, as neither team could really get anything going. FIU pulled away right before the half to head into the locker room up 21, 41-20. 

Florida Tech kept their heads up in the second half. Led by 17 points from Titas Vainauskas and 12 from E.J. Murray, they outscored FIU in the second session 34-31.

Poor shooting and untimely shots were the difference as Florida Tech managed to shoot just 31 percent on the night including a dismal 21 percent in the first half. 

The host Golden Panthers led by as many as 29 in the second half before three-point field goals from Murray and back court partner Desmond Greene kept the visiting Panthers in the game; they combined for seven tries on the night. 

The Golden Panthers were without the services of Ismael N'Diaye as the senior was ruled out with a sprained wrist after picking up the injury in the two-overtime win over USF. His status is day-to-day and is looking for a possible return at George Washington. 

FIU now takes to the road as they embark on their toughest road test of the season.

"We have a tough task," Rouco said. "We want to play better teams; we want to get ready for the conference. This is not going to make or break our season; [after all] we have been on this pony ride before. Players like Ivan [Almonte] came to FIU to play the big schools, not the Florida Techs." 

Games against the likes of No. 19 George Washington (Dec. 8), Notre Dame (Dec. 10), No. 13 Michigan State (Dec. 18) and La Salle (Dec. 20) are in store for this team over the next three weeks before returning home to face St. Bonaventure in the annual FIU Holiday Classic Dec. 27.  

  "We are not going to GW to see monuments; we are going to play basketball," a smiling Rouco said, following the win. 



FIU 69 USF 64



It took two overtimes but the Golden Panthers got the job done. 

FIU pushed their home record this year to 2-0 with a stunning run of play late in the second half and overtime to stun visitor USF (2-1) 69-64 at Pharmed Arena, Nov. 29.

"That was a big win," Rouco said, following the second overtime. "That's a real tough team. I was brought here to win games like this ... to take this team to another level and hopefully that's what we're going to do."

Coming into the game FIU was just 1-11 all-time against their cross-state rival, not having won since 1989. 

Led by Johwen Villegas, who scored a team high 17 points, and senior captain Almonte, who added yet another double-double with 15 points and a career-high 17 rebounds, the Golden Panthers rallied late in the second half eclipsing an 11 point deficit on a 19-8 run. 

Down by three, 54-51, with just eight seconds left to play in regulation, Rouco called on freshman Elvis Lora to take the shot. Lora nailed it from two feet behind the three-point line to send the contest into overtime, tied at 54. 

"He is fearless," Rouco said. "Sometimes you don't want to put the ball in an older guy's hands because he puts too much pressure on himself. Younger guys just play; they don't have any pressure on themselves."

Lora would nail his second three of the game during the first overtime for his only six points of the night, handing the host Golden Panthers a 57-56 with 3:05 left to play in the first extra session. 

FIU extended their lead to 60-58, but with 1.4 seconds left in overtime, South Florida guard Chris Capko, who had played through a shoulder injury that was re-aggravated in the second half, came up with a clutch-running jumper in the lane to send the game to a second overtime.

As the crowd got into the game, so did Rouco's men. The Golden Panthers would take the lead 63-60 in that last extra session as Almonte found a wide open Villegas for his fourth try of the night from the corner.  

The lead was extended to 67-64 before the Bulls got the ball back with 29 seconds left to play. Collin Dennis, who had played limited minutes all night long, missed a poor three-point attempt. Almonte ripped down his final rebound and threw it the length of the court to find a streaking N'Diaye, who finished a rather quiet night with a smashing dunk as time expired.  

"This is such a big win over a Big East team," Almonte said as the crowd began to quiet down. "We just kept playing hard all night and never gave up."

Subheadline: Religious expressions suppressed
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
From the Terri Schiavo case in the spring to the ongoing battle over the teaching of intelligent design in the classroom, this year has been highlighted by controversies regarding the role and influence of religion or religious-tinged ideas not just within the government, but within American society itself.

The debate has now managed to spill over to the final days of the year as politicians, store retailers, special interest groups and even school boards grapple with yet another conflict: Should the use of the word "Christmas" be eliminated from common usage because of its religious overtones, replaced instead with the more generic "holidays?"

Just the fact that this argument has even been raised is ridiculous. 

Though past cases have made headway in further defining the separation of church and state in America (such as Supreme Court rulings in the '80s which allowed the display of festivity icons in government spaces as long as they didn't cater to specific belief systems), this season's upheaval borders on the petty.

The most comical debate, however, seems to be the renaming of the Christmas tree into the neutral "holiday tree," a switch being made by city councils and school boards across the country.

Although the evergreen icon of the season has over the years become more of a secular than religious symbol, changing the tree's name could still be seen as nothing but a move of cultural ignorance as those inclined to political correctness forget the fact that, though the tree is indeed lighted in the holiday season, it is not a tradition within all of those holidays.

Any child studying in today's public school systems can tell that the paper cut-outs littering classroom walls each have a specific meaning: The star of David and menorahs are for Hannukah; the multi-colored candles are for Kwanzaa and the star-topped trees are for Christmas. 

If the name of the trees are changed to embrace those people who do not celebrate Christmas, should the other figures then be renamed the star of holiday or the holiday candles?

Most of the people putting up trees this year will either be Christians or those raised within Christian traditions. 

Though the history of the Christmas tree proves that the symbol is originally far from Christian, the followers of that faith have adopted it as a cherished representation of one of their holiest days and no politically correct politician, high school teacher or commercializing factor will ever be able to detatch one from the other.

Such signs of the season as the eponymous tree and the simple wishing of a "Merry Christmas," if not taken for the religious significance they carry, should at least be regarded as a reminder of the good cheer and hope that are generally promoted at this time.

Headline: Obstructive construction benefits future generations
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
You see it as you drive on to campus. It's the sight and sound of renovation and expansion.  

It's been going on for quite some time now.  Most people (like me) are already used to it.  

I don't mind the construction at all.  

Yes, it can mean more struggling for parking, and yes, it can mean more places being closed off with "work in progress" signs accompanied by yellow caution tape.  

However, the future is always going to be a "work in progress."

The master plan for expanding the university has been updated every five years.  

Right now, current building plans include: A marine biology building, a microbiology building, the Lakeview dorms, the law building that's currently under way, a new business building and two more parking garages. On top of new facilities, renovations to the current facilities are in order.  

Ballroom expansion in the Graham Center is currently pending approval. The third floor of GC is being updated to fire codes and will be open by the new year, which will mean the re-opening of the Porter Davis Game Room.  At the same time, the Rathskeller area, which includes the Game Room and Gracie's Grill, could be seeing possible renovation.

According to James Waasenaar, executive director of Student Affairs, the Lakeview dorms will cost about $40 million. On top of costs, construction is currently one month behind due to the recent storm activity of this past hurricane season.

I've been attending FIU for quite some time and I've watched the construction come and go. I saw the closing of the GC Pit for the addition of windows and I still miss the Game Room. I can still remember the times I spent in the GC computer lab when it was moved to the second floor and most of GC was closed off.  

I even remember the food court before the Fresh Food cafeteria was built. For me, the construction is an afterthought. For the most part, the new additions I've seen in my time here have been great to everyone so far.  

The expansions haven't taken away from the central pub for FIU students. I enjoy the new GC computer lab and the cafeteria. 

The only problem I've seen with everything going on is parking.  

Right now, parking in the dorms for housing students is rather scant and for off-campus students, it can be a big hassle. Almost everyday, I see cars parked illegally or people waiting in their cars parked by the elevators and stairs of the garages, waiting for someone to come out so they can take their spot; I myself am one of those people.  

I think that the two new garages planned will help ease some of the parking hassles that most commuters face.  

Like most of the construction, it will take time, but parking will be better off in the long run.

Personally, I understand why people complain about all the construction going on, but I think it is fine to further expand the campus with facilities that will see much use and attract more students.  

There is always some kind of renovation going on in any kind of establishment and FIU is no different.  

I do think that (and I'm sure that others feel the same way) it would be nice if we are kept informed of any new plans on campus expansion/renovation in order to give feedback and better assess what is necessary and what could be done.

While there are some downsides to all the construction going on right now, it is good to know that it will be benefiting future students in the long run.  

It is important to remember that things like expansion take time.

Headline: The Evolutionary War ~ Part 2
Subheadline: Only evolution should be taught in biology classes  
Author: Adrian Diaz / Assistant Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
I grew up in a rational family. That is, they instilled in me the idea that everything could be solved through scientific reasoning and logic. Needless to say, I grew up firmly believing in evolutionary theory.

Intelligent design has not been espoused to me at any point in my educational career, and I am thankful for its absence. Some believe intelligent design must be taught in biology classrooms in order to give students a broader perspective on humans. Intelligent design is unfit for teaching in public schools.

The teaching of intelligent design is inherently religious. 

There is no viable scientific evidence to support this Dogma and, while I have no problem with anyone believing in Intelligent design, I do have qualms when someone tries to teach it as science. 

You cannot make something fact by believing in it very strongly. Richard Dawkins, who is the holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair in the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford said, "Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence."

The problem with intelligent design is that the proponents of the theory are protecting a core belief value and will skew facts to fit that belief, while evolution is a theory that was first presented by a man who, when young, wanted to become part of the priesthood. 

When this point is brought up to most creationists, they usually make the accusation that one has a scientific bias, or as I call it: reason. The belief that an all-knowing, all-powerful creator compiled all the intricacies of the natural world and made it function as we know it today is a philosophical belief and not a scientific one. If we allow intelligent design to be taught in schools, and call it science, then we can teach the Bible and call it natural history. 

The people who believe in intelligent design frequently use the argument that evolution also is just a theory. This is a sneaky semantic trick. A scientific theory is composed of facts and has been proven over and over again through testing, and has been published to the scrutiny of other scientists. A theory, in scientific parlance, does not have the same connotation as when a lay person uses it; that is "conjecture" or "guess." They also attempt to argue, that evolution is a controversial theory among scientists. 

This is a manipulative lie. There is no dissension among any reasonable real scientists about evolution. The American Association of University Professors believes, "The theory of evolution is all but universally accepted in the community of scholars and has contributed immeasurably to our understanding of the natural world." The only conflict remaining in the scientific community, which explains why it is called a theory, is the specific mechanisms of evolution and not whether evolution itself is true or not.

In the end, what one believes on this issue comes down to personal choice. Nothing published will change anyone's view on this topic one way or the other.

However, it should not be taught in schools solely by virtue of it being something that some people believe. 

If we accept the criteria that some have put forth for teaching intelligent design, then we could use it to teach virtually anything in school.

Headline: Aramark upgrades cafeteria
Author: Liza Olsen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With eye-catching signs and a wider selection of food, food services at the Biscayne Bay Campus have changed. 

"It's more attractive, colorful and stands out more," said Liv Lejdurandth, a hospitality and management graduate student. 

The university has installed new signs at Grille Works and Home Zone. They are also catering more toward Caribbean students. 

Roger Clegg, director of operations, has worked at University Park for the past two years and at BBC since the beginning of the Fall semester. Although this project took place during the last three weeks of the Summer semester, it did not disrupt students or faculty, according to Clegg.

"It was definitely a short-term remodeling project; certain sections that were being worked on were roped off in order to keep some parts of the facility available to the students and faculty," Clegg said. "The changes occurred because the cafeteria needed a face lift."

The renewed relationship between FIU and Aramark took place last August and has heightened the university's standards.

"We wanted to introduce higher quality foods that were still affordable to its consumers," Clegg said. 

The quick-stop coffee shop, located on the first floor of Academic I, is an example of the upgrade in food services. Not only has the menu been renewed, but the coffee shop's name was also changed from The Oasis to Express. Instead of just bagels and muffins, the shop is now serving Caesar wraps and fruit salads, which offer students and staff a healthier choice.

"I love the new fruit bowls; those are my favorite," said Sandra Levy, a sophomore majoring in public relations. 

According to Clegg, Aramark hired committees such as Auxiliary Services to host surveys concerning the different kinds of food that students preferred, 

The committees handed out surveys during Spring of 2005. 

"They asked me where I would like to see changes made and what time I usually eat there," said Armando Barretto, a senior majoring in public relations.  

But, flashy new signs and a healthier menu are just the beginning, according to Lemar Linton, vice-president of the Student Government Association.

"Aramark is looking to expand within a year and a half, as part of the renovation to BBC. We have hopes for making the [Wolfe University Center] like the Fresh Food Company at [the] UP campus," Linton said.

Although efforts to improve food services are still in the works, students like Adam Barkan aren't impressed. 

"It still doesn't really have anything that appeals to me," said Barkan, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism.

Headline: Cookbook provides diverse recipes
Author: Karen Buitrago / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Start sizzling your pans and heat up your grill with the help of the FIU cookbook, "Get Cookin' with Faculty and Staff of Florida International University." Learn and practice while making diverse dishes for family and friends.

The cookbook is the second compilation of different recipes from the university's faculty and staff. It has interesting dishes, such as Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Coca-Cola Brisket, Tiramisu, Easy Microwavable Pineapple Upside-Down Cake and Ropa Vieja.

According to Sylvia Sharpe, chair of the University Support Personnel System, the cookbook is a diverse combination of family recipes and recipes from famous restaurants.

"[The recipes] could be described as family recipes passed down from one generation to the next. There are dishes from famous restaurants, such as Mark's Place in Fort Lauderdale. Also, the recipes are for all occasions from tailgate parties to formal dinners, international fare and recipes for the health conscious," Sharpe said.

Original founder Elaine Dillashaw, who recently retired, came up with the idea of making a cookbook as a way to raise funds for the USPS Senate.

Along with her creative idea of raising funds she left behind a collection of her own recipes like Tex-Mex Dip, Low Carb Cheesecake and Old Fashioned Peach Cobbler.

"Proceeds [of the cookbook] will go to into the USPS Senate Scholarship fund. When we have enough money in the fund, a scholarship committee is formed and applications are distributed to those USPS personnel who are pursuing their education," Sharpe said.

The cookbook contains 318 recipes manageable even to the busiest student. For example, the book has a recipe for Gramma cookies with a few steps and in less than 25 minutes. Also, it has cleverly named sections that will draw the attention of interested browsers. A number of these sections are fun food for kids, everybody's favorites, definitely dessert and super soups and scrumptious salads.

Kathy Hasselbach, office assistant for the Department of International Relations, worked on the first cookbook in 1997.

She also served on the original committee that compiled the cookbook's second edition.

"We developed the cookbook because it contained favorite recipes of the faculty and staff. Most of the recipes were made and brought to department parties. So, it has great food recipes and wonderful memories," Hasselbach said.

The authors of the cookbook are the members of the committee that put together the cookbook and those members of faculty and staff from Biscayne Bay Campus and University Park who contributed their own recipes, according to Sharpe.

Hedy First, administrative assistant of the faculty senate at the University Park campus, submitted a recepie for Chinese Chicken Salad, among others.

"Most of the recipes are easy. Students can learn and practice ...  this is a local cookbook, compiled by the FIU community. There is no other like it in the world," First said.

Hasselbach added her share of enthusiasm from the responses she is getting for her entries.

"I have many recipes in the cookbook. Two of the favorites I entered are German Chocolate Cake and Apple Crumb Pie," Hasselbach said.

She said the cookbook has been promoted in the university announcements and in an article in the President's Newsletter published two months ago.

Still, not enough students know that an FIU cookbook exists and much less that they can purchase it at the university bookstores. While some students admitted that the book needed more advertising others, like Susan Jill Cooper, were excited.

"I'm pleased that we have a cookbook that covers everything form appetizers to main dishes to vegetables," said Cooper, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism.

Some students are willing to buy the cookbook to satisfy their curiosity.

"I would probably buy one just to see what's in it," said Erick Abreu, a junior majoring in biology.

The cost of the cookbook is $10; it can be found at the FIU bookstores.

"[It's] an inexpensive cookbook, an excellent holiday, birthday or graduation gift," Sharpe said.

Headline: Secret society inducts university student leaders
Author: Jennifer Mesa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On the evening of Nov. 28 at the Omni Colonnade in Coral Gables, members of the FIU community were initiated into Order of the Torch, a prestigious honorary society. 

Potential members are nominated by a secret vote, and the invitations to the society are given at random times as an honorary surprise.  

"You could be just walking down the hall or going to the bathroom, and then someone just hands you an invitation," said Drigo Duarte, a senior and member of Order of the Torch since the Fall of 2004.  

Duarte has been president of Sigma Phi Epsilon, previous president and vice president of the Inter-Fraternity Council, and vice president of Delta Epsilon Pi.  

This secret organization honors active leaders, such as students or alumni who have excelled in a variety of areas on campus "to create a body of one," said Christine Denton, vice-president for the Student Government Association and a member of Order of the Torch.   

This organization was founded by Omar Castillo McIntosh, Sanjay Dhawan, Clayton Solomon, Marlon Font and Sean Kramer in the Fall of 2003. 

Its members are initiated every Fall and Spring semesters.  

Currently, the Order has a cap of 30 members, although there is no minimum amount of members required.  

Instead, the society "focuses on the quality of our members' leadership, professionalism and character," said Mariela Campuzano, president of the Order of the Torch.  "We do not focus our efforts on quantity."

Although the Order of the Torch is unique to FIU, other universities have similar clubs which honor the same attributes.  

The organization can be compared to other secret honorary societies at other universities, such as University of Miami's Iron Arrow, Florida State University's Burning Spears or the University of Florida's Blue Key.  

In addition, FIU's Order of the Torch offers various benefits to its members such as, "networking among FIU's respected alumni, having a voice in FIU traditions and developing professionalism," Campuzano said. 

This society is truly honorary, as individuals must be nominated by current members, faculty or advisors of the organization in order to be considered for membership. 

However, there is no application process or specific requirements needed to become a member, which is one of the reasons why membership is so prestigious.  

"There is not one specific mold that one must meet in order to be considered a member," said Denton, who was among the first class of members to be initiated.  

Randy Mora is among the newly initiated inductees for this Fall semester.   

Mora happily accepted this honor that he acknowledged "is a distinction reserved for a selected few."  

Having been involved in Student Government Association, a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, a previous peer advisor  and an alumni of the Academy of Leaders, among other things, Mora agrees that meeting certain qualifications is not what makes one worthy of membership.  

More importantly, members are looked upon for "what they have done with the leadership that has been bestowed upon them."

Members range in involvement and include Greeks, athletes, student government members, grad students, alumni and many more.  

Most importantly, potential members are assessed according to their "contributions and positive impact on the institution and the local community," Campuzano said.  

In turn, active members of the order give back to FIU through service and through various events.  

For example, the order is currently planning on moving the FIU torch to the Betty Chapman plaza as a gift to the  class of 2006.  

The Student Government Association has already agreed to pay for the gas needed to fuel the torch.

"Every other organization on campus requires that you apply to be admitted, but with this one, you have to have made a significant contribution of service to our FIU community, and [you] are recognized as a result of that," Denton said. "These students are FIU's shinning stars, to say the least."

Headline: Jones adds comedy to classroom
Author: Luisa Cabrera / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Jean Jones looks like Bill Clinton, and he does a great impression, but the bowling shirt he wears says "Mike."

In the small portable that houses his introductory English class, Jones makes faces, does voices and makes his students laugh while teaching literature.

"I learned a long time ago that my vehicle for learning was humor. I tried to be firm, but I thought it would be better if students enjoyed the class. They would learn more," Jones said.

Jones's  class, however, is not an easy one. Students may use unconventional methods for learning, but they are expected to learn.  One activity designed to expand their vocabulary skills is called "1,2,3 .... Action." Jones writes several difficult vocabulary words on the board and makes students act them out in groups. 

The students have a good laugh, but the method helps them remember words like "deuz ex machina."  

As students act out their skits, Jones stands at the back of the class cracking jokes and trying to guess the word his students are describing.  Sometimes he joins the skits, using all his improv-comedy tricks for the sake of education.

"If I weren't teaching, I'd be doing stand-up," Jones said.

Jones follows the teaching methods of Howard Gardner, a psychologist based at Harvard University, best known for his concept of "multiple intelligences," which states that there are many ways in which a human being learns, and each way should be explored.

"I feel like I actually learn in this class. He has the best way of teaching; he's humorous, lively and he can't bore you - you want to come to class," said Maheen Moughal, a biology major in Jones's class. 

Jones has been teaching at FIU for five years and at Coral Park Senior High School for six. He studied English literature at Northwest Missouri State University, and his southern drawl is still slightly present.

Jones's ratings are extremely high on www.ratemyprofessors.com his students at Coral Park have the highest Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test scores in their school and his classes for next semester are already full at FIU.  When he's not teaching, Jones collects Jade jewelry, bowling shirts with other peoples' name and is a professional metal detector. 

"I am definitely unorthodox," Jones said.

Jones comes from a family of teachers; his father was a professor at NMU, where he was known for wild antics in the classroom and a personal teaching method.  

Jones is more subtle. 

"I hope my students will be better writers, readers and regain their lust for learning. Kids don't all learn the same way; everyone has something they're good at," Jones said.

When Jones asked how many of his students would be returning to him for ENC 1102, every arm in the class shot up. In his ENC 1102 class, Jones does readings of Shakespeare and Steinbeck. In order to ensure that his students understand the context of the novels, he takes on character roles and engages in lively discussions about the books.

"His 1102 class is more literature, and he says it's his passion, so I'm really interested in seeing how he does it.  If he is more passionate about that class than the one I am in now, I can't wait," said Jessica Rodriguez, who's majoring in journalism. The classmates definitely feel a sense of cohesion. 

"It is the esprit de corps," Jones said, "That means 'The spirit of the group. It is how we relate, the dynamic in the class."

Jones's way of getting students involved with hand motions, class discussions and humor has definitely paid off.   

"How bad can it be to have joy in a classroom?" Jones said. "I try to find a way to get students to want to use what they learn in the classroom in the outside world, and the secret is that I teach what I really enjoy."

Headline: Museum on wheels  brings Latin culture
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As tables with shining silver platters layed between the street and sidewalk, a big bus pulled into the parking lot at Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Students walked by with curious looks on their faces. Some of them stopped in their tracks. 

There'd be no reason for them to find the presence of a bus unusual the afternoon Nov. 22. After all, buses are practically an extra limb of FIU, considering the regular visits of bloodmobiles and the hourly circulation of shuttles. But this was definitely not seen on campus before. 

"If people can't go to the museum, the museum will come to the people," said an inscription on the distinct-looking bus.

An art exhibit had just rolled into BBC. 

It came from the PIAG Museum in Coral Gables and it's called, fittingly, the PIAG Museum on Wheels. 

The bus doors opened to reveal a mix of artwork from several Latin countries, including Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela, Panama, Cuba, Mexico, Costa Rica and Spain. There were a total of 11 paintings and two sculptures. 

One painting was made on silk and featured many eyes peeking out of trees. 

"I paint eyes all the time," said Colombian painter Pilar Rocha, who was looking after her ocular-themed brainchild. "This is the best way to express feelings - you cannot lie with your eyes. Here, the trees are watching you - you have to protect nature the way you protect people."

Outside in the silver platters, free food and fruit punch awaited visitors. 

Before going for the food, freshman Valerie Soued - one of the estimated 117 visitors to the bus that day - said she was pleased about the exhibit.

"I like art," Soued said. "I like it even more because it's Hispanic art, my heritage. They should come more." 

The art-driven initiative came to life last May, when Miami-Dade County Commission Chairman Joe A. Martinez held a ceremony at the PIAG Museum to unleash its mobile version. The chairman's official website, www.piagmuseum.com, calls the South Floridian advent of the moving museum "art history."

"The goal of the museum is to bring the arts closer to residents and to provide direct contact between art lovers and art historians, curators, researchers and photographers, among others," the website says. 

PIAG President Mireya Power, who also had a couple of paintings in mobile display, said Martinez convinced the Miami-Dade Transit Department to donate the bus for their project. 

The idea to bring the bus to FIU came within a few months, she said, when she met a university representative at a Chamber of Commerce event that drew together people from Power's native Venezuela. 

The FIU representative was Vivian Perez, assistant director of marketing for BBC's Wolfe University Center. Perez, who's originally from Puerto Rico, said she attends all sorts of business events. 

As the bus made an afternoon-long stop at BBC, Perez ran back and forth. 

She was in charge of organizing and overseeing the cultural project. 

"It's different from everything else we do here," Perez said.

She said her department has been trying to get current and former students interested in activities at Wolfe University Center. 

The center's theme this year is Chart Your Own Path, she said, and it has hosted monthly activities ranging from a career day for students who work at FIU to a "speed-networking" event for alumni.

Nov. 22 was Culture Appreciation Day. Perez said FIU paid around $350 to bring in the mobile museum - close to the price of the catering. 

"This gives students a taste in terms of international food as well as international art," Perez said, pointing to the croquettes, meatballs and egg rolls on the platters. 

Greg Olson, director for Student Affairs at BBC, was one of the people who walked by the PIAG bus bearing an interested look that afternoon. 

He said he considered the Museum on Wheels a good awareness effort for the community. 

"In this area we live in, and at FIU, we have a diverse culture," Olson said. "This is a way to get in touch with different cultural expressions."

Subheadline: Maximizing potential for daily caloric expenditure
Author: Edwin Ryan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In order to effectively apply strategies that will assist with fat loss, one topic that must be stressed is that of consuming only low-fat products. In the United States there is an increase of low-fat and non-fat foods on grocery store shelves. 

Unfortunately, there are also more overweight people in the U.S. than ever before. 

Some physicians agree, the problem is that the health and fitness industry has unconsciously sent the message that total calorie consumption is not important if your diet is low in fat. 

As a result, many people begin to think  if they eat low fat, they can eat as much as they want without gaining weight. 

However, if you take in more calories than you use, you'll add fat pounds. It is also believed that when  you eat low-fat foods and non-fat foods, you  may be bypassing a bodily cue which tells you when  you've had enough to eat. 

That cue comes from an intestinal hormone called cholecystokinin, which gets release when less fat is consumed. The release of cholecystokinin slows gastric emptying, which in turn decreases appetite and increases feelings of fullness. 

I am not recommending that people avoid low-fat/low-calorie foods, but rather, that people should become more aware of the serving size on the nutrition label and understand that too much of any low-fat or low calorie food would increase total calorie consumption and impede fat loss efforts. Below is a list of useful strategies one should employ for weight management.


Exercise Regularly:

Exercising regularly helps regulate  food intake. When you don't exercise, your body is less sensitive to its own internal regulatory system. Therefore, signals of hunger and feelings of fullness aren't as sharp. 

As a result, your eating patterns, as well as your body weight, tend to fluctuate more. It is well known that caloric expenditure increases during exercise. 

However, this increase in energy expenditure may continue after exercise as well. For up to 24 hours after an intense workout, your resting metabolic rate increases above normal. 

This may result in expending anywhere from 50 to a few hundred more calories. While this may not sound like much, it adds up. This increase caloric expenditure adds up and  plays a key role in assisting you with your weight loss efforts. 

Additionally, resistance training with free weights and/or machines would increase your lean body mass, which will increase your metabolic rate. 

This is possible because muscle tissue requires more calorie energy than fat tissue, since it is denser compared to fat.


Increase your physical activity:

Physical activity may be defined as any bodily movement which results in caloric expenditure. 

Exercise is planned physical activity that improves one or more of the components of fitness muscular fitness, flexibility, cardiorespiratory endurance or body composition.  

By parking your car further, taking the stairs, washing your car or any other daily chore that requires the use of large muscles, you will positively impact your caloric expenditure. A person may expend as many as 300 calories daily by simply increasing their level of physical activity.  


Eat often:

In a study of lean women, 75 percent reported eating at least four times per day. 

People who struggle with unwanted pounds often skip meals in an effort to control their weight. There is now strong evidence that consuming regular meals and in some instances four to six meals a day may actually increase daily caloric expenditure and prevent your metabolism from slowing down. 

Eating within 30 minutes of exercise may also boost calorie burning.  As you already know, your body burns extra calories after you workout, and since your resting metabolic rate increases immediately after you eat, the addition of a meal may boost caloric expenditure. 

As we approach the holiday season with the temptation for overeating and drinking, I urge you to keep the above points in mind and control your portion size. If for some reason you forget these points during this year's festivities, just remember: easy on your lips or forever on your hips.

Headline: Xbox craze leaves fans empty-handed
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Consumers lined up at electronic stores nationwide on Nov. 22 to get their hands on Microsoft's latest video game console, the Xbox 360. Officially released at 12:01 a.m., the console quickly flew off store shelves and many shoppers, including some who pre-ordered the system, were left empty-handed. "Sold Out" signs appeared almost instantly after stores opened, and sales associates turned away many customers at the register. 

The mass shortages are not surprising. Places such as Wal-Mart and Target only received between  three to 50 units per store for the Nov. 22 release date. Other chains such as GameStop and EB Games received only enough units to fulfill pre-orders. As a result, many people who waited for several hours in line ended up wasting their time.

Although many empty-handed gamers are upset at supply problems, Xbox 360 owners are facing problems as well. 

According to gaming website 1Up.com, several players have reported crashes and freezes during games such as Perfect Dark Zero and Project Gotham Racing 3. One player experienced a crash after only 20 minutes of play, and another gamer was unable to turn off his system. The console's accessories have also caused some gamers grief. Several people have cited problems with the system's controllers and with headsets being unresponsive.   

Microsoft spokeswoman Molly O' Donnell spoke with Reuters and confirmed the existence of defective consoles. 

"We have received a few isolated reports of consoles not working as expected," O' Donnell said. 

Some gamers, such as freshman Arnold Colina, believe Microsoft made a mistake by rushing the console's release to take advantage of the holiday season. 

"I think Microsoft hurried the console's development to meet holiday demand and failed to ensure that all its glitches were ironed out," Colina said.  

Microsoft's Xbox 360 is not the first gaming console to be plagued by problems at initial release. Similar problems were reported when the original Xbox was released in 2001. Also, manufacturing problems affected the Sony PlayStation 2 launch in 2001 by limiting shipments to stores. 

Regardless, the Xbox 360 shortage has not deterred determined fans from obtaining the new console. Consumers are looking to buy the item through any means necessary, especially via the Internet. Auction websites such as eBay.com and Ubid.com have plenty of Xbox 360s for sale, but consumers have to pay excessively more than the retail price to get one.

Auction prices for the new console have reached as high as $4,500, more than fifteen times the $299 core system's retail price. Most of the systems, however, are being sold in the $500-$1500 range. 

Sophomore Gabriel Correa does not understand why people should spend so much money on a video game console. 

"I find it ridiculous that people get so hyped up that they pay absurd prices for things such as video games. It's amazing how much influence advertisement can have on consumers," Correa said. 

Since the Xbox 360's release coincides with the holiday season, the system has a formidable advantage over competitors Sony and Nintendo. When both release their next-generation consoles next year, the Xbox 360 will have already established its presence in gamers' homes. 

Both companies expect to release their respective systems by mid-to-late 2006, but rumors have been rampant about a Sony PlayStation 3 delay into 2007. 

This past August, industry analyst team Wedbush Morgan Securities published a memo stating that Sony could strategically delay its console until 2007 if the Xbox 360 fared poorly at launch. This scenario, however, is now unlikely because most, if not all, stores nationwide have sold out of their Xbox 360s.

Despite console shortages and hardware problems, Microsoft's Xbox 360 launch has proven successful. Lucky gamers are experiencing a whole new level of gaming and the less fortunate will have the same pleasure next year when new shipments arrive in stores. 

Nevertheless, the Xbox 360's release should teach Microsoft not to repeat the same mistakes in the future.

Headline: "Museum without Walls"
Subheadline: Outdoor sculpture museum worth more than passing glance   
Author: Luisa Cabrera / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Martin Z. Margulies Sculpture Park can be seen everywhere on campus, yet many students have never heard it mentioned. The park is an unintentional collection of sculptures that began in the mid-90s when William Tucker, a renowned sculptor, loaned the first piece to FIU's Frost Art Museum for display on the University Park campus. Known as "The Rim," his sculpture began a collection of art that Martin Margulies loaned to FIU.

While the park is affiliated with the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum, it is not owned by the museum.  

The park currently consists of over 100 sculptures; some located at UP campus, and a few found at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

According to Chip Steely, director of the Martin Z. Margulies Sculpture Park, the collection is worth 11 million to 15 million dollars - an estimate 10,000 to 800,000 dollars a piece. 

"It's a museum without walls, and that is the beautiful thing about it. We are one of the few public universities that house artwork on display for students to see in the outdoors. We are very fortunate to have it," said Stacey De La Grana, acting director for the Frost Art Museum. 

Besides providing an aesthetic benefit to FIU, one particular sculpture has served as a tool for good luck. Tony Rosenthal's "Marty's Cube," located in front of the building Deuxieme Maison, is mounted on a rotating axis. Tradition calls for students to spin the cube before an exam so that they receive a good grade. 

"For my differential educations class, I spined the cube and it worked," said Carlos Belliard, who is majoring in civil engineering. "I passed my test."

The FIU community is glad to preserve its existing collection.

This year, it has endured its fair share of trials. Some might think the hurricanes that have passed through Miami have left the greatest impact on the sculptures. However, it is the students who have damaged the artwork. 

"People are skating on the sculptures, disrespecting the artwork and damaging it beyond repair. Many pieces have large chunks missing, scratches and scuffs,"   Steely said. "The biggest obstacle in preservation is the student body and trying to generate respect for the artwork. It being loaned, we're honored to have it here. We don't want to lose the privilege by damaging the artist's work."

However, other factors preserve the sculptures. Perhaps the most well known sculpture, located at the traffic circle near the 16 Street entrance, "The Lieberman," is being re-painted this year due to weather and sun damage.

Along with concerns of preservation, plans are underway to add to the already extensive collection.

On Dec. 4, FIU hosted artist Jenny Holzer in coalition with Art Basel. The yearly "Breakfast in the Park" series offers the opportunity to over 400 people to speak with artists, take tours of  the park and visit the Frost Art Museum.

Holzer is a conceptual artist who added a sculpture to the park. The sculpture, called "Selections From Truisms," displays several truisms as it scrolls electronically. Phrases such as "Confusing yourself is a way to stay honest," blink across the screen for viewers to ponder.

Holzer's truisms have been displayed in unique places such as billboards, t-shirts, telephone booths and airports. They have been translated into several languages, and have made her a celebrated artist.  

The Frost Art Museum is hoping to keep Holzer's work on campus, but is still working to find a location for it. 

Tours of  the park can be scheduled for groups of 10 or more by calling the Frost Art Museum at 305-348-3892.

GET vs Evolution and Intelligent Design

Dover,Pa. is just the beginning!  The legal decision resulting from this court action will have a long term effect on what schools teach future generations about the history of Mankind's creation.

Genetically Engineered Theory (GET) is the provable explanation of the history of Mankind's creation. 

By using genetic engineering to adapt to the requirements of long-distance space flight, our scientists will be able to create our spacemen with stronger bones, more efficient lungs, protection from radiation, and longer life, Dr. Cynthia Kenyon asserts that our longevity gene can be manipulated to give our spacemen 500 years of life and the ability to hibernate.

GET, Genetically Engineered Theory, is a third explanation of the origin of, specifically, the human species and human nature.  It is a comprehensive explanatory paradigm of the scientific, genetic, creation of the human species.  

The Genetically Engineered Theory corrects and subsumes both the Creationist and the Darwinian paradigms, demonstrating clearly and conclusively that they are both half right and half wrong: there was an initiating creation of the human species by a "god" but it was a process of genetic engineering; there is an obvious process of developmental, adaptive evolution on this planet but the human species, specifically, came into being through a deliberate, pragmatic decision and action by the Anunnaki, the alien species who, as elucidated by voluminous historical documentation, genetically engineered the human species.

The background information and rationale for the GET paradigm comes from both the ancient scriptures (Sumerian through Hebrew) as does the Creationist paradigm and from science (archaeology, history, biology, astronomy, paleontology, linguistics) as does the basis of the Darwinian evolutionary paradigm. A detailed presentation of the background material is primarily found in the Nobel prize quality work of the Sumerian scholar, Zecharia Sitchin. 

GET does not seek to disprove either the Creationist /ID or the Darwinian paradigms. It advances an entirely different interpretation of the archaeological and historical information which is robust enough to not only correct but radically reinterpret and subsume both previous paradigms, set them in historical perspective, and show them to be finally superseded, thereby opening the way to a planetary, consensual, definition of the generically human, leading to planetary species unity and peace, the essential condition for acceptance and matriculation into stellar society.
