Subheadline: Sleep deprivation yields negative long-term consequences
Author: Yalexa Leon / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Is it possible that weak brain activity, weight gain, more than 30 percent of large truck accidents and a faster aging process can all be caused by the same factor? The answer is yes and it affects a great amount of college students - it's the continuous lack of sleep.

Many students love to sleep but think that they don't have time to get enough hours, while others believe that they'd rather be doing something more productive with him or her time.

Many also believe that stress is a factor of sleep deprivation as well.

"It may sometimes be caused be stress and students do come in for stress consultation for which [the Health and Wellness Center] have certain courses," said Jimena Vaillant, Health and Wellness center senior clerk.

Regardless of the reason for why many students aren't getting enough sleep, taking it for granted can have serious health outcomes in the long run.

"I'm not aware of a lot of the consequences of not getting enough sleep, but when I don't sleep enough my body feels it," junior Cristina Guzman said. "It happens all the time during midterms and finals, where I often times go days with about five to six hours of sleep per night. If I do this for a couple of days, in the end, my body simply doesn't function the same. I feel exhausted and it even affects my mood." 

One of the obvious reasons students attend college is to get an education. To reach this goal, the brain must retain information in certain subjects that are later tested on.  

For those who have made sleep deprivation part of their busy schedules, the truth is that sooner or later it takes a toll on students' brains and academic performance.  

A medical website, www.webmd.com, states that sleep deprivation "may have serious consequences both on performance and on the way your brain functions." It also states that research done on young people who took a word examination after staying awake for 35 hours showed that the part of the brain responsible for language had shut down.

Other studies have shown that the average number of hours people sleep per night has decreased from nine to seven and a half in recent years. This might sound like a good amount of hours, but continuous sleep deprivation may also speed up a person's aging process.  

With the popularity that Botox has been enjoying lately, getting those wrinkles a bit earlier in life might not be of big importance to some. But aging also comes with chronic disorders, which may include diabetes and heart disease.

Many students don't sleep enough because of their busy lifestyles. Sleep deprivation can be caused by various factors. Faiza Charles, a wellness assistant at FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus Wellness Center, said she suffers from anxiety symptoms that corrupt her sleep at night.  

"Whenever I'm worried about something or if I have an exam I get so anxious that I can't sleep," Charles said. "I also have trouble sleeping if I have a heavy meal before I go to bed."  

As a student at FIU, she also knows all too well about late night studying.

"I realized that I rather sleep than stay up all night and feel lousy during the exam the following day."

To deal with her anxiety and be able to rest at night, Faiza takes advantage of different courses that the University Wellness Center offers for free. At the courses she's even learned breathing techniques that help her relieve the stress that disturbs her sleep at night.  

Yoga, pilates, meditation, ballet workout classes and nutrition consultants are all available assistance programs to help students lead a healthy life. A particular stress management program offered weekly by the Wellness Center, titled "Cloud 9," even includes free massages and game activities.  

The National Sleep Foundation has categories for different types of sleep patterns that people can quiz themselves on through the web at www.sleepfoundation.org.  

With the impact that sleep has on our bodies, figuring out which category you fall under might be a good way to find out what's triggering your sleeping problem in order to find a solution.

Headline: Fetish parties indulge unusual fantasies for students
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When you walk into any fetish party, the atmosphere is intimidating at first: The persistent bass line of industrial music rattles the bones of the club, while the strobe lights throb like little mechanical organs around the room. Off by the bar, a handsome young couple pours hot wax from bar candles on each other. The dance floor, ornamented with cages and sex swings, is shaking with bodies clad in leather, fishnet and outfits showing plenty of skin. It's not quite the orgy or sex fest many people might assume them to be, but the partygoers seem to be having plenty of fun anyway.  

You've probably never heard of these events before: extravagant parties of leather, whips, cages and nipple pasties. Maybe you know someone who goes to these "fetish parties" and it reminds you of that scene in the movie Party Monster where everyone is dancing seductively to electro clash and wearing macabre outfits. Everyone gets together under one roof to party the night away and rejoice in his or her collective kinki-ness. 

The most popular fetish parties are thrown by thefetishfactory.com; Fetish Factory has been hosting fetish parties each month, a.k.a. the alter ego parties, for nearly a decade. 

According to thefetishfactory.com the party has grown to be the largest monthly strict dress code fetish party in North America, with typical attendance of about 800 people each month. 

Most people who don't go to fetish parties just don't feel comfortable going. A lot of stigma and taboo surrounds the topic of sex and fetish parties, where sexuality is a prominent theme. 

"I wouldn't go to one at the moment," said sophomore Matthew Fay. "I don't know much about them, so they seem dangerous and I would probably feel nervous and uncomfortable."

Others feel it goes against their moral or religious beliefs.  

"I would never go to one because I don't think it's right for people to be throwing their sexuality out there like that," said freshman Cristina Xuarez.  

Are fetish parties really just all about sex and handcuffs?  And who really goes to these parties anyway?

At times, it's not only those who like leather and lace, but also those with more extreme tastes. 

"I go because it feels like Halloween," said senior Daniel Casal. "The people are a lot nicer and they're really cool people too … and I like to lick lobsters."  

Typically, the people who go to fetish parties could be anyone. Partiers come to explore their wilder sides and are encouraged to let go of their inhibitions; the dress code enforces that in a way.  

"[The fetish parties] encourage you to really go all out. The people here have some really cool outfits and I got to wear something I would never wear to any other party," said freshman Isabela Derocha, while tightening her leather jacket around her lace corset before a party.  

No cameras are allowed, which helps keep the partygoers free from worrying about who might see them there.   

"If I ran into my boss [at a fetish party], it'd be kind of awkward at first but then he would be dressed in leather too, so it would just be pretty funny and cool at the same time," Derocha said.  

The fetish partiers go for all kinds of reasons. Some people like the atmosphere, others like the thrill of meeting a complete stranger who shares the same interest as you.  

Ironically, by going to a party that commands certain attire, some find that it's possible to have a good time without worrying how crazy you might look to other people. You can strap on your leather boots, adjust the electrical tape on your nipples and go out with your friends. Like any scene, however, it may not be for everyone.

As the lights flip on and the music fades out, the dance floor slowly empties out into the parking lot. A sexy voice over the loudspeaker thanks everyone for coming and flyers are passed around to announce the date and location of the next fetish party as people leave the discotheque. In a month, it all starts over again.

Headline: Parking lots affected by Youth Fair
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
With the arrival of the 55th Annual Miami-Dade County Youth Fair and Exposition, those commuting to the University Park campus are expected to experience heightened traffic levels and a harder time finding a parking spot.

The fair, which will take place from March 16 to April 2, is a highly anticipated event for the county and city of Miami, as well as a time of stress and inconvenience for some students, faculty and staff at FIU. 

Junior Matthew Gonsalves not pleased about the upcoming fair. 

"Parking is already a huge problem at FIU. It takes a long time to get a spot," Gonsalves said. "But now that the fair is coming, it's going to be worse. It's just ridiculous." 

Bill Foster, director of FIU's Parking and Traffic Department, said that he understands the plight of the students as well as faculty and staff members. 

However, he stated that even though he knows that the traffic coming in and out if the fair is going to be inconvenient, students have to look at the situation from a different point of view.

"The fair is a huge benefit and means of exposure for the University and people need to have some kind of understanding," he said. "Yes, it is an inconvenience, there is no doubt about that, but the University gets a lot of out of it and we need to be patient."

 Foster added that this year there will be one week less to worry about because the second week of the fair will be taking place during Spring Break.

"The benefit that we have this year is that most of the crowd comes in on the first day, which happens to be a Thursday, and then the following week happens to be spring break," Foster said. "So we only have to deal with the last week of the festival as opposed to two weeks."

Over the course of the last decade, the fair has collaborated with the University in organizing the parking scheme. Parking Lots Five and Six were originally built on the grounds of the fair to create additional parking for patrons of the fair. 

The county fair has also been a big supporter of FIU, donating more than $3 million toward the construction of the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, which also partly falls under the county fair property. 

During the fair, Lots Five and Six will be closed to fair patrons for separate reasons.  Lot Five will be used by the fair to house the people who travel with carnivals from state to state and for the staging and preparation of various equipment used during the fair. Lot Six, on the other hand, will be open exclusively to students living on campus.

"We're trying to help housing by keeping traffic away from their lots," Foster said. "Lot Six has a couple of gates that the campus police department will guard during the course of the fair so that no one besides students get to park there."

During the fair, Parking and Traffic will be more lenient toward students. 

"I inderstand that the increase in traffic will cause more students to park in the garages but tickets will most likely not be given out during the tenure of the fair," Foster said. "However, this doesnt mean they can go out and violate the laws. It really depends on the violation. Some violations can't go unnoticed." 

Students complain about the inconviences of the parking situation.

"It's during times like these I'm happy I don't have a car," said Sophomore Diana Carmichael." 

"I remember last year, whenever my roommates and I would go to Publix, it would take a long time to get to Panther Hall," she said. "I didn't like how they would make the students go out of their way to accommodate the fair. It sure felt longer than just two weeks."

The closure of Lots Five and Six to the general public causes traffic to filter into the other parking lots, which results in the displacement of more than 400 vehicles. 

However, since most of the major fair activities begin around 5 p.m., the traffic is relegated to the evening, when most students are done with their classes and thus; according to Foster, the problem isn't as bad as it could have been had the fair been an all-day event.

Foster urges students, faculty and staff members to seek alternative parking spots during the weeks of the fair, which he insisted were widely available across campus despite complaints from many students.

"We have spots in Lot Seven and the Panther Garage, which is located near the [Pharmed Arena]," Foster said. "Those lots are almost always empty. Yes, they are inconveniently placed and they will have to walk to their classes. But if they arrive early then they can avoid the hassle and unnecessary stress."

The Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition is the biggest fair in Florida and one of the largest fairs in the nation. 

Each year the fair raises funds to support youth and adult achievement programs and awards over $500,000 in scholarships, awards and premiums. 

It is estimated that between 20,000 to 60,000 guests attend the fair daily.

Headline: Modeling club focuses on runway skills, print modeling
Author: Dianne Dawkins / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Mystique Modelz has taken center stage to give students a complete fashion report - something students should look out for.    

Mystique Modelz is geared to helping models with or without experience improve his or her modeling skills and self-esteem as well. 

"We represent beauty in different shapes and forms," said senior Mfon Essiet, founder of Myztique Modelz. "Beauty is diverse and we want to show that." 

Currently, Myztique Modelz is the only club at FIU that focuses on the art of runway and print modeling,  according to Essiet.

All models, like Allyse Gibson a sophmore, possess a different style and walk.

"I'm shorter and runways usually call for models that are tall. Myztique gives me a chance to do both print and runway together," Gibson said.

Essiet established Myztique Modelz last summer. 

While there are many dance and singing organizations, Essiet saw a need for another type of performing art at the University.

"We had every type of entertainment at FIU except modeling," Essiet said. 

Essiet felt that the art of modeling was a necessary addition to the club scene at FIU. 

Try-outs were held at the beginning of the Fall semester. 

About 55 students from the Biscayne Bay Campus and University Park attended.

The judges were composed of members of Myztique Modelz's executive board 

Both genders were judged on his or her ability to walk, pose and respond to critique.

Judges also looked at how quickly the models were able to learn stage choreography. 

"The designers are excited when they see that Mystique has male models," said club member senior Rion Daley. "Male modeling is more competitive than female modeling."

Headline: Google self-censorship in China hypocritical
Author: Jonel Nurse-Cupidore / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In its latest strategy, Google has agreed to censor itself for the authorities in Beijing. This action by the leading search engine is somewhat ironic, because this happened soon after it resisted efforts by the U.S. Department of Justice to disclose data on what people were searching for. 

China's market of about 100 million Internet users is certainly a great incentive for Google to want to jump right in and offer their services. What might be the penalty for such an action? 

How can Google, a company belonging to a free and democratic society, go along with the communist ideals of another? It is certainly mind-boggling to think of this relationship.

I see Google as a giant chameleon, changing, to match its surroundings. Indeed, the Internet company has adapted to the government's control in China. The topics being censored include material about human rights, Tibet and other issues considered sensitive to the Chinese government.  

What that translates to is what happened within minutes of the launch of the new site bearing China's web suffix, '.cn.'  People, who were searching for information on banned sites, were directed to articles condemning that topic.  

Don't get me wrong, Google is the only search engine that I use consistently and I have no intentions of changing. 

But the idea of me typing in information into the search bar and being directed to an article censuring my search is unfathomable. 

That reminds me of an e-mail I received a few months ago. Essentially, it said that I had been visiting illegal sites and that I should immediately contact someone named in the e-mail at a Washington, D.C. CIA number. 

I remember breaking out in a sweat wondering which site I had visited and what was going to happen to me. I questioned if I would be fired from my job and all sorts of other foolish questions. 

I tried dialing the D.C. phone number, but was unable to get through. Frantically, I pulled up the CIA website and found the following message: 

"If you receive unsolicited e-mail appearing to be from the CIA, like the recent e-mail falsely attributed to our public affairs office, the message is fake. The CIA never sends unsolicited e-mails to the public. If you are not expecting an e-mail from us, delete it. Do not open any attachment; it may contain malicious code that could damage your computer or mail itself to people in your e-mail address book."

By this time, I began to breathe normal and wondered to myself how I could have even believed the e-mail; how my innocent searches of the dictionary or newspaper sites, or any thing else that I searched, could have triggered such a response. 

It is great to enjoy this freedom and not have to worry about being censored and have my name added to a list. There is something so invasive about that idea, it makes me shudder.

In a statement to MSNBC, Google's senior policy counsel, Andrew McLaughlin, defended the new site, Google.cn, as better serving Chinese customers. 

"In deciding how best to approach the Chinese -or any- market, we must balance our commitments to satisfy the interests of users, expand access to information and respond to local conditions," he said. This statement embodies the chameleon idea. We can only keep our eyes open and pay attention to what happens next.

Subheadline: Herald's motives questionable
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Recent findings from a Miami Herald investigation showed that University President Modesto A.  Maidique has a taste for traveling in style. The Miami Herald concluded that Maidique spent about $80,000 in state money and $60,000 in FIU's private foundation money for travel during the four-year period that it reviewed. 

Looking at the numbers, the first thing that comes to mind is how on earth can someone spend $140,000 on traveling expenses in a span of four years?

Here are just a few examples of The Herald's findings: A trip to Port St. Lucie during which Maidique chartered a private plane and rented a limousine for a total cost of $1,616; stays at The Plaza in New York, the St. Regis in Washington and the Ritz in Madrid; a $6,700 four-day trip to Paris.

Maidique is not a celebrity like Tom Cruise to be spending like this. 

If these findings make you outraged, rightfully so. From a man who complains about FIU's budget problems and who is always looking for people to contribute monetary donations toward the University, it seems somewhat hypocritical to use travel money so recklessly. 

The public has a right to know where its money is going.  Considering that Jesus Diaz Jr., The Herald's publisher, is on the FIU Board of Directors, the timing of the article has to be questioned, considering that Maidique will find out if his much lobbyed medical school proposal will be accepted by the Board of Governors March 23.

Also, although it does not excuse it, it is more or less a well known fact that many University presidents spend lavishly. However, it is certainly not a first-page story. 

We take issue with this as it shows more than anything that Maidique might have been singled out. Even though this fact does not assuage our anger over his actions, it does lead us to wonder what The Herald's motives may have been.

Subheadline: Student disagrees with comparison between Christianity and Scientology
Author: Adrian Mourin / Senior / English Major
&nbsp;
I didn't know what to make out of Adrian Diaz's article "Scientology's beliefs as absurd as Christianity's" published in The Beacon, March 6. At first it was complete nonsense. After careful readings, it was still nonsense. The article lacks fundament and knowledge, revolving around a semi-ironic degree of "awe" that asserts nothing and gets nowhere. Witty remarks do not do any good to anyone. They just look plainly awful in descent journals. 

As far as your title goes, what is absurd in Scientology or in Christianity? You compare Scientology with Christianity and, I'll quote: "It would be easy to dismiss Scientology as a cult populated solely by wackos." Can it be assumed, then, that Christianity (and easily extrapolating to Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, et al) is populated by wackos? Where is Aquinas, Luther, Kant, Descartes and the uncountable others? Your article falls for ignorance and lame mockery, trying to mask itself behind incoherent, rambling sequences only fit in Ionesco's plays. 

You also argue that resurrection and reincarnation "it's all rising from the dead." I'll not preach to the choir, but reincarnation is the cycle of the monad coming back in a new body, to the physical world to learn. Resurrection is just bringing someone from their deceased state, with the same body, ailments, etc. 

It's easy to comment and make easy talk but your sarcasm is ineffective when you want to impresss and elaborate pretentiously on superfluous information. I admire the right for your opinion; however, this doesn't mean you couldn't know more about your subjects. Do try to be a bit more illuminated next time.

Subheadline: Ports debacle seems "close to prejudice"
Author: Paul Benavides / Freshman / Psychology Major
&nbsp;
In response to the article "Foreign companies running ports" (The Beacon: March 2, 2006), Christopher Necuze, the opinion editor, seems to be really misinformed about port operations and security in the U.S.  

Since 9/11, United States ports have been under high oversight. For example, the Port of Miami, under county ownership and supervision, operates itself and its security with oversight from Federal Department of Law Enforcement, the Coast Guard, Custom and Border Protection and the local police. Despite these factors, Necuze continued to argue about a "foreign power in charge of our ports" and "Islamic fascism taking over U.S. port operations." 

According to local investigative journalist Ike Seamans, who has been covering seaports for over 20 years, DP World (the Dubai firm) would only be in "control of nothing but their own operations" and not port operations. (Miami Today: March 2, 2006)  It seems that Necuze's "mistrust for Middle Eastern governments" has allowed him to ignore how real port operations work in the United States.  Furthermore, it seems that the worst part of the situation, according to Necuze, was confessing that he disagrees with George W. Bush and so-called conservative ideals.  Lord have mercy! 

If I didn't know any better, Necuze's article actually treaded close to prejudice towards the Middle East. But, I do not have the courage to call it what conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh has said of this entire situation: racist.

Headline: Iranian threats worsen situation
Author: Christopher Necuze / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Who the hell does Iran think they are? As the nuclear situation between Tehran and the rest of the world heat up, the Iranian government has resorted to intimidation, as it finds itself backed into a corner. 

"The United States has the power to cause harm and pain. But the United States is also susceptible to harm and pain. So if that is the path that the U.S. wishes to choose, let the ball roll." 

Those words, spoken by Ali Asghar Soltanieh, chief Iranian delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency, sent ripples through the international community. Not only is Tehran refusing to relinquish its nuclear program, it is now making threats.

The threatening remarks were said to be in reference to the oil industry, which is among the largest in the world. 

I am the type of person who usually always goes for the underdog. In the World Series, Super Bowl and NBA Championships, I am the one you'll always find rooting for the team less likely to win. 

Let's be honest here, shall we? I understand the modest approach to world policy 'thing' and that flaunting the fact that the United States is the world's only remaining superpower - the one with the world's strongest and most technologically advanced military - would be a very arrogant thing to do.

The only thing that the United States and its allies have threatened Iran with is a trip to U.N. Security Council - the harshest penalty of which, should Iran choose not to cooperate, would be economic sanctions. However, because the Security Council, and the U.N. in general, is incapable of doing anything productive, Iran will probably receive nothing more than an angry letter.

In contrast to the Iraq situation, in which the world was divided in its support for a military intervention, the world is unified in its efforts against Tehran. There is no doubt whether or not Iran has nuclear technology and there is no doubt that they seek nuclear weapons. 

Iran, its officials and its president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, all claim that their uranium enrichment activities are only in efforts for nuclear power. However, when Russia offered to give Iran the necessary uranium they would need for production of nuclear energy - they refused. Anyone find this just a tad suspicious?

Now they are making threats. In the words of White House Spokesman, Scott McClellan, "Provocative statements and actions only further isolate Iran from the rest of the world."

The global community should seek diplomatic means - through the U.N. - to solve this issue, but should not, however, eliminate the possibility of military intervention should Iran fail to meet the demands of the U.N. 

The Unites States and the world must not let itself be pushed around by a rogue country like Iran - or any other, for that matter. The world must stand strong, firm against a tyrant who seeks nuclear weapons and, not to mention, harbors terrorists. An underdog it may be, but for once I am not rooting for the underdog - I hope the underdog is destroyed.

Headline: Lifestyle choices lead to obesity
Author: Brian O. Gonzalez / Contributing Writer 
&nbsp;
Ever walked down the street, or maybe through campus, and saw a man or woman that's twice as large than anyone else around them? Did you want to laugh inside but felt you would offend this stranger? 

Now, we have all seen fat people in our day, maybe everyday. But chances are, that person is obese. Obesity is described as "having a very high amount of body fat in relation to lean body mass, or Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 percent or higher," according to the Center for Disease Control. 

But the definition begins to differ with racial groups. Obesity has been a large topic in the United States and even the world, for years now. Many have claimed it as a growing epidemic that is affecting our children. 

Cartoons and television have been using obesity for slapstick comedy for years now, but in reality, obesity is no laughing matter. Excessive body weight opens up risks for many deadly diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis to name a few. It is also considered a risk factor for certain cancers. When you read this and realize that half of Americans are overweight and a staggering 18 percent are obese, you begin to worry about the health issues of our country.

You can blame the fast food industry and the rise of the "Biggie Size" dynasty, or video games that brainwash the children into preferring a virtual reality playmate than their neighbor, but we don't blame a gun in a murder case. There are two problems with the obese children of America: First, they prefer that lifestyle over any other and, secondly, their parents allow them to be accustomed to that lifestyle. 

Others feel cozy with the excuse that it is genetics and they can not help it. They believe that obesity does not only risk other diseases, but it is a disease itself. These people make me hope Darwin's theory kicks in and natural selection begins to take place. To say you can't help being fat is the ultimate sign of giving up. Don't take my word for it, Carlos Cortes, a board certified doctor said in an interview with The Beacon, "You are not predetermined on your weight, genetics have nothing to do with it."

This article can run on for pages on my argument that obesity is not a disease, but the fact is there is no argument that obesity is, in fact, a disease. While that makes my argument easier, it also renders it pointless. The fact is you're eating more calories than you are burning a day. 

I'm no doctor, but I sure can count. Subtract one donut plus a jog around the block equals a better body. Bet they didn't teach you that in Algebra did they? I'm not your mother so I can't tell you not to stop using that lame excuse on your weight. For those that want to do something about it, see you guys at the gym.

Headline: World Baseball Classic great for everyone
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I must admit, when the proposal for a worldwide baseball tournament featuring Major League Baseball players joining their respective countries in March came out, I was a bit skeptical. Then again, anything that MLB Commissioner Bud Selig draws up brings out the cynic within me.

However, like the players, once it began and fans decorated stadiums all over the world with painted faces and flags waving, I was sucked into the magic the World Baseball Classic brings.

I'm sure even New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who hollered like nobody else about the wrongness of the tournament, must've gotten chills when he saw his Yankee players take the field with USA across their chest.  

ESPN analyst and former Cubs pitcher Rick Sutcliffe was brought to the team to throw batting practice and work with pitchers. Listening to him talk in the booth during the March 7 game against Mexico must have been like hearing Lewis and Clark talk about their journeys of the West.

On one particular incident, he walked into the clubhouse where players were having breakfast and as he turned his head, there were Alex Rodriguez and Jason Varitek sitting beside each other. 

Just two years ago, Rodriguez had the Red Sox catcher in a headlock to try to kill him, these days the only headlock he gets is for the occasional noogie. 

No longer are these players separated by MLB rivalries. They're part of something bigger and only those that are taking part can truly capture it.

In an era bombarded with steroid rants, off-field accusations and all the other things a professional sport dominated by money can bring, the World Baseball Classic brings a diversion from the evil in baseball and funnels it back to its purest form, which represents a true joy for the game.



INJURIES NOT AN EXCUSE



This spring, many players and owners had negative views on the tournament because of the possibility of injury. They claimed players were responsible for the MLB teams they played for and could not run the risk of getting hurt before the start of the regular season.

This has to be the most ridiculous excuse when you think of baseball players' recent injuries.  

A little over two years ago, Aaron Boone nearly broke his knee in half playing a pickup basketball game; Jeff Kent hurt himself riding a motorcycle and I got my foot caught in the door and was not 100 percent for a critical pingpong match that awaited me.

The point is, injuries happen no matter what the situation. Besides, what are these players doing in March. Aren't they playing baseball?

USA Manager Buck Martinez has done a great job rotating his players and not overworking his pitchers so that injuries are very unlikely.   



TIMING IS PERFECT



Another thing the richest babies in the world complained about was the timing for the event.  

I feel the timing could not have been any better.

There were only two different alternatives to holding the tournament during spring training. Either hosting it after the regular season, or throwing it right in the middle of the year.

After the wear and tear of 162 games and the playoffs, I doubt anybody would want to go overseas and start playing some more baseball.  

A lot more players are injured at that point and if you think a lot of people backed out at this time, imagine how many would reject their invitations in October or November.

Having it during the middle of the season is also ludicrous. The  league already holds an all-star game and besides, you're going to have Major League Baseball play eighty-some-odd games and then give it a month break? 

What about the players that don't play, you're telling me they're going to go back home for 30 days and come back to be in full swing for the most important part of the season!?

I think the only thing wrong with the timing is that this should have been done a long time ago.  

Imagine Roberto Clemente getting a chance to represent Puerto Rico, Fernando Valenzuela playing for the Mexican team or Japanese homerun king Sadaharu Oh and Hank Aaron facing off.

The possibilities would have been endless then and they are mind boggling now.



AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD



Unlike in 1992 when USA basketball began using NBA players for its Olympic team, the World Baseball Classic is competitive because the USA baseball team will not be as dominnant the Dream Team was over its opponents. 

Sure, USA has a great team, but anybody from Venezuela to the Dominican Republic to the Canadian team that defeated USA 8-6 on March 8 can win this competition.

No longer does anything inside of me say this was a bad idea. If you want to know how much of an impact it has had, just ask the players that are taking part.

Chipper Jones told ESPN after he hit a homerun in an exhibition game, "it was the single greatest moment in my life to hit a homerun with the USA jersey on and have Ken Griffey Jr. waiting for me at home plate."

"I've played in a lot of playoff games and a World Series and I have never been as nervous as I was [March 7]," said Boston Red Sox reliever Mike Timlin before USA's game against Mexico.

The owners and the players that shied away from it can try to dispel it all they want but this thing actually means something.  At a level it never has before, baseball is serving as the driving force to unite a world split by terrorism, government and religion.  

The only common ground they share is the wonderful game of baseball, and for one special month this spring, it's all they'll need.

Headline: Men's team fails to meet expectations
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Having followed the men's basketball team all season, their 20-point first round loss to New Orleans in the Sun Belt Conference tournament was no real surprise. 

In what started out as a very exciting season, with the Sun Belt Conference coaches picking FIU to finish second in the division, the Golden Panthers plummeted in December and never really recovered their confidence. 

The Dec. 8 home win against first-year Big East member South Florida was the highlight of the season. A season that saw them win just eight games and lose 20 - one more victory than USF, who played in arguably the nation's toughest conference. 

Though some may have other reasons for this team's struggles, my belief is that their underachievement can be tracked through consistent trends night in and night out. 

For starters, the team's reliance on Ivan Almonte proved to be head coach Sergio Rouco's biggest flaw. Any coach will tell you, you need two guys to win games. I understand that this team was built around Almonte, but no one can expect him to carry the team on his back for 40 minutes every night. He's not a scorer; he's a rebounder. 

Though at times it seemed as though someone else might fill that role, it never happened. 

The year's biggest disappointment had to be Ismael N'Diaye. The senior, who made clutch shots and proved he could be that key second option last season, never recovered from injury following last year and was not the same player this season. 

Some may say these things happen and someone else will be there to fill the void. Nope, not on this team, no one planned for that. Because of N'Diaye's struggles, the team sputtered many times offensively, even seeming lost, unable to run plays and consequently falling apart. 

An argument could be made as to how anyone can expect to succeed with so many new players (FIU carried over only five from last season), but shouldn't that be part of building a program? Shouldn't those players fit the role automatically? I'm sure they brought in players by promising them playing time in their first year. 

So what happened? 

There were flashes of brilliance from new players, who may lead this team next season. But that is all there was - flashes. Maybe this is part of growing up.  

Johwen Villegas showed us his 3-point range on occasion. Most of the time he seemed to lack offensive ability, which cost this struggling offensive team more than anything. Though he may have had a good year shooting from beyond the arc, it seemed like, when he stepped inside the arc, he was allergic to the basket. Incredibly enough, for a guy who shot on 74 3-pointers at 38 percent, he was a lowly 50 percent from the free-throw line. 

Freshman Elvis Lora was another conundrum. He too had flashes, like Villegas, of a player who could pick up the offensive slack. A two-minute flicker in the season's final game proved that. Too little too late - the story of this team's season. 

Inconsistency every night really cost this team. If one important player showed up, the other didn't. That's no way to win games, and they didn't when it counted - finishing with just four wins out of 14 Sun Belt matches.   

The most common trend was their ability to come out flat most nights, struggling to score points in the first 10 minutes of play and falling drastically behind by the first half or early on in the second half. On certain occasions, the team would make a big second half run, but most times it was too little too late. 

When the games were close, however, it was the free throw shooting that let them down. FIU would miss free throws when it counted as other teams would make them. Too many of this season's losses came apart at the end of the game, because of a lack of killer instinct - the ability to put teams away when the chance is given to you. 

Fingers can be pointed in many directions here: The coaches or the inexperience of the players.

The offensive struggles of this team were what really spoiled everything. The big thing coming into this season was that the team supposedly brought in scorers - one thing the team lacked in previous seasons. Even though we saw some signs of this,  we were left wanting much, much more.

Next season it will be tough for this team to fill the void left by Almonte. They have a player in Kenny Simms who, with maturity, could be that next star.

Simms has shown he can score, rebound, and block shots - the three things you want from an ideal big man. 

If Simms can find that maturity, if Lora can find the willingness to put the team on his scoring shoulders, and if Villegas can be that 3-point threat, this team has a bright future. 

However, that's what was said last season about this year's team. 

Maybe it's better to keep expectations low. It's harder to be disappointed.

Headline: FRESHMAN SENSATION
Subheadline: First-year pressure does not disturb shortstop
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It's not often that a team is fortunate enough to acquire a freshman with the skills and potential to make a strong impact. FIU's recruitment of freshman shortstop Alex Alfonso is an exception.

Ever since he could remember, Alfonso knew that baseball was what he wanted to do. As he got older, his talent became more notable and his skills further developed. Perhaps such a development was the result of having a father who constantly pushed him to improve his game. 

"He always took me to the field [to play]," Alfonso said.

In addition to earning four letters in baseball - and one in football - while he attended Christopher Columbus High School, Alfonso also put up impressive numbers. Over the four years of his high school career he batted .350 with five homeruns and 25 RBI. He earned Honorable Mention All-State Honors as a senior, and was a member of the Class 6A 2004 Championship team as a junior.

Even though Alfonso's numbers caught the attention of many in high school, he was not guaranteed a lot of playing time, much less a starting role as a collegiate athlete.

"I thought I was going to have to work a lot harder," Alfonso said.

One of Alfonso's main objectives would be to replace Luis Rivera, FIU's starting shortstop for the past three seasons. Rivera finished the 2005 season with a .304 batting average, 25 RBI and was superb defensively. 

"He definitely has some big shoes to fill, but he is coming along," said head coach Danny Price.

In his first 13 games played as the starting shortstop, Alfonso is batting .250 with 4 RBI and one homerun. He also has the second highest on-base percentage at .457.

Not only can he play defense -  34 assists and four double-plays as of  March 10 - but he comes through in clutch situations. Alfonso has proven that the paradigm in which rookies crack under pressure should be re-considered. The most recent example is his two-out RBI hit in the 10th inning off of Michigan State reliever Mike Monterey, which helped FIU seal a come-from-behind victory March 7. 

Even though some players have trouble adapting to their new team and its environment when they first arrive,  the 5-10 freshman said it was very easy. However, there are still some aspects of the game that he is familiarizing himself with. 

"The speed of the game is really fast and I'm still adjusting to it," Alfonso said. "Everyday I learn something new."

Price added, "He's going to make freshman mistakes, but his consistency is getting better."

Although many players get discouraged from some of their mistakes, Alfonso knows that he has his teammates and coaching staff to help him grow. 

"They constantly push me to be a better player and to learn from my mistakes," Alfonso said.

Besides having his teammates and coaches persistently encourage him to improve, Alfonso also plays by professional advice given to him regarding the attitude toward the game. 

"I talk to some of the guys in the minors and they say that you really have to love it [baseball] to stick with it for so long and to get far," Alfonso said.

Giving his all in every game, Alfonso has the potential to become a very successful player. 

"His work ethic is what makes him [the player that he is] and what will help him [become a better player]," Price said.

Although the season and his career have only started, Alfonso has set certain goals for himself that he hopes to attain prior to leaving FIU. 

Becoming an overall better player is one of his main goals; however, playing in the postseason is what he is striving for. 

"My main goal is to get far. I constantly think about the [College] World Series. I know we can definitely reach it."
