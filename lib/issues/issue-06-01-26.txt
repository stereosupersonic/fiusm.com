Headline: Women defeat Ragin' Cajuns decisively
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It was a battle between the two Sun Belt Conference leaders Jan. 21 at Pharmed Arena as the Golden Panthers faced the West Division leading University of Louisiana-Lafayette in their sixth conference game of the season.

But the game was not as close, as expected, as FIU convincingly outplayed the Ragin' Cajuns and ousted them in a 72-47 victpory.  

With nine games left in the regular season, the Golden Panthers are expected to finish atop the East Division of the Sun Belt Conference.

And following a big-time win over a quality program, the Golden Panthers are in a better position than ever to do some damage in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament starting March 2. 

"It was definitely a big win for us and it got our confidence up," said point guard Faeza Bouderra, who matched a career-high with 20 points. "But it just goes to show you that any team can win at any time.  If you look at the scores day in and day out, there are a lot of lopsided victories."

The win was FIU's third in a row and their fifth in the last six games. They improved their record to 12-6 overall and 5-1 in conference play.

The Golden Panthers started off early with a 12-0 run lead by Lasma Jekabsone's dominating presence in the paint.  

Jekabsone capped off the night with 26 points, 15 rebounds and two 3pt shots. It is her thirteenth career double-double and seventh of the year.

"She has been big for us all season and it's not a surprise to me [that she made two three-pointers]," Bouderra said. "At practice she always hits threes. I'm just glad she took them because it opens up our offense even more."

 FIU increased their lead to as much as 13 in the first half. But with four minutes to go before intermission and FIU leading 29-16, the women were held to just two free throws as ULL went on a 13-2 run and finished the half trailing 31-29.

"I just told them they had to get a grip or that team was going to beat us," said head coach Cindy Russo. "I knew we were a little tired but they also knew they couldn't rest in the second half."

Coming out of the gate in the second half was reigning Sun Belt Conference player of the week Yolanda Jones, who ended up with a team-high 14 points for ULL. 

Jones hit on a pair of early free throws to narrow the lead even more  but Bouderra answered right back and put a permanent halt to ULL's run as she scored five straight points to spark a 10-1 stretch that put FIU up 50-34 with 12 minutes remaining.

"I think the key for [our play in the second half] was that we picked it up on defense," Bouderra said. "We were able to hold them to fewer points and out rebound them."

It was smooth sailing from then on as the Ragin' Cajuns were stifled on defense and held to just four field goals.  FIU ended up outscoring ULL 41-18 in the second half, while keeping their turnovers - a problem for this team all year - at a season-low twelve.

"It's just a sign that we're getting better," Russo said. "It was a combination of them playing a sagging man defense and us creating a lot of our offense off of their turnovers."

The Golden Panthers will have a full week of rest heading into their next match against South Dakota State Jan. 28 at Pharmed Arena.

Headline: Men win back-to-back conference games
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's basketball team began a winning streak Jan. 21,  two nights after it ended an 11-game losing streak.

FIU (5-13, 2-4) rallied at the end of the first half and throughout the second half to put away the two-time defending Sun Belt Conference champions, Louisiana-Lafayette (4-12, 0-5), 55-50, ending a four-game home losing streak and winning back-to-back games for the first time since Dec. 1. 

"We clawed," said head coach Sergio Rouco, following the win. "This is the way we win games, playing defense."

Senior Ivan Almonte put together another double-double performance but struggled until the second half to get it going. He finished the night with 10 points and 14 rebounds; the second successive game he notched more rebounds than points. 

Johwen Villegas and Facundo Giorgi came off the bench to lead the team in scoring with 14 and 12, respectively. 

Giorgi was clearly the main man, transforming his play from both the perimeter to the inside and even making a presence defensively. 

"I think this is something that we needed," Giorgi said. "Win the first game and then start to play well. We are really happy about it and now we have to keep winning and working hard as we have so far so we can get another victory next week."

The first-year Argentinean nailed his first shot of the game, a 3pt attempt that marked the Golden Panthers first field goal of the night, and constantly drove to the basket, which led to three trips to the free throw line. 

"Making the first shot as soon as I got into the game helped me to raise my confidence a little and as the coaches always tell me, just play with confidence because you can help the offense [get] to another level," Giorgi said. "I just came ready to play and am really happy for the team because we won."

Villegas, who ended the night four of 10 from behind the three-point arc connected on back to back threes in the second half to give FIU the momentum heading into the final stretch. 

Ismael N'Diaye continued his run of form, becoming the fourth Golden Panther to reach double figures and ending the night with 11 points but, most importantly, sealed the game late in the second half. 

Following a Lafayette missed three-point attempt with 29.7 seconds to play, FIU managed to strip the ball away from Cajun big man Michael Southall and call a timeout. 

With memories of past mishaps with less then 30 seconds to play Rouco called the play of the game as N'Diaye broke the length of the court, received the inbound pass and slammed it down to put FIU ahead for good with 51-47, leaving just 26.7 seconds to play. 

Turnovers were the story of the night as the teams combined for 47, with the Rajin' Cajuns giving the ball away, a season-high, 25 times. 

FIU's solid defense and Lafayette's inability to hold onto the ball offensively, made it a long night for a team that was used to scoring many points with four men averaging in double figures. 

Southall was the only visitor to break that mark on the night, finishing with 13 points and nine rebounds to go along with four blocks. 

"We're not a very good shooting team," Rouco said. "But we can hold people to 50. Once our shots start falling, we will beat teams by more points. Offense is going to come; you are going to make shots. What you can't do is take a day off on defense and we don't."

Dwayne Mitchell, Lafayette's leading scorer and rebounder, who coming in was averaging 17.7 points and an NCAA leading 10.8 rebounds as a guard, was shut down by Rouco's defensive scheme and fouled out late in the game with just nine points and three rebounds. 

Following the victory, Rouco was sure to keep the win in perspective.

"Our kids are beginning to get confident," Rouco said. "They got pounded on early in the season. Our goal is to win this thing; our goal is not to win one more game. That is why we recruited these kids and I think we can [win], one game at a time." 

Now the Golden Panthers must turn their attention to the number one team in the SBC East, Western Kentucky, who head to town Jan. 31 boasting a current 5-1 conference record.  

"I am proud of my kids, hanging in there and we have won two league games in a row; it is very hard to win two in a row in this league," Rouco said. "We are looking forward to a couple of days off and getting back to work against Western Kentucky who is the top dog in our division."

Headline: Comical Internet clips lose their appeal, fill up inbox
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
I'm not a complete internet prude. I've sung along with the chubby 'Numa, Numa' guy as he lip-synched to that upbeat Romanian pop song; I laughed with my roommates throughout freshman year at the antics of crazy Japanese boy band Yatta; I even chuckled at the Matrix Ping Pong players who did twists and somersaults as the ball passed from paddle to paddle.

But after the umpteenth e-mail sent to me by a friend turned out to be another awkward looking white guy performing some incredibly stupid stunt in front of a hazy webcam, I realized that I had had enough. From then on, e-mails with titles like "You've gotta see this!!!" or "No way, dude!!! Check it out!!!" would immediately be erased, followed by a punch in the face to whomever thought I desperately needed to see an Australian rock that resembled a penis.

To say that I'm surrounded by these 'comical,' made-for-Internet video clips would be a nauseating understatement - not only do people I know constantly talk about this or that week's latest online gerbil-swallower - but pop culture itself has become fascinated with gigaoddities (what I call these web clips and Internet knick knacks), creating shows like VH1's "Web Junk 20" which weekly charts the Internet's greatest freaks.

And it's not just the inundation of these clips that bother me. Yes, most of them are actually not as funny as hyped and yes, many of them are just clones of copies of borrowed subjects (always with the lip-synching); what really irritates me is the instant and crashing fame that follow these MP3 nightmares; turning into realities Andy Warhol's comment that everybody gets their 15 minutes of fame.

These days, anybody with an Internet connection, some sort of camera and sloppy haircut can be assured media coverage and mass adoration. As long as they're willing to strip themselves of all self dignity and worth (along with maybe a few items of clothing), these determined exhibitionists know that they'll have an appearance in "Good Morning, America" waiting for them, as well as the love of millions of procrastinating college students.

From Ukulele Hall-of-Famer Tiny Tim to the basement recordings of Dr. Demento, American society has always had a penchant for loving the freakish and unusual, whether in secret or openly. But there was a time when real heroes and issues stood side-by-side with the bizarre, not hand in hand. Who cares that Iran is preparing to reopen nuclear power plants if we're busy waiting for the next William Hung? Why worry about poverty in Africa when you have to send that latest clip of drunken cheerleaders making out to your buddies?

Sitting somewhere out in the American heartland, the bespectacled, chubby 'Numa, Numa' guy thinks about all this on his silent couch … and cries.

Subheadline: Student displeased by high bus fares
Author: Jared Coello / Electrical Engineering Major / Sophmore
&nbsp;
I read the article published on Jan. 23 about the increase in shuttle bus fees and I find it ridiculous that the price is going up. I would have to catch the shuttle every day to University Park because all the engineering classes are held there. Not only that, but the shuttle runs on a weird time schedule. In order for me to be on time to my class at 1:10 at UP I would have to catch the 11:20 shuttle. Then catch the CAT which takes me to the Engineering Center. There are days that I would spend two-plus hours on the shuttle for an hour class.

Headline: MySpace: not for those over 30
Author: Elayne Cardoso / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The term revolution means several things. What it means for cyberspace users of the 21st century can be seen just by walking through most computer labs across campus and seeing virtually everyone surfing the same website, MySpace. 

One single word can mean hundreds of friends, blogging, instant messaging, public photos, reconnecting with old classmates, public advertising from clubs and local events and even dating. 

As strange as it may sound, this has become increasingly popular for among college students and adults.

More users of MySpace are surprisingly 20-something-year olds, which in other eras, were more concerned with work, finishing school and the common every day tasks, which left little or no time at all for hobbies such as those which the addictive cybernetic world of MySpace encompasses.  

Logically, societies tend to change over time and new fads are created. Growing up, I remember some of the trends which came my way. In the 1980s a music revolution hit, and nearly everyone wanted to be listening to music at all times of the day. 

The Walkman was the iPod of the day. Though America has had an obsession with television long before the past decade, the '90s introduced the sitcom and 'reality tv' with the start of shows such as "Friends" and "The Real World." 

Now in the 21st century, the trend seems to be more along the lines of faster communication through instant messaging via the internet, and MySpace of course, which itself is revolutionizing college campuses around the nation. 

As technology advances, the sense of communicating through word of mouth and face-to-face is becoming less personal and more digital. 

No one could have imagined the impact of communicating via instant messaging, blogs and sites such as MySpace in the past. 

"MySpace takes over people's lives and changes the way we communicate," said sophomore Katherine Leal. 

People become enchanted with the possibility of meeting new individuals while at home, work and even school. 

The person you least expected to have a MySpace, your boss in this case, is probably an avid user who is above the age to still be using silly, immature ways to communicate with colleagues and acquaintances, better known as other MySpace users who should not be allowed to even have profiles. 

In American society, we have come to accept that the new, modern and 'hip' way of communicating is through blogging and sending messages to friends - which has taken on a new meaning. It's more about how many 'friends' a person can have and how many times a day a person signs on to view comments or messages left by other MySpace users. 

And in moments when boredom strikes, people of all ages find themselves chatting through the exchange of messages and comments, better known as the term 'myspacing.' 

The virtual world of MySpace encourages users to become addicted to the feeling of friendships via the Internet in an impersonal way. 

This poses the question: Should adults be using the same method that students use to meet and become acquainted and enamored with a person's web page, rather than the actual person?

Times have changed, and so have the users of the Internet who use MySpace as an escape from the surreal duties of being a 'grown-up'. 

One can only hope that the responsibilities of becoming older and accepting the sense of duty are not blurred by the fascination of MySpace.

Headline: University to implement new, faster e-mail system
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
The University will implement a new e-mail system with new features beginning Jan. 30, replacing FIU Webmail, which will shut down Jan. 27 and restart Feb. 3.

Yogi Misir, associate director for customer relations and communications for the University Technology Services, is confident that "students will love" the new system.

"We are most excited about the speed [of the new system], students, faculty and staff complain on how slow the [old system is]," he said.

Students will have access to Mirapoint, the new e-mail, beginning at 8 p.m. Feb. 3.

The migration period for the files and folders to transfer (with the exception of files in the trash folder) from the old system to the new one will take place between Jan. 27 and Feb. 3. 

After this period, the University will have a chance to make sure all files were properly transferred over to the new system. 

For two weeks (Jan. 4 until Feb. 18), students will be able to access their old accounts to verify that everything was transferred correctly. 

According to Misir, the changes in systems are attributed to the slow performance of Webmail and the lack of new features that students, faculty and staff wanted.

The features will include message writing in formats other than plain text and an enhanced new address book which will include the transferred addresses from the old account.

The old system allowed students a measly 10 megabytes of e-mail space while the new system will ofer an upgrade of 100 megabytes. Webmail held 170 megabytes for faculty and staff and that will go up to 300 megabytes.

The new system will include access to quota information with a status bar to show users what percentages of the megabytes are in use.

 It will also delete junk mail placed into the trash. 

An anti-spam program will specify if the message is spam or not and the system will automatically delete the items in the trash after 30 days.

UTS offices picked students, faculty and staff in May 2004 to help evaluate different e-mail systems and Mirapoint proved to be the most popular.

Mike Kirgan, assistant director of UTS operations and enterprise system, stated that a testing of the system file migration began December 2005 and will end this week.

"All functions and testing of the migration has worked out seamlessly," Misir said.

Missir also stated that the University executive committee allocated half a million dollars in funding for the new system, which is derived from university state funding.

If you have any questions about the Mirapoint E-mail Project, you can contact UTS at utsfyi@fiu.edu.

LOCAL:
Man set free after 24 years in prison, was found innocent by DNA evidence

After 24 years in prison, Alan Crotzer from St. Petersburg was released Jan. 23, making him the fifth long time convict in Florida proven innocent through DNA evidence. The first things Crotzer did as a free man were to learn how to use a cell phone and how to swipe a card into a hotel door - all technologies which were not around at the time of his arrest in 1982. 

Crotzer and two other men were convicted of robbing a family in Tampa, kidnapping and raping a 38-year-old mother and her 12-year-old daughter. Crotzer was picked out of a police photo lineup and the jury sided with the prosecutors. Crotzer had requested a DNA test to prove he wasn't guilty and was denied. It was not until he contacted Innocence Project, an organization based in New York, that the organization took up his case in 2002. 

His lawyer, David Menschel continued to work with Crotzer even after he went into private practice because he believed his client was innocent. The sisters of the two men that Crotzer was convicted with told Menschel that her brothers, Douglas and Corlenzo James never knew Crotzer and later Douglas James agreed. When Crotzer was found innocent, the James' sisters celebrated his release with a barbeque. 

At first, it was thought that the only piece of evidence from clothing found in the crime scene had been thrown away. Menschel and Sam Roberts, another lawyer involved with the case, went to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement looking for a file with details about the evidence. 

It turned out that in that file, the FDLE came across tiny slides which contained DNA taken from the victims. The Hillsborough state attorney's office cooperated with Menschel in testing the slides and they did so twice. 

A Florida state law that allows long time inmates to prove there innocence with DNA evidence expires in July. The Florida Innocence Initiative hopes that Crotzer's case will persuade lawmakers to change their minds.

Democrats rally against Alito nomination

Democratic critics are still trying to rally against Samuel Alito's recommendation for Supreme Court Justice. 

Alito was President George W. Bush's pick to replace Sandra Day O' Connor. 

All except 10 Republican senators announced their support for Alito, leaving  eight Democratic senators no possibility of stopping the committee from giving Alito a recommendation. 

Democrats believe that if confirmed, Alito will swing the Supreme Court vote to the right. 

After the committee votes, the nomination goes to the Senate for a final vote before Jan. 31. 


GLOBAL:
Previous year warmest in century

According to a federal analysis, researchers calculated that 2005 produced the highest annual average surface temperature.

James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said that the only year that reached the same temperature as 1998, was 2005 with out help from "El Nino." 

This is why 2005 can be considered as the hottest year of the century.

The Earth has warmed up a little more than one degree which makes it the warmest it's been in 10,000 years.

Hansen blames the build up of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.

Headline: Women's Center not just for women
Author: Eddith Sevilla / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For the past year, the Women's Center at FIU has spent time designing new brochures, going to first year experience classes and making connections with programs with high female population. 

All these efforts have been made to inform students that the center exists once again according to Suzanne Onorato, the associate director for the center. 

However, informing people that the center has reopened has not been the only focus. 

On the contrary, the center has kept busy with the various programs and services it offers - such as its mentoring program, developed to connect female students with either a staff member or alumnus who serves as a mentor.

Although the center is not solely for women, the program is designed specifically for women because the funds are intended for female usage.

"The National Organization for Women (NOW) is the activist group associated directly with the Women's Center," Onorato said. 

With 500,000 members and 550 chapters, NOW is the largest organization of female empowerment in the United States. The organization takes action to bring about equality for all women and to end all forms of violence against them. 

Although the organization has been running since 1966, FIU's chapter was only  recently acknowledged. 

"It's a new group and in August [of 2005] is when they were officially recognized as a student organization," Onorato said.

Each month, in a series called "Wild, Succulent Women," students engage in controversial discussions when the center holds a forum to discuss topics related to women's issues.

"We've done programs concerning body image, sexuality and relationships," Onorato said. "The topics are meant to be cutting edge of what college students are facing today and when we are talking about those things it [makes] it not so taboo and so that people feel more comfortable talking about it and expressing themselves." 

Last March, the center held a "Take Back the Night" event to specifically address how domestic violence occurs on college campuses. 

Male students participated with a presentation and a banner that helped to raise money for a domestic violence shelter.

While the center's mission is to provide support for female students and help them become successful, it also promotes personal, professional and intellectual growth and development for students. 

A center can be found at the Biscayne Bay Campus and University Park.

However, demographics has played a major role in deciding which programs work best at BBC. 

"The things that have been really successful at BBC are the things that seem to relate better to the students there," Onorato said. 

Designed by the students, the topics for the "Wild Succulent Women" program have been quite successful, according to Onorato and are open for everyone, drawing the attention of both men and women.

"The conversations (then) focused on what's particular to the lives of those women," Onorato said. "In a sexuality program, I found that the students at BBC seemed to be more open about the discussion. They seemed more comfortable and confident. It didn't seem as taboo to them." 

For more information, visit the Women's Center located on the second floor of the Wolfe University Center or contact Suzanne Onorato at (305) 919-5359.

Headline: Court trial begins for former FIU officer
Subheadline: Victims give testimony in court, accuse Currie of sexual assault
Author: Andrew Leins / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
Opening arguments and testimony began Jan. 24 in the trial of former FIU public safety officer, Frederick E. Currie, who was arrested July 20 of last year after being charged with sexual assault on an 18-year-old girl in Tamiami Park. 

During the trial, which took place at the Richard Gerstein Justice Building in North West Miami, the alleged victim testified about the incident along with her boyfriend, who was also present the night of the assault.

With TV cameras rolling inside the courtroom, jurors heard opening statements from the prosecution and defense. The female victim's testimony was emotionally charged, tears in her eyes as she described what allegedly happened to her. 

In her testimony, she claimed that after going out to eat and going to a club on the night of July 7, the couple went to a spot near the baseball field at Tamiami Park, located at 11201 SW 24th Street, where they parked their vehicle at approximately 1:30 a.m.

They claim not to have seen Currie approaching the vehicle as he had all the lights off on his patrol car. 

They stated that Currie ordered them out to search the vehicle for drugs. He then frisked each one individually while the other sat in the car. 

It was during this frisking that the alleged assault occurred. 

"When he was searching me he seemed nervous," she said.

Afterwards, Currie told them that it was dangerous to be outside so late. 

He allegedly told them that they should have gone to a motel. The female victim said she "read badge number 181."

Currie never reported the incident to anyone and never informed the dispatcher that he had come across the two teens.

When he was leaving, the victims said Currie backed over a curb and his patrol car got stuck, needing  help to get it out. The boyfriend said he helped Currie push it over the curb. 

The victims placed a call to the dispatcher which was played for the jury in the court room. In it, the male victim described the incident. 

On the tape, the couple seemed confused and were not sure whether or not Currie's actions were part of the procedure when searching for drugs.

They drove back to the girl's mother's house and told her what happened.

They then went to the Public Safety Office and reported what happened. The victims claim the sergeant on duty was enraged. They told the public safety officers the badge number they saw on Currie. 

Public Safety had the victims pick out their assailant from pictures of the officers on duty that night. In court, the victims identified Currie as their assailant and each made a sworn statement. 

Miami-Dade detectives were also called in to assist the investigation.  The girl was taken to a rape treatment center and examined by a doctor.

The first day's proceedings also had the mother of the 18-year-old girl testifying. 

More was expected for the second day including testimony from FIU Public Safety officers and the doctor who examined the female victim. 

Currie was placed on administrative leave with pay immediately following the incident and was arrested July 20. 

Currie posted bond recently and is facing one count of sexual battery and one count of battery.

Currie has had a checkered past, including two arrests for assault and one for child abuse, though the charges were dropped in each case.

Though he is a nine-year veteran of FIU public safety, he has been twice fired and later rehired due to the dismissals being overturned by an outside hearing officer. 

Currie has been on administrative leave with pay since the incident and his future at FIU hinges on the outcome of the trial and an internal affairs investigation within the FIU Police Department. 

When Captain Jessie Scott was asked if this incident would affect the University and how FIU hires police officers he said the "The FIU PD always follows the standards for hiring set forth by the Florida Department of law enforcement." At press time the outcome of the trial was still pending.

Headline: King Tutankhamun
Subheadline: Exhibit displays Egyptian artifacts
Author: Michelle Santisteban
&nbsp;
Egypt has always been a place of wonder, mystery and exciting discoveries. Pyramids, mummies, and Pharohs: all invoking passion and beauty. 

Now, after 27 years, people are being given the chance to stand face-to-face with artifacts which lied in the hands of one of histories most infamous kings, King Tutankhamun. 

The artifacts were brought to the United States previously in 1979 and now, for the first time, they have been brought to Florida. 

Held at the Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale, the exhibit traces the life of a nine-year-old boy who ruled Egypt between 1333-1323 B.C. and mysteriously died around the age of 19. 

As you first walk in, a 3,200-year-old black stone statue of Tutankhamun is displayed. Yet, the statue is not the most grandiose element, there is much more to be seen. 

All the artifacts are elegantly displayed and made easy for visitors to see. The ambiance suggests a peek into the unknown.   

All the pieces are in magnificent condition and it is incredible to be able to see how the gold still shines after thousands of years; the detailing is just as meticulous and the craftsmanship is way beyond its time. The jewelry is still perfectly intact, made out of gold so rich that it seems jewelers spent endless hours creating it.

It strikes you when you try to understand how the Egyptians were able to make such pieces without the technology we have today. Scientists are still trying to uncover how the pyramids where built using only the strength of men and no machinery.

Whether Egypt intrigues you or not, this exhibition will leave you breathless. It's not everyday that you can see artifacts that have so much history. 

With statues of Queen Nefertiti, serpent goddesses and funerary masks, visitors should expect a real sense of history. Stunning sculptures of royal busts, a chair said to be where Tutankhamun actually sat as a child and animations of what Tutankhamun actually looked like, contributed to the experience. 

Even though many museum critics bashed the exhibit for making it look too Hollywood-ish - like a scene straight out of the movie The Mummy - the exhibit was spectacular. Each piece was accompanied by a brief, yet informative, description that anyone can understand. 

Walking through the exhibit felt as if though it were 1332 B.C. The lighting was dim, with each artifact having only light on itself. Most of the rooms were dark with many having writings on the walls, creating the image of hieroglyphics carved into the stones of the pyramids. 

However, with all its marvelous displays, something was missing - a mummy. At an exhibit based on Egyptian artifacts, a mummy wrapped in its white linens would have been nice to see. 

Another disappointment  was that Tutankhamun's body nor his sarcophagus is found at the exhibit. Under Egyptian law, his body is not allowed to leave the country. The exhibit consists only of things found in his tomb.

Many photographs of the men who discovered Tutankhamun's tomb back in 1922 are hanging for all to see. Strangely though, their names are no where to be found. Not much information is given on the actual first discovery of the tomb. Popular belief had it that the two men who discovered the tomb died because of a curse placed to protect the King's burial place and its treasures.

It is said that Egyptians put spells on the gold and sarcophagus of Tutankhamun so that it may not be removed from its location. 

"The treasures were meant to ensure his divine immortality" was written on the museum walls. Perhaps there are some things which should remain undiscovered and untouched.

Yet every Saturday during the month of January, it can be found at Macy's Home Stores at Dadeland and Aventura Mall. The department stores are hosting a Star Chef series where free cooking classes with world-renowned chefs are offered. 

Macy's guest on Jan. 21 was Michael Moran, a chef instructor at the Biscayne Bay Campus School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, which ranks sixth in the nation according to the latest study published in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Education.

Before becoming an instructor at FIU 15 years ago, Moran's career included positions at top restaurants like Windows on the World in New York and Bella Luna in South Miami. He was even an executive chef for King Hussein and Queen Noor in Jordan.

At Macy's, Moran was joined by three of his FIU pastry arts students: undergraduates Mark D'Alessandro, Andrew Lyman and graduate student Christopher Kark.

With their help, Moran worked on his 'Traditional Apple Pie' recipe, giving tips along the way about the dough's consistency and finally giving the audience a taste of his delicious dessert. 

Moran occasionally sprinkled humor into his instructing, further engaging an already captive audience. Lyman then showed what he has learned in Moran's class by preparing a 'Crunchy Cinnamon and Granny Smith Apple Strudel' pastry. 

In all, about 50 people were in attendance, including some of  Moran's former students; Lee Dickson, the associate dean of the School of Hospitality and Gregory Wolfe, former president of FIU. 

D'Alessandro, Kark and Lyman, - all of who have completed culinary school and are now seeking degrees at FIU - spoke about how helpful Moran has been in preparing them for their future careers in education or in restaurant management.

"A lot of very talented chefs in the area around our age and a little bit older, most of them came from his kitchen," Kark said.

D'Alessandro agreed and added, "[Moran] has a very unique demeanor in the classroom that really allows him to connect with students."

Moran explains how he first began his career in the culinary arts field, saying that he chose it as a sophomore over his former major, psychology.

"Food was always an important part of life in my family growing up. It was sort of a natural transition [… it's been a great ride ever since," he said.

Moran credits his time in Jordan as a stepping stone in his career.

"It helped me to know how to push myself to excel, to learn how to deal with managing food, myself and people in all sorts of different situations."

Despite excelling in the kitchen, Moran enjoys giving classes to students on the side.

"It's giving back to the business that's done so much for me and being able to help young people get a good start [… so they can have a successful career," Moran said

Before concluding, Moran encouraged the class to remove all distractions in their own kitchens, take risks and focus on experimenting like scientists. He also reminded everyone that a big part of the purpose of the class was not only to offer practical tips, but also to promote FIU's program - in which students can receive both a B.A. and an M.A. in hospitality management.

Both Moran and his students are looking forward to the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, Feb. 24-26. Organized almost completely by FIU students, the event helps fund scholarships and gives students incredible amounts of experience.
