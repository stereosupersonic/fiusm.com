Headline: Dancing doggies ignite dance floors nationwide
Author: Kim Nguyen / AP  Wire
&nbsp;
Candy normally keeps to herself and doesn't speak up. She stays close to those she knows best and does as she's told. But when she dons her red handkerchief and hits the dance stage, she sheds her reserve.

To Brooks and Dunn's "Boot Scootin' Boogie," she frolics, twirls and, as the country song instructs, does the "heel, toe, do-si-do."

Then she lands a slobbery lick on the face of her partner, owner MaryAnn Fuhrman.

Fuhrman and Candy, a 2-year-old white and fluffy Samoyed, are doing what's known as canine freestyle. In the growing sport, human and dog become a dancing duo, dress in over-the-top costumes and show off their fancy footwork using all six of their legs to songs of all genres, from country to disco to classical masterpieces.

The sport has invaded canine culture in America, including doggie daycares, kennels and boarding facilities. You can see it on YouTube.com and at places such as the National Western Stock Show, where Candy and roughly a dozen women and their dogs performed in front of about 100 cowboy hat-and-boot wearing spectators in January.

Dog owners and their pets don't cut the carpet just for exercise. Many try to perfect their routines to win competitions around the nation and worldwide. 

The competitions are memorable, to say the least.

At the stock show, one woman and her dog dressed in coordinating Denver Broncos gear (the woman in face paint as well), doing their dance as a tribute to fallen football player Darrent Williams. Another woman dressed in red pranced around her toy poodle while Michael Bolton's "Go the Distance" blared from the speakers. During the routine, the woman did splits while her tiny dog jumped over her legs and circled around her.

And at the end of the performances, the women changed into black, red, white, and blue sequined suits, each grabbed an American flag, and did a choreographed dance to Shania Twain's "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" and George M. Cohan's "You're a Grand Old Flag," complete with a giant dog and human spinning pinwheel formation and chorus line of the owners kicking up their legs in unison.

"It's just pure fun. That is the crux of the thing. It's not a stress thing like a showing is," said Fuhrman, 62, of Lakewood, Colo., with Candy wagging her tail and standing by her side. "The dogs enjoy it as much as we (humans) do."

Fuhrman, like lots of canine freestyle dancers, first heard of the sport when she was putting her pets through obedience training. It's there, many say, where doggie dancing got its beginnings in the late 1980s in Canada and Europe, when some people set their competitive obedience routines to music.

"Many people take credit for starting it, but no one has ever actually been called out," said Jessy Gabriel, vice president of dog training at the Triple Crown Dog Academy in Austin, Texas.

Doggie dancing clubs have sprouted around the nation, including the Mile High Musical Tails in Colorado, which has grown from five to 22 members since October 2002, said founder and president, Sue Cianfarani.

While canine freestyle's popularity is rising in the United States, the international scene is already big. It's especially popular in Australia, Holland, Japan and South Africa, said Patie Ventre, the founder of New-York based World Canine Freestyle Organization, which boasts 1,000 members worldwide, and around 5,000 competitors in the events it hosts annually.

She estimates around 15,000 people dance in clubs worldwide, which serve as gathering points for dog owners and the pets and a place where they can polish their dance moves.

Shows like January's National Western Stock show give the dancers a chance to make contact with kids like Madeline McMillan, of Aurora, Colo., 8, who sat in front of the crowd of cowboys and cowgirls and vigilantly watched Candy twirl around her owner and hop on her back.

"I'm going to try to train my dogs turn around when I get homes," said Madeline, who has a 2-year-old dachshund and a 12-week-old golden retriever. "I'm going to tell my friends that I saw tons of dogs dancing - like they really could dance."

Headline: Editorial: BOT should review unanswered questions during final meeting
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Three big questions were left unanswered at the recent Feb. 16 Board of Trustees meeting. Over time, it has been our experience that the board has a short attention span. It has a tendency to raise issues and concerns in one meeting, and then never bring those issues up again.

We urge them to defy that pattern and revisit these questions at their next meeting.

First is FIU President Modesto A. Madique's idea of counting the University's anniversaries starting from 1965, when the University's charter was approved, instead of 1971, the year of the first entering class and the date upon which FIU's anniversaries have been celebrated until now.

It's not clear what Maidique intends to achieve with this, but any guess is as good as ours. We think he wants to make FIU seem older. The logic behind that would be that he is trying to compete with Florida's older, more established universities like the University of Florida and Florida State University.

In principle, Maidique's efforts to make FIU a top contender among the state's research universities make sense. Florida's two top research universities are in the rural north, while South Florida is home to a much larger, more concentrated population. This uneven distribution could put a college education out of the reach of talented but less wealthy residents in urban South Florida, who might be unable to pick up and move across the state to get a top-notch education. Making FIU a big player could solve that.

But changing FIU's age to make it seem more established is letting that effort get out of hand.

Second are the goals Maidique plans to achieve by 2015, FIU's "new" 50th anniversary. He hopes to start a program that would make FIU's curriculum live up to the "international" in its name. That would include adding a second-language requirement and somehow making classes more "international." Apart from being vague, this initiative may have FIU biting off more than it can chew. As Faculty Senate Chair Bruce Hauptli pointed out, FIU already has new law and medical schools and a football program on its plate. FIU would do well to concentrate on developing those programs before it takes on any costly new initiatives.

Third, the board failed to discuss how revenue from the recent $13.20 health fee increase would be spent. The increase was put in place to extend operation hours for the health center, but the extended hours were pulled on Feb. 14. Now that the extra expense is no longer there, the board needs to disclose where the extra money from the increase will go.

The board's next meeting - and its last one for the academic year - will be Apr. 20. This gives them two months to think hard about these three questions. We hope that they remember to follow up on them.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Professor applauds students' mock shanty hut
Author: Phillip, M. Church / Associate Professor, Theatre
&nbsp;
Today I read an article about FIU student and "professional activist" Muhammed Malik and his co-organizers from FIU and UM.

I can only say that, while many student organizations at FIU are to be commended for initiating and supporting a variety of social causes throughout the community, this is one of the rare times that I have been truly moved by the spontaneous show of student support.

I applaud their efforts to call attention to an escalating social blight that no city administrator or polititian seems to be willing to address. 

Discussions, however, on the fate of a baseball stadium for Miami continues to galvanize movers and shakers at a breakneck speed. 

The mere fact that FIU, UM and soon Barry University and MDC are joining forces in a genuine demonstration of compassionate  concern for the homeless in Overtown and Liberty City is one of the most enobling gestures South Florida has received in recent years.

I appeal to fellow faculty members at FIU to help these efforts by encouraging your own students to get active and contact Mr. Malik and volunteer time and resources to this urgent need. And, if it cannot be the shantytown of Umoja Village, then let it be for another equally worthy cause.

Let's face it, there is no will-power like student will-power to make a difference in the world. Mr. Malik, you and your co-workers deserve this University's highest commendation.

Headline: N. KOREA STILL A PROBLEM: Kim Jong Il is armed and possibly dangerous
Author: Jose Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After years of perpetual bartering and constant negotiation, it appears that the United States has finally benefited from its policy of steadfast and persistent diplomacy.

Over the course of a decade, North Korea has conspicuously flaunted its intentions of joining the prestigious "club" of nations possessing nuclear capabilities in both weaponry and energy. However, the perseverance of allied negotiators from the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea, coupled with the promise of vast amounts of financial assistance, have convinced communist dictator Kim Jong Il that it is no longer necessary to realize his ambitions to make North Korea a viable superpower.

As difficult to believe as that may be, it seems to be the case. Time Magazine reports that the agreement states that: "Under the pact, North Korea agreed to shut down within 60 days its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, where it's believed to have produced the fissile material needed to make the 6 to 10 nuclear weapons Kim is estimated to possess. Pyongyang has also promised to allow international inspectors into the country to verify compliance. In return, the North is to receive an emergency shipment of fuel oil from the U.S., China, Russia and South Korea." 

Just how much does this "aid" amount to? According to the Associated Press, the agreement calls for an initial 50,000 tons of oil, or equivalent aid, to be shipped to North Korea once it has been verified that the main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon has been shut down and sealed. Another 950,000 tons of oil, or equivalent aid, is to be distributed once it is confirmed that the North Koreans have irreversibly disabled the reactor.

The question is, will North Korea comply 100 percent with American and allied demands? This is a valid question, considering the years of effort the Koreans put into this program. It took over a decade of labor to conduct thier first nuclear test. 

One also has to consider the failure of the United States to live up to its end of the bargain in the past.In 1994, the Clinton administration proposed an agreement that called for the construction of two light-water nuclear power plants, which would produce nuclear power for North Korea without producing the fissile nuclear material to build bombs.

Before this plan could be implemented, Clinton's presidency came to a close, and the plant sites remain  to this day as evidence of this country's past diplomatic failures.

Another factor that will drive this exhaustive process of finalizing the negotiations is the fact that Kim Jong already has approximately 10 bombs. He has long feared being attacked by the U.S., and now that he possesses these weapons, he is almost  immune to any retaliation.

The fact that the agreement itself states nothing about Kim Jong's current stockpile of weapons is a clear indication that this is by no means the end of the process. This is merely the beginning of a series of negotiations that will either make or break the United States' efforts in disarming North Korea for good. 

Pressures from China and Japan are working toward a favorable outcome.  Both nations are still infuriated over the recent nuclear tests, and are not eager to see a potentially hostile neighbor in possession of weapons capable of inflicting major damage.

The desperation on North Korea's behalf is also apparent. They've  demanded aid to combat the poverty and starvation that is rampant within its borders. In the end, this agreement is a step in the right direction, but it still leaves nuclear weapons in the hands of an unstable dictator.

Headline: Fraternites square-off on soccer field
Author: Christian Guillen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For the second time this season, Sigma Phi Epsilon (2-0) defeated Pi Kappa Phi (0-2) in the intramural soccer fraternity league.

At the start of the second half, senior forward David Casas of Sigma Phi Epsilon dribbled the ball inside the penalty area and scored on a second-post shot.

"I saw the goalie kind of creeping towards the middle," Casas said. "I was thinking he was thinking I was going to cross it because I really didn't have that good of an angle and when he crept up a little bit, I just decided, 'Let me just shoot it at the goal.' That was my best shot, because I had the defender right on me."

Casas' goal would be the only offense generated in the game as both teams' goalies secured their nets.

At the beginning of the game, both teams were trying to organize their strategy by controlling the ball at midfield and holding back their defensive line. 

Both teams took many shots but none were a scoring threat.

"We were just trying to be efficient up front. We knew we were going to have a limited amount of opportunities," Casas said.

The atmosphere was loud as supporters of both fraternities screamed at every player who dribbled the ball and attempted shots on goal.

The first shots on goal were attempted by Pi Kappa Phi forwards freshman Bruno Guerrero and senior John Santella as they advanced their offensive formation and looked more aggressive than Sigma Phi Epsilon. 

"We were trying to keep time on our side and control the tempo of the game," junior defender George Carvajal of Pi Kappa Phi said.

But it was Sigma Phi Epsilon's goalkeeper, freshman Chase Romero, who secured the victory for his team. 

Romero, who had seven important saves throughout the game, was quick enough to reach the ball from every angle and stop every shot taken by Pi Kappa Phi.

"He played great," said junior sweeper Victor Riobueno of Sigma Phi Epsilon. "I think he's Division I caliber."

Sigma Phi Epsilon's mentality changed in the second half, as they attacked more offensively and kept the ball at mid-field, creating more shot opportunities.

A few minutes into the second half, a lob pass by Sigma Phi Epsilon landed on the right side of the penalty area, which was received by Casas and scored the game's only goal. 

"Some of us still had our backs turned. By the time we turned around, they were right in front of me and I tried to get them but before I knew it, it was in the goal," Carvajal said. "Even the goalie was surprised … It caught us by surprise."

Immediately after the score, Sigma Phi Epsilon changed their game philosophy as they closed their defensive line.

"For the last three years, we've been more organized on defense than offense," Riobueno said. "We've always been hard core on defense; we've always worked on defense more than anything."

After the goal, Pi Kappa Phi started to push the game offensively without success. 

They started taking more long shots and were frantically trying to score whenever it was possible, but Romero denied any shot attempts by Pi Kappa Phi. 

During the last minutes of play, Pi Kappa Phi changed their original tempo and became impatient, losing the ball frequently and shooting off target. 

Pi Kappa Phi's next game will be against Tau Kappa Epsilon on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m., while Sigma Phi Epsilon will play against Lambda Chi Alpha on the same night at 9 p.m.

Headline: Athletes afraid to speak up on tough issues
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Honesty may be the best policy. But in the sports world, it may not be the smartest.

Looking at two recent incidents involving NBA players, one former and one current, it's easy to say they should have kept their mouths shut.

The first incident involves Chicago Bulls rookie forward Tyrus Thomas. 

After becoming the first Chicago Bull since 1990 to be invited into this year's Slam Dunk Contest, Thomas stated that the only reason he is participating is for the money.

"I'm just into the free money. That's it. I'll just do whatever when I get out there," Thomas told the Chicago Tribune after he was asked if being around some of the game's greats during All-Star weekend could be beneficial for a rookie.

In response to his comments, the Bulls organization fined him $10,000. 

Then there's the infamous Tim Hardaway situation, which will not be discussed in detail because both you and I are sick of hearing about it. 

But it should be duly noted that his pocket book was hit by the NBA - not with a fine, but for any future endorsement deals or jobs in the media.

There's no question what they both said was stupid. 

And there's no question that their comments showed contempt either for their job or a group of people.

With that said, it has long been a complaint by many fans and members of the media that most athletes are boring interviews. 

Their constant use of cliché and politically correct terminology will do that.

Much like politicians, athletes just aren't candid because they represent an organization and, more importantly, have an image to protect. 

In essence, it all comes down to honesty. 

Athlete's honesty is always in question. 

So what happens when an athlete is honest? 

He or she is vilified. Hell, Tim Hardaway may as well have been put on the FBI's Most Wanted list.

Honesty in sports is a double-edged sword, which is why no baseball player will ever admit to using steroids. 

It's no secret that the only reason Mark McGwire didn't make it into the Hall of Fame was because of suspicion of steroid use, but if he had admitted it, he still wouldn't have been voted in and would have recieved grief from fans. 

Situations like that give no incentive for an athlete to be honest.

We say we want athletes to be honest and candid, but we really don't. 

We just want to be lied to, as terrible as that sounds.

One of the most vocal and opinionated athletes in history, Muhammad Ali, was constantly vilified. 

The public didn't like what he had to say - especially his refusal to serve in the Vietnam War - so he was disliked.

Terrell Owens and Randy Moss are both very candid, but are also denigrated a ton - and covered a ton, too.

On the other side there's Michael Jordan, who is loved by many all around the world. Even after retirement, he is probably still the most marketable athlete on the planet. 

Why? 

Because he keeps his mouth shut on the major topics. 

No one will ever know his opinions on the war in Iraq, George W. Bush, the Enron scandal or anything controversial.

During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Jordan frustrated reporters after repeatedly refusing to comment on the subject. 

That was a very smart move and now, Tiger Woods is following in Jordan's footsteps in that respect: smile, wave, shake hands and keep your opinions to yourself.

Want more proof? Take a look at Ali today. 

The man who was awarded Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Century is almost a shell of his former self because of a long, hard battle with Parkinson's disease. 

But everywhere he goes he is constantly receiving cheers and standing ovations - constant love.

Why? Because now he just smiles, waves, shakes hands and keeps his opinions to himself.

Headline: Golden Panthers sweep Rattlers at home
Author: Roberto Cartagena / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After being swept by Missouri in their first home series of the season, playing Florida A&M (1-11) was just what the baseball team needed.

The Golden Panthers (4-4) came alive in the three game series at University Park Stadium on Feb. 16-17 and outscored the Rattlers 38-15 in a sweep.



FIU 7, FAMU 6



The Golden Panthers survived a sloppy game that included four errors, three balks and two hit batters to come from behind and defeat the Rattlers.

The Rattlers jumped on the Golden Panthers early on to take a 3-0 lead in the third inning. 

Whenever the Golden Panthers scored a run, the Rattlers tacked on more runs.  

Junior first baseman John Petika hit his first homerun of the year in the fourth inning to cut the lead 4-3.

The Rattlers added two unearned runs in the fifth that left the Golden Panthers' trailing 6-3. 

In the fifth and six innings, the Golden Panthers scored two runs, but still trailed the Rattlers.

In the seventh inning, sophomore DePhillip Mason ripped a two out single to right field with the bases loaded, bringing in two runs.

In the eighth inning, senior Walker Whitley was called upon with two men on and one out. 

Whitley struck out the first batter he faced and got the Rattler's Darryl Evans to pop up to first to end the inning. 

Whitley, who got the save, struck out four batters in one and two-thirds innings pitched.

"It felt good to finally win one," Whitley said.



FIU 17, FAMU 7



Up until the seventh inning, either team could have won the game until the Golden Panthers rattled the FAMU pitching staff. 

FIU scored nine runs in the inning, led by a 3-run homerun from senior catcher Cody Jacobs. 

Every Golden Panther got to bat in the inning, causing the Rattlers to use three different pitchers to get out of it.

FIU starting pitcher Chris Allen allowed five runs in five and two-thirds innings of work.

The middle of the Golden Panthers' lineup proved too potent, going a combined 9-for-13 with six RBI.  

Freshman designated hitter Tyler Townsend was perfect at the plate, going 2-for-2 with three walks while junior outfielder James McOwen had a career-high five hits.



FIU 14, FAMU 2

Carrying over from the previous game, the Golden Panthers pounced on the Rattlers early and didn't lose the lead. 

The game ended after seven innings because of the 10-run mercy rule.

Townsend and junior second baseman Corey Lozano hit back-to-back homers, contributing to a six-run first inning. It was Townsend's first homerun of his collegiate career.

"He's done a great job for us," manager Danny Price said. "He had a great Fall. We are not surprised by his performance."

Although sophomore pitcher Jorge Ramos recorded his first win of the season, he was not as sharp as his first start against Missouri. He pitched six innings, walked three batters, gave up two earned runs and struck out five batters . 

Townsend was perfect at the plate again in game two of the Feb. 17 double header, going 3-for-3, with two RBI, a walk and a homerun.

Headline: Men's basketball shocks top ranked Sun Belt Conference foe
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a season that has been characterized by highs and lows, the men's basketball team just may have reached their pinnacle in a matinee contest Feb. 18 at the Pharmed Arena.

Forward Alex Galindo played a familiar role and carried the team on his back, en route to a slim 69-67 win over the University of South Alabama (20-8, 13-3). 

The Golden Panthers' (11-15, 6-10) victory snapped the Jaguars' 13-game winning streak, a run that held the distinction as the second-longest win streak in Division I play.

"It gives us a lot of confidence and we will get more respect now," Galindo said. "I think that all year, defense has been our strength and it keeps us in the game. We wanted to end their streak, and I thought we did it defensively, not offensively."

Galindo, who matched a career high 24 points on 6-of-10 shooting from behind the arc, noted how big the win was for his team.

"It is one of those experiences that you feel like you're in a zone and it was great," he added.

Early on, the Golden Panthers matched the Jaguar offense stride for stride. 

Point guard Michael James aggressively attacked the defensive sets and Galindo buried a pair of jumpers to give the Golden Panthers an early 10-9 lead.

However, the lead was short lived as junior guards Demetric Bennett and Daon Merritt went to work for the Jaguars.

Following sophomore forward Marlon Bright's jumper to pull the Golden Panthers within two at 16-14, Merritt retaliated with a jumper and 3-pointer of his own to extend the Jaguars' lead to seven.

Over the final two minutes, both teams had their struggles from the field before Bennett cashed in on a pair of free throws to put the Golden Panthers in a 34-21 hole at halftime. 

Scoring just seven points in the first half, Galindo made a pair of jumpers, while freshman center Nikola Gacesa showed his versatility with a lay-up in the paint followed by a jumper of his own.

Despite their strong play, the Jaguars showed no signs of slowing down as they opened up a 49-33 advantage off a Stephen Coward 3-pointer with 12:14 remaining in the second half.

Sensing the game slipping away, the Golden Panthers turned to their defense to help get the game within reach.

Led by junior guard Chris Fuller, the Golden Panthers played a spirited stretch of defense that forced the Jaguars to turn the ball over seven times down the stretch. 

Meanwhile, Galindo got some help from freshman point guard Erick Nsangou and Gacesa, who made timely buckets to get them back into contention.

With 29 seconds left, Merritt split a pair from the charity stripe to give the Jaguars a 67-66 lead. 

Following a Golden Panther timeout, James used his quickness to penetrate the lane and find an open Fuller who buried the go-ahead bucket near the top of the key with 13 seconds left.

Junior forward Ernest Little missed a tough lay-up, then James split free throws to lock up the win.

"The play was designed for Alex because he had a great game," said Fuller, who finished with 10 points and four rebounds. "The play broke down for Mike and when he drove and kicked it out to me, I knew that if I got him up in the air with a pump fake I could get it off."

James complimented Galindo with 14 points and six rebounds. 

Nsangou added nine points and six rebounds, while Gacesa chipped in with eight points in the win. 

Bennett, who did the bulk of his damage in the first half, had a team-high 22 points on 8-for-10 shooting from the field. 

The Jaguars shot 55.3 percent from the field, but turned the ball over 20 times, which led to 24 Golden Panther points that proved to be the difference.

The Golden Panthers will play their final home game of the season Feb. 22 against Louisiana-Lafayette at 5:30 p.m.

Headline: NO DIRECTION HOME: Students show solidarity through mock shanty hut
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
Chris Daley's been living a nightmare since May of last year.

A Jamaican immigrant who is studying political science at FIU, Daley says his North Miami-based employer, Furad Industries, refused to pay for his work-related medical bills and fired him from his position as a box lifter.

Due to certain immigration problems, he does not receive financial aid and has to borrow money from his family and friends to pay tuition.

"Coming to school takes away the burden," said Daley, who was elected as president of the political science society Feb. 19. "It alleviates the nightmare."

However, Daley acknowledges that there are some who may be worse off, including residents of Liberty City's Umoja Village.

The village is a collection of about 40 shantytown homes. Many of the residents who live there have been kicked out of their original homes, a controversy that has attracted student activists like Daley.

His first visit to Umoja was Feb. 18 and although he knows Umoja means unity in Swahili, he says the circumstances that led to the commune are the opposite of that sentiment.

"It was a slap in the face with awareness," he said.

But it wasn't until August 2006 that Daley joined Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, one of the FIU groups involved in the protest of creating a mock shantytown hut at FIU.

About 50 students, including those from several South Florida colleges and members of the community, gathered behind the Graham Center at University Park Feb. 18 to begin building the hut.

The modestly built cardboard and wood structure stands just a few feet tall amid the towering buildings on campus.

"We're bringing a glimpse of poverty," said Andrew Santa Lucia, a member of Critical Awareness for Social Inequality in Society. "This is what poverty looks like."

But their means of expression had students like Natalia Valenzuela confused.

"I guess they're trying to make students understand that there are a lot of homeless people out there," Valenzuela said.

However, Meagan McGill ­- who also observed the mock shanty hut - felt she understood what the students were trying to do. 

"The sign says it all," McGill said, referring to the spray painted orange and black phrases on the hut that read, "In every 1st world country there are 3rd world ghettos," and "Less homes = homeless."

Although temperatures dropped as low as 40 degrees and sprinkler water showered the protestors on their first night, several students called the hut home for three consecutive days.

"We've gotten donations of sweaters and food, and I think someone has a heater," said Sonja Swanson, president of the Bolivarian Youth, an activist group on campus.

After their three-day stay, the goods collected were transported to the actual Umoja Village.

There, they hope to use the books they gathered to teach the village residents how to read and possibly obtain GEDs. Toiletries and food are also being collected.

Not even the wood used to build the hut at FIU will be wasted. Swanson said they're going to be re-using all their materials to build a library in the shantytown.

"Everything that we've done has been in complete conjunction with Umoja Village," Santa Lucia said.

Mohammed Malik, A.N.S.W.E.R.'s president, said many students, faculty members and administrators had viewed the project. He said Sonny Wright, a Board of Trustees member, even stopped by to take a look.

"By seeing this demonstration, people are becoming aware of the issue. That's why we're there," Malik said.

The Student Government Association, another group joining the cause, plans to hold a fundraising event March 5. All donations will be given to the Umoja Village.

Gretel Hebbert, who was recently elected to SGA's student services committee, is in charge of the fundraising, and will work through the coming days to plan and advertise the event.

Yet another part of the student's protest includes a petition demanding an investigation against Miami-Dade County. They've collected more than 500 signatures so far, but still need 2,500 more. In an effort to collect those remaining signatures, they're going to keep the hut up until Feb. 23 at 11:59 p.m.

FIU:
Expert on Chinese regionalism and development lectures on the Chinese frontier myth

Timothy Oakes, expert on Chinese regionalism and economic development, will explore the role of the frontier myth in China's national imagination when he lectures at FIU Feb. 22.

As China opens up to international tourism and looks for ways to capitalize on its history and geography, its government is looking for inspiration from the lore of its frontiers. 

Following the country's recent marketing model, dubbed "Open to the West," Oakes will compare China's frontier myth to that of the United State's in the 19th century, during the Wild West experience.  

Oakes's current research, supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, examines the cultural and ethnic politics of heritage tourism in China.

He is also currently co-editing The Cultural Geography Reader together with Patricia Price, an international relations associate professor at FIU.

He serves as visiting professor at the department of sociology at the Guizhou Nationalities Institute, in Guiyang, China. 

The lecture and discussion is sponsored by the Ruth K. & Shepard Broad Educational Series at FIU's Department of International Relations and the Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship Studies. 

The lecture will take place Feb. 22 at 2 p.m. in University Park's MARC building's International Pavilion.

The event is free and open to the public. For more information, call 305-348-7551.



College of Medicine announces first associate executive dean of academic affairs

Officials from the College of Medicine have hired Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, as the college's first associate executive dean of academic affairs. 

Simpson, whose expertise rest in genetic research, will be responsible for the hiring of faculty and helping to lead the college's accreditation process. 

Simpson obtained his medical degree at Duke University and completed post-graduate work at several institutions including Cornell University.

Before coming to FIU, he was a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, where he taught in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics.



FIU first to offer bank compliance certificate

FIU is expected to become the first accredited university in the United States to have an anti-money laundering compliance certificate. 

The program is set to start this Spring and will be a partnership between the College of Business Administration and the Florida International Bankers Association.

It will be similar to anti-money laundering training courses FIBA has offered for several years with its own certificate and they will also be providing instructors and course materials. 

The first classes in the non-credit program are being scheduled at FIU's downtown Miami campus.

LOCAL:
State CFO says helpful program may be in wrong hands

Alex Sink, Florida chief financial officer, wants the popular "My Safe Florida Home" program out of her department and said the agency does not have the expertise to administer it. 

The program, which began last August, had a total budget of $250 million to help Floridians strengthen their homes against hurricanes. 

It provides free home inspections and cash grants of up to $5,000 to homeowners.

The program has drawn criticism because it has not handed out any grants yet, and it has stopped performing home inspections until April. 

But spokeswoman Tara Klimek says those factors are not indicators that the program is having difficulties.

Headline: East meets West in philosophy club
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. and Maria Chercoles / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Last semester, close friends Stephanie Mora and Elizabeth Chang felt they needed a way to share their favorite interest with other students: philosophy. In order to do this, they founded the Philosophies of the East and West club, an organization that encourages students to think about subjects such as the meaning of life and the history of philosophy.

"It's a forum to discuss the wisdom of the ancient civilizations," said Mora, who is club's president. "But you don't need to know anything to join."

According to Mora, the club aims to educate those who have not been exposed to philosophy. Their only requirement is going to club meetings with an open mind.

"I think people can learn from each other," said senior and club member Nelson Abreu. "The club meetings are an opportunity to find the strong and weak points of the different philosophies."

From Buddha to Socrates, Mora or one of the club officers picks out a quote from a philosopher to read aloud.

During their last meeting, Mora picked out a quote from Siddhartha Gautama, the Indian prince who became the Buddha: "What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday. Our thoughts today make our world of the future. Our life is the creation of our mind."

The discussion began afterwards. Most discussions last about two hours.

Club members either debate the issue that was brought up by the quote, or simply talk about the issue, not trying to prove any one side right or wrong.

"Everyone brings their own grain of salt to the table," said sophomore Francisco Surace, who is also a club member.

Other mediums for discussion are also used. 

"People usually bring other quotes and book titles that are relevant to the topics in question and enrich our discussion and learning," Mora said. 

The club's motto is "discover, discuss and compare the wisdom of ancient civilizations" and they specialize in the classics.

"[We stick] to the classics because that way we know we can't go wrong," Mora said.

But the young philosophers don't just keep their discussions within campus walls.

The club, which has about 10 members, is planning a barbeque in March, although an official date and place haven't been set.

The Philosophies of the East and West Club meets the first Thursday of each month in the Graham Center, rooms 343 or 340, depending on room availability.

Their next meeting will be March 1 at 8:40 p.m. The troupe will be discussing Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

For more information, contact Mora at 954-678-7057.

Headline: "Green" buildings in the works
Author: Kelly Poveromo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Sounds like a futuristic movie: environmental friendly buildings that use natural lighting and non-toxic carpet and paint.

Well, think again, because it's not that far from the future. 

This is how FIU could look in a few years, once the new Ad Hoc Building and Environment Committee implements its plan to build "green buildings" at the University.

 Approved last summer by the Faculty Senate, the B.E.C. hopes to change standards of on-campus construction to be more environmentally friendly. 

John Stuart, associate professor in the School of Architecture and chairperson of the B.E.C., describes how the committee came to be.

"Our committee was founded by Bruce Hauptli, the chairman of the Faculty Senate. He formed the committee and said our first task was to look at the master plan of the University-where all the new building and issues of planning the campus were," Stuart said.

The B.E.C.'s official mission includes to review and impact University plans and policies, including the University master plan, as they relate to the physical environment; to educate the community about issues of the University's physical environment; and to receive and distribute funding to pursue its plans.  

After learning their objective, the B.E.C. began deliberating on methods to provide a safe environment for FIU. Ideal methods such as using non-toxic carpet and paint, adding recycling facilities, and using less lighting and air conditioning have all been discussed and are being worked into future construction plans. All buildings with these new standards will be considered "green buildings."

The B.E.C. met Feb. 16 to discuss the current status of the committee. At this meeting, the committee mentioned their goals as of this semester. 

"[We want to] encourage the production of green buildings on campus, encourage non-toxic approaches to landscape maintenance and to follow FIU master plan and building developments," Stuart said.

According to Stuart, these goals will be set towards new buildings such as the stadium expansion and the international studies and medical center buildings. There has also been word of a new "green" residence hall. The B.E.C. has been focusing both on University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

"[In the meeting] we talked about places for students to gather on the Biscayne Bay Campus," Stuart said. "[We want] the Biscayne Bay Campus to be identified as a campus focused on the environment - it has a beautiful setting on the water." 

Since the committee is relatively new and construction of a new building is a lengthy process, students and faculty should not expect to see any "green" buildings for two to three years.

In order to promote these goals, the B.E.C. is planning to create a consciousness campaign, hopefully with the Student Government Association at the lead.

As discussed in their most recent meeting, the consciousness campaign would educate students about on-campus recycling, littering and vandalism.

"We want freshmen coming to FIU to know there is a location on campus to recycle," Stuart said.

This campaign may also make way for the residence halls, especially promoting energy conservation. "It has been cold outside, but still, the windows are closed and the air conditioning is still on in buildings," he said.

For more information on the committee, contact Stuart at 305-348-3178.

Headline: My LIFE! EXPERIENCE: Adult baptism akin to 'righteous party in God's house'
Author: Charlie Grau / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A rock band jamming out, listeners jumping up and down to some groovy tunes and people being dunked in water: sounds like a righteous party, right?

Only if it's a righteous party in God's house.

I had the privilege of witnessing the rebirth of my friend Amanda as she decided to dedicate her life to Jesus; she had invited me to attend her baptism at Dade Christian School on Feb. 1.

Raised Catholic, I only saw babies being baptized, so watching grown adults being dunked into a pool of water was something different for me. When my friend first invited me, I expected that the ceremony would take place outside in a lake, river or pool, similar to how John the Baptist baptized Jesus Christ in the Bible. So there I stood with her family and friends in a school auditorium as she walked across stage. Everyone had already taken the plunge into the depths of the blessed water and now it was her turn.

The pastor muttered a few words and down she went. Although it was only a split second, she gasped for air as if it had been several minutes.

I clapped with the 40 or so other people in attendance, hollering as if I were celebrating a Dolphins victory over the New York Jets.

Perhaps the most unexpected of cheers came from the other baptized people. Growing up, I remember nothing but silence after my sisters were baptized. I'm guessing it wasn't considered appropriate for that type of atmosphere. I guess God didn't like clapping and celebrating in his house.

But the relaxed atmosphere at the school auditorium - serving as a church for the time being - was evident in the way people were dressed. All of the baptisms I had attended had men decked out in three-piece suits with shiny dress shoes while women wore dresses with matching purses and accessories. At Amanda's baptism, however, a few people were dressed semi-formally while the rest in attendance wore shorts, t-shirts and faded jeans with no regard for fashion or impression.

Deacons would often scold new members of my church for wearing hats during mass. Here, one guy wore a Bass Pro Fishing Tournament hat while singing church songs and exclaiming "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!" throughout the service.

All of this was going on while Amanda was being reborn in less than an hour. 

Some people would think that attending a special mass, baptism, communion, baby dedication - whatever you want to call it - would cause an epiphany or allow you to see the light. Yeah, I believe that it's a noble and righteous cause to dedicate your life to Christ or whomever you think is your religious savior, but finding your calling takes more time than a simple dunk in a tub, lake or pool. It takes work and passion to commit one's self to a new lifestyle. Just because you put on a Michael Jordan jersey and some brand-new basketball sneakers doesn't make it the second coming of the greatest basketball player of all time. It takes work, just like any profession does.

I'm not one to preach and impose my beliefs on others. I admit that I'm not the church-going type; I believe in God and try to live my life to the best of my abilities in a way that would please him.

I'm not one to sit down and speak about the Bible and recite passages like Job 4:17; religion should be kept to one's self and only be offered to those who ask for it.

But I have to admit, it did feel nice and relaxing to walk into the Lord's house and witness my friend's baptism. It got me thinking about returning to church until I realized I could just read the Bible myself.

Headline: Graduate school, selectivity contribute to ideal job match
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Your diploma is finally hanging in your room and your loan bills are piling up, which means it's time to start looking for a job. Weeks pass and no luck - you just can't land a job that you like. This scenario has become an unfortunate reality for recent FIU graduate Emilio Gozas.

Gozas vowed never to go to college after high school despite constant arguments with his family. Thinking college was a waste of money and energy, he believed he had the same chances of getting a well-paying job after high school that any person with a degree did.

"I used to think that as long as I was smart and a hard worker, I wouldn't need a stupid piece of paper to tell me what kind of job I should have," Gozas said. "I was so wrong."

After several failed attempts at landing a decent job, Gozas took his family's advice and enrolled at Miami Dade College, later transferring to FIU. He graduated in Spring 2005 with a bachelor's in Business Administration.

"I was so excited to have that stupid piece of paper," Gozas said. "'After all that, I [could] finally get a good job,' I thought."

One of the main goals many want to achieve from attending college is to receive proper training in a specific career so they feel confident in their area of expertise. But the question remains whether jobs will be more accessible post-graduation in both availability and based on a diploma's gravitas. For Gozas, continuing his education seems to be the only solution to his problem, which is exactly what he didn't want in the first place.

"Hopeful employers are telling me the same things they told me when I just had my high school diploma," Gozas said. "And the jobs that do sound enticing to me always end up not paying that much. If I find a job and it doesn't suit me financially, I'm not going to take it."

Money is always an issue when getting a job. Senior Brandon Linton knows this and plans on making the big bucks by attending law school after graduation.

"I am not going to make any money at all as an English major," he said. "I love writing, but I'm willing to turn my passion into a hobby to pay the bills."

Unlike Gozas, senior Kayla Rosales hasn't even graduated and is already close to finding a job that's perfect for her.

"I don't think the job hunt has been that bad for me," she said. "I started looking for a job for post-graduation last year. That's plenty of time, I think."

Rosales, who is majoring in social studies education, refuses to leave Miami after her planned graduation in Summer 2007; she feels that it's the best place to be a teacher.

"Why would I leave Miami when so many schools need more teachers here?" she said.

The reason why Rosales would have a better chance of finding a job than Gozas is because there is a demand for teachers in South Florida, according to Lazaro Rodriguez, an employee of Miami-Dade County Public Schools and an FIU graduate.

"There's [going to be] a need for teachers down here for a long time simply because people keep having kids," Rodriguez said. "Teaching is a stable job that does pay the bills. I like the security I get out of being a teacher."

There might be hope for Rosales as a teacher in Miami, but Gozas is ready to relocate.

"I'm thinking of moving to a place that is a lot less crowded," Gozas said. "I just think I have a better chance of getting a job that appeals to me in a city with less people."

For students and alumni seeking jobs, FIU Career Services offers a variety of services including mock interviews, resume critiques and job fairs. According to Lenroy Jones, director of Career Services, Gozas is not using the proper tools being offered to him in his job hunt. Jones strongly believes that seeking guidance through the center in job searching will drastically raise the chances of landing a desired job.

Located in the Graham Center, room 230, Career Services will be offering various information sessions throughout the semester with companies including Walt Disney World, IBM and Procter & Gamble. Visit their website at www.fiu.edu/~career for more event information.

Headline: THE WRITE Stuff: Literary magazine hopes to relive creative surge of Jazz Age
Author: Silvia Lorenzo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Speakeasies is a new literary magazine on campus and its founder is promising that it will have attitude.

The magazine will feature poetry, essays, fiction and non-fiction stories written by FIU students as well as the artwork of student artists. This magazine encourages different forms of expression or opinions and brings together students across different areas of study.

"The Speakeasies is not associated with any particular school or department," said Alex McAnarney, editor and founder of the magazine. "[The Speakeasies] is an open forum where FIU students can speak their minds easily, and it's free."

McAnarney wants the contents of the magazine to be driven specifically "by the material submitted by students."

As the founder of the magazine, McAnarney will be in charge of creating a presence in the community while looking for funds and resources.

Although publishing the paper would increase cost and require more labor, McAnarney prefers having a real edition come out consistently then posting it on the Internet like the popular trend among bloggers.

According to McAnarney, it's worth it because she's "old school" preferring paper publications to online magazines.

The Speakeasies is raising funds through FIU's Student Organizations  Council and plans to distribute the magazine bi-monthly.

The name "speakeasies" recalls the infamous American underground nightclubs of the 1920s, which allowed people to get together and drink alcohol, illegal due to a constitutional prohibition. Like the underground nightclubs that propelled the artists and writers of the era, The Speakeasies intend to draw attention to the unknown writers or artists in FIU.

"This is a creative outlet where students majoring in international business or African-new world studies can express themselves without having to be a part of the School of Journalism [and Mass Communication]," McAnarney said.

Some students are already excited over the prospect of having a campus literary magazine.

"There is a great demand for a direct students' voice unfiltered by a department at FIU," said Muhammed Malik, a graduate student of religious studies who will run a column emphasizing political awareness.

"Someone might write a conservative view, the next issue may be a liberal response," he said. "The Speakeasies will foster creativity."

McAnarney appreciates the diversity of FIU and wanted the magazine to stress it. She also sees a lack of expression by the students in many FIU classrooms.  She says "students don't speak up, they just sit there and accept what the teacher tells them."

 There is currently one other literary magazine sponsored by FIU.

Gulfstream magazine is a literary magazine that has worked for the past 18 years to expand its readership from local literary fairs, coffee shops and bookstores to a more national level.

Both literary magazines share a mission to raise the voice of its unknown writers. 

"Literary magazines are a vital part of culture especially in South Florida," said Alexis Sanfield, the owner of Luna Star Café, whose independent coffee shop in North Miami regularly hosts literary, music and art events.

"Literary magazines let people know what is going on in a community where everything is so spread out. I'm used to people being more active in their culture, not just the beaches and the malls," Sanfield said.

The magazine's first edition will come out before spring break at University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Headline: Graduate's documentary chronicles unique poetry form
Author: H. Dwight Holmes / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Malachi Smith, an FIU graduate, moved from place to place and faced many challenges as the illegitimate son of a light-skinned preacher. But he found solace through dub-poetry, which he documented in a new film that will be released on Feb. 22.

"I wish society would listen more to dub-poets because what they speak is social consciousness," Smith said. "It represents the reality of everyday life that flies over the heads of many."

Dub-poetry originated in Jamaica in the 1970s. It is a form of performance poetry consisting of spoken word laced over reggae rhythms.

Smith will premiere Dub Poetry: The Life and Work of Malachi Smith at the African American Research Library and Cultural Center in Fort Lauderdale.

"I expect a large turnout and hope it will open eyes to the harsh realities in Jamaica," Smith said. 

He also said the documentary goes into the reality of the aspiring ghetto youth, his trials, tribulations, setbacks, achievements and what he describes as his eventual salvation.

"It looks at longing, betrayal, poverty, loneliness, brutality, oppression, defeat, sacrifice, love and triumph, all through the journeys and eyes of the poet," Smith said.

The documentary film examines an early dub-poetry proponent as a voice of protest and rebellion, while addressing issues of crime and violence, injustice, women, and poverty in Jamaica.  

In the same instance, it chronicles the journey that shaped Smith's life as an artist whose career in law enforcement forms the basis for his most poignant poems. 

"My career [as a police officer] most definitely has influenced my writing in many ways. [The poems] were all written in that blinding moment when reality hit and the senses were blown away, and the self seeks comfort in the arms of words," Smith said.

In the film, Smith's story is told through a series of interviews and performances as he visits various locales in his homeland.

 One stop takes him to the campus of the Jamaica School of Drama in Kingston, where he chats with old friends and the founding members of the dub-poetry group, Poets In Unity.

At another stop, he visits his old police training school in Port Royal, and the place where he first became a police constable, the Barnett Street Police Station.

The JSD is where Smith had his first experience with dub-poetry and began to write at a higher level. However, he started writing before that. While participating in a church Christmas play, Smith realized he had a talent for reciting nursery rhymes.

Smith has done poetry readings for a number of FIU professors, including Carole Boyce Davies, former director of the African New-World Studies program, and Donna Weir-Soley, assistant professor of English who read with him at the Miami Book Fair International.

"Malachi is great to work with. He knows he's good, so he's not insecure and competitive. I also haven't noticed the kind of sexism in him I've seen in other male poets from the Caribbean. He gives a sister her due, so far, and I hope he will continue to be that kind of brother and poet," Weir-Soley said.

Weir-Soley will also do a number of short readings at the event, and will read with Smith again in at a tribute to Jamaican folklorist Miss Lou.

Another performer sharing the stage with Smith and Weir-Soley is Geoffrey Philp, chairman of College Prep at Miami-Dade College.

"I knew about Malachi's work when he was in Jamaica. When he moved to Miami, I invited him to read for my class. At that time, I was teaching Caribbean literature, so it was a natural fit," Philp said.

Smith graduated with a bachelor's in public relations and minored in English. He is now studying criminal justice administration in the graduate program. Presently, he is a Miami-Dade County police officer.

 Although Smith wrote more while at MDC, he said all the places where he learned have influenced, and played a role in his development and maturity.

"I do poetry full time, meaning when I go jogging in the mornings, I write poetry. When I'm at work and images come to me that I can't escape, I recognize them and I write," Smith said.
