Headline: Dolphins, Williams looking for comeback years
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There's nothing in sports like the taste of a brand new season. Hope is aplenty and optimism flows through the air. 

For the Miami Dolphins, coming off a horrendous 4-12 season, a clean slate is exactly what the doctor ordered. Head coach Nick Saban, offensive coordinator Scott Linehan and line coach Hudson Houck lead a new regime that aims to bring the Dolphins back to respectability and eventually NFL dominance. 

However, there's still a large elephant in the room when discussing the 2005 Miami Dolphins: What will become of Ricky Williams, the igniter of all that went wrong last season?

Williams' departure from the team days before training camp last season is well known, so there is no need to get into it. What is relevant now is that he's back. 

With the Dolphins fielding the second worst rushing attack in 2004, one would think his return would be a positive situation, but this is not the same team Williams left a year ago.

The team just made a five-year, $34 million investment in first round pick running back Ronnie Brown. Former Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator Scott Linehan has brought his explosive offensive philosophy to the Dolphins, which enhances the quarterback's role and minimizes the running backs. 

Williams will be suspended for the first four regular season games, giving Brown and the team's other running backs an opportunity to prove their worth. The staff that brought Williams to Miami in 2002 is gone, removing any emotional connection between him and the team.

All things considered, it appears Williams will play out this season with the Dolphins and then be traded elsewhere. 

 He still owes the Dolphins $8.6 million from a lawsuit the Dolphins brought against him for breach of contract and, considering that he will be earning approximately $300,000 this season, logic would suggest Williams would welcome a move to another team where his playing time and income potential would increase. Surprisingly, that doesn't seem to be the case.

Following the Dolphins' preseason loss to Jacksonville on Aug. 13, in which Williams played like his old dominating self, he made some interesting comments. During his postgame interview, he turned around and began questioning the reporters, asking if they thought he would be traded after the season. 

When told that it appeared likely that he would be traded he responded, "I really don't care about the stats or the money. I really like the idea of going through the process of what we're trying to do here."

 Considering just months ago he pledged to never return to the NFL, it's fantastic he's gone from Dave Wannstedt hater to Nick Saban devotee, but his position now seems hypocritical.

Just a year ago Williams effectively flipped off the Dolphins, his teammates, his coaches, the fans and the city of Miami by quitting the week before camp. His departure forced the team to trade star defensive end Adewale Ogunleye to the Bears for mediocre receiver Marty Booker. Ogunleye was in the middle of a contract dispute with the Dolphins at the time. A third-round pick was also sent to the Rams for disappointing running back Lamar Gordon. Bad personnel moves yes but the likelihood is that neither trade would have happened without Williams' abrupt retirement.

He played such a pivotal role in the team's disastrous season and now he claims to want to "go through the process" of what the team is trying to do? 

The Dolphins are in a rebuilding stage largely because of him. An earlier announcement of his return this year would have been more helpful than any statistics he may put up during the season. 

Rather than drafting Brown with the second overall pick, the team could have acquired talented receiver Braylon Edwards or former University of Miami defensive back Antrel Rolle to replace the departed Pat Surtain. Instead, there is a glut in the backfield with Williams likely being the odd man out.

Believe me, I hope Williams stays away from the ganja and has an excellent season. He owes it to Saban and the team as it welcomed him back. 

However, he is not, nor will he ever be, in the position to make a request to stay or be traded. With a new, dedicated regime in place, trading Williams will allow the team to finally get rid of its ties to the negativity that surrounded the 2004 season. 

If and when that happens, Williams should do what he did last year -  quietly pack his bags and move on. The Dolphins would be a better team without him.

Headline: NL wild-card race heating up
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
September is well on its way and the playoff picture is slowly taking shape.  

Division leaders are starting to separate from the rest of the pack, last place teams are being mathematically eliminated and others are slowly being weeded out as they chase down the wild-card in hopes of a spot in the playoffs.

Speaking as part of the minority, I would say the wild-card has actually done great things for baseball. Since its addition in the mid-90s, five wild-card teams have gone on to win the World Series. In fact, every World Series champion since 2001 has come out of the wild-card (the Diamondbacks, Angels, Marlins and Red Sox), and the 2002 World Series featured two wild-card teams - the Giants and Angels.

This year is no different as five teams in the National League are well in the race and are vying for a postseason spot come October.

As of Sept. 8, the Astros held the lead and were a game up on Florida while the Phillies and Nationals are two games and three games behind, respectively. The Mets, after being swept by Atlanta, have fallen down in the race and stand five games back from Houston.

This time of year, teams that do not have solid starting pitching and depth in their bullpen get exposed. That's what it's going to take to separate from this tight race.  

The wild-card leading Astros feature one of the best starting pitching rotations in the league and that alone has carried them to this point. Houston's starting pitchers lead the National League with a 3.43 ERA and feature playoff-experienced veterans throughout its rotation.

The top three pitchers - Roy Oswalt, Roger Clemens and Andy Pettite, are having phenomenal years as each of them holds an ERA under three.

The only reason Houston doesn't lead the division is because they can't seem to get the bats going.  

They are 15th in the league in batting average and 13th in runs scored. Add to that the fact that one of their biggest bats, Jeff Bagwell, has been out all year and it's biggest slugger, Lance Berkman, can't seem to get in the groove. 

With all those factors, you have a team that will miss the playoffs.

The Marlins came into the season having one of the best teams on paper, but have been very inconsistent and now find themselves one game behind the Astros.  

The Marlins have the three-headed monster on their side - Dontrelle Willis, Josh Beckett and A.J. Burnett. These three pitchers carried them in the month of August and need to have a big September if the Marlins are going to make it.

Todd Jones has been the surprise of this team as he has come through in the closers role, with 35 saves and an ERA just over 1.15.  He rounds out a bullpen that seems to be just enough to get by.

The bats do need to get going in September and Juan Pierre will be the catalyst. The speedy centerfielder has disappointed  after two great seasons with the Marlins. He is hitting only .265 with an on-base percentage just over .300.  

He needs to get on base early and often because following him in the lineup will be Luis Castillo, Miguel Cabrera, Carlos Delgado and Juan Encarnacion, all of which have been fabulous lately.

The Phillies lose the top starting pitcher in Kevin Millwood. Jim Thome - cleanup hitter - goes on the disabled list the whole year, and we're talking about them in September?

You could thank the emergence of second baseman Chase Utley, Miami-native Pat Burrell, slugger Bobby Abreu and one of the best bullpens in the league for that.

Starting pitching has also been surprising this season, but I don't think it will be enough to contend with the other top rotations. John Lieber and Vicente Padilla just aren't enough. 

Plus, Ryan Howard cannot carry the load much longer in the cleanup position. The rookie first baseman is not the answer in the middle of that lineup. The team is going to need Jim Thome to come back and play to make that final nudge into the playoffs.

After holding the NL East lead for quite sometime, the Washington Nationals are holding on for dear life in the wild-card race. This is mainly because of a lack of starting pitching.

Nationals ace Livan Hernandez is having a career year, but there seems to be no one after him that can be effective.

The lineup also lacks the power and run production of other teams. The team is 16th in homeruns and RBI's and its number one producer is Jose Guillen with only 24 homeruns and 70 RBI's.  

Lack of  deep starting rotation and lack of run support makes for a bad mix this time of year. I don't think the Nationals have enough firepower to push through the wild-card.

The Mets had one of the biggest offseasons as the team acquired the two biggest free agents in the market - Pedro Martinez and Carlos Beltran. Pedro has silenced all critics and posted great numbers while Carlos Beltran has posted a meager .260 average to go along with only 14 homeruns.

However, the Mets are still alive in the race and manager Willie Randolph has the team playing more aggressive baseball than anybody.

Behind youthful sensations David Wright and Jose Reyes, the Mets are five games out of the wild-card and will rely on their deep starting rotation to carry them through.

Outfielder Mike Cameron is expected back soon and you have to think Carlos Beltran is going to get going. However, problems in the bullpen, especially with closer Braden Looper, are going to keep this team out of it.

In my mind, this wild-card race is going to come down to the two best pitching rotations - the Marlins and Astros.

The Astros have the edge with a schedule that consists of games against Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Chicago; while the Marlins play on the road against teams like Philadelphia and the Mets.

The Astros lineup is still a bit too flaky to carry them through. That's where the Marlins have the edge.  If Pierre can get going for the rest of the guys, they should take the lead from the Astros. 

Houston and Florida meet on Sept. 12 for a four-game series in Houston.

Look for an interesting wild-card chase as the season winds down, especially during the Marlins-Astros series. 

Remember, anything goes and there is a lot of baseball to be played. The next several weeks will be crucial in determining playoff destiny in October.

Headline: Poland native adds experience
Author: Gabriel Medina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This season, the women's volleyball team has imported an outside hitter named Anita Szymanska who thrives on trying new things. 

Born in Tychy, Poland, Szymanska's mother, Barbara Szymanska, enrolled her daughter in a gymnastics class. Volleyball coach Krzystof Palka saw her flexibility and convinced Szymanska to join his volleyball team. The sport grew on the young girl and she remained with that team for eight more years.

After high school, Szymanska attended Oxford University in England - a vast difference from her hometown of two hundred thousand people. Again, she played volleyball for two years and learned the English language during her time there.

However, Szymanska wanted to try something new. Last year, she attended Dodge City Community College in Kansas to play volleyball. There she earned the Dodge City Community College's President's Academic Award after finishing with a 4.0 GPA.

 "Kansas was pretty similar to my hometown," Szymanska said. "There weren't a lot of people and the weather was [similar]."

Szymanska had not quenched her thirst for trying new things. So she went on the Internet and researched various universities at warmer climates. 

FIU sparked her interest, but for once, she was a bit reluctant.

"A lot of my friends [in Kansas] warned me that Miami can be a dangerous city," she said. "I was also scared that the humidity might be a bit much for me. An 80-degree winter is [unbelievable]."

She decided to come to Miami, and she couldn't be any happier. She chose FIU over Maryland, Long Island and South Alabama.

"I love seeing the sunny skies and the clear, blue water at the beach," Szymanska said. "My teammates have also been very helpful and so has my coach [Danijela Tomic]. She is a great coach and I have been able to ask her help in anything, whether it be school, volleyball or life in general."

If one were to look at coach Tomic's life, one would think that she has much in common with her outside hitter. Both  arrived in the United States at about the same age from Europe and they both studied here along with playing volleyball. 

The two are not as similar as it seems, though.

"She studied English at Oxford," said Tomic. "So she knew English when she came to play [in America]. I didn't know a word of English. Besides that, I also had a little more international playing experience when I was her age."

One thing the former assistant coach at Louisiana State University likes about Szymanska is her competitiveness.

"She's a great addition to our team," Tomic said. "And although she is a sophomore, she is the second oldest person on our team, and brings a lot of playing experience from Europe."

The one player older than Szymanska is senior Anna Dmowska - an outside hitter who was born in Poland, as well. Szymanska admitted that having someone to relate with, like Dmowska, really eased her transition to Miami.

During the winter, Szymanska plans to return home and enjoy the snow and the company of her family.

"I love playing in snow, no matter how old I am," she said. "You just can't get that down here."

Szymanska also plans on changing her major from science to international business. But despite all of the changes that the six-foot player goes through, and her thirst for exploring different things in life, one thing remains constant:

"I love volleyball," she said. "It's a very competitive and challenging sport, and I'm very competitive and [welcome] challenges." 

The addition of Szymanska to the team has already proved to be a boost to the Golden Panthers starting lineup. 

At the Over-The-Mountain Invitational Sept. 2-3 in Boiling Springs, North Carolina, Szymanska averaged 15 kills and 11 digs. In the final game of the weekend, Szymanska proved especially difficult to stop with seven kills on nine attacks and no errors.

Subheadline: Fat-burning zone theory has lead to many misunderstandings in the fitness community - graduate student dispels the confusion
Author: Edwin Ryan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The fat-burning zone theory has resulted in a misunderstanding with regards to the right amount of aerobic intensity to bring about the right amount of caloric expenditure. Manufacturers of cardio machines have greatly added to this misunderstanding by labeling the fat-burning zone as a workout option. 

Not only are equipment manufactures not informed about this topic, but many health and fitness professionals use this term in a manner not consistent with exercise physiology. This results in further confusion. I want to clear up some of these misconceptions by presenting the physiology of caloric expenditure and provide advice regarding exercise progression.

Individuals who advocate a fat-burning zone usually suggest an intensity of approximately 50-60 percent of aerobic capacity. A person's aerobic capacity refers to the total amount of oxygen utilized during prolonged activities that uses large muscles (jogging, walking, kick boxing and aerobics).

Burning fat, carbohydrates and proteins is referred to as substrate utilization and is determined by a method called calorimetry. Calorimetric analysis reveals the relative percentage of substrate fuel utilization during aerobic activity.  This analysis found that as the exercise intensity increases, the substrate fuel utilization shifts form a higher percentage of fat to a higher percentage of carbohydrates utilized. This has been the basis of the fat burning myth and initially appears to have some validity. 

However, one should realize that calorimetry identifies the ratio of substrates utilized in terms of percentages. The fat-burning zone theory looses credibility when looking at total calories expended per liter of oxygen. 

Oxygen consumption is measured in liters consumed per minute, and during aerobic exercise, the amount of oxygen consumed determines the caloric expenditure. As exercise intensity increases the percentage of substrate utilization from carbohydrates increases, there is also an increase in total caloric expended per liter of oxygen (Wilmore & Costill, 94). However, when a person is attempting to lose weight, the focus should be the total number of calories expended.

LaForge and Kosich demonstrated how a higher percentage of fat vs. carbohydrate utilization during aerobic exercise can be misleading in the following example. If an individual with an approximate oxygen uptake of 49 liters per minute, exercises for 60 minutes at 50 and 70 percent of aerobic capacity. At 50 percent, their oxygen consumption demonstrated that approximately 480 total calories were expended with 240 calories coming from fat and 240 coming from carbohydrates. At 70 percent of aerobic capacity, the total caloric expenditure was 660 calories with only 264 coming from fat and 396 from carbohydrate.  

This demonstrates that even though the percentage of calories burned from fat are less than the calories burned from carbohydrates, at 70 percent of aerobic capacity they are more than the number of fat calories burned at 50 percent. 

In other words, the higher the intensity, the more calories burned - regardless of the amount of expended calories from carbohydrates. We all know that a higher percentage does not always mean more. Therefore, by virtue of total caloric expenditure, high intensity exercise is more effective at caloric expenditure, in a given time.  

Having said this, it should be mentioned that high intensity exercise must be approached in a prudent manner. If this is not done, this information (though correct) may be inappropriate. 

High-intensity exercise is difficult and should be progressively increased into one's program. Adequate rest as well as consideration of muscle/joint injury and overall health is important when deciding on how to appropriately include high intensity exercise. Additionally, high intensity exercise is difficult to maintain over a long period and should be interspersed with lower intensity workouts. This would help to decrease the likelihood of dropping and enhance exercise compliance when prudently applied. 

A person can still expend calories when working at lower intensities but for longer durations. Therefore, if weight management is a concern, you are new to exercise, you have muscle and joint concerns, and time is not a factor, low intensity exercise may be more appropriate. 

However, if you want to maximize caloric expenditure in a time efficient manner, and you have no health or muscle/joint concerns, including high intensity aerobic exercise may be more useful. Nevertheless, staying at low-intensity levels because of the belief that more fat will be burned is incorrect.

Headline: "The Simpsons" DVD box-set: A fantastic collector's item for everyone
Author: Sergio Carmona / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The four disc DVD box-set of "The Simpsons" season six contains episodes of the 1994-95 season that had a level of hilarity matched by only a handful of seasons - and perhaps topped only by the fourth and fifth. As usual, this season is full of guest stars, including Meryl Streep, Patrick Stewart, Susan Sarandon, Jon Lovitz, Tito Puente and many more. However, the precise dose of satire that the 24 episodes possess is the strong suit of these episodes. 

This season contained the landmark episode "Who Shot Mr. Burns" Part I, being the first two-part episode and only two-parter to date that the satire has produced. It is a series of situations where Mr. Burns angers certain citizens in Springfield for different particularly vile acts, including Homer for not remembering his name. 

Some of the more bizarre, amusing, disturbing and ironically twisted situations include Homer becoming the leader of an underground society that contains virtually every male adult in Springfield. They sing a clever song and claim they're behind the absurdities of society. There are many more situations that are equally silly, yet intelligent, in this season. 

As for special features, the episode commentaries are a great way to learn the origin of each episode and the development process which creators  seemed to have a lot of fun with.  The creative team mentions its influences for the episodes, and the fun it had with the animation and chemistry of their talented actors. Perhaps the best commentary is the one for the "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" episode, because the creators give clues throughout the whole episode.

The rest of the features contain animatic, animation showcase, illustrated commentary and original sketches - which are great features for aspiring animators; funny gag commercials; an entertaining America's Most Wanted special entitled "Springfield's Most Wanted" covering the mystery behind Mr. Burns's culprit; and funny suspect profiles with descriptions of each character who could've shot Mr. Burns. Their description and details make even the most unmotivated suspect look like the guilty culprit.

Despite the box set being the shape of Homer's head, the exterior of this collector's item is far outweighed by the excellent treats that await you inside.

Headline: [Adult Swim]
Subheadline: A wad of meat, a winged lawyer and a one-eyed alien make cartoon watchers out of college students 
Author: Stephanie Machado /Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As I lie in my room focusing on my Anglo-Saxon literature assignment, I glance at the clock and see it is 10:55 p.m. "Shazzam!" exclaim my insides, "almost time for Adult Swim." 

I am certain that this is a familiar scene for many students out there, or at least the cool ones. For the rest of you, or who I like to call the "Un-hip," worry not, this un-hippness can be cured. You probably just haven't heard of Adult Swim. 

If you have heard about it and you still don't like it, well then you are either an idiot with no trace of a sense of humor, or you are an 80-year-old immigrant who doesn't speak English. For the sect of The Un-hip who simply haven't heard about Adult Swim here is the skinny on it: Adult Swim is a programming block on Cartoon Network that airs Saturday through Thursday starting at 11:00 p.m. 

This is practically the only place where one could watch old "Futurama" episodes, along with "Family Guy," and several Adult Swim original shows. 

These original shows include the popular "Aqua Teen Hunger Force." This show was originally about a milk shake named Master Shake, a box of French fries, named Frylock and a wad of uncooked meat appropriately named Meatwad, who fight crime in New Jersey. If you are thinking to yourself, "Hey wait a minute, food can't fight crime!" give yourself a gold star. 

Food isn't usually superheroes - and neither is it in this show after the first two episodes. 

For the later episodes, the trio just hangs out trying to pay their bills, however they do encounter many zany characters, such as a giant spider named Willie Nelson who lives in their attic; the robot ghost of Christmas past from the future; and the popular, and sheer genius, Mooninites, who come from the Moon where it rocks. And let us not forget about the ever-annoyed neighbor, Carl, who always seems to get the short end of the stick.

Although it is said it was due to the DVD sales, I am convinced that Adult Swim is greatly responsible for getting "Family Guy" picked up again on FOX. After the show was cancelled, Adult Swim was the only way you could watch syndicated episodes, the incredible ratings prompted DVD sales, and now you can see new episodes of "Family Guy" on FOX on Sundays at 9:30 p.m., and the old ones on Adult Swim. 

For all of you  hoping and praying that "Futurama" will have the same fate, there is some glimmer of hope. At Comic-Con International in San Diego, Matt Groening, creator of "Futurama," announced that three "Futurama" movies will be released straight to DVD. So if those sales go well, we shall  hopefully be able to continue the story of Fry, Leela, Bender, Hermes, Zoidberg, Amy and the Professor very soon.  

Adult Swim has something for everyone. If you're a big fan of the classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons, then "Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law," is perfect for you. Watch as former superhero, Harvey Birdman, tries to climb the ladder at a fancy law firm by defending former stars of Hanna-Barbera cartoons. 

Some of these include Fred Flintstone as a mob boss, Ricochet Rabbit in a Ritalin suit and Dr. Quest in a custody suit over Hadji. This show is sheer brilliance. 

As the years have passed, Adult Swim's popularity has grown immensely among college kids. With all new shows coming out like "Stroker and Hoop" and "Robot Chicken," and with talks of Adult Swim branching out into its own network, it seems as if the Adult Swim phenomenon won't fade away any time soon. 

So check out Adult Swim and get rid of that stench of un-hippness, and for the rest of you, stay cool and keep watching.

Subheadline: Parking problem due to increased number in student body
Author: Editorial Board
&nbsp;
It's true that FIU's parking situation gets worse at the beginning of every Fall and Spring semester and even now, the Summer semesters are starting to get uncomfortably crowded, but even with the addition of the two gaudy monstrosities known as the Red and Orange Parking Garages, the problem has not seen any resolutions. 

FIU is a commuter school, so why would the biggest class of incoming freshmen so far be admitted? The freshman class has a high number of commuters, meaning the parking situation has severely worsened.

Other state universities have parking problems, but it matters more at FIU since the university enrollment consists of a majority of commuter students, not residential.

This parking drum has been beaten to death, brought back to life and beaten to death again. The cause for so much commotion is because it has already become an epidemic, an infestation if you will, of people. No, it's not a disease, but it might as well be.

Granted, the situation does get better about a month into the semester due to students dropping and skipping classes, but is this what FIU wants? - to slowly phase out the commuter students? It is known that FIU's ultimate dream is to have a majority of on-campus dwellers, but the reality of it is the university is a commuter school and will be for quite some time. Will FIU continue to enroll larger freshman classes, knowing that the parking situation will worsen?

 It has come to a point that, out of sheer loss of patience to wait 30 minutes to find parking, students are parking across the street at Wendy's, Publix, etc.  So what are we doing in terms of bettering the parking situation? All we have as an answer are two new measly parking garages for a 10 percent increase of student body.

Headline: Slavery: Not a thing of the past
Subheadline: Slavery lingers in today's world as a profitable underground business
Author: German Silverio / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As long as we never forget the American Civil War, we'll be able to utter the word "slavery," and as long as we don't forget about the African continent, we'll continue to know where most American slaves came from. 

When we think of slavery, we think of it as an issue based on the chronology of American history, and thus deem it an issue long resolved two centuries ago, and not only in the United States, but in the rest of the world as well. 

Slavery, by no means whatsoever met its end in 1865. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), it is still a condition which plagues 12.3 million people today, and one  largely ignored by mainstream Western societies. 

We rightfully think of it as a barbaric practice, but we also think of it as an issue from the past, which sadly renders us ignorant of the existence of those 12.3 million men, women and children. 

Recognizing the existence of modern slavery is equally as important as purging oneself of the stereotypes that surround the issue by considering how slavery does not only affect Africans. In fact, according to the ILO report (titled A Global Alliance Against Labor), the majority of cases occur in poor Asian and Latin American countries, while a staggering 350,000 cases have been reported in the industrialized world. 

In light of this, it would be simply idiotic to dismiss this issue as one from the past and of a continent we consider so alien to us. 

Of the total number of slaves, the ILO estimates that about 2.4 million of them are victims of trafficking, and their labor generates profits of over $30 billion. 

As a result slavery has become a large underground business, and consequently needs a source of merchandise. Human trafficking more often occurs in war-torn countries and conflict zones, where order is usually limited and where law enforcement is slack and often corrupt. 

In the case of Europe, the ILO commented that "... Albania, the Republic of Moldova, Romania and Ukraine have been identified as important source countries of trafficked victims."

Those people who fall under the modern category of slaves are not necessarily limited to agricultural or domestic service; a large number of women and children are also forced into prostitution or sexual exploitation. 

In Niger, where the practice of slavery was outlawed in 2004, a study found that almost 8 percent of the population are still slaves, and that the practice of slavery continues through what is called 'bonded labor," in which children are forced to do the same jobs as their parents, without any hope of release. 

If you do the math, that means over a 100,000 people in Niger will wake up tomorrow without having any control of their lives.

These are sobering facts. Slavery is not as bad today as it was a hundred years ago, and it faces more opposition than ever before. 

Nevertheless, while in the West we believe in the fallacy that we ended slavery, we will continue to forget that we have yet to entirely eradicate it in developing nations. But, for the sake of 12.3 million slaves, we simply cannot afford to forget.

Headline: Title V grant: Steady source of funding
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
Almost four years since a Title V grant worth $2.1 million was awarded to FIU, the university has used the money to expand student services. With the recent budget problems FIU has encountered, the Title V grant has provided a steady source of funding for the university.

FIU has allocated the money into three areas: The Freshman Interest Group Program, faculty development and student support services such as orientation, advisement and online services. Awarded to the university in October 2001, the grant was distributed $400,000 per year.

Created in 1998, Title V is a Hispanic-serving five-year federal grant program. The program requires over 25 percent of Hispanic student enrollment and no less than 50 percent of those students be low-income students. 

"Our grant is to help our Hispanic and low income students succeed at FIU," said Lourdes Acevedo, coordinator of Title V. "We looked at areas we feel are important, for example, orientation and advising - so students start right."

"The idea is to provide money from the U.S. Department of Education to all Hispanic serving institutions and, we have approximately 53-54 percent. So we more than meet the minimum expectation," said Jorge Diaz, Title V director.

The grant has been used to expand and improve existing programs, such as  freshman interest groups. 

"We have been paying a lot of attention at the first semester at FIU and [we are] doing everything we can to improve student success Title V allowed us to take things we knew were working and expand it to larger populations," said Jeffrey Knapp, director of the FIG program and English professor. 

"We had challenges to bring a program that would work as far as increasing student persistence, improving student-per-semester grades, and demonstrating higher student satisfaction level to [aid] at-risk students who come into our summer session. The first semester transmission experience is often a large one," Knapp added. 

Specifically, the money has been used to pay professors, peer mentors and website upgrades along with lab software. 

"Professors are getting paid [up to] a  $500 stipend," Diaz said.

According to Knapp, there are a lot of challenges that Title V addresses, such as faculty development. 

"We began to use only full-time faculty. Obviously if we are starting a program for students coming in Summer B semester, we become more reliant on part-time faculty, who don't have the evaluation process that full-time faculty has as part of their contract with the university," he said.

Once the five years are over, the programs expanded by Title V are expected to continue by means of additional funding.

According to Rosa Jones, vice president of student affairs and undergraduate education, the first option is to receive funding from the institution so that funding is constant, otherwise, federal funding will be sought.

"Once the dollars are over, [in order] to continue efforts, [we will] seek additional funding, in terms of federal grants," Jones said.

Some of the online innovations as a result of the Title V project include online orientation for transfer business students and mandatory orientation for all transfer students. 

During the summer of 2006, the College of Arts and Sciences will unite with the rest of the colleges in the mandatory transfer orientation. It was the only school that did not have mandatory orientation for transfer students this summer. 

Title V will hold a public forum "Title V Initiatives: Opportunities for Collaboration" Sept. 16 at 8:30 a.m. in the Graham Center East Ballroom. All  faculty and staff involved in the Title V are invited to the forum. Students  and members of the community are encouraged to attend. 

The event will be "an opportunity to [publicize] the grant," Jones said.

Research will be presented to members of other departments in the university to inspire collaboration and involvement in the program.

Headline: Class of 2009 concerned with professors, peers
Author: Begone Cazalis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After four-years of academic slavery, freshmen are set free to wander the halls at the Biscayne Bay Campus. Some freshmen overcome the transition from high school to college with the courage a young bird holds when taking its first flight, while others lose their way through the jungles of registration and financial aid.

Alysia Munis plans to obtain a degree in nursing, but has mixed feelings about her first-year college experience.

"It's really exciting, but a little scary too, just because in high school everything is spoon fed to you and now you are basically on your own," Munis said.

Every year, thousands of freshmen attend orientation for two days to prepare for the academic years to come.

During summer's orientation, students received information from peer advisors, administrators and professors on how to make the best of their college experience.

This year, most students found orientation helpful and fun, although some found the it to drag on.

"Orientation was somewhat boring, but necessary. However, I do think that there are a lot of things that were repeated way too many times, and other things that just weren't necessary, these things just wasted a great deal of time," said journalism major Veronica Jovanovich.

Not only will students learn how to work Panthersoft - an internet program, which, among many things, allows students to register for courses and pay tuition online - orientation attempts to shine a light on many of the situations that may affect students throughout their career at FIU.

Even though the majority of students were reunited with several high school classmates, students like Munis are ready to make new friends.

"I think the only thing I would change is to give people more of a chance to meet other students," Munis said about her orientation experience.

The fact that teachers are now referred to as professors tends to be another issue present in the transition from high school to college.

In high school, stories about college professors who give out grades based on just two exams, or who lock the door to keep late-comers out, circulate the halls. But most students at BBC like Nahima Dominquez, who  is majoring in marine biology, found the professors very helpful.

"The teachers were great, and they really helped me improve and prepare myself for college," Dominquez said.

Other students feel that college is a challenge where they will approach their studies with more effort than they did in high school.

"I studied an average time because high school is not half what college is. On the other hand, I expect a lot of dedication in college because my career goal is complex," said biology major Liz Gonzales. 

Although most students are hoping to party a lot more in college, they are also concerned with time management.

"I definitely think there is going to be more partying going on during my college years," said communications major Bertha Alis. "I just have to learn how to manage my time. I am learning little by little that it's not like high school and that I need to do everything on my own."

"I've always been eager to see what the future holds for me, and I love challenges because college is no joke," Gonzales said. "Responsibilities come along with freedom and time management is very important. I feel excited to have the opportunity of living a new chapter in my life that I am sure will bring me lifelong relations."

Headline: Internships prove valuable for students
Subheadline: PART-TWO OF A TWO-PART SERIES
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Walking back and forth in a first-year experience class, recruiter Jaime Rivera called on students, shook hands and eloquently acted out interview situations in which prospective interns could find themselves.

Rivera knew that everyone in the room should obtain an internship before graduating.

"Don't think about graduating from this fine institution without an internship," Rivera said to an audience of mostly freshmen at Biscayne Bay Campus this summer.

Rivera encouraged everyone to go online and apply for Inroads, an agency that places qualified students into paid internships with major companies such as IBM and General Electronics.

But he made no secret of the fact that the agency gives preference to recruiting minority students.

"Our mission is to develop and place talented minority youth in business and industry and prepare them for corporate and community leadership," he said.

Inroads's motto is part of a widespread philosophy promoting diversity  in the workplace.

While this philosophy has drawn praise, it has also created controversy.

In fact, for some time now, American universities and companies have been accused of reverse discrimination, which means choosing people based on minority status rather than on talent, in order to fulfill a diversity quota for affirmative action. Lawsuits have led the U.S. Supreme Court to rule quotas in student bodies unconstitutional.

Meanwhile, Ivette Duarte, internship coordinator at FIU, defends the idea that students should take advantage of whatever sets them apart from the competition.

"You have to find your niche in the world and find your way in," Duarte said. "Then you can prove yourself."

In order to help students find their way through the internship and career maze, Duarte sets up career fairs on campus and attends conferences elsewhere. According to Duarte, 30 to 50 percent of the federal workforce will be retiring by the year 2007, which will open up slots for almost two million new employees.

That is, Duarte predicts, because the government has struggled to establish a percentage of ethnicities in the workforce comparable to the U.S. population.

According to Duarte, through agencies such as the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) the government seeks to recruit minorities to boost representation of different ethnicities and make an impact with its constituency.

But the debate on affirmative action continues.

In 2003, The New York Times had to deal with the chagrin of Jayson Blair - a young African American who had become one of the stars in the newspaper's minority-only internship program - only to burn out ferociously.

As an intern with The Times highly selective program in 1999, Blair quickly ascended and broke into the national scene as a full-time reporter, covering high-profile stories such as that of Pvt. Jessica Lynch and the Washington D.C. sniper.

When The New York Times found out Blair had made up and plagiarized information in dozens of his articles, it immediately fired him and ran extensive corrections as well as a large article pinpointing  his errors in detail, but also describing his writing ability and impressive eagerness. 

Sheila Rule, the senior editor who's in charge of internships at The Times, said that race is not a deciding factor and that the newspaper opened up its internship program for everybody five years ago, before the scandal broke out.

"We like to see a range of skills," Rule said. "And although we're always striving for a more diverse newsroom, being a person of color won't help you if you don't have that."

Statistics show that lack of experience is indeed a problem, pointing out that 70 percent of employers require applicants to have had a previous internship. For this and other reasons, although some departments at FIU don't require internships for graduation, Duarte suggests every student should complete one.

"An internship - or multiple internships - would help them remain focused on education and give them a competitive edge," Duarte said.

More statistics point to the positive contributions of internships. Close to 82 percent of interns get offers from employers with which they intern, and 65 percent of these offers are good enough for the interns to accept, Duarte said.

In addition, between 1983 and 1999, 84.4 percent of FIU students who had an internship not only graduated, but also completed their programs faster than the average student, according to Duarte. 

"Start early," Duarte advised. "Do multiple internships. Prepare early. There's a world out there waiting to happen, waiting to be discovered."

The next career fair, featuring over 130 companies, will be held Sept. 13 at the Pharmed Arena located at University Park. For more information on the fair and other career services at FIU, visit their website at http://www.fiu.edu/~career/.

Headline: Architecture School drafts merger proposal
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Fourteen months ago, Adam Drisin came aboard as the new director of the architecture program for FIU's School of Architecture, drawn to the diversity of the Miami region and the program's rising stardom.

"It's been an extraordinary 14 months,"  Drisin said.

"Extraordinary" may be putting it mildly. Within the past year, the School of Architecture has seen a massive increase in graduate enrollment and two of its students won prestigious awards in architecture. A big change may be in store for the school - plans to incorporate it into the College of Arts & Sciences are being discussed. 

A memo from the university in March of 2005 records a proposal to create a new College of Fine Arts within the College of Arts & Sciences during the Fall 2005 semester. The new college would incorporate the previously unaffiliated School of Architecture, as well as the Schools of Art and Art History, the School of Music, the School of Theatre, the School of  Dance, the Speech Communication Program and the Patricia and Philip Frost Art Museum under the College of Art.

Even though at this time it is uncertain when, or even if, the merger will take place, Drisin sees a lot of positives.

 "Architecture has always been a profession that balances the arts, the humanities and the sciences," Drisin said. "The idea of this unit now being aligned with those other units that have for centuries been related to architecture is profoundly interesting and ripe with possibilities."  

"I really think it's a great opportunity for the arts to collaborate," said Juan Antonio Bueno, dean of the School of Architecture. "It can definitely enhance the education of the arts and architecture student.  But I think we have a lot to offer in the arts component of a liberal education for the whole university."  

The School of Architecture is currently a separate school with its own dean, and consists of three units: architecture, interior design and landscape architecture.  

"Even though our title is 'the School of Architecture,' we're actually a cross-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary school that consists of three design disciplines,"  Drisin said. "We will remain as such, with this new merge."

In the meantime, there are other noteworthy developments. Drisin commented that the School of Architecture has a long tradition of involvement with study abroad programs, and has sent students to Spain and Rome.  

"We've just started a very exciting program in Genoa, Italy," Drisin said.  "I think this will allow for some interesting future opportunities both for students and for faculty. I've always been a big believer in study abroad, not just for students to go over there and learn about another culture. I think that 49 percent of the value of student travel is to be able to see your own home in a different way."

FIU is also gaining recognition through the award-winning achievements of its students. Drisin cites the awarding of the prestigious Unbult Architecture Award to one of the school's graduate students - an honor traditionally given to graduates of northeastern schools.

"The other award that one of our students won this year was the Van Alen Institute Design Competition Award.  The Van Allen Institute is another one of these northeast organizations that sponsors design competitions. One of our undergraduate graduating students won this competition with her submission to a design competition for the redesign of the Parachute Pavilion in Coney Island. She beat out over 800 entries for this competition. There were four awards given, and she was the only student of architecture out of any of the winners," Drisin said.

Additionally, the School of Architecture's graduate program is expanding dramatically, with student enrollment in its graduate program increasing by approximately 60 percent over the past year.  

"I think that kind of growth suggests a very healthy future for the architecture program and the school as well," Drisin said.

Graduate program coordinator Rasiel Cardentey said that a new interior design master's program is currently in the works, with a possible commencement date in Spring 2006.  It will be the third Master's Program for the School of Architecture. 

"We're very excited about [the planned interior design master program]," Cardentey said.  "It should be strong, as the other two are, and they've done fairly well."

Headline: Frost Art Museum sets completion for 2007
Author: Luisa Cabrera and C. Joel Marino / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
The large skeleton shape of the new Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum has been slowly rising for the last few months on a strip of land on the University Park campus, becoming a part of FIU's planned "Avenue of the Arts" while fulfilling a 15-year journey for those involved with the museum's long history.

"It has taken a long time," said Stacey De La Grana, the museum's acting director. "We're finally realizing this dream ... It will be the prettiest museum in the city."

Construction on the 46,000 sq. foot premise began last fall and has continued throughout the Spring and Summer semesters. The grand opening is set for 2007, with many hoping that the new cultural center will help FIU achieve many of its goals.

"We are a step further toward realizing the goal set by President [Modesto] Maidique, and Dr. and Mrs. Frost - to create a 'jewel' at the center of the FIU campus," said Yan Weymouth, the building's architect, in a press release published earlier this year.

The project has cost an estimated $17 million, with funds being raised in the last decade through donations from wealthy patrons and matching Florida government grants. Despite the many years it has taken the museum staff and art department to accumulate the money, some feel the wait will be well worth it.

"We're going to be a state-of-the-art institution, nationally and internationally recognized," De La Grana said. "We will be able to compete with other institutions within the city and within the region."

De La Grana's vision for the museum includes community outreach programs, a lecture series and a separate critic's lecture function to attract community artists and authors.

The building itself will house 10,000 sq. feet of gallery space with over nine different galleries spread out on the second and third floors. The museum will house a café, a merchandise center, sculpture and meditation gardens. It will also include such permanent collections as the Oscar B. Cintas Fellowship Foundation Collection and the Cuban Diaspora Collection that has belonged to the museum since 1989.

The current Frost Art Museum occupies a space on the first floor of the Primera Casa building. However, plans for that particular area remain uncertain.

"We were able to do some fantastic exhibits there," said Daune Brant, the museum's exhibition designer. "But we've outgrown the space."

The original museum was established in 1977 and received full accreditation from the American Association of Museums in 1999. Named after Patricia Frost (a member of the FIU Foundation Board) and Phillip Frost (one of the original members of the university's board of trustees), the museum has been home to 160 exhibitions since it was founded. It has also been named South Florida's best art museum three times by the Miami New Times.
