&nbsp;
Hello my name is Jennifer Fransen and I wanted to recommend the CLDP (Collegiate Leadership Development Program) to have a story/article written in the next upcoming issue of The Beacon. It's an excellent program. We are learning many different aspects of leadership and what it takes to become a better leader. 
We also have about 1-3 speakers, who are FIU admninstrators, Provosts, Deans or are very influential here at FIU. 

This is the 5th Annual Year that this program takes place and has won numerous awards by the state and even nationwide I believe. We have students in the program that are freshman all the way to Graduate STudents. If there is anything I can do to help facilitate you all on your staff to make the article possible please let me know. I would like to make the CLDP Program aware to students here at FIU and let them know about this great opportunity.

Thank You,
Jennifer Fransen

Headline: Shaq expected to boost Heat, add humor
Author: Harry Coleman / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
As I walked through the hallways of the Graham Center last week, all the buzz was about the world's biggest, most dominant superstar, who just happened to land in Miami last week.

Shaquille O'Neal's arrival to Miami automatically makes him the biggest athlete the city has ever had. While Dan Marino was a local favorite, he is not even as big as Shaq's right bicep worldwide. Shaq is also bigger than David Beckham, even with his styled hair, or Tiger Woods with his Nike golf sticks.

The 360-pound 7'1" basketball player is expected to make the Heat something they have never been before. From exposure on the nightly telecasts on ESPN to nationally televised games on TNT and ABC, Shaq will make a Heat game the hottest ticket in town.

The most notable numbers Shaq has over the entire Heat franchise include 11 playoff appearances while the team has had nine in history.  What about the 40-point games?  O'Neal has had 47.  The Heat: 12.

 Some say the Heat gave up too much for Shaq, but in reality, they didn't. The Lakers are getting a beat up General in Brian Grant, a mediocre forward in Caron Butler, a positive-testing drug abuser back with the Los Angeles Clippers in Lamar Odom and a future first round pick (in which won't be top 25) if the Heat advance deep in the playoffs with O'Neal. 

Not only will Shaq score 30 points a game, but he will also make you laugh too. He once called the Sacramento Kings the Sacramento "Queens" in a press conference after a game. When Shaq was driving his car, he stopped to talk to a reporter and when one asked where Shaq got his new hat, O'Neal paused and said, "from your mom." 

How can you not laugh?  When O'Neal heard that Houston Rockets Center Yao Ming wanted to play against him, Shaq said, "You tell Yao Ming, Ching-chong-yang-wah-ah-soh."

Shaq has also been known to give different nicknames for himself. He has called himself the Big Aristotle, Big Daddy, the Diesel, Superman, and Will Chamberlinni, in honor of the great center that once scored 100 points in a single game.

None of these nicknames are as controversial and funny as the nickname he gave himself during playoff stretches. 

When center Luk Longley lost to Shaq, he returned to Australia. Center Rik Smits lost to Shaq and returned to Holland. Center Arvydas Sabonis lost to Shaq and returned to Lithuania. As all these players returned to their native countries, Shaq called himself the Big Deporter.

In a recent exclusive interview on ESPN, Shaq called himself a "Big Body Benz sitting on 24's with crome spinning black on black." He said that everyone knows that a Mercedez Benz is no BMW, and that he is no BMW, Volkswagon or Truck.  

He claims to be a Benz on I-95 driving to Miami in order to take care of business. These are the kinds of thing you can say when there is no one in the NBA that can guard you or even stop you for two minutes.

O'Neal's arrival in Miami is so big that the deal would have sounded right even if the Florida Marlins would have sent Josh Beckett, the Dolphins' Ricky Williams, and FIU would have sent new basketball Head coach Sergio Rouco along with the package.

The Miami Heat stated that it has already sold all lower bowl seats for the upcoming season. 

O'Neal jerseys are already selling like hot bread online and everyone seems to have forgotten about the Miami Dolphins or the recent World Series champs.

Heat fans everywhere will now be waiting for the NBA season to start like never before.  If you're wondering what Shaq has dubbed himself as a Miami Heat player, he said, "I'm a Heat," during his interview on ESPN.  However, it didn't sound quite right to him so he hesitated and rephrased his statement by saying, "I'm a Heatenin.  Is that a word?"  Shaq, you can say whatever you want.

Headline: With training camp kicking off Aug. 8, Don Strock and his Golden Panthers find themselves with three quarterbacks battling for the starting spot.
Author: Andres Cordero  / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In the 2003 season opener starting, quarterback Jamie Burke, who left the final game of the previous campaign with a dislocated shoulder, went down with a torn ACL that required season-ending surgery. Burke is expected back by the start of training camp and now the starting quarterback position is up for grabs.

 Having started 11 games and racking up 1,652 yards and 14 touchdowns in 2002, Burke will open training camp fighting to win back the starting job from third-year sophomore Josh Padrick who when called upon last season, played fairly well.

"It's always an open competition," offensive coordinator Greg Briner explained. "I'd say right now Josh Padrick and David Tabor would be the first two because they played last year. Jamie's coming back from injury, so he would be behind them on the depth chart, but that's not to say that he can't move back up to where he was. 

Those two guys have done a good job, particularly Josh." 

It's difficult to imagine Tabor winning the starting nod. He's managed just six touchdowns and 664 yards in 23 games off the bench. 

A big portion of that came from a 200 yard, two touchdown performance when Burke dislocated his shoulder against FAU and Tabor came in to replace him. Whether it's Padrick or Burke, it will depend heavily on Burke's condition when players report to training camp on Aug. 8.

Padrick performed well in 2003, passing for 2,493 yards and taking less sacks (23) than Burke (38 in '02). He did however, throw as many interceptions as touchdowns (12). Burke tossed two more touchdowns than Padrick and one less interception in the previous year. His completion percentage (58) was also better than Padrick's (49).

Assuming that Burke is back to full strength by the start of camp, the competition is a win-win situation for FIU.  Burke was a first-team all-Independent selection as a true freshman and the only first-year quarterback nominated for All-American honors by The Sports Network. 

Padrick, who is considered the more athletic of the two, was red-shirted and given time to mature behind a clip board. All he did when given the chance was throw for 841 more yards than Burke, despite having less starts. 

When a quarterback goes on the injured list for an extended period of time, the toughest part for a player is getting back into football rhythm and Briner knows this will be Burke's biggest challenge.

"Burke will have his work cut out for him," Briner added. "He has a lot to do to get back from his injury in terms of rehab and strengthening and getting back in a groove, but he can certainly move back up. The position is wide open."

Regardless of who takes the first snap when the season opens at home against Jacksonville, the principle goal has to be improving on last year's dismal 2-10 record.

FIU is headed into its third season with a schedule that includes Division I-A teams, a bigger challenge for the 2004 starting quarterback.

&nbsp;
I was sent to pick her up. My mother had explained to me that Yolanda was very depressed, that she cannot take it anymore, and her daughter is the only thing keeping her alive. 

At first, I thought it was one of those crises women go through, and I begged my mother: "Do I really have to?" Unfortunately, I had no other choice. I arrived at her house at 11:15 a.m. She was ready. That is when I realized she was really ill. In the past, this woman had made me wait as much as an hour, but not today. Today, she was ready! 

That could only mean she was desperate to get out, desperate to be saved from her house, from her mind, and everything else that was killing her. 

She received me with a big smile, but I could still see the pain and sadness in her eyes. She looked like a tired old woman but she was my mother's age. I wondered how much suffering this woman had felt, and how many horrible experiences she had lived. 

I had never met a person who wanted to end her life before, but as I drove back home I heard her story and realized that hers was not a unique pain, but a feeling shared by many people living her same experience.

Yolanda came to the United States 14 years ago. It is certainly easy to say, to hear, but leaving her mother, husband and sisters was not an easy decision. Unfortunately, her daughter's illness did not leave her another option. She hoped to find the treatment for a condition that was unknown in Cuba. 

That is how she became another Cuban accused of betraying her country and joining "la mafia de Miami," (the mafia of Miami) as Castro would put it. 

Hers was not a political reason or a desire to manifest her opposition; it was her love and obligation as a mother that made her sacrifice everything to give her daughter the opportunity to live. What was her reward?

She is now a type-1 diabetic, lives in a room where even a mouse would feel uncomfortable, and her landlord does not allow her to turn on the air conditioning during the day. 

None of this ever seemed to affect her. She always received my mother and me with a smile and never complained about her situation. 

Nothing could destroy her spirit until three months ago when her mother died. She had no chance to see her, no chance to say goodbye. Her economical situation was not, and never has been, stable, and although money prevented her from visiting her mom, she knows money is not always the problem. I agree.

The problem now seems to be Bush's new reforms, which states that an individual must wait three years since his last visit to go to Cuba again. 

"If my Mom was alive and I had money, I would still not be able to go," she said. 

Castro has already responded to Bush's policy by increasing the price of essentials like food and clothing, which was already expensive before these changes. Cubans' only salvation, which was the annual visit they received from relatives who live here, has vanished and with it, their only way to survive. 

Yolanda fears for her sisters and husband; "What is going to happen to them?" As I listened to her, I wondered the same.

I felt not only sadness and fear, but also disappointment. I, like Yolanda and many other Cubans, thought I was escaping from what everyone called a dictator who controlled every aspect of our lives. 

I could not travel, nor speak my thoughts, nor give my opinions. I lived in a cage and was promised the land of opportunity, so I came here, only to realize it was the same here. 

She read my mind and said: "This is the same s**t, just a wealthy Cuba."

As I made the right turn that would finally bring me home, she started drying her eyes. Now I could understand her suffering, her wrinkled eyes and her deplorable condition. I could not only understand her but understand every Cuban as well. I felt lucky to have my parents and sister here, yet this woman's experience was so familiar to me. I realized it was not only Yolanda's sad episode but it could be mine too. 

This pain did not have a name or a face. It did not belong to anybody.

I proceeded to imagine my cousins, my dear grandparents, and I wondered: "How many daughters and sons will lose their parents in these three years?" 

I looked at Yolanda and remembered the old lady who goes to the agency and sends money to her son. I remembered the woman who last week bought a little truck for her sister's son in K-mart. 

I remembered the son who cannot decide which one is better for his father: the black pair of shoes or the brown sandals? He cannot get both pairs because he is only allowed to take 44 pounds with him, and there are still eight more relatives to think about.

I suddenly realized "Hitler" wasn't too severe a word to describe a person who was making people like Yolanda more miserable than they already were.

"We are here," I said. 

She was happy to see my mother, even happier when she heard Mom say: "I bought bocaditos." 

Then, before I could forget the sad story and submerge myself again in a world of television and superficiality, I gave my mother a hug.

Headline: Marine Biology complex expands program options
Author: Andrea Flores / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The new Marine Biology building at the Biscayne Bay Campus will not only add more classrooms, but will also bring excitement and new opportunities to FIU.

The 57,000-square foot laboratory will be located just behind the Wolfe University Center and AC1. "We will finally have a building that promises to take full advantage of the bay view," said Julio Esteban, a major in business administration. 

 It will have five classrooms and four teaching labs including the future Symposium room which will have a capacity for 115 students. 

"Classes for non-marine biology majors will be held at the new building," said Christopher L. Brown, director of the marine biology program. He is the former director of the Hawaiian Institute of Marine Biology, and founder of the Hawaiian Aquaculture Association. His proven experience, creativity and hard work will be essential as the conceptual planner of the lab. 

Modesto A. Maidique, thePresident of FIU, approved the building in 2002. The Public Education Capital Outlay (PECO) approved the use of $11 million for the construction of the building. Maidique approved $1.75 million for the design. The total cost of this project will be $12.75 million and will be completed by the fall of 2005.

There will be an aquarium room with continuous sea water and air supply. It will be available to house specimens and research projects. "It is very exciting to be a part of this innovative project," said Valerie Hall, the program's secretary. 

There are currently 26 students majoring in marine biology. "We teach a course called Introductory Marine Biology which is for non-majors, usually a few hundred people take it each year," said Dr. Brown. 

The degree program was established in October of 2001. Before that, students who dreamed of becoming marine biologists and staying in the state of Florida had limited options. They could move to St. Petersburg or Melbourne or pay the high tuition fees at the University of Miami.

Now, the marine biology program at FIU will not only have capacity for more students  and an exceptional faculty, but will also offer those who dream of swimming with the dolphins and living a life with sea creatures an opportunity to experience that at FIU.

Headline: Weight-lifting class motivates women to shape up
Author: Maria-Perla Merzeau / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Fitness Center, in collaboration with the Health and Wellness Center, is offering the weight training program at the University Park campus. 

Since last spring, FIU students are able to learn how to tone their muscles at the new Women on Weights class.  

The new program started in Summer B and currently has about 30 faculty and staff members enrolled. At a fee of $12, the class will run for six weeks.

The program is available to FIU students and staff and the next registration for the class will be in the fall.

The program provides instruction in the basics of weight training by using free weights. As the program grows, they will introduce more complex equipment for working out, like stability balls or resistance bands.  The class also combines an abs work out and the members will receive handouts with tips on proper eating and stretching. 

Christina Theosevis, the Campus Fitness Center coordinator, is teaching the class with the help of Daphne Ardizon, the lead aerobics instructor and fitness assistant. 

 According to Theosevis, the classes are an "introductory learning technique and form,  simply having a motivation and comfort of just having women in there, women looking for the same goals, having the same problems, whether it is gaining muscle tone or losing weight." 

With the class, the instructors are expecting to encourage women to incorporate weight training into their daily work out routine and motivate them to take other classes at the gym.  

"Many women are becoming conscious of their bodies and realizing the benefits of the weights and fitness," Theosevis said. 

Even though the class mainly focuses on weight training, Theosevis recommends to also incorporate cardiovascular exercises to get a better result.

Donna Wyborny, the Campus Fitness Center administrative assistant, is one of the faculty members who is enrolled in the class and is expecting to lose some weight with the program. 

"I feel like I needed a change in my work out and I've never really worked out with a group with weights and I think that I could learn how to lift," Wyborny said.  

Another faculty member who joined the program is Vivian Jorge, the National Hurricane Center administrative officer. 

"With the class, I expect to gain more muscle and burn fat," Jorge said. 

Both Theosevis and Ardizon have experience in weight training. Ardizon has been working  at FIU for more than five years and Theosevis started working at FIU last October. 

Theosevis has a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing and a Master of Science in Education with a concentration in Sports Management. She looks forward to moving to the New Recreation Center that is estimated to be completed by this Fall.  

"We are here as a motivation and just to encourage women to start taking care of their bodies and realizing the importance of weight lifting and that women do not have to lift heavy weights to get results," Theosevis said.  "I recommend the class to anybody, fit or unfit, it is never late to start working out."   

Last spring, most of the class members were students and the class incorporated an aerobics work out with some weight training. 

One of those students is Chantal Clement, a major in international business student who took an aerobics class in Summer A.  " It helped me to keep fit."  Clement said.

Many students think that taking these kind of fitness classes are good in order to keep them in shape.

 Stephanie Abreu, a major in physical education, also took an aerobics class last spring. She feels that those classes are good if you want to lose weight.  "I liked the class because it was a long period and you burn calories," Abreu said. 

Another FIU student, Haleema Dalal, took the class Awesome Abs and thought it was helpful. "In a class, there is a bigger motivation to work out," Dalal said.

Raynelle Boissiere, an MIS Alumna took a spinning class and thought it was a good experience. " It gave me more energy, "Boissiere said.

Headline: With the completion of their new fraternity house approaching, Pi Kappa Alpha moves closer to home.
Author: Providence Okoye / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A new fraternity house is being built at the entrance of University Park. The house, which costs approximately $1.17million, is the new home for the Greek fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, also known as PIKE.

"This is the second Greek housing being built on an FIU campus, and we are proud of it," said Larry W. Lunsford, assistant vice president of the University and Ombudsman for Student Affairs.

The PIKE house is being constructed to the right of the Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI) house in the area carved out for Greek housing, which is at the 107th avenue entrance to FIU.  

The builders are JNC Constructors, and the monthly maintenance costs are estimated at approximately $15,000. 

"The bulk of the money we got came from PIKE alumni and fundraising," said PIKE member Manny Niebla, a junior majoring in finance. 

A bank loan in form of mortgage covered the rest of the cost that alumni and fundraising couldn't cover. 

"Great. It's about time," said FIJI member Will Almarales, a senior majoring in computer and electrical engineering, when asked about how he felt about his soon-to-be neighbors. "It's pretty lonely out there and I'm happy for them."

With 16 rooms and a capacity to house 36 members, a house director or resident assistant, it would cost approximately $2,000 per semester per student, which is about $700 less than housing on campus. 

The construction should be completed by mid-October of this year. But according to Lunsford, "it would not be open for housing until the spring of next year."

The PIKE house is the second fraternity house to debut on campus. The FIJI house was the first Greek house to be built at FIU after a donation of about $1.2 million from FIJI alumnus R. Kirk Landon. 

The FIJI house has a  capacity to house 34 people. It cost approxmately $380 a month for fraternity members on a 12-month contract, and $450 a month for non-members. 

"The university approved the site for Greek housing about seven or eight years ago, and the five groups approved for the five lots have been working to get loans and build since then," said Lunsford.

After about years of planning, the PIKE house is nearing completion; however, one of the  concerns is that there may not be enough members to occupying the house.

"I think that would be a major problem we would have. It's hard to be a commuter school and have people live on campus. We are on track to filling the house, but it's such a mission," said PIKE member Aldo Guerrero, a sophomore majoring in marketing.

But other students don't see a problem with occupying the house. "Definitely, I would live there," says Niebla, when asked if he would consider moving in to the new house, "as a fraternity,  we are excited to contribute to FIU and increase the school spirit that comes along with Greek housing."

According to Lunsford, three more Greek houses are scheduled for construction:  Sigma Phi Epsilon, Tau Kappa Epsilon and eventually, Sigma Alpha Mu. 

"It's a nice house, the second one being built. Well what can I say? [Tau Kappa Epsilon was] supposed to be second but we'll be next, so I'm happy!" said  Tau Kappa Epsilon member Alberto Robles, a sophomore.

Headline: New sunscreen fends off pesky jellyfish stings
Author: Sherry Jacobson / The Dallas Morning News
&nbsp;
A new kind of sunscreen hitting the U.S. market promises not only to fend off sunburns but also to protect against jellyfish stings.

Researchers at Stanford University Medical School tested the new product, called SafeSea, on two dozen volunteers and found it "relatively effective" in inhibiting jellyfish stings.

"It prevents stings most of the time," said Alexa Kimball, an assistant professor of dermatology who directed the study, funded in part by the manufacturer, Nidaria Technology. It was published in the journal, Wilderness and Environmental Medicine.

Israeli researchers developed the cream after noticing that clownfish - of "Finding Nemo" fame - do not get stung by jellyfish. 

They isolated the chemical that seemed to protect the little orange and white fish and incorporated the substance into a sunscreen solution.

"It's not like a barrier that would protect your skin, the way a scuba suit does," Kimball explained. "It's more like the jellyfish detects the chemical on you and it doesn't sting you."

At least, that's what seemed to occur when jellyfish were given a chance to sting the 24 people in her experiment. (Most of the subjects were surfers who had been stung before.)

SafeSea was swabbed on one arm of each volunteer and regular sunscreen on the other arm. Jellyfish tentacles were placed on their arms for up to 60 seconds to see what would happen.

Five of the 24 subjects reported "discomfort" on the arm protected with SafeSea, whereas 22 of them had pain and swelling on the plain sunscreen arm.

That was good news to marine biologist Paul Montagna, a jellyfish expert at the University of Texas' Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas.

Until now, marine experts could only recommend using meat tenderizer to lessen the pain from a jellyfish sting. Jellyfish are most common in the Gulf of Mexico from April through June.

"Our water is so warm that we have a lot of people swimming along the coast year round," said Montagna, a frequent victim of jellyfish stings. "There are lots of opportunities for people to get stung. I don't know this product but hope it works."

SafeSea is available online at www.nidaria.com and other sites.

Headline: MSNBC host recognizes realities of Anchorman
Author: James Endrst / New York Daily News
&nbsp;
Will Ferrell plays an egotistical news reader in the comedy "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."  

Keith Olbermann thinks being an anchorman might be a form of mental illness.

"You know, schizophrenia, acute depression, being on television," says Olbermann, the host of MSNBC's "Countdown With Keith Olbermann." 

And who better to make a few observations on Will Ferrell's new off-the-wall comedy, "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," than, well, an anchorman?

Invited by the New York Daily News to watch the movie, which opened Friday, Olbermann said he expected to spend much of the time looking at his watch and screaming silently, "Let me out of here!"

Instead, he found the film "enjoyable," though, he was quick to add, "I don't know that I'll be seeing it again."

Maybe that's because Olbermann had seen some of it before.In the course of his own 25-year career.

"There was a lot in there that really wasn't that absurd," said Olbermann.

In "Anchorman," Ferrell's character, Ron Burgundy, is a hard-drinking, heavy-breathing, monumentally self-absorbed newsman who'd make Ted Baxter look like Walter Cronkite.

As honest-to-goodness newsman Bill Kurtis says about Burgundy in a voiceover: "He was a God walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo."

And as Burgundy himself says to anyone who will listen: "I look good. I mean, really good. Hey, everyone, come and see how good I look."

Overinflated egos are hardly a thing of the past in TV news, said Olbermann. "A lot of these guys in this business - and I'm one of them, too - they create their own personalities and then re-create them.

"So whatever is wrong with us is compensated for by that braggadocio, that bravado (that they feel by just) being on the air."

So Ted Baxter, the ultimate bubbleheaded anchorman, played by Ted Knight in the '70s on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," is still alive and kicking.

"The thing about Baxter was that he basically could not be killed," said Olbermann. "There was nothing you could do to stop him."

In the movie, the one thing that bothered Olbermann was the "nonstop sexual harassment - that was too over the top for me."

Burgundy is thrown for a loop when reporter Veronica Corningstone, played by Christina Applegate, arrives at his San Diego station.

But the initial reaction from her "Anchorman" co-workers - the howling, pawing and drooling - was not a completely outlandish characterization of TV Land past, Olbermann admits.One anchor, whom Olbermann would not name, used to tell him in sonorous and serious tones: "You know, I'm not a rocket scientist, I know that, I just got a sweet tooth." And by sweet tooth, he meant a love of women.

"And every night there'd be a different woman who would come in to watch him do the news at 11 o'clock and off he'd go."

Television anchors of the "Anchorman" mold, past or present, aren't stupid, he said. They're just "oblivious."

And yes, Burgundy-style anchormen are still with us.

"They're more homogenized," and, he added, replaceable.

Headline: Pop artists exhaust creative resources, recycle retro hits
Author: Teresa Gubbins / The Dallas Morning News
&nbsp;
The calendar may say 2004, but turn on the radio and you'll feel as if you are totally in the `80s.

 Your ears do not deceive you: That is definitely "Take My Breath Away" airing on contemporary radio, though a different version than the one by Berlin (used so dramatically in the film "Top Gun"). And yes, 23 years after the Go-Go's first sang "Our Lips Are Sealed," it's back again - but this time covered by Hilary Duff, the teen star who is younger than the song itself.

The `80s are back on the radio because there's a wave of bands doing cover versions of these 20-year-old songs. These blasts from the past keep piling up, and they're turning "modern rock" radio into oldies stations: from Don Henley's "Boys of Summer" (as done by the Ataris) to The Cure's "Love Song" (by 311) to No Doubt's remake of "It's My Life" by one-hit wonder Talk Talk.

 What next: Flock of Seagulls? Ouch, yes, and we have the band Bowling for Soup to curse for covering the Flock's "I Ran (So Far Away)."

There's no single villain to blame for leading popular music to this sorry state. But these "pioneers" deserve some of the credit.

The Ataris were early perpetrators with their 2003 cover of "Boys of Summer," helping make it OK within the twentysomething set to embrace `80s songs.

In late 2003, Sony released a compilation called Never Mind the Originals, Here's the Covers with too, too many `80s tunes, including "Take on Me" by A-Ha (performed by Reel Big Fish) and Nena's "99 Red Balloons" (performed by Goldfinger).

The soundtrack to "50 First Dates" piled on in early `04 with its own retro collection of covers of `80s acts such as Echo & the Bunnymen, the Police and The Cure.

But in the end, it's a generational thing. Most acts doing `80s covers are in their 20s. The `80s are when they grew up. The `80s are their roots.

Ataris singer Kris Roe explained his connection to "Boys of Summer" on WB music series Pepsi Smash as a personal thing.

"I used to go down and visit my grandparents in Florida every summer," he said on the show. "And my grandmother, I actually remember asking her to take me out and buy that record. When it came out, I was like 9 years old. And my grandmother, she passed away like three years ago. So that song is kind of personal for me, and kind of reminds me of my grandmother and those summers I used to spend in Florida."

 Jessica Simpson had her own first-hand experience with "Take My Breath Away."

"It was a special song for me and my relationship with my husband," she says of Nick Lachey. "We had our first kiss to it. The first time Nick hugged me, I played it in the car after I was driving home. Cheesy stuff like that made me want to do it myself."

Both Simpson and Bowling for Soup have used these covers to beef up albums they've reissued - and nabbed surprise hit singles in the process.You know what that means: more `80s covers, coming your way.

Here's the current crop, each with its own individual rating of how well the new band does compared to the original:

Berlin vs. Jessica Simpson: "Take My Breath Away"

 Simpson gets four Tom Cruise Beaming Grins out of five for selecting a song that so perfectly enhances her glossy `80s image.

The Cure vs. 311: "Love Song"

311 gets three Robert Smith Kohl Black Eyeliner Pencils out of five for giving this Cure song a reggae twist.

Don Henley vs. the Ataris: "Boys of Summer"

The Ataris set the standard for `80s covers by making woolly behemoth activist Don Henley seem hip. They get five Historic Tree Seedlings out of five.

Talk Talk vs. No Doubt: "It's My Life"

Gwen Stefani gets only two Skinny Black Neckties out of five for trying to outdo emotive original singer Mark Hollis.

The Go-Go's vs. Hillary Duff: "Our Lips Our Sealed"

Duff chooses her `80s cut wisely, it fits like a glove. She gets four Cucumber Facials out of five.

Flock of Seagulls vs. Bowling for Soup: "I Ran (So Far Away)"

The BFS guys should have their heads shaved for bringing back such a dreadful (though certainly classic) `80s track. But wait, their heads are shaved already. Let's give them five Foo-Foo Haircuts out of five
