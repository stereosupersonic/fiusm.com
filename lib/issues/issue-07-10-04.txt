Headline: Writing center brings out the 'Write' stuff
Author: Kassandra Elizee / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Because she is a journalism major, Janice Vilchez decided it was important to improve her grammar. As a result, she has utilized the School of Journalism and Mass Communication's Scripps Howard Writing Center twice.

"I'd rather come in here and have my assignments reviewed by my professor [Jane Daugherty], the ones I work with," Vilchez said.

Vilchez believes that students will get more out of the center, located in Academic II, room 303, of the Biscayne Bay Campus, if they come on a regular basis to work on their writing and grammar rather than use it as a last resort. 

The center first opened in March 2007 in order to help students improve their writing. 

Poor writing is a nationwide epidemic because students graduate from high school without knowing how to write or apply grammar rules properly, according to Kate MacMillin, professor and writing center administrator.

"Students are not coming to school with the skills they should have to write. The reason why students have these writing issues is because people are ignoring this problem. What is wonderful is FIU saying 'we're not going to let this go, we're not going to let our students out of SJMC without knowing how to write, we're taking this on aggressively,'" MacMillin said.

MacMillin emphasized that, although the center is for SJMC students only, these students can use the center for other school- related writing projects and other personal writing needs.

"We offer what we find the most valuable and that's time with a professional, one-on-one. Not only for students who are struggling, but good students who want to excel. What we want to do here is give support outside of the classroom for our students. We want to make this the "go to" place," MacMillin said.

MacMillin said that as of now, the hours of tutoring have increased to 10 hours a week. She, Daugherty and Neil Reisner, SJMC professors, share these hours and have assisted students with their documentaries, the structuring of a story and grammar.

"It's a really big advantage a student has for someone to sit here and read the paper [the student's paper], talk about their issues and help them see it, it's really a pleasant experience on both sides," MacMillin said.

MacMillin adds that, as a result of visiting all SJMC courses that were offered during the summer in order to introduce the center to students, an 80 percent increase in the center's utilization has occurred. Allan Richards, Chair for SJMC, said that once there is a set amount of students utilizing the center per semester, the center's staff will make necessary changes through a step-by-step process.

Richards implemented the center's opening at BBC. When the SJMC received a $150,000 grant from the Scripps Howard Foundation, which was to be distributed over the course of three years, he began to plan the center's opening.

Richards wanted to have a place where students could come in for the purpose of improving their writing skills, especially their communications students.

"You have to know how to write in a multimedia environment," he said.

The center's money during its first year has gone towards "setting up the center, getting two faculty members to coordinate, and deal with the professional tutoring and mentoring," explains Richards. 

Richards said that in the future he hopes to make improvements like including workshops, seminars, and upgrade the computers 

MacMillin said she would like to see guests come speak about writing to small groups.She would also like for the center to provide more material like books for students to be able to take home and read.

Richards says he is proud of the center's accomplishments so far, and so is its sponsor, Scripps Howard.

"I have to write reports to the foundation [Scripps Howard]; they're really happy with what we're doing with the money," he said.

Students can drop in anytime during operating hours. According to the schedule posted on the center's door, Daugherty is there on Mondays and Wednesdays, from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., and on Tuesdays, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. MacMillin is at the center on Mondays and Wednesdays, 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and on Thursdays, 4 to 6 p.m. 

The sign at the center's door also says that students may drop in or e-mail Daugherty at daughert@fiu.edu, or MacMillin, at kate.macmillin@fiu.edu for an appointment. 

Students may also e-mail MacMillin to set up a personal appointment.

Headline: SPC-BBC president talks about life, council goals
Author: Wilma Hernandez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Although she works more hours than required of a Student Programming Council president, Janette Francois finds that she gets most of her work done when the Biscayne Bay Campus's Campus Life office is empty.

"Here, [at the office], it's always busy; that's why today I have the lights off, so I can get work done," said Francois, a junior and Elementary Education major.

Francois, who was elected to a second term as SPC-BBC president, is currently serving her final term. Her schedule next year as a senior will consist of teaching an elementary school class as part of an intern program, which will prevent her from committing time to SPC-BBC.

"As a teacher I will focus on problem solving skills, which helps [students] to think," Francois said. 

Francois hopes to leave a firm foundation and a lasting impression for future SP-Councils.

"I [did] my best to be here for the council whenever they needed me, whether or not it dealt with SPC or personal things," she said.

Francois' motivation for the job comes from her love for event planning, which she discovered while planning for a fashion show during her sophomore year at Flanagan High in Broward County.

"I still would like to become a well known designer for curvy-figured women and hope to make it big one day," Francois said.

She considers herself to be dedicated to the betterment of SPC-BBC by attracting more students through more programming at BBC. Francois said she and the council do this by promoting campus life events via word of mouth, Facebook.com, MySpace.com, flyers, the electronic board and radio for major events.

Francois said that as president, she has kept SPC-BBC organized by managing their yearly budget of $231,196.80 effectively.

"We try to save as much as possible and we don't need to cut down events because of budget," Francois said. 

She is now focusing on getting students and the North Miami community more involved through a variety of SPC-BBC events, such as the AIDS Walk this Fall.

In addition, SPC-BBC is sponsoring Dancing with the Wolfe, which is a variety of weekly dancing lessons, such as Ballroom, Salsa, Hip-Hop and Belly dancing classes.

Movie Series is a weekly event that features box office hits every Thursday. Ocean's Thirteen will be featured on Oct. 18 and Transformers on Nov. 1.

Francois also works 32 hours a week during nights and weekends as a customer service representative for Interactive Response Technologies, a call center which provides services for cell phone carrier T-Mobile. 

Although Francois finds the job stressful, she said it's necessary to pay her bills and to afford her wedding in 2008. She will marry her boyfriend of two years, Melvin Jr., who is currently at the Army base in Ft. Stewart, Ga.

Despite her many activities, she finds time for her hobbies such as scrap booking, drawing, and making picture collages. Francois said she just finished a scrap book which shows SPC-BBC summer activities and past events she has planned such as the Summer Splash pool party, Women's Celebration fashion show and Hispanic Heritage Latin Explosion concert. 

Francois feels she has made good friends through SPC-BBC, such as secretary Leatrice Gachette, who shares an office with her.

Gachette portrays Francois as someone very dynamic, a hard worker who loves SPC-BBC and strives to uphold its legacy of programming excellence. 

"The office has a very positive atmosphere and I enjoy working with her because she is a big enforcer of the motto 'work hard, play hard.'" Gachette said. "She promotes passion and dedication within her co-workers, and ensures we don't let our commitments to the organization affect negatively our personal or academic lives."

Johnnita Hatcher, SPC-BBC treasurer, said Francois is always willing to help SPC-BBC members out.

"She is always the last one to leave from an event and contributes mostly by making sure the council brings great programs that students will enjoy," Hatcher said.

Headline: Scripps Day: Editors, reporters discuss journalism at Scripps Day
Author: Isaac Cruz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Jimena Ordoñez said she enjoyed Scripps Day on Oct. 3
because her Online News Reporting class was taught by
a representative of the multimedia E.W. Scripps
Company and she also had her résumé critiqued.

"[The School of Journalism and Mass Communication] did an excellent job getting [E.W. Scripps president and CEO, Ken Lowe] and [Scripps employees to take] the time to give speeches on digital media. It was important for everyone to be there," Ordoñez said.

During Scripps Day, 23 representatives from the
company critiqued students' résumés and gave presentations throughout the day about investigative journalism and the possible careers within the advertising and marketing fields. 

Seminars and workshops were also given about the future of print media, broadcast journalism and cable television.

Students had the opportunity to have some of their journalism classes taught by the representatives.
David Berry, SJMC marketing coordinator, was proud that the multimedia company that owns television channels such as the Food Network and HGTV among other things, chose SJMC to host their event.

"I'm confident that they've chosen the [SJMC] because of our rapidly growing reputation and the fact that we play such a huge role specifically in educating Hispanic students. In fact, the SJMC has awarded more bachelor's degrees in communication than any other college or university in the country," Berry said.

Lowe, the keynote speaker of the event, lectured and gave a PowerPoint presentation on the rapid changes of multimedia in regards to journalism in the Wolfe University Center ballroom, which was filled to capacity. The lecture was open to the public.

People have an appetite for information in this digital world and the problem is keeping up with the current multimedia trends, according to Lowe. People are now demanding headline news instantly through the Internet, Lowe said.

"There is a pressure on newspaper [because the] online audience is growing up and the revenue stream for newspapers is in an ebb and flow," Lowe said. "Our challenge is immediacy. We have to get it right no matter how tight out deadlines may be. Online video has increased in popularity and Internet can become the next TV."

Lowe also talked about new advances in media. One example Lowe gave during his lecture was the slingbox, which allows someone to watch their home television from anywhere in the world from their laptop or video cell phone, provided they have Internet access.

Lowe also talked about a patent phone that could potentially provide medical assistance. Lowe said the phone keeps track of a person's heartbeat. If the heartbeat were to become irregular, an ambulance team would pinpoint the person's location. This, however, would tradeoff with privacy, Lowe said.

At the end of the presentation, the audience was able to ask Lowe questions. One question was regards to the
Scripps company possibly providing media in other languages.

Lowe responded by saying that his company provides television shows solely online that are not provided anywhere else. 

"Spanish communication is the right thing to do and in different languages. It would be foolish not to change" Lowe said.

Headline: HALLOWEEN HORROR NIGHTS: Fright fest light on fright, heavy on fest
Author: Chris Cabral / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
The haunted houses at Halloween Horror Nights aren't exactly horrifying, unless you're frightened of long lines and over priced concessions. That doesn't mean you won't have a good time, though. 

In its seventeenth year, Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios has rolled out some new themes and features, including three houses based on well known horror movie characters Leather Face (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th) and Freddy (A Nightmare on Elm Street). 

The event sports a carnival theme this year, with eerie circus music constantly blaring from speakers, and even a Ferris wheel. 

So the combination of three iconic horror characters and a spooky carnival theme is bound to be scary, right? Right? 	

The organizers once again promise an evening of terror, yet as you walk through the park and enjoy the many haunted houses, don't be too disappointed if you feel like leaving early. 

Universal Studios might have put forth a nice amount of effort, but the finished product will terrify only those who are easily frightened. 

You may be startled by the occasional actor popping out of nowhere in one of the eight houses, but if you're like me, you'll be more interested in the women who parade through the streets of Universal selling Jell-O shots. 

Despite the somewhat disappointing haunted houses, the ubiquitous fog machines and cast of actors wandering through the streets make for a cool, somewhat creepy atmosphere. Nowhere is the ambience more impressive than in the "scare zones," walkways in the park that are so clouded with fog that you'll barely be able to notice the actors waiting to sneak up on you. 

In one area, people dressed like demonic nineteenth-century English gentlemen and women will come so close to you that you can feel their breath on your neck. 

You'll want to check your pockets to make sure they haven't taken your wallet. 

By the way some of these actors are dressed, you'll wonder why you're supposed to be afraid of them. Why would people dressed like they just walked of the set of Wes Craven's: Mary Poppins frighten anyone? 

The worst it seems they might do is serve bad tea, or refuse the requests of young orphans who dare to ask: "Can I have some more?" 

Nevertheless, the actors do a commendable job. 

The commitment and enthusiasm of those who stroll though the park, in full costume without breaking character, might be the best part of the event. 

It takes a very dedicated actor to wander through the parks, glaring menacingly as they brandish sharp objects in front of Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast.

Some of the haunted houses, while not particularly scary, are certainly creative. One house, "Psycho-scareapy: Home for the Holidays" is set in a nursing home that is invaded by escaped psycho-killers during Christmas time. One of the event's organizers described it as "like Halloween threw up all over Christmas." 

The "Vampyr Blood Bath" aims to answer the age-old question: "What would happen if Vampires took over an S & M club in Chicago?" 

The answer: Scantily clad female vampires would choose to dance in cages and do mildly gruesome things while someone (a vampire DJ?) plays dance music. 

Perhaps what makes the haunted houses seem so tame is the fact that there is a uniformed Universal Studios employee around every corner. 

It's hard to be frightened when behind every knife wielding maniac, there is a guy named Chad in a name tag who seems visibly bored; at one point, during the Vampyr Blood Bath, I saw one employee yawning. 

Having wandered through five haunted houses, I couldn't blame him. 

Go to Halloween Horror Nights if you really want, but make sure you ride some of the rides which they keep open at night, like the Revenge of the Mummy roller coaster. 

At least there, you won't catch anyone yawning.

Headline: Drama club embraces all majors
Author: Enrica Rymer / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When one thinks about a dramatic production - whether it's a movie, a television show or a play - "Lights, Camera, Action!" is a phrase that commonly comes to mind.

The same phrase can be affiliated with Dramatic Paws, an FIU drama club comprised of students and faculty and is part of the Student Organizations Council.

"There have been members who have long since graduated and faculty members who have come and gone who were in the group," said Dramatic Paws current president Matthew Mur. 

Mur, who is a senior, is beginning his first year as president of the organization and hopes to increase the club's exposure by appealing to people majoring outside of theatre.

"This year is a little different and going to be a lot of footwork," he said. "We're trying to branch out to the rest of the school and include individuals of all majors, not just those belonging to theatre."

One of Mur's goals this year is to keep Dramatic Paws strong and an active part of the FIU community and he's "trying to raise the Dramatic Paws like a phoenix from the ashes."

In his plans for a more diverse Dramatic Paws, Mur talks about an inter-working world of drama, where architectural majors are helping with set design, engineering majors are helping with the technical aspects and business majors are having their first screenplay put into motion by the club.

When the club first started, it was mainly used as a means for members to gain experience in play readings. 

They began by reading the works of local Hispanic artists and have since expanded to the works of local students. 

Members of the club gain experience in play reading, but there's also another aspect to the readings: those interested in play writing could gain constructive criticism on their works and, after having submitted a proposal as to why their play should be considered, could have their works performed onstage.

This year, the club is trying to see whether it can have Tony-nominated actor John Cariani come teach a workshop and share his knowledge of the business with members. 

Cariani has been in numerous television and movie roles and written several plays such as Almost Maine, but he is best known for his role in the Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway.

Aside from the potential workshop, the club also has its longest standing tradition happening this semester, "Wacky Winter". 

"Wacky Winter" is a cabaret of sorts," said Mur. 

The show is a mash-up of loosely based Christmas themes and family values, with singing and dancing. 

Each year, the show is written by the students and the proceeds from the event go toward Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, which raises money for AIDS-related causes; according to its web site www.broadwaycares.org, the organization has raised over $130 million since 1998. 

Past President Mike Lioune, a senior, has been in Dramatic Paws ever since his freshman year. 

He fondly remembers that Wacky Winter, which takes place during Finals week, as an escape from the burdens of finals. 

"After studying for finals, it was a nice way to release the tension and forget about everything that was due," he said.

Mur stresses the importance of keeping Dramatic Paws an outlet for expression without censorship.

"There's this quote from Sam Sheppard that goes, 'Theatre is a safe place to do unsafe things' and that's what this club is: it's a safe environment to express yourself creatively," said Mur. 

After hearing about the Dramatic Paws, Joy Deitrich, a junior, feels it would help people looking to find a start in the theatre business.

"The club sounds kind of cool, and it seems like a way to get your foot in the door with the acting thing, while gaining theatrical experience," she said.

The club meets monthly in Deuxieume Maison 150, where productions are also held.

Headline: Dealing With Grief: Different stages allow mourner to move on
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Four years ago, a childhood friend of Lyzette Blanco, a junior in marketing, was murdered by a family member. She remembers sitting at home when her father called the house bearing the bad news of her friend's death. 

"I was in disbelief even though I was seeing him on the news," she said. "It wasn't until the next day when it was announced over the morning announcements at school that I began to cry over his death."

The death of a friend or a relative leaves the heart pounding in pain and to a rhythm only its carrier can understand and heal with time. 

"There is no wrong way to deal with grief, death or anything like that. Everybody goes at their own pace," stated University Psychologist Seth Grossman from the department of Counseling/Psychological Services. "The problem is when the denial continues for three to four years, that's when it becomes unhealthy."  

According to author Dr. Elisabeth Kubler Ross, there are five stages of grief:



Stage 1: Shock and Denial



"This can't be happening to me" is a common reaction after the death of a love one. Grossman stated that this is one of the most important stages when it comes to grieving: the person must be able to feel that they can continue living. It is an adaptive process that the person goes through. Some may feel guilt and shame for way they feel, but it is fine to feel that way. As a result, a person may be less effective in other aspects to life such as being distracted, depression and mood disorders. 

"The best way is to be direct about it - sometimes it is too much to handle," Grossman said. "It is okay to cry and say that you are sad."



Stage 2: Anger



This is a stage where one might say that it's not fair this person was taken away from me, thus expressing anger about the death. The person might be angry with the deceased because he or she wants to fight back for being left behind. 

Not  everyone may feel this way, though. Some people may feel less angry when it comes to the loss of a grandparent or someone who has lived a long, healthy life. Other people might feel the sadness but not be angry.



Stage 3: Depression 



By being left alone, frustration, bitterness, self pity and suicidal thoughts can occur to a person. At this point, it is recommended for the person to seek help by either speaking to a psychologist or going to bereavement groups such as the one at Kendall Community Church of God, located at 8795 SW 112 Street. The group meets on Sundays at 10 a.m. During a meeting, people are allowed to emote.

"Involvement helps," said facilitator Karen Weitzman. "They are able to speak about the memory of their lost one and not keep it inside. The more family is involved the more, the person is able to speak about it and have a better recovery."



Stage 4: Bargaining



Bargaining often takes place before the loss: the person attempts to make deals with God or with themselves that they don't share with others. If a person does it after the loss, he or she tries to make as if nothing really happen. 

According to Grossman, it is like an unconscious process because the person can't do anything to make the situation better. 

Bargaining is the last attempt for them to make it right before they get to point of acceptance. This doesn't mean there's no sadness involved, but instead the griever comes to the point where he or she can move on. 

Stage 5: Acceptance



Realizing that the person is gone and that it was not their fault they left you is the final stage for grieving. 

"It's hard but everybody deals with it in a different way," said Blanco. "It's just knowing what makes you at peace, especially with the situation. You are the only one who knows how to deal with it the best way. I talked it over with my family. It helped me by accepting that he is always around me, not only spiritually but in my mind.

Headline: My Life! Experience: Life-lessons emerge from father's death
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
My final memory of my father is an unsettling one. This makes perfect sense, seeing that my father was an unsettling person. 

He was standing shirtless in the kitchen, looking through our empty refrigerator for some scraps to feed his dying mother. He was 45 then, I think 65 fit him best. 

He took out a plastic container with some leftover Chinese food from a few nights ago and continued to heat it in the microwave. He put three minutes on the timer and proceeded to feed Sally, our black Labrador. 

Gloveless, he reached for the container once the timer went off and dropped it after realizing how hot it was. I instantly fell to my knees to help clean the mess and take the soggy rice to the garbage. He told me to pick up the rice and to put it back on the plate; she was going to die soon so it was okay to feed her food off the floor.

I looked up at his distraught eyes and that's when I first noticed it. He had lost his masculine appeal, the same appeal I admired him for having when I was younger. The body he once kept toned and in shape had disintegrated itself into an excess of skin, fat and hair. His stomach now plummeted toward his feet and the hairs on his head had gone from jet-black curls to balding at all sides. The dark circles under his eyes reached an area of descending skin by his cheekbones. What was once a tanned and muscular body was now a burden of pale blotches; as if he had recently washed himself with bleach. It was also then when I realized that something could actually be emptier than our refrigerator: my father's heart.

I remember being picked on at school since the moment character began forming on my little bones. People began catching on to certain things I did or said that perhaps the 'normal' boy would not do or say.  My father was no exception to those people. I learned quickly that coming home with tears just proved to him how much less of a man I was.

He said having an effeminate son was his punishment for his past, but his mind was set on hating a gay child from the moment he thought it to be a possibility.

He allowed superstition and supposed friends to scare him into thinking that I would be gay because his ex-wife's brother was. He was too blinded by his own ignorance to realize he was given a healthy little boy; a little boy he later treated like a castaway just because he was different from the rest. 

For a while I remember wanting to please him; if he wouldn't love me, then he would love the me I created.

I never enjoyed soccer - only played because I got to spend time with him. It was obvious that he made it a point to aim for my stomach whenever I would play goalie, though.

His mother has not talked much since his unexpected death. When I told her he had died her screams lasted for a good hour; they still haunt me when I'm having a restless night. 

She confuses me for him a lot. She has his high school graduation picture alongside her bed, and I have to agree that the resemblance is uncanny. I moved into his room when he died. I slept in his bed, hung my clothing in his closet and looked out his window. I dealt with his mother's and his daughter's tears, all while holding in my own. I sold his dogs and his business and helped carry his coffin. If that's not brave, I don't know what is.

My father was right all along: I am gay. But having him as a constant reminder of what my mind was too young to piece together is evidently what led me to understanding who I am. I tried to make my father happy for a long time, now all I can do is attempt the same for myself.

Headline: David Gilmour promotes solo tour, DVD release
Author: Christopher Necuze / Production Manager
&nbsp;
On Sept. 20, Pink Floyd guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour held a roundtable interview with college reporters nationwide to speak about his new DVD, Remember That Night - Live at the Royal Albert Hall. The DVD, which saw release on Sept. 18, showcases Gilmour's London concert that featured guest appearances by David Bowie, David Crosby and Graham Nash.



Q: What spawned the idea for the DVD?



A: Well, the amount of touring that I do nowadays is a little bit limited. 

When I came to the states last year, I only did five cities and I'm just hoping that the DVD will be something that people who have a good entertainment system at home will invite a few friends over and enjoy with a glass of wine or something. 

I'm hoping to cover a number of the places I didn't actually get to, and this DVD is the next best thing to going to a gig.



Q: I noticed the DVD doesn't include any material from your last solo album. Is there any reason for this?



A: Well, the songs that I really like on my other solo albums are the ones which seem to have lost their relevance a little bit right at the moment. 

You know there are a couple songs on the second solo album called Cruise and Out of the Blue, which are rather about the Cold War and the nuclear proliferation that was going on at the time and the threat to peace in the West by the Soviet bloc. 

Those things don't really affect people anymore. 

It seemed like singing about something that was irrelevant, so I didn't bother. 

I just tried to make a list of all the songs that were relevant to me - from my albums, from Syd's albums and Pink Floyd albums - and basically cross off everything that didn't feel right and everything that was written almost entirely by Roger [Waters]. 

Those songs that were left, I practiced a little bit with my band, and those that I still wanted to play after 15 or so tries, we kept.



Q: As an artist, what type of quality control do you exert on your work, particularly for the DVD?



A: I'm afraid I'm a bit anal about that. 

I keep my hand in on everything - nothing gets on there that I haven't seen and approved thoroughly. 

It's very hard to keep tabs on absolutely everything, I can tell you, but I do my very best to do so. 

The sound mixing, I did it myself with my team of people and I think we did a pretty good job. 

The editing and the vision I've revisited several times. 

I've had to go in for the coloring and the grading of the DVD. 

There are a number of special features on the second disc, which all have to be agreed upon. 

I'm afraid that I just can't let it be, I have to keep my hand in on everything.



Q: "Echoes"  is considered one of the greatest songs ever written. Why did it take so long for another live, filmed version?



A: Well, Pink Floyd through the seventies, after a while, had a lot of other things we were concentrating on, so we didn't play it.

 In 1987 when I went out on tour for the Momentary Lapse of Reason album, we tried in rehearsal and a few times live, but it didn't seem to quite work for me in those days and it's very hard to pin down exactly why it didn't work. 

Some of the younger musicians that were with us on that tour didn't seem to quite get it and treat it with the sort of respect that I would want. 

So we thought we'd try it again this time. 

We rehearsed it, and everyone seemed to get it immediately. Something had changed, and the musicians I was playing it with, I've been playing with for a long time and it just worked this time. Rather hard to pin down exactly why. 

I had a ball doing it every night, though.



Q: What is the reaction you wish your fans to have when they watch the DVD?



A: Well, you know, I do it for me more than anyone. 

It's so I can have something to pick up and enjoy and show my children and so forth and so on. Now I hope that a lot of people come along for the ride, too, but I don't really have any notion of what I want to give to fans or anything like that. 

I think music is an art, and it is something that you're compelled to do. It comes out how it comes out. It's just something that happens to you, and you just hope that other people can enjoy what you've created.

&nbsp;
Ask yourself this question: What does FIU and the Chinese Government have in common? The answer is that they both have ties to Cisco Systems, a multi-national networking corporation and the largest provider of networking tools to the Communist Party of China. FIU students may recall seeing advertisements for a network connection client called, Clean Access Agent which is a mandatory requirement to use any FIU Internet services.   And as inconceivable as it sounds, this same technology provided by none other than Cisco Systems, bestows the Chinese government with Internet Surveillance and Censorship tools to quash Chinese Democratic Initiatives. Could they be doing the same on our FIU campus?

While this practice of providing services for international governments and unfavorable regimes is not unprecedented, it is reprimandable. It is unethical by the standards set for in any democratic society.

In the past, Cisco Systems has "peddled their wares to dictatorship after dictatorship" as author Ethan Gutmann put it in his revelatory book, "Losing the New China." After the deal for networking signed with China was announced in 2005, many college students around the country held demonstrations urging their schools to remove Cisco Systems, hoping to seize their profits and deliver them to corporations not supplying regimes with the technology to oppress human lives. These unethical corporations should possess no ties with educational institutions.

Most recently, students at the University of Central Florida staged a demonstration denouncing the school's affiliations with disreputable corporations such as Cisco Systems and Siemens, a Cisco affiliate and also a partner of FIU's School of Computing and Information Sciences. FIU even has Harald Braunas, a Siemens executive, serving on the School of Computing and Information Science's Advisory Board.

The Siemens Corporation, if anything, has a history of allegations for handling their business prospects unethically: Siemens has signed contracts with Sudan's genocidal Khartoum regime totaling more than $20 million, according to "Darfur Conflict Hits Home", an article published in Dallas Business Journal. And it doesn't end there.

The Harris Corporation, a generous donor of FIU's University Advancement Program,  is also among the corporations on trial for the furthering of oppression. For example, they're doing this in your own backyard: according to the Orlando Business Brief and a press release on the Harris website in September 2005, the Harris Corporation had penned a deal with the National Security Agency that aims to provide our government agency with the tools to unconstitutionally spy on Americans, which violates both the Fourth Amendment of the constitution. The Harris press release explains that the NSA can access private information from citizens' computers and personal effects, which is an unlawful search and seizure, which is protected in the amendment itself. As contributors to FIU, is it any wonder that student organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society are concerned that the money might be used to develop expressively suppressive programs with the NSA?

Members of the UCF chapter of SDS are heading the corporate divestment initiative as we speak.  And following suit is the newly formed chapter of SDS here at FIU, created in hopes of leading students in a similar initiative to remove a possible unethical entity within FIU.

Among the more deplorable parts of these partnerships is that we, the students, allow these corporations to think it is appropriate and generally acceptable to gain a profit for providing the tools for such travesties: assisting genocides, and aiding in censorship.

Students allow them to think this through our own inactivity: if we continue supporting Siemens, Cisco, and Harris, they'll keep giving money to Sudan and they'll continue spying upon whoever the wish but they cannot if we use our voices against them.

 Should any student or professor have to worry about some stranger reading their personal e-mails or their latest research paper? Should anyone have to wonder if the people funding this school are corporate criminals walking free without guilt? Should students ever have to wonder if their tuition money is being given back to a corporation providing the technology for genocidal activities to ensue? Unfortunately, in today's world, we do have to wonder pessimistically.

 We shouldn't have to worry about where our money is going but we should, and it's up to everyone to give themselves a voice and fight back against these corporations that are, in Siemens's case, ending lives.

Headline: THE SOAPBOX...An Op-Ed Column: Faculty parking woes
Author: Dionne Stephans / Special to the Beacon
&nbsp;
I am writing this letter to document an incident that occurred today at 11 a.m. in Lot 8 on FIU. I was driving looking for a spot when I saw a student in a black Toyota Four Runner exiting his car. As I have done several times in the past, I asked the student:  Are you a faculty or staff? And if not, this spot is for faculty and staff. The student told me he was not leaving and sat back in his car.

As this was occurring, I saw my colleague Gordon Finley, circling the lot; after waving at him several times I realized he was not having any more luck than me. 

I decided to stay where I was as it was the entrance to several rows of Faculty/Staff parking; I could easily get a free spot from this vantage if one became available. After about 10 minutes the student came out of his vehicle and approached my half open window. 

He proceeded to tell me in a combative tone how I was wasting time waiting for him (although I was not). I told the student that this is a faculty and staff spot that I pay over $40 a month to use. More importantly, I teach this evening on this side of campus until 9:05 p.m. and do not usually get to my car until 10 p.m. 

As such, I explained, it is also a safety issue as I always park my car close to my building on Tuesdays; further it is one of the best lots on campus. He continued to yell that he does not care, there are no other student spots available and he will not move as long as I am waiting there. This student also said he didn't care what I had to do at night it was not his problem there were not enough student spots. 

I was on the phone with a friend who heard his rant. She implored me to call campus police citing that no one at Virginia Tech expected that student to go off. At no point before he approached me had I left my car or said anything threatening to this student. The campus police arrived in minutes. They took my card that indicates my faculty status. The student greeted the African American officer with "What's up bro," without exiting the car. 

He left the spot after a short conversation, drove around to another row and held up his middle finger.

I finally arrived in my office and told my staff what had happened. All shared similar stories of students not only parking in Faculty/Staff spots, but more importantly, were the recipient of verbally abusive and aggressive students. 

I was informed by one victim that when she went to see the videos of her incident, only cameras facing the elevator and exits worked. FIU's parking and safety offices need to address this issue. Beyond the fact we are being charged significantly more than students to park, this has become a real safety problem. 

As I hear more and more stories that mirror my own I fear retaliation from this student, both in terms of physical attack or damage to my vehicle.  

I hope that FIU's arking and safety offices begins to take serious steps to address this serious safety issue. Aggressive students particularly toward women, should not be part of the campus community.

Headline: First local ethanol pump introduced
Author: Jessica Ariste / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The first E85 Ethanol pump in Miami opened Sept. 13, a day FIU and General Motors organized a forum to emphasize its importance.

This means that "consumers owning a [flex-fuel vehicle] can use E85 in the Miami area for the first time," said George Philippidis, director of the Center for Energy and Technology for the America's at FIU's Applied Research Center.

The new E85 pump is located in the U Gas station at 210 NW 79 Ave owned by Willie Urbieta, an alumnus of FIU's College of Business. 

"FIU's Energy Business Forum is promoting?fuel diversification," Philippidis said. "Biofuels, such as ethanol, are a key component of this strategy.??For consumers to be able to use E85 they need to have an FFV manufactured by companies such as?GM.? Hence the common interest in ethanol between FIU and GM."

Due to their common interests, FIU in developing new technology to make ethanol more abundant while GM continues producing flex-fuel vehicles, the University and GM organized the forum to announce the opening of the pump. 

According to Francisco Rivas, vice president of sales and marketing of Urbieta Oil Inc., and also an FIU graduate, FIU offered the University as the location to celebrate the forum in company of GM as a way to expose the necessity of ethanol and its benefits.

Although there is no direct connection between Urbieta and FIU, his being a former alumnus has helped in the collaboration between the two, Rivas said.

The change in the U Gas station did not come cheap. Urbieta told The Miami Herald that it is costing his family around $50,000 to change all the valves, hoses, nozzles and meters. Still, he plans to add E85 ethanol pumps to six of his 12 South Florida stations by the end of 2008.

The location for the next pump is currently under study because Urbieta wants to put it in a station by a zone where there are a substantial number of E85-compatible vehicles. The first pump was installed in the Mall of the Americas area because it has a lot of flex-fuel vehicle owners as well federal flex-fuel fleets, which are required to use ethanol when it is accessible.

Urbieta decided to make these changes both because he cares about the environment and sees a future in ethanol and because it will bring him financial compensation, said Rivas.

According to Rivas, the first ethanol pump in Miami is generating significant income because there are many of people using ethanol since it is so much healthier than gasoline for the environment.

He said that as ethanol use progresses it will not only be positive for the environment but will also create a new labor sector that will be in charge of the transformation of grain products into ethanol fuel.

Research and development of alternative fuel sources is necessary because according to the U.S. Department of Energy there will be an estimated 70 percent increase in world energy demands by 2030 due in part to growing economies like China and India.

FIU is helping to meet increasing energy demands.

Edward Glad, FIU professor of business, and Director of the Knight-Ridder Center for Excellence in Management, founded FIU's Energy and Business Forum in order to find different means of producing energy and therefore more autonomy for the Americas. 

Also, in February 2007, FIU's ARC and Florida's Crystal Corporation received a $1 million grant from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in order to develop cellulosic ethanol technology. Florida provided the grant so that FIU and the FCC could collaborate in finding a pretreatment process that can transform sugarcane bagasse into ethanol at a low cost.

Currently, more than 1,200 stations provide ethanol fuel in the United States, according to the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition and now Miami will join in the effort. 

 "With E85 coming to South Florida, it's the opportunity to take one of the largest consuming states and start to reduce gasoline consumption and lower greenhouse gases," said Dr. Mary Beth Stanek, the director of Environment and Energy at GM, to The Miami Herald.

Headline: Graduate Record Exam to change next month
Author: David A. Barrios / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Educational Testing Service announced that the Graduate Record Exam, or GRE, will change starting next month. 

Changes will include new question formats to the computer-based GRE in both its verbal and quantitive portions.

ETS had originally announced the changes last February, but decided against them in April.

But now it seems that ETS has made up its mind after it announced that changes will  take place after all starting Nov. 1. 

"This is an important step towards revising the General Test to offer improved measurement of the skills and knowledge required for graduate study," said Suzanne Ortega, dean of The Graduate School and vice provost of the University of Washington in Seattle and Chair of the GRE Board, in a press release. 

In the verbal section of the test, test-takers will now find new "text completion" questions asking students to fill in the blanks of given paragraphs. Every blank has its own list of words that can be put into the blank. Each word can significantly alter the nature of the paragraph and one wrong word inputted can make the overall answer incorrect.

The quantitive section will have new "numeric entry" questions, requiring test takers to manually input the answers of questions rather than choose them by the traditional multiple choice method.

But students planning to take the new GRE should not worry too much. 

A test-taker will only see one new "text completion" question or one new "numeric entry" question in the exam. There is also the possibility that they will not see any of the new questions at all. Also, when these questions are introduced in November, they will not count toward test-taker's scores until an "adequate sample of data" has been received.

However minor these changes may seem, they signify the beginning signs of a massive overhauling that the ETS is undertaking to improve the test.

Changes to the GRE originally included the elimination of the antonym and analogy questions and creating a more secure exam open only several times a year. The changes implemented as of now have not been as drastic as originally planned, with the ETS favoring a more gradual change in the coming years to the test rather than overly radical changes that could have exhausted their resources.

"Our advice is to take the exam sooner rather than later because ETS has said that these are the first of many changes involved. It's possible that the exam could get even more difficult over time" said Jennifer Kedrowski, GRE Program Manager for Kaplan Test Prep and Admissions.

Other changes to the GRE will affect student's pockets. 

Each year, the more than 555,000 people who sign up for the test have had to dish out a little more money.

 In 2005, the price for the test was $115.00 dollars, rising to $130.00 in 2006 and is currently at $140.00.

On Friday, Oct. 19, a free GRE practice test will be held at the University Park Campus in the Kaplan Center. Those interested should visit www.kaplan.com/gre.

Headline: Groups host 'coming out' day: Full day of events celebrate sexual diversity
Author: Amanda Massa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Every year the world remembers the struggle for equality and acceptance by having a day observing and recognizing gay rights.  

Celebrated every year during Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender history month, Oct. 11, National Coming Out Day serves as a way for individuals to "come out" to loved ones, friends and family in order to openly and freely with their sexuality. 

"It's a day to celebrate who we are as people as opposed to differences that exist among people," said Suzanne Onorato, associate director for the Women's Center.  

Despite budget cutbacks, Multicultural Programs and Services LGBT initiatives have planned an array of events for this year's celebration.

Coming Out Day is important because 364 days out of the year some people who LGBTQ feel like they are unable to be honest with the world about who they really are, Onorato said. 

The day-long events will begin at 9 a.m. in the Graham Center Pit, where students will have the opportunity to decorate a swatch of material for the Coming Out Day Quilt.

 Each swatch can be decorated however the individual wishes to represent themselves. 

Once completed, the quilt will be displayed at FIU in remembrance for the support shown for the LGBT community.  

A butterfly release and poetry reading is scheduled for noon at the fountain outside of GC. 

Two students will read poetry while an estimated 125 butterflies will be freed into the sky. 

Nadia Williams, graduate assistant for LGBT initiatives, told The Beacon that the butterfly release is "symbolic in how the butterfly goes through metamorphosis before it is able to fly." 

Following the butterfly release, there will be a reading of "coming out" monologues in the MPAS office, GC 216. 

The monologues will be presented by the members of Delta Lamda Phi, the only gay fraternity in all of Florida. 

A discussion on "coming out of the closet" will take place afterward. 

Along with MPAS, Student Programming Council, Resident Hall Association, Stonewall Pride Alliance, Delta Lamda Phi and the Women's Center have all joined as co-sponsors for these events. 

Stonewall Alliance is scheduled to present a motivational speaker and an evening event set to take place through RHA, but details on these are to be announced.

The event is open to the public, regardless of sexual orientation.

This year marks the 20-year anniversary since the Gay and Lesbian March in 1987, where over half a million gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and ally demonstrators stood for equality in D.C. That day was also the first time the NAMES Quilt was displayed, listing names of people who have died from AIDS.

Since then, the Human Rights Campaign has continued to work for equality by managing National Coming Out Day every year. 

The day is celebrated around the world.  

More information on LGBT initiatives and these events can be found in GC 216 at the University Park Campus and e-mails can be sent to lgbt@fiu.edu.

Suspects in hate crime may be innocent

Two of the men held in the beating of three FIU students are innocent, says Daniel Cabezas, FIU freshman, and victim of the alleged hate crime.

Five suspects were arrested Sept 28 for the beating of Cabezas, Christopher Eden, and Stephen Barrett, all FIU freshmen, after attending a private keg party at an island in the Intracoastal near Haulover, 10800 Collins Ave. The suspects were charged with a hate crime because they allegedly targeted Barrett, a black student.

Cabezas said that brothers Miguel Aranda and Jose Osorio were not involved in the beating after seeing their pictures in the Miami Herald and television newscasts. Cabezas confirmed that the other three teens were indeed involved in the crime, though the ringleader of the attack has not yet been apprehended.

Headline: EBay warns sellers, buyers of trading recalled toys on site
Author: Rachel Konrad / AP Wire
&nbsp;
EBay Inc. announced Oct. 2 that it is sending notices to sellers hawking recalled items, warning that they could be kicked off the Web site and may have to forfeit their fees.

The San Jose-based company, which listed 559 million items worth $14.46 billion last quarter, is also asking shoppers to be extra diligent about e-mailing or talking directly to sellers, and it's providing links to the government's database of recalled goods.

The warnings come after Mattel Inc. and smaller toy makers issued several high-profile recalls over the past few months involving at least 21 million toys because of concerns about lead paint or tiny magnets that could be swallowed.

On Oct. 2, a random check showed 111 listings on eBay for Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway, made by Oak Brook, Ill.-based RC2 Corp. 

That product was recalled late last month for excessive levels of lead. Sellers listed more than 6,000 Mattel items, including numerous products covered by government recalls.

EBay, which said it cannot police the millions of new and used items for sale on its site, is providing a tip sheet and hyperlinks to a recall database on its product category pages and in popular forums such as the Toy & Hobbies discussion board.

It's also partnering with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission to educate buyers about recalls.

''We see extra education as part of our responsibility in light of the recent toy recalls,'' said Catherine Schwartz, eBay's toy and gadget director. ''Listing items on eBay which have been recalled is strictly prohibited and if the CPSC asks eBay to remove an item, we will take it down.''

EBay, an online marketplace established in 1995, does not have its own inventory and prohibits numerous items but has little legal liability for products listed on its U.S. site.

Government watchdogs acknowledge they're still trying to figure out how to police and publicize recalls in the age of e-commerce.

''The rapid growth of online shopping exposes consumers to a different set of challenges in identifying potentially recalled or defective products being sold online,'' Acting CPSC Chairman Nancy Nord said.

EBay shares closed at $39.33, down 33 cents or less than 1 percent. In after-hours trading, they gained back 8 cents.

Headline: Feeling like an athlete without the workout: Fresh Food Co. provides
Author: David X. Rodriguez / Contributing writer
&nbsp;
Mick Smith, one of FIU's head strength and conditioning coaches, knows when an athlete hasn't been eating right not only from the athlete' honesty, but also from their strictly monitored weight.

According to Smith, if an athlete is found to be overweight, his or her workout program will be intensified. 

For this reason, athletes' diet is an important part of their daily lives.  

But to make sure that FIU athletes meet their daily vitamin, protein and energy needs, the Fresh Food Company, in cooperation with Smith and other strength and conditioning coaches, created last summer the Performance Corner, a place in the cafeteria where athletes can find the food they need. 

Athletes are expected to stick close to this meal plan so that they can stay physically fit and are often carefully watched by strength and conditioning coaches roaming the cafeteria. 

This meal plan was drafted by Aramark and then sent to the FIU Athletics Department to be analyzed by coaches. After adjusting and modifying it, the final meal plan was sent back to Aramark and it was finally implemented last summer.

The main adjustments made to the initial proposal from Aramark were to cut fatty foods out of the diet and to have at least 55 to 60 percent of the nutritional content be carbohydrates. 

"It needed to be a little more energy efficient," Smith said. 

The high-protein diet stresses the importance of having just the right amount of nutrients.

"We try to provide a balance," said Jonathan Garcia, resident district manager of Aramark

Not an athlete? Starting this Fall, the Performance Corner will be providing its alternative diet to everyone, allowing non-athletes to taste the carefully-carved athlete meal without having to go through the rigorous training.

Most of the transition to healthy food was pricey, but Aramark felt that it was necessary and much needed, Garcia said. 

Because the majority of food transitions took place in the past month, Aramark has not yet received a statement on costs, he added.

Garcia did assure, however, that although the implementation of the program cost Aramark money, the price for students has remained the same due.

The Performance Corner isn't the only place for special appetites at Fresh Food: vegans and vegetarians have a section that offers fresh tofu and soy products, while lactose-intolerants can enjoy lactose-free ice cream.

According to Garcia, Aramark is also offering healthier options for food already available at The Fresh Food Company, such as lean turkey bacon versus high-fat pork bacon. 

To help students determine the difference between what is healthy and what is not, Aramark has also included food scripts, located at every food station, enabling consumers to know exactly what they're eating and its nutritional value. 

Some describe what functions and roles vitamins and minerals in the meal serve.

"We educate customers as well," said Roger Clegg, director of operations with Panther Dining.

In an attempt to receive more student input, Aramark will be sending dining surveys to student's FIU e-mail next month.

Headline: Volleyball: Home SWEET HOME...Team breezes through first home series
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After a long five-week stretch on the road, a hungry women's volleyball team feasted on much anticipated home cooking at Pharmed Arena.

They dismantled their main course, the Troy University Trojans, with a 3-1 (30-16, 24-30, 30-23, 30-26) win in front of a ruckus home crowd Sept. 28.

For the fourth time this season, sophomores Olga Vergun and Yarimar Rosa both eclipsed the 20 kill mark - leading the Golden Panthers to their fourth consecutive win over the Trojans.

After the game, Rosa talked about having the Trojans' number and feeding off the home crowd.

"I think that we have more good players," she said. "We have good outside hitters, middle blockers, and we have defense. The other team only has two or three players that hit the ball hard, and we have like four or five that can really put the ball down. 

"I was really excited because the crowd was full and we were really happy to see that. Last year it wasn't like that for the first game, so it felt really good to see that strong support from our fans."

Feeding off the home crowd, the Golden Panthers roared out of the gates jumping out to a 10-1 lead in the first set. Vergun appeared to have an extra pep in her step and her aggressive play may have caught the Trojans off guard early. 

Between kills from Vergun, Rosa and freshman Ines Medved, the team looked poised to put the match away early - but that wasn't the case at all. 

All it took was a first set stomping to awaken the Trojans. The same squad that dragged their feet around the court and watched as the Golden Panthers started an early celebration looked like a completely different team in the second set. 

The Trojans jumped out to a 10-7 lead, landing a jab to the Golden Panthers' confidence. 

Anchored by their most potent offensive weapon, Meagan Gilroy, the Trojans never looked back as they locked the match at a set apiece.

After the second set letdown, the Golden Panthers reverted to the team that opened the game. With the anxiety of an eager fan base looming over the arena, the team bonded together to save its supporters the disappointment. 

With the score locked at 19 in the third set, Vergun exploded off the ground to rescue a ball heading out of bounds - spiking it to the floor between two stagnant Trojan players. That play ignited a 9-3 run for the Golden Panthers en route to winning the set. 

Even with momentum against them, Trojan coach Sony Kirkpatrick simply would not allow his team to quit without a fight. 

But, once again, the Golden Panthers would find an answer. 

Caught in another tight set, this time Rosa would deliver the dagger. 

With her team up 29-26, and the Golden Panther faithful on their feet, a floating Rosa pounded the ball from the left side of the court, landing a kill between Gilroy and outside hitter Jennifer White to seal the victory.

Vergun finished with a match-high 24 kills, hitting at a .462 clip. Rosa had 20 kills and Medved had a double-double with 10 kills and 10 digs in the win. 

Senior setter Keila Oliveira and freshman Natalia Valentin did a good job splitting sets with 36 and 23 assists, respectively.

Even in victory, Golden Panthers' head coach Danijela Tomic wasn't thrilled with the second set letdown.

"Obviously we are not there yet," said Tomic. "I think our problem is we get overconfident after we win the first game.

"I think this was a good lesson for us and I don't think we played well."

There was no such letdown a day later when the Golden Panthers made easy work of South Alabama (5-9) with a 3-0 (30-26, 30-27, 30-12) win. 

Once again, the team dominated a weaker opponent, setting the Jaguars down in straight games. The first two games were competitive, with the Golden Panthers just barely defeating the Jaguars, but they defeated them in a rout in the third game to finish the win.

Their weekend dominance pushed their record to 10-2 (5-0 Sun Belt) and earned Rosa Sun Belt Conference Player of the Week honors.

Rosa's selection as Player of the Week was the third of her collegiate career.

Headline: Commentary: Football team looked unprepared against Blue Raiders
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
At what point does the free fall end?

The nation-long 17-game losing streak began in Murfreesboro, Tenn., last season on Aug. 31, with a 7-6 loss to the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders.

On that day, the Golden Panthers were riding high with expectations, looking to build on a five-game winning streak that closed the 2005 season. Boasting one of the most talented squads in the Sun Belt Conference, they marched down the field, scoring easily against the Blue Raiders on the first drive of the season. 

The team failed to do anything on offense after that and the game became a microcosm of the entire season, a few stupid mistakes keeping victory out of reach.

If that meeting was a harbinger of things to come for the season, then the 47-6 whipping the Blue Raiders dished out to the Golden Panthers should serve as a wake up call for this team.

The Blue Raiders, sporting an 0-4 record, fresh off a 20-17 loss to Western Kentucky and starting a true freshman quarterback, looked to give the Golden Panthers an easier time than their previous four opponents, all BCS conference teams with combined records of 14-5. 

However, from the first time Blue Raiders quarterback Dwight Dasher took the ball, it was apparent that the team had no answer for the dual threat he brought with him. 

Dasher, making just his second career start, looked like Vince Young in the 2005 national championship game, scrambling and passing for 298 total yards in the first half, throwing three touchdowns and adding two more with his legs.

I don't know if the coaching staff had been planning for junior quarterback Joe Craddock IV, who missed the game with a back injury, but there was no excuse for the way the Blue Raiders caught the defense off guard. It wasn't simply an example of players missing assignments or MTSU slipping out of tackles and breaking off blocks exceedingly well, it was an entire squad looking flat out unprepared.

The offense faired no better, with starting quarterback Wayne Younger continuing his poor play. He amassed just 72 yards passing with two interceptions - one yard off of the school record for least passing yards in a game. Younger's legs, his supposed best weapon, proved to have no effect as he scrambled for just 11 yards.

Outside of the play of the quarterback, the offense simply couldn't do a thing. They didn't get into the red zone once during the entire game and only entered MTSU territory once, picking up an embarassing 145 yards of total offense.

You have to wonder how long coach Mario Cristobal can stick with Younger as his quarterback with fans calling for junior Paul McCall to see more snaps and true freshman Colt Anderson waiting in the wings as the future of the team. 

Younger, aside from a few drives scattered throughout the five games, has shown no reason to remain the starting quarterback and at some point a change has to be made.

From the standpoint of a fan, that was one of the most pathetic performances I have ever seen from a football team. Losing big to Penn State and Kansas is to be expected, but this team has shown they can at least play with some of the big boys, keeping things close against Miami and Maryland earlier on in the season.

But against a team that had failed to win a game so far, the Golden Panthers came out and gave a lackluster performance.

At this juncture in the season, is it a question of talent that is holding this team back or is there something else? It is the coaching staff's responsibility to make sure the players are mentally and physically ready to perform and it was apparent they weren't prepared for the onslaught the Blue Raiders brought.

If they ever hope to build the strong foundation for the program they have promised, it has to start with changing player's attitudes. Once they fell behind, the team showed very little fire to catch up and the blame for that has to lie with the coaches.

The team has the talent to compete in the Sun Belt, but the coaches have a responsibility to the players to make sure they are prepared.

Headline: Football Notebook: Last place offense faces Sun Belt foe Troy at home
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coming off a brutal 47-6 loss at Middle Tennessee State on Sept. 29, the 0-5 FIU Golden Panthers will be back at the Orange Bowl on Oct. 6 to take on the Troy Trojans. 

In the MTSU game, FIU went into halftime having given up a team record 47 points for a half. However, FIU did manage to outscore Middle Tennessee 6-0 in the second half, thanks to running back Chance Attaway's recovery of a fumble in the endzone when MTSU's punter missed the snap. 

FIU's Wayne Younger and A'mod Ned were each held to some of their lowest numbers this season with Younger passing for 72 yards and Ned rushing for just 33.

Troy is a formidable 3-2 team, with their only losses coming to Florida and Arkansas. Even in those loses, Troy managed to put up 31 points at Florida and 26 points  at Arkansas. 

The Trojans are lead by senior quarterback Omar Haugabook, who has passed for at least 200 yards in every game this season to go along with eight touchdowns. 

Haugabook is also a mobile threat with 219 yards, tallying five touchdowns on ground.

The same problems the Golden Panthers have faced in the first four games consistently seem to be hurting FIU. Offensively, FIU ranks last in Division I-A football in first downs, third- and fourth-down conversions and scoring. The teams ranks second to last in passing yards, ahead of only Navy's run-heavy offense.

On defense, none of the stats place FIU in last place, however in many key stats the team is hovering around the bottom 100, a real drop from last year's No. 28 rank.

With the way the team is currently performaning, an end to FIU's nation-long, 17-game losing streak may not be in sight this season. 

The offense will need to protect the ball better, as Troy's offense will take advantage of every opportunity. This will be an extremely tough test for the defense, as Troy is the defending Sun Belt Co-Champion with arguably the strongest offensive attack in the conference.

Following the Troy game, FIU will have its first bye week this season, giving the team a much needed break and a chance to strategize and rest injured players. 

However, the season is far from over. FIU still has seven games remaining on its schedule, six against Sun Belt teams and four of those games will be played at home in the Orange Bowl.

Headline: Men's Soccer: Offense fails to score goal in loss

&nbsp;
The struggles continued for men's soccer (0-7-2, 0-1-0) as it couldn't find a dose of luck in their Sun Belt Conference opener against Marshall (6-3-0, 1-0-0) Sept. 28. Another tough defensive showing was yet again unimportant as the offense continued to struggle in a close, one-goal loss. 

"The story of the season is that we can't score," said coach Munga Eketebi. "Mental lapses have hurt us more than anything." 

Marshall wasted no time in getting ahead as forward Kolby LaCrone was left right in front of the net unscathed to tap in what was the only score of the contest in the 12th minute. 

"We let a forward get behind us and he tapped it in," Eketebi said.

That was all Marshall would need in coming out victorious. Several FIU players put out strong efforts in trying to tie the score in the second half. 

Midfielder Juan Guerra let loose a strong shot just outside the penalty area but Marshall's goalkeeper Craig Ratanamorn was in good position to prevent a score. FIU forward Steven Cabas also had a good opportunity as he got fed a nice pass in the air from fellow forward Levi Coleman but his header sailed wide. 

The final true chance came in the 87th minute when Juan Guerra was denied by Ratanamorn again after a free kick off a Marshall foul. Ratanamorn would finish the game with seven saves.

FIU's defense truly has been the bright spot for what has been a deep struggle to start the year. Defender Brian Haisley made a few key plays and goalkeeper Kyle Thomas put forth a tough effort with five saves. 

"We just can't score goals," Eketebi said. "Unfortunately, there are no points for looking good. There are no points for defending well." 

The Golden Panthers have now lost four times by a 1-0 margin and have been shut out for the sixth time this season. They have also scored only five goals in nine games. 

Their next contest comes Oct. 7 at 1:00 p.m. against South Carolina in another home game. USC (6-3-0) represents another daunting task for FIU, but as past games have proven, if the offense can score and the defense can hold up, the team can upset a good team.

The Lady Toppers doubled their lead two minutes later as Walker would tack on an unassisted goal.

Even though the Golden Panthers defense halted the Lady Toppers By the second half, the 4-0 lead was insurmountable for the weak FIU offense.

In the 84th minute, the Lady Toppers recorded their final goal of the game to complete the offensive onslaught and defeat the Golden Panthers 5-0.



MSTU 3 FIU 0

Kaley Forrest doubled the Blue Raiders' lead with a chip shot five yards from the goal in the 60th minute.

One more goal in the 87th minute finished the scoring for the Blue Raiders as they shut out the Golden Panthers 3-0.

Headline: Commentary: Road, short roster lead women's soccer to winless weekend
Author: Ryan Abbey / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
We all know how important conference play is in college athletics. 

These games are really the games that decide how far a team's season will go, and they build reputation both in and out of the conference. 

That being said, it was obvious that the first two conference games for the Golden Panthers women's soccer team were meant to be building blocks for a strong conference run. 

Unfortunately, through the first two games the Sun Belt Conference has acted more like an actual belt, whipping FIU with eight goals, while holding the team scoreless.

The first game against Western Kentucky was doomed from the start, considering the first two goals were scored in the first four minutes.

 As a former player, I know the mindset changes completely after falling behind that quickly. The glass becomes nearly empty and the goal seems much smaller and further away than before. 

When the referee whistled a 5-0 loss, coach Thomas Chestnutt followed by saying Western Kentucky will be a tough conference opponent. 

In the second game, the women's soccer team seemed more focused and had a scoreless tie going into halftime. 

Whatever halftime adjustments Middle Tennessee made it was more than enough as two Lady Toppers scored their first goals of the season, as well as a third goal, leaving FIU with another scoreless loss and a very bad taste in its mouth. 

This also gave Middle Tennessee a weekend sweep in both football and women's soccer. 

It's obvious that some things went wrong during this road trip, and when things go wrong, everybody decides to do one of two things: assign blame or give the benefit of the doubt. 

This team can be given the benefit of the doubt.

Despite how bad things may look right now, all these problems have happened on the road. 

Once they can overcome their road troubles, this season will become much more productive. 

Playing on the road has its challenges and the learning curve for this young team is pretty steep. 

Also, opening conference play with two road games in three days is never an ideal situation. 

The schedule has not been helping the Golden Panthers thus far, but seven out of their nine remaining Sun Belt games will be played at home where the Golden Panthers are 2-1 this season. 

So there is a lot of room to regain ground and respect in this conference.

A short roster never helps a team's situation either. 

Two players are out with injuries this season - seniors Julie Mushill (ankle) and Francesca Chong (knee). 

Mushill is on the last part of her rehab, but Chong is starting a long and difficult rehab process from the devastating injury she sustained a few weeks ago. 

Once Mushill returns, the team will have five substitutes, but one of them is a goalkeeper, so really, at this point, there are just four available field players for substitution. 

This presents another problem because opponents are not afraid to send fresh legs onto the pitch and wear FIU down. 

There are multiple solutions for this, all of which are at coach Chestnutt's disposal. 

There should be no worries where that is concerned; he'll make the necessary adjustments.

It's funny because many people think that giving the benefit of the doubt is essentially making excuses for why things are the way they are right now. But these are just the facts of the current situation. 

Every team has circumstances here and there - some of them are out of the team's control. Yet it is the great teams that can rebound.

Headline: FEARLESS FASHION: FIU community shows disdain
Author: Nicolle Garber / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
For the first day of school, I decided to be less eccentric in what I wore. I put on my popular Lolita-style shoes, called Rocking Horse shoes. Almost three and a half inches in height, the shoe is a Mary Jane with a wooden platform and a block taken out from the back heel. 	

These shoes, as I expected, gathered every glare from the Graham Center as I walked through it's doors. It does not help that I'm a staggering 5'11 while wearing them either.  

It was almost like a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. First one stare, then another, and then another, until every person I walked by pecked at me with a glazed wide-eye filled with shock. 

Then came the snickering; but that was anticipated.  What wasn't expected though, were the rude stares and malicious remarks from some students.  

And then I thought, although I have the freedom to wear whatever I want, everyone around me makes me feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed.  

But why the anger-it is just clothing.

To makes matters worse, I dress in the Lolita style, a fashion sub-culture developed in Japan, where girls (and guys) assume a doll-like appearance. Lolita, bearing the same name as Vladimir Nabokov's deviant tale of romance between a young girl and an older man, is very far from what this fashion really is.  Do not get the two confused. 

Wearing Lolita in school is like being completely naked in front of 1,000 people.  Everyone stares. 

 Dirty looks, clusters of laughter, and distasteful comments thus ensue. 

 The students who don't respond negatively either compliment me or stare in bewilderment.  

Andres Bryan-Tamez, a friend of mine at FIU, doesn't understand the big deal. 

"It's just fancy, that's all." 

When I explained to him the negative criticism I had received, he was stunned, "Are we still in high school or something? Who does that?"  

When it comes to fashion, not everyone is as open-minded.  As I witnessed first hand, my experiences led me to believe that many FIU students do not tolerate a person's personal choice of clothing.  

Acceptance through fashion is a major reason why trends become trends.  

By dressing alike, a certain bond and familiarity is developed between virtual strangers. However, by deviating from the current fashion trend, people become pariahs. Isn't it odd though how most of the FIU population dresses somewhat similar? Skinny leg jeans and a t-shirt, jean skirts and a sweater; muted colors are the unofficial dress code of most students. 

 But who decided these clothes were okay 

to wear: you or a large corporation 



with attractive models on their billboards?  	And if you were given the choic to wear whatever you wanted to wear without fear of ridicule, would you?  

I am not the only Lolita in college. Hundreds of girls around the world-Belgium, Germany, Finland, Brazil, Spain, and of course America-wear Lolita.  And before we walk out the door, we brace ourselves  for the worst.  

And the worst is what we get.  Stories include girls being assaulted and harassed verbally and sexually.  

Nonetheless, wearing something completely different from the norm does not entitle students nor anyone to become offensive.  Staring is acceptable to a certain degree-we all stare at things we've never seen before.  

There needs to be a more open-minded approach to personal choices in clothing.  

Either way, regardless of how many students find my style ridiculous and worthy of ridicule, I persevere, fearlessly.

Headline: Power struggle over tuition increase
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Last week's announced tuition increase of 5 percent  for all Florida public universities holds a significance to students far beyond the extra money that will be shelled out every semester.

The increase, mandated by the Board of Governors, marks the first time a tuition hike was instituted by the governing body of the State University System rather than the Florida Legislature. This action has caused debate, and even a lawsuit, over whether the Board has the right to modify tuition.

In an attempt to reduce the state's budget, Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Legislature have stated through their actions that Florida universities are the lowest priority. The Beacon reported last month that more than a quarter of all cuts affect FIU students and our colleagues at ten other public institutions in the state. FIU itself received more cuts than any other school.  Clearly, state universities need more money, as each one has felt the effects of the crunch from enrollment caps eliminating programs.

Why then should the Legislature, which has proven its disregard for the university system, have complete control over its finances? This is especially true considering that the Legislature is freely able to favor other programs over education, leaving students with the bill. 

During the 2002 election, Florida voters mandated the Board of Governors via constitutional amendment to control public universities. Such a board makes sense, so that the important issues facing Florida's students, faculty, and staff are controlled by people directly involved with the schools, rather than legislators with a myriad of special interests. 

Surprisingly, lawmakers are not eager to give up power.  State Representative Steve Olerich is a prime example. He told The Palm Beach Post that the legislature needed a hand in the decision to raise rates. He is forgetting, though, that the legislative branch did have their say when they confirmed the members of the Board of Governors.. But after Governor Crist and his legislature picks the members of the Board, they need to step back and let the qualified individuals make their own decisions. By doing so, they would honor the voters' demands and relinquish the right of tuition control solely to the Board of Governors. 

The Board of Governors, unlike the legislature, is not simply a panel of politicians.  Its members are invested in the success of the university system and include the President of the Advisory Council of the Faculty Senate, the Commissioner of Education, and the Chair of the Florida Student Council.

A push for the Board of Governors to commandeer control over tuition is in the form of a lawsuit filed by former governor and U.S. Senator Bob Graham. His record of interest in educational issues and voluntarily teaching a semester at an urban high school during his term in the state Senate makes him the perfect person to spearhead this transition. Hopefully, when the dust settles, the Board will emerge with more power, and the sense to use it wisely.
