Headline: Which team will win Super Bowl XXXIX? (part 1)
Subheadline: Patriots
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Bill Belichick. He's the reason why the New England Patriots are going to win their third Super Bowl in the last four years. 

Rated the number one football head coach by Sports Illustrated, no coach is as innovative and knowledgeable of the game as Belichick is.  The Patriots come into the game with two rings in the last three years. The Philadelphia Eagles on the other hand, come in with no rings in the history of the NFL.

The Eagles are a team full of chokers, players that can't handle the pressure. Before defeating the Falcons, the Eagles lost three consecutive NFC championships. 

Their leading player and quarterback, Donovan McNabb, couldn't handle the pressure to lead the team. You can argue that all he needed was a wide receiver and that this year he has one in Terrell Owens, but come on: How effective can Owens be on one good ankle? Besides, like Rush Limbaugh said, McNabb is overrated.

All the hype has been about how Owens is going to come in and blow the Patriots defense away.  Are the Eagles trying to stage T.O. as a god? They must be, if all they keep saying is that he is injured and not cleared to play medically, but that he will still play in the Super Bowl, regardless of what doctors say.

The Patriots come into the Super Bowl after having defeated the second and third best team in the AFC. The Patriots are first of course.

 Both the Colts (12-4) and Steelers (15-1) are better teams than the two the Eagles defeated, the Vikings (8-8) and Falcons (11-5). The Eagles have yet to play as a team, unlike the Patriots. They are dependent on Owens and whether he will play or not. However, New England is not depending upon a single player.

They will play without their top cornerback, Ty Law and with a limping Richard Seymore. In New England though, the talk is not about whether or not they can play without Law. It doesn't matter to them. They play as a team and Bilichick can win with anyone. 

Law got hurt and Bilichick inserted wide receiver Troy Brown at corner. What's the end result you may ask? Brown finished with three interceptions on the season, more than Miami Dolphins star Sam Madison.

That approach by both Belichick and his players has led the Patriots to a 33-four record over the last 37 games. This season alone, he has used 40 different players as starters. 

When the Patriots beat the Eagles next Sunday, they will become only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years. That qualifies as a dynasty.

Headline: Baseball sweeps FAMU in season opener
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After their night season-opener was postponed by rain, the baseball team began the season with a double-header on Jan. 29. Luckily for the Golden Panthers, the team was able to come out with a sweep of FAMU at University Stadium. 

Senior David Asher led the pitching department in the first game with a complete game shutout. Sophomore Cody Jacobs led FIU offensively with two homeruns and five RBIs in a 6-0 victory.

Later in the afternoon, Elih Villanueva added a solid performance by allowing just two runs in six innings of work. Dennis Diaz went 3-for-3 with an RBI and a stolen base in the 5-3 victory.

In game one, redshirt junior Nick Cadena started the second inning with a single that Jacob followed with a homerun to left field to give FIU a 2-0 lead. In the forth inning, Cadena scored again  the score 3-0, off a single by junior Randy Youtsey to make it 3-0. 

The score didn't change until the eighth inning when Jacobs connected on his second homerun, a three-run blast that hit the scoreboard in left field to give FIU the 6-0 lead.

"We've been working all year on getting our foot down early and reacting to the pitch," said Jacobs.

Asher was proud by the play of his teammate.

"I got a lot of run support, [especially from] my catcher Cody Jacobs with his two homeruns," said Asher.

In Asher's first career complete game shutout, he struck out seven, walked none and allowed seven hits. 

"I wasn't  expecting to pitch the whole game. It was the first game of the season and I was just hoping on getting in some work," Asher said.

In the second game, with FIU down 1-0 in the top of the first, the team answered back in the bottom of the inning with an RBI single by junior Michael Lopez and another by Diaz in the second to take a 2-1 lead.

In the forth inning, after stealing third base, Cadena scored on a throwing error by FAMU to make it 3-1.

FIU then added two more runs in the fifth inning to take a 5-2 lead. Junior Yosvel Barroso started the inning with a double to left field and then moved over to third base on a sacrifice bunt. He then scored on an RBI single by junior Yahmed Yema. Yema then scored off another FAMU error, their fourth of the game. 

FAMU kept it close with a solo homerun off in the eight off junior relief pitcher Matt Rainey, to make it 5-3. Rainey pitched two innings of relief, striking out one and allowing two hits and the aforementioned run.

Senior Danny Hernandez took the mound in the ninth inning and closed out the game with two strikeouts.

Starting pitcher Villanueva, in his first collegiate start, tallied six strikeouts, allowed five hits and walked one batter.

&nbsp;
Going into Super Bowl week, the first person that came to my mind was Willis Reed. I know. Isn't that crazy? Why would a basketball player who hasn't played in three decades come to mind when I think of the biggest football game of the year?

For those who don't know, Willis Reed has become synonymous in the sports world with team inspiration. In 1970, he almost single-handedly led the New York Knicks team to the NBA finals. 

Then, against the mighty L.A. Lakers in a best-of-seven series, Reed was injured in the fourth quarter of game five (his team still won). 

However,  without him the Knicks were demolished in game six.

The series came down to the decisive seventh game, and there was much doubt about Reed's ability to play. Without Reed, the Knicks had no chance.

So when Reed limped onto the court, minutes before tip-off, the crowd erupted. He even won the tip-off and scored New York's first four points of the game. 

However, those would be the only points he would score. But it did not matter, because just the sight of the limping Reed walking onto the court, putting his career on the line, was enough to motivate his team to do the rest and win the NBA title.

This is why I believe the Philadelphia Eagles will win the Super Bowl . Terrell Owens is the Eagles' Willis Reed.

I know that some people will say that Owens will be ineffective, but does that really matter? Think about it. If Owens doesn't play, all Bill Belichick has to do is concentrate on stopping Philly's running game. 

Now with Owens on the field, Belichick has to worry about whether Philly is using him as a decoy or if they are actually going to throw to him. This opens up Philly's options and gives them a legitimate chance of winning.

Yes, I know the Patriots have the best coach on the field, but the coach isn't out there playing the game. In the Patriots' loss to the Miami Dolphins, Belichick was in no means out-coached. His players were just outplayed. Not even a genius head coach can help you there.

Another reason I'm picking against the Pats is that they are the Dolphins' division rivals. As the saying goes, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." 

Even though you may hate Terrell Owens and all his chicanery, you have to admire a guy who will go out on the field with two screws in his ankle and risk permanently damaging it. 

The Eagles will win and we all know who Willis Reed will be rooting for on Sunday.

Headline: FIU picks up SBC win in fifth overtime
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Forty minutes of play couldn't decide the winner on Jan. 30 at Pharmed Arena. As a matter of fact, neither could 45, 50, 55 or 60. However, 65 did.   

The Golden Panthers men's basketball team ended their seven-game losing streak, and more importantly, notched their first conference win of the season. The only catch-it took five extra periods of overtime. 

FIU didn't make a basket in the fifth overtime. Luckily enough for coach Sergio Rouco, the team converted 15 free throws and won 118-114. That's how Rouco marked his first career Sun Belt victory. 

Other players achieved the same in different ways. Freshman guard Antonio Jones played his first significant minutes of the year and had a crucial role in the fifth and deciding overtime. He went a perfect 10-of-10 from the free throw line in the game, including 6-of-6 in the deciding session. 

Rouco was proud of his team and the way they fought to win the game.

"A winner is one who overcomes adversity," Rouco said. "That's what we're trying to teach this team and tonight they learned a valuable lesson. Tonight, we found a way to win against one of the top teams in the Sun Belt Conference. This is a great win for this program right now."

Junior Ismael N'Diaye led FIU with a career and team high 34 points on 10-of-18 shooting from the floor and 5-of-9 from behind the arc in 59 minutes of play. 

"It was the most exciting game I have ever played," N'Diaye said, following the victory. "This win really put us back to where we wanted to be."

Ivan Almonte, in physical pain due to cramping during most of the final three periods, completed his eighth double-double of the year, finishing with 26 points and 16 rebounds. His most dramatic three points however, came right at the end of the first overtime. 

Following an inbounds pass with less then 10 seconds to play in the first overtime, Jones found Junior Matias who threw up a three-point attempt only to hit the rim. Incredibly, the ball fell into the hands of Almonte, who in one motion, not only collected his 10th rebound, but threw up an off-balance three off the glass to force overtime number two. 

"I knew it was on time," said Almonte. "But I thought they would call a travel or something. It was just crazy. When I threw the ball up, I didn't even think it was going to go in, but it did." 

Although that play may steal much of the attention of the game, FIU was put in that position only because of something that happened during the second half. 

The Golden Panthers, who had trailed by eight, 37-39, at halftime, found themselves trailing by as much as 14 halfway through the second frame. Rouco's men then changed the course of the game.

With eight minutes left to play, the Golden Panthers clawed their way back into the game with an 18-1 run led by Almonte and Matias and took their biggest lead of the game at 67-64. 

N'Diaye connected on two three pointers in the third overtime to give the Golden Panthers a one point lead, 96-95, with 1:23 to play. Following a lay-up by Zack Wright which gave the lead back to the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, Almonte went up for a shot and fell hard on his knee. Matias took the two free throws, connecting on just one to tie the game at 97. 

Byron Burnett claimed the rebound with authority, but to the displeasure of the crowd the Golden Panthers could not convert and turned the ball over on a shot clock violation with 5.2 seconds to play. 

UALR in-bounded the ball with seconds left in the third overtime following a timeout, but they missed a jumper, and thus forced the fourth extra session.  

Warren Gale, taking two free throws for an injured Almonte, made one, giving the Golden Panthers a two-point lead with 21 seconds to play on fourth victory. Trojan Brandon Freeman then converted on a long jumper with his foot on the line to tie the game as time expired in the fourth overtime. The deadlock continued at 103 heading into the seventh frame of the game. 

The five overtimes were two short of the NCAA record of seven set between Cincinnati and Bradley on December 21, 1981.

"I liked was that our guys were back smiling again, even when we were down in the second half," Rouco said.

FIU battled with only nine eligible players on the bench; junior guard Julius Eppinger quit the team following a lack of playing time and fellow teammate Sheldon Bailey was suspended indefinitely earlier in the week by Rouco for an undisclosed violation of team rules.  

With the win in front of a season-low in attendance of 640, the Golden Panthers move to 8-12 on the season and 1-6 in the conference, while the Trojans move to 12-8 on the season and 4-4 in Sun Belt Conference play.

Headline: Ice goes down in flames
Subheadline: Rapper Ice Cube has changed from lyric busting gangster to star of family films in one short decade.
Author: Danny Muela / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I realized not too long ago, that I am white. It's something that most dazzling suburbanites like myself must realize in order to have some sort of cultural identity and focus when it comes to dealing with people and situations in life. 

I would like to add that even though I am indeed whiter than Mr. Rogers in a blizzard, I know selling out when I see it. The term "selling out" gets thrown about a lot these days, and half the time it isn't justified. 

It's mostly uptight indie kids who use the term out of fear that a band that only they know about will suddenly become known to the public. Do they think the band will spontaneously combust or something if that happens?

But I believe that at this point the individual whom I will accuse of selling out has pressed his fans long enough and deserves to be called out.

I am of course talking about Ice Cube. Remember NWA? Remember Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Arabian Prince, and Mr. Cube himself? I don't think they really need an introduction. They were all about rebellion, anger, justice, The Raiders and essentially killing Whitey altogether. In the early 90's this whole movement of pissed off young people helped define a generation. Between NWA and Public Enemy, young blacks finally got a taste of their parents' and grandparents' defiance. 

 Needless to say, they were all hardcore. But what happened to Ice Cube? The Man, that's what happened. The Man wasn't selling enough of his crappy movies, so he had to take one of urban America's legends to hock his product to get a new demographic. 

"Are We There Yet?" was the number one movie in America last weekend, mostly because it's February and all the good movies are on the back burner until after the Oscars. But think about it, America is embracing Ice Cube. Something just doesn't seem right when Debbie St. Clair of Kalamazoo, Mich. can look in the paper and say "Ice Cube has a new movie out? Well, hot damn. We got to get all the kids together for this one."

"Friday" was funny and "Next Friday" was cool, "Friday after Next" was just pushing it. I would rather see 100 more "Friday"s than one family comedy starring Ice Cube. I mean, what's next? Snoop Dogg doing the voice of an actual dog in a movie about a zebra who wants to be a race horse? Oh wait ... that's right, he really does that in "Racing Stripes." How could I forget that?

But I guess you can't blame the rappers for this type of behavior. The only ones you can really blame (other than The Man of course) are the children of rappers. 

Rappers from that era are now starting families, and I don't think they really want their kids seeing some lady that isn't mommy rubbing all over daddy. So they make stuff like "Racing Stripes" and "Are We There Yet?" to fool their children into thinking they are just messing around when they go off to work. 

Oh well. When those children get older and find all those copies of "F*** The Police" at their nearest record store listed as "Oldies," they'll wise up, and therapy isn't that bad anyway.

So if I were to somehow become Ice Cube's manager, I think the next move we would make is to shake things up a bit and reunite NWA. Sure some of them aren't even alive anymore, but if Queen can hit the road without Freddy, then NWA can come back without Eazy.

Subheadline: Change in fraternity recruitment efforts proves positive for all students and faculty
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
FIU students and faculty might have noted a change in front of Graham Center at University Park during the past two weeks. Recruitment for fraternities was held in the Betty Chapman Plaza instead of inside GC as it has been for the past several years. The change may not seem so important, but for those that have been at FIU for more than one semester, the change is very significant.

Having the fraternity tables outside is a win-win situation. Usually, Rush Week means an even more crowded GC - that means more noise, congestion and commotion. This is especially tiring for those who are in a hurry and aren't interested in taking part in rush activities. With the tables outside, the GC hallways become less of an obstacle and the building is less noisy. 

It was an improved rush experience. The fraternities enticed students with food, party invitations and this semester, the idea of hanging out with a group of easy-going guys  lounging on shaded chairs in beautiful January weather. 

Rush Week as an outdoor activity makes fraternities all the more interesting and approachable to potential rushees. "There were 11 fraternities out there. We had officially planned to hold recruitment inside Graham Center, but it was over-booked with other events and vendors, so we decided to set up our tables outside," said Greek Affairs assistant, Roderigo Duarte.

 On a low note, the fraternities made a pretty big mess outside. Most of the leftover food, bottles and papers were not cleaned up until early this week. So try and keep things a little more tidy next time, OK, guys? 

Although Rush Week recruitment was outdoors only because GC was booked, we hope that the Greeks continue to keep their Rush Week tables outside for many years to come. It makes for a more enjoyable experience for everybody, even those not involved with Rush Week.

&nbsp;
Were you a victim of the slap bracelet fad in elementary school? 

How about the pog phenomenon, or that Magic-card madness? 

Have you ever owned a CD by Chumbawumba? 

If you answer yes to one or more of these questions, then www.facebook.com is for you. 

The Facebook is an online directory that connects people through social networks at colleges. 

Allison Shuffield, a sophomore at Florida State University put it simply: "It's like being in the first grade again. Can we be friends? Circle yes or no." Up until my discovery of The Facebook, that was my system for making friends.

Getting started is no more complicated than finding parking at FIU. Simply log on, sign up using your school e-mail address and enter all of your personal information. You can enter anything from your major and your screen name to your sexual orientation or whatever emo poetry makes you cry this week. 

Once you're finished, congratulations! You've just established a quick and easy way for someone to effectively stalk you.

Unlike similar websites such as Friendster or Myspace, The Facebook only allows students of the same school to view each other's pages. The process of acquiring friends is time consuming, yet necessary to becoming a committed member of this online niche. 

Trust me though, it's worth it because this site will so get you laid. But you have to play your cards right. This is why I am going to briefly give you...

THE DO'S AND DON'TS OF FACEBOOK



DO 



*  put "Fight Club" as one of your favorite movies. Everyone loves "Fight Club," even if you have never seen the entire movie.

* list bands no one has ever heard of as your favorite music. It makes you cooler. People who do not know you will think you are unique. Well, at least people will think you are cool until they find out you only saw the name of the band because you accidentally typed in "Coldplan" instead of "Coldplay" on Kazaa.

* post a picture of yourself chugging liquor straight from the bottle. This shows you have a fun, wild side and that you don't spend all your time on The Facebook. Also, if you have any photos of yourself drunk and riding a shopping cart, put those up too. Or, you can just rotate these pictures weekly (since you can only post one at a time) to demonstrate that you are definitely are not obsessed with The Facebook.



DON'T



*   put "Whatever I Can Get" when they ask you what kind of relationships you want. Being a member of this site is a sign that you'll take whatever you can get.             

* forget to look at your wall. (The wall is the part of your page where friends can post comments about you.) Once, it took me two weeks to realize someone had gone on my page and written, "Dara, you left your diapers at my house. I'll leave them in the mailbox." Of course, everyone had seen my wall before I had.

* send out mail to entire groups. This is annoying (and will not get you laid). No matter how profound or remarkable you think your thoughts are, nobody cares. Plus, signing on The Facebook and getting excited over having a message, only to find it's a mass e-mail someone sent to the world, makes that person a killjoy. And definitely do not send chain letters or "Thoughts of the Day." That's what middle school was for. 

Another wonderful thing about Facebook is that anyone can create a group about anything they want. A group is simply a feature of the site that allows you to join a forum with other people who have similar interests. 

There are tasteful ones, like "Class of 2007" or "The Harry Potter Fan Club," but let's face it; it is more fun to join a group with a name like "Addicted to Booty."

Alethea Perez, a junior at FIU, enjoys the amusing variety of the different groups. 

"I'm proud to be a Facebook member. Whether I want to be a member of the 'I Am on Facebook to Get Laid' group or even the 'Bush Sux' group, anything I could possibly be interested in or offended by is available at my disposal." 

For those of you who are already addicted to The Facebook, you have probably accepted that your infatuation is everlasting.  

My sincere apologies to those of you who unearth The Facebook after reading this article. The decline in your grades and social life will plague my conscience and probably drive me to drink. Be sure to look for pictures of me riding a shopping cart. With that said, I have to admit I enjoy the simplicity of reconnecting with old friends on The Facebook. 

It's likely that I'll never talk to the random high school peers I have declared friendships with on Facebook, but nonetheless, the site offers a strange sense of continuity - proof that life after high school did not end and then restart in a different realm. 

The Facebook is what you make of it.  Whether you choose to be an over-obsessed visitor, a sleazy group junkie or just a normal college student enjoying your ability to reconnect with your middle school sweethearts, I encourage you to sign on. 

Who knows?  We can even rendezvous online after you check out my page and spot me on campus. Don't forget to thank me for helping you get laid.

Headline: SPOTLIGHT ON
Subheadline: FIU Book Club
Author: Luis Nin / Illustrator
&nbsp;
There's something about getting books assigned in class that takes the joy out of reading. After several dry lectures and rampant over-analyses, even the most enjoyable books begin to lose their appeal. In their search to give books meaning, many professors completely lose sight of their entertainment value. The FIU Book Club believes in a different approach to reading. They read because it's fun.

Founded by club president, Joel Marino, for the Fall 2003 semester, the FIU Book Club created a small community for students to enjoy and discuss books among themselves.

The book club is officially named Cellar Door. 

"I wanted a catchy name for the club ... it couldn't be just 'The FIU Book Club," said Marino. "I was lying in bed a week before last spring semester started, thinking of a name. I was in that delirious mood between sleep and being awake, when I began to think of the movie 'Donnie Darko.' In the movie, Drew Barrymore plays a liberal high school English teacher who is fired." 

According to Marino, before Barrymore is fired in the movie, she writes on the chalk board "Cellar Door." The main character, Darko, finds her and she tells him that a writer once said it was the most beautiful phrase in the English language. 

Marino looked up Barrymore's accusation, and found that both J.R.R. Tolkien and H.L. Mencken shared that view. Marino says he couldn't get that out of his head and decided to stick with the phrase as the name of the book club. 

After a brief hiatus in 2004, the FIU Book Club is ready to start reading again. Marino believes that there is an overwhelming need for the club at FIU.

"We needed a book club run by students where we can discuss the books we want to discuss and where we can talk about them the way we want to. There are no papers or tests. Everything's free to interpretation, so there's no way anyone can be wrong," Marino said. 

Freshman Kathleen Oliva also sees the need for an FIU book club.

"I think FIU does a pretty good job at creating thoughtful discussion and motivating students to think with events such as its lecture series, but it could be more active," she said. "The fact that the only active book club on campus until now was the Women's Studies book club is proof enough. We also see a lot of different student clubs based on common ethnicity or religion, but there are not very many of them that focus solely on intelligent discussion or thoughtful issues."

Last fall, the FIU Book Club read Dan Brown's "The DaVinci Code." The book's overwhelming popularity made it the clear choice when the club was deciding on its reading material. 

Club Treasurer Kenneth Rojas enjoyed discussing "The DaVinci Code" with the book club. "We had a real sense of giving it our own direction. The discussions were alot less constricted in terms of thought. We were free to go on different paths and develop different ideas," Rojas said.

The club enjoyed the advantages of meeting together to discuss the book. 

Together, members analyzed the deeper meanings and allusions in the novel, something they wouldn't have been able to do if they read the book by themselves.

"We talked about the Merovingians, the history of Arthur and his quest, symbols within the paintings, etc. I did all my research," Marino said.

This semester, the book club is scheduled to read "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel. In this novel the son of a zookeeper  gets caught in a horrible shipwreck and becomes stranded in the middle of  the Pacific Ocean on a 26-foot lifeboat in shark infested waters. Accompanying him is a 450 lb. Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. 

According to Marino, oddly enough, the story hinges on religion. The main character is simultaneously Muslim,  Hindu and Christian and must come to terms with his beliefs as he tries to survive the perilous 227-day journey across the Pacific Ocean. 

"Life of Pi" won one of the most prestigious awards in literature in 2002, the Man Book Prize. But despite its intriguing plot and critical acclaim, it seems like an odd selection for the club. Compared to "The DaVinci Code," "Life of Pi" is an obscure novel. Most people haven't heard of. 

When asked why he chose "Life of Pi" for the Book Club's reading this semester, Marino explained, "I read the back of the book, and I was fascinated by the plot. I thought, 'Well, "DaVinci Code" tackles religion, and so does this book. Why not follow that trend a bit?' It seems to be what a lot of college kids are preoccupied with these days."

Oliva eagerly anticipates reading "Life of Pi" with the FIU book club.

"I think between the stress of textbooks and assigned reading, people forget the value of real literature and what it is to read for leisure and interest. It is important for students to make time for a book they really have an innate interest in," Oliva said. 

The FIU Book Club's first meeting will be next Thursday, Feb. 10, at 3:30 p.m. in the Bookstore Café in GC at University Park. For more information, e-mail bookclub@fiu.edu.

* post a picture of yourself chugging liquor straight from the bottle. This shows you have a fun, wild side and that you don't spend all your time on The Facebook. Also, if you have any photos of yourself drunk and riding a shopping cart, put those up too. Or, you can just rotate these pictures weekly (since you can only post one at a time) to demonstrate that you are definitely are not obsessed with The Facebook.



DON'T



*   put "Whatever I Can Get" when they ask you what kind of relationships you want. Being a member of this site is a sign that you'll take whatever you can get.             

* forget to look at your wall. (The wall is the part of your page where friends can post comments about you.) Once, it took me two weeks to realize someone had gone on my page and written, "Dara, you left your diapers at my house. I'll leave them in the mailbox." Of course, everyone had seen my wall before I had.

* send out mail to entire groups. This is annoying (and will not get you laid). No matter how profound or remarkable you think your thoughts are, nobody cares. Plus, signing on The Facebook and getting excited over having a message, only to find it's a mass e-mail someone sent to the world, makes that person a killjoy. And definitely do not send chain letters or "Thoughts of the Day." That's what middle school was for. 

Another wonderful thing about Facebook is that anyone can create a group about anything they want. A group is simply a feature of the site that allows you to join a forum with other people who have similar interests. 

There are tasteful ones, like "Class of 2007" or "The Harry Potter Fan Club," but let's face it; it is more fun to join a group with a name like "Addicted to Booty."

Alethea Perez, a junior at FIU, enjoys the amusing variety of the different groups. 

"I'm proud to be a Facebook member. Whether I want to be a member of the 'I Am on Facebook to Get Laid' group or even the 'Bush Sux' group, anything I could possibly be interested in or offended by is available at my disposal." 

For those of you who are already addicted to The Facebook, you have probably accepted that your infatuation is everlasting.  

My sincere apologies to those of you who unearth The Facebook after reading this article. The decline in your grades and social life will plague my conscience and probably drive me to drink. Be sure to look for pictures of me riding a shopping cart. With that said, I have to admit I enjoy the simplicity of reconnecting with old friends on The Facebook. 

It's likely that I'll never talk to the random high school peers I have declared friendships with on Facebook, but nonetheless, the site offers a strange sense of continuity - proof that life after high school did not end and then restart in a different realm. 

The Facebook is what you make of it.  Whether you choose to be an over-obsessed visitor, a sleazy group junkie or just a normal college student enjoying your ability to reconnect with your middle school sweethearts, I encourage you to sign on. 

Who knows?  We can even rendezvous online after you check out my page and spot me on campus. Don't forget to thank me for helping you get laid.

Headline: Insurgents fail to derail Iraqi election
Author: Tom Lasseter / Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
Iraq's first democratic elections in 50 years were marred by 10 suicide bombers. Forty-four people were reported killed and untold numbers of mortar shells rained down on polling sites and the nation's government center.

Because the death toll fell far short of what many had feared, the voting was a clear political victory for U.S. and Iraqi security forces. It was unclear, however, whether the insurgents were foiled by Iraqi security forces and by the 150,000 U.S. troops conducting aggressive operations or whether most of them took the day off to wait for better times, places and targets.

"The streets of Baghdad were not filled with blood as mentioned by the terrorist groups," said Farid Ayar, an official with the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq.

Like many others in Iraq, Ayar seemed to be hedging his bets. The elections were a political win for the interim Iraqi government and the American administration that backs it, but few Iraqis or Americans were prepared to declare the insurgency defeated.

Thaer al Naqib, a spokesman for interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, was less reserved.

"Today the terrorists lost the war," he said. "It is a historic victory for Iraqis."

While the insurgents failed to derail the elections, they succeeded in dictating how the voting was conducted. No civilian cars were allowed on the streets because of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Iraqis killed by car bombers in the past year. Top Iraqi officials, guarded by phalanxes of Western security contractors, cast their votes in a compound guarded by Bradley fighting vehicles and American soldiers.

There's still deep-rooted worry that the vote could spark more violence between a now-disenfranchised Sunni Muslim minority and the long-oppressed Shiite majority that's almost certain to dominate the results.

Polling centers in the dangerous Sunni towns south of Baghdad, Mahmudiyah and Latafiyah, were closed until early afternoon because of security concerns, according to election officials. In Fallujah, to the west, the same reason kept 100 of a planned 140 sites closed all day. Insurgents attacked polling stations in Baqubah, another Sunni hotspot, at least 30 times during a 24-hour period, though most of the attacks didn't inflict any casualties.

Iraqi security forces, however, cut other potential attacks off at the pass by tightly controlling the areas around the polling stations, albeit with ample help from American military officials and U.S. troops who remained largely out of sight, if not out of mind.

By the end of the day, nine insurgents wearing suicide belts and a car bomber, along with mortar and other attacks, killed more than 40 people. In a country where coordinated attacks have killed more than 140 people in one day, it was an acceptable number.

Department of Theatre and Dance production selected for regional festival

The Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival (KCACTF) has selected FIU's production of "Romeo and Juliet: The East West Project" to perform at this year's Region IV Festival in February. The play is one of seven that will be performed at the prestigious festival, after being selected through a competitive process.

The KCACTF, which was founded by Roger L. Stevens in 1969, is a national theater program that involves about 18,000 college students nationwide. It has served as a catalyst in improving the quality of college theater in the United States.

Each year, during January and February, regional festivals showcase the best productions entered and offer a variety of activities, including regional-level awards and programs. Three judges, who were selected to serve the KCACTF national committee, invite four to six of the best and most diverse artistic performances to invite to showcase at the regional festivals, all expenses paid.

One of this year's seven showcases that the judges selected is the Department of Theatre and Dance's production of "Romeo and Juliet: The East West Project." Directed by associate professor Phillip Church, the play is set in a modern-day Muslim-American community and tells the story of two lovers and their struggle to be together despite the ethnic differences of their families, who are opposed to the match.

U.S. soldiers opposed to Iraq war seek refuge in Canada

Jeremy Hinzman, paratrooper-turned-Iraq war deserter, has a lot in common with the thousands of Vietnam War-era draft dodgers who poured into Canada decades ago. Like them, he sought asylum in a country that did not support a U.S.-led conflict, to avoid fighting what he deemed an illegal war.

But the lean, eloquent South Dakota native was not drafted. He voluntarily enlisted in the Army four years ago to "serve a higher purpose" and have college tuition paid.

Now, one year after fleeing Fort Bragg, N.C., with his young family only weeks ahead of his platoon's deployment to Iraq, Hinzman is waiting for a Canadian tribunal to decide whether he is a refugee for refusing to fight. Hinzman's hearing was held in December, and a decision is expected next month.

Japan may donate anime programs to Third World

The Foreign Ministry is considering providing popular anime programs for free to television stations in developing countries to promote cultural exchanges and help expand the market for the genre, sources said Saturday.

The ministry will most probably provide the money for the project to the Japan Foundation, an independent administrative agency under the ministry's jurisdiction, which will purchase the broadcasting rights of the programs.

The sources said the ministry and the foundation were talking about purchasing several anime series of 30-minute episodes including one about soccer, because of the sport's popularity worldwide.

Anime has become extremely popular in Europe and North America over the past few years, and about 60 percent of cartoon shows aired in the world are produced in Japan.

This popularity, however, has yet to permeate developing countries, where the audiovisual market is not as well developed and broadcasters lack the money to import Japanese products.

The ministry started market research in Africa, Asia and the Middle East last year, asking its embassies to report what types of cartoons were popular, or if the countries have aired Japanese programs.

Headline: Smooth rush for bookstore employees
Author: Marianly Hernandez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Student Arlena Amaro taps her right foot and carries a stack of paperbacks while standing in line at the University Park bookstore. She can't tap her foot for long because the line is continuously moving.

As the 12th person in line, Amaro estimates that she'll make her way around the lane dividers in about five minutes.     

"You're always impatient when you're in line, but it's been moving fast," she said.  

To prepare for this semester's spring rush the management for the UP and Biscayne Bay Campus bookstores hired temporary staff, which will work from early December until about the second week of the Spring semester.  

"We tell them [how long they will work] right off the bat, just so we don't waste anybody's time," said Chris Quaintance, UP operations manager.  

According to Quaintance, the UP bookstore hired 150 temporary workers and had about 50 to 60 staff working at one time, including in the upstairs café.    

Even though both bookstores are highly staffed, they extended their regular hours during the first two weeks of class and the UP bookstore opened seven days a week.  

Christian Rodriguez, a UP bookstore employee, usually works 20 hours per week, and according to his estimates, worked about 30 to 40 hours per week during rush.  

Even though Rodriguez said it was the smoothest rush he's seen, he still sees room for improvement.  

"[The main issue is] restocking the books," said Rodriguez. "The shelves empty out and you constantly have to keep restocking."

Another reason the FIU bookstores had a smooth rush season was because students were able to buy their books sooner because of faculty book orders.  

"The earlier the faculty lets us know what books they're using, the better it is for us," said Scott Cohen, assistant manager of the BBC bookstore.  

Cohen said that when the bookstore knows what books it needs, the books are available sooner. 

Students can sell back books earlier and buy used books earlier too. Cohen also said that, the cashiers at BBC were more efficient this season.  

Manisha Suckoo has worked on and off at the BBC bookstore for more than four years. Suckoo and Cohen agree that there is one more factor in the smooth rush season.  

"I think that people were buying their books elsewhere," Cohen said.   "I was actually going to say that, but I didn't want to," Suckoo said. "Students are finding other options."  

Besides buying books online through the FIU bookstore, students have alternative textbook sources, such as other online purchasing sites, online trading sites and off-campus bookstores.

Amaro's initial reaction after entering the bookstore was to stall and hand over her bag to employees.  

"I almost left my backpack in the cubbyholes inside," Amaro said.

This is the first time either bookstore does not have a bag check-in to prevent textbook theft.  

Quaintance said that the new system is on a trial basis.  Barnes and Nobles College Bookstore, the owner of the FIU bookstores, will decide whether bag check-in will become permanently obsolete. This being dependent on sales.

Headline: Motorcycle accident claims student's life
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Joshua Bolivar Gomez, a sophomore who was majoring in criminal justice, passed away on the afternoon of December 11, 2004, after his motorcycle collided head-on with a car on West 20 Ave. He was 20 years old.

Gomez was traveling south bound on West 20 Ave. on his way back home to Sweetwater, after trying to acquire a license plate  in Hialeah for his motorcycle. A car traveling west on the same road made an illegal turn onto West 62 St. just as Gomez was crossing the intersection. 

The motorcycle hit the front of the car as the car made the turn, ejecting Gomez from his seat and sending him beneath the car and onto the sidewalk. Gomez died on impact. 

The police found the driver of the car to be at fault.

Gomez's parents did not allow him to buy the 2003 Suzuki motorcycle, but after he purchased the motorcycle with his credit card, there was no way the family could return it.

"He always wanted a bike and he really wanted to get that one," said senior Vanessa Gomez, Joshua's older sister.

The family became aware of the accident later that night after finding a detective's note on the door of their house.

"We couldn't believe it at first. It's just one of those things that no one expects and we all took it our own ways," Vanessa Gomez said.

Funeral services were held later that week at Bernardo Garcia's Funeral Home on Bird Road.

Joshua spent a year at Florida Atlantic University, where he played for their soccer team before transferring to FIU. Friends from both schools attended the wake.

"Everybody was there - everybody from church, all his soccer friends, their girlfriends, their friends; everybody sent cards and flowers. We're still getting cards," Vanessa Gomez said.

Gomez is remembered by his family for his hard work, like helping his father construct a new deck for their house and helping with the landscaping and other work around the house. He was known as a good friend who refused to do things he deemed bad.

"His friends used to say that, out of all of them, he was the best one. He never got involved with anything bad - he was like a nun," Vanessa Gomez said.

Though some time has passed since the day of the accident, she admits that Joshua's memory will always be with her.

"We're all trying to handle this the best way that we can, but you just can't ever erase him from our lives. He was a good boy. He was a good brother."

He is survived by his mother, father and another sister, Yamell.

Headline: It's no surprise 'Aviator' holds so many Oscar nominations
Author: Elena Santalo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Martin Scorsese's "The Aviator" landed in box offices around the world, to tell the tale of the grand aviator himself- Howard Hughes(Leonardo DiCaprio). This film marks Scorsese's sixth academy award nomination for best director. He is the front-runner in the category, because not only did he do an incredible job, but he gains sympathy for not having won any previous nominations.  The almost three-hour film skims across Hughes' life from the late 1920's until the 1940's. 

As a child, Hughes had dreams of "making the biggest movies, the fastest planes and being the richest man in the world." Although he grew up to be an obsessive compulsive, his eccentricity helped him realize these dreams. He made a few extravagant and expensive movies, but his true passion was for flight. He was constantly inventing new airplanes and testing them, regardless of the expense.	

"This is definitely DiCaprio's best film that I've seen," said freshman Alex Nuche.

DiCaprio's portrayal of this aviation pioneer is the most amazing part of the film. The role was extremely tough, yet DiCaprio comes shining. He does it all, from washing his hands to the point of bleeding and not wanting to touch the doorknob, to locking himself in a room and letting himself completely go, further developing Hughes' struggle to keep himself composed and out of his neurotic state. DiCaprio truly does an amazing job, showing the audience what Hughes accomplished and what his life was really like.  

DiCaprio also reveals Hughes' strength of character perfectly whenever he is faced with his biggest business competitor, Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), the famous owner of Pan American Airlines. The rivalry between Baldwin and DiCaprio's characters provides some of the most captivating scenes in the film. Although we are used to seeing Baldwin as a good guy in previous films, he captures Trippe's malevolence with a twinkle in his eye- even when Hughes triumphs and Trippe is left with nothing. 

Of course, what would the movie be without Hughes' famous leading ladies? Among them are the elegant Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and the ravishing Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). Blanchett is the perfect chatty, athletic Hepburn we all remember. The scenes between DiCaprio and Blanchett are the most fun and lovable. You get caught in their romance and in the absurd way she keeps him normal. 

Beckinsale's performance, although not as significant, is utterly adorable. With her swift and sexy air, she reveals Gardner's appeal to the audience, and brings a smile each time she calls Hughes, "Baby."

The film is very well made and also had some educational value. 

"I enjoyed the movie because I learned a lot of the cool things that Howard Hughes had done," said freshman Andrea Arteaga.

 I would definitely agree, because before the film, I saw Hughes as just another famous billionaire, but now I see his influence on the movie industry, especially with the evolution of the plane. 

All in all, the cast works extremely well together, and although the film took longer than I prefer, the cast and sets keep the entertainment alive. 

Whether you see it in the movie theater or rent it from Blockbuster when it is released on DVD, I highly recommend this movie as a must see.

Headline: DANCE!
Subheadline: A series of new classes at the biscayne bay campus will have students' feet moving in a variety of worldly styles - for free!
Author: Katherine Beale / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There's good news for dance lovers. The Student Programming Council is offering free dance classes at the Biscayne Bay Campus at the Wolfe University Center. Students can choose between belly dancing on Mondays, salsa on Tuesdays and ballroom dancing on Thursdays - or any combination of the three. All classes take place from 6-7p.m. in WUC 155 (sometimes 157), and all classes are open, so while faithful attendance is encouraged, suddenly deciding to start attending in the middle of the semester isn't a problem.  

Can't choose between the three, and don't have time to take them all? The Beacon attended the first class for each dance to give you an inside report on what you can expect. 

If you're trying to beat your cousins to be the favorite grandchild, or you're a guy looking for a way to impress women, or you just love classic dances, ballroom dancing is the class for you. Husband - wife team Richard and Karen Campbell demonstrate each technique slowly and clearly. They teach the man's and the woman's parts separately, then show how to combine them flawlessly.

Within the first 15 minutes, the Campbells will have you believing that you too can follow gracefully like Karen or lead naturally like Richard. The instructors hope to teach five or six dances over the course of the semester, which may include swing, foxtrot, waltz, mambo, cha-cha and merengue. The dances they teach depend on what students want to learn.  

"We want something that will get them out on the dance floor," said Karen. "The first year they had a group that wanted to learn tango, so they focused several classes on that dance."

According to Richard, ballroom dancing can make any man irresistible to women. 

"Guys," he said with a smile, "I don't care how ugly you are. If you can do this, they'll line up for you!"  

Now that ballroom dancing has made the list of recognized Olympic sports, those who start learning now may very well find themselves ahead of the next big social trend. But whether or not ballroom dancing becomes hip again, learning your way around a dance floor may help you to impress someone.  

Senior Peter Hanner explained his interest in the class. 

"My girlfriend told me I can't dance, and I said, 'No I can't,'" he said while shaking his head and laughing. 

Luckily, turning the rhythmically challenged into presentable dancers is the Campbell's specialty.  

"If [the students] don't get it," Richard said, "I blame the teacher." 

The Campbells believe that when students have the desire to learn, there are no bad students.

By far the most physical of the dance classes is belly dancing. It is a unique way to trim down your mid-section.  Instructor Amber Joy Rava will teach you to bend in ways that you never thought possible.  

According to Rava, although many believe belly dancing to be a woman's dance form, there are a lot of great male belly dancers as well. Over the course of the semester, she hopes to build on students progress to teach more advanced techniques, but of course, new students are always welcome.  

"I love helping people express themselves," Rava said. "[Belly dancing] is great for expression, finding inner beauty and feeling more confident."  

Students who gave the class a try seemed pleased by what they found.

"I saw the sign and noticed [the session] was on the same day of my class, so I came in," said Malenie Rivera, "It was fun, something new."

 For those who've been missing out on the salsa craze and want to dance with their friends, the Tuesday class shouldn't be missed.  While the University Park campus offers salsa classes through The Salsa Kings at $5 a lesson, BBC students can learn for free from Jim Chang, whose group, Tropical Flavor, has performed at the last two Latinos Unidos celebrations. Chang teaches each step by first walking the students through it several times, then setting it to music.  

As students learn more steps he adds them to the basic step and repeats them until everyone feels they've mastered the concept. He adds humor to basic principles, and students laugh their way through class.  

"In salsa the man has total, absolute control," Chang said. He let the men smile and the women raise their eyebrows for a moment before adding, 

"It's the only thing in life we have total control over. So ladies, please don't take it away from us!"  

This got a laugh out of everyone, and the dancers became more relaxed. "They become my friends, not just my students," Chang said.

First-time salsa participant Jennifer May, a class of 2003 alumna, said she felt "very fortunate" to be able to take the class, especially when she learned that that students at the other campus were paying for salsa lessons.  She says she was interested in the class because it can be embarrassing to be Spanish and not be able to dance salsa. "It's going to take some practicing, but I picked up faster than I thought," said May. Chang is confident of his students ability to succeed. "Anyone who has an interest in learning will at least accomplish enough to have a great time," Chang said.  

Senior Joel Ploanco is having a great time with salsa. "I love [salsa] because it's real passionate and a very sensual dance, and at the same time it's a lot of communication," he said.

For those searching for their next passion, or just looking for someone to be passionate about, the "Dancing with the Wolfe" series is a great opportunity.  As a belly dance participant nicely put it, "It's free, so why not try it out."
