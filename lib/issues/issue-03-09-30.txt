Bush can't be trusted



To the Editor: 



Upon reading Drew Mallo's distortion of the facts in the last issue of The Beacon, I admit that I needed a couple of minutes to compose myself. I was flabergasted at either Mallo's lack of political knowledge or capacity to tell lies. 

First off, Mallo claims that Democrats completely oppose any action against the terrorists of Sept. 11. This is false. A majority of Democrats oppose violating international law and invading Iraq without due cause. Not once has any American citizen, let alone a Democrat, claimed that al-Queda or Osama "Been-Forgotten" should not be hunted down.

I propose a question to you Drew: Did the United States have any logical reason to enter Iraq? The answer is no. Even your man, Dubya, admitted last week that America has "no evidence" linking Iraq to Sept. 11. Did you miss that bit of news? Where are the weapons of mass destruction? We have men and women our age out there dying on Iraqi soil for no reason. If you feel so strongly Mr. Mallo, by all means pick up a rifle and get yourself to Baghdad. Our troops need to come home, and hopefully France and the rest of the United Nations will accept Dubya's pleas for help. He realizes that he made a mistake going at this war by himself but he's too ignorant to admit this and improve his chance for international help. 

I would like to throw out the name of the man who will challenge and defeat Bush in 2004. General Wesley Clark. This is a man who fought and served in Vietnam. He was dodging bullets in Vietnamese jungles while Bush was dodging his last year of service in the national guard. Clark will soon demonstrate his capability to fight terrrorism against the actual terrorists. He will do what Bush has proven a failure in: capturing Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.

Finally, lets talk about domestic issues. Above all, Dubya inherited Clinton's massive budget surplus, the largest in America history mind you, and managed to turn it upside down into the largest deficit in history. I'm no math major but that tells me there is some major economic blundering going on. Add that to the fact that the total hourly employment has dropped from 111.6 million to 108.3 million, while the unemployment rate has risen from 4.2 percent to 6.1 percent. Let's not even get into Dubya's propensity to throw millions of badly needed tax dollars back at wealthy citizens and corporations.

Bush must be removed from office in 2004. He is a violator of international law, of human rights, and now he's dodging new allegations his White House leaked information exposing a covert CIA spy. He can no longer be trusted to run our country, as he has taken it from riches to rags. God Bless America and God help Dubya these next two years.

Headline: Audio / Visual: Outkast
Subheadline: Speakerboxxx/The Love Below: Two innovative visions of rap
Author: Claudia Ortega / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
You think you know what you're going to get when you're clutching your double album Outkast in the line at Best Buy, dying to get to the car, tear it open and listen.   

Andre 3000 and Big Boi's respective titles, The Love Below and Speakerboxxx, already hint at the idiosyncrasy at play on these CDs. 

But nothing can prepare you for The Love Below, most probably the first CD you put in. We were all expecting Dre's innovative vision to be at the forefront here, but he goes beyond anyone's expectations, singing, playing guitar, saxophone and keyboards, and just jamming Prince-style.

Speakerboxxx doesn't contain anything as groundbreaking, but it continues along the lines of Stankonia, sprinkling rap with fresh, funk-infused beats making a solid album.

Two of the singles are off of Speakerboxxx: "The Way You Move" and "Ghettomusick" (which includes Dre on lead vocals). 

Typical Outkast songs, they feature live instruments, hooks that are sung, and beats that are as easy to dance to as they are to blast in your car.

Big Boi gets deep in tracks like "Church" and "The Rooster," proving that there can be an art to rap, that it's not all about "bling-bling," "hoez" and tired beats. He weaves these heartfelt poems into fast-paced rhymes shaming all vapid, image-obsessed "rappers" out there.

The third single off this release is "Hey Ya!" which comes off of The Love Below. 

Fun, funky and upbeat, it's a reflection of all the rest of the tracks on the appropriately named The Love Below: Women, love and sex feature prominently on Dre's new effort, but his tongue-in-cheek approach and interludes keep the album from being all-out cheesy. If you think all rap is chauvinist, listen to the interlude "God," and then tell me Dre doesn't love women.

If there's any doubt as to where Big Boi and Andre 3000 stand now, take comfort in Big Boi's words in "Tomb of the Boom":  "People, stop the madness 'cause me and Dre be OK/Outkast, Cell Therapy, to cell division/We just split it down the middle so you can see both the visions." 

Through excellent production, that's exactly what you get: two very different but innovative visions.

Headline: Yoga offers strength for body and mind
Author: Marjorie Rizzo/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU students are learning how to release stress at Yoga and Tai-Chi classes, and without handing over any cash. In collaboration with the FIU Health Care and Wellness Center, the university is offering free Yoga and Tai-Chi lessons to students at both the University Park campus and the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Bonnie Quiceno, the Yoga instructor at BBC who has been teaching Yoga at FIU for three years, said that it is more than simply exercise.

"Yoga promotes stress reduction and body strengthening, as well as works your concentration," Quiceno said. 

Quiceno added that she gets feedback from her students all the time. 

"They are always telling me how they enjoy it and how they feel it is helpful for them to relieve stress, especially during exams," Quiceno said.

The type of Yoga that Quiceno teaches is called Hatha Yoga, which has been known to improve flexibility and muscle joint mobility, correct posture, strengthen the spine and, above all, relax the mind and body.

According to the ABC-OF-TRAVEL Network, yoga was practiced some 5,000 years ago at the beginning of human civilization, and it is the most diversified spiritual practice in the world, crossing over many cultures and religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Western culture. Still, even though Yoga is spiritual, it does not intend to conflict with any religion, because anyone can benefit from meditation, no matter what they believe in.

Experts say a number of bodily and mental benefits result from the practice of Yoga, some of which include an increase of body awareness, relief of chronic stress patterns in the body, refreshment of the body by relieving muscle strain, centering attention, sharpening concentration, and freeing the spirit.

Saudy Pena, a Yoga student at BBC, says that her experience with Yoga has been remarkable. 

"I think Yoga is an amazing thing to be involved in physically and mentally. One receives peace of mind and can physically see the benefits," Pena said.

Patricia Fitzpatrick, a teacher's assistant for the modern languages department and a yoga student at BBC as well, agrees with Pena.

"It helps you with stress outside of class and helps you calm down and focus, and it so convenient having it on campus," Fitzpatrick said.

But the Yoga classes are not alone in receiving praise. 

Tai-Chi has been becoming more popular and, like Yoga, its history traces far back, close to 400 B.C. 

Tai-Chi is said to offer a variety of benefits as well, including improved cognitive ability; decreased levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and muscular tension; improved circulation; and an overall sense of well-being. 

Tai-Chi involves a combination of martial arts and meditative exercises for the body which are similar to Yoga.

Laura Roberts, who attends the Tai-Chi classes instructed at UP by Robert Bacher, says that Tai-Chi is a great way to meditate and feel healthy. 

"Tai-Chi is an hour for me to blow off stress and give my body some attention too. I really recommend it, and it's free," Roberts said.

Both Yoga and Tai-Chi are free to FIU students with valid identification, and special discount offers are available to faculty members. The classes at BBC are hosted on the patio of the Wellness Center. Classes at UP are held in the first floor lounge of housing complex Panther Hall. For more information on the classes, students can contact the Health and Wellness Center at either campus.

Headline: New lawsuit threatens national 'do not call' list
Author: By Tony Pugh/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
WASHINGTON - Just hours after Congress voted to salvage a "do not call" list for those who don't want to be phoned by telemarketers, a U.S. district judge in Denver derailed the popular proposal once more, claiming it violates free speech rights.

In a suit filed by the American Teleservices Association and several telemarketing companies, U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham ruled that the Federal Trade Commission "entangled itself too much in the consumers' decision by manipulating consumer choice and favoring speech by charitable (organizations) over commercial speech."

Similar First Amendment concerns were raised, but not ruled on, in another suit in Oklahoma earlier this week.

The call ban exempts telemarketers who represent political organizations, charities, public opinion or market surveyors, or companies with which consumers have a "business relationship."

Earlier Thursday, legislation authorizing the "do not call" list whizzed through the House of Representatives 412-8 and Senate 95-0 and headed to President Bush's desk. The bill was introduced after U.S. District Judge Lee R. West ruled Wednesday in Oklahoma City that the FTC lacked the authority to create and implement the registry.

The speed and bipartisan cooperation belied the gridlock that typically stalls legislation for months and sometimes years, even when Democrats and Republicans agree in principle on issues.

Congressional leaders weren't shy in congratulating themselves for their lightning-like action. The measure was just introduced Wednesday evening.

"Congress has been called a slow and cumbersome beast, but I think you can see how fast this Congress is prepared to move when 50 million Americans are angry," said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who co-sponsored the House legislation.

Bush was expected to sign the measure, which makes it illegal for telemarketing firms to phone the more than 50 million phone numbers entered in the registry. The ban on calls is scheduled to begin next Wednesday. In spite of the political and legal maneuvering, the Direct Marketing Association, another telemarketing organization, is asking the industry not to call those who signed up for the registry.

"Whether or not there continues to be a government-administered national no-call list, it is appropriate for marketers to respect the wishes of consumers who have placed their phone numbers" on the list, said H. Robert Wientzen, president and CEO of the association.

Republican Sen. John Ensign of Nevada, a co-sponsor of the correcting legislation, said consumers were adamant about the issue.

"I think this is very important legislation just for the peace of mind of a lot of people back home. A lot of people that don't follow politics are talking about this issue," he said.

Telemarketers call millions of homes each day. Last year, they sold $654 billion in goods and services. The industry estimates that 2 million jobs could be lost if the registry begins.

People can register for the list at www.donotcall.gov or by calling (888) 382-1222 from phones they want blocked from telemarketers.

USPS to keep union representation

On Sept. 23, employees of the operational services, and administrative and clerical units of FIU's University Support Personnel System voted in favor of representation by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees AFL-CIO, Florida Council 79.

There were 475 ballots cast for the AFSCME union and 93 against it, reported the Public Employees Relations Commission, which oversaw the election. Two ballots were void. Sixty-three ballots were challenged. A total of 631 ballots were cast resulting in a 77 percent voter turnout.

"The majority of eligible voters came to vote and chose to have AFSCME as their representative.  We respect that decision and are committed to working with AFSCME," FIU President Modesto A. Maidique said in a university-wide e-mail sent on Sept. 24.

A new contract will now have to be negotiated between the AFSCME union and FIU's administrators, said Thomas H. Beasley, president of Local 3346 of the AFSCME union.

The Public Employees Relations Commission is a neutral adjudicative body, designated by the state to administer Florida's collective bargaining law and resolve public sector labor disputes.

Representing more than 110,000 public workers, AFSCME, Florida Council 79, is Florida's second-largest union. It has represented state university employees since the 1970s.

Panther Rage flag missing in action

Panther Rage is asking anyone with information on the whereabouts of its flag, which Panther Rage President Shaun Alcindor says was stolen at the Sept. 20 football game, to come forward. Alcindor said there will be no consequences for the parties involved; the organization simply wants its flag returned.

The flag was last seen at approximately 7 p.m. at the alumni table near the VIP entrance to the skybox of the FIU Community Stadium, according to Alcindor. Anyone with information about the missing flag should contact Panther Rage at 305-348-1906, rage@fiu.edu, or at the Campus Life office, GC 357.

Southern Methodist University halts race-based bake sale

A conservative student group, the Young Conservatives of Texas chapter, stirred controversy at Southern Methodist University with its affirmative action bake sale Sept.23. 

The group posted a sign saying white males had to pay $1 for a cookie, white women: 75 cents, Hispanics: 50 cents, blacks: a quarter. They held the sale to demonstrate the injustice of the use of race or gender as a factor in college admissions. Other conservative groups have held similar sales in recent months.

One black student filed a discrimination complaint with SMU because he said the bake sale was offensive. SMU officials shut down the bake sale after 45 minutes because they said it created a potentially unsafe situation for students.

"This was not an issue about free speech," said Tim Moore, director of the Hughes-Trigg Student Center at SMU. "It was really an issue where we had a hostile environment being created that was potentially volatile."

Headline: College of Engineering to build solar-powered home for 2005 Solar Decathlon
Author: Alejandra Diaz /  Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Recently chosen to participate in the 2005 Solar Decathlon, the College of Engineering will compete against students from across the country to build a 500-square foot, solar-powered house.  

FIU was notified that it had won the opportunity to be a part of the event after submitting a lengthy proposal detailing its plans to the U.S. Department of Energy, the event's main sponsor, in the spring.

"[The department] looked at schools with reputable faculty, students and resources, all of which we have," said student team leader and head architecture student for the project, Josh Freese. "We have the organization, motivation and commitment needed to win."

Judged on innovation, creativity and design, FIU students will have to create elaborate energy systems as well as make the house as livable as possible. Featuring one bedroom, one bathroom, a kitchen and an office area, the house must also be able to create enough power to energize an electric car throughout the duration of the event.   

The bathroom will not contain a working toilet due to the event's restrictions on sewage and wastewater use.  But the rest of the house must be fully equipped with refrigeration, communication outlets, hot water, lighting and even be able to run a home business.

During the event, approximately six people including one observer will continually "live" in the house, doing everything from preparing food to creating a web site and conducting live tours of the house for the visiting public. 

Working together to run the house efficiently and drive the electric car around the "Solar Village," at the event's site at the National Mall in Washington D.C., will keep the team busy but focused.

"We are not totally sure about how we will divide the housework, but we will probably make shifts so that everybody has a chance to do something," the team's post-student and School of Architecture representative Jordan Trachtenberg said. "It is too early to tell how we will do it, but those details will be worked out."

Competing for the coveted Solar Decathlon trophy and other prizes, the students will push to compete in 10 contests, which will test their architectural, engineering, marketing, and communications skills. 

"It is a matter of coordination, planning and energy, our students met during the summer and this is something other schools usually don't do until the fall," Assistant Dean of the School of Architecture Nathaniel Belcher said. "There is a strong contention of schools, but we look very good."

An energy point system will help judges decide on the design, build and operation of the house and will enable them to determine how efficiently and effectively the house is able to use solar-powered energy.

Because the house will be built at the College of Engineering and moved via semi-truck to the National Mall, the team will have to deconstruct, transport, rebuild and prepare the house in time for the event.

"They are going to give us about seven days after we arrive in D.C. to rebuild the house and make it fully functional," Trachtenberg said.

With help from the School of Architecture, the School of Journalism and Mass and Communication, and the International Hurricane Research Center, team members will combine their efforts to create, promote and gain sponsors to help them successfully complete the project.   

The electric car provided by the event will also give the team a chance to promote FIU and transport senators and other guests who will visit the village during the 21-day event.

Students will get the opportunity to work together and gain hands-on experience through real-world applications that they would normally not be able to learn in the classroom or out in the commercial field. 

"The ability to work with the other disciplines is important and will also help make all of us become more energy conscience," Freese said. "This event will allow us to show that this type of technology can be developed and used in the practical realm." 

Nationally sponsored by DOE and its Natural Renewable Energy Laboratory with private sponsors from BP Solar, The Home Depot and the American Institute of Architects, students will have to find funding from local sponsors in order to proceed with the event. 

Although team members are given $5,000 from the DOE they are concerned about their need for sponsors.  The total cost of the house is estimated at $300,000. But, the faculty is confident that the team's determination will help them gain all of the funding they need.

"The only challenge will be raising funds, but I have confidence that we have what it takes as long as students stay motivated and focused on their goal," Strange said. "Communication is going to help us succeed and we will do what it takes to create momentum."

In order to begin raising funds and gaining sponsors, the team has put together a marketing strategy that they will soon begin presenting with the help of their funding committee.

A one-credit Solar Decathlon class has also been set up by the College of Engineering in order to help students plan, research, design and build the solar house in preparation for the event. Each semester, the class will keep students working and developing different aspects of the house. 

During this semester, the class will focus on research and planning, but the actual building of the house is scheduled to start during the summer of 2004. While different stages the project are due at different times during the two year span of the event, team members plan to have each section fully completed three months prior to deadline.

"We hope to have things three months in advance to have time to run at least two tests of all the systems. This will help us make arrangements before we transport the house to D.C.," Freese said.

The Solar Decathlon, first held in 2002, was started to prove that investment in renewable energy technologies can reduce dependence on foreign oil and conserve natural resources, according to a Solar Decathlon information booklet.

"This project has some redeeming social value and we want to be part of the change in perception about solar energy use," said Strange.

Headline: Despite stereotypes, we are all different
Author: Yasmine Abellard/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
"Did you come here on a boat or an airplane?" I was once asked by a fifth grader. 

It was the early '90s, I had only been in the United States for four years, and Haitian refugees - or the "boat people," as they are so eloquently called - had begun making waves in the American media as they arrived to the not-so-welcoming shores of South Florida. 

From then on, it seemed that I was often associated with media images of poor and wandering refugees (amongst other things) when I mentioned where I was from. While I see nothing wrong with being poor and a refugee, there is something wrong with prejudging an individual based on one's generalized perception of an entire race of peoples - a.k.a. stereotyping. 

Having been in this country for a little over a decade, my mind was often bombarded with ethnic, as well as racial stereotypes I acquired from a variety of sources including movies, television, and even textbooks. 

It was common to hear anything from "Jews are cheap," and "Jamaicans are potheads," to "Whites have no rhythm," in everyday conversation. 

Qiana Swilley, a junior and chemistry major, considers herself to be of African American and Native American descent. Swilley is well acquainted with common stereotypes associated with her ethnic backgrounds: "Black people are ghetto, loud, ignorant, they're stupid, promiscuous...there are so many out there." 

As for being a Native American, Swilley says, "a lot of people think that Native Americans live in little groups, [in] teepees, and we go 'woo woo woo' all the time - it doesn't work that way." 

Swilley agrees that the media is responsible for generating these stereotypes, and believes that the manner in which her ethnic groups are depicted in movies and television sitcoms are intentional.

While some may consider stereotypes to be harmless, they can actually lead to assumptions about people you may meet or have never met. They can also affect an individual's daily life in significant ways from getting a job, to making friends, to who you date, to acts of violence. 

Christopher Bocaobos, President of the Asian Student Union, described several stereotypes often thought of Asians: "You have to be smart, people assume you know some kind of martial arts, something with computers, [and] they usually assume from the beginning that you can't speak English." 

The 21-year-old Philippino native adds, "Even though you're Asian, they always assume you're Chinese. It's never anything else. Asia's huge: India' s a part of Asia, China, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Philippines - it's not just China." 

Like Swilley, Bocaobos also believes the media is a strong influence in how various ethnic groups are viewed as a whole, but adds that ignorance also plays a role in stereotyping. 

While people do stereotype their own ethnic group, and fulfill the stereotypes outlined for them by society, it is quite irrational to believe that it is possible to determine all facets of a person's personality based merely on common representations of their ethnicity, or even the degree of melanin attributed to them. 

We live in an obsessive, ethnic-labeling society making it rather facile to generalize others based on what we assume to be true of an entire group, easing the path for prejudice and discrimination. Nevertheless, one should attempt to keep in mind that an individual is simply an individual, capable of accomplishing and failing like any other human being, regardless of their ethnic composition.  It is now 2003, and I still receive either a surprised or pitying look, or even comments such as, "You don't look Haitian," and my favorite "Your people are such hard workers," when I reveal my origin.  

I suppose I should set the record straight in response to these stereotypical statements: First, Haitians do not have a particular "look" - we resemble any other person from Europe to Asia; second, hard work is a matter of character, not culture; and as for how I entered this country - the same way the Irish, Italians, Chinese, and Cubans before me came -  via a passenger vehicle, with a ticket of determination, and a suitcase full of aspirations.

Headline: Dear Sen. Clinton: You need to be President
Author: John Colagrande, Jr./ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Dear Sen. Clinton,

I'm a registered New York Democrat who is attending graduate school at FIU in Miami. 

I am a staff writer for our school newspaper, The Beacon. I'm writing because I wish to encourage you to run for office of President of the United States. 

As a registered New York voter, I do not feel you will be neglecting your duties to the state of New York. They called you a carpetbagger when you ran for a Senate seat, and they'll call you a deserter if you run for president, but none of it will stick. You're Teflon, Mrs. C. 

You represent the best chance for the Democratic Party to take back the White House. You can get our country back on the right path. 

It is a paramount concern for citizens of the United States that President Bush does not win re-election. One would be hard pressed to name one constructive thing this administration has done since it came into office (illegitimately) in 2000. Someone name one thing. Name one good thing this administration had done. Come on. We're listening. 

Cricket, cricket... 

This administration is vulnerable, Mrs. C. They appear to get more so as time continues. The latest poll has Bush at 49 percent.

Look at the damage the Bush administration has done in three years. We've been at war - why exactly? We've got a huge debt, the rich got tax cuts, and the world hates us. We had the world in the palm of our hand after Sept. 11. Not anymore.

Mrs. C, I implore, if re-elected, the damage the Bush administration will do to our great country in eight years will take 16 years to undo. It's crystal clear. 

Please, Sen. Clinton. Please give further consideration to running for President. It's not too late. There's still four months before the first primary. You have plenty of time to raise money. What are you waiting for? What if another Democrat runs and wins in 2004, like Dean, Clark, or Kerry, then you may have to wait until 2012 to run. Think about that. 

Our country is ready for its first female president now and you will serve well. For my part, I plan to volunteer as much time as possible to the Democratic Party in Broward and Dade counties. 

Personally, I'd like to work on increasing voter registration in impoverished areas of Central and Northern Florida. We'll get more poor people to the polls. Then we'll see if the Republicans will win. And everyone knows how important Florida is.

I'm willing to sacrifice whatever it takes for this cause. It is time to act. I don't think I'm alone. 

Thank you very much, Mrs. C, and I hope you consider the call I'm sure you're receiving.

Headline: Liberal attitude leads to weak America, Bush justified in war
Author: Drew Mallo/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The position of the liberals on Iraq as it relates to the War on Terror and the War on Terror itself is very easy to understand. If you have been watching television you will notice that the position of Chapiqua Ted is to totally ignore Sept. 11, 2001. 

According to both Teds (Turner and Kennedy) the citizens of this country died in vain. Their position is to wait until we are attacked on our soil - to wait for thousands of Americans to die first before we act to the gathering dangers - this country would have inevitably faced until a very courageous President stepped up and lead a great coalition against the terrorists. 

Kennedy's Press secretary echoed what Kennedy and the rest of the liberal henchmen in this country and the socialist brothers and sisters of these liberals are saying: We have to appease the terrorists. 

Does anyone not understand why we cannot negotiate with terrorists? It wasn't just a slogan from President Reagan - it is an elucidation of the reality of terrorists. 

By definition terrorists do not utilize reasoning or logic. It is just like liberalism. Both liberals and terrorists utilize emotions and that is how they define their actions. I'm not saying that terrorists and liberals are the same, I am just bringing to fruition the reality of why it is impossible to deal with terrorists in any other way than to eliminate them.

Some liberals say that the war on Afghanistan is justified only because we waited for the terrorists to attack us. The liberal policy is to wait for thousands of Americans to die first before anything is done. 

And these nine dwarfs believe that Americans will elect them to lead our nation? Come on! Clinton did nothing but talk when American citizens were killed outside the United States - when our embassies were bombed in Africa - when Americans died on the USS Cole. If Bush was President during this time, the likelihood of a Sept. 11 would be much slimmer. 

The reason why the terrorists attacked us on Sept. 11 is because of the liberal attitude in this country - and the weak foreign policy of the former administration. 

When the attacks on Americans abroad were answered with words instead of action, the terrorists learned that America isn't serious about defending itself. That it will do essentially nothing at all if we or our interests are being threatened. 

Such is the attitude of the United Nations. The liberals want America to bow to an inept league of nations - a United Nations with a Clinton/liberal attitude on terrorism: do nothing, say an earful. The United Nations had tough words to deal with Iraq, but no ammo. 

One resolution should have been sufficient: the cease-fire agreement. Once Iraq broke the agreement to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction and have on-going inspections to validate the elimination of the WMD, we should have resumed conflict in Iraq. 

Instead we allowed an inept Secretary of State to go to the United Nations to negotiate with this league of nations to follow their own resolutions. How many resolutions does it take to get the United Nations to do something? 

And isn't it interesting that we have to ask permission from France, Germany, and Russia, nations who have oil agreements with the dictator, to defend America and democracy itself? 

Isn't it funny that we invested blood, sweat, and tears to rebuild France and Germany after World War II - a totally selfless act by America and American taxpayers - to ensure that France and Germany are free? Our sovereignty is determined by countries like Libya and China who hate America and everything it stands for? 

If any of these nine dwarfs and the crazy general really want to replace President Bush they should all denounce the United Nations and the terrorist appeasers. 

They should all thank President Bush for his leadership and offer a stronger way to deal with the terrorists. They should offer their own plan to deal with terrorism here and abroad. They should offer their own plan to deal with Iraq. 

I have one question: Where is the Democratic plan to make America safe? Answer: It is absent. Electing a Democrat to deal with national security is like empowering the environmentalist wackos to deal with an energy crisis. President Bush is the right President at the right time. Our economy is improving and terrorism is finally seriously being dealt with. 

I will be casting my unchadded vote for President Bush - a man who understands this nation and how to defend it. God bless President Bush and God bless America.

FIU football thanks you



To the Editor: 



On behalf of the FIU Department of Athletics and the football program, we would like to extend our appreciation and gratitude to the FIU student body and the various student organizations for your enthusiastic support during the Bethune Cookman game on Saturday.

It was truly a wonderful, memorable evening. What made the evening so special was that so many students turned out and had such a wonderful time. There is nothing that contributes to the atmosphere of the event like our students. The atmosphere on Saturday was electric and the comments we have received from people inside and outside the University has been how enthusiastic our students were. It was truly a major college atmosphere in every way and you are to be congratulated for making it happen.

We would also like to thank the many faculty and staff who support the program and who were in attendance on Saturday. As the  program continues to mature, we will continue to work to field a football program that we can all be proud to support and that you can enjoy during your four years at FIU; and after as a proud alumnus.

Again, thank you for your support and enthusiasm.



Don Strock,

Head Football Coach

Headline: Editorial: District Court ruling against 'do-not-call' list justified
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham, at least temporarily, struck down the Federal Trade Commission's national "do-not-call" list, on the grounds that the controversial list is unconstitutional. It's hard to argue with the ruling.

Earlier in the week, a separate judge, District Judge Lee R. West, ruled that the FTC did not have the authority to create such a list.  

Responding to that ruling with an absurd efficacy and efficiency not seen since members of congress acted to change the name of "French fries" to "freedom fries" in the congressional cafeteria, congress voted to grant the FTC the authority to create the list.

It looked like the bill was going to the oval office to await the president's signature until the aforementioned ruling stopped it again.

Direct marketers have argued that the list is unconstitutional.  They contend that calling someone's phone number is analogous to walking up to someone's porch and ringing the doorbell, and that the list, logically, might as well make it illegal to ring a doorbell. 

But perhaps the list's biggest problem is its crucial lack of consistency.

While it prevents commercial telemarketers from calling citizens on the "do-not-call" list, it does allow not-for-profit organizations, politicians, and pollsters to telemarket.  In other words it allows some to call, but not others.  There's a word for that: discrimination.

Doorbell argument aside, the bottom line is this: If the point of the list is to prevent unwanted calls from disturbing private citizens, then it must apply to either all organizations or else none at all, regardless of the intent of that organization. It cannot single out only some organizations.

Harassing phone calls have long been illegal, but the enforcement of such laws has never drawn a high priority.  A telemarketer, if warned by a household, cannot call that household again, and if the enforcement of those existing laws had any teeth, then this list wouldn't be necessary as a Band-Aid quick fix.

Headline: Convocation honors outstanding faculty
Author: Yudy Pineiro/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This week, students and faculty members have an excuse to give back to the FIU community by celebrating those professors recognized for their achievements in research, teaching, scholarship and service.

Faculty Convocation Week takes the stage Sept. 29 with events leading up to the Faculty Convocation on Oct. 3.

"It's a great opportunity to tell the faculty 'Hey, You did a really great job. Congratulations! We're proud of you,'" said Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of Academic Affairs. 

Added James Sutton, Convocation Committee chair and an English Department professor: "It's an opportunity for us to think about what we've done in the past and want to achieve in the future of this university."

The week's events are financed through the Provost Office's budget.

 The kickoff event was held Sept. 29 at FIU President Modesto A. Maidique's house on the University Park campus, acknowledging the achievements of the newly tenured and promoted faculty members.  

Until they reach the end of a tenure track that can take as long as six years, professors are hired on a trial basis, at the end of which they must present a case before the university. Professors are then evaluated based on their teaching, scholarship, research and service. If that case is won, they are granted lifelong job security and academic freedom, Sutton said.

On Sept. 30, BBC is honored with the presence of Florida Atlantic University President Frank Brogan at the Wolfe University Center Ballroom. Brogan's speech is titled "Towards the Privatization of Higher Education in Florida." 

"We think it's a great opportunity to introduce [Brogan] to our institution and the Biscayne Bay Campus as he discusses trends in higher education with a focus on privatization," said Rosenberg. 

Other events include a free Folk concert on Oct. 1 at 8 p.m. in the Graham Center's East Ballroom and the provost's dinner intended to honor the faculty senate on Oct. 2 where about 100 faculty members and administrators will be present. The dinner is  the only event that is by invitation only. 

"Any student and faculty are welcome at these events," said Sutton.

Culminating the week's events is the Faculty Convocation on Oct. 3 at 9 a.m. in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center at UP, where Maidique and Rosenberg will award about 28 faculty members with a medallion, plaque and $3,000 each for either their excellence in research, teaching, service, or advising. 

This year's convocation will also mark the first in an award for excellence in librarianship.

Sutton said he expects about 400 faculty members and 200 students will be present at the convocation, which is open to all.

An Honorary Degree and Awards Committee of 16 faculty and staff members choose the award recipients after a long and grueling application process in which about 50 applications are submitted. 

The award recipients are notified beforehand and there is no set limit for the amount of awards one member can receive, although usually they do not apply for the same one until a couple of years later.

"[Committee Chairman] Dr. Lewis Davidson and his committee are very dedicated and they spend a lot of time and effort in choosing the winning candidates from among a pool of candidates who have applied for the award," said Marcel Escoffier, chairman of the Faculty Senate.

Another special award, the Outstanding Faculty Award, is presented and sponsored by the Council of 100, which is a group made up of professional, business and civic leaders in the community with specific goals designed to help out the university. 

The recipient of the Outstanding Faculty Award receives a $10,000 scholarship. 

The name of the award recipient is not announced until the convocation.

"The council feels very strongly that faculty definitely needs an incentive for the work that they do," Heide K. Dans, coordinator of donor relations for the FIU Council of 100.

Besides the awards presentations, there will also be a speech given by University of Miami President Donna E. Shalala at the faculty convocation. Shalala's speech is entitled, "Private and Public Higher Education:Converging or Diverging?"

Finishing off the week is a luncheon, which will mark the end of this year's Faculty Convocation Week and the commencement of planning for next year's event honoring the next 30 or so faculty members.

"We have many accomplished faculty. In fact, far more than can be recognized at one event," said Rosenberg.

Headline: New TV series have a strategy: use an old hit tune
Author: Stephen Battaglio / New York Daily News
&nbsp;
The shows are new, but their theme songs sure aren't.

Many of the new TV series on the schedule this fall will be using hit music to get viewers to tune in. ABC's "Karen Sisco" starts off with the Isley Brothers' "It's Your Thing." NBC's "Las Vegas" opens with "A Little Less Conversation" from Elvis Presley. CBS' "Joan of Arcadia" kicks in with "One of Us" by Joan Osborne. ABC's "I'm With Her" uses a Sugar Ray version of the Joe Jackson rock staple "Is She Really Going Out With Him?"

It's a trend that began to gain momentum in recent years, when pulsating music from The Who played over the opening credits of two top crime shows - "CSI" ("Who Are You?") and "CSI: Miami" ("Won't Get Fooled Again").

Why use hit songs on TV shows? Producers say the struggle for a new series to break through the prime-time clutter is so tough these days, they need all the help they can get. 

Having a song that viewers know can lure them in.

"You have 20 seconds to grab people," said Chris Henchy, executive producer of "I'm With Her." "If it's something people are aware of and it's popular, maybe they will give it a second look."

Executive producer John Landgraf wanted "It's Your Thing" for "Karen Sisco" because the '60s soul sound is already associated with two films based on Elmore Leonard novels, "Get Shorty" and "Out of Sight" (which also featured the Sisco character).

But "It's Your Thing" also captures the essence of the independent, butt-kicking federal marshal played by Carla Gugino. "It's really a funky hymn of female empowerment," says Landgraf.

The same goes for the use of Osborne's "One of Us" in "Joan of Arcadia," about a teenage girl (Amber Tamblyn) who hears God speak to her through everyday people she meets.

The show's creator, Barbara Hall, said the song's familiar hook ("What if God was one of us") "makes you feel like the show has always been there."

Hall got Osborne to record a condensed version of the song so that the lyrics would match up with the opening credits. 

Presley wasn't available to recut "A Little Less Conversation" for "Las Vegas." 

But the remix of the 1968 track - which became an international hit this past year after being used in a Nike commercial - was just right for how the producers envisioned their show.

"It speaks to the Vegas of today in 2003, and yet it's a throwback to the Vegas of old," said "Las Vegas" creator Gary Scott Thompson. 

There will still be plenty of original TV themes this year. Missy Elliott performs a song for Eve's UPN sitcom, and Macy Gray sings a new composition for NBC's "Miss Match," for example.

But if the trend of using established hits continues, the songs that rise from TV themes to permanent parts of the pop-culture landscape could become extinct.

"There are so many iconic television songs, like `The Twilight Zone,'" said David Bushman, curator of the Museum of Television and Radio. "It would be a shame to lose that art."

Headline: Simpson made to play part of dumb blonde
Author: Robert Gramatges / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Why does everyone make so much fun of Jessica Simpson? I would love to hang out with her for an afternoon. She looks like a hoot! 

Quite frankly, I have taken personal offense at people who use her brain farts against her. I say about a million stupid (I mean stupid) things every few months. I sure would hate it if MTV cut out every intelligent statement I make, and instead paste all the stupidities that come out of my mouth into a 22-minute show. 

I think it's comically lazy of the media to use Jessica's random comments as jokes. Everything she says is posted in magazines to make her look brain-dead. This makes no sense to me. 

There is nothing witty about repeating what she says to humiliate her and get laughs. In Touch magazine and pompous Bill Maher's "Real Time" need to up their game and be a little more creative when they make fun of people. 

If I hear someone say "Chicken of the Sea" in a condescending manner one more time, I think I am going to explode. Repeating the stupid things people say is very grade school and more importantly, annoying

Interestingly enough, the show is called "Newlyweds" and yet no one seems to mention the relationship portrayed by the show, which is fascinating. 

I love the fact that they are showing that it's ok to not live with each other before marriage. These couples make it seem fun to discover what its like after they take the vows. Since they also display a lot of affection, patience and concern, it's quite refreshing to see marriage portrayed in a nice light for once (and especially on MTV.) Sure, the editing makes it seem like the couple is constantly bickering, but I doubt it is as frequent as it seems. Furthermore, Nick and Jess' little tiffs don't interest me.  

The reality of reality television is that viewers don't care to see others happy. Sadistic audiences much prefer to see the people on television get in fights and make asses of themselves. MTV knows this. This is their expert formula for "shows" like "Made" (fat dorks gone wild) and "Dismissed" (yikes.)

I am not at all above "Newlyweds." Nick and Jessica are fun to watch. I feel much more secure laughing with them than laughing at them. I don't have to be patronizing when I talk about them to look sophisticated. 

People talk about the show like their own poos don't stink. I have no qualms with the reality that I can be dim-witted from time to time. "Newlyweds" is good, clean fun. I would like to commend Jessica for two more things before I retire. 

One: It's great to see a decent woman in a shawl. Two: It's even better to see a celebrity look amazing without a bucket of makeup on.

Headline: PDOSSAs abound, but still not accepted
Author: Heather Brummer / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Back in 1991, while many of us were still cruising around elementary school oblivious to media hype, NBC's evening drama, "LA Law" was making headlines. But contrary to what you may be thinking, the buzz that year had nothing to do with great acting or even lousy acting. No, what topped the news was the word that two of the show's main characters, C.J. and Abby, had shared a lesbian kiss, the first ever on national television. 

It is uncertain as to why the networks allowed the episode to air; the early 1990s weren't particularly known for its acceptance of an alternate lifestyle. Yet whatever the reason was, this show paved the way for many to come.

Since that point, "Roseanne," "Picket Fences," "Will & Grace," "Dawson's Creek" and other TV shows have continued with their PDOSSAs (Public Displays of Same-Sex Affection) ever since. Some have had great success with the technique, some experienced a backlash, and others had to fight to just get their episode on the air.   

It seems that some of us want to be in the dark when it comes to homosexuality on television: Less is good, none is better.  If you have any doubts, just do a little research on the number of publications that came under heat for simply posting the picture of the kiss shared between Madonna and Britney Spears at the MTV Music Awards. Almost all were criticized and some even had to retract the photos and issue apologies. One might wonder if any publication has ever had to apologize for posting a racy kissing picture between, say, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. It seems doubtful.     

So you may be asking yourself why television shows continue to air episodes producers know will cause trouble. Why skate on thin ice? Because it pushes the ratings through the roof, that's why. Homosexuality on television is still looked at as taboo and if there's one thing people love, it's taboo.  Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Winona Ryder locked lips on, "Friends" a few years back?  

Any type of same-sex smooching gets people going. The possibilities are truly endless, though, and I don't just mean on television. 

A co-worker of mine recently shared a story from her day in which she described a rather rude phone call she received from a customer. My inclination is that she meant to explain how the woman had been "chewing her out," but a slip of the tongue resulted in her replacing "chewing" with "eating." What ensued was nothing short of embarrassing: three red faces (hers, mine and some poor customer standing in front of us) and no graceful way out. Admittedly, this would have probably held the same degree of shame even if the person she was speaking of had been a man, but I'm certain the mental image our customer formed has lived in her mind since that moment.

Is there an easy solution to all of this, one way we can just please everyone at once? It doesn't look likely. After all, it has been 12 years since the first same-sex kiss aired on national television and people haven't stopped staring in amazement. 

Like all things, the time may come when the public isn't taken aback or writing an angry letter to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution demanding an apology for having the audacity to print a picture of two women kissing. 

It could be awhile until the protests stop. Yet as long as the ratings jump, the networks will continue to bring us everything our mothers never wanted us to see. No matter what is said, people will always have the impulse to watch human sexuality on display. If you air it, they will come.

Headline: Badu battles writer's block throughout tour
Author: Thor Christensen / The Dallas Morning News
&nbsp;
Like some latter-day Jack Kerouac, Erykah Badu went on the road looking for inspiration and found it bubbling in a stream of consciousness. In Badu's case, she wasn't hitchhiking but cruising in a 40-foot tour bus packed with recording gear.

The result, Worldwide Underground, is one of the year's most free-form R&B albums, with several mind-bending songs that twist and turn past the nine-minute mark.

"My idea was to do an EP with just five songs, but then I got carried away," says the Dallas singer. "I decided to shape it, write some more and spray perfume on it and put another feather in it."

Badu's latest creation began last year with a massive case of writer's block. Stymied by a lack of new songs, she set up a makeshift recording studio in the cabin of her tour bus and hit the road on what she dubbed "The Frustrated Artist Tour."

Between concerts, she holed up in the bus and knocked out drafts of tunes that wound up on "Worldwide." A new version of her Grammy-winning hit "Love of My Life" sprang to life when Queen Latifah and the rapper Bahamadia walked on board and began singing "Funk You Up" by the late `70s female trio Sequence.

Other songs took flight only after Badu stepped off the bus. In Miami, she ventured into a studio to record "Back in the Day" and stumbled across Lenny Kravitz, who gave the song its jazz-funk guitar groove.

In Italy, giddy concertgoers helped her write "Woo."

"I ran out of breath onstage and I just said `Woo!' and (the audience) started repeating it," she says. "They didn't understand what I was saying, so they started repeating the one thing they did understand, and we just kept going with it."

If "Woo" represents the light side of "Worldwide Underground," then the heavy side is "Danger," a foreboding tune filled with sirens, gun blasts and a phone call from prison. Picking up on a story that began on 1997's "Otherside of the Game," the new song deals with a girlfriend coping with the fact that her man has gone to jail. For Badu, the subject hits home.

"It's my life, it's where I'm from. These are things that happened in my neighborhood," says the singer, whose absentee father spent time behind bars. It's a problem "that doesn't stop. It keeps recycling itself into something bigger and bigger and easier to ignore, so I thought it was a good idea to remind us."

"I love psychedelic music," she says. "Every single album I do is inspired by Pink Floyd's `Dark Side of the Moon' - not only the music, but the sequence of that album, the musicianship, the haunting sound of it."

Her songs received tons of airplay in the past, but radio has been slow to embrace "Danger," and the singer isn't expecting Worldwide Underground to shatter any sales records.

"The general population won't get it right away, but I think the underground will really appreciate the artistry of the album," she says. "I decided to go with the longer songs because they're good songs, not because they fit into any radio time slots ... I have no desire to be `Billboard No. 1, 2 or 3.' It's super if it happens, but I don't want to sell music."

Subheadline: "Under the Tuscan Sun": Makes you want to buy a 300-year-old villa
Author: Michelle Roberts / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Mama mia!  Sometimes it takes losing everything you've ever had to find everything you've ever wanted.

Based on the memoir by Frances Mayes, "Under the Tuscan Sun" tells the story of a recently divorced writer who regains faith in love and destiny. While the plot may sound cliché, it is presented in a very fresh and well-acted way.  

After her marriage falls apart, Frances (Diane Lane) finds herself at a crossroads and decides a change of scenery would be best.  

With some luck and a few impulsive decisions, Frances stumbles upon and buys an old villa in a Tuscan village.  The 300-year-old villa, like Frances, is a work in progress.  

It is during its renovation that Frances begins to discover herself and the country around her.  

 Lane successfully shows her acting range, as she possesses enough charm, vulnerability and sincerity to accurately portray the down-on-her-luck divorcee.  

The film's colorful supporting characters, particularly Frances' best friend Patti played by Sandra Oh, provide witty comic relief.  Most of the funny moments ensue when Frances encounters and fumbles with the new culture, language and people.  The humor in the film is light and original, and will probably be well received by an audience that includes all age groups.  

Shots of the Tuscan countryside and Italian shores make even sunny Miami Beach look, well, drab.  The scenic locations are eye candy and will definitely cause some "oohs" and "ahhs."  Watching the movie is almost like taking a two-hour vacation.

And though the film lasts about two hours, it is every bit enjoyable...kind of like a multi-course Italian meal - long and delicious!  You'll get lost in a movie about people, second chances, love and life's little joys like picking olives and drinking wine in the Tuscan country. The scenes, as well as storyline and acting, flow easily throughout the movie and never lack vitality.    

"Under the Tuscan Sun" will leave everyone walking out of the theater uplifted and feeling as if anything is possible, even buying a 300- year-old villa in Tuscany.

Headline: Audio / Visual : "The Rundown"
Subheadline: "The Rundown": Removes any doubts of The Rock's abilities
Author: Jay Santiago / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you had any doubt that "The Rock" would make it in Hollywood, The Rundown will change your mind.  

Although the plot is not the greatest in the world, his natural charisma and onscreen presence carries the movie, creating an enjoyable and funny hour- -and-a-half.  

Without him, the movie would have been simply another horrible Dickie Roberts-type flop. The Rundown solidifies the former wrestler/ UM football player as the future of action heroes, replacing the aging Sylvester Stalone, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenger.

The movie itself is pretty basic.  The Rock plays Beck, a bounty hunter hired by a mob boss to go to the jungles in the Amazon to find and return the boss' son Travis, a wise-cracking jokester played by Sean William Scott.  

The movie takes off with Rock giving all of his counterpart's three options: A) Beck's way, B) Beck's way with force, and C) there is no C.  

Of course the answer always ends up being B.  

In the meantime, The Rock battles football players, jungle natives and even Christopher Walken, who couldn't be more senile if he was staying at Century Village.  

If anyone needs proof that drugs do major damage, look no further than Walken. 

As I began to mention earlier, The Rock's charm is incredible, in the scheme of things he created an ideal atmosphere out of what would be mediocrity.  The movie actually shows a human side that we haven't seen in him before.  Aside from poking fun at himself, he dreams of settling down and owning a restaurant, and even allows a monkey to hump him repeatedly.  

The next step is a love story with J-Ho, and Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise will have some competition as top dogs in the business.   

The Rock said that he did all but two stunts, which is pretty impressive in a movie with a non-stop pace.  He intelligently allowed his cousin to do a couple of scenes; one which included falling down a steep cliff, which in turn resulted in broken ribs. It is only a matter of time before The Rock becomes Dwayne Johnson.  

He expressed a desire to return to wrestling, saying he loves the business and the comradery with the boys in the back.  

One has to believe though, that if things continue at this pace, with The Rundown in all likelihood being tops in the box office, that we will see everything but rock bottom for years to come.

Subheadline: Some Devil: Matthew's solo album leaves lasting impression
Author: Alex Granado / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Bravo Dave, bravo.

Some Devil, Dave Matthews' first solo studio album, combines his intricate guitar play and soulful lyrics (along with a sitar guitar, a gospel choir and a full orchestra) to produce a captivating compilation of songs capable of bringing down entire civilizations it's so good.

Well, maybe not that good, but you get my point.

Now, if you're looking for some crazy licks reminiscent of "What Would You Say" or "Rapunzel" from Under the Table and Dreaming and Before These Crowded Streets, respectively, you might be disappointed. 

Devil follows the path Matthews began to take back when Everyday was released; it's a mellow, relaxed piece of work you can listen to under an oak tree on a breezy, autumn afternoon.

Tracks like "Dodo" and "So Damn Lucky" both have terribly catchy rhythms you'll be humming all day, while Matthews puts out a raw, upbeat, bluesy-type track in "Save Me," followed by the slower, slightly gloomy "Stay or Leave." 

Matthews even puts out an acoustic version of the first single off the disc, "Gravedigger," a deep song about death and the tragedy surrounding it.

Short of selling his soul to the devil himself, it sounds like Matthews did just about everything else to make this album as instrumentally diverse as he could. 

He employed his long time friend, guitarist Tim Reynolds and the Seattle Music Group Orchestra throughout the disc, the Total Experience Gospel Choir on "Save Me," and a slew of other talented musicians as well.

I love this disc like a fat kid loves cake, I guess you could say.

On a scale of one to five, I'll have to give Matthews and Devil a resounding four. Let's break it down.

Devil gets one star for being a Matthews production. Simple as that. It gets one more for capturing a combination of great lyrics and, simply put, great guitar work. 

Another for putting a full orchestra in most songs and not letting it overtake the album, and finally, one more for putting a bonus disc in there with some live tracks.

I mean, really. What's a Dave Matthews's album without some live tracks?

The only downside to this disc, remembering my previous comments, is that it doesn't include some of those crazy solos of his from earlier albums with "The Band." 

But even then, Devil stands out as an amazing album, and sets the bar for his future works.

Attention all jazz fans! 

From swing kids to beatniks, the young and the old, everyone is invited to local radio station 88.9 WDNA's Eighth Annual Miami Jazz Film Festival. 

The week-long celebration of the classic music genre will take place in scenic Coral Gables the second week of October. 

With 23 films, several shorts and even cartoons for the kids, this affair has something for everyone. Think you don't have enough experience in the jazz department? Well, come down and learn how to be truly cool.

 The festival, whose theme is "The Year of the Blues," opens with two new films, "The Last of the Mississippi Jukes" by filmmaker Robert Mugge, and "Howlin' Wolf" by Don McGlynn. 

The film portion of the festival boasts a list of more than 10 premieres and contributors, including France, Germany, Canada, Spain, Argentina and the United States. 

Miami filmmaker Charles Ruiz de Castilla is also scheduled to present a short entitled "Delta Blues." Spanish director Carlos Caracas will be on hand to present some of his films. 

Flamenco, the equivalent to Spanish blues, will be showcased as well at the event. 

"Chano Dominguez: Oye Como Viene," as well as a world premiere performance by pianist Bebo Valdes and singer Diego Cigala entitled "La Cocina De Bebo Y Cigala," should invoke the Latin beat Miami thrives on. 

The vibe of Afro-Cuban influence will also move the crowd as the group Mantra performs fusion hits off their album/DVD Light Speed Swing. The presentation preceding the performance on Tuesday includes a compilation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation entitled "Rhapsody in Black." The piece is a collection of rare, formerly buried archives of such notable stars as Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, and, among others, Sammy Davis Jr.

Speaking of the Rat Pack member, Canada also has Ol' Blue Eyes at his prime in "This Is Sinatra!" and "September Songs: The Music of Kurt Weill," featuring artists Elvis Costello and Betty Carter among others. 

Now, with all the name-dropping done above, dear reader, you may feel a little intimidated and out of sorts, but give the festival a chance! 

Children of all ages are encouraged to attend a free presentation of jazz cartoons on Oct. 11. 

These include a portrait of a music-maker extraordinaire in "Quincy Jones: In the Pocket," featuring the talents of Art Blakey, Jimmy Smith and Freddy Hubbard, and "Cameras Take Five," an animated tribute to the music of Dave Brubeck.

To finish up the amazing festival, a dedication to jazz and dance will be presented with films and live performances. Lena Horne's classic film "Stormy Weather" will be shown in addition to "About Tap," a documentary narrated by the late, great Gregory Hines. 

FIU faculty member Katherine Kramer will be teaching dance workshops during the afternoon in preparation for the feature that will take place on Oct. 16, later in the evening. 

Kramer, who has been a major player in the resurgence of jazz and tap dance for the past 30 years, will take the stage with Nicole Yarling and friends to hoof it up and show the crowd how it's really done.

All in all, the Eighth Annual Miami Jazz Film Festival promises to be a great one.

The festival will run from Oct. 10-16 at the Teatro Avante in Coral Gables. 

Tickets are available for $6 by calling 305-662-8889 or on miamijazzfilmfestival.org.

Headline: Former FIU teammates back together in NBA
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It's just like old times again for Raja Bell and Carlos Arroyo.

The pair, who played together for FIU from 1997-99, is now back together as members of the Utah Jazz.

Bell, who spent last season as a member of the Dallas Mavericks, agreed to a two-year deal with Utah on Sept. 26. Terms of the contract were not disclosed. Pending a physical, Bell is expected to officially sign a contract sometime this week.

The 6-5 guard started 32 games for the Mavericks last season, averaging 3.1 points in 15.6 minutes per game, helping Dallas to a league-best 60-22 regular season record.

Bell played for the Philadelphia 76ers from 2000-02. He made a name for himself with his tough defense in the 2000-01 NBA Playoffs, being used by Coach Larry Brown to cover the Milwaukee Bucks' Ray Allen and then the Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant in the NBA Finals.

Arroyo, FIU's career assist leader with 342, played for the Jazz last season, primarily as a backup to John Stockton.

Arroyo averaged 2.9 points and 1.9 assists for Utah during the 2002-03 season, and could see an increase in playing time this year with the retirement of Stockton.

Arroyo made his debut with the Toronto Raptors in 2000-01 and played for the Denver Nuggets in 2001-02.

Arroyo and Bell combined for 1,950 points during their FIU careers, ranking fifth and sixth individually on FIU's all-time scoring list.

Headline: Rosenberg off to sizzling start, earns ASC honors
Author: Steve Perhla and Nasser Khalil/Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Roy Rosenberg is back and better than ever. 

After being named FIU's starting goalkeeper after losing his position to Shawn Crowe late last season, Rosenberg has started the 2003 campaign red hot, allowing only 11 goals in 10 games (1.1 goals per game).

Rosenberg was especially solid last week, allowing two combined goals in two games against FAU and Jacksonville, earning him Atlantic Soccer Conference Player of the Week honors. The senior allowed just one goal in 110 minutes in a double-overtime tie against FAU on Sept. 17 and allowed one goal in a 3-1 win over Jacksonville on Sept. 21.

"Roy right now is playing as well as I could hope and has made some great saves. He is really providing us with a great deal of stability back there," said head coach Karl Kremser.

The accomplishment marks the second Conference Player of the Week award for FIU, after forward Carron Williams won the honor earlier in the season.

Rosenberg is being heavily relied upon now more than ever, considering that his backup, Crowe, is currently academically ineligible.

 "We really have to rely on Roy and he realizes that. We've spoken about it but if he continues to play like he is at the moment, we can't ask for more than that," Kremser said.

But for Rosenberg, his early success would not be possible without his defenders, specifically Mark Stephenson, Bobby Boswell, Zachary Peoples, and Allen Handy.

"All my confidence comes from my defense which helps me do all this stuff," Rosenberg said. "I think it was the first game or maybe the second [of the season] that [the defense] started organizing, picking it up and putting everything together. So it's my team that [is responsible] for me winning the [Conference] Player of the Week."

But Rosenberg knows he has to stay more focused to ensure that what happened last year - losing the starting job right before the postseason - will not happen again.

"Last year I played all year, and then we get to the NCAA Tournament and I didn't play. I can't tell you how much it hurt me, and I don't want it to happen again, so I am trying to stay focused all year," Rosenberg said.

And according to Rosenberg, who spent the entire offseason rehabbing, the key is staying not only physically strong, but mentally tough as well.

"I didn't practice for seven or eight months, so in the beginning it was kind of hard for me... but I have prepared myself really, really good mentally for this year because it's my senior year and I want to finish good," Rosenberg said.

"I want people to remember Roy Rosenberg."

Sept. 26- Ark. State 3, FIU 2

After winning the New Hampshire Tournament a week ago, the Golden Panthers returned home Sept. 26 looking to build off their hot start.

But leading two sets to one in the fourth set and holding a 22-16 lead, FIU fell apart, allowing the Indians to take control of the match resulting in a 3-2 win for Arkansas State at the Golden Panther Arena.

"The fourth game we were in the lead , but I think we just let go. I don't know what it was, so I can't even describe what happened," said senior Adriana Fundora.

Jennifer Owens led FIU with 17 kills while hitting .438 for the match. Gierdre Tarnauskaite led ASU with 20 kills. 

FIU lost the first set 30-19 but took a 2-1 lead after winning the second set 30-18 and 30-23.  

Four lead changes and eight tie scores later, ASU took four of the last five points of the fourth set to win it 30-27, sending the match into a fifth and final set.

Said senior Betsy Moreland: "We didn't come out strong enough and when we finally got the momentum [in the fourth game], we let it slip. 

"But they were just on fire, committed no errors and we just let it slip away."

ASU was too much for FIU down the stretch as the Indians took the decisive fifth set 15-7. 

Tarnauskaite led ASU with five kills in the final set.

"The game was very disappointing. We just let go for whatever reasons," head coach Cookie Stevens said.

Senior Adriana Fundora had a double-double for FIU with 12 kills and 14 digs. Betsy Moreland continued tallying up assists, recording 60 in the match. It was the third time this season she reached the 60 mark. Debra Amundson established a career high with 18 kills.

The Golden Panthers also received excellent effort from seniors Jessica Jones and Julie Doan.

Jones finished with 15 kills and 10 digs and Doan recorded 16 kills.

The loss dropped FIU to 8-5 for the season and 0-1 in conference play.

Sept. 28- FIU 3, UALR 1

The Golden Panthers, looking to recover from the letdown against Arkansas State, responded with a 3-1 home victory over conference foe Arkansas-Little Rock on Sept. 28 at the Golden Panther Arena.

The win marked the team's first conference win of the season.

"We need to put conference games under our belt so we can get to the Conference Tournament. We're excited because it's a conference win," said senior Adriana Fundora.

After blowing a late six-point lead in match set against ASU on Sept. 26, FIU wanted to come out strong in this game, but fell behind early, losing the first set 30-25.

"[ASU] blocked us severely in the first game. The first game it seemed like we were a blocking magnet. We hit into their blocks and I think we were a little intimidated," head coach Cookie Stevens said. 

"There were so many emotions going on through disappointment, embarrassment and frustration after Friday's game because we knew we should have had that match," Stevens added.

But eventually those emotions turned into motivation for the Golden Panthers as they took the next three sets, 30-23, 30-20, and 30-23.

"I think we needed a win to boost our confidence up again, because we lost two straight and that's not usual, you know. We never do that, so we knew we needed a win to boost our confidence to get ready for the next conference match," Fundora said.

"Our motto is to bounce back like Tigger," Stevens said, referring to the team's senior leader Fundora, who is nicknamed after the famous Winnie the Pooh character. 

"We came through in the second game. Adriana led the way, and we made them play defense. Once we made them play defense, then we got the game back in control," Stevens added.

Fundora was brilliant for the Golden Panthers, recording 19 kills and 18 digs, and a team-high .333 hitting percentage. 

Three other FIU players had double-digit kills: seniors Jennifer Owens (17), Julie Doan (14) and Debra Amundson (10). Amundon's 10 kills were a career-best.

"We had some really good performances in Debra Amundson and Danielle Dubetz came in and provided some blocking for us," Stevens said.

Ivana Vracar led the Trojans (9-6) with 20 kills and 13 digs in the losing effort.

The win improved the Golden Panthers to 9-5, (1-1 SBC) who look to add another conference win against South Alabama in Mobile, Ala. on Oct. 4.

FIU's next home contest is on Oct. 14 against Villanova.

Headline: 19th-ranked men's soccer wins twice, improves to 6-2-1
Author: Nasser Khalil and Harry Coleman/Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Sept. 26- FIU 2, C-SF 0

Winning doesn't always come in conventional fashion.

This was precisely the case for  No. 19 FIU on Sept. 26. The team overcame a one-man disadvantage to knock off Cal-State Fullerton 2-0 at University Park with many former Golden Panther players looking on from the sideline.

Despite playing a man short for the final 30 minutes of the game due to a Mark Stephenson red card, FIU relied on its hustle to take control of the game.

Head coach Karl Kremser was one man pleased with the team's effort.

"I think we brought a lot of effort today. [Cal-State Fullerton] is a good opponent, but I am proud of the ten who were out on the field," Kremser said.

Midfielder Lucas Scudeler almost got FIU on the board early when his shot hit the crossbar early in the first half.

But the Titans fired back in the 23rd minute when Yaron Shlomi's shot sailed just wide after a nice one-two setup by teammates Eugene Brooks and Brent Whitfield.

FIU retaliated two minutes later with beautiful passing, leading to a Carron Williams breakaway. However, Williams was unable to convert on the play.

The Golden Panthers continued to put pressure on the Titans in the 29th minute. 

Midfielder Billy Boswell found Williams on the right side, and dribbled to the endline where he cut the ball back to a streaking Allen Handy. 

But CSF goalkeeper Sam Reynolds blocked the defender's shot for a corner kick.

FIU escaped near disaster four minutes later when a questionable call gave CSF a free kick just outside the penalty box. Gordon Kljestan's hard, low shot snuck past a maze of defenders. 

FIU goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg, screened by his defenders, dove in the wrong direction of the ball, but adjusted, and made the save to keep the game scoreless.

"I told my friend after the game that was probably one of my best saves this year, because I didn't see the ball and the ball touched someone and I went to the other side," Rosenberg said.

The Golden Panthers had more scoring opportunities than Cal-State, but had nothing to show for it halftime with the game still scoreless.

It appeared FIU was on its way to disaster and a possible home defeat when defender Mark Stephenson was sent off for committing a foul from behind in the 60th minute.

But instead of folding, the Panthers surprisingly played better with a man down.

"Sometimes that happens. [But instead of letting down], our guys stepped up. That is a mark of a great team," Kremser said.

FIU got the scoring going in the 71st minute when a beautiful through-pass from Oscar Gil found midfielder Hendrix Emanuel. Emanuel surprised Reynolds with a near-post goal, giving the Golden Panthers a 1-0 lead.

Three minutes later, sophomore Samuel Eli-Dzegede, who was in for the injured Billy Boswell, sent a nice pass to the speedy Williams, who did not waste his chance to put the ball past Reynolds, finishing nicely to give FIU a 2-0 advantage.

"Carron is really starting to come into his own," Kremser said. He had some chance in the first half and we told him he has to start putting some of those away. But he is really starting to get more and more comfortable."

But the win was strictly a matter of the team's effort after not playing its best soccer.

Said midfielder Lucas Scudeler: "It was our hustle and focus that got us the victory."

Sept. 28- FIU 4, JMU 1

FIU's offense came out in full throttle with a dominating 4-1 over James Madison at University Park on Sept. 28 to win the FIU Classic.

FIU attacked early but didn't get on the scoreboard until the 31st minute on a goal by Allen Handy. Carron Williams assisted on the goal, which was Handy's second of the year, giving FIU a 1-0 lead.

"I am happy with the way we played. We want to improve week to week and we took a couple of steps forward with this victory," Kremser said. By halftime, the Dukes had no shots on goal. Goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg didn't get his first save until JMU finally had a shot on goal in the second half.

JMU proved no match for FIU in the second half. David Hope scored the second goal for FIU on an assist by Zachary Peoples. Chris Naqin, of JMU, scored the lone goal for the Dukes.

With less than 30 minutes to go in the game, John Pulido put FIU up 3-1 to secure the game. The goal took three bounces off the goalkeeper but Pulido was able to zip it past Kevin Trapp.

Kremser praised the efforts of both Hope and Pulido.

"I was very happy for David on his goal today. Pulido did a nice job moving the ball out there in midfield," Kremser said.

With a 3-1 cushion, Williams stole the show for the Golden Panthers. He scored his team-leading fifth goal on a pass by Hope. Williams attacked the entire game and displayed a tremendous amount of speed and athleticism as he was named the Offensive Most Valuable Player of the tournament.

"Carron is getting a lot more comfortable out there. I feel sorry for defenders trying to mark him one on one. Opposing team cannot press us because they know we will pass it up to Carron," said Kremser.

FIU had 18 shots on goal compared to only three by JMU. Rosenberg, who was recently named Conference Player of the Week, was also named Defensive MVP for the tournament.

Kremser was satisfied with his team's victory on the hot afternoon.

"I am very proud of the guys especially on their play in the second half. It was very hot out there, which took its toll on the players," Kremser said.

The win should move FIU up from fifth in the South Region rankings as well as in the Adidas National Rankings, a poll the team fell out of last week. However, the Golden Panthers are ranked 19th by Soccer America.

The Golden Panthers will now travel to play in a five game-road trip. Their next home game will not be until October 31. 

But the schedule does not bother Kremser.

"We will be alright with handling all those road games. Sometimes things like this just happen to accommodate conference play.

Billy Boswell did not dress for the game. According to Kremser, Boswell broke his foot and will be out four to six weeks.

"He was the best player on the team during the spring and we are just looking forward to having him back."

FIU now stands at 6-2-1.

Headline: Carson-Newman tramples FIU
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Head coach Don Strock compared FIU's  55-33 loss to Division II Carson-Newman  in front of 6,707 fans at FIU Stadium to a hurricane. The second-year coach was not referring to the rain, steadily present throughout the game, nor was he referring to the monsoon that came down in the fourth quarter.

Instead, Strock was using the hurricane in order to draw comparison to Carson-Newman's veer/option offense, which FIU prepared for thoroughly but failed to stop during the game. A week removed from a dominant performance in which they contained Bethune-Cookman's option offense, FIU's defense allowed 416 yards rushing in the absence of two starters and a key reserve.

"We had a week to prepare for a team that ran the veer," Strock said. "They ran when they wanted, threw when they wanted to and ran it down our throats. 

"That knowing, Hurricane Andrew was coming too, and you couldn't stop it either."

  Strock suspended safety Nick Turnbull, defensive end Daunte Foster, linebacker Gerrod Bodie and running back Diamos Demerritt for a violation of team and university rules. The players were suspended for Saturday's game and "we'll see how many more," according to Strock. 

The Golden Panthers struggled against an offense they have not seen much of and Strock hopes to see never again for the remainder of the season. The veer's aim is to spread out opposing defenses and set up one-on-one blocking schemes against the linebackers - providing larger running lanes for its backs.

"Our safeties were out of position and we didn't play two-deep coverages so it baffles me," Strock pondered, "why our safeties aren't in the middle of the field.

"I could tell you when the defensive backs are the leading tacklers in the game, you are not going to win."

Winning looked bleak for FIU from the start as Carson-Newman marched down the field to score two touchdowns while eating up 8:25 of the first quarter. 

The Eagles used drives of eight and 10 yards to take a 14-0 lead.

Despite being dominated for the majority of the game, FIU fought back at the end of the first with a couple of big plays of their own. 

First, quarterback Josh Padrick scrambled for a 20-yard pickup on third down and running back Rashod Smith took the next play 59-yards for the score. 

Smith outran three defenders down the sideline on the draw play.

Smith, who started seven games last season, was taking the place of the suspended Demerritt. 

The 5-9, 190 pound junior tailback rushed for 101 yards on 17 carries.

Smith's 59-yard run aside, Strock was not pleased with the play of his offensive line either as they were faced with a four-man rush and very few blitzes. 

"They didn't dog us, we were just getting beat by their four-man front," Strock said. 

"When you are breaking down in your offensive line, it hurts your running scheme and your passing scheme," he added.

Carson-Newman pulled away 31-6 going into halftime and staved off a minor FIU comeback to preserve the win. Touchdowns by receiver Cory McKinney and specialist Greg Moss brought FIU to within 15 (48-33), the closest the game had been since the first quarter (14-6).

McKinney scored on catches of 51 and five yards from Padrick while eclipsing the 1000-yard receiving mark for his career. 

Moss had two runbacks for touchdowns, a 99-yard kickoff return and an 86-yard punt return.

Moss streaked down the right sideline after following his initial blocks and eluding a few more tacklers with his jukes. 

The 99-yard scamper was the first kick return for a touchdown in school history. On the punt, Moss started off left before breaking three tackles - springing himself free and cutting back towards the middle of the field before scoring for the second time Saturday night.

"I got a few blocks, made a few cuts and then I just ran," said Moss, who has not scored a touchdown since he returned an interception for a touchdown in high school.

Despite the loss, McKinney felt as if he lifted weight from his shoulders. Last year's leading receiver reached the 1,000-yard receiving mark with 3 catches for 76 yards. He is the first in FIU to reach the plateau in his career. 

The first of his scores, from 51 yards, was a post pattern on which McKinney smoked the Carson-Newman defensive back en route to running down the middle of the field after the catch, untouched. His second score was a 5-yard pass from Padrick. McKinney came across the field and underneath the linebackers. 

His momentum carried him towards the sideline as he broke a tackle and nicked the pylon on his way into the end zone.

FIU outscored the Eagles 27-24 in the second half, something that has become a recurring theme this season.

"We are going to have to take a look at personnel," Strock said. "I don't think the effort was the same. I would hope coming in 0-3 we didn't take any one lightly. 

"But the good news is we got No. 2 Georgia Southern coming up."
