Hello. My name is Nicole Gutierrez and I am Phi Sigma Sigma's philanthropy chair for 2004. As you may know, Phi Sigma Sigma holds an annual Rock-a-Thon in the GC Pit to raise money for the National Kidney Foundation. This year our Rock-a-Thon will be held on February 25 from 10am to 10pm. Last year, our goal was $4,000 and we raised $4,658.46. This year we've raised our goal to $5,000. I thought perhaps you could include an article about Rock-a-Thon in The Beacon, if you have the space and the time. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

Thank you,

Headline: Pulido drafted in sixth round by Denver Rapids
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
All senior midfielder John Pulido wanted this past season was to lead the FIU men's soccer team to the NCAA Championship.

After falling a few victories short, he will now have to settle for the next best thing, getting an opportunity to play professional soccer in the United States.

Pulido was drafted in the sixth round, 55th overall by the Colorado Rapids in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft, which was held at the Charlotte Convention Center in Charlotte, N.C.  Jan. 16.

"I got a call from my assistant coach saying that I got drafted. I didn't think I was gonna get drafted because I was injured and had cancelled a flight to the All Star game so I didn't think it was gonna happen," Pulido said.

"But [Colorado] called me the night before asking me a bunch of questions, so I thought it might happen."

Pulido, the 2003 Atlantic Soccer Conference Player of the Year, led FIU in points (21), shots (59) and goals (9), helping the Golden Panthers finish with the 10th-ranked offense in the nation.

He was also named to the All-South Region First Team after leading FIU to the third round of the NCAA Tournament. 

But the Golden Panthers fell 2-0 to the defending champion UCLA Bruins.

Pulido finished his FIU career with 13 goals and 13 assists, just one point shy of joining FIU's top-25 all-time scorer's list. 

He now hopes to become the 10th former Golden Panther to sign an MLS contract. 

Forty-two former FIU players have signed professional contracts.

However, for Pulido to sign a contract with the Rapids, he will first have to impress coaches in camp and make the team.

"The coaches told me to take care of business and to just play. I think I have a good chance," Pulido said. 

"I don't see why not. I just gotta adapt as soon as possible and then I'll go from there."

But for Pulido to make the roster, he will have to raise his game to a much higher level and prepare his body for more conditioning than usual.

"I have a friend in the MLS that played here at FIU [Daouda Kante] and he told me there's a lot of running," Pulido said.

"You gotta get used to the running. If I do that, I'll be OK."

Another obstacle will be learning how to adapt to the unusually high altitude and cold weather in Denver, where the Rapids play their home games. 

"It's cold, but I guess I gotta get used to it," he said.

The Rapids finished their 2003 year in third place in the Western Conference and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. 

If Pulido makes the team, he will not only be looking to help the Rapids move up the standings, but will also be fulfilling a childhood dream. 

Said Pulido: "I've been waiting for this for a long time. I've always wanted to play soccer professionally. It's what I've always wanted to do."

Headline: FIU Baseball retires Lowell's jersy
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It was during a practice game while playing for FIU in 1994 when Mike Lowell's life changed forever.

"My sophomore year, I tended to be a little bit of a hothead, I understand. And I went 0 for 5 in a practice game and slammed my helmet down and my helmet jumped right back up and hit me right in the mouth and I got six stitches," Lowell recalled. 

That was when head baseball coach Danny Price and former assistant coach Rolando Casanova took Lowell to the side and scolded him with an obscene remark, putting Lowell's ego in check and kick starting what would eventually turn into an illustrious career.

"That was a huge stepping stone for me, emotionally, mentally, so I mean I think I just really grew there and things just kept going in the right direction from that day," Lowell said.

It was the very next game that Lowell recalled having a perfect night at the plate in which he realized his true potential as a baseball player that would ultimately lead to a Major League career and a championship with his hometown team, the Florida Marlins.

"That night I think I went 3 for 3 and then just got hot and had a great year and it just kept carrying over, and I don't know, things just worked out. And fast forward about eight years and signed pro ball and went up through the ranks and I realized a dream, really, in playing in a World Series and winning a World Series," Lowell said.

But for Lowell, who broke his hand in August, being healthy in time to play in the World Series would probably have been sufficient. 

But instead, he got more than he could have ever hoped for during the past year. The hometown hero, who was almost traded midseason, got to enjoy a championship parade and a trip to the White House just last week to visit President Bush. 

FIU didn't think it was enough.

With close to 600 people on hand, including his parents, friends, former teammates and coaches, and current Major League stars such as Albert Pujols and Raul Ibanez, FIU retired Lowell's No. 15 Golden Panthers jersey during FIU's annual Diamond Dinner in the GC Ballroom on Jan. 24.

"I stand here in front of you humble, somewhat embarrassed, but very proud to be a member of FIU and to have this happen to me," Lowell said.

Lowell, who played high school baseball at Coral Gables, played for FIU from 1993-95 and hit .353 over that span, the fifth-best career average in school history. He was also the Trans America Atlantic Conference's Student-Athlete of the Year and earned academic All-American honors in 1995. After being drafted by the New York Yankees in 1995, he moved away, but continued to pursue a finance degree at FIU during the offseason, even resorting to having his mother take notes for him while he couldn't attend class. Lowell eventually graduated in 1997 and was traded to the Marlins the same year.

To have the opportunity to play professional baseball in his hometown and having his college number retired in front of the same people who watched him grow up made the honor that much more meaningful for Lowell.

"I think it's extra special because I get to do it in front of my family and friends. You know, they got to see everything happen from the time when we struggled as a team to now being World Champs. I think that's a nice thing cause everyone got to see the improvement and everyone realizing how much talent the team had when they saw how bad we were at first and how good we are now. So it's extra rewarding cause this is where I grew up. To bring a championship is extra special," Lowell said.

And the championship the city of Miami is currently enjoying would not have been possible without Lowell, who led the Marlins in homeruns (32) and RBI (105) despite missing 32 games. 

However, despite the impressive numbers, you won't hear Lowell boast or brag about his success. He remembers all too well that he was in the same position FIU's current players, who are sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, facing the capacity crowd in black tuxedoes as Lowell holds a plaque with his jersey in it in the air, are in now. 

Asked to describe how a ceremony dedicated solely to him made him feel, Lowell responds humbly: "Weird, you know. I don't know if I deserve it. You know, I was just like those guys on the team that were sitting there, hoping to sign pro contracts, you know. I know what it is to be in their shoes. I guess I can be an example of what you can become if you work hard and you're willing to sacrifice. So it's very special. Everything was very rewarding, very gratifying and to have a lot of people that had a lot of influence on me growing up, it was nice to have that in front of them."

So now, when FIU fans, players and coaches look out to centerfield, they will see Lowell's jersey number on the fence, honoring a player who once dominated the college game and reminding current and future players the opportunities that FIU baseball can generate.

"It's a great accomplishment. You know, we've had a lot of guys sign professional contracts. By no means was I anyone who was the highest pick ever to come out of this college or anything. But to have this, you know, and tell me they're gonna retire my number was very rewarding. It's definitely an honor and I'm very proud. I'm very happy with the years I've had here at FIU. I thought I was treated with a lot of respect and that's all you can ask for." Lowell said.

Headline: FIU football hires a "Tiger" to run its defense
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After playing two years without a defensive coordinator, FIU head football coach Don Strock announced the hiring of ex-University of Miami linebacker Bernard "Tiger" Clark to fill the position on Jan. 15. 

After graduating from Tampa Leto High School, Clark went on to play linebacker for the Hurricanes where he was a member of two national championships teams in 1987 and 1989. In 1998, he was named MVP of the Orange Bowl.

"Coach Clark knows the South Florida area and many of the local high school coaches here, which should help us with recruiting. He comes highly recommended, is well thought of and I believe he deserved an opportunity to be a coordinator. I think he's going to do a great job for us," said Strock.

Clark knows he can help land top recruits at FIU, which begins Division I-A play next season. He spent the past four years as linebackers and special teams coach for the Liberty Flames, a division I-AA team. Prior to that, he was a defensive ends coach at James Madison for two seasons. Clark will also serve as FIU's linebackers coach. His biggest priority will be improving FIU's run defense. FIU surrendered 210.5 rushing yards per game last season and Strock is hopeful Clark can turn things around.

"He [Clark] was the linebackers and special teams coach at Liberty," Strock told The Miami Herald. "And he was the defensive ends coach at James Madison, so he's coached different parts of a defense, and that can only help. Plus, he will be a big asset recruiting-wise as well since he is familiar with the South Florida area.''

The first expected move by Clark is to transform FIU back to a basic 4-3 defense. Clark has always been involved with the 4-3, which is a formation FIU seldom used last season in favor of a 3-4. 

"The important thing Johnson instilled in me is knowing to have endurance. As a defensive coordinator, I want the guys to run with effort towards the ball, improve their tackling and know what they have to do to get it done. They need to know that they have to run the 4-3 the entire game and know their backup is just as prepared as the starter, which will help their drive to play harder because there is nothing better than competition," Clark said. 

Clark believes the 4-3 will not only improve FIU's run defense, but will ultimately decrease the amount of gaps in the defense.

"Both the 4-3 and the 3-4 have their good and bad points but the 4-3 limits mistakes. In the 4-3 there is more of a gap control in which every player has to cover his gap. In the 3-4, there are two gaps to cover, but we will still use it, but more in passing situations," said Clark.

Another problem Clark plans to address is better tackling up front, as the leading tacklers for the Golden Panthers over the last two seasons have been members of the secondary.

"It isn't good when that happens. You always want your linebackers to lead the team in tackles and that again will come with discipline," said Clark, who has already watched plenty of last season's footage. 

A third round selection in 1990, Clark played two seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals and had a stint with the Dallas Cowboys. He also played briefly for the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League in the mid-90's.

Headline: Men's basketball routed twice, stays winless in conference play
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Jan. 24 - ULL 78, FIU 58

It was the same old story for FIU against Louisiana-Lafayette. 

The Golden Panthers shot 32 percent in the first half, resulting in a 78-58 loss at the Golden Panther Arena  Jan. 24.

FIU trailed by 15 points, 39-24, entering halftime and never really got close after that. The Golden Panthers drew within 7 points with just under eight minutes to go in the game, but that was the closest Donnie Marsh's team would get.

Turnovers hunted FIU in the game as the team committed 16. The loss was FIU's seventh straight and put the Golden Panthers at 0-5 in Sun Belt Conference play and 3-14 for the season. 

The only player in double figures for FIU was guard Carlos Morban who finished the game with 15 points, but he turned the ball over  5 times.

At halftime, the FIU starting lineup accounted for only 11 total points, the same as Rajin' Cajuns' guard Orien Greene, who came off the bench.

The beginning of the game was disastrous for both sides. 

The teams were tied at 7 more than 10 minutes into the game until ULL went on a 12-3 run.

In the second half, FIU went on a 7-0 run with eight minutes to go behind buckets from Raphael daSilva, Taurence Johnson and a free throw by Marcus Robinson. 

After a timeout, the Cajuns came out and put FIU away on a three pointer by Greene, followed by buckets in seven of the next eight possessions.

"I don't take this easy. I'll say that, especially when you fight to get into a seven point game and you are right there with a very good team," Said a disappointed Marsh after the game.

It's tough, there is no question."

But FIU just kept falling short every time they got within a reasonable distance.

"We had three straight possessions and some stops. We had a four-on-one situation and then Carlos [Morban] turned it over twice. When you get stops you have to take advantage and when you're down you have to climb up," said Marsh.

Turnovers have haunted FIU all season and the problem doesn't seem to be getting any better.

"When we came back from timeout we came out really sloppy and gave up the ball and made bad decisions," daSilva said. 

"They just came out with that effort. The bad decisions took out the effort and heart we had. That's why they took the seven point lead to 20."

Despite Johnson's return  from suspension, ULL dominated the boards, outrebounding FIU 42-29. 

It was daSilva, a natural guard who moved to forward, who led FIU with 7 rebounds.

"That's a new position for me. I am still trying to adjust and it's hard because I have never played forward before. Coach needs me and I will do whatever he needs me to do," daSilva said.

Guard Laurie Bridges dished out 5 assists for ULL and scored 9 points. Both Brian Hamilton and Chris Cameron added 11 points apiece.

FIU guards Harry Lum and Robinson struggled offensively, finishing 1-of-8 and 2-of-12 from the floor, respectively.

The loss was hard to take for Robinson.

"It's a tough loss. There was a point where that one turnover broke our momentum. It's a real tough loss," he said.

The Golden Panthers have not won a conference home game in two years. For this game, a season-high 1,146 fans showed up, but Marsh has answers for his team's woes.

"We had a nice crowd, good turnout and I obviously saw that our kids were comfortable but we've just got to score the basketball a little bit better and can't continue to dig out of the holes we dig ourselves in," Marsh said.

"We just didn't get enough from enough guys to be able to beat a team that I believe is pretty talented."

Jan. 26 - NMSU 73, FIU 42

FIU traveled to Las Cruces, N.M. in search of its first conference victory, but fell well short of their goal in a 73-42 rout by the Aggies.

New Mexico State entered the game riding a four-game losing streak, but it was FIU who would have its losing streak extended, making it eight straight games without a victory.

FIU has only won one of its past 14 games.

The Golden Panthers shot 23 percent from the floor in the first half and entered halftime with the game practically out of reach at 35-14.

After Harry Lum scored the first point of the game on a free throw, New Mexico State went on a 26-6 run and never lost the lead.

In total, the Golden Panthers made only 12 of 38 field goal attempts.

DaSilva led FIU with 15 points, with 9 coming from the free throw line.

And FIU's defense had trouble stopping Kelsey Crooks and James Moore, who combined for 35 points.

New Mexico State shot 50 percent from the floor. 

After the loss, Marsh questioned the aggressiveness of his team.

"New Mexico State just came out more aggressive," Marsh said.

"They were a little more hungry and came out with a little more fire than we did. If you asked me coming out of that locker room which team had more fire, I would have said us. But there's a difference between in the locker room and when you come out and step between the lines."

Entering the game, both teams were last place in each of the Sun Belt's two divisions. 

Both needed a win to have any hope to qualify for the conference tournament, which is reserved for the top eight teams in the conference. FIU fell to 3-15 and has still not won a conference game yet, dropping the team to 0-6 in the Sun Belt.

"You need to get that one, because then you can tell your kids you can get that two. Our kids need to get in that position to say yeah, we know how to win," Marsh said. 

"We need to fight and claw and get that victory."

Added Morban: "We have been practicing and going at it hard but its just frustrating to keep losing."

But despite the rough start in conference play, the Golden Panthers still feel they have time to rally.

"We just need to try and stay alive and keep ourselves in the conference tournament. We could be losing now, but we can win the conference tournament which is an automatic bid [to the NCAA tournament] for the winner," Johnson said.

"We are going to bounce back and I think we will do good."

The players plan on using Marsh as inspiration and know they are running out of time to correct the mistakes.	

"I know [coach] is not liking it and nobody in their right mind would like it. It affects him a lot because he probably doesn't go home and sleep a lot," said Johnson. "He can only coach us for so much and we just need to get out there and execute what he teaches us."

Added Robinson: "To a point it has to affect you, but coach Marsh is trying to keep us positive and get better each day."

"It's in our mind that we have not won any conference games, but we just try to stay positive," he said.

Headline: Women's basketball falls to Cajuns, beats New Mexico State in conference play
Author: Kenya Teague/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Jan. 24 - ULL 58, FIU 48

The Lady Golden Panthers have never lost to the Rajin' Cajuns in women's basketball. 

Then came Saturday night's game as FIU was handed its first-ever defeat to Louisiana-Lafayette, falling 58-48, on the road Jan. 24. The loss was FIU's second straight- and third-in its last four games. 

The Lady Golden Panthers dominated the boards, collecting 19 offensive rebounds compared to Louisiana-Lafayette's 5 boards. The Cajuns shot 45 percent from the field, while FIU only managed to shoot 27 percent, the team's second worst shooting of the season. 

"We had a lack of confidence," said guard Deniz Boz.

FIU struggled from long range, only shooting 16 percent from downtown during the second half, while ULL converted 50 percent of their three-point shots.

"We  struggled real bad shooting the ball," said guard Allison Bustamante, who has a knack for surprising opponents with her deadly jump shot.

But it was Bustamante who went ice cold against the Ragin' Cajuns, hitting only 3 of her 13 shot attempts. 

Louisiana-Lafayette opened the game on a 5-0 run and led the whole first half. FIU came within 2 points of tying the game five times during the first half. 

Ivelina Vrancheva, who's ranked in the top 15 nationally in assists, only had one during the first half. 

Milena Tomova led FIU in scoring with 6 points in the first half and Jello Moore grabbed 5 first half rebounds. 

But things got worse for FIU during the second half. ULL led by as many 13 points, and missed jumpers and three-pointers prevented the Lady Golden Panthers from getting back in the game.

The closest FIU came to obtaining the lead was with 3:27 left on the clock as Tomova hit a three-pointer to bring her team within 4 points at 52-48. The hope of gaining the lead was short-lived, however, as ULL went on a 6-0 run to close out the game. 

"We played excellent defense, but the ball just wasn't falling for us," said Bustamante. "We started getting a little tentative. People started losing their confidence in their shots."

Tomova, who leads the Sun Belt Conference in blocked shots, went without a block for the first time since Dec. 6. Despite having no blocks, she led the team with 21 points and grabbed 6 rebounds. Bustamante chipped in with 9 points and 7 rebounds for FIU.

The Ragin' Cajuns had three players finish in double-figures, led by Sharee Glenn's 18 points. 

FIU fell to 8-10 overall and 2-3 in the Sun Belt.

Jan. 26 - FIU 60, NMSU 51

The FIU women's basketball team put on a clinic, demonstrating the essence of good shooting and how to drain the three-point shot in defeating the Aggies of New Mexico State, 60-51, at the Golden Panther Arena  Jan. 26. 

Allison Bustamante, a sophomore scorched the net for FIU, hitting 3 consecutive three-pointers in the first half , giving FIU a 19-6 advantage  seven minutes into the game. 

"It was a good confidence booster," she said. "The last couple of games I haven't been too happy with the way I've been playing, but [from] the opening of the game I saw how they were playing and I saw that I was going to be able to get some open shots."

Deniz Boz, a junior, also contributed for the Lady Panthers, hitting a number of key shots in the first half to keep the Aggies far from striking distance. 

"I trusted my shot," Boz said. "I shot the ball and I made it." 

FIU led by as many as 20 points during the first half and entered the half up 14.

The two top-scorers for New Mexico State, Princess Moore and Sinnamonn Garrett, combined to shoot only 3 for 18 in the first half.

"My first goal was to play good defense on No. 10 [Moore], their best player," Boz said. "It's all about defense."

But the confidence that was taken into the locker room at halftime was almost shattered at the start of the second half as New Mexico State broke out with a 15-0 run, giving the Aggies a one-point lead.

But FIU regained the lead when Boz was fouled on a three-pointer by Garrett. 

She hit only 1 of 3, but tied the game at 40. 

Jello Moore made a key steal and converted a layup to give FIU a 42-40 lead. 

Milena Tomova then scored 4 of FIU's next 6 points, capping off an 9-0 run that put the Lady Panthers up 48-40.

"We came with a lot of intensity," Boz said. 

But it was Boz's intensity that led FIU as she finished with a team-high 14 points and grabbed 6 rebounds. 

Boz and Bustamante combined for nearly half (27) of the team's 60 points.

"Tonight was a good night for me and it was a good night for Deniz,"  Bustamante said.

The win also seemed to raise the team's confidence after dropping three of its previous four games.

"There is no team that we can't beat in this conference," Boz said. 

"We have so much potential on this team and from now, we're going to win our games so we can go to the conference [tournament] in a good spot; it was our goal from the beginning," she said.

Ivelina Vrancheva was the third Lady Golden Panther to finish with double-figures, totaling 11 points and had a game-high 7 assists and 5  rebounds. 

With their win over the Aggies, the Lady Golden Panthers (9-10) climbed to within a game of .500 and improved to 3-3 in the Sun Belt.

Headline: 'Wake Up Wednesday' sends right message to students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Get involved. That's the message that Student Government Association sent with its "Wake-Up Wednesday" event.

But where SGA usually intends to get students involved in oncampus activities, this time its aim was to get students involved in the political process. 

In an election year, it is more than fitting that we reinforce the necessity of creating an educated student body that is actively involved with the changing political landscape. 

The event featured four guest speakers, two Republicans and two Democrats: On the Democratic side were Janet Reno, former attorney general, and Alex Jennings. The Republican side featured Mary Ellen Miller, chairman of the Republican party of Miami-Dade county and Marco Rubio, state representative of District 111 of Central Dade County.

But while the speakers' political alignment may have varied, the message to students was the same critical message: Students need to get involved and make their votes count.

Rubio arguably made the most poignant point that day: that a measly 500 votes decided the presidency of the United States, and the course of the nation for four years.

So even if only one quarter of the more than 2,000 students who pledged to vote in the upcoming November elections, had voted in the 2000 election, students would have had the power to decisively determine the presidency.

Rubio pointed out that Cuban-Americans and Jewish-Americans had been able to form strong voting blocs that allowed them to have a voice on controversial issues in which they were underrepresented and had a stake.

With so many financial aid and scholarship programs in the balance and tuition costs on the rise, students must also organize and become a strong voting bloc that will send a signal to politicans in Tallahassee and Washington they cannot afford to ignore. 

By voting consistently, students may one day be able to protect valued scholarship programs like Bright Futures, and maybe even keep tuition at a reasonable level.

Students owe it not only to themselves, but to their fellow Americans to vote this year and hopefully avoid another election fiasco.

It is good that so many students pledged to vote, but it isn't enough. They must follow through and cast their votes come November.

Headline: French religion in school policy contradictory
Author: Omer Subhani / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The recent proposal by the French government to ban religious symbols in public schools has stirred extreme opposition from those the law is targeting. The law's intent is to disallow the wearing of religious symbols in public schools such as Christian crosses, Jewish yarmalkes, Islamic headscarves, and Sikh turbans. 

The justification for the law is to make a clear separation of church and state, a belief held by many in its government that this is the best way to preserve their secular tradition. 

The French government has characterized the wearing of these religious symbols as being imposing on those who do not adhere to a specific religion or to those who are not religious in nature. 

The largest voice in protesting against the ban has been from the Muslim community in France, roughly a population of five million. They feel this new law would be a great hindrance to the practicing of faith by Muslim girls who attend public school in France. 

Wearing the headscarf by Muslim women is not something that can be compromised, such as a cross or a skullcap, because it is required by Islamic Law. 

Secularists in France argue that they are actually freeing these young Muslim girls from something they feel is being imposed on them by their faith, so in response they are imposing their own secularist views on these girls. 

The French government has apparently forgotten its own constitution, which clearly states that their government ensures "the equality of all citizens before law, without distinction of origin, race or religion." 

Furthermore, the French government has also evidently overlooked the European Convention on Human Rights that it ratified in 1974, where it states that all people have the "freedom to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance." 

Some misconceptions about the headscarf in Islam need to be clarified before continuing further. The main one is that it is oppressive to women, and this is what the French government has been arguing. The holy book of Islam, the Qur'an, clearly states that "there is no compulsion in religion" [2:256]. So a woman cannot be forced to wear a headscarf just as a man cannot be forced to grow a beard, though the religion states that this is required. Secondly, the headscarf is a sign of modesty and piety for women. A Muslim woman wears a scarf and she is deemed oppressed, yet a Catholic nun can wear the exact same scarf and she is seen as a devoted woman of religion. There is obviously a clear contradiction here.

As for the French government's claim that the headscarf is imposing on others, then I would have to say that this is a completely idiotic suggestion. For one, the scarves usually worn by most Muslim girls are either just black or white in color and have no writings or other Islamic insignias on them. It's not like the scarves are neon green and say, "Become Muslim like me." That would be imposing, but that is obviously not the case. Wearing the scarf is a personal choice by Muslim girls and it bears no impositions on others. 

Wearing the scarf is also not a violation of secularism in anyway. The whole point of secularism is to allow an individual to practice one's faith freely without any restrictions being imposed by the government. The claim that the headscarf is imposing on others is countered with a law that is now going to impose the views of the French government on the religious beliefs of its citizens. 

In attempting to separate church and state the French government has now just combined the two under its own control.

Headline: Irwin incident is a sensationalist croc
Author: Alexander Blanco / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
I was watching CNN the other day, over a cup of café con leche and a guava pastry, when I saw what Steve Irwin did something that garnered a whole lot of hoopla on those twenty-four hour news networks. 

The Crocodile Hunter fed Godzilla, his crocodile, while holding his weeks-old child. 

Maybe I am mean-spirited, but I thought this was kind of funny, the way the whole thing was being played out. But before a piercing light of recognition beamed onto my forehead and told me exactly what I should do next, I got to wonder what the deal was with all the hoopla about this latest bit about Crocodile Hunter and his kid? 

 The entire thing did have a false ring to it, a circus-like atmosphere, a bitter odor akin to overcooked oven goods, with the ugly accusations, the parallelisms to Michael "El Wacko" Jackson, the re-re-rerunning of the same footage just in case Granny missed it while she was in the john, et cetera. 

Why were we, or they, the news media as amorphous as a hydra-headed demon is a pretty good conceit, nowadays - so eager to prove Señor Irwin as an abusive, reckless father, and disprove him as an overzealous entertainer? 

The answer is not pretty, so I will refrain from an explicit rendering and will attempt a roundabout overture that will paint an impressionistic smudge closer to what truth is than what we are fed to believe it is.

 Now, this may come as a shock, but I will side with Senor Irwin in this argument any day of the week. You see, being a Hialeah native, I have come across this argument before - the one about the father, the child, and the group of people telling the father what he should do with his child while they shook their hips to the latest one from Queen Celia. The last time was in the midst of a political maelstrom with a cast of characters fit for one of those Chekov comedies that are not so much funny as they are bewildering and disconcerting. I speak of the Elián Gonzalez fiasco; that mishandled, mismanaged, and misconstrued tragicomedy that resulted in a WWE-like tug-of-war for the affections of a cute little boy and the dolphin he rode in on. In hindsight, the case of Elián Gonzalez does seem to trudge deeper and deeper into the mires of categorical absurdity each time my winding thoughts careen around it. It is much too much.

 As is Crocodile Hunter thing. 

I use the word "thing" over and over because I hope to hypnotize the obtuse reader with it - there is a point to this, but it may slip if you don't pay close attention - and because I can think up of no better word to use to describe what the hell is going on here. There is no story, only the illusion of one. And that is what this is all about, isn't it? The illusion of danger we see on our television screen, the sleight-of-hand fodder that is being dealt to us as top-notch reporting by the media while coverage of corporate theft, worldwide apathy toward the impoverished, and the ever-elusive Hamburgler definition of what "terror" really means seems always to be forthcoming but forever falling short between commercial breaks. 

 Diversionary tactics 101. And now I hear Hillary Clinton ripped one about Ghandi. Oi vey! Another one for the masses! Stop the press!

 So, here is the ashen fluff I was talking about earlier. 

Top-notch reporting is really not that topnotch, is it, when it utilizes polls and surveys on which way to slant the coverage; this is less uncloaked legerdemain than outright lunacy. Rename a dog a cat, and the animal remains the same, does it not? Only the name changes. As it is with dogs and cats, it is the same with the news. Call a feel-piece, or an op-ed piece a hard news story, and abracadabra, it becomes one. 

 That is when the la-di-da is a la-di-don't in my book. While I think Rush Limbaugh is a big, fat idiot, I am also of the faction that opines Al Franken is an imbecile on par with Michael Moore for obscuring facts and slanting data to fit his quixotic agenda. They are both infidels waging a piss contest on all of our faces. 

Whenever you can epitomize an individual for a less than stigmatic ideology leaning on bleeding-heart martyrdom, that is when the man becomes more important than the idea, and the idea, which was probably first-rate upon inception but discovered stillborn moments after, rides shotgun for the bearded lout or the keynote smarm with an ever-present grin. This is never a good thing, in my opinion; it is lazy thinking scapegoating faux impresarios of elucidation for an ethereal benefit, but it is dangerous thinking naming a spade a spade, especially when it is not. 

 And that was when the beam of light flicked on my forehead and said, 

Buddy, you are thinking way to much on this, better grab a beer and lay back down on the couch in front of the widescreen where the new Girls Gone Wild infomercial is on. So, I did as I was told, and amused myself into incoherence.

Headline: Wake-Up Wednesday
Subheadline: Rally urges students to become more involved
Author: Vanessa Gomez
&nbsp;
More than 2,000 FIU students promised to vote in the 2004 presidential elections this year. On Jan. 28, the Student Government Association sponsored a wake-up call to encourage students to be more politically active and to respond to their civil duty of voting. 

This event is a statewide program, which, for the past 10 years has been in every public university in Florida, except the University of Florida. 

For the past two weeks, SGA had a table in the main hallway of the Graham Center promoting "Wake-up  Wednesday" and passing out FIU voter "Promise-cards" to students. By signing this cards, students were promising four things: "I am a student of FIU; I am a registered voter; I am committed to FIU and higher education in the state of Florida; and I promise to vote in 2004." 

"I promised my vote and I will vote in these upcoming elections. I promised," said Raul Suarez, junior and English major.

"Wake-up Wednesday" took place in GC 140 at 12:30 pm. Clayton Solomon, SGA president, introduced the speakers. Janet Reno, the first woman in history to be attorney general was representing the Democratic party.  Mary Ellen Miller, chair of the Republican Party of Miami-Dade County and Marco Rubio, State Representative of District 111 of Central Dade County were in attendance representing the Republican party. 

The speakers posed their views on why students, and Americans in general, should vote. The event also gave students a chance to ask the speakers questions about the issues concerning them. 

 Reno, the first speaker, told the audience about her childhood experience in Germany. 

At age 13, Reno visited Germany with her uncle and asked some friends how they allowed the Holocaust to happen.

 Their answer: "We just stood by and let it happen." From that day on, Reno explained, "I promised myself to be involved." 

Rubio acknowledged the power and organization of the Cuban-American and Jewish -American minority groups. He used them as an example of how people can create a block and be able to be heard about controversial issues affecting one's community. 

"Every day I am amazed of the history of America," Rubio said. "Democracy is our protection from tyranny. It goes beyond voting, it is about public service." 

Miller had similar reasons as to why an individual should vote. She motivated students to participate in the campaigns volunteering for elections at every level, Miller said. 

After the speakers' presentations, the floor was open for discussion.  Solomon asked the first question: "Given the results of the 2000 elections. Why is it important to vote?" 

Rubio responded to the question saying that every issue the United States will face in the next five years, Florida is facing now. 

He said  after all the votes were counted with the technology available at the time, "500 votes made the difference between the candidates. Any difference could determine whom the president- the most powerful person in the world- would be."

Top issues as how to start a career in politics was also asked to the panelists. 

Reno, who responded to that question said any person who is interested should be engaged in public service, understand the issues necessary to help others, and always try to make a difference. She suggested students to join a campaign and do volunteer work for a particular candidate they might admire.

The Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program and prepaid programs were another of the topics discussed at the event. Students seemed to be concerned about the future of these scholarships. 

Rubio, whose two daughters depend on prepaid programs and Bright Futures as well, said he hopes for the best, but "as tuition rises, Bright Futures is endangered." 

At the end of the event, Miller, Reno and Rubio gave their last words to students. Once again, they told them what a great privilege it is to vote and motivated them to get involved. 

"If we all vote, never again will we see problems as in the 2000 elections," Reno said. 

Approximately, 250 students came to "Wake up Wednesday." Many of them felt this meeting had made a difference in their attitude toward the privilege of voting.

"I enjoyed the presentations of the guest speakers; they should have more programs like this," said Yamilet Torres, a freshman in Political Science.

Headline: Young campaign staffers  display enthusiasm
Author: Vanessa Gomez
&nbsp;
Their generation may be more likely to vote for the next American Idol than the next American president. 

But while young voters are often no-shows at the polls, an army of twentysomethings is helping to shape who captures the White House in November.

Behind every candidate, from President Bush to Gen. Wesley Clark, are young campaign workers from around the country willing and able to uproot themselves at a moment's notice to be a part of what 23-year-old Mike Moffo considers "a mix of a traveling carnival and military operation."

The Boston University grad from Mercer County has been clocking thousands of miles on his family's 1996 Mercury station wagon as he works to ensure Sen. John Kerry wins the Democratic Party's nomination.

His journey began in a "Kerry for President" T-shirt and shorts last August when he rolled into Sioux City, Iowa, to serve as a field director on the campaign. 

Five months later, he left the state after the nation's first caucus with his "Kerry for President" wool hat and coveralls not to mention a major victory for his team.

The celebrations were jubilant, but brief. Within hours, Moffo packed up the campaign office into the back of his car a dozen phones, a couple of desktop computers, and various "Kerry paraphernalia"  and took off for Delaware to gear up for the Feb. 3 primary. There was no time to visit mom and dad in Hamilton Township.

"As far as stability is concerned, there isn't a whole lot," Moffo said in a cell phone interview while he drove across Illinois. "On the campaign, youth and energy are essential."

It's no wonder that campaigns have long depended on the stamina of young workers, who are able to endure frequent all-nighters, low or no wages (the average pay is between $200 and $500 a week), and a diet of pizza and caffeine. 

Often, they share apartments with other campaign workers to save on rent, or they live with local supporters who open their homes to them.

While it varies by candidate, both Republicans and Democrats said 50 percent or more of campaign staffers and volunteers are often just out of college. Their political "war rooms" can look more like student government meetings, with campaigns serving as the first job for many recent grads.

"Campaigns are often the Petri dishes of political professionals," said Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Bush-Cheney `04, who started his own career in politics handing out leaflets for a county legislative race while growing up in Yonkers.

Whether it's making calls to voters, setting up folding chairs at town hall meetings, or campaigning door-to-door in a part of the country they've never been to before, young campaign workers are an invaluable resource, Madden added.

They also bring something to the table that many older adults lack: idealism.

"It's very emotional and personal for all of us," said Roxey Nelson, a Rutgers University graduate who decided to postpone graduate school and headed west from her Hackensack, N.J., home to Waterloo, Iowa. "You can work for money or you can find what you love and try to make money at it."

Nelson, who worked on state Sen. Joseph Coniglio's campaign in the 38th Legislative District, plans to pursue a career in political marketing. After she helped the Paramus, N.J., Democrat win a second term in November, the 27-year-old decided to sign up with Dean because she didn't want "four more years of George Bush."

Nelson said part of the allure of working on a presidential campaign was the travel. She's always wanted to drive cross-country, so venturing into the Midwest in her Honda Civic was part of the experience. 

After Dean finished third in Iowa, the campaign dispatched her to South Carolina to help build support in the February primary.

Christopher Anest, a 23-year-old from Nutley, was limited in the amount of campaign work he could do because of his teaching job in New York City. But the American University graduate still wanted to help out. 

He rose early on Friday to join a group of volunteers traveling to New Hampshire to campaign for Kerry before Tuesday's primary. The trip was organized by Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr.'s office in Paterson, N.J.

If Kerry earns the party's nomination, Anest said, he plans to campaign full time over the summer in part, he says, to woo young voters.

He finds it troubling that many of his peers don't take an active role in politics or even bother to vote.

"It's hard for me to understand it," said Anest, who says watching the Iowa caucuses on C-Span last week was the "ultimate in reality TV."

Anest, who interned for Kerry in college and caught the "Beltway buzz," said he hopes issues such as the war in Iraq and the economy will help motivate young people to exercise their right to vote.

But the numbers don't paint a promising picture.

The percentage of young voters has declined by nearly one-third since the voting age was lowered to 18 in 1972, according to a study for the Carnegie Corp. last year. 

The study found that 52 percent of Americans ages 18 to 25 cast votes in 1972, compared with 37 percent of the same age group in 2000.

Alison Byrne Fields, author of the study, said that all of the presidential campaigns appear to be trying to appeal to young voters by featuring "blogs" on their campaign Web sites and by talking about issues that are important to young voters such as college tuition costs.

Most of the campaigns have organized "meetups." And Clark's "C Company" tries to get young professionals to donate money through such events as "bar nights."

Fields said that if young people did vote, they could turn out to be this year's swing vote much like soccer moms in the 1996 presidential race.

"They're looking to be courted," said Fields, who used to work for Rock the Vote, an organization created in 1990 to help register young people.

 Fields said that often, candidates start out talking to young people but, by Election Day, they focus more on older voters they know will come out to the polls.

Anest, the Kerry volunteer, has at least one idea on how to grab the attention of young voters.

"I guess we need to get a candidate on American Idol," he said.

Headline: Father of Columbine massacre victim speaks in her memory
Author: Erika Taveras
&nbsp;
The Campus Crusade for Christ sponsored "Columbine Revisited: The Untold Story," an event with guest speaker Darrell Scott - father of Columbine victim Rachel Scott on Jan. 28 in the Graham Center Ballrooms.  

Visiting FIU for the first time, Darrell delivered the untold story behind his daughter's life. He shared his thoughts regarding Rachel's inspiring story, motives and faith.  In addition, he introduced "Rachel's Challenge," a view that aims at reaching out and encouraging others to show kindness and compassion.

The Campus Crusade for Christ  forms part of the Interdenominational Campus Ministry which provides students with the opportunity to engage in all kinds of activities and events, said Brian Owen, the metro-director for the organization.  	

After learning about Darrell Scott and his inspirational presentations, Owen said the organization decided to sponsor the event so he could come speak to FIU students.  The event was a success, bringing in a very large audience Wednesday evening.    

Rachel Scott was one of 13 victims in the Columbine tragedy that took place April 20, 1999,  the day when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold started a chain reaction of violence at Columbine High School in Littleton, Col.  Rachel was only 17 at the time of her death. Nonetheless, she had a strong belief that even at such a tender age she could indeed make a difference. 

"I'm going to have an impact on the world," Scott said his daughter would always repeat. She succeeded in doing so by teaching others how to build a relationship with God and by firmly believing that people should go out of their way to be kind because this, in turn, would make the world a better place for everyone.

"Rachel only lived for 17 years, but her life touched the lives of so many people during those 17 years,"  Scott said about his daughter.  About a week after Rachel's funeral, Scott and his other daughter came across a letter Rachel wrote before her death.  "My ethics, my codes of life" read the top of the letter.  Rachel explained in her letter that her main purpose was to start a chain reaction one by which people could go out of their way to spread kindness and compassion to others. 

"Five years ago, my daughter wrote this essay in the privacy of her bedroom, never dreaming that anyone except her teacher and maybe two or three students would read what she had written. She had no idea that I would be standing here tonight sharing this with all of you," Scott said.  Having visited close to 65 universities nationwide and around 400 high schools, Scott said this essay has touched the lives of approximately four million people and he hopes that the FIU community can also benefit from Rachel's Challenge.

 Scott emphasized the importance and impact of outside influences on the American youth.  "Eric and Dylan made choices in their life that lead to the violence that erupted in Columbine.  They chose violence to feed on and all of us are affected by the things we read, by the things we see, the things we hear," Scott said.  He expressed the importance of monitoring kids in order to avoid such casualties in the future. 

After Scott's discussion, a group of FIU students volunteered their time by becoming counselors for the night.  The counselors were available after the presentation in case anyone needed advice or to discuss a personal issue or problem.  

"We are going to be speaking to those people who need special counseling," said Nadia Fenelus, a sophomore and Political Science major.  

She is a  member of the Campus Bible Fellowship and the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship and International Relations.  

"Rachel's Challenge" presents a new way of looking at life and that is what Scott preached throughout the evening; the impact that he hopes his daughter's ideas can have on a person's life. But the focus was on the difference that little acts of kindness and compassion can make.

 If interested in how to personally apply Rachel's Challenge to your life, you can attend one of the chain reaction group meetings.  For a group near you please contact Teri.Coons@uscm.org.

Headline: "Perfect Score:" Teenage-thief flick lost in life-lesson rubbish
Author: Chris Hewitt/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
I'm a nervy rule breaker. No, wait, what I meant to say is that I'm a by-the-book drag.

OK, I'm neither, and neither is "The Perfect Score," which pretends to be the former but ends up more like the latter. At first, it seems to be a relatively edgy teen comedy about six high-school students who challenge the take-the-SAT-or-take-the-highway college admissions system by swiping the test instead of actually boning up for it.


During the early part of the film, the dialogue is fresh ("You're wired. The Red Bull did this.") and so is the attitude, particularly whenever Scarlett Johansson is on screen as one of the students. 


There's a future trivia question here, since as in "Lost in Translation" she is introduced via a shot of her panties, but her performance as a bitter, sardonic low-slung-belt buff is anything but trivial. Her part isn't much different from Ally Sheedy's in "The Breakfast Club" (the movie itself makes the connection), but nothing about the way Johansson plays it feels trivial.


The movie, on the other hand? Trivial. Particularly when it tries to have it both ways, and its "Beat the Corrupt System" theme morphs into "Learn a Valuable Lesson." 


The cast, which also includes the very funny Leonardo Nam, does what it can to keep things lively. But the movie's mildly subversive message is lost when it suddenly becomes all about "Be Yourself, Don't Judge People, Talk to Your Parents, Cooperate With Others and Work Hard." Oh, and "Take Your Vitamins," too.

Headline: Hollywood celebrates long history of hailing to chief
Author: Vance Durgin/The Orange County Register
&nbsp;
Hollywood's long infatuation with the presidency can be traced back to at least the early sound era, starting with cinema pioneer D.W. Griffith's "Abraham Lincoln" (1930). This prototypical biopic starred Walter Huston as Lincoln, and was a big box-office hit.

 
Huston followed up with "Gabriel Over the White House" (1933) a political fantasy bankrolled by William Randolph Hearst that makes contemporary films like "Dave" seem overly timid. Huston plays a conventional politician intent on being a "business as usual" president. But he's severely injured in an automobile accident and is visited by the angel Gabriel, who convinces him to make radical changes for the good of humanity. 


That leads him to govern as a benevolent dictator, using government programs to address social ills (but bringing in the Army to get tough on crime). Completed while Herbert Hoover was in office, the film's release was delayed by MGM chief Louis B. Mayer, a Republican, because he thought the film reflected badly on Hoover's policies. As it turned out, FDR became a huge fan of the film on its release, a fact that got Huston invited to the White House.


FDR turned up repeatedly in the films of his time, especially those from Warner Bros. (Jack Warner was a big FDR backer). In the musical "Footlight Parade" (1933), a Busby Berkeley musical number features images of FDR and the NRA eagle symbol (that's Roosevelt's National Recovery Act, not the gun group).


FDR's most notable Warner cameo came in "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (1942), with Jack Young as a warm, paternal chief executive who gives the Medal of Honor to James Cagney's George M. Cohan. But Young isn't heard on the soundtrack. Instead, Art Gilmore, later familiar to early TV viewers as Red Skelton's announcer and the narrator of TV's "Highway Patrol," supplies the president's voice ("Well, that's about as good a definition of America as any I've ever heard").


Prewar, Lincoln remained a popular screen subject, shown by two biopics, "Young Mr. Lincoln" (1939) starring Henry Fonda and "Abe Lincoln in Illinois," (1940) with Raymond Massey.


The war years saw Van Heflin as an Andrew Johnson battling impeachment in "Tennessee Johnson" (1943), plus the biggest Hollywood presidential tribute of the time, "Wilson," (1944). This lengthy, costly biopic of President Wilson was a pet project of Twentieth Century-Fox studio head Darryl F. Zanuck, who thought the president's story an important one for wartime audiences. Audiences disagreed and the movie became one of Hollywood's more notable flops.


Maybe for that reason the presidency went on something of a hiatus in the 1950s, though Ralph Bellamy was a memorable FDR in "Sunrise at Campobello" in 1959.


By the 1960s, filmmakers were back to fictional presidents, either grimly facing major problems (Henry Fonda in "Fail Safe," Fredric March in "Seven Days in May," both 1964) or as objects of satire (Peter Sellers' Adlai Stevenson-like Merkin Muffley in "Dr. Strangelove," also 1964). On a whimsical note, a faux-LBJ turns up as a cameo in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" (1967).


By the 1970s, TV was offering notable presidential portrayals: JFK by Willam Devane ("The Missiles of October," 1974, and Martin Sheen "The Kennedys," 1983) and FDR by Edward Hermann ("Eleanor and Franklin," 1976). Sheen, of course, proved so presidential that he was tapped for "The West Wing" in the 1990s.


The `90s brought such fictional screen presidents as Kevin Pollak's Walter Emerson in "Deterrence" (1999) and Gene Hackman's Allen Richmond in "Absolute Power" (1997), as well as Bruce Greenwood's JFK in "Thirteen Days" (2000) and Anthony Hopkins' "Nixon" (1995) as well as the camera trickery that put the real JFK and Nixon into "Forrest Gump," (1994). Proof that Hollywood's infatuation with the subject seems destined to continue.

Headline: Cafe Olivas reinvents Cuban cafeteria
Author: Diane Mooney/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Like Paris Hilton in overalls, Café Olivas is not what it appears to be. Disguised as a Cuban cafeteria anchoring a mini-mall, the place looks the same as the dozens of other sandwich and batido joints that dot Southwest 8th Street. But there is that intriguing logo-avocado green with a pimento-stuffed olive representing the "O" in Olivas. And instead of a stout woman in a hairnet sweating over a sandwich press, chef/owner Ronald Brouwer mans the grill in the traditional chef's uniform, a white jacket and checked pants. Although Brower's does serve some of the usual cafeteria offering, his sandwiches are just as likely to come on a French baguette as Cuban bread and to include ingredients like Serrano ham and watercress.  Brouwer, a graduate of FIU's Hospitality Management program, has cooked at some of Miami's top restaurants and he brings a sophisticated flair to his inexpensive menu of Latin favorites filtered through a Mediterranean sensibility.


He takes a personal interest in his customer's dining experience. "I'm making you a steak, grilled rare," he'll say to the latest customer to belly up to his order window. "With some fresh cooked corn and tomatoes."


His father was an USDA inspector and the man knows his meat. Palomilla, a top round steak perfectly charred, is delicately flavored with garlic, parsley and lemon. Picadillo, ground beef in a Creole sauce, tastes like a sloppy Joe with a million dollar makeover. Bistec de pollo, so often dry and overcooked, is juicy and bursting with herbed chicken flavor. All entrees, which include 3 sides, are under $9.The picadillo weighs in at $5.95.


"Cuban food can be starchy," Brouwer says. "I want people to feel light and good when they leave here." To that end, he serves his entries with rice or crisp shoestring potatoes he peels and slices by hand, fresh seasonal vegetables he personally selects, or a tangy watercress and tomato salad in balsamic vinaigrette. His tostones, a dish that often tastes like fried newspaper, are golden coins of crispy plantain goodness. 


Sandwiches run from traditional Cuban favorites like the Medianoche, the Cuban sandwich's sweeter cousin; Elena Ruth, sweeter still with its smoked turkey, cream cheese and strawberry jam, and the always popular roasted pork to untraditional ones like the signature Olivas sandwich which includes Serrano ham, chorizo cantipulo, roasted pork, Swiss cheese and sliced green olives. All sandwiches except for the grilled fish with tomatoes and watercress cost less than $6.  Brouwer makes most of the food himself, a one-man cooking machine, but his mother-in-law whips up the desserts. Today coco rallado may be on the menu. Tomorrow tiramisu or a double chocolate cake.  


Besides lunch, Brouwer also adds some savory twists to his breakfast menu. Tired of eggs benedict with bland Canadian bacon? How about Huevos Havaneros, English muffins topped with roasted pork, poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce. Huevos Madrileños substitutes Serrano ham and chorizo cantipalo for that boring north of the border bacon. 


Currently, Café Olivas is open for breakfast and lunch only. But beginning in February Brouwer will be serving dinner Thursday though Saturday in a back dining room he's refurbished with cozy banquettes and color-washed walls reminiscent of a French bistro. Then he'll be able to shed his drab cafeteria facade and polish this fresh and inventive neighborhood gem.

Letter to the editor. 

My name is Admatha Israel, Representative at Large with the student government council at the Biscayne Bay campus. For the past year, I have been working on a project aimed at increasing awareness of the consequences of the Higher Education Act of 1998; more specifically, its role in the rising cost of tuition for college students at FIU and across the nation. My goal is to start a chapter of SSDP (Students for Sensible Drug Policy) here on our campus. Before I continue, here are a few facts you must first know.

*	In an age of rising college tuition costs, one of the best ways to keep tuition down is to increase enrollment. Simple mathematics tells us it's easier to pay a professor's salary with 40 paying students than with 20. But, since the drug provision was added to the higher education act in 1998, over 128,000 students have been denied federal educational aid as a result of their response to the question about drug convictions on the FAFSA.
*	The HEA drug provision causes more harm than good in many respects because it primarily targets lower-income families. Denying financial aid to students hurts only those students who need the aid. Children of the well-to-do need not worry about losing their college opportunities because they can afford the legal representation necessary to avoid drug convictions as well as the price of tuition without financial aid. Young ex-offenders are likely to be adversely affected by setbacks like the inability to raise tuition money and thereby sent into a downward spiral towards failure.
*	The HEA Drug provision punishes students twice for the same crime. If Joe Blow has already paid his debt to society, it doesn't really make sense to preclude him from an education. Students who leave college as a result of having lost their financial aid are discouraged from returning to finish their degrees. Receiving education reduces the likelihood that an individual will return to engaging in illegal activity; strengthening the point that education is the answer to drug abuse.
*	The original intention of the HEA is to make it easier, not more difficult, for all students to obtain a full education. To limit the number of students eligible for federal aid is counter productive and brings us no closer to solving the nation's drug problem.
*	The HEA drug provision ignores the major drug problems on college campuses today. Alcohol abuse kills over 100,000 people every year, however no one seriously suggests that revoking eligibility for financial aid would be a sensible approach to the alcohol problem. 
*	The HEA already excludes students receiving lower than a "C" average from receiving federal financial aid. The drug provision therefore only denies aid to students who are doing well in school.

As I administer surveys and lectures on this subject, people often ask me the same questions: What is SSDP? Why should the drug war be so important to college students? Why should we even care about drug users? The answers may surprise you. You see, we should care about users because these people are not just random strangers, but they are our brothers and sisters, cousins, mothers and classmates. People who use and abuse drugs should not always be viewed as mere criminals but rather people in search of a way to deal with their own personal hell. 

While psychology and medical science teaches us about the dangers of drug use and drug abuse, political science teaches us that criminalizing popular behavior is counter productive. Political science also teaches us that many government programs intuitively designed to help citizens sometimes don't work; from tobacco and Alcohol prohibition to SSI and welfare programs. Then again, how many of us are actually interested in the politics of anything?

Drug law is first and foremost unconstitutional, and if subjected to constitutional review, would probably not pass a test of constitutionality. But very few people truly appreciate the intrinsic value of our constitution to protect us from unreasonable government. It infuriates me to see how people can be so callous as to have wanton disregard for their civil rights. People like this need to be educated about the psycho-social and political implications of drug prohibition not just for their own good, but for the good of the future of our state of Florida and our nation as a whole.

Many people complain about politicians (even SGA representatives), but don't care about politics enough to participate in changing it. Where is the sense in that? Imagine where the Haitian people would be today on the 200th anniversary of their independence, if Toussaint L'ouverture just complained about French oppression, instead of having the vision to fight for freedom? Imagine if Rosa Parks refused to exercise her right to rational autonomy, and sat in the back of the bus (as most of us would have at that time).Where would we be today, if Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks behaved as we do, supremely indifferent to the struggle of the "wretched of the earth."

Some people, when presented with an alternative, resist it vociferously and vehemently, as if their very lives depended on the success (rather, failure) of draconian drug war policies. It is time for real change in drug policy, and to get it, it is imperative that we look beyond the obvious; or at least take a peek at the intangibles. 

We should ask ourselves new questions like: is it possible for a country to be free and drug free at the same time? Is it possible for human beings to exist in a world filled with decriminalized drugs without a crime wave taking over? Is the correlation between the increase in drug war spending and the increase in terrorism causal? Is it possible that legalizing certain illicit drugs will decrease crime and terrorism? If so, would it be worth it?

Doesn't it surprise you that of all the things that people disagree with on government policy, we actually buy our government's alibi concerning drug policy? Could it be that the drug war is more of a Trojan horse giving the U.S. government inside access to foreign countries and our private lives? 

In the end, no matter what is said here, there will be those who fight to keep the rest of society in this conundrum of "retrograde unconstitutionality." That's why this message is directed towards those who want change. See your local SGA representative and ask them about Students for Sensible Drug Policy. After all, change will come; it's just a matter of time.


Ps: Editor, please edit as you wish, or call me to clarify. This issue is very high priority with the Student government council.

Headline: End the Cuban Embargo
Subheadline:  
Author: itowe001@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
Okay, first off, I'm of Cuban descent, from Miami, and a member of the Republican Party.  Here's the difference: I'm using common sense.  The Cold War ended 14 years ago and the Soviets no longer have Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles in Cuba. Just because the Cuban exile community wants no American travel to Cuba means that we all have to suffer?  I have tons of family members I don't even know, and its a shame because I am not allowed to travel there. (Since I'm American-born) Rather than creating an international incident and ridiculous street protests when the Coast Guard repatriates an adrift Cuban raft, let's open up travel and business that would help both countries.  Today's a new day with a new generation that unfortunately is not able to see their motherland because of a dumb agenda. If we open up the state of Cuba, then we could possibly have more of a chance of promoting democracy rather than Monday-morning quarterbacking on the streets of Little Havana or Hialeah.

Headline: New Liberal/Centrist News Site - Drudge Report Alternative Launched! 
Subheadline:  
Author: rawstory@yahoo.com

Dear Beacon Editors,

I'm writing to let you know of a site we just launched, The Raw Story, www.rawstory.com, a liberal/centrist alternative to the Drudge Report. As a college journalist, we thought you might be interested.

Because we're just two kids a year out of college, we don't have the money to pay for advertising, so we're depending on email and word of mouth to get the word out. If you enjoy the site, please mention it to friends/coworkers you think might be interested.

Visit us often; we update constantly.

hope all is well @ FIU
best,
John
