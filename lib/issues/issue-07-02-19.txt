Headline: Past Golden Panther point guard recalls path to NBA
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Carlos Arroyo began his basketball career in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. He holds several individual school records, including the Golden Panthers' career record for assists (459). He is also the only FIU player to ever score 600 points in a single season, after scoring 615 in his senior year in 2000-01.

The 6-2 point guard has played for the Toronto Raptors, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz and Detroit Pistons and currently plays for the Orlando Magic.

Arroyo is also known for leading his Puerto Rican national team to victory against the United States during the opening preliminary round of the 2004 Summer Olympics.

In an interview via e-mail, the former Golden Panther talked about his basketball journey from his home country through FIU and the NBA.



Q: Growing up in Puerto Rico, how did you become involved in basketball? Did you have specific mentors you tried to model yourself after?

My dad was my biggest mentor. He showed me how to play the sport, and the sacrifice, discipline and dedication it takes. He was the one that really taught me how to play the game and love the game.

Q: You set a few records while playing at FIU. What do you feel were your most impressive accomplishments here?

Finishing the four years there. I knew it was going to be a big task for me to go to school by myself and living that new experience. I was young and immature and all I wanted to do was give myself a chance to finish the four years. I didn't graduate, but I finished the four years playing [like] I wanted to, and that was my biggest accomplishment at FIU.



Q: You've played in the NCAA, the NBA and the National Superior Basketball League. What has playing in each league taught you?

I think, mainly, how to be a professional, how to carry myself in a game and be a professional. Since I was a kid, I wanted to be a professional basketball player. And those leagues each taught me to be patient and grow in life and at school. Each gave me a different experience on how to deal, not just with sports, but [also] with life.



Q: As the fifth Puerto Rican to play in the NBA, do you feel you have a responsibility to be a role model for the under-represented Hispanic community in the NBA?

Oh, definitely, definitely. I feel that I want to be a positive influence in young kids in my country and hopefully one day they can look at me as a role model and somebody that did the right things and made the right decisions.



Q: What did you tell the Puerto Rican National team before playing against Team USA?

I think, mainly, when you play the best team in the world, you just have to stay together through the negative and understand that we're going to make mistakes. But we've got to play almost perfect. And that's the main thing we said.



Q: Where does the defeat of the US National Team rank among your greatest basketball feats?

It's the biggest win in my career. And I know it will be from now until I retire. It goes down in history as the biggest win and the biggest upset in Puerto Rican sports history.



Q: How often do you re-visit Miami? How often do you contact the FIU basketball team and old coaches?

I had one assistant coach, who is now the head coach at FIU [Sergio Rouco], and I talk to him once in a blue moon. But I don't have a chance to go down and watch the games because [in the NBA] we're flying all over the place and we have games. But I do have a house in Miami, so I go there over the summer and spend some time.

Headline: Other college football brawls need media coverage, too
Author: Geoffery Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
ven though I was at the University of Miami vs. FIU football game on last Oct. 14 at the Orange Bowl, I was getting some nachos when the fight broke out.

Four months have passed since I missed out on cheering for our team during the infamous altercation and I have since come to the following realization: other college sports brawls failed to garner the same coverage in the mass media - including ESPN and YouTube.

One recent college brawl includes a January fight between fans of two college basketball teams: Millersville University and Cheyney University. 

You may be asking if I made up those names, but I assure you that the schools exist - despite the lack of media coverage. 

No matter what news outlets may want you to believe, the UM vs. FIU fight was not the end-all, be-all of college sports brawls. 

Here are some more footbrawls that prove a lack of sportsmanship isn't limited only to South Florida:

Dartmouth vs. Holy Cross - October 14, 2006





Because the brawl at the Orange Bowl received heavy airplay on ESPN highlight reels and was the object of countless YouTube searches, nobody really paid much attention to the other big fight that occurred hours before the UM vs. FIU game. 

In this match-up between two New England schools, an altercation broke out after Holy Cross won the game 24-21 in overtime. 

Instead of the customary post-game handshakes, players exchanged fists. Anybody not in attendance had a hard time seeing the fight, because the game wasn't televised. 

Then again, ESPN.com quoted police chief Nicholas Giacconeas saying, "I don't remember seeing anyone using a helmet as a weapon." 

I guess we didn't miss much.



Miami vs. LSU - December 30, 2005





Miami's rough encounter with FIU wasn't the university's first notable fracas. Back in 2005, the Louisiana State Tigers blew away the Hurricanes 40-3 in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl.

Although both teams maintained adequate levels of sportsmanlike conduct on the field, all hell broke loose once the two teams exited through the same tunnel.

The fight, attributed to trash-talking in the tunnel, ended with a police officer wielding a taser and two UM players losing consciousness. An apology from UM athletic director Paul Dee deemed the situation "inappropriate," just like the Hurricanes' performance in the game that day. 



Clemson vs. South Carolina - November 20, 2004





In this football game, the Clemson Tigers beat the South Carolina Gamecocks 29-7, but not without a fight - literally. 

With six minutes left in the game, benches cleared when Tigers defensive lineman Bobby Williamson tackled Gamecocks quarterback Syvelle Newton and held on to him for a little too long. Helmets and punches flew before a 10-minute game delay ensued as police attempted to clear the playing field. 

The result: player suspensions and bowl ineligibility. On a side note, some of the fighting techniques seen in this battle eventually made their way into the FIU vs. UM game almost two years later. As you can see, the FIU vs. UM game wasn't the only game involving thrown helmets and kicked heads.

I just know that the next time the two teams meet, I'll buy my nachos before the fight.

Headline: Christmas letter brings player step closer to NFL
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For Chandler Williams, playing in the NFL had always been a dream. Thanks to a holiday gift that arrived in the form of a letter, this dream may now be a reality.

The day after Christmas, Williams received an invitation, not to a New Year's Eve party, but to the NFL combine in Indianapolis.

"My first reaction was not shocked, but rather surprised, because of the way that our offense played this year," Williams said.

The former Golden Panther wide receiver was fresh off a senior season that saw his team finish 0-12 and his chances of turning pro diminish, before receiving the invitation.

The invitation to the six-day, all expenses paid trip to the home of the Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts was greeted in the Williams household with tears of joy. 

Williams began training for the combine soon after.

Williams, along with former teammate Antwan Barnes and a slew of other NFL hopefuls, have been working out together in Davie, getting ready for the exact workouts they will face.

From Feb. 21-27, over 300 former NCAA football players will take part in the 2007 NFL Combine at the RCA Dome. 

What await them are fourteen of the hardest tests that will determine whether or not teams should even consider them come draft day.

Eight physical tests are conducted: testing speed with the 40-yard dash, the three-cone drill, and the 20- and 60-yard shuttle runs; testing jumping abilities with the vertical and broad jumps; testing strength with the bench press and testing ability with the specific position drills.

The final six tests are designed for teams and scouts to see the rest of the player: physical measurements, injury evaluations, flexibility, drug and IQ tests, and finally, NFL team interviews.

Williams knows the competitiveness that awaits him in just a few days but is confident that he can leave a lasting impression on the scouts.

"I want to show them that I could have played anywhere in the country," he said. "All the guys that came from big schools [that are training] with us, most of the time I am beating their times. When we run routes, there is no difference between what they are doing and what I am doing."

He has also used some of the experiences of current NFL players that were once in his shoes thanks to the plethora of talent South Florida has to offer.

"A lot of NFL players come back here and train us. I try and talk to them and see what they have to say. Lloyd Moss [a current Golden Panther], his brother is Santana Moss and I try and talk to him and see what he has to say," Williams said. 

Santana Moss is a former University of Miami Hurricane and standout wide receiver, who currently plays for the Washington Redskins.

"I just try and do whatever I can to make myself a better player," Williams said.

The six-day tryout gives invited players the chance to prove they are worthy of a draft pick in this year's NFL draft.

Williams said he wouldn't mind suiting up for a couple of Super Bowl champions come Sundays next season.

"I would love to play for the Colts with Peyton Manning or the [New England] Patriots with Tom Brady," Williams said. "[Also], Marvin Harrison; you could learn so much from him."

Although Williams' dream is to play next to either Super Bowl quarterback, he said he would be grateful just to be selected in the draft by a team. 

"It would be a blessing to play anywhere."

Though he has been training hard in hope of improving his draft stock, Williams has still been taking classes at FIU in hopes of graduating with a B.A. in criminal justice.

"I'm still taking classes at night at FIU," he said. "I'm not giving up on school. I have 18 credits left but if everything works out with the NFL, I won't be able to graduate in the summer like I had planned with my criminal justice degree."

Williams started nine out of the 10 games he played in during his final season, leading the team in catches and yards while scoring two touchdowns and being named Second Team All-Sun Belt. 

He was also ranked tenth in the country in receptions per game at 6.7 and finished his Golden Panther career as the school's all-time leader in receptions with 203 and second in career yards with 2,519.

Headline: Hardaway, Haggard prove homosexuality still stigmatized
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Former NBA player Tim Hardaway made a good point without even knowing it: straight men in America have a problem with their sexuality.

Hardaway recently made some comments about gay people on a local sports radio show after former NBA player John Amaechi admitted his homosexuality.

"I wouldn't want him on my team, and second of all, if he was on my team, I would, you know, really distance myself from him because, uh, I don't think that is right," Hardaway said.

Recently, Reverend Ted Haggard - who was accused of crystal methamphetamine-induced sex binges - released a public apology taking responsibility for some, but not all the accusations against him.

What is most unsettling about these cases is the bigger picture: modern American men do not know how to handle their sexuality.

Sociologists say that our culture is that of a hypersexual, heteronormative male patriarchy. Basically, men are taught by our culture to be desirous of women, and then dominate them. This culture dates back from a time where women were property and marriage was an economic transaction. Since this is a social aspect of sexuality, this applies to how our social interactions shape our identities. However, they are incompatible to our culture at-large. It is not enough to be straight, but to prove it day-in and day-out to our social peers, and deviation is not an option.  

"Haggard is completely heterosexual. He was acting out situations where things took place. It wasn't a constant thing," said Reverend Tim Ralph, one of his counselors. Ralph implies Haggard could be gay only if he had engaged in homosexual acts on a constant basis.

Apparently, real gay men are constantly in a state of "acting-out." By this definition, there are plenty of gay men who probably aren't gay anymore because it's a weekday. But these gay men can keep their gay cards, even if they aren't so lucky to be getting laid everyday

Sociological studies in the '90s have refuted the myth that gay men are more promiscuous than their heterosexual peers. Moreover, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses back in 1973 - our culture has lagged for nearly 34 years.

The problem is that we tend to pathologize homosexuality. Rather than viewing sexuality as a spectrum, as Alfred Kinsey showed in his studies, our society has made complete heterosexuality the only acceptable norm, and any deviations thereof equally "repulsive." 

This is a word we commonly encounter when we talk about homosexuality. Haggard used it to describe his escapes from normative sexuality.

A shot of tequila, a gas station bathroom, a sushi bar back-alley - these things can be repulsive, but not an identity. And that's the problem: we have an identity that exists in society that is so incompatible with the culture at-large that it inspires such disgust and hatred.

Ted Haggard and Tim Hardaway show us how ugly this hate can be, and how twisted it can get if we don't deal with heteronormativity.

Homosexuality viewed as deviance hurts not only homosexuals, but also everyone who has to live in fear of it.

Headline: WHO WIELDS THE POWER OF WAR?
Subheadline: Constition says Congress does
Author: David Focil / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In the scope of human affairs, few actions can bring about such terrible destruction and death as war. It is nothing less than the systematic slaughter of human beings for the sake of a political objective.

As the cold brutality of the Iraq war slowly seeps in through the filtered lens of the major news networks, we begin to ask tough questions of our leaders. How did we get into this war? Where are we going with it? And more importantly, where does the authority in declaring war lie?

The Constitution provides us with an answer. In article I, section 8, it is stated that Congress shall have the power "to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water."

In addition, section 8 gives Congress the authority to "raise and support armies," giving it the ability to decide how large of a force we have, and how much money is given to support its actions. 

Article II, section 2, states that "the president shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States."

If Congress can start a war, it can end it. What we see for the most part is a discussion of the power Congress has over the appropriation of funds for the military, which could be cut off for further operations in Iraq.

From watching the nightly news, it seems as if this is the only option Congress has to end wars, yet on Jan. 30, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing titled "Exercising Congressional power to end a war". 

"Our constitutional tradition shows that measures such as those now being considered concerning military operations in Iraq - whether they place caps on troop levels, restrictions on the introduction of new troops, or establish a date by which troops must be redeployed - are clearly constitutional exercises of well-established congressional war powers," said Harvard Law Professor, David J. Brown, during this hearing.

There is talk of Iran and the so-called threat it poses, but what can the President do on his own?

In 1801, Thomas Jefferson sent a group of frigates to the Barbary Coast in response to the pirating and kidnapping of U.S ships in the area. The frigates found themselves in combat after the pirates ignored U.S demands and opened fire. It was not until after this that Jefferson asked Congress to authorize further war with the pirates.

Now, looking at Jefferson's own words in his first state of the union address, we find an important point: "Unauthorized by the Constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense, the vessel, being disabled from committing further hostilities, was liberated with its crew."  

According to Jefferson, the forces he sent could only act defensively to protect themselves and any U.S. citizens in danger. By the Constitution, only the Congress could approve what he called "measures of offense."

Some might argue that the Constitution gets in the way of the president protecting us in these troubled times, and that he should be given broad authority to do what he deems necessary.

Those people forget who we are and what we stand for. They forget there was once a time when we believed that the powers of war should rest with the whole  government, not just one man so that the destructive act of war would not begin by whim or ideological crusade, but by reason and absolute necessity; so that we may be protected, not just from enemy forces in foreign lands, but from domestic tyranny as well.

Headline: Center aims to help women through seminars
Author: Camila Martin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In an effort to empower female students at FIU, the Women's Center will be hosting the Women Who Lead Conference.

The half-day event, taking place Feb. 20 at 4 p.m. at University Park in the Graham Center Ballrooms, is part of the center's goal to offer programs and services to women that enhance their intellectual, professional, social and emotional growth.

Patricia Ireland, the ninth and longest-serving president of the National Organization for Women from 1991 to 2001, will be the keynote speaker at the event. 

She was chosen by the Women's Center for her views on women's right to abortion, and the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups.

"She is an amazing women and a role model for what she has accomplished," said Suzzane Onorato, associate director at the Women's Center. "We invited her because she was the NOW president for many years and we are recreating the organization at FIU. She is also a feminist and stands out there as a woman."

Ireland was the prime architect of NOW's Global Feminist Program, and in 1992 the program brought women from more then 45 countries together.

Then, in 1996, she also wrote her first book, What Women Want, and spoke out about her life, struggles at freedom and domestic violence.

"Patricia Ireland is a renowned speaker, an active feminist and executive leader, so I think her speech is going to be very interesting and interesting for women to hear," said Wilhelmina Dagdag, administrative assistant at the Women's Studies Center.

There will also be five different workshop sections to discuss issues of women in government, politics, law, media and public relations, and in education; developing a strategic plan for women in business, community agencies, health and science, and women with disabilities.

Among other renowned speakers set to attend the conference are Annie Betancourt, former Florida State representative; Ana Menendez from The Miami Herald and Silvia Gomez, vice president of Ocean Bank.

The Conference is open to the public and organizers promise it will be an enhancing learning opportunity for women in the community and for students at FIU.

Although this is one of the organization's upcoming events, students who aren't able to make it to the conference are encouraged to drop by the center located in GC 2200 or at Biscayne Bay Campus's Wolfe University Center, room 256.

In the near future, the Women's Center is also planning the International Women's Day March 1, "Lust for Life - Lust for Women's Rights" March 6, Florida Women of Achievement March 10.

Among the services and programs offered by the Women's Center is the Mentoring Partnership Program to develop relationships between students, faculty, staff and alumnae mentors.

"The Women Center's two main areas of importance are to provide education and advocacy for women and to create a community of sisterhood," Onorato said.

Headline: Conference spotlights government jobs
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The number of retirees is expected to rise within the next decade as baby boomers reach their 60s. Because of this, the federal government is expecting a surge in job openings in a number of fields.

The second annual Federal Government Statewide Conference will be held Feb. 21 in the Graham Center Ballrooms from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. to showcase these job openings.

The conference is the brainchild of Kimberly Castillo, a student of the College of Health and Urban Affairs who had proposed the idea to Career Services. This is the second year the conference is being held.

Various agents from the federal government, such as the CIA, the Department of Homeland Security and United States Coast Guard will be giving presentations throughout the conference.

Most of the agency representatives will be from Florida chapters and branches, which will be a contrast to last year's conference where many of the recruiters were from Washington, D.C.

Ivette Duarte, a career consultant for Career Services, attributed this to the fact that the agencies have not yet received their recruitment funds.

Besides recruiting, agents will be available to discuss the benefits of joining their programs, such as the Student Pre-Commissioning Program, which pays tuition and provides salaries for junior and senior students through the U.S. Coast Guard.

According to Michael Rolph a representative from the US Coast Guard, CSPI is not only financially beneficial, but it is also a great way to serve the country. 

Much of the conference's focus is to expose students to the various internship programs available with the federal government. According to Duarte, internships can be invaluable when it comes time to finding a job after graduation.

"It's not that it's too late after you graduate, but it is much easier with internships," Duarte said.

There will also be a career fair and complimentary lunch in the GC Ballrooms. During that time, students will be able to talk one-on-one with the various government representatives.

There will also be a student table where students who have already had federal internships will recount their experiences and give interested students tips regarding possible opportunities.

The funds needed to run the conference where provided through the Student Government Association.

 "We were given $1,500 from SGA's discretionary funding this year, the same as last year," Duarte said. "We are hoping it becomes a line item in their budget so we would be sure to receive the funding next year."

The overall cost of the conference is roughly $5,000, according to Duarte. Between SGA's funding as well as funding from the USDA, the out of pocket cost to the Career Services department is minimal.

Duarte stressed the need for students to register for this event at www.fiu.edu/~career. Students who do not register may not be guaranteed entrance to the event.

The conference is free to FIU students while students from outside the University must pay a $10 fee. Business attire is also required to attend the conference.

"The conference will dispel the myth that you have to be a certain major to work for the federal government," Duarte said.

Headline: FIU gets new anniversary
Author: Angelina Troff / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU aged six years in a span of minutes at the most recent Board of Trustees meeting.

Modesto A. Maidique, University president, presented preliminary goals for "FIU at Fifty" to the BOT Feb. 16, and announced that the University would no longer be celebrating its anniversary on the year of the entering class, 1971, but on the year of its charter, 1965. The University's 50th anniversary will now be celebrated in the year 2015 instead of 2021.

Maidique said the goals were just "balloons," or ideas, for now and wanted more faculty input. Among the new ambitions was to weave "international" into the fabric of the curriculum by possibly having a second language requirement and an international focus across all disciplines.

Alfonso "Alfie" Leon, Student Government Council at University Park president and trustee, was in favor of both initiatives.

"We live in a global community. If we have 21st century graduates, we need to educate them as global thinkers. By 2015, hopefully we can develop a pilot program if not already have one stabilized," Leon said.

However, Bruce Hauptli, Faculty Senate chairperson and trustee, believes it is financially unrealistic to pursue this in addition to our current grand initiatives within the next eight years.

"These are things we can do if we cut out the Medical School and football program. It should be done with the time frame in mind," he said. "Trail balloons must be attached to the land. They cannot float so far above reality."

Hauptli also expressed concern that students may no longer be able to graduate on time with the new "international" requirements.

Leon is more optimistic regarding funding for these initiatives.

"If $1 million is donated to a department with a $3 million budget, it can do a lot. This is the purpose of the capital campaign," Leon said.

Amiss from the BOT meeting agenda was a discussion on the use of funds from the Health Fee increase of $13.20 ($54 to $67.20) passed in Spring 2006. At the budget hearing before the decision, students were promised that clinic hours would expand as a result of the increased fee revenues.

"We didn't want an increase in the fee, but if there was going to be an increase, we needed to see more hours," Leon said.

Beginning in January, clinic hours were extended on Tuesdays for two hours, closing at 7 p.m. instead of 5 p.m.

At the Feb. 14 SGC-UP meeting, the Student Health Advisory Committee report by Rebecca Louisdor announced that the extended hours were revoked effective immediately due to several issues stemming from lack of finances.

In an e-mail sent Feb. 12, Robert Dollinger, executive director for University Health Services, outlined three main reasons for the decision: "Lack of staffing…, student/staff safety after dark…, and lack of back-up support should an emergency walk through clinic doors."

In a telephone interview with The Beacon, Dollinger noted that aside from lack of funds, the separation of UP and the Biscayne Bay Campus caused staffing issues.

"A lot of inefficiencies are created by splitting staff into two separate operations," Dollinger said. "If we combined the staff at [BBC] and UP, we would have an amazing staff."

The director also mentioned a meeting Feb. 19 with Baptist Medical Center to secure discounts for FIU students after hours.

"Having such a large discounted urgent care network available for students is a huge advantage over having the FIU clinic open for only two hours and only one night. As you know, emergencies can happen at any time, 24/7," Dollinger wrote in his e-mail.

He also said that there are no plans to send a University-wide e-mail regarding the change in clinic hours at this time but all marketing has been withdrawn. There will be a forum regarding this and other health issues Feb. 27.

Trustees Miriam Lopez, Sergio Pino and Claudia Puig were absent from the meeting.

According to their website, http://www.fiu.edu/trustees/, "The Board is responsible for cost-effective policy, implementing and maintaining high-quality education programs consistent with the University's mission, performance evaluation, and developing a process meeting state policy, budgeting, and education standards."

The BOT consists of 13 members: five are appointed by the state Board of Governors, six are appointed by the governor. FIU faculty and students elect the two remaining trustees. The Faculty Senate chairperson represents the faculty and the SGC-UP president represents students.

The last BOT meeting for this academic year will be held April 20.

Headline: Gator sightings continue at UP
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU may have to change its mascot to an alligator after one smaller than four-feet long made its way to University Park through the county-wide canal system from the Everglades.

The alligator was first spotted in November, but others have seen it more recently. 

"It doesn't bother me as long as the safety of the people on campus is guaranteed and the safety of the gator is guaranteed," said Evan Koch, associate media relations director at FIU. Koch spotted the alligator two weeks ago in the pond near the Public Safety building.

After receiving complaints and concerns about the alligator, officials from the Department of Fish and Wildlife were brought in to remove it. However, officials did not remove the alligator, citing that the animal was not a nuisance or threat.

According to the department's website, alligators less than four feet long are fearful of humans and are not capable of eating anything larger than a small turtle.

"As long as people obey the rules, it's pretty easy to live with alligators," said Gary Morse, a Florida Fish and Wild Life Conservation Commission spokesperson.

Though the alligator has made UP its permanent residence, Joel Heinen, chair of the department of environmental studies, said this isn't the first time there has been an alligator on campus.

 "It's not that uncommon for them to come into urban areas. I've seen them in west Kendall and Kendall Lakes," Heinen said. "We're only a few miles away from the main part of Tamiami canals that go into the water management districts and then into the Everglades."

Heinen, who wrote his doctorial dissertation on reptiles and amphibians while at the University of Michigan, said that he couldn't understand why anybody would be scared of a four-foot alligator.

"Even 12-footers, I just kind of walk up to them when I'm in the Everglades. If they're basking, all they do is hiss," he said. "Anything that small isn't going to be considered a problem. Whether it's a male or a female, once it eventually gets to be a certain size, if it's still anywhere around here, it's just going to head back West and try and find a mate when that time comes."

Heinen said alligators regularly make college campuses and golf courses their homes. 

Brandon Crone, a junior at the University of Florida, said that students don't even notice the vast amount of gators that live on their campus. 

"Nobody makes a big deal about it. At night you're definitely going to see one," Crone said. "There's no problem with gators … I'm more surprised that there's an excessive amount of squirrels on campus."

Raj Harnarine, an FIU junior majoring in biology, shares Crone's view and doesn't mind sharing the campus with the gator as long as it stays off-land.

He first saw the alligator in the pond located between Primera Casa and the Lakeview Apartments on his way to class in November. 

"It was just chilling on the grass," Harnarine said. "But when it saw me and my friends, it just jumped in the pond."

There were only four recorded alligator bites last year in Florida, and only one was fatal, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife's website. The last fatality that resulted from an alligator attack occurred May 14, 2006, when Annmarie Campbell, 23, was seized and grabbed by an 11' 5" alligator while she was snorkeling on Juniper Run in the Ocala National Forest.

"If people don't interact with it, it's not going to be problem," Morse said. "The first thing people want to do is feed it. Nothing can be worse for the alligator because then that's when you start breaking down its fear of people and when that happens, we're going to have to destroy the animal."

Students or faculty who encounter any alligator larger than four feet should call the state-wide alligator nuisance program at 1-866-392-4286.

Headline: Former dance group may return to University
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
What do Pitbull and the former FIU hip-hop dance group Lot Six have in common? They both made their last FIU appearance Oct. 19 during the "Carnaval" ceremony during the Student Programming Council's Hispanic Heritage celebrations. However, five former members are organizing the return of a new hip-hop group after Lot Six cut ties from FIU late last year.

The dance group formed in 2004 and performed at tailgate parties in the Lot Six parking lot; the group adopted the lot's name for itself.

Current captain and non-FIU student Kaery Salazar noted that being in the group was a difficult task.

"We had no sponsors, no uniforms or fund raising," Salazar said. "It was very hectic and frustrating work."

The frustration was a result of having to perform for no charge, yet still having to constantly raise money in order to purchase basic materials such as uniforms. Also, not all Lot Six dancers were FIU students.

Problems arose in 2006 because the dancers, including those who were not FIU students, did not like the group's treatment by FIU affiliated organizations. Lot Six felt that their free services were taken for granted and the lack of school pride on behalf of the non-students upset several of the dancers.

The lack of recognition and appreciation were problems that would build up and eventually lead to the group's departure from FIU. Their leaving was an incident that involved Panther Rage and use of profanity in a song. 

Several weeks prior to 2006 Homecoming's Moonlight Madness event, Lot Six had contacted Panther Rage because they wanted to perform - they wanted to develop a dance routine ahead of time. According to Salazar, Panther Rage did not respond with a yes or no. Therefore, the dance team concluded that their services were not going to be needed.

Two weeks prior to Homecoming, Panther Rage notified Lot Six that there was a spot available for them to dance.

"Two weeks is not enough time at all to come up with a new dance routine," Salazar said. "Especially when some of the girls did not even attend FIU. It was impossible to schedule enough practice sessions to develop a new routine."

At "Carnaval," Lot Six danced an edgy routine called the "305" dance. Due to the time constraints placed on them, they decided to perform that same dance routine at Homecoming's Moonlight Madness and decided to use a song fitting to accompany their routine: a Trick Daddy song containing profane language. Freshman Renata Bresciani, who became a Lot Six member in 2006, said that none of the girls were aware of the criteria a song must meet in order to be acceptable at Homecoming.

"They knew our style, they knew what they were getting," Bresciani said. "They never told us specifically what type of song we could or couldn't do."

During a practice session, members of Panther Rage told Lot Six that they could not perform at Homecoming using that song.

A discussion followed, which led to Lot Six not performing at Homecoming. Consequently, the group decided to remove itself from FIU and work under Fahrenheit Productions, a company that provided the dancers with paying jobs. As of press time, a Panther Rage representative was unavailable for comment.

In the months following Lot Six's departure, their fan base demanded that they return to FIU, according to Salazar. This demand has led Salazar, along with four other members from last year to make an attempt to return to FIU.

The new structure of the group will involve FIU students only; Salazar and Jennifer Pinillos will be the only members who are not FIU students. They plan on recruiting girls during the next two months.

When the team returns, it will not be affiliated with Panther Rage - the group asked Campus Life Advisor Hilda Bernard to tell them the requirements necessary to become an official club.

"I told them they needed at least 10 members, officers and official meetings," Bernard said.

If Lot Six returns, it will not be under the same name, but under a new undisclosed name.

"I don't want to give the name away just yet," Bresciani said.

Headline: How to...a humor column: Follow the formula, die a legend
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
In light of recent events concerning a certain fascinating yet over-exposed dead celebrity that I'll refuse to name on account of the coverage (we'll call her Hannah Extol Width), I've come to understand the obvious nature of death: once you die, there's no coming back - unless you're a kick-ass zombie … or Cher. Same thing. 

With that said, there seems to be a formula I've noticed in life that will assure you will be remembered. Sure, you could be a war hero, a father of eight who died rescuing children from a burning orphanage - though it would only get you an extra couple inches added to your obituary. But if you want the kind of coverage that ranges from C-SPAN 2 to ESPN 8, you have to follow the formula.



Change your name



In a world of reality TV where ordinary people are stars, it seems archaic to have a fake name with an accompanying facade. It ups the mystery value, though. Even if you achieve mild celebrity in life, your dual identity instantly becomes a trivia fact worthy of the "fun" category on the right side of the "Jeopardy!" board. For those of us who don't seek fame ­- or fail to see the thrill of having Alex Trebek whisper your name, as I do - the added advantage of a pseudonym is to at least have another option for your tombstone.



Rile the conservatives



Whether it's a small group of your community's churchgoers or the John Birch Society, sticking it to right-wing conservatives will always get you talked about. They're an uppity and vocal bunch. All Elvis had to do was shake his hips and the nation was in an uproar. However, you may want to avoid certain conservatives, unless you want a premature death. I heard about a heckler approaching Ann Coulter at a book signing and before he could say three words she shoved a Sharpie up his nose. He still sneezes permanent ink.



Document your downfall



If you want to be remembered, you need to leave a lot of stuff behind to be remembered by. Make many public appearances and bring along a camera. The more you can control the two-second stock footage of you that will be played over and over on any or all of the 24-hour news networks, the better. If you don't make it big, you'll at least have footage your family members can play in slow motion during your funeral with a background of some sad Boyz II Men song. 

At my funeral, I'm going to make it a point to play Queen's "Another one bites the dust." Not only is it fitting, if I get the reaction of stifled laughter, it would do my memory justice.



The Tragic End



While I don't recommend it, the easiest and most enduring way to be remembered is to have an odd or tragic death. Fitting example: that Greek playwright Aeschylus from 458 B.C. who was killed when a bird dropped a giant tortoise on his head because it mistook his shiny bald spot for a stone. Normally, I'd write a joke here but I don't think there's a need.

For some, after you die, the only way to prove you existed in the first place is to have your memory continue. In a strange way, that almost encourages the person to get the most out of life ­­- even if it is warped and condemnable to others. If it helps, write your own eulogy and use it as a goal. A posthumous retrospective to-do list, if you will. If you're lucky, keeping a big perspective will help you stay focused and in control. Because despite the massive news coverage, a story as sad as Vicky Lynn Hogan's will never be an exciting game show clue. Good Luck.

Headline: Graphic Violence: 300 combines graphic novel elements, Spartan style ~ Interview with Gerard Butler
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Director Zack Snyder and actors Gerard Butler and Rodrigo Santoro sat down with college reporters at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California for roundtable interviews to discuss the upcoming battle flick 300. 

The movie, opening in theaters on March 9, is adapted from Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name and retells the Battle of Thermopylae, where Spartan and Persian forces dueled. Spartan King Leonidas (Butler) leads a contingent of 300 men against the massive army of Persian King Xerxes (Santoro) in an attempt to deter the Persian Invaders. 


Q: Tell us the training you had to go through for this role to get your body in shape.



I guess nobody told you that's a body suit. [Laughs] Well, I didn't drink this f-----g thing, that's for sure (points at coke). Basically, the day I got the film, I stopped smoking two days later. I started training, just doing my own thing. I, first of all, went to my own gym. We were in the gym two hours a day, pumping weights, running and training, rowing. But then, we brought on the film trainer Mark Twight, who trains undercover operatives, caged fighters and all that. He's an intense guy, so he's like, 'Let's get the cowbell and run and bang your head against the wall six times.' You were almost dead by the end of the clip. I could tell almost immediately it wasn't going to give me the body I was looking for because nobody else in this film had to wear a six-foot beard that was like a lethal weapon in itself and have a helmet with a chicken on it. I knew that I had to have a body that matched my head and I also wanted to feel like a f-----g king, in command of 300 people. This is the one area where I disagree with Zack Snyder because Zack said, 'They would be more scrawny and sinewy but still look muscular and not eat a lot.' And I figured, audiences don't have a thing for that - you still want to see that you're standing off against a million people and you go, 'Wow, look at that. I wouldn't want to mess with that.' And that was also mentally the state that I wanted to get to, and I did. In the middle of the film, maybe I couldn't have kicked a single person's ass, but I felt like I could kick everybody's ass and I felt like I wanted to as well.



Q: The role is very strong and Spartan-like, but there was some room for humanity with your family. How did you balance the two sides?



I think you choose your moments. You trust that what can be shown in one glimpse - even the raising of an eyebrow at a certain point can say so much about a person. I think it was a genius idea to have the king listen to his wife, to look to my wife before I kill the messenger. It shows so much about the relationship and the respect and love he has for her. He really values her wisdom. More is said in this film about those kind of things with silence, such as when he leaves his wife [for battle]. When he was looking at the queen and he's taking in her whole face, nothing is said but you know that he is looking at her for the last time; he loves so much about this woman, but it would never be said and it makes it more powerful as he walks away. 



This is one of the things that make this film different. Those emotions that it brings out, you have to find them because it doesn't show you them as much. These guys are the toughest heroes you would ever come across. They don't apologize to the audience. There is nothing like the commitment, the strength, and the love we will show each other and appreciate the power of what that means. The power of 300 people with a focused intention makes them like 30,000 more. You choose your moments for that to come out. That's the challenge in a film like this. I wanted this guy to come across as an 'uber-male' - intense and controlled. I wanted to show that these 300 men would follow this guy to their death gladly. To get that intensity and insanity but then the humanity and the humor, to get all of those things and suck it right in and really not show any of those things was the challenge.





Q: I've seen some of the video diaries that show the early stages in filming and you guys are walking around in loin clothes in front of a blue screen. How were you able to maintain your faith that the image would turn out in the way it does as opposed to what you're seeing in front of you?



That's a good question - I didn't (laughs). There is an element of putting these costumes on and going, 'Haha, look at you.' We had to laugh at ourselves to get over all that. It's another reason for training your balls off and making sure that you are so focused that that goes out of your mind. Also, you're surrounded by so many guys wearing the same thing - a couple of days and that feeling is gone. Then it becomes. "I'm so glad I'm wearing this." - I felt alive. It was so incredible to have that support because you use that and let it come out in a way that you feel that your focus could blow away a million people.



Q: Zack Snyder (director) was talking about your first meeting with him in the coffeeshop. What were your impressions of that meeting?



Zack can be described to me by my agent as a really nice guy but a film geek. I expected to meet a really geeky guy, but then I met this cool athletic guy with tattoos down his arms - his forearms were whiter than my car. He had all his stuff prepared, and I loved that he would spend his time showing me. Of course, my paranoia was that he was going through the motions, but we had such fun together and we were both so expressive that I just knew who Leonidas was and I knew that I could abandon myself to that. We just had a blast and I went away there going, 'Now, that couldn't have gone as good as I thought it was. He's just obviously the nicest guy in the world.' Then I heard, 'He really likes you.' To me, this feels very destined for me to meet Zack. There was a certain point in my career when I was going, 'I'm not doing this kind of film anymore.' Then, seeing this, I said, 'Okay, I can give all of those things that I always wanted to give, pull them together and have a different take on them with a director who's at a similar point.'  It was like a great combining of the two. With what Zack did, it blows me the hell away. I'm still shocked. He really has made it work on every level without seemingly any effort.

Headline: Graphic Violence: 300 combines graphic novel elements, Spartan style ~ Interview with Zack Snyder
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Director Zack Snyder and actors Gerard Butler and Rodrigo Santoro sat down with college reporters at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California for roundtable interviews to discuss the upcoming battle flick 300. 



The movie, opening in theaters on March 9, is adapted from Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name and retells the Battle of Thermopylae, where Spartan and Persian forces dueled. Spartan King Leonidas (Butler) leads a contingent of 300 men against the massive army of Persian King Xerxes (Santoro) in an attempt to deter the Persian Invaders. 



Q: What was your biggest obstacle filming this movie?



The first difficulty was getting the movie made. It's based on a graphic novel. When I first got the book and took it to the studio the first time, there was no script at all. I was convinced that everyone would think it was as cool as I did so I took it and said, 'Look, it's a graphic novel. 

We're going to film this.' And they went, 'Yeah, no, we don't understand that.'



Also when we first talked about the film, they were first making Troy; the appetite was for a movie that was more traditional. But I thought it would be cool not to do that. We went to pretty much every studio and we got a 'no' from everybody. Not a hard 'no,' though. 



Then Dawn of the Dead came along and I felt that 300 had stalled. When I came back from Dawn, the movie hadn't really gone anywhere. We then wrote a script and from there, Warner Bros. started to say, 'This could be cool.' Then I did an Animatic where I basically film the graphic novel and edit it together and Tyler Bates put some cool music together, but the studio still didn't understand. They asked me to do a test shot (a shot that looks like the movie), so we shot one that had fighting to give them an idea and a sense of the movie.



Because we had so much prep, the actual process of making the images what they look like, that part was sort of intuitive. The evolution of that was something that we figured out. It was an exhausting process. We shot the movie in 60 days - it's not a lot of time to shoot a giant war movie. We got the s--t kicked out of us by the schedule. 



Then, the post-process, which has been a year, has been grueling as well. We did more editing and testing on Dawn but the cool thing about 300 is that the movie feels like it's being remade all the time. You see the sequences trickle in and then the whole sequence is done and now it's a different movie than it was a month ago.



Q: In getting this movie made, did Sin City have any effect?



I have to say that the success of Sin City when it came out was probably the thing that helped motivate the studio's decision. I don't know that they saw the exact relationship between the two things, but I think there's a strong relationship between Sin City and Frank [Miller] and 300 and Frank - they're linked very closely. For some reason, I don't think the studio saw the relationship. You would think it would be obvious, but I think they thought, "Sin City is a noir, weird modern comic book movie and 300 is an ancient Greek epic." 



Q: What were some of the departures you made from the source material?



I think that the big thing we did different was that we added a little more story with Gorgo, the queen. The way Frank Miller's graphic novel works is that it's sort of a non-linear experience and he has the benefit of not having that strict linear format that you have in a movie. Not that you have to adhere to that, but we felt that the story was straightforward and wanted to shake it out.



Q: What percentage of the battles was made with real actors?



Our philosophy about the movie in general was 'if you touch it, then it should be real.' I mean, other than a rhino or an elephant. But other than that, all of the fighting is guys fighting guys. There are background guys who are digital guys but they are just there to make it look like there are a lot of guys back there. The actual fighting, though, is just guys versus guys. 



Q: Was there any effort to communicate some sort of social significance in this movie? Like, is there an American marine in a Spartan soldier? It appears that there are reasonable white people versus the barbarian brown people.



That's the way Frank set it up in the book. I think in some ways, it's the opposite of that. It's a fun ride to go on, but to identify with the Spartans; you're kind of missing the point a little bit. The first time you see the Spartans, they're basically deciding to throw their children off a cliff. Then you have the Persian king Xerxes going, 'Let's not fight. Clearly, you're outnumbered.' The Spartan philosophy, though, doesn't allow Leonidas to do that. They're at odds in philosophy. It's not reason versus necessarily barbarism. It's a reasonable offer versus a philosophy that can't accept it.



Q: What influenced you to cast Gerard Butler in the lead role?



I met him at a coffeehouse on Ventura Boulevard [in Los Angeles, Ca.]. I had the book with me because I didn't know what his exposure to 300 would have been. When he showed up, he stomped around the coffee shop acting like Leonidas and doing the hand gestures from the book. I was like, 'Wow, that's pretty awesome.' I left that meeting thinking that he's pretty good. I wasn't sure that he could get as huge as I wanted him to get. He certainly expressed that he would do whatever. When I left, I was pretty sure it was going to be him.



Q: Where did the idea of the narrator character come from?



There are two things about the film that make the narrator necessary. One is that it's the Spartan perspective of the battle of Thermopylae. We wanted to be a purely Spartan perspective. That was what the book that Frank wrote basically is. There's a narrator in Frank's book. Also, I love Frank's prose. I didn't know how to get it in the movie - you couldn't just have somebody just say those things. But if you have a narrator, you can slip those things. 



Q: You mentioned Troy and Sin City. Both of those movies had big names attached to them like Brad Pitt in the first one. Your cast is much more low-key. Tell me about the decision behind doing that.



Gerard is amazing and Rodrigo is awesome, but if you put them in the US Magazine poll of star power, they would not be as high as Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis. But we really felt strong about what the movie was going to be, I didn't want the movie to pop for you because Brad Pitt is in a loincloth.



Also, once we had Gerry, we couldn't have him as the King and Mel Gibson as the captain - it would be weird. But on the other hand, I did want English actors in the movie because I felt that an English accent in this movie is a convention of these sorts of movie so you don't have someone with an American accent say, 'You rode all the way from Sparta…' It's just weird.

Headline: Graphic Violence: 300 combines graphic novel elements, Spartan style ~ Interview with Rodrigo Santoro
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Director Zack Snyder and actors Gerard Butler and Rodrigo Santoro sat down with college reporters at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California for roundtable interviews to discuss the upcoming battle flick 300. 

The movie, opening in theaters on March 9, is adapted from Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name and retells the Battle of Thermopylae, where Spartan and Persian forces dueled. Spartan King Leonidas (Butler) leads a contingent of 300 men against the massive army of Persian King Xerxes (Santoro) in an attempt to deter the Persian Invaders. 





Q: What preparation did you do for a character that is convinced that he is a god?

It was a bit of an ego trip. Starting physically, when I auditioned for this part, I was in Brazil shooting a film where I had to lose around 35 pounds, so I was really skinny. I put myself on tape from Brazil and sent it to the producer of 300, and he and Zack [Snyder] watched it. They said, 'We really liked the tape, but he's too skinny.' And I go, 'I'm shooting this film where I'm this man about to die, so give me some time.' First, I had a strict diet for four months and a lot of workouts and weights in order to play the giant that Zack wanted. Then, I did a lot of research like read the story of Herodotus to get a good sense of what historically happened and who was Xerxes, which is pretty different from Frank Miller's vision. I think it's a great combination that's based on historical fact, but it's also a graphic novel character. I try to portray Xerxes as a god, and Frank Miller's vision is so clear that you just have to bring it to life and try to be that creature - I think he's not even human.

The voice is a deep thunder. Zack told me that he wanted to work with my voice at a lower level because he wanted the movie theater shaking when I moved my mouth. It was a lot of work working on the blue screen - we had to imagine. We had the graphic novel, but once you're there acting, it's just you and blue walls everywhere. A lot of times I was by myself talking to nobody and pretending to talk to [Spartan king Leonidas, played by Gerard Butler]. It's great training for an actor to use every cell in your brain to imagine and be there in that moment, having millions of men behind you when it's just blue.



Q: Your other roles are very different from Xerxes. How was the transition to this powerful role?

I thought this was a great opportunity for me. Especially being Latin, it's very easy for the market to sell you the way you look. When I first saw that figure in the graphic novel, I was literally salivating. It's just very stimulating for an actor to put you in that spot. It's very risky, too. I make my choices based on my instinct. It has to be something that challenges me. I think that this way I'm going to keep learning and growing and that's basically what I feel.



Q: Describe the makeup and costume you had in the movie.

We covered my eyebrows - I didn't have to shave them. I did have to shave my whole body - my head and the whole body. I started waxing - I have a lot of respect for women. I was crying and biting a towel. The next day, I said, 'Give me a razor.' It's such a process. 

They sprayed my whole body with different colors to get that golden look. The piercings were very subtle - 15 to 20 minutes for each one. It's all about you - it's an ego trip. The costume was very tight, but it was all very helpful because all the gold and the chains and the style protect the character's insecurities. Underneath the costume, Xerxes is scared of everything he has to do.



Q: Were you pursuing a role of this type or was it an opportunity that presented itself?

I was already a big fan of Frank Miller, but I didn't know 300 was going to be a movie. When I saw Sin City, a friend of mine showed me the graphic novel and I read it and said, 'This could be a great film.' I watched Dawn of the Dead and then I met Zack and his vibe is the best. It's very important for an actor to have that relationship with the director where he's open to hear anything you have to say about the character. At the same time, he knew exactly what he was doing.



Q: Did you call on your experiences as a model for the feminine qualities of Xerxes?

The feminine aspect of Xerxes - I try to be asexual in a way because he's such a creature. When you see the graphic novel, there's this one bit where he's staring and I saw something there that was very ambiguous. I do believe as human beings we have everything inside us - good and bad. It's interesting when you see a person as much as you can - all the sides. For Xerxes, it was interesting to play him right on the edge. He could be here or there. I thought it was important that he had more qualities and not just be a guy's guy like Leonidas.


Q: What roles are you pursuing in the future?

I try not to create a plan. Life is so big that we can't control everything. Acting was something that I always wanted to be part of, so I'm already so grateful. I do not plan a specific role or a specific project, but as long as it's something interesting that is going to teach me, then it's going to be a great experience. I try to play by ear and follow my instinct. I think it's better this way so you don't get frustrated and you go slowly. It's nice to have dreams but if you stick too much with your ideals, you forget about now. I'm trying to live what's happening right now. When it comes, we'll see where it goes. I hope to have more interesting opportunities like this one. It's hard and very rare, but I'm hopeful.

Headline: Valentine's Day Ball has fights, mohawks ... and Christians
Author: Ever Cruz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Have you ever observed and watched on reality dating shows when the date takes a turn for the worse and the girl turns her head to the side in blatant disappointment while the guy glances over to see if there is any hope in salvaging the date?

Well, friends, I invite you to watch this episode of Ever's Valentine's Day.

I've never ever had one of those romance-filled nights on Valentine's Day; they were always pretty average.  

When I asked my date to go with me to the Valentine's Day Ball held at Biscayne Bay Campus, her immediate response - delivered in a super girly, romantic comedy-type of voice - was, "Wow, maybe we can finally have a slow dance." 

To be honest, I'm not quite John Travolta on the dance floor. Nevertheless, my date wanted her slow dance and I prepared myself to "get down" and "dance the night away."

The pathway to the Wolfe University Ballroom, where they appropriately held the ball, was covered with a red carpet, lined with red roses, red balloons, and a line of students having pictures taken for their free key chains. 

The majority of those in line were girls.   

As we walked into the ballroom, I was dimly lit; from all sides red cupids smiled at hearts on the walls while the tables were sprinkled with artificial rose petals and red Hershey's kisses.

And yet, with all the décor, as we walked into the room there wasn't any music. I noticed my date's head drop in disappointment. She didn't say much for the rest of the night. 

So began the strangest V-day of my life, beginning with a male and female dating auction.

It was odd that everyone seemed to know each other. Everyone was talking and joking with each other and then that uncomfortable feeling crept up, that feeling of you being the stranger.

The Doors' "People Are Strange" started playing inside my head.

The auction began and the only sign of life was a guy with a strawberry-colored mohawk.

Suddenly, the bidding for dates began at $5 with very little interaction from the crowd - that is, until Mr. Mohawk bid $10 and to no one's surprise, won.

Even a stocky campus police officer offered a bid and won a date.

Suddenly, a student in black suspenders caused a bidding war between two female students that whipped the whole crowd into a frenzy.  Other students started donating their money with the bidding war in full gear, donating to one girl and then another. 

The red mohawk guy was ecstatic and yelled out victoriously, "This money is for a great cause; it will go to the Kingdom!"

The Kingdom? What does that mean? 

I let the thought drift away as I continued watching the activities play out, my date not really responsive at this point.

It came down to two girls, battling back and forth, standing parallel to each other and staring each other in the face.  

Finally, one of the young women yelled out, "I bid $350!"

The other girl, like a resigned warrior in a battle turned around and headed back to her seat.

My date was still quiet.  She hadn't eaten since early afternoon so we could have a "romantic dinner".

I was desperate; I needed to do something, anything.  So I did what any guilty man on Valentine's Day would do: brought her some chocolate chip cookies.  

As the auction and dance came to a close, I had decided I could not leave until I had figured out what the student with the mohawk had meant.

The "Kingdom" referred to the auction's organizers, the IMPACT Movement, an on-campus  Christian organization.

St. Valentine, it seems, had another surprise up his sleeve, which took place on my last stop before I left the ball.

I stopped by the little boys' room and met a fellow student as I was leaving.

The student began a quick but detailed sermon on sins, Jesus Christ and faith.

At the end, he asked me for my final answer: Do I want to be saved? 

As for my date, she said she had a great time. Unfortunately for her, I didn't get to show off my John Travolta dance moves.

Headline: Future of journalism internships hazy
Author: Pedro G. Cortes / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Several newspapers, including the L.A. Times and Boston Globe, have either reduced or eliminated their internship programs due to declining budgets, according to an article posted on Poynter Online Jan. 21.  

However, Alan Richards, chairperson of FIU's School of Journalism and Mass Communications, said students in the school are not likely to be affected by this decline due to high demand for experienced Hispanic journalists in the field.  

Instead seeing an increase in the demand for FIU interns in the state of Florida

"Newspapers in Orlando, Ft. Myers and St. Petersburg are starting to take notice of our students," Richards said.

In the Poynter article "Tighter Budgets Slashing Internships," reporter Leann Frola takes various examples from the professional work force to show statistics.

The McClatchy Company, which owns 32 daily newspapers in 30 U.S. markets, cited a decrease in national advertisers, and as a result has begun a dramatic decrease in its hiring.

"We're in a transitional era," said Howard Weaver, vice-president of news for McClatchy, in the article.

"And we have to find out what that transition means."

Students in internships are also now paid less for their work.

Instead of eliminating their programs completely, several newspapers have scaled them back and decreased the pay, sometimes using college credit as an alternative form of compensation.

Other papers have turned to alternative methods to fund their interns, such as The Oregonian, which has had to receive outside assistance from three separate private organizations in order to keep three interns in their program.

FIU has had a long-standing connection with The Miami Herald, which gives students reporting experience before they'd have the chance to be hired.

Marika Lynch is suburban editor for the Neighbors section of The Miami Herald and is also in charge of its year-round FIU internships.

Lynch assured that her newspaper has no plans to decrease the amount of its interns or their pay.

"The Miami Herald is going to maintain its level of summer interns, who work for the metro, business and features sections," Lynch said in an e-mail. 

Ernest Sotomayor, Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism Director of Career Services, said in Poynter's article that this would not be a long-term trend.

"Employment at newspapers is not going [anywhere]," he said.

Lynch suspected that many of these positions will come back eventually because the industry is "cyclical and will expand eventually."

That shift has already made itself apparent in the form of multi-tasking on the Internet. 

The growing presence of the Internet has lead to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer to open up an online journalism slot in their internship program.

This has also lead to two positions opening up for entry-level employees to work online and multimedia at the Herald, according to Lynch.

This shift into the realm of the Internet has lead several schools, including FIU, to adapt their programs to give students online experience.

Schools such as Columbia have started to train their students in multimedia news reporting.

However, according to Richards, FIU has also been ahead of the game. Richards has taught the Online News Reporting class at FIU since 2002.

He also has his students prepare a different project every semester, forcing them to integrate print, video and online content.

"We've consistently been ahead of the industry when it comes to online content," said Richards.
