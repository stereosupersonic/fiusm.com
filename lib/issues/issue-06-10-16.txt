Headline: First football experience as violent as 'futbol'
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
A fist flew threw the air, then another one and soon enough, both teams were off the sidelines and on the field kicking, punching and even biting, as I'd later hear.

The frenzy soon reached the stands as fans of the home team clawed through the bleachers to get at those wearing the opposing colors, even slamming those who were trying their best to escape the chaos.

That was a night I'll never forget: my first futbol (soccer) game when I was 6-years-old in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Though I've been living in the United States for 15 years, I've never been able to find the level of excitement or passion in American sports that I find in soccer. I've watched a few football games on television and stopped by basketball or volleyball matches in high school to cheer for friends, but I've never had any incentive to attend a big local or college sporting event.

So I wasn't expecting much when I decided to go to the highly anticipated and over-hyped football match between FIU and the University of Miami Oct. 14.

Though I know absolutely nothing about the game foreigners call 'American football,' I stepped into the Orange Bowl hoping FIU would come out victorious, all the while sneering at friends decked out in UM colors for their lack of faith.

The game began as I expected - nothing happened. Some players moved, they stopped, switched players, huddled, then moved again, then stopped and so forth. I spent more time observing the pockets of blue among the sea of orange and green in the bleachers than paying attention to the action on the field.

That is, until the fight broke out. Since football is a contact heavy sport, I didn't know a struggle had begun until players on the sidelines started pouring onto the field. Fans went into uproar, my friends gasped and a string of camera flashes burst from the bleachers.

"I don't know who started it, since it happened all at once," said freshman Barrett Edri, the only student sporting FIU colors in a section dominated by UM fans. "I thought it was unexpected but still fun to watch."

I looked at the scuffle below me, but only with minor surprise. Unexpected? Don't all sports involve some sort of fight?

Apparently not. Moments after the struggle, FIU coach Don Strock shook hands with UM's coach Larry Coker as though apologizing for his team's conduct. Strock even seemed teary-eyed at the post-game press conference, speaking his words rather softly.

A mistake had been made and everyone understood that, an assessment that shocked me more than the fight.

If this had happened in Argentina, the coaches themselves would've probably leapt into the action if they had the chance. A mention may have been made in the news, but if no deaths were reported, everyone would have just counted it off as another silly sports brawl and moved on to the next game (or brawl).

That was a night I'll never forget: my first football game when I was 21-years-old in the Orange Bowl, Miami.

The rest of the game may eventually fade from my memory (including, hopefully, our crushing defeat), but I'm sure the fight and the civilized reaction that followed will not.

Headline: Students feel unity despite game marred by violence

&nbsp;
The Hurricanes may have shut out the Golden Panthers 35-0 during the anticipated football match Oct. 14, but the most memorable moment of the night was the five minute on-field brawl that cleared both teams' benches and resulted in 31 suspensions and multiple crowd fights.

During the seven-minute stoppage in play after the brawl broke out, FIU students stood by their team and showed a surge of school spirit, chanting "FIU, FIU, FIU" while refusing to be drowned out in a stadium covered in orange and green jerseys.

Much of the student reactions to the brawl were in support of the Golden Panthers.

Junior Steven Fernandez was cheering on the teams with friends when the fight broke out.

"The atmosphere was electric and emotions were running high," Fernandez said. "There was a lot of tension between the schools and the audience during the fight."

Students such as junior John Mendez also thought that the brawl made the game a more interesting experience.  

"When the fight broke out, it was like a party broke out in the stands," Mendez said.  "FIU and UM fans yelled at each other. In fact, I barely watched the game after the fight. I was losing my voice cheering."

Mendez stated that the fight brought the entire student body of FIU together in support of their team, something he had never witnessed during his time at the University.

"The FIU spirit seems to have increased after the fight," Mendez said. "The fans definitely got a lot more into it after the brawl. However, it's a shame that something like that had to happen for FIU fans to show school spirit."

Freshman Vignesh Doraiswamy was disappointed that the press spoke in favor of the Hurricanes and blamed the melee on FIU.

"The press is obviously biased towards UM because it's a much more older team that is synonymous with Miami as compared to us," Doraiswamy said. "They say that FIU started the fight but it was actually sparked by [UM player James Bryant] pointing at the FIU bench and mocking the team.

"It was embarrassing for a team like UM to pick a fight with a 5-year-old," said Doraiswamy, in reference to FIU's 5-year-old program. 

The players weren't the only ones throwing fists, helmets and crutches at each other as the agitated audience took their anger out on each other.

Sophomore Jephren Perez was a witness to one of the incidents where an FIU and UM fan started throwing punches.

"It happened shortly after the brawl," Perez said. "Two fans started shoving each other and throwing punches. The cops tried to break things up but the FIU fan started swinging at the cops. When they couldn't cuff him, they tased him. The cops started waving the taser around, warning the crowd after that. It was unbelievable."

Videos and pictures of the brawl have sprung up all across the web from sports and news sites to social sites such as YouTube.com and Facebook.com.

"It's proof that the FIU spirit has actually increased because of the game. I can't wait for next year's game," Doraiswamy said.

Headline: KNOCKED OUT: Brawl overshadows FIU's 35-0 loss to UM
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
What a way to start a rivalry, if it continues at all.

Fans and students anticipated the FIU (0-7) and University of Miami (4-2) game since it was first scheduled. But no one anticipated what took place in third quarter with 9 minutes left in the game.

Following an extra point attempt off a 5-yard touchdown catch by UM junior fullback James Bryant that put UM ahead 14-0 in the third quarter, a brawl broke out in which both sidelines stormed the field.

Prior to the skirmish, Bryant was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct when he took a bow towards FIU fans sitting behind the west endzone. FIU players didn't take well to Bryant's celebration as few words were exchanged between both teams.

Then everything got out of control after the PAT when FIU junior free safety Marshall McDuffie Jr. threw a punch at one of UM's offensive lineman and FIU senior corner back Chris Smith slammed UM holder Matt Perrelli to ground and punched him in the chin.

What ensued shocked everyone. Both benches cleared as players stomped, kicked and flipped one another. At one point, sophomore running back A'mod Ned - who is out with a knee injury - rushed to the field on crutches to take part in the action as well. On the video replay of the fight, UM sophomore safety Anthony Reddick is seen smacking an FIU player with his helmet while an unidentified FIU player is suplexed by a UM player.

It took 15 minutes before coaches and officials got things under control.

"It was a good football game up until that point," said Golden Panthers coach Don Strock. "I don't have any idea how it started. It should have never happened and none of our players should have been involved. "

Both teams said nobody knew exactly what started the fight but admitted that both sides were doing a lot of talking and accused each other a taking cheap shots. 

"We're shocked. Nobody in the locker room has ever been a part of anything like that," FIU sophomore running back Julian Reams said. "If the NCAA reviews the tape, they'll see what was going on. Their whole bench cleared the sidelines and our starters get kicked out and [only a few] of their people get kicked out."

However, UM junior linebacker Jon Beason - like many of his teammates - felt the blame rested on the Panthers.

"Why are we going to get thrown out against FIU? FIU doesn't mean nothing to us on our schedule. If somebody gets suspended for that over this game, it's ridiculous because it was clearly out of hand from the very first play of the game," Beason said.

"This is their national championship - to us, it's just another game on the schedule. From the very beginning, they're throwing punches, late hits, their type of stuff, trying to get us out of our game. I got punched in the face; I didn't punch the guy back because I want to play against Duke, I want to play against Georgia Tech," he added.

Police officers and security surrounded the field in order to keep fans from spilling out into the field. A few fan skirmishes broke out on the bleachers, though.

In the end, 13 players were ejected from the game.

As a result of the bench clearing brawl, 31 players from both teams were suspended - 18 from FIU and 13 from UM. Players that were suspended must sit out their team's next game.

ACC and UM officials suspended Carlos Armour, Chris Barney, James Bryant, Tyrone Byrd, DajLeon Farr, Ryan Hill, Bruce Johnson, Charlie Jones, Brandon Meriweather, Brian Monroe, Derrick Morse, Randy Phillips and Anthony Reddick

Sun Belt and FIU officials suspended Michael Alls, Scott Bryant, Roland Clark, Michael Dominquez, John Ellis, Cory Fleming, Reginald Jones, Marshall McDuffie Jr., Robert Mitchell, Quintin Newman, Luis Pena, Jarvis Penerton, Julian Reams, Lionell Singleton, Chris Smith, Samuel Smith, Mannie Wellington and Chandler Williams.

According to a report in the Associated Press Oct. 15, school officials stated that more sanctions are possible.

Sun-Belt and Atlantic Coastal Conference officials will review the tape of the fight before any additional suspensions or punishments are handed out. Officials from both FIU and UM condemned what occurred on the field Saturday night and apologized to each other.

"[The University of Miami was] gracious enough to grant us these games. They didn't have to and this is how we repay them. I don't care whose fault it is. At FIU, we don't condone this kind of behavior," incoming athletic director Pete Garcia said following the game.

What got lost in the punches, kicks, jabs, suplexes and flags that were thrown was the fact the Golden Panthers were shut out in a 35-0 loss to the Hurricanes in front of 51,130 spectators at the Orange Bowl. 

Up until the brawl, FIU kept the game close, only down by 14.

"They didn't do anything spectacular. We moved the ball on them better than we did on anyone all year. When the brawl happened in the game, a lot of our starters and a lot of people we count on to make plays came out of the game. That slowed down our offense," sophomore center Xavier Shannon said. His father, Randy Shannon, is the defensive coordinator for UM.

At halftime, the game was well within reach. The defense dominated during the first quarter, only allowing UM to compile 109-yards of total offense, 66 of which came on the ground.

Coming into the game, FIU was ranked first in the nation in tackles for losses (9.6 per game). They continued that dominant trend by compiling eight tackles for loss and sacking UM junior quarterback Kyle Wright two times. They also managed to hold UM freshman running back Javarris James under 100-yards. James was coming off two spectacular 100-yard rushing performances. 

Although the offensive line was going up against one of the top defenses in the country,  they gave senior quarterback Josh Padrick enough time to make his reads, protecting him while only giving up three sacks.

The Golden Panthers almost struck first as they moved the ball down field with ease. On third and five, Padrick threw a pass intended for Williams only to have it intercepted by UM sophomore safety Kenny Philips.

Although players condemned what took place that night, they understood why some of their teammates stormed the field. 

"We're a team, we're a family. They're a team, they're a family," Beason said.

Pending any changes, the teams are expected to meet again next year on Oct. 6.

Subheadline: A helping hand in abstinence
Author: Jonathan Cameron / Senior / English
&nbsp;
I want to thank Crisnatha Derosier for her bold article, "Is abstinence dead?" 

I believe this is an issue of great significance that isn't brought up enough. You are not alone in saving yourself for "the one," and I know many students at FIU who share your conviction.

While the media and our culture pressure young people into "hooking up," they fail to mention the consequences that result from having sex before marriage.

Will we be able to tell our future wife/husband, "I am giving you my whole heart," or will it be, "I am giving you what is left of my heart, whatever I didn't give away to X, Y and Z?" 

It is a matter of making the decision beforehand to avoid those situations. It's actually liberating to know that you've given yourself permission to save yourself for marriage, and it will save you and your future spouse from plenty of baggage and unwanted memories.   

As Crisnatha mentioned, the heart of this issue is love with commitment.

There's something very special about keeping sex for marriage, and sharing that with one person.

Of course, remaining abstinent is hard! But know that you are not alone in the struggle.

Subheadline: Poor service a matter of money
Author: Joe Vazquez / Senior / Political Science ~ International Relations 
&nbsp;
Like all students, I've also experienced many of the same problems with the [University's] services, but I do have a few qualms with [Shaw Sprockett's "FIU bureaucracy frustrates students"].

The statement that money is not important and that it is the rude clerks that are the problem is seriously marginalizing the issue of money. 

Why these clerks are rude is probably the best question to be asking and the answer is money. These workers are underpaid and overworked.

They are in this situation because the University - while increasing substantially in student population by about 10,000 - refuses to increase its hiring of employees.

Ask any student who has been here for at least four years and they will probably agree. 

The issue over "extravagant building projects" is not approached from the right angle. Building funds are totally separate from student service funds. Termed PICO funds, they are given to the University only for building.

However, this building boom is due to the extravagant addition of schools and programs to FIU.

Two of these programs include the College of Law and the College of Medicine. These programs are great, but to spend money and time with these types of ventures is limiting the ability of the administration to administer the University.

Not two years had passed since the beginning of the College of Law that attention was redirected to the College of Medicine. All this happened, and yet no visible attention was given to improving the infrastructure of the University. 

Furthermore, while these additional programs may bring prestige to the University, they are limiting the funding of existing programs and student services. 

It is irresponsible to build a city without first building its infrastructure.

Just remember: slow and steady wins the race, and bigger is not always better.

Headline: Black awards give due recognition
Author: Richard Boadu / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The 2nd annual Black Movie Awards will take place Oct. 18, 2006 at 10 p.m. on TNT. The first year was such a success that TNT decided to air the awards for a second year.

To be honest, I am a bit torn by the idea of the Black Movie Awards.

They've helped break barriers for talented individuals like Denzel Washington, Jamie Foxx and Halle Berry. However, another part of me doesn't want the awards, because I get tired of the same old argument: "How come you guys can have your own awards, and we can't have ours?" 

To all the Asians, Hispanics, Indians and any other minority races: you can have your own movie awards, and I see that as no problem at all.

When minority races have their own programs, it is not because they are trying to separate themselves from everyone else; it is because mainstream award shows tend to recognize the majority race. Not to say that this is done intentionally, or that other races are not recognized, but sometimes it is not enough.

The purpose behind minority achievement awards is not to complain that minority groups are not recognized, but to get that recognition for themselves. The goal of the Black Movie Awards is exactly that. Blacks feel that more recognition needs to be paid to black entertainers and black movies. To ensure that recognition, we have the Black Movie Awards. 

Plain and simple, there it is: we are not self-segregating. We are simply taking matters into our own hands. Moreover, I am positive that if an actor or actress from another race performed exceptionally well in a predominantly black film, that person would be recognized in the Black Movie Awards, regardless of ethnicity.

Some argue that the Black Movie Awards are no longer necessary, since outstanding black performers already proved that we could win mainstream movie awards like Oscars, and we have been doing so consistently for the past couple of years.

However, the TNT show has other merits. Not only do they recognize the present state of black film, they also recognize its past and its future. I love the recognition given to past black members of the film industry. These people paved the way for the big-name black stars receiving Oscars and being paid over $20 million a film. These people need to receive the recognition they unfortunately did not receive in the past.

Also, the Black Movie Awards give smaller-budget black films and actors' recognition that could later help them become more prominent. Ultimately, the Black Movie Awards aren't needed to validate black success in films, but any recognition we can get would not  hurt us one bit.

Headline: Trans fats sans government
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Trans fats are the latest food that's bad for you, according to studies by researchers at places such as the Harvard School of Medicine and the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. Trans fats not only raise L.D.L. or so-called "bad" cholesterol levels, but they also lower H.D.L. or "good" cholesterol levels. Moreover, because trans fats are man-made rather than naturally-occuring fats, the human body is unable to metabolize them. As a result, they accumulate in arteries. 

A couple of major U.S. cities have taken matters into their own hands by banning the sale of food made with trans fats, which include common cooking ingredients such as partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and most kinds of margarine and shortening.

The New York City Board of Health voted unanimously on Sept. 26 in favor of a proposal to ban trans fats in all food served by the city's more than 20,000 restaurants. 

The Chicago City Council announced it has a similar ban in the works for the Windy City. As well-meaning as these two proposals may be, a ban on trans fats is not the way to go.

The initiative to banish trans fats from the dining table rests on the patronizing assumption that consumers are incapable of making informed decisions for themselves. Because consumers aren't intelligent or responisble enough to care for their own health, the cities of New York and Chicago assume, local governments feel they must step into their constituents' private lives and micro-manage their eating habits for them.

In the past, when other commonly used ingredients have been deemed unhealthy, consumers have been perfectly capable of avoiding them on their own. 

When monosodium glutamate was developed as an additive to enhance the flavor of protein in foods, the Food and Drug Administration declared it safe. Studies throughout the 1980s, however, suggested that MSG posed serious health risks as a potential cause of problems ranging from migraines to nerve damage. In response, restaurants and food manufacturers began posting labels declaring their products MSG-free. Consumers showed a preference for MSG-less foods, and most companies soon removed the ingredient from their products.

Food companies are well-aware of the effect that proper food labelling can have over consumer decisions.  When the FDA suggested in 2002 that it might consider mandatory labelling of trans fat content in foods, restaurants around the country made the switch from trans fats to healthier oils.

The largest company to do so was Wendy's, which has  more than 6,000 restaurants around the country. According to The New York Times, Wendy's recently stopped using partially hydrogenated soybean oil (a trans fat) and replaced it with a corn-soy blend, reducing the trans fat content in a medium order of fries from six grams to only half a gram.  

The FDA has tackled trans fats by requiring that all foods include trans fat content in their nutritional labels. The requirement came into effect Jan. 1, 2006, and all foods should include trans fat content on their labels by 2008.

This measure should provide consumers with enough information to define their eating habits to their preference. Will consumers choose to make intelligent health choices? That's their own problem; but the right to make the choice themselves must remain intact.

Headline: 'EMBARRASSING': Unexpected scuffle starts true cross-town rivalry
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The football game between the Golden Panthers and the Hurricanes Oct. 14 showed all the signs of a heated rivalry with plenty of fights in the stands and an even bigger one on the field, despite the (highly expected) lopsided score.

I knew from the start that there would be a high amount of uncertainty surrounding this game. The University of Miami has struggled on offense this season, enough to think it was feasible that FIU may have had a chance to keep the game close.

Well, many were wrong on that, myself included.

It turns out that all uncertainty was directed toward the brawl that occurred at the nine minute mark.

Incoming FIU athletic director Pete Garcia apologized to UM administrators, FIU and UM fans and said that the type of behavior exhibited will not be condoned.

FIU Coach Don Strock also added that the melee "was embarrassing, to say the least."

On the other hand, I may be one of the few who thinks the scuffle was the perfect way to start a cross-town rivalry.

Though much has been made about the suplex moves and helmeting, none of the players sustained any major injuries.

The fight also shows that these two teams are playing with emotion - hell, even fans were getting into altercations - so there will be no over-looking next year's rematch.

Now, I'm not one to root for violence, destruction and chaos, but you have to remember, we're not in some third-world country in which rooting for the opposing team can literally mean life or death.

However, if this game had ended with no altercations and just a 35-0 final, no one would care about it next year.

But now there's at least one thing to watch for because the fans are riled up.

Still, something did seem out of place to me, specifically the varying responses given by team officials. FIU heads were very apologetic, while UM coach Larry Coker said his team handled the situation "well."

I know these statements and most evidence points to FIU as the main instigators, but the fact that both benches started clearing at the exact same time shows that neither team handled the situation well.

Both sides should have been equally apologetic.

Our team's record is an  unimpressive 0-7.

At this point, regardless of how many games they've kept close, even if they win their last five games, they'll still be a losing team.

And ultimately, wins and losses determine a good team, not how many games they kept close.

With reactions to the fight piling up, it seems as though FIU's winless streak is fueling the image they have of a team that shouldn't be taken seriously.

For example, here's a quote from UM linebacker Jon Beason:

"This ain't no rivalry," Beason told The Beacon. "You can't start a rivalry after one game … This is [FIU's] national championship - to us, it's another game on our schedule."

His words show how opposing players view this year's Golden Panthers - just another team to be brushed away before moving on to bigger and better opponents.

It's pretty easy to over-look a winless team, especially one that may now carry the stigma of a "thug team."

Perhaps FIU incited the brawl as a way to release some of this season's frustrations; perhaps it was all an accident. But a momentous event took place on that field and both teams - whether high-scorers or winless underdogs -  should be able to understand that on that night, a real rivalry was born.

Foundation to educate Miami-Dade, Broward students on the dangers of carbon monoxide  

Janelle's Wishing Well Foundation has teamed up with Miami-Dade and Broward counties' school systems to provide young adults with awareness on the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.

The foundation was started soon after FIU students Tony Perez and Janelle Bertot died of carbon monoxide poisoning in 2005.

Carbon monoxide, which is emitted when fuel is burned, binds to a person's red blood cells and prevents the flow of oxygen to their tissue after it has been inhaled.

Headline: Maidique clarifies grant audit
Author: C. Joel Marino and Betsy Martinez / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
(This is the second part of an interview University President Modesto A. Maidique granted The Beacon. Maidique will answer questions about his contract renewal in the Oct. 19 issue.)



Q: More than a year has passed since the Board of Trustees voted on an $11.5 million settlement with the federal government after the Department of Energy found $50 million in grant money unaccounted for by FIU's Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology. Is the University still making payments?

Initially, they wanted a huge amount of money. By, I think, a rather deft negotiation, we were able to reduce the penalty to about $11.5 [million]. It's important to know what we did wrong. What we did wrong, a lot of people do in their own accounting in their life.

As a matter of fact, I often pay for a lunch and I don't have a receipt, so I don't get reimbursed. I often will buy a book for professional purposes and I don't have a receipt, so I don't get reimbursed.

What we didn't do right is that we didn't properly account for the effort and time that was put into this federal contract, the bookkeeping. So they basically said, "You have all this money that you have spent that you have not properly kept records accounted for, so we're not going to pay you."

In the end of the day, a clerical mistake, a mistake in not keeping good records [was made]. For those reasons, since we didn't do any terrible thing, just keeping bad records, we were able to get them to reduce the amount that we had to pay back to $11.5 million.

Q: Where are we getting the money from?

We were given an authorization from the state to take $200 million to pay salaries, equipment purchased, and what-have-you. The state very generously takes care of that for us and pays us about 2.5 percent.

Now think as though you've got $200 million. [Makes believe he's counting money] Oh! Now, I'll take 2.5 percent. That doesn't sound like a very good deal. So we told the state, "Thank you for your help all these years."

We now have the authority under the Board of Trustee to take that money back. Now when you take money, a couple of hundred million, that would make 2.5 or even 2 percent, it's not that difficult to take that up to 5 percent without taking a lot of risks, a 5 percent return.

If you take a couple of percent returns on $200 million - lets say the average balance is $100 [million] just for argument's sake - you take 2 percent extra on $100 million you've got $2 million more.

We agreed with Health and Human Services, who conducted the investigation, that we'll pay them off for a period of time. They didn't like that, so we went to a bank and borrowed the money and we paid them back. It's being paid by an improved returns on the investments of money that we didn't have control over before, so it doesn't affect students' fees, it doesn't affect education in general fees, it doesn't affect our donors; basically, it's being paid in a novel way.

Q: You mentioned earlier that there had been accounting errors and mistakes. Have new accounting policies been implemented?

It's a completely new system, new processes. The leadership of that center has been completely overhauled. The director of the center is no longer the director, the financial director in no longer the financial director. It has a new name, a new mission, a new direction and it's being tightly watched.

Headline: FIU students rally for Nova janitors
Author: Begoñe Cazalis / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
Bruce Nissen, an FIU Labor Studies professor, rallied alongside local politicians, student activists and religious figures at Davie United Methodist Church in Broward in an effort to help janitors working at Nova Southeastern University obtain the pay increase and medical benefits they've been seeking.

"NSU President Ray Ferrero believes he will get away with repressive and union-busting activities," Nissen said. "Until now, NSU's reaction has been largely different from FIU's response to the same issue last week."

At the rally, NSU custodians, employed by UNICCO, demanded higher wages and medical benefits. Representatives from the Service Employee International Union, which helped the workers unionize, were also present at the Oct. 5 meeting.

UNICCO, a maintenance services firm, recognized the union Oct. 3, after a majority of workers voted in favor. This has been the third acknowledged union by a Florida university in less than a year.

FIU custodians, employed by VISTA, began attending union meetings in the summer with the help of the SEIU. FIU announced the decision to shift to in-house janitorial contracts Sept. 27.

The newly hired custodians will receive higher wages and health care benefits from FIU. They will only be able to keep a union if represented by the American Federation State County and Municipal Employees, which serves the public sector. SEIU works exclusively with private companies and will no longer represent FIU custodians.  

"Unlike FIU's faculty, which also has a union and willingly supports the University's custodial workers, the NSU faculty does not have tenure and is afraid of speaking up and supporting the workers," Nissen said.

According to an e-mail sent by Ferrero Sept. 29, the future of UNICCO employees at NSU remains uncertain. He announced a possible decision to open NSU contracts to other janitorial service companies, and UNICCO will have an opportunity to bid against them.

"Significant consideration will be given to how UNICCO and its employees carry out their obligations to the university during the process," Ferrero said.

UNICCO was in the process of recognizing NSU workers' union by the time the e-mail was sent.

However, NSU janitors may not have it as easy as those at FIU. Nissen said that NSU, as a private university, could claim "private property rights" and suppress communication between students and the union, making it harder for the workers to find student support.

FIU student organizations, such as the Bolivarian Youth and Campus Action Network, who supported unionized custodians at FIU, were also supporting the NSU workers.

"I was moved," said Christian Andrew, CAN representative, who attended the rally. "These workers are taking the very first step towards change by questioning." 

Two weeks ago, CAN members from 12 academic institutions throughout Florida met in the Graham Center conference room at University Park. The meeting was the network's inaugural seminar and included workshops on employment related issues, according to Jonathan Abreu, a member of United Students Against Sweatshops and CAN.

"On Friday night we found out NSU's response to UNICCO's workers," Abreu said. "We decided it was an issue that concerned us, so we started helping the union right away by signing a statement of solidarity." 

Members of CAN drafted the Solidarity Statement during the meeting and about 40 students, including those from FIU, signed it. Representatives of the CAN plan to deliver the statement personally to NSU's president.

Earlier this year, strong pressure by the unions played a factor in getting the University of Miami to grant higher wages and benefits to UNICCO's workers. One of them was Pablo Rodriguez, a former janitor who now works for SEIU organizing other unions.

"I participated in the hunger strike when I worked at UM; now I help others because employees don't have enough information about unions and employers don't want to deal with their responsibilities," Rodriguez said.

Nissen said the FIU organizations involved will continue to support the Nova janitors and landscapers.

"The idealism of these students will make this a better place to live in the future," Nissen said.

Headline: Wall of Wind tested on Sweetwater home
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
Approximately 50 people were 'blown away' watching FIU's Wall of Wind - a simulated hurricane demonstration that tested a house's strength against 120 mile per hour winds. 

The crowd, which included police, reporters and FIU faculty and staff stood on the sidewalk and closed off the street to witness the first Wall of Wind test on a Sweetwater home. 

Consisting of two giant fans stacked on top of each other, the Wall of Wind was strategically placed at an angle in front of the doorway of a former mayor's condemned house, located at 11137 S.W. Third St. in Sweetwater. The Wall of Wind test on the 1950s style home took place Oct. 12 and was expected to generate rain and winds of up to 120 miles per hour.

According to Steve Sauls, vice president of governmental relations, the four-year long project was done so that the International Hurricane Research Center located at FIU could test their methodologies.

"We are trying to promote awareness of some of the consequences of hurricanes so we can develop better, safer homes for our families," Sauls said.

Wall of Wind is part of a $5.9 million proposal the school is making to develop the Center of Excellence in Hurricane Damage Mitigation, which will carry out research to improve construction in South Florida.

Sauls said it was important to perform this test in order to better understand what needs to be done in order to prevent excessive hurricane damage to residential homes.

"This is a way we're going to learn something," he said. "Now, we're going to build better houses."

As the fans began to slowly whir, spectators were instructed to put on their earplugs. When the fans picked up speed, what began as a muffled hum became a headache-inducing roar.

The first visible result of the test blew off shingles, and the rain became visible in the form of a mist floating in front of the house.

The windowpanes to the right of the house shattered.

"Those are hurricane force winds for you," said Stephen Leatherman, chair professor and director of the International Hurricane Research Center, to the attentive audience. 

After 15 minutes, the fans slowly stopped, and the foundation and structure of the house remained intact. 

The damage seemed minimal - at first.

Upon entering the house to survey the interior damage, two gaping holes in the ceiling - one directly above the door and the other to the right of the living room - were visible. Furniture and paraphernalia scattered all over the living room were covered in rainwater.

An inspection of the bathroom and office, located in the back of the house, revealed that the rear windowpanes had also been shattered. The master bedroom was littered with debris. 

"There would have been more damage if the fans had stayed on longer," Leatherman said. 

Although its creators say this Wall of Wind model is just the beginning, the make-believe hurricane provided valuable insight on the wrath of a storm.

"It's just something that's the first of its kind and research and ideas will lead to a lot of improvement in buildings," said Jimmy Erwin, a graduate student at FIU who helped with the project.

Headline: Review: The Killers - Sam's Town (Music)
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
The success of The Killers' 2004 debut, Hot Fuss, was largely symptomatic of a music industry desperate to latch onto the next big thing and shamelessly eager to capitalize on the promise of the so-called new wave revival. Propelled by the dubious merit of an album composed of handful of brilliant singles scattered among a pile of uninteresting tracks, The Killers rode their way to stardom on a wave of hype and glitter. 

No one can begrudge the band recognition for producing catchy gems like "Mr. Brightside" and "Somebody Told Me," but a couple of smash singles usually make for one-hit wonders rather than five Grammy nominations. 

Such acclaim, arguably undeserved for a fledgling band with only one album on the shelves to show for its experience, is sure to exert pressure on even veteran artists, let alone a quartet of giddy kids from Las Vegas. 

 The Killers had a lot to prove on their sophomore album: they had to show the world that they had just as much substance as style, that they were here to stay.

Sam's Town is the product of such expectations. Where Hot Fuss was all shine and bright lights, Sam's Town is an attempt to grow up too quickly. 

They've traded in their eyeliner for beards and began name-dropping Springsteen more often than New Order. In the process, however, they end up sounding pompous rather than serious. 

On Sam's Town, vocalist Brandon Flowers tries his hand at appealing to the common man by tapping into the universal themes of working-class America. The result is a mess of distant, inaccessible lyrics: generic and altogether devoid of meaning. The title track offers a particularly atrocious example: "I still remember Grandma Dixie's wake/ I never really known anybody to die before/ red, white and blue upon a birthday cake/

and my brother, he was born on the fourth of the July... and that's all."

Sam's Town does not suffer so much from bad songwriting as it does from its attempt to be all things to all people. The title track, again, is a perfect example of this. Left alone, it could have been a perfectly good, gloriously infectious pop song. However, they manage to ruin it by tacking on an incongruously dramatic conclusion, complete with string arrangements and an anthem-like chorus of voices. It then inexplicably segues into about 15 seconds of circus music and ends suddenly.

To be fair, Sam's Town does have its share of catchy melodies and perfect pop songs. The album's third track, "When You Were Young," is a flawless single. 

By far the best song on the album, the song combines the perfect amount of instruments and layers, and it adds detail with bursts of synthesizer.

  The song is driven by guitar riffs pilfered right off "Born to Run," and Flowers drops his voice down to come as near as he can to matching Sprinsteen's. As close as it comes to a shameless rip-off, though, "When You Were Young" just manages to tread the boundary that separates hero worship from copyright infringement. 

Past the third track, the album turns sharply downward, with most tracks fusing together in a jumble of melodies unsure of where they are going, chord progressions driving forward in no particular direction and instrumental layers that don't know how they got there. 

Aside from scarce redeeming moments in tracks like "Bling (Confessions of a King)" and "Read My Mind," where the band stops trying so hard and makes good, uncomplicated songs, Sam's Town is hardly worth any but the most die-hard fans' time and money.

Headline: Review: Yeah Yeah Yeahs (Concert)
Author: Reinier Hernandez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
New York rock trio Yeah Yeah Yeahs took the stage at Pompano Beach's Club Cinema on Thursday, Oct. 12 and it was a pleasure to both eyes and ears.

Before the headliners took the stage, however, the band's opening act Deer Hunter was literally painful to watch or hear. The seemingly emaciated lead singer, Bradford Cox must have noticed several audience members, including myself, covering their ears during their set. In what seemed to be retaliation, the band responded with extremely loud feedback from their instruments that didn't do much to cool the audience's feelings toward them. Cox uttered the cringe-inducing proclamation "Joey Ramone and I have the same disease. It's called heartbreak!" before the band took their bows and made way for the main attraction. The only thing Cox seemed to be suffering from was tone deafness and possibly anorexia.

 Yeah Yeah Yeahs made their appearance soon after to an audience that was for the most part polite, if not just a little foul smelling from the heavy cigarette smoke in the air. Only once did the crowd lapse into chaos, eventually leading to my companions and I being drenched in beer, but in the heat of the moment all was forgotten and attention shifted back to the band.

The opening song to their set was the fast paced single "Gold Lion" from their latest record. Things didn't slow down for quite a while with one fast song after another until the band took a break to greet several family members in attendance and then played their biggest hit to date: the ballad "Maps," which was performed beautifully in a very dream-like, almost lullaby-style manner, complete with audience swaying and the concert staple of raised cigarette lighters. Thankfully, most of their fast numbers are relatively short to allow some of the more out-of-shape fans, like myself, a moment to breathe.

The set list consisted of several new songs with a smattering of tracks from their debut album as well, each played with finesse and energy, especially on the part of lead singer Karen O who was in top form. Her trademark bizarre fashion sense and on-stage antics were in full force while she danced over the length of the stage and often created a fountain of water or beer with her mouth to excite the fans. There were also several instances throughout where O stopped mid-lyric to laugh or giggle, but it was easily forgiven due to an otherwise flawless delivery and the fact that she looked so darn cute doing it.

 Overall, while the show was relatively short even after a brief encore, it was a perfect example of what a concert should be: a mix of both great performances and a generally good audience.

Subheadline: Techniques to easily pull yourself out of a rut
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Sometimes, immersing yourself into too many activities can make you feel like you're driving home from a club at 4 a.m. - you're going too fast, and everything is blurrier than it's supposed to be. The constant college demand to work hard and play harder has the side effect of feeling listless or like you're in some pretentious indie film where it takes three hours for a plot to develop and in the end, no one learns any lessons.

I feel as though I've slipped into a "fat Elvis" period. It's where you're eating/drinking/sleeping too much to avoid stress. Plus, you have an insatiable desire for peanut butter and banana sandwiches.

Given that the average college schedule is packed like the under-ventilated bus to the Biscayne Bay Campus, there are some small things you can do to get yourself out of a rut and back in the saddle.


I just need "me" time

In order to not go completely crazy, one needs time alone to reflect, if not mentally prepare, for the next week of insanity. Try to set up at least an hour each week where you just find something that you really like to do, even if it's frivolous, and do it. Every generation has its version: old people feed ducks in parks, the middle-aged pretend they enjoy opera and 13-year-old boys have "private time" with posters of Carmen Electra.

Even childish things like drawing or playing on a swing set can help you - if only for a short while - to regain some of the simplicity of kindergarten. Personally, I eat paste.

In any case, you have to make a date for yourself and stick to it, even if it happens to be on a Saturday night during the party of the century. That way, you feel more wanted when your best buddy drunk dials you, leaving you an eight-minute message of "Bro, where are you? This party is insane, yo! No, I'm not talking too loud! God, I miss my ex-girlfriend, do you think she'll mind if I sneak in through her window?"



Don't hate, meditate



Some people call it prayer; other people call it listening to the voices. Either way, meditation is a great tool to recharge. Studies say that it actually helps in reducing stress, and statistics show that the number of love-bead wearing creepy guys doing it has declined exponentially.

 Be warned, meditation is not to be used in combination with any other activity. Emptying your mind and driving, for example, is not a good combo. Although, emptying your mind while listening to your partner whine about crap you don't care about may be a worthwhile experiment. Just wear sunglasses to avoid them catching on when your eyes start rolling to the back of your head.



Self help    



Sometimes when you're feeling overwhelmed, you just have to look at yourself in the mirror and say, "Go get 'em, tiger!" Even the most seemingly structured people need a push to keep going. For instance, I caught my professor looking into a make-up compact before class telling himself, "You're a pretty little girl, aren't you?" It was inspiring.

When feeling like life is repeating endlessly like a broken MP3, you can't revert to the Elvis method of coping ­­- we all know what too much of that can lead to and how the king's story ends. Although, some people do argue that he's alive and well and was just escaping the conventional confines of a normal life. Hmm, then I guess that just makes everything I just said null and void. Good Luck.

Headline: Vigil honors memory of deceased student
Author: Maria Chercoles / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
More than 100 people held white candles, wore white and purple ribbons on their shirts and gathered in silence at the main room in the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house at University Park Oct. 12 afternoon for Derek Jacobs' vigil.

FIU student Derek Jacobs, 18, passed away Sept. 30 when he lost control of his motorcycle, slid along a guardrail and struck a wooden pole on Palmetto Park Road. 

Friends, family and representatives from campus departments and organizations such as the Student Government Association, Campus Life and almost all FIU fraternities and sororities attended the vigil in Jacobs' memory. 

"We are not here to mourn over Derek's death," said Jacobs' roommate Christian Fraga to open the ceremony. "We are here to celebrate his life because most of us can't yet believe he's gone, and for others, he will always live within our hearts."

Jacobs was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, also known as the Fijis, and lived in the fraternity's house for two years.

At age 12, Jacobs was the youngest person to receive Microsoft certification to run a professional computer network. At age 18, after attending FIU for only two years, he was gearing to graduate from FIU's School of Engineering and was considering attending medical school.

The ceremony was continued by a speech from Jacobs' father, Jeffrey.

"Derek was full of life," Jeffrey Jacobs said. "He always wanted to be a superior being, to help others, to teach. If we follow his words, he'll always live within us."

"I remember the first time I met him," said Jacobs' fraternity brother Anthony Pego. "I could not believe he was 16 and a junior. He always lived by five values: friendship, knowledge, service, morality and excellence."

After the speakers, Jacobs' fraternity brothers gave his family an album with more than 50 pictures of Jacobs and his friends as well as letters for him from loved ones.  

The ceremony ended with a slideshow of pictures portraying Jacobs and his friends during their best times together.

Also, along the room, friends set pictures and letters for Jacobs for those present to read. 

"Although it is a tragedy, we will all learn, grow and change after it," said Jacobs' mother Leslie. "He always wanted to touch other people, and this is what I will try to do from now on."

Jacobs received media attention from NBC's "Today Show" for being one of the first people, together with his family, to be inserted with an identification chip that could facilitate access to personal information in case of a medical emergency.

After the Vigil, the silence was broken and Jacobs' friends shared their memories and teachings from Jacobs with his family.

"He was a real genius," said Jacobs' grandfather Marty Jacobs. "I remember one day, when he was only 18 months. We bought a VCR, and we were trying to learn how to use it. Derek grabbed a tape, put it into the VCR's opening and said, 'Mama, push here.' He then grabbed the remote control and pointed at the play button and said, 'Mama, push here.' He has always been like that."

"He was my best friend," Fraga said. "He always encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and I could not have done it without him. We are all going to miss him."

"Now that he left, we can't stop learning new things about him," Marty Jacobs said. "He was so special, we'll never get to know how great he was."

Headline: Miami rapper takes stage at cultural festival
Author: Maria Chercoles / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
The Student Programming Council will close its Hispanic Heritage celebration on Oct. 19 with its 2006 "Carnaval," which will include a live performance by Miami's own Pitbull, among other planned performers and events. "Carnaval" will start at 1 p.m. between the Blue and Gold garages and will last all day.

For more than five years, "Carnaval" has traditionally been the closing ceremony of Hispanic Heritage, a two-week celebration showcasing Hispanic traditions and culture. The planning for Carnaval 2006 began in May, and like previous Carnavals, more than 1000 students are expected to attend.

"We expect it to be an amazing success for SPC and FIU as a whole," said Ayxa Barbel, Hispanic Heritage chair. "I want it to be a fun experience for all the students and a way to celebrate Hispanic Heritage and culture in an eclectic way." 

Besides Pitbull, other featured performers will include Ctraffik & Caliba, the FIU Marching Band, Popstarz, El Diablito, Vikingo, Ralphy Ray from EL Grupo K-Oba, the Lot 6 Dancers and Dynamic Dominicans of Reggaeton. 

However, students agree that the star of the show will be Pitbull.

"I like the fact that his music hits close to home," said senior Krystal Permanan. "He either talks about the people of Miami, the Miami Heat, et cetera. His lyrics are very familiar to me because I know and feel everything he talks about."

Despite the long planning of the event, some of Pitbull's fans don't know yet about his performance at FIU.

"I had no idea he was coming, but I will go for sure," said senior Alfredo Jenks as he animatedly scrolled down all of Pitbull's songs in his laptop. 

According to Barbel, "Carnaval" has been promoted at all Hispanic Heritage events. SPC has sent University-wide e-mails announcing it, and it has also been advertised in the council's website.

"We are relying on word of mouth as our target audience is FIU students," Barbel said.  

There is no official budget for the whole event, which is a collaboration among the SPC Concerts, Cultural Celebrations (Hispanic Heritage), and Campus Entertainment committees. However, it will cost SPC $20,000 to have Pitbull perform at FIU on Oct. 19.

"[Pitbull] was very willing to come to FIU," Barbel said. "He supports colleges greatly, especially in his hometown Miami. He was very cooperative and excited to play here. It was a matter of opportunity and getting an act that a great part of the student body would come out to see."

Past "Carnaval" celebrations included performances by Dominican Latin rhythms quartet Fulanito in 2004, and Miami's fusion group Locos Por Juana in 2005, each performance attracting more than 1000 students.

"2004's 'Carnaval' was great," Barbel said. "I think Fulanito had a wonderful and energetic performance, and it was a lot of fun. Students even stuck around in the rain to see them."

In addition to the live performances, radio station Mega 94.9's street team will be at the event with music and giveaways, and Mega TV Channel 22 will be organizing interactive activities for students through their "Megafono," including a $5,000 scholarship giveaway.

Other activities will include caricature drawings, free food and dance performances. The United States Navy will be there with Xbox live games and giveaways, and artist Kiki Valdes will be painting live on stage as Pitbull performs.

Headline: Alternative Meds
Subheadline: Students find relief in unique practices
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
FIU alumna Dahlia Mohammed agreed to have needles inserted onto her forehead, ears and wrists for 30 minutes to get rid of a headache. She said it went away almost immediately.

"It depends on each individual how effective it is, but it worked for me instantly," Mohammed said.

The procedure Mohammed underwent, known as acupuncture, is one of several forms of alternative healing provided by the Wellness Center at FIU's University Park.

Currently, the Wellness Center has staff that specializes in acupuncture, yoga, massages and chiropractic services.

According to Mariela Gabaroni, Assistant Director of University Health Services, the Wellness Center decided a few years ago that they wanted to set up an identity for themselves, and because the U.S. population was leaning more and more toward alternative therapies, they decided to follow the trend.

"We thought it was definitely a way for us to go," said Gabaroni. "We want to build healthy individuals who can contribute to our community and our society."

Used to cure headaches, stress and addictions, among other things, acupuncture is an ancient Chinese medicine that helps bring the body back into balance as well as maintain that balance. This form of treatment releases endorphins and has no side effects.

Clients who want an acupuncture session at the Wellness Center must have a comprehensive health interview and examination with Janet Waterfields, the resident licensed acupuncturist. 

There, they are diagnosed through two methods. The first is through the examination of the color and coating of the tongue, and the second is through the palpitating of the radial pulse.

 Based on the accumulated information, Waterfields decides what she needs to treat by defining a syndrome or patterns that are involved in one or more meridians. The belief of acupuncture is that the body's energy, or "qi," flows through the body along interrelated channels, or meridians. When this energy flow is disrupted, the body will suffer from emotional and physical illnesses.

"The whole idea with acupuncture is to help the body restore equilibrium," Waterfields said. 

After pinpointing the problem, Waterfields treats the client with single-use sterilized needles that are inserted into certain points of the body; each point has its own action. After the needles are inserted, the client is left alone for half an hour with the needles still in place in order to relax. Then the needles are taken out, and the session is over.

Mohammed said the procedure didn't hurt her.

"It doesn't even pinch or anything," she said.

Waterfields recommends using acupuncture before using a more "invasive procedure" that is common in Western medicine.

Gabaroni said the most popular alternative healing method amongst students is the yoga classes, which are offered at the Fitness Center and taught by yoga instructor Betty Valladares. She teaches a style of yoga called hatha yoga, which tries to balance mind and body through physical exercises, or asanas, as well as through controlled breathing and meditation and relaxation in order to calm the mind.

"The purpose is so you release clutter in your mind. The purpose is to find union in yourself," said Valladares.

Valladares is also the massage therapist at the Wellness Center. The two different types of massages offered are 10-minute chair massages and the 30 minutes to one-hour table massages. Used to promote circulation, massages also help release endorphins.

Creams and lotions, used primarily in table massages, are applied to the client's skin in order to eliminate friction. 

After the massage, the client is instructed to drink a lot of water the rest of the day to eliminate the toxins in their body through their urine or perspiration. 

Valladares said that helping their clients become healthier through a short period of time is the goal of these massages.

"You're trying to bring them to a short point of optimal health," she said.	

    Chiropractic care originates from ancient Chinese and Greek medicine. It involves manipulating the spine to prevent and cure aches and pains. Chiropractic sessions, performed by Dr. James Stieglitz, can also improve flexibility, movement and nerve function.

Gabaroni feels the chiropractic sessions are an essential part of the Wellness Center.

"Everything runs through the spine, and that's why chiropractic [sessions] are a good thing," she said.

Gabaroni said that it is one of the Wellness Center's goals to introduce students to alternative healing methods.

"When it comes to everything, we try to blend Eastern and Western medicines and expose students to all possible options," she said.

These services, which, according to Gabaroni, are made to compliment a client's life at a free or reduced cost. 

"They do help out with a lot of different ailments," she said. "Sometimes, dealing with stress just means focusing on yourself and you needing to figure out how to deal with stress. It's all very personal what therapy you use."

Acupuncture appointments are every Friday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. An initial session for students costs $35, and follow-up sessions cost $25. For faculty and staff, an initial session costs $50, and follow-up sessions cost $35.

Yoga classes meet every Monday from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. and on Wednesdays from 5 to 6:30 p.m. They are free to students, as long as they present their student ID.

Chair massages are free, and the table massages are $30 for 30 minutes. These are performed by appointment.

Chiropractic services are by appointment. The first session is $40, and follow-up sessions are $20. Consultations are free. These services are offered Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

&nbsp;
Humor columnist Dave Barry has won a Pulitzer Prize, been syndicated in over 500 papers and is lead guitarist for a band that includes authors such as Stephen King, Amy Tan and Mitch Albom.

Barry will be speaking at a small event Oct. 18 in the Wolfe University Center in honor of his late father-in-law, Leonard Kaufman, a professor for the School of Engineering. The proceeds for the event will be used for a scholarship in Kaufman's honor.

The performance will be open to the general public. Tickets will go for $5 for all FIU students and $20 for non-students.

However, a $65 admission fee will include participation in a pre-reception with Barry and an autographed copy of his book Money Secrets. For more information on tickets call 305-919-5524.

Barry talked to The Beacon through an e-mail interview about what he expects students will (or will not) learn during the event, memories of his father-in-law and his involvement with FIU.

Q: Mr. Barry, what important topics will you be discussing next Wednesday at FIU?

None of my topics are actually important, although I do have some very strong views, which I usually make up as I go along.

Q: Why is it important that students hear such topics?

I honestly can't think of a reason why students would NEED to hear me discuss topics. But I can promise that there will not be a quiz.

Q: Will you be giving valuable advice to students that day?

If I do, it will be totally by accident.

Q: This lecture will be in memory of your father-in-law, what are your best memories of him?

He was a very, very funny man; he found humor in everything, and loved to laugh. He also loved FIU, especially his students. He was a dedicated, hardworking professor.

Q: Besides this event, what other future involvement do you have planned with FIU?

I'm sure that, through my wife's family, I'll continue to work with FIU on fundraising and other events.

&nbsp;
A new cafeteria will soon be opening at the Biscayne Bay Campus but debate continues as to what will happen to the space occupied by the current cafeteria.

The 10,000 sq. ft. project has a budget of $4 million. It is  is set to be partially completed by March 2007, according to Carlos Aspillaga, the senior project manager.

"The new cafeteria will open at the south end of [Wolfe University Center] and will be overlooking the lake, a beautiful addition," Aspillaga said.

One of the questions students and faculty have is what will happen to the space the current cafeteria holds.

Earlier this year, the Biscayne Bay Campus' Student Government Council hosted an open forum where students had the chance to display their opinions about what to do with the current cafeteria space once the expansion takes place.

 "We have ideas but we need to put them together as a team," said SGC-BBC President Camilo Silva. "We are debating to see what we do with the current cafeteria space. One of the proposals is more offices for student groups because they are all jammed up in Campus Life."

Kenesha Paul, the Campus Life chair, said the right vendors and services are needed. However, the same services currently being offered might not be around when the new cafeteria opens.

"The cafeteria has not been assigned to a vendor. Aramark bid on it but they must give us a good deal to get it," Aspillaga said.

Despite no clear-cut vendor for the new cafeteria, Roger Clegg, the director of operations at BBC's dining services, seemed optimistic about the expansion. 

"I'm excited about the new Wolfe [University] Center expansion and believe that all new facilities will serve to benefit faculty, staff and the student body at BBC," Clegg said.

Aramark - the dining services company that FIU is currently under contract with - "is the leading provider of food and support services to colleges and prep schools … Aramark serves over 200 million meals annually to students, faculty and visitors at over 400 institutions," according to their webpage, www.aramark.com. 

Based out of Philadelphia, the dining service company was voted in Fortune magazine's 2006 list of "America's most admired companies."

Many BBC students are glad that the cafeteria will expand and they hope for more dining options.

"It would be a great idea to expand the cafeteria and maybe bring in some new companies that provide more choices to students," said junior Mike Pina.

In the meantime, though, students will have to stick with the few choices they have: Subway, Grille Works, Home Zone, Grab and Go sandwiches, Salad bar/soup and Bene Pizza. Other options include snacks, sandwiches, sweets, coffees and drinks at Java City on the first floor of Academic I.

SGC-BBC members will meet with Rosa Jones, vice-president of Student Affairs and Undergraduate Education, Oct. 17 to discuss possible proposals for the current cafeteria's future.

Headline: Educator speaks at Convocation
Author: Ana Davis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
David Lawrence Jr., a former publisher for The Miami Herald and current president of the Early Childhood Initiative Foundation, was the main speaker at one of the events of this year's Faculty Convocation at the Biscayne Bay Campus Oct. 10.

Lawrence spoke to faculty, administrators and community guests about early childhood education and change within a diverse community.

The lecture was titled "The past, the present, and the future in Miami - and the Impact of FIU."

Lawrence stressed many important issues to both FIU and the communities where the campuses are located, as well as the impact of the University on the areas around it.

"Is there a bigger success story than that of FIU in Florida over the past decades?" Lawrence said.

"[BBC] is part of the North Miami community. We must enhance communication with the schools in the area," said James Sutton, assistant professor in the English department and chair of the Faculty Convocation Committee.

Lawrence has been a prolific member of the city of Miami since 1989.

The new kindengarden through eigth grade center adjecent to BBC was named after him. 

An advocate for early education, Lawrence helped pass a congressional legislature to offer universal, high quality, pre-K education to all 4-year olds in Miami.

One year later, 106,000 children attended summer care and day care made possible by this program, Lawrence said. 

He is currently working on a program, through the Early Childhood Initiative Foundation, that hopes to "align curriculum and development in pre-K through third grade."

It was Lawrence's opinion that tackling issues affecting early education is necessary for the future of the community.

"In order to make higher education better in the state of Florida, and Miami in particular, it is imperative to begin encouraging the importance of education from early childhood," Lawrence said.

Lawrence also discussed the various accomplishments that have been made at FIU, highlighting the achievements of some FIU alumni including Pulitzer prize winning journalists and those who have gone on to serve in political positions throughout Miami-Dade county.

"FIU should be proud of its accomplishments and eager for those to come," Lawrence said. 

He recognized the University's accomplishments and also stressed that embracing change is something important in order to move forward.

Being in such a diverse community, the future of FIU depends on its ability to change and adjust, according to Lawrence. 

"Progress is always a product of optimism, the future of this community depends on those who welcome change," he said.
