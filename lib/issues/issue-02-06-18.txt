Headline: Wilson turns hobby search into successful run at FIU
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
For Vronique Wilson, a junior sprinter on the Golden Panther track and field squad, it was all about picking up a hobby. 

"I would usually just go home after school, so I was really looking for something to do," Wilson said when explaining her decision to try out for the track team at her high school. 

"My friends kept telling me to come out for the team, that it would be good for me. It wasn't until my junior year that I realized this could be a way for me to get to college, that I could earn a scholarship." 

Wilson, a native of Fort Lauderdale and graduate of Boyd Andersen High School, worked hard "especially in the weight room," and it has paid off. Her dedication earned her an opportunity to showcase her talents at the Outdoor Track & Field Championships in Baton Rouge, La. She placed ninth in preliminary heats and finished ninth in the finals of the women's 200-meter dash in Baton Rouge. 

Wilson was running her first-ever NCAA Championship heat. She crossed the finish line in 23.61 seconds, just one-hundredths of a second behind eighth-place's Kinshasa Davis of USC who recorded a 23.60. 

Wilson is quick to give credit to the people who have helped her achieve success.

"I really have to credit my coach, Jessica Carter. She has been great," Wilson said. 

She also praised Carter's husband, Jonathan, and assistant coach Lloyd Edwards for their dedication to the team. But even with all the help Wilson and her teammates received, the season is always a challenge. 
Wilson's best regular-season time this year was 23.24. It was the 14th fastest time in the country going into the championships. 

The level of competition she was facing was evident when her personal-best time was almost not enough for her to advance. It was not until the end of the 200m competition that Wilson was assured that she was not eliminated. Her time was fifth fastest overall when she crossed the finish line in the second heat. Unfortunately, there were still two heats to go.

Besides the challenges on the field of play, Wilson is quick to point out the difficult tasks student-athletes have trying to balance school and rigorous practices.  

"People may think that being an athlete means you get it easier in the classroom but that's not true. You have to balance your time more. 
"You have to be more responsible. I'm here to get an education too. I care about my grades." 

The season begins with practices in the fall and runs all the way through the end of spring. This leaves little free time to enjoy life away from the track. 

"This is a very long season. It pretty much lasts all year." 

Wilson, an International Business major, has high hopes for next year's team and hopes to equal and surpass her achievements of this season. 

"I see our team improving next year. Unfortunately, we had lots of injuries this year that set us back," she stated. "I would like to win the indoor championships next year. I feel I can still improve. I felt a little disappointed to not have placed higher [in the NCAA championships]. My dad and boyfriend were there. Everyone was telling me at least you got here, but I want to come back and win."

Headline: FIU launches new marketing campaign
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
FIU football launched its ticket marketing campaign on June 5, by asking the program's supporters one question.

Got tickets?

That is the question that will be the focus of the ticket selling campaign, which will run through the summer until the program kicks off its inaugural season by hosting St. Peters on Aug. 29.

People are starting to get excited," head coach Don Strock said. "It's almost football season all around the country."

On this day, FIU showcased its new 14' X 48' billboard design. The design includes a smiling Strock, a black stripe of sunblock under each eye, and the marketing slogan. To celebrate the event, the approximately 300 attending students and staff were given black sunblock for a group photograph.

The campaign will be expanded in the near future to include radio ads on several Miami stations.

"Our fans are in for a treat because FIU is going to play an exciting brand of football," Strock said. "When you combine that with the fact that this is one of those rare opportunities to watch a program develop from its very first game, you have something special. And we believe our students, our alumni and this community will respond to it."

FIU hopes to secure 5,000 season ticket before the season begins. Strock said that he has already received commitments for 1,500 tickets. 

The Golden Panthers will play in the 17,500 seat Community Football Stadium at FIU-University Park.

Schedule Changes

FIU announced changes to its schedule for the upcoming season.
The Golden Panthers game against Bethune-Cookman, at Lockhart Stadium, will begin at 5 p.m.

The home game against Georgetown  has been moved up to 1:00 p.m. The game was originally scheduled for 3:30 p.m.

Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
Five FIU baseball players were selected in the Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft that was conducted two weeks ago in New York.

Senior Brad Eldred was the first Golden Panther to go off the board, being selected with the sixth round's opening pick, No. 63 overall, by the Pittsburgh Pirates. 

Eldred ranked second in the nation and set a Sun Belt record with 29 homeruns.

Junior Ozzie Lugo, who missed the previous season, was drafted in the 13th round by the Anaheim Angels.

Bernard Gozalez and Tommy Dueñas, both seniors, were also taken on the first day of the draft.

Gonzalez hit .323 this season with 10 homeruns and 62 RBI. Dueñas hit .387 with 12 homeruns and 57 RBI.

"I had hoped to be picked in the top five rounds, so being the first pick in the sixth round isn't so bad," Eldred said.

Pitcher Andrew Edwards was the only Golden Panther taken on the second day of the draft.

FIU was also hurt by the draft when top recruit Robert Andino, out of Miami Southridge, was selected early in the draft. The Florida Marlins chose Andino with the 52nd overall selection.

Headline: New festival director hired
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Three years, three film festival directors. The first to go was Natilo Chediak, the man who created the Miami Film Festival. Next was his replacement, David Poland, a journalist from Los Angeles. And just last week, FIU hired Nicole Guillemet, the former co director of Robert Redford's Sundance Film Festival to lead the festival into its 20th year.
Two other candidates were flown to Miami and interviewed for the position. Guillemet was interviewed last.

Chediak chose not to reapply for the position of film festival director because FIU wanted the festival to double in size.

Poland, who left the film festival four months ago, resigned because FIU would not make the staff changes Poland felt were necessary to improve the festival.

Guillemet, the festival's new leader, left the highly acclaimed Sundance Institute, where she was vice president and second only to Redford, because it was just her time to go.

"It was time to leave after 15 years," she said.

Unlike the previous director, however, Guillemet does have plans to stay for a lot longer than seven months.

"I am known for long-term commitment," she said.

Guillemet decided to begin working with FIU and the Miami Film Festival because of the excitement she saw in the faces of the people on the search committee.

"I saw so much enthusiasm in the people I met," she said. "What makes you join a team is the enthusiasm and the feeling that people want things to happen."

Dale Webb, FIU's vice president of external relations, said hiring Guillemet was an easy choice.

"Nicole has the expertise, industry connections and was in a leadership role with a major film festival," Webb said.

Guillemet had all the qualities FIU wanted in a director, Film Studies Program Director Barbara Weitz said. 

"We were looking for someone with a strong presence to represent the film festival," she said.

Guillemet would not comment on her plans for the 20th Miami Film Festival, which will run from Feb. 21-March 2.

"[It's] too premature," she said. "What I want to do in the next month is to articulate a program that doesn't stray too far from what happened last year."

The films Guillemet will choose will have "stories that are original, showing a point of view and [that are] interesting," she said.

The 2002 festival, which was the largest in the film festival's history, featured about 50 films. Some of the most popular included "Y Tu Mama Tambien," "Audition" and "Raw Deal." Despite its expanded programming, the 2002 festival was not as well received as the other 18.

Guillemet has no plans to lessen the number of films shown at the 2003 festival, "but certainly not more [films] than last year," she said.

Although Guillemet did not want to say what she has planned for the festival, Webb said the 2003 Miami Film Festival will not focus on Latin American films but that there would be "strong programming" for those films.

Weitz hopes having Guillemet at FIU will mean the university will have more participation in the festival. 

"She is very enthusiastic about integrating FIU, its faculty and students, into the film festival," she said.

Headline: Software consolidates admissions, financial aid
Author: Adriana Oliva / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
PantherSoft, a new web based program, will be replacing the current FIU student system, financial aid system and payroll system for faculty and staff members. 

 "The goal of the PantherSoft Project is to facilitate FIU's mission of instruction, research and community service, by improving the University's administrative functions and activities through the implementation of student administration, human resources, pay roll, and financial systems," PantherSoft Project Manger Art Herbert said.

The new implemented system is set to begin working by fall 2003, starting with student admissions. This is a tentative date.

 "PantherSoft is a multi-million [dollar], multi-year program so it will be a few years before all the components are working and everything is in full effect," Assistant Director of Operations Yogi Misir said.

Current system setbacks include the inability to register for future terms, check pre-requisites for class registration and the amount of time required to process student financial aid checks.  

 "It's great that students are going to have the opportunity to register for future semesters," said freshman Jose Baretto. "It'll be a lot easier when trying to coordinate a work and school schedule."

The new system will also be able to check and make sure pre-requisites are met before registering for a class.

"You will not able to register for ENC 1102 if you haven't taken 1101 and the same goes for math or any other courses that involve pre-requisites," Herbert said.

The admissions process will be automated and will include application evaluations, external test score loadings and application loading from test score data. 

Along with an easier student registration and admissions process, there will also be a simpler financial aid process. The will be less paper dependency, allowing things to be more accurate and efficient.

Students will also be able to get the remainder of their financial aid money quicker. They will have the option of having the extra funds directly deposited into their bank accounts.

 "I think it's great that what's left over of money will come to us quicker," said sophomore Frances Varona. "It takes too long to wait for it in the mail." 

The PantherSoft team has been working since December 2001 and still a have a long road ahead.

The program itself will allow the University to also be less paper dependant. 

 "This program seems to be one of the best things that will happen to FIU," said sophomore Beatriz Colonia. "It's good that we will be able to take care of most our needs from the comforts of our own computers instead of having to make dreadful lines to speak with school staff."

Headline: Improving conditions at the College of Engineering
Subheadline: Students, administrators work to solve problems
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Since January Dean Vish Prasad has been working on renovations, physical and otherwise, for the College of Engineering. Thisrefurbishment is slowly but surely becoming a reality.

For starters Dr.Paul Gallagher, executive vice president of business and finance, had been charged with the duty of planning and supervising landscaping on the premises.

This is one of the most important aspects of the renovation efforts because landscaping has never existed at the building, at least since FIU purchased it over a decade ago. 

Gallagher assigned this task to Greg Burdine-Coakley, assistant director of facilities operation. Burdine-Coakley, who has been planning the landscape for the past few weeks, says he will continue to do so for about the next two months. Then, various contractors will be asked to estimate how much time and money the proposed plans would require. 

In the past, communicating with College of Engineering students had been a taxing task for the University Park campus. The college is considered a part of University Park but, depending on traffic, can be about 15 to 45 minutes away, former UP College of Engineering Representative Adrian Arbide said.

In order to overcome this problem, Prasad brainstormed with Dr. Patricia Telles-Irvin, vice president of student affairs and human resources. Together they came up with two solutions: bulletinboards and pamphlets.
Bulletin boards located around the engineering building will promoteevents on campus engineering students otherwise might not have heard about.

Informative pamphlets featuring the various organizations and programs FIU has to offer will be located around the campus.

In addition to these two links, FIU's website hasbecome an increasingly popular destination for College of Engineeringstudents wanting to know something about the university.

"The web has become a very important tool for keeping the line ofcommunication between the college and the rest of the school open,"said Telles-Irvin.

Luis Martinez, the Student Government Council's current Collegeof Engineering representative has not only supported the dean'sefforts but made a few of his own.

At the May 23 SGC meeting, Martinez and Student Services Chair Alessandro Baghara presented and passed a resolutionsupporting the placement of a traffic light on the corner of SW 105th Ave. and Flagler St.

Because of the at-times horrendous traffic in and around the school, particularly during rush hour, the installation of this light has received nods fromvirtually everybody who drives through there.

Another resolution, this one advocating the creation of an Ad-Hocengineering committee, was sponsored by Student Government Vice President OmarCastillo who is a student at the College of Engineering, Representative at Large Jorge Rosarioand Lower Division Representative Jacqui Sosa.

The purpose of this committee, which by definition is only temporary, is to gather information regarding the most important issues that concern the College of Engineering, and to come up with possible strategies on how to implement the suggested solutions.

"The Ad-Hoc council was created in order to get [engineering] studentsmore involved in school affairs and to make their issues heard," Martinez said. "SGA canonly do so much."

At the first meeting of this new organization, held on Monday, June 3,attendees set up the organization's agenda. Promotion of SPC events such as movies and comedy shows and FIU's new school spirit, student lounges, and security including emergency call boxes in the parking lots were just some of the issues placed there.

The committee's other goals include promoting use of the new, on-campus library and the implementation of functional elevators and fire extinguishers. 

Martinez will make efforts to inform the rest of FIU about the problemsplaguing the College of Engineering and the intended solutions in other waysas well.

During the coming months, he will give SGC and the EngineeringStudent Council a presentation detailing the school and comparing it to therest of the University Park campus.

This comparison will show audience members the changes that have already taken place in the recent past and those  yet to come.
With this presentation he hopes to get the full support of bothorganizations in the College's efforts to continue improving the school.

"Instead of everybody coming to the school, I can bring [SGC] theproblems. What I'm going to do is much easier than giving them a tour of theschool," he said.

Asked about his prognosis for the school, Martinez said "so far,changes have been positive; the ball is rolling. I just want to make surethat it rolls in the right direction."

Headline: Scooby Doo fills screen with poo
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Those who put it together have described "Scooby Doo" as a labor of love. But then how come what I saw on the screen was more like a spit in the face of everything fans loved about the cartoon? Every single scene plays out with a wink and a nudge and a fart toward the audience that is apparently supposed to consist of twenty-somethings with the IQ of six year olds. I hate to say it because it sounds like the same bad joke that's probably run in a hundred other newspapers, but "Scooby Doo" really is dog poop.

The biggest problem with "Scooby Doo" is that it can't make up its mind about whether to play it the "gee, wasn't this show stupid?" tongue-in-cheek style of the "Brady Bunch" movies or if it should try and remain honorable to the show and aim for the same audience that the show had: kids. 

This results in a schizophrenic movie: one minute, Scooby and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) are hijinxing around with food, the next minute, Fred (Freddy Prinze Jr) is talking ghetto slang and Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is whining about always being the damsel in distress.

The badness of the movie can be summed up in the fact that Fred is allowed to say "biatch," but the villain uttering the same word (only sans the "a") makes the characters gasp in shock. If you're making a family film, drop the pot humor. 

If you're not making a movie for the wee tykes, why fight so hard to stay PG? It's this hypocrisy that made me wince in my chair for the entire 70 minutes of the movie. 

What? You want plot? Fine. Scooby, Shaggy, Daphne, Fred and Velma (Linda Cardinelli) go to solve a mystery on "Spooky Island." They bicker and fight about their importance to the gang and save the world. There. I've spared you the horror. Now, don't go see this movie. If you're that desperate for a fixing of new "Doo," go rent "Scooby Doo In Zombie Island." It's everything this film aspired to be only animated and without Freddie Prinze Jr, so it's better.

Headline: "Bad Company" remains true to title
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
The way I figure it, if you're planning to put a cultured veteran actor best known for playing serious roles and a big-mouthed insult-comic actor from "Saturday Night Live" together in the same action movie, then you are required to also put a substantial amount of comedy in the plot to make it work. I just don't see that happening in "Bad Company," the new movie starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock.Although it's heavy on the action, the level of humor leaves plenty to be desired. 

With one of today's top comedians as the main character, I assumed it would get a lot of laughs. I guess I dropped the ball on that one. I suppose this was to be expected. After all, Joel Schumacher, the cinematic genius who gave us the last two Batman movies, directed it. In case you can't tell, those quotation marks mean I'm being sarcastic.
Chris Rock plays Kevin Pope, one of the CIA's most highly decorated agents: college graduate, former navy officer, and probably the only African-American his age that never listens to hip-hop. Working undercover as a dealer of fine antiques in Prague, he, along with his partner and mentor, Gaylord Oakes (Sir Anthony Hopkins) attempts to buy a thermonuclear device from the Russian Mafia. They successfully make the deal, but they're attacked by terrorists who they outbid for the bomb. They put up a good fight, but Pope is killed at the last second. This does not bode well for the mission, because the exchange for the device goes down in nine days and he absolutely, positively, has to be there. So what is the CIA to do, pull out a spare Kevin Pope? Apparently one should never underestimate their abilities, because that's exactly what they do. Oddly enough, Kevin has a long lost twin brother. Gee, what an original concept.

New Jersey resident Jake Hayes (also Chris Rock) is almost completely the opposite of his brother: he's a college dropout who wouldn't serve in a restaurant, much less the navy, and makes a living mostly on small-time jobs like scalping tickets. Sure, he's very intelligent and streetwise, his unbeatable chess techniques will prove that in a second, but he constantly squanders his potential as a hustler. The only thing about his life that really means anything to him is his girlfriend Julie, played by Kerry Washinton. However, she's planning to move to Seattle so there doesn't appear to be a bright future in that relationship. With a severe lack of enthusiasm, Jake doesn't seem to know where to go from there. 

At this point, he is contacted and approached by agent Oakes who asks him for a favor: to stand in for his twin brother. He gladly accepts, for a reasonably large fee, of course. However, this means he has to learn everything about his brother in eight days in order to properly think and act just like him. Such as his preferred type of music, where he lives, his neighbors, he even has to learn about antiques. Needless to say, the odds aren't exactly in his favor.

With the exception of a few of the action sequences, "Bad Company" is a seriously flawed movie. The previews give the impression that this film is full of laughs, but in truth, there is very little funny stuff and what there is barely merits the name. The comedy antics of Chris Rock were completely wasted. I expected to see some of the same class and style he showed in "Lethal Weapon 4." 

If this was an attempt at a serious roll for him, then he needs more practice. The movie's release date was originally set for last fall, but was delayed because of the 9/11 attacks. 

In fact, some of the scenes were filmed at the World Trade Center. I thought the plot of a hustler taking the place of his CIA twin brother was intriguing, but in this case, it wasn't played out well. "Bad Company" has proved once and for all that Joel Schumacher is a very incompetent movie director.

Headline: Vanessa Carlton hits right keys
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
What is it that makes Vanessa Carlton, the fresh vocal star hailing from Pennsylvania, so different from your typical Britney or Christina? That's an easy one: Carlton has talent. What type of talent, you may ask? She not only began composing music when she was eight years old, but she is also a master of the piano, which she took up at the age of two, picking out the notes to Disney's "It's a Small World." Now at 22, Carlton has released her debut album, Be Not Nobody.

Since she is the new kid on the block, she is being compared to previous stars. In terms of her voice and demeanor, I would place her somewhere in between Jewel and Tori Amos. But one noticeable factor that distinguishes her is the use of an orchestra. This is something unusual these days for a new female artist. Listening to many of the songs, I would say that it is the orchestra and her piano that are inspiring and not so much her voice. Another discernible characteristic is that she utilizes such diversity throughout her album. Maybe because she grew up listening to a wide repertoire of music, including everything from Mozart and Pink Floyd to Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac, this album contains an array of musical influences from waltz to pop. 

Her lyrics are well-written, and the orchestra is outstanding. However, after awhile, I am not too crazy about the overly sweet ring in her voice. Overall, I tremendously enjoy the instrumentation, but Carlton's voice is not so different from Tori Amos or Jewel. But there are a definitely some distinguished tracks. 

"A Thousand Miles" is the most popular song on the album. This is the track that has led Vanessa to stardom. I have heard people compare this song to the mellow melodies by pianist Bruce Hornsby. You've probably heard this song on the radio or seen the video on music television. If you haven't, you're missing out. Forget about the lyrics for a moment and concentrate on her instrumental abilities. 

Even if you didn't know that Carlton was an accomplished pianist before hearing this track, you would immediately learn so once this song begins. The combination of her cheerful piano playing, and at times, her sad voice, sets the tone for the song. 

Occasionally, it's almost like the piano's vivaciousness fools us into believing that the song is completely happy, but if you listen carefully to her voice and the words she sings, we are forced to think that something is missing. Perhaps there is a hint of sorrow. 

 "Ordinary Day" is my favorite track on the entire album. What makes it so great is the fervor of the orchestra which plays in the background and the way Vanessa's passionately powerful voice compliments and strengthens the orchestra's intensity. I also like that the lyrics are uplifting. These components are what make this song the most inspirational.    

"Paint it Black," a Rolling Stone classic, and "Unsung" are also upbeat, including elements of rock along with the instrumentation. The mixture of rock, classical instruments and her piano create definite diversity yet again. And while her voice does get irritating during "Unsung," the combination of these three things is what makes her unique in contrast to other female artists. 

Her songs range from being extremely upbeat to depressing, so there is diversity in that sense as well. Let's take a look at another song, "Twilight." We know that "A Thousand Miles" is happy with an allusion to sadness, but the tone of "Twilight" is a no-brainer. 

Vanessa is simply despondent and regretful, but she doesn't let us in on her secret as to why she feels so much pain: "And I will never see the sky the same way and I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday." Because of its sorrowful tenor, this track immediately reminds me of some of the songs by Tori Amos, whose music is seldom happy, but who is also a proficient piano player.  

If you think about it, it's pretty impressive that someone of such a young age is this talented: Singer, songwriter, pianist. Vanessa is definitely deserving of fame, so let's just hope that her music doesn't get treated like that of many other artists who come and go so quickly. With a bit of luck, "A Thousand Miles" will actually take her thousands of miles.

Headline: Cubans stuck in Republican mindset
Author: Jay Santiago / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Miami has always been known as a city of diversity; a blend of cultures, races and people.  Diverse except, however, when it comes to politics.  It's controlled by the Cuban population and their strong set of beliefs.  What are these beliefs?  That can be answered in one word: Republican.  Nothing else seems to matter.  Not issues, not politics &#8211; not even their background.  Nothing.  All that matters is that party affiliation by the side of their name.  

Many of the reasons that the Cuban vote tends to be republican stems from events that transpired about forty years ago.  John F. Kennedy avoided nuclear war.  Richard Nixon committed numerous crimes that included burglary, vandalism and a huge cover-up.  The difference between the two: one was a Democrat, the other a Republican.  This explains why Kennedy is seen as a disgrace and Nixon a success in the eyes of many Cubans. 

Cubans, in general, tend to be blind.  They only see what they want to see.  They only fight when the feel like fighting.  When Elian Gonzalez was here for a short time, streets were closed, jobs shut down, rallies held, leaders came out and spoke.  

When 12 Haitians, half of them, children suffering from malnutrition, landed in the Keys, did anyone help?  I don't remember seeing Gloria singing for those people.  Of course not, the television cameras weren't around.  They didn't get any help, because we tend to help only when it benefits us as well.

Now there is the case of the "dry foot rule" which means any Cuban that reaches land gets to stay.  Now, an educated person can rule out this scenario for a few reasons.  First of all, the second Elian's mom died, his father became legal guardian.  Secondly, he didn't reach land; he was picked up at sea.  Third, he was seven years old, not old enough to make his own decision.  So the case should've been simple right?  

No, instead the Cuban population, for the most part, created a spectacle only seen in Miami. 

Then there's good ol' Jeb Bush, Governor of Florida.  It seems like all he did while the whole affirmative action mess was going on was sit around.   What a great Governor.  But who cares?  He's Republican.  Poor guy; it's not his fault.  Let's blame the Democrats in Washington.  

Many times, as a Cuban, you are looked down upon for being a Democrat in the eyes of other Cubans.  I'm proud to be a Democrat, but you should hear some of the things  I've been referred to as for my political ideology.  I've been called everything from stupid to a traitor.  For what? For a set of beliefs?  This from a people who left their country so they could think and speak freely.  

Like I said, though, I'm proud to be Cuban.  On the other hand, I'm proud to be a Democrat, and I'll let that be known &#8211; unless, of course, I ever want to get elected.

Headline: Women not excluded from catching World Cup fever
Author: Helena Poleo
&nbsp;
The World Cup is here.  Twenty-two sweaty guys chasing a ball for 90 minutes over a whole month.  Believe it or not, many women are happy the time has come.

I don't watch every single soccer match televised throughout the year, but when it comes to the World Cup, it's a whole different ball game.  For the past four years, I have been waiting anxiously for this moment.  I watched the Euro Cup two years ago, trying to gauge which team would be better than the rest when the time for the 2002 World Cup rolled around.  I've been following each World Cup game religiously, keeping track of the scores and making predictions for the final, which I'll keep to myself at this time.

True, I may not know the name of every player, or follow their every move during off-years.  And, no, I do not stay up all night watching games live, but instead watch the repeats during the day. 

But, regardless of midterms and papers, I sit down three times a day and watch the games.  Alongside a few guy friends, I cheer my team and boo their opponent.

I love the game, the teams and the players.  I love the noise of the fans in the stadium, the colorful painted faces, the flags from all over the world hanging from the walls, and watching the players' expressions as they score or miss a goal.  Their dances of joy after scoring are legendary.  Who can forget Senegal's celebration after scoring against the World Champion, France?  

Let's go back to the players for a second: a field-full of guys in perfect shape, strutting their stuff and flexing their muscles, looking irresistibly manly – What's there not to like?

But in all seriousness, the World Cup is a melting pot for the world.  The men on each one of those teams are representing their country and wearing their colors with pride.  How much more patriotic can you be? Every team is different, not only in their team colors, but in their names, facial features and language.  That clear distinction makes the game even more fun to watch.  

A French player cannot walk into another team if a more attractive offer is made in, say, the Italian team for example.  If you are English, you play for the English team.  Period.  

Unlike American football, a player can't leave his old team and his old fans to join another team to make more money.  At least in the World Cup, the loyalty in soccer is golden.

The unpredictability of the sport is yet another aspect which has me hooked on it.  I watched in disbelief as Senegal scored against France, winning the game.  My jaw dropped when I learned the World Champions along with Argentina and Portugal, two other heavy favorites, wouldn't make it to the next round.  There is just no telling what can happen now.  The uncertainty and excitement is better than watching a suspense movie.

Now, if you'll excuse me, guys, the popcorn has been popped and the sodas cooled.  It's time to watch the game.

Subheadline: University should cede festival control to director
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Last week FIU hired a new director for the Miami Film Festival. 

This time around the university hired someone with lots of leadership experience relating to a film festival, someone with the industry connections to help improve the festival – Nicole Guillemet.

While the name may not be familiar to most, Guillemet has spent about 15 years of her life in different posts at the Sundance Film Festival, one of the largest, most popular festivals in the world.

Since 1996, Guillemet has been the codirector of the festival. She was also the vice president of the Sundance Institute. In that role, she assumed control of the festival's fundraising and finance arms and managed to bring the institute out of deficit.

FIU is lucky enough to have found someone as qualified as Guillemet to run the Miami Film Festival but one wonders what the university will do this time around to wind up losing another director.

This has been the unfortunate trend FIU has settled itself into these past two years. 

The first to go was Nat Chediak, the Miami Film Festival founder who left because FIU wanted to double the number of films shown. 

Next was David Poland, a journalist who left the festival only four months ago because FIU would not hire the staff he felt was necessary to improve the festival.

The under-lying theme in these two situations is that the university does not seem willing to cede control of the festival over the people it hires to run it.

The university should make more of a concilliatory effort to keep its film festival directors around. 

The university should be willing to listen to their film festival directors – the people who actually have experience running a festival.

FIU should learn from its previous mistakes. If not, the university could lose someone like Guillemet – someone who has helped the Sundance Film Festival become internationally recognized and could do the same for Miami.

Headline: Twins Mary-Kate, Ashley arrested in Olsen-gate
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It has been twenty-seven years since "Full House"ran its final "very special episode" of the hit ABC program. In that episode, Michelle Tanner, played by the percocious twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, falls off a horse and gets amnesia, and she relies on her family and friends to help jog her memory back.

After the recent unlucky turn of events in their lives, the Olsen twins are probably begging for amnesia.

Recently, the Olsen twins' media empire has found itself crumbling amidst rumors of a massive Enron-like scandal. The events of which came last Friday, when police raided the twins' Santa Monica ranch, arresting the adorable-twosome and charging them with tax-evasion, money laundering and fraud.

According to police reports obtained by The Bacon, the twins were found in the ranch's game room in a compromising position. "Mary-Kate was stuffing bean bag chairs with shredded documents. Ashley was discovered in the adjoining bathroom, painting the documents in neon-paints, and turning them into paper-mache beaded necklaces."

After scouring through the 376-page court document on these events, The Bacon staff took a nap. Then, they woke up, reflected on this ridiculously bad attempt at satire, and wrote their opinions on this phony-baloney news article.

George Foothills, Production Manager

This is an outright lamentable tragedy. I have been following this talented double-mint pair of actresses ever since I caught them stealing the movie "It Takes Two" from Steve Guttenberg and Kirstie Alley. Since then, they've starred in hit after hit movie. "Passport to Paris," "Winning London," and the underrated  "The Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen: The Case of the Sea World Adventure;" all classic works of modern cinema and darn adorable flicks with catchy tunes sung by the twins in duet.

And was I the only one who was outraged when Disney didn't cast them in "The Parent Trap" remake?

I for one do not believe any of this scandal. If you ask me, most of these alleged "shredded documents" were probably the countless rejected scripts send to them by Dave Coulier.

Maura Rosenberg, Opinion Editor

Well, if you ask me, this all began when Michelle Tanner first said the words "You got it, dude," which unbeknowst to the twins, was actually a code word that alerted a secret government agency on the ties between farmers and the plot to rub bananas on an effigy of Shakespeare. With an upbringing like that, it's no suprise they went down this road.  

Although it's sad to see these scandals come to light, it was necessary in order to bring to light a greater, overriding controversy: the subversive, evil and inevitable conspiracy to strip us of our first amendment right to assemble peacefully in slumber parties. In fact, since the scandal, it has come to light that many slumber parties to date have included undercover agents. Bravo Olsen twins, crusaders in the fight for rights!  

Colin Stalin, Arts Editor

It always amuses me to see the common news chasers obsess with  every semi-celebrity. Just because the reach of their Empire rivals that of England at its colonialist zenith doesn't mean that the Olsen twins should be greeted with the all-consuming hatred of these plebeians that try to bring them down. I say we allow these amazing business-women the privacy that their many managerial successess have earned them over the years, and leave them room to steer their wonderful career into even more glorious streams. 

Chrystopher Richter, News Editor

Hah! [Bleeps] had it coming. 

Maybe next the cops can arrest that annoying [bleep] who played Kimmy Gibler. Ugly [bleeping] [bleep].

Now, that Six chick from "Blossom"? She was [bleeping] hot. Annoying, but [bleeping] hot.

Headline: Weezer treads new ground
Author: John Lovell
&nbsp;
It was the summer after my sixth grade year and I had saved up enough allowance to purchase my first CD. I ran to the record store and picked up a copy of an untitled, blue-colored album put out by a band who had the most peculiar name. In 1994, Weezer was the radio sensation at the time, with presently classic songs such as "My Name is Jonas" and "Buddy Holly." 

As the years have gone by, the legendary Blue Album has become a staple in music libraries and is recognized by rock fans everywhere as one of the greatest musical triumphs ever.

The records following the Blue Album have each taken on personalities of their own. Weezer varies their sound and redefines their identity a bit differently with each album. 

Their second release, Pinkerton, displayed a more emotional and tormented approach to music. Last year's long awaited Weezer found  Weezer experimenting with a fluffier, bouncier, and dare I say "poppier" sound. Now the quartet puts their fourth release on record store shelves and it's no surprise that Maladroit is yet another turn in Weezer's long, musical journey. 

With last year's revival, after a five-year recording hiatus, Weezer showed the world that while clearly not the same exact band from 1994, they still had the rock and roll essentials that make these guys who they are. 

Maladroit takes on a new approach to this music-making method. It's actually the exact opposite of what it really means to be "maladroit."
Weezer is still Weezer, yet they've digressed a bit from the bubbly sounds of their previous release. Armed with the new found sound of the Weezer, Maladroit progresses to a sound that is a more mature. 
Rather than dousing the cake with icing, Weezer adds more substance to the cake; doing things more musically and lyrically. Maladroit is also a very upbeat album, never slowing its tempo down further than a light, rock ballad.

The tracks "Slob" and "Keep Fishin'" are perfect examples of this type of musical substance. Complex rhythms and melodies, fun lyrics, all blended with a sound that resonates with familiarity. 

The funky track, "Burndt Jamb," displays their ability to achieve music hybrids, combining whimsical, funky beats with rock and roll. "Dope Nose," the made for TV and radio single, cries out with a strange kind of victory as if it were some miraculous achievement. Ironically, it's my least favorite track on the album.

Although Weezer will probably never reproduce the same magic found on the Blue Album, they'll keep making new magic, as they do with Maladroit. No band should ever constantly repeat themselves, so these differences in Weezer's style are very essential in remaining a creative force to be reckoned with. Without change, things tend to get boring and ingenuity is lost to the horrors of repetition. As long as this band remains a band, they'll always be successful in capturing the hearts of their fans.
