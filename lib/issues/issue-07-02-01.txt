Headline: Brunch honors Cuban poet, hero
Author: Jessica Solis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The live latin music was blaring and the Cuban coffee was flowing at the Seventh Annual Jose Marti Scholarship Breakfast/Brunch at the Wolfe University Center Ballroom in the Biscayne Bay Campus.

This event is held every Jan. 28 in honor of Jose Marti, known as the father of Cuban independence, who was not only a political figure, but also a poet, journalist and professor.

The event was started in 2000 by former FIU vice provost Raul Moncarz and has become an event that not only celebrates student achievement, but culture and diversity.

"Every year we make it more international, which is what we want to do," Moncarz said. 

Hosting the event was Chef Pepin, a well-known television personality in the Latin community. His extroverted personality relaxed the audience but he also spoke of how imperative it is for the Latin youth to be aware of Marti and his impact on Cuban history.

"We are recognizing a Cuban patriot that went beyond our borders. It's extremely important for the generations to come to know the work of this great man," Pepin said. "[Marti] was a visionary and many of his thoughts are vivid today as they were a hundred years ago."

The national anthems of Cuba and the United States kicked off the celebration, and the audience stood and sang along to both, shouting "Viva Cuba libre!" meaning "Long live a free cuba" as the Cuban anthem ended.

Miami musician Carlos Averhoff, Grammy award winning saxophonist Ahmed Barroso and FIU alumna Maggie Marquez provided a varied mix of music that spanned genres. Cuban standards were played alongside Frank Sinatra classics while a light breakfast was served.

Educating today's students about Marti is something the Jose Marti Scholarship Breakfast Committee aims to do every year. Through a donation given to FIU by Jose Badia, president and owner of Badia Spices, a gift certificate to the FIU bookstore worth $250, and five scholarships in the amount of $2,000 each were given to FIU students who had winning entries in several Marti essay competitions.

None of the five scholarship recipients were present at the event. In attendance, though, was senior Luckner Pierre, winner of the gift certificate prize. His essay about Jose Marti's thoughts on immigration was a way for him to discover the author's ideas.

"I wanted to learn more about the purpose of his evolution. Jose Marti gave me the representation of freedom and liberty," Pierre said.

Marti's ability to bring Cuba together and fight for independence from Spain in the 1800s is still seen as one of the most important figures in Latin American history

Several essays on Marti's poems were submitted for the scholarship prize as well. A committee comprised of professors from the College of Arts and Sciences and the department of modern languages chose the winning essay for the gift certificate prize, and a scholarship committee based at University Park chose the five winning essays for the scholarship prize.

Participating in the essay competitions has several advantages, according to Carmen Evans de Jesus, a member of the Jose Marti Scholarship Breakfast Committee.

"It stimulates [students] to want to know more, and at the same time you're helping them so they can buy their books or pay tuition," she said.

According to Mercedes Kuper, also a committee member, Marti's words and ideas have the ability to inspire people, especially in today's society where many are quick to take sides.

"From what I've read about Marti, he was an incredible poet and an incredible unifier," Kuper said. "I think we need that right now."

The event's keynote speaker was Ferdie "The Fight Doctor" Pacheco, a man whose career has been as eclectic as Marti's. He began his career as a doctor, setting up a practice in his hometown of Tampa, Fla. Eventually, Pacheco became best known for his work with the championship boxer Muhammad Ali. Being Ali's corner man and physician for 17 years earned Pacheco the nickname "The Fight Doctor." After retiring from boxing, Pacheco began a career as a painter and celebrities such as Andy Garcia and Shirley MacLaine have purchased his paintings.

He spoke about his accomplishments, his life, and what he believed Marti wanted to accomplish. 

"What Marti dreamt could have been the republic of Cuba if we would've followed his principles," Pacheco told the audience in Spanish.

 One of Pacheco's paintings depicting Jose Marti was then unveiled and presented to BBC. The painting, a permanent gift to the University, is to be displayed in the "Rincon Martiano" of the BBC Library.

After Pacheco's address, the dancing and the festivities resumed. A Latin brunch consisting of rice with chicken and fried plantains satisfied the crowd, while a flamenco dancer stomped and twirled on stage. Afterward, a troupe of dancers from Our Lady of Lourdes Academy energized the audience with a salsa number. 

Sophomore Lorilee Valientes wanted to learn about Marti and experience Latin culture up-close.

"It's very fun to see something different," Valientes said. "I liked the performances, the different music, the different types of dancing."

Brazilian sophomore Matheus Morias enjoyed the event as well. When asked what his favorite part of the event was, he was clear that all of it was the highlight.

"The Latin part. That's more my flavor," Morias said with a smile

Headline: Vacant slots in SOC executive board now filled
Author: Nicole Acosta and Ana Davis / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
The Student Organizations Council held a special election Jan. 25 to fill executive board positions that have been vacant since Fall.

The vice-president, treasurer, secretary, events coordinator and marketing director positions now have official members as part of the SOC executive board after winners for those positions were voted in by SOC registered clubs. Each club had one representative per club vote, although according to SOC president Jon Doozan, there were only about 10 to 12 clubs who voted during the elections out of the 31 clubs registered under the Biscayne Bay Campus's SOC.

The new events coordinator, Mike Parker, a freshman majoring in hospitality and tourism management, won with two-thirds of the vote.

Freshman Joe Mintz ran against two other candidates for the position of vice president and won by one vote.

Jose Flores, the new treasurer, Sabrina SaintJour, the new secretary, and new marketing director Carla St. Louis all ran unopposed.

"I'm very excited to have a full e-board. Trying to do all the work myself has been very strenuous, so it'll be great to be able to delegate some things," Doozan said, who took over former president Yashica Heath's position last Fall after she graduated.

The new SOC representatives will work approximately 10 hours a week and are allowed to set their work around class schedule. These new council members will work together until their term is up this April when the annual elections take place.

The newly elected executive board members talked about their positions and their plans during and after their tenure in phone conversations with The Beacon. Flores, however, was unavailable for comment as of press time.



Q. Why did you run for your position?

SaintJour: I already had some e-board experience as treasurer of the Black Student Union at [University Park], so I wanted to challenge myself with a higher position in a larger organization.

St. Louis: I wanted to be part of a student based campus organization. One of the requirements was that they needed a liaison between The Beacon and SOC, and I thought it would be easier for them, and for me, too, to do because I have an established relationship with The Beacon.

Mintz: I was presented with the opportunity by [Doozan] and I thought that by getting involved I would have a positive impact.

Parker: I think I can contribute something, I'm a people person.



Q. Will you run again for your position next year?

SaintJour: Yes, I want to influence the way that clubs are in [BBC] as far as membership and clubs that are represented.

St. Louis: I don't know if I will because it's too early to say. I don't know what next year is going to look like but if the position continues the way that it's going, yeah, I probably will. 

Mintz: I really can't say what the future holds.

Parker: I think it's too early to say.



Q. Out of all the clubs in BBC, around 10 clubs were present at the voting. How will you go about securing more active participation?

SaintJour: I hope we can encourage people to get involved in the campus through community workshops and team building.

St. Louis: I guess besides encouraging participation I plan to make it mandatory. At least make it so that if some don't participate, at least 50 percent will.

Mintz: To get clubs involved with SOC, SOC has to become involved with the clubs. We need to get more involved with the clubs.

Parker: I haven't thought about that yet. We need to get the clubs to communicate. I think we are not cohesive enough, that was one of my motivations for joining [SOC].

Headline: Trivial Pursuit...a pop culture column: Commercials overshadow football
Author: Reuben Pereira / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This Sunday, the Indianapolis Colts will take on the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI, which will attract an average of more than 90 million American viewers and millions more worldwide. While football is a relatively new sport to me, I'll be watching the Super Bowl with those other 90 million people. But my reason for watching the big game will be slightly different from most others.

Every sports site I visit is dominated by analyst predictions, reader polls and the like. To tell you the truth, I couldn't care less if it's the Colts or the Bears. They're both fine teams and either would make a deserving winner. My real interest in the Super Bowl are the advertisements. Everyone knows that the most entertaining aspect of the bowl are the advertisements and the half time show. Sure, the game is a tradition and all, but the ads are the icing on the cake.

Being an advertising major, the ads are all the more interesting to me. Last year, one of my professors made us watch and select the best advertisements from the game. That's actually harder than it sounds - many of the best advertisements aren't the most popular ones. 

Take for example, the immensely popular Geico ads. Sure, the caveman gimmick was funny at first, but now it's just gone too far. What do I know about Geico besides the fact that it's an insurance company? Absolutely nothing. You could argue that name recognition is their pitch but wasn't that the idea three years ago? On the other hand, the Apple commercials with the two actors portraying the PC and the Mac are fantastic advertisements, in my opinion, because they tell me the benefits of using a Mac while not portraying the PC as worthless. However, this doesn't necessarily apply for the Super Bowl since companies are all fighting to be remembered after the game. Often, the most bizarre and funniest spots tend to be remembered and quoted by people after the night and during water cooler breaks the next day.

For the advertising industry, the Super Bowl represents one of the few, if not the only large scale television event. They know that a good spot during the Bowl can potentially reach an audience of more than 100 million worldwide. The networks know this as well. That's why the price tag for a 30 second spot during the Super Bowl sells at between $2 - 2.8 million.  That's no small amount, even for big companies. They have to be at their zenith if they want to survive and be remembered above the others spots. This is why some of the greatest spots of all time have debuted during the Super Bowl, including two of the most popular and acclaimed spots ever - The Apple "1984" spot and Coke's "Mean Joe" clip. Both clips can be found at www.superbowl-ads.com. 

A good Super Bowl ad can not only increase the product sales but also influence pop culture. Influential spots that debuted at the Bowl include the "Where's the Beef?" spot for Wendy's and the award winning "Whaaaassup?" spot that ended up becoming a pop cultural phenomenon, inspiring countless spoofs and launching the career of the director.

Film studios also see the Bowl as a major outlet for debuting teaser trailers of their tent pole summer films. 

In 1996, the teasers for Independence Day featuring an exploding White House and Empire State Building with the disclaimer "Enjoy the Super Bowl, it may be your last" was enough to hype audiences for the alien invasion picture. It ended up becoming the highest grossing film of the year. Similar results were seen for films such as Shrek and War of the Worlds.

This year will see the beginning of a new trend: consumer created spots. Inspired by the popularity of YouTube and other companies websites such as Lays, General Motors, Doritos and even the NFL have invited fans and the general public to create their own spots which in-turn will be produced by professionals. 

While Super Bowl XLI will undoubtedly be a match-up between two titans of football that should result in some immensely entertaining football, the real fun for me at least, will be the time between the game play. Who knows, maybe one day, your idea may debut at the game.

Headline: Professor finds origins of rare diamonds - outer space
Author: Christopher Necuze / Production Manager
&nbsp;
After having a conversation with Stephen E. Haggerty, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Earth Sciences, there will be no doubt in your mind that not only are diamonds forever, but, in some cases, they are from interstellar space, too.

In a paper published last month in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters, Haggerty, along with a team of scientists from both FIU and Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, claim that carbonado diamonds - those diamonds more commonly yet incorrectly known as black diamonds - are actually extraterrestrial in origin.

"That's an extraordinary conclusion," Haggerty said about the theory. "That is the only conclusion that is compatible with the measurements that we've most currently made and reported."

To test his theory, Haggerty and his team first had to remove any trace contaminant minerals from the carbonado specimen they were testing, which otherwise could yield inaccurate readings.

Using the facilities at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, the scientists then used infrared synchrotron radiation to locate trace elements of hydrogen, an indicator that the mineral was formed in a hydrogen rich environment which Haggerty believes to be outer space, specifically a supernova explosion.

Carbonado diamonds have only been found in two locations globally - the Central African Republic and Brazil. Haggerty suspects that the diamond arrived while the Earth was still forming some 4 billion years ago, when Brazil and the Central African Republic were still part of the same landmass.

The idea ultimately corroborates Haggerty's theories as it explains how the diamonds could be found in locations oceans apart and still come from the same source.

Haggerty also points out that in the 600 million tons of natural diamonds mined in the twentieth century, not a single carbonado diamond has been found among them, not to mention the fact that the diamonds have traces of osborneite, a mineral that has only been known to exist in extraterrestrial sources such as meteors and comets.

"Surely, you could expect at least one if they are indeed terrestrial in origin," Haggerty said.

The significance of this discovery though, according to Haggerty, lies not so much in the discovery that carbonado diamonds are from space as it does in eliminating Earth and earthly processes as possible points of origin.

"Now most people have an obsession, and I don't, with its origin," Haggerty said. "The reasons that drive me to try and understand where it comes from are twofold: One is if it's from the Earth … then there has to be a new way in which Mother Nature has formed diamonds. The second reason is that the very unusual physical properties of carbonado means that although diamonds have been synthesized, carbonado has not."

Although carbonado diamonds are just as hard as regular diamonds, they are far tougher under stressful conditions than natural diamonds, making them extremely valuable for industrial drilling and cutting.

It is because of the vast practical uses of carbonado that Haggerty will now focus his efforts and research on trying to synthetically recreate the mineral in the lab, a feat that has yet to be achieved despite numerous efforts.

"My research is now dedicated to understand how nature put carbonado together," Haggerty said.

Headline: Editorial: Students should not bear burden of stadium costs
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
There is nothing inherently wrong with FIU getting a new football stadium.

The improved venue would be a landmark on campus, boosting school pride among students and alumni and impressing prospective students and potential football recruits alike.

"A crown jewel for the University," is what Pete Garcia, our new athletic director, called it.

The problem isn't so much in the idea of building a new stadium, but rather in the question of whether the investment is even financially sound.

FIU will be going up to $35 million dollars into debt to finance the project. 

In the documents it submitted before the Board of Governors when it sought permission to issue the bonds, FIU outlined a detailed proposal for paying back the money. According to the proposal, the bonds would be repaid from the stadium's revenue.

In theory, the source of this revenue, besides ticket sales, would be the sale of 14 luxury seats, advertising deals and network-distribution contracts. As the plan goes, crowds would sell the tickets out, high rollers would spend $5 to $10 million on luxury seats, advertisers would put placards on the sidelines and networks would pay big bucks to televise our football games.

It's a foolproof plan, on paper. In reality, though, foolhardy is the more fitting description.

The prospect of getting any major revenue from tickets is dubious. Though Phase I of the expansion would add 10,500 new seats, previous seasons' attendance records suggest that we should be so lucky if as much as half of them are filled.

The mid-game fight against the University of Miami produced the only media visibility the team got last season. If the team hasn't been able to secure media attention on its own merits - by winning games, for example - it's unlikely that a media contract will materialize.

Without media attention or half-decent attendance, it's hard to imagine that many advertisers will be eager to spend money on putting their names on the new stadium.

Finally, if no one wants to spend the $1 million a year for five to 10 years that FIU President Modesto A. Maidique expects to charge for the luxury seats, it's hard to blame them. Few people will want to spend that much on air-conditioned seats to watch a team go 0-10. 

According to the BOG proposal, there's a contingency plan in case the stadium's revenue comes up short: the bonds would be paid for with student fee money and funds from the FIU Foundation.

There's already talk of raising the athletic fee by $1.39 per credit hour. The fee is currently $10 a semester. It's unclear whether the increased fee would be assessed on top of those $10 or instead of them.

Either way, for a student taking a full course load, the fee would go up by at least one hundred percent.

Falling back on student fees to pay back the bonds was supposed to be a last resort, but the administration is already counting on them. 

Out of the $1.1 million the fee increase is supposed to bring in annually, the administration already committed $655,000 toward repaying the bonds.

Defaulting to the last-resort measure from day one not only seems like a premature admission of defeat, it's also disturbing, considering students haven't even voted on the increase yet.

Headline: BROKEN BORDERS: Immigration control is key to unity
Author: Jose Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Our nation, for as long as it has existed, has prided itself on the concept of being a nation "united," not only under a single governmental infrastructure, but under a single American cultural identity, and a distinct ideology, which encompasses every facet of life; our perceptions of morality, family, work ethic and countless other mundane aspects of existence.

However, in the past several decades, the very foundation of our "united" nation has begun to crumble due to the unrelenting pressures exerted by a certain divisive force; a phenomenon that has been brought to light by the growing heterogeneity and dissolution of the country's cultural identity. This is none other than immigration.

It is something that has been transpiring ceaselessly throughout the existence of our nation, yet now more than ever is beginning to have a detrimental effect on its solidarity and unity. More and more, racism is being directed at the burgeoning Hispanic minority, which has proliferated through immigration from the Spanish-speaking nations adjoining the United States, most notably, Mexico. The current policy being implemented to regulate the incursions of illegal immigrants into our nation is largely ineffective, solely due to the fact that it is not aggressive enough.

The borders of the United States are left largely unguarded, and open to the encroachments of any individual with the slightest inclination to enter. It is because of this that countless undocumented immigrants have been able to enter the United States for better of worse. 

This unguarded, and largely apathetic approach to defending our borders has cost this nation countless amounts of money in unpaid taxes, since undocumented immigrants are not taxed.

Many businesses have taken advantage of these immigrants, paying them substandard wages.  As a result many hard working Americans have been stripped of their  their jobs, by the ready availability of cheap labor. That's a travesty. Everyone should have a fair chance to compete in the labor market.

Furthermore, the most prominent and potent threat the unregulated influx of undocumented immigrants poses to American people is the schism they are creating between the people.

Our already inherently uncertain cultural identity is being blurred, and this merely makes us more divided.

Education in languages other than English is continually mentioned as these immigrants, many of whom have entered our country without documentation, seek to preserve the manner in which they lived before leaving their country.

This has become a divisive issue in much of the southwest, with bilingual education angering many conservatives, and with "english only" initiatives being passed in a few states.

There is even a movement to make English the official language of the United States. This may seem somewhat prejudiced, a reactionary policy aimed at a group of social outsiders, but without a common language, our ability to communicate with one another is hindered, and if we cannot communicate with each other, we will lose our unity.

Speaking one's native language is not problematic, and is in fact beneficial to the diversity of this country.

However, we must remember that the English language is the common language that unites us all as Americans. Immigrants must be mindful of this fact, and make an effort to learn it, and use it in their interactions with people not of their own ethnicity.

I commend individuals such as Congressman Tom Tancredo for bringing this issue to the forefront of American politics, for it is something that must be addressed, but not in his extreme and racially infused manner.

All immigration into the United States should be documented, and occur with the permission of the federal government, who have ensured that these individuals are not a threat to the safety of the American people, and who have insured that these individuals are placed in a job fairly, and in manner that does not displace other hard-working Americans from their only source of income.

Headline: Adley's late heroics steal win from Arkansas State
Author: Magaly Estrella / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It was a close game that came down to the final thirty seconds, but FIU's hustle and defense proved to be too much for Arkansas State.

The 64-61 victory Jan. 27 at Pharmed Arena was the fourth consecutive win for the Golden Panthers (13-8,7-4), fresh from two wins at Louisiana-Monroe and New Orleans.

The Golden Panthers started to pull away from Arkansas State (14-8,7-4) very early in the game after going on a 15-4 run in the first half - giving them a comfortable 14-point lead. 

However, the lead slowly started to decline when Arkansas State battled back and cut FIU's lead in half making the score 38-32 after Indians guard Rudy Sims nailed a three-pointer at the halftime buzzer.

At the start of the second half, ASU guard Adrianne Davie swooshed in a lay-up that brought the Indians within four points, the Indians' smallest deficit since the opening five minutes of the game.

FIU built back their lead scoring three consecutive 3-pointers during an 11-0 run in the second half, which gave the Golden Panthers their largest lead of the game at 16 points.

Arkansas State wasn't going to be shaken off that easily, fighting its way within four points with 1:06 left in the game after going on a 20-6 run.

With an opportunity to give the Golden Panthers some breathing room, sophomore foward Marquita Adley missed a pair of free throws after being fouled by Indian defender Caroline Starr.

On Arkansas State's next possession forward Lyndsay Schlup knocked down a jumper, bringing the Indians within two points with 31 seconds left in regulation.

After a timeout, Sims fouled Adley, earning her another trip to the free throw line.

Adley missed on her first attempt but connected on her second, helping FIU go up by three with 15 seconds left and putting all the pressure on the Indians.

Sims dribbled the ball down the court hoping to tie the game, but not before Adley weaseled her way in and stole the ball from Sims with five seconds left on the clock, sealing the victory for the Golden Panthers.

 "I had to make up for missing those free throws," Adley said, who finished nine points and rebounds.

Junior guard LaQuetta Ferguson led FIU with 20 points and was perfect from 3-point range, going 3-for-3.

Senior guard Eva Makela contributed with a season-high 17 points and six rebounds for FIU.

Makela was also 3-for-6 from 3-point land.

"I was much more active than usual and I took a lot more shots and some shots fell in," Makela said. "We had a good start and we played together as a team. It was a team victory."

Senior center Lasma Jekabsone was the third player for FIU that was in double digits, scoring 10 points.

Jekabsone had a game-high 12 rebounds and tied her career high of six assists.

The Golden Panthers look to win their fifth consecutive game on the road against Arkansas-Little Rock Feb. 1 at 6:15 p.m.

The Golden Panthers return home against Troy at 7:30 p.m.

"Little Rock is another big game. It's going to be a little bit more difficult because we're on their court. We just have to go in there and play excellent defense and come out with a victory," Ferguson said.

Headline: Colts pose match-up threats for Bears on defense and offense
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Super Bowl XLI will exhibit two teams with two different reputations. The Colts have the reputation of being an exciting, flashy, fast-paced team with limitless scoring potential. Conversely, the Chicago Bears' reputation lies in the their tough, hard-nosed, relentless defense.

Despite their different styles of playing, both teams have several similarities, which will dictate the outcome of the game.

Colts quarterback Peyton Manning has been criticized his whole career because of his inability to transfer his regular season talents to the playoffs. Bears quarterback Rex Grossman has been criticized for not winning any games with his arm - instead putting the Bears in a variety of precarious situations. The biggest difference between Manning and Grossman besides the huge statistical discrepancy, but the number of defenses Manning has seen. There are teams in the NFL Grossman has yet to even play against while Manning has seen a variety of elite defenses throughout his career. Manning has, once again, played at a mediocre level during the playoffs.

However, he was able to lead his team back from a 21-3 deficit following an interception he threw against the New England Patriots that was taken back for a touchdown. He managed to recover from these obstacles against a team that what his "daddy" the last four years. 

Grossman has managed not to make critical mistakes during the playoffs, but he hasn't been tested either. He has relied on his running game to limit his attempts, while Manning has had to throw continuously - even when he wasn't at his is determined not to fail on the grandest stage he has ever played on. He wants to break Dan Marino's records and not share the same stigma as him.

The commercials he stars in are nice, but the Super Bowl ring, which haunts him, is the only thing he cares about. 

Advantage: Colts.

The Bears and Colts running games are fueled by a duo running back system. Cedric Benson provides the power, and Thomas Jones provides the finesse for the Bears running attack. They alternate often in order to retain their stamina; their preserved endurance allows them to burn the clock at the end of games.

Dominic Rhodes and Joseph Addai are two efficient runners, but they lack the versatility the Bears' running backs posses. Addai proved to be reliable enough to score the winning touchdown against the Patriots, but he is a rookie. The Bear's defense will not fear him; middle linebacker Brian Urlacher will not allow it. 

Advantage: Bears.

The Bears defense was the most feared defense in the NFC this season. 

Unfortunately for the Bears, someone exposed their weakness during the playoffs: Seattle Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander. Alexander is the only proven offensive force the Bears faced during playoffs. He bullied the Bears for 108 yards and two touchdowns. 

In the NFC Championship game, the New Orleans Saints' offense struggled due to their most threatening playmakers being rookies. 

The Colts have a few notable veteran offensive forces, which together form a caliber of players the Bears have not seen.

 Despite injuries to All-Pro safety Mike Brown and All-Pro defensive tackle Tommie Harris, the defense is still good. But a good defense didn't win games for the Bears the season. A great one did.

During this year's playoffs, the Colts have decided to deviate from their usual routine: their defense has been winning games instead of Peyton Manning's arm. 

Their run defense was an atrocity during the regular season. Running backs of all sizes and speeds were slicing through the Colts like a knife slicing butter. That butter has transformed to titanium alloy the last three games. Perhaps the return of All-Pro safety Bob Sanders energized the team, but the Colts have managed to halt potent running backs, such as Larry Johnson, Jamal Lewis, Corey Dillon, and Lawrence Maroney. 

On paper, the Bears are superior on defense. Presently, the Colts have the better defense. The Colt's defense has much to prove just like Manning does. 

Advantage: Colts.

The Bears wide receivers mirror their running backs. They have a physical juggernaut in Muhsin Muhammad and burner Bernard Berrian. 

Nonetheless, Bob Sanders is back and Grossman is the Bears quarterback. Their performance will be hindered by Grossman's inaccuracy and the Bears running the ball every opportunity they can. 

The Colts receivers are savvy and Peyton Manning's familiarity with them will be paramount. 

Advantage: Colts.

The X-factors of the game are Bears rookie return man Devon Hester and tight end Dallas Clark. Devon Hester is familiar with the end zone; he has the ability to give the Bears momentum with one return. 

Dallas Clark was a factor versus the Patriots' old linebackers. His speed at the tight end position will be key to attracting Brian Urlacher's attention away from blitzing Manning and stopping the run. Because the Colts can punt the ball out of bounds, Hester can be neutralized. 

Advantage: Colts

 The Bears will be a good team for years to come.

However, Manning and the Colts will hoist the lombardi trophy in the city where Marino became a legend, but failed to win a ring.

Headline: Fuller's career day leads Golden Panthers to easy win over ASU
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you take a ride past the outdoor basketball complex near the University Park Apartments on any given night, something is sure to capture your attention - a 6'5" left-hander taking consecutive jump shots under the bright lights.

Although he is still regarded as the Golden Panthers' defensive stopper, junior guard Chris Fuller has been looking for his shot a lot more lately, and his career high 20-point performance led his team to a blow-out 80-61 win over Arkansas State (11-11, 6-4 SBC) Jan. 27 at Pharmed Arena.

The always-humble Fuller credits nothing more than his tireless work ethic for his offensive prowess of late.

"It's just really been a lot of hard work, to be honest. I have been putting in some extra work here and there and in the past couple games my confidence has gone up," Fuller said. "They are a great team, but I thought we just played a really good game. If we were shooting like that all season we would have won a lot more games. It's really hard to beat us when we shoot that well."

Riding Fuller's hot hand right from the opening tip, the Golden Panthers left Arkansas State at a standstill. After trading baskets early on, lead point guard Michael James went on a 5-0 run by himself to give the Golden Panthers some breathing room at 21-13 with 9:27 remaining in the half.

Fuller and forward Alex Galindo took turns drilling buckets. Over the next five minutes, the Golden Panthers went on a 13-5 run to give them their biggest lead of the game (34-18).

Meanwhile, the offensive struggles continued on the other end for Arkansas State. With the exception of Adrian Banks and his accomplice Isaac Wells, everybody else was ice cold from the perimeter en route to a dismal 8-24 (33 percent) first half shooting performance. Fuller was the lone player in double figures in the half, with 11, while Galindo just missed the mark with nine. 

The Golden Panthers held a comfortable 41-16 lead at intermission. However, they did cool off quite a bit in the second half. But luckily for them, Banks remained the lone offensive threat for Arkansas State. After going 5-for-8 in the first half, Fuller was just 1-for-6 from the field in the second, but made good on all seven of his free throw attempts.

Senior guard Johwen Villegas put up seven points in the half on 50 percent shooting to keep his team in the lead.  

As the game progressed, free throw shooting turned out to be a decisive factor. After shooting 7-for-11 from the line in the first half, the Golden Panthers made good on 18-of-19 second half free-throw attempts, while Arkansas State was 21-for-32 for the game. 

Villegas complimented Fuller's big game with 14 points, and Galindo chipped in with 11. James also put up 10 points in the win.

Fuller said he is proud of his teammates and how hard they have played in a stretch in which only eight players were suited up.

"I think adversity is what pulls us together. Being shorthanded we had to be even closer and depend on each other and a lot of guys have really grown up in the process," he said. "Our freshman players have really stepped up a lot and that says a lot. A lot of schools don't really ask their freshman to play big minutes but we had too and it's been working out."

Banks matched Fuller's performance with 20 points of his own, and swingman Shawn Morgan added 16 on 6-for-10 shooting.

A major spark for the Golden Panthers was the return of sophomore big man Marlon Bright, who returned back to action after suffering a concussion in practice two weeks ago.

Bright, who had six points and five rebounds in just nine minutes of action, seems to be well aware of his impact on his teammates.

"It really felt good to be back and I know that I could come back and make a difference. I don't think it was just what I did on the court but I think it was just knowing that they had another body out there supporting you that helped out a lot," Bright said. "Fuller and Galindo have really stepped it up lately both in the locker room and on the court and are really becoming the leaders that we know they are. Every year they come out and have played hard. Fuller has really been big for us and he is making the plays to carry you right now." 

 The 19-point victory was the biggest for the Golden Panthers in two years and ended a two-game skid with road losses against the Louisiana-Monroe and New Orleans. 

The Golden Panthers will look to stay on the winning track Feb. 1 on the road against Arkansas-Little Rock.

Headline: Pitching staff revamped, Walker assumes more responsibilities
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Following a tough year last season, this year's pitching staff is looking to establish themselves as one of the more dominant pitching staffs in the Sun-Belt conference.

Leading the staff is 6'6" senior right hander Walker Whitley.

Coaches say that Whitley's odd sidearm delivery gives him an advantage when he faces batters.

"He's almost a submarine guy; you just don't see that everyday. Hitters don't work on that in batting practice," assistant coach Chris Holick said. "He throws from a hard angle. Plus, being 6'6", his release point to the plate is he gets out, he gets extended, his ball has a lot of movement."

Whitley will be utilized this year out of the bullpen in big spots and possible Sunday starter.

Last season he threw a team-high 126.2 innings and posted a 4.33 ERA. 

"Instead of just spending the whole week waiting for your one game, one start and everything built-up for Friday, I had a set routine," Whitley said. "This year, it's more exciting because you show up to the ballpark knowing you might play everyday."

Although the season hasn't even started, the Golden Panthers will miss senior right hander Akeem Francis, who injured his arm while pitching for the U.S. Virgin Islands national team over the summer. 

They will also be without junior right hand pitcher Kyle Preshong, who also injured his throwing arm playing summer ball.

"Both those guys by conference should be ready. They should be 100 percent," Holick said.

Despite his injury and the shortcomings of last season, Francis believes this year's staff is much deeper than last year's has more potential.

"We have a more deep pitching staff. We have more pitching than we did last year," Francis said. "With the pitching and the hitting we get, we should be able to pull off a really good [season]."

Though injuries can hamper a staff that has all the potential in the world, coach Danny Price doesn't believe injuries should hamper a season's success.

"Those aren't problems, they're just management issues. You just have to deal with what you get. There's no built in excuse, I don't want to hear anything about excuses, excuses are just excuses," Price said. "Excuses to me mean nothing. That's why you got extra people. If one guy falls, someone else has to pick up the flag."

Among those picking up the flack will be junior right hander Chris Allen and freshman left hander Corey Polizzano. The two newcomers will be called on to shut down batters before handing the mound over to Whitley.

Besides the change in roles on the staff, coach Holick want to change the philosophy for the defense and pitching staff.

"We're going to work quick. There's not going to be too much delay between pitches. It's going to be something where the defense is on their heels the whole time," Holick said. "We're going to be ready and they're going to be prepared. It's not going to be a slow moving staff. We're going to throw strikes so the defense is alert."

Beyond the teams pitching depth and type of defense they will be playing, Price believes that the success of the season depends more on the entire team's efforts.

"Pitchers get wins and losses," Price said. "That's not the way it is. The team gets the wins and losses. We get the losses and wins together. It's not about who went 5-5 or 0-5. If you played or didn't play, we all win or we all lose."

Headline: Pan-African celebrations spark tensions
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
A list of scheduled events for this year's Pan-African Heritage Week celebration is causing some tension between black students and the Student Programming Council.

Students from several campus organizations, including the Black Student Union, the Haitian Student Organization and the Caribbean Student Organization, say they were not adequately involved in the celebration's planning.

"Everyone wanted to get involved because we're part of the African diaspora," said BSU President Will Hatcher.

Hatcher feels that the Pan-African Week celebrations should unify and uplift both native Africans and those of African descent, something he says this year's celebrations lack.

"The main issue we feel is that they don't have events that represent Pan-African Students," Hatcher said.

Another problem: the Pan-African calendar of events has changed several times, according to Hatcher.

In the first calendar, Hatcher saw an event called "Sex with Marilyn," taking place to promote sexual awareness and safety.

However, a similar event, the "Get Leid Carnival," taking place Feb. 12 and being co-sponsored by Women's Health Services, stayed on the calendar. The event's purpose is to be an educational session about diseases, abstinence and victim advocacy, according to the WHS.

Hatcher feels that events such as these do not fully represent the Pan-African community.

"There's really no culture in the culture celebration," he said.

According to Hatcher, there were no events promoting sexual awareness or health during the 2006 Hispanic Heritage celebration.

Hatcher also said that SPC did not let his organization know how much money was being set aside for the celebration, bringing up suspicions that the event was not as well allocated as other cultural celebrations.

However, Ayxa Barbel, the cultural celebrations chair for SPC, told The Beacon via e-mail that this year's budget for the Pan-African Week will be $17,718.06, almost $1,000 more than Fall semester's Hispanic Heritage budget of  $16,794.72.

She did nor provide an actual budget.

"The misconception is rooted [in] the Pitbull concert that occurred during Hispanic Heritage," Barbel wrote in the e-mail.

According to Barbel, the performance was not paid for by the Cultural Celebrations budget, but by the SPC president who used part of his contingency money after Pitbull's managers lowered the price.

"He is a local artist who did not require travel expenses and he had a new album that would come out just a few weeks after. His management realized this was an important opportunity and actually lowered what they normally charge," Barbel wrote.

Pitbull's performance was part of SPC's Concerts, Special Events and Campus Entertainment Fall events, not just Hispanic Heritage, and took place Oct. 19, 2006.

"Pitbull's concert was a matter of opportunity, timing and luck," Barbel wrote. 

She wrote she had no "premeditated malice toward making any other heritage celebration feel inferior."

"Many people believe [priority] is placed on Hispanic Heritage, but this is just not so," Barbel wrote.

Cultural Celebrations have been going on at FIU since the '80s, and SPC is in charge of programming each of the heritage weeks, which include Hispanic, Asian, American and Pan-African heritages.

In previous years, the celebrations were planned by a committee.

This year, Barbel was the sole planner.

Like Hatcher, Zakina Ogbourne, FIU graduate and past Pan-African chair member, is frustrated by the lack of culture in the events.

"Last year, we had an art show, Sunday brunch, a fashion show, dance and step performances, and Mardi Gras," Ogbourne said.

This year's fashion show was cancelled.

Headline: Student remembers famous grandfather
Author: Josh LePree / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With an aura of confidence and charisma, junior Mauricio de la Nuez sat down to talk about his grandfather, Alberto Diaz Gutierrez. Better known as "Korda," Gutierrez is the photographer behind "Guerrillero Heroico,"-Heroic Guerrila-the famous image of Ernest "Che" Guevara.

The meeting took place a few days after the documentary Kordavision, showcasing the life work of Korda, was screened and presented by director Hector Cruz Sandoval Jan. 24 at University Park.

De la Nuez is Korda's maternal grandson, "one of many", as he says, and came to Miami from Havana in 1995, at the age 12. He is a junior at FIU and is studying construction management.

He remembers having a close relationship with his grandfather, from whom he learned the art of photography at an early age.

Korda served as Fidel Castro's personal photographer for 10 years, beginning with the 1959 revolution. "Guerrillero Heroico" was snapped in 1960, but did not receive widespread recognition until the execution of Guevara in Bolivia, when Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli obtained the rights to publish Guevara's Bolivian diary with the intention of using the print he had already obtained from Korda for the cover of the diary. He later decided to publish the image as a large poster, and due partly to his decision, the photo has become what The Maryland Institute College of Art has deemed, "The most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of the 20th century."

De la Nuez seems to have taken after his grandfather.  

"He was, more than anything a family guy … who cared a lot about his relatives," de la Nuez said, with a nostalgic grin on his face. "He was a fun-loving person."

According to de la Nuez, though Korda was an avid supporter of Fidel's regime, he never put politics ahead of his professional endeavors.

"He would hardly ever talk politics," de la Nuez said.  "There was a time when Fidel told him "you should wear the green [military] fatigues of the revolution."

According to de la Nuez, Korda simply replied, "I am a photographer, not a soldier."

Korda was born in 1928 in Havana, and in 1956 opened a photography studio with his partner while Cuba was still under Fulgencio Batista's rule.

Korda's main interest at the time was fashion photography, and he was greatly influenced by the style employed by Hungarian filmmakers and photographers Zoltan and Alexander Korda, hence his decision to adopt their name for his studio.

Korda was a natural, and gifted, at the art of photography, despite his admission that, "My main aim [in photography] was to meet women."

Korda happened to be at the right place at the right time, and his natural talent and vision enabled him to capture perspectives of Cuban life that were unbeknownst to the rest of the world. 

In reality, Korda never received much credit as the photographer, and apparently never received much, if any, in the way of royalties of "Guerrillero Heroico." 

The photo has been reproduced with such regularity that it is recognized throughout the entire world and can be seen on T-shirts, mugs, posters, ashtrays, album covers, even billboards and corporate advertising campaigns.  

Perhaps his most famous image behind that of Che is a photo of an impoverished, unkempt young peasant girl gripping a small log that served as her doll; images such as these helped garner sympathy for Castro's revolution, even in the United States. 

Alberto Korda died in 2001 while presenting his work in Paris.

As de la Nuez took a deep breath, he entered into a state of reminiscence before summing up his grandfather's spirit and vision, "He always used to say this quote from The Little Prince: 'One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.'"

De la Nuez returned to Cuba on a regular basis to visit his family, including his grandfather, and recounts a vivid memory that helps to illustrate Korda's youthful heart: 

"One time, I went back to Cuba and was visiting my grandfather at his house, there was an attractive young girl at his house, and I was thinking to myself "Who is this girl?"  I began to talk with her, and after a short time she left.  After she departed, my mother came over to me and said, 'Be careful!  That is your grandfather's girlfriend!'" De la Nuez said throwing his hands up and cracking a "believe-it-or-not" expression.  

Apparently, Korda never forgot about his main aim in photography.

When asked about his feelings toward being the grandson of the photographer responsible for "the most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of the 20th century," de la Nuez sighed and said, "It's amazing that he is my grandfather."

Headline: Report: universities may go bankrupt
Author: Jose de Wit / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Florida's statewide university system has grown haphazardly and could find itself bankrupt and unable to meet the needs of a growing college-bound population unless it makes some urgent changes, according to a report presented before the Board of Governors at a meeting Jan. 24 and 25.

Though the report had been released to the media Jan. 18, this was the first time it was formally presented to and discussed by the Board of Governors and university presidents and administrators. 

The purpose of the report, according to John Dasburg, the board member who commissioned the report, is to provide a clear assessment of the state of Florida's public university system and to offer a blueprint for the system's growth over the next 30 years. 

According to Chancellor Mark Rosenberg, the system needs to grow, in some way or another, because university enrollment in Florida is expected to increase by more than 50,000 students by 2012. 

"The question is whether we will continue to grow by default, or by design," said John Hitt, president of the University of Central Florida.

Among those present, some liked what the report had to say, while others -including FIU President Modesto A. Maidique - were vocally opposed to its recommendations.

According to the report, Florida has too many universities that are investing too many resources in the attempt to become major research universities. Those resources are poorly spent, the report says, because few or none of those universities are likely to ever become major players at a national level.

Furthermore, these efforts are often at the expense of the quality of undergraduate education.

The report offers a list of recommendations to overhaul Florida's higher education system, though it warns that some universities may need to make difficult sacrifices. 

For example, a key recommendation was that Florida organize its universities in a tiered system, with two or three major research universities and large number of smaller, exclusively undergraduate state colleges.

In between, there would be a handful of universities that could grant graduate degrees, but would need to restrict their research to a small number of focused "niche" programs.

A university like FIU, for example, might have to restrict its research ambitions to three or four programs and dedicate the rest of its resources to undergraduate education.

If the report's recommendations are adopted, it would not be mandatory for individual universities to adopt measures like these.

Instead, financial incentives or "carrots," as the board referred to them all through the meeting, would be used to compel schools to comply.

The board would give priority to certain academic programs and policies, and universities who adopt them would receive additional funds from the Legislature. 

On the other hand, this could mean that the formula used to calculate the money each university receives each year would change.

As a result, universities that do not act to adopt the recommendations could see their funding decreased.

A school that decides to pursue research programs without the board's seal of approval could have to seek other, non-state funds to pay for them.

Funding policies like these would put major pressure on universities to play along with any measure prescribed by the board.

"I have been a university president, and I know the public good drove me some of the time, the good of the state drove me some of the time and even blind personal ambition drove me some of the time," said Stephen Portch, co-writer of the report. "But the funding system drove me most of the time. You play the funding game you are given."

The reaction of university presidents to the report's proposals varied, but Maidique was exceptionally outspoken against them. 

"If the word 'optional' weren't there, I'd be concerned," he said. "The bottom line is, no matter how big your carrot is, we don't want it."

Maidique said his concern is that getting rid of graduate programs would lower FIU's prestige.

"No 'state college' has a world-class school of medicine. It would be unfair to diminish the standing of a university and the value of its degree to its alumni," Maidique said. 

Most other university presidents disagreed, and were more receptive of the report's recommendations.

 "A first-class, four-year baccalaureate institution is of far more value than a second-rate research institution," said John C. Cavanaugh, president of the University of West Florida. 

Portch explained that although status is typically conferred to research universities, the issue is a question of quality versus status.

"A quality four-year institution can ultimately have as much prestige," Portch said.

"We have received a large number of interesting ideas about the future of Florida's higher education, and we're going to keep an open mind toward all of them," said Frank T. Brogan, president of Florida Atlantic University. 

Throughout the discussion, Rosenberg reminded everyone that the report is only "a starting point for a conversation, an invitation to a dialogue regarding the future of Florida's university system"

Headline: Women use game to reconnect with men
Author: Kelli Kennedy / AP Wire
&nbsp;
Super Bowl Sunday, once the manliest of annual celebrations, is getting a shot of estrogen.

Tired of being sidelined during football's holiest day, sports-savvy ladies are brushing up on their football lingo and planning couples activities to reconnect with their men, while other game widows will revel in a night of freedom.

"For single people, this has gotten as big as, 'Do I have a date for New Year's Eve?' There is hardly a soul that doesn't say what are you doing for the Super Bowl," sports lecturer Paula Duffy said.

The author of an audio book series, which includes the "Woman's Guide To Football," Duffy says her Long Beach, Calif.-based business is swamped once the playoffs start. She travels the country speaking at Tupperware parties, holding seminars at The Learning Annex, appearing on radio shows and even teaching private lessons, which cost upward of $250.

Duffy demystifies the rules of the game for clients, a mix of single and married gals and business ladies looking to connect with their colleagues, with graphics and cheat sheets.

"Sports and entertainment have blended. Coaches like Phil Jackson are rock stars. There's red carpet events," Duffy said of the growing glamour factor surrounding sports. "It's Access Hollywood meets ESPN and it's a genuine topic of gossip."

And a great way for single women to snag a guy, said Duffy, who estimates about 60 percent of her clients fall into that category.

Several professional and college football teams are also giving women the play by play. The Buffalo Bills host NFL 101 during preseason camp, which includes lessons on how to catch and throw and a tour of the locker room.

Jan Wannstedt, wife of University of Pittsburgh's coach Dave Wannstedt, leads Football University, a one-night introductory class for women. The Cincinnati Bengals and the Green Bay Packers also hold Football 101, where attendance is in the hundreds.

Gwen Arafiles, 23, was one of 600 women who attended the University of California at Berkeley's womens football huddle led by head coach Jeff Tedford last August.

"It was definitely fun. They had us practice kicking field goals from five different spots on the field," said Arafiles, a public relations executive from Berkley. "Afterward, I could say this is what a safety does. I can understand how a running back gets stripped of the ball."

But what about the women who don't care as much about the game, but still want the camaraderie?

Christine Cheng hosts a couples football and cooking party and hires a gourmet tailgating chef. The ladies learn to make mini Kobe beef burgers, salmon quesadillas, homemade sweet potato fries and crab cakes which they later serve the boys.

"The men love watching the game and being served gourmet foods and drinks; the ladies love having a cooking class and being with their men," said Cheng, a 25-year-old marketing director from Beverly Hills.

A Brooklyn spa is looking to keep the sparks flying long after the coin toss with four plasma screen TV's, food and a full bar for the men and chocolate massages and facials to entertain the ladies. When the game is over, couples can reunite in Body by Brooklyn's thermal hot tub or Turkish steam room.

Then there are the gals who are happy to thumb their nose at football's most sacred day. Seattle restaurant The Pink Door is throwing a "Superbelle event" in their honor, which includes a manicurist, Tarot card reader, trapeze artist and chick flicks.

DIYNetwork.com is planning a marathon airing "Knitty Gritty" and encouraging knitters to trade tips over the Internet as they make shawls and blankets for charity.

And for the gals who didn't plan for the sacred game, there's still time to brush up on game day etiquette. Even for those stymied by a first down, Los Angeles psychologist Robert Butterworth said there are a few rules to stay on speaking terms after the game.

Super Bowl Sunday is not the time for women to discuss financial matters, compare themselves to the cheerleaders or start a sentence with "You never talk to me," Butterworth said. And no matter what, don't vacuum during the game.

Headline: Driving While Distracted: Multi-tasking motorists defy obvious risk
Author: Chris Cabral / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
It's a cold, rainy February morning, You're driving down the street while talking on your cell phone.

Your girlfriend, who is in the process of breaking up with you, tearfully tells you that she has been cheating on you with a Spanish language television producer named Umberto. In your tear-filled misery, you fail to notice the vehicle up ahead. As you crash into the back of the ice cream truck, you hear the happy children's music over the sound of your own death rattle.

Has this ever happened to you? If you drive while distracted, you could be the next poor soul who loses their car or their life in a terrible accident, except chances are … there won't be any ice cream.

According to a study performed by the National Highway traffic safety administration in conjunction with Virginia Tech, nearly 80 percent of all car accidents occur within three seconds of a driver distraction. What's even more alarming is that drivers between the ages of 18 and 20 are four times more likely to end up in a car accident as a result of their lack of focus than drivers who are over the age of 35. Young people, with their "texting" and their music and their sense of immortality are putting their lives, and the lives of older drivers at risk.

Cell phone use was the most common distraction, but another common distraction was reading, the study found. Eating was also a common distraction. Cheeseburgers and Burritos can be delicious, but in the hands of a distracted driver, they can be deadly. Drivers may have to start asking themselves - is that Chalupa worth losing a life?

The answer may be surprising for those with much faith in America's youth. Upon questioning, a few students admitted to some dastardly deeds behind the wheel.

One student, Joshua Dobarganes, confessed to engaging in sexual activity in the 11th grade with his ex-girlfriend "Jessica Jacksonshire." 

"I received the intense gratification of oral amplification whilst piloting my automobile," Dobarganes said. It was quite a regurgitating experience!"  

Poor word choice notwithstanding, similar stories are common. Such lurid activities have been depicted in such films as Thinner, and the Academy-Award-winning films Monster and Crash. The title of that last film perfectly sums up what can happen when motorists attempt to drive while being fellated. 

Others didn't admit to much, but several told stories of drivers they have seen "acting a fool." Freshman Douglas Reilly told quite a tale. 

"This one time I saw this guy eating a burger. With both hands, just like (makes loud chewing noises)," Reilly said.  "I could see eating a fry or two but he was trying to eat his entire meal!"

These stories, however amusing and bizarre, are merely a few examples of some of the things people do behind the wheel. Beyond the more obvious examples of applying make-up and cell phone use, there are countless other activities that can distract drivers, including billboards. In a story in the Washington Post, columnist Marc Fisher commented on a new campaign meant to stop inattentive driving: "the city has decided to try another way to send the message about distracted driving: Billboards. Billboards you look up at while you are … driving."  The ads, featuring intricate displays of activities drivers shouldn't engage in, highlight another distraction drivers should be wary of.

All jokes aside, lack of focus while behind the wheel is a major cause of fatal accidents, and the lives lost in these accidents are nothing to laugh at. Driving while inattentive can be just as dangerous as driving while intoxicated. Motorists would be wise to put down the cell phone, drop the burger and reject their spouse's sexual advances. In the words of that attention-grabbing billboard: "Distracted Drivers Kill!"
