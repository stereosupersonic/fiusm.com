Headline: Track preparing for Sun Belt Championship
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As at most schools across the nation, cross country has taken a backseat to football, soccer, and volleyball as we make our way through the fall season. 

This year's team is using scheduled race meets as a stepping-stone toward the culmination of all of the season's hard work, the Sun Belt Conference Championship meet on Oct. 30. 

Coach Steve Rubin is looking forward to having his team make a difference at track meets.

"Last year we were a none factor at most meets," said Rubin. "This year we're serving notice that this very young team is moving up fast."

Having only had seven runners on the men's roster last year, three of whom were freshmen and two sophomores, a last place finish was all but unavoidable.  

This year, thanks to the recruitment efforts of assistant coach Carlos Savat, the team is 20 runners deep, all of whom are competing for the seven race spots. 

As Rubin states, "The atmosphere has completely changed."

The women's team on the other hand is simply looking to be as dominant as they were a year ago; a season, that saw them finish a solid third in the conference. 

"Last year was a tremendous year for the ladies," Rubin said. "It marked the first time they really became competitive as a team." 

The ladies went on to compete for the first time at the NCAA regional championships where they finished 20th, behind such teams as SEC and ACC powerhouses Tennessee and Florida State. 

Coming into this season, the hope was for Amanda Howard to step up as the number one runner in place of Rebecca Rodriguez who graduated last year. 

The team also  needs incoming freshmen to step up right away.

 "[We need freshman to] quickly [develop] and acclimate to college level racing," Rubin said.

There is no doubt in anyone's mind that they have matured, having won their opening meet at the FIU Invitational and having placed eighth at the Gator Invitational. 

The men's and women's teams that represent FIU at the Disney Classic will most likely be the same as the ones that will feature at the conference meet, barring injuries. 

"Our main five for the ladies [team] will be Amanda Howard, Katherine Cardenas, Paola Reategui. Apryl Wall, and Deirdra Witherspoon. For the guys it'll be Noel Delgadillo, DJ Keller, Rob Castillo, Rene Rodriguez and Jon Trujillo," insists Rubin. 

Only time will tell how far these two teams can go.  

Coach Steve Rubin puts it best, "If we can stay healthy, I'm confident that Coach Salvat's training plan will produce something exiting in Little Rock on Oct. 30."

Headline: Women's soccer player makes comeback from injury in time for conference game
Author: Ana Sanchez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After making a remarkable recovery from a collarbone injury, Whitney Rezendes made her way back onto the soccer field this season, after being diagnosed as out for the year. 

With the help of daily therapy and her relentless attitude, Whitney surprised everyone when she returned in time for the Sun Belt Conference games this season. 

Rezendes did not injure herself playing soccer. The injury came during a skateboarding accident.

"It was a silly injury, it made me want to come out here more to show that I can play soccer and not just mess around,"  Rezendes said. 

She will keep the soccer playing to a minimum during the season because  according to Rezendes it's easy to get hurt. 

Recovery was painful, having to deal with back problems but she felt ready to play. Watching her teammates from the sidelines and wanting to play motivated her to achieve an early recovery commented Whitney. 

At the early age of five, Rezendes' parents placed her in an indoor soccer league and she hasn't left the sport since. She was recommended to play for FIU by teammate Valerie Patrick, who also played with Whitney in Arapahoe High School in Littleton, Colorado. 

"Valerie recommended me to play for the FIU soccer team. I came down for a visit and I liked it, so I stayed," Rezendes said.

Coming to FIU, Rezendes has received the opportunity to work with 20-year veteran Head Coach Everton Edwards.

"Edwards taught me how to use my energy on the field, how to make the right runs and how to be checking where the ball is at all times," Rezendes said.  

Rezendes' main goal this season is scoring goals for the team in order to help the team advance to the NCAA Championships. She is proud of the two Sun Belt Conference wins the team has picked up because the chemistry of players is coming around well.

 "Our confidence is high, we have gotten to know each other and we are playing better," Rezendes said.

Her confidence becomes evident when she tells herself during games that she is going to score goals.

 "It helps. I always tell myself that in a game there is no time to think about anything else, it's not a good thing if your mind is wandering."

Working hard on the field is important to Rezendes who believes that working hard affects other people and makes them work hard too. 

With enthusiasm smile, Rezendes proudly says, "I believe we can definitely win the conference so that we can get into the NCAA Tournament."

Headline: Adventures in financial aid hell
Author: Jose Aparicio / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Financial aid. Did I get your attention? The highly efficient personnel at FIU decided that I could not acquire my financial aid until after Sept. 30. I think it's nice of them to help me out like that.

Long story short: I no longer qualify for government Stafford loans or rather FIU doesn't seem to think that they should give me this money. Apparently, because of what I did eight years ago, they think I will squander the money, drop out and waste my life.

I am glad they know what is best for me. 

To be perfectly honest, I don't know why I don't get to receive the money I spent an hour and a half applying for on-line. The government sent me an e-mail, followed by a letter, which told me that I qualified for two thousand dollars in financial aid. But again, because of the mistakes of my past, and a low GPA which is inaccurate FIU doesn't want to give me the money. 

     Instead, I called my bank and asked them if they had any loans available for students. They informed me about a  private group that gives out  student loans and told me that  I should call them. They wouldn't give me a loan either. 

So, I did what any rational, young adult would do. I  desperately took my tears to my mother. She agreed to co-sign a loan for me and I was in the clear. The bank told me they would send a letter to FIU notifying them of my loan and that FIU would then send a confirmation that they had recovered the letter. Great, right? 

Imagine my dismay when I registered for classes and learned that FIU had yet to send the confirmation that they had received my bank's letter.

I proceeded to call FIU's Financial Aid Office, and after leaving me on hold for 20 minutes, someone picked up and transferred me and then someone else just plain hung up on me. 

Now, due to FIU censorship, I cannot repeat the thoughts that ran through my head after being on hold for 20 minutes only to have someone hang up on me. Afterwards, I counted to ten and went down to the Financial Aid Office. 

Thoughts of how glad I was to have applied so early to avoid this ran through my head. I looked at the bitter angry faces of people waiting with similar problems.

Let me skip ahead to the third time I had to wait in line to explain  my situation to someone for the fourth time. The conversation went like this:

Me: "All I need is for you (FIU) to send out a confirmation to my bank. They've told me they have sent you the request three times."

Competent employee: "Your GPA is too low. We can't send it out. Maybe you want to try to apply for a loan through Citi Financial, they don't look at GPA."

Me: "Yeah I know. They've (FIU) told me that three times already. I checked with my bank. They don't look at GPA. Please just send the confirmation."

Competent employee: "Well..."

Me: "Look, here is their number. They told me you can call them. If they don't receive this confirmation, I will lose my loan and will not be able to attend your fine institution of higher learning.

 At this point the competent FIU employee became disgruntled and walked away. 

 When she came back twenty minutes later she told me that someone was sending the confirmation letter to my bank we spoke. At which point I informed her that the Financial Aid Office had told me the exact same thing three times before and that I wasn't leaving her office until I got some kind of confirmation that someone was indeed taking a break from their game of solitaire on the computer and faxing the proper papers to the bank. 

 She gave me her name and phone number and told me that I could contact her directly if there were any problems. 

 By the second week of school, the bank had indeed received FIU's letter of confirmation and sent them the total of my loan to cover my tuition. I called FIU and asked them for the remainder of my money to buy books. At which point they told me I couldn't have that money until the final drop date of Sept. 30. 

  It's a good thing FIU cares so much that I don't drop out and take the money that I will have to pay back either way. 	     You would think that with the fiscal responsibility of starting a law and a medical school, they would take their money and run. 

But I should get my money this month, at which point I'll be living on the street.

After all this trouble, at least I'll have a solid education... that is, if I can hear my teacher over the bouncing balls in the gym, where my English class is held.

Headline: Dinner is served
Subheadline: Slob learns dining etiquette at practice dinner
Author: News Editor
&nbsp;
The salad fork goes to the right of the dinner fork, but the salad knife goes to the left of the dinner knife. Fold your napkin under the table. Chew with your mouth closed.

The rules of formal dinner etiquette have been largely ignored by most people in this country, perhaps because their complexity often demands the use of diagrams, maps and lengthy charts - I know, because I lazily tend to ignore those rules myself.

In an effort to gain some of those long-forgotten manners, I attended the annual Business Etiquette Dinner sponsored by SGA and Career Services on Oct. 6, a $20 event which tries to reform working-type slobs like me who can't tell the difference between a white wine or red wine glass.

The event - held in a well decorated Graham Center conference room - consisted of a six course meal served to 88 attending students dressed in their formal best. 

From the warm minestrone soup served as appetizer to the main course of chicken and rice (or 'Coq au Vin with Rice Pilaf,' as the menu stated, imitating what might eventually be encountered at a high-class restaurant), the food proved to be superb and of a high quality. The only problem was the timing of the service; being that the dessert éclairs did not find their way to our tables till three hours after the start of the event.

Between long waits for the next plate, Elena Brouwer, a certified ettiquette and protocol expert, kept the audience informed through a training lesson designed to explain the million rules involved with being polite at a business dinner.

"A person with good etiquette is a person who shows he or she is in control, a person who shows responsibility," she said during an introduction regarding the importance of good manners.

Illustrating her lecture with personal anecdotes, the well-groomed Brouwer told of the businesswoman who threw her fork across the room in a drunken state, of having to adjust to the extremely late night meals held by other cultures and other such tales that helped to perk up the sometimes dull atmosphere. She responded well to the many questions students asked, personally walking from table to table to demonstrate the proper way to propose a toast or scoop rice onto a fork.

By the end of my meal, I found myself confident in the ability to eat in front of an audience during highly formal events, picking up such random facts as the true purpose of sorbet along the way (that it helps clean the palette between courses). 

The dinner, held once a semester at UP, is an event all business-oriented students should make an effort to attend whether or not they know the difference between a red or white wine glass.

Headline: Horror Nights attracts masses with country-themed haunted houses
Author: Luis Nin and Xavier Villarmarzo / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Seductive vampires greeted us at the entrance. As we made our way into the park we held our breath as we were enveloped by thick fog. The low visibility definitely set us on edge. We had been to Halloween Horror Nights before and knew about the costumed freaks around every corner just waiting to jump out and scare us. 

As the fog parted, there stood three alien-like monsters. These 10-foot-tall, leather-clad abominations towered over the crowd and projected ominous threats and warnings into a loud-speaker. One of them leaned down to a huddled group of extremely scared young women and said in a demonic voice, "Your friends lead you to your doom!" 

The girls laughed uncomfortably, kept their distance from the monster and continued to walk through the park's main entrance. Halloween Horror Nights XIV was off to a great start.

Halloween Horror Nights is Universal Studios' annual Halloween event, held from Oct. 1 to Oct. 31. This year Halloween Horror Nights is better than ever. Usually the event takes place in either Universal Studios or Islands of Adventure. This year the event has expanded into both parks with seven all-new haunted houses and four fear zones. It is definitely the largest Halloween Horror Nights so far.

There was a marked improvement in the size of crowds and the length of the lines. Even the most popular haunted houses had only a 40-minute wait. Spreading the haunted houses across two parks seriously reduced congestion. Even a popular ride, like The Dueling Dragons, took only five minutes of waiting in line. Apparently almost everyone was queued up for the  haunted houses.

The haunted houses were masterfully done. Castle Vampyr, a vampire themed haunted house, employed amazing visual effects to simulate gravity-defying feats. The monsters in Castle Vampyr weren't like any of the other monsters across the park; they walked on walls and popped out of the most unexpected places.

Ghost Town, a haunted house with a Western theme, also showed an unbelievable attention to detail. You could smell the cow manure and feel the ground squishing beneath your feet as you passed through the barn. We were completely immersed in the atmosphere.

Every haunted house had a special theme and was distinct from the others. Disorientorium was truly original and unbelievably disturbing. 

Nestled on Super Hero Island by Doom's Terror Drop and probably one of the more difficult haunted houses to find, it was definitely one of our favorites. The most memorable feature was its hall of mirrors with demonic clowns lurking in the nooks and crevices. Disorientorium strived to confuse our visual perceptions. 

The only haunted house that was truly disappointing was Deadtropolis. This zombie-themed haunted house had a lot of potential. It used an urban setting to simulate a zombie outbreak but ultimately left a lot to be desired.  Unfortunately, it just didn't have nearly enough zombies.

 Zombies are only scary when there are a lot of them. Walking through Deadtropolis, we  occasionally encountered a few  zombies. There was never a point where they swarmed us. 

These lonely zombies didn't even pop out at us; they mostly just stood there and drooled. Deadtropolis looked stiff compared to the other haunted houses Halloween Horror Nights had to offer.

While this year is a big improvement over the previous years, one complaint has plagued Halloween Horror Nights since its inception back in 1990: Their haunted houses are just too crowded. Every haunted house is just an extension of the line outside. There is no feeling of solitude or isolation. 

Being alone in a deserted environment would've definitely made everything more frightening. As we walked through the houses, more than three quarters of the scares were used on the people in front of us. 

The flow of people through the house make everything feel rushed. It's almost an impossible problem to remedy for such a popular event. 

It looks like this problem is going to stick. If they decide to separate everyone into small groups the lines will be unbearable. 

Despite this one complaint, Halloween Horror Nights is definitely an event worth visiting, especially this year. 

There's nothing that brings people closer together like seeing their close friends completely freak out after a scary rock creature instantaneously pops out of a wall, so be sure to bring them along.

Headline: Coffee crowds enjoy warm, soothing tastes of Carribean café

&nbsp;
For just $20, you and a date can escape to a Caribbean paradise. The natives, wearing a smile that could melt the ice off the Grinch's heart, welcome all visitors to the Kola Nut Café. Once you've entered this getaway, the aroma of mouth-watering meals waft a tantalizing breeze in your nostrils. 

Your mouth waters at the thought of what is to come. Then it arrives: A plate of pure poetry and visual art. The dark reds and rich browns of the rice and peas sprinkled with coconut essence stand in stark contrast to the vibrant greens and yellows of the grilled vegetables. 

All are arranged meticulously inside a half moon of tomato and lettuce salad, misted with a light vinaigrette. The oxtail stew, the main focus of this dish, delights your sense of taste. My compliments to the chef.

The owners of the Kola Nut Café, Anthony and Regina Hall and Tony Amos have created a mirage, an escape from the bustling street of Miami Gardens Drive. 

The Kola Nut Café stands out from the city bus hub and the hulking warehouses with its sangria-colored shell. "The truck drivers come in here all the time," said Regina Hall. 	

I had the pleasure of chatting with Hall before, during and after my meal. Between forkfuls of peas and rice, she told me how the idea developed for the Kola Nut Café. 

"We wanted to do something Caribbean with a South American fusion, not specifically Jamaican," she said. "When people think of a Jamaican restaurant, they think of a takeout. People come here and we let them know they can get takeout, but they wind up staying." 

After experiencing the relaxed environment of the restaurant, I can understand why. The Kola Nut Café has the most beautiful orange and lime sherbet colored walls that blend effortlessly with the earth tone pumpkin and mustard colored floor. The soft red lighting and the cherry wood tables add to the neo soul décor.  

 Aside from serving food that will keep you coming back for more, the Kola Nut Café holds different events open to the public throughout the week. 

On some nights a DJ spins the latest jams as well as "oldies but goodies" in reggae and soca. There are often live jazz band performances, comedy shows and a Gospel brunch takes place. Fitting with the ambience of the Kola Nut Cafe, there is a spoken word exhibition as well.

The Kola Nut Café is the perfect place for college students to impress their date with their taste in restaurants. The vast menu has something for everyone and is easy on the budget.  For those who live on the Biscayne Bay Campus, one could easily hop on the 83 bus and go straight there.

Headline: Move over Dolphins, Marlins
Subheadline: With the elimination of the Marlins and the struggles of the Dolphins, thank goodness Shaq season is here
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Four straight losses for Fins, Marlins out of the playoffs and Dave Wannstedt is still head coach; my heart, along with every other fan in Miami, can't wait for the Miami Shaq season to get on its way. 

I never imagined the Miami Dolphins would have been this bad, even after Ricky Williams retired, considering the Super Bowl caliber defense the team has on its side. I still thought the team would be competitive enough to fight for a wild card spot.

Training camp opened last week for the Heat and expectations are as high as ever after numerous championship guarantees by center, Shaquille O'Neal. 

The Marlins, our only professional championship team in the last thirty years, came up short this season, after showering themselves with champagne last year following the defeat of the New York Yankees. The team was unable to repeat the magic and is currently sitting at home watching the playoffs.

Losing Pudge Rodriguez was the main reason the Marlins couldn't get it together. I talked to Mike Lowell a couple of months ago and he told me he will stay with the team if it stays competitive. 

That will be tough considering that 18-game winner Carl Pavano and catcher Paul Lo'Doca could command more than eight million a season.

Our beloved Dolphins team is playing so bad that the University of Miami football team could probably defeat them. The coaching and managerial skills of Dave Wannstedt have finally come to haunt the team. The offensive unit of the Dolphins has given away more touchdowns than they have scored.

Wannstedt is one of the most conservative coaches on offense and that will never get the Dolphins toward a Super Bowl appearance. Last game the team was playing so badly that the New York Jets, owner Wayne Huzienga should have sent a message on the public announcing system before the end of the third quarter that said: "Due to the circumstances the team is facing, Head Coach Dave Wannstedt has been fired and will not coach the remainder of the game."

The Dolphins are playing so badly that the team should put Shaq as a running back and Josh Beckett as a quarterback. Heck, the team's quarterbacks are so bad that Dan Marino on a wheelchair could probably throw better.

Thank god the Heat season starts in November. With the way Dwayne Wade played last year, and with the addition of Shaq, the team could compete for a spot in the NBA finals. 

News from the Heat training camp is that Shaq has lost over 30 pounds and is in the best shape he's been in since 1996. The Heat have placed quality veterans around the Big Aristotle.

Considering the weak division the Heat is in, it should have no problem winning. Shaq has mentioned how he hopes to help make Wade and Rasual Butler two of the better players in the game.

It's only October and I can't wait for the Dolphins season to end. Dolphin and Marlins jerseys are currently put away in the darkest corner of the messiest drawer and Shaq jerseys are hanging proud. 

Thank god Shaq is around this year because it should prove to be a "Heatnin" good season.

Headline: War defended despite report
Author: Warren P. Strobel and Matt Stearns / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
The Bush administration launched a campaign Sept. 7 to blunt the effect of a report that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction by arguing that its findings still justify the decision to invade Iraq.

President Bush said the report by chief U.S. weapons inspector Charles Duelfer shows that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was manipulating the United Nations' oil-for-food program to gain influence with countries that could help him lift U.N. economic sanctions.

"He was doing so with the intent of restarting his weapons program, once the world looked away," Bush said in his first comments on the report, which found Saddam had no stockpiles of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and no concrete programs to make them.

"Based on all the information we have today, I believe we were right to take action, and America is safer today with Saddam Hussein in prison," the president said.

But Bush also made his most emphatic statement yet on his administration's error, saying Duelfer's findings show that U.S. and allied intelligence on Iraq's weapons "was wrong."

Duelfer concluded that Saddam hadn't restarted his nuclear weapons program, had destroyed biological and chemical weapons stocks, and had hoped to eventually redevelop such weapons to deter neighboring Iran and enhance his regional power, not to attack the United States, as Bush and his aides claimed.

Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, charged Thursday that the report showed that Bush had "fictionalized" the threat from Saddam. The White House, Kerry said, was in "absolute full spin mode" over its findings.

Duelfer said dozens of influential world figures and some American companies were given the right to buy specific quantities of Iraqi oil below world market prices. They could resell these rights at a profit.

Among those who received these rights, according to Duelfer, were Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri and Charles Pasqua, France's interior minister.

By awarding these rights, Saddam was hoping to get their help to lift sanctions against his regime, according to Duelfer's report.

Campaigning in Florida, Vice President Dick Cheney highlighted the Duelfer report's finding that Saddam had siphoned off billions of dollars from the U.N. oil-for-food program and hoped to bribe other countries.

"As soon as the sanctions were lifted, he had every intention of going back to business as usual" and restarting the weapons programs, Cheney told the press at a special town hall meeting of supporters in Miami.

"So delay, defer, wait was not an option."

Headline: Professor discusses Kerry, Bush weaknesses
Author: Amanda Ramírez Castañeda / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
During a time when the general public is buzzing with news concerning the presidential elections, the FIU faculty held a symposium lunch on Oct. 7 with the theme "Terror Election? Bush vs. Kerry."

The speaker was Dr. Nicol C. Rae, Professor and Chairperson of Political Science at FIU, who shared his ideas on how the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center changed the dynamics of politics in America. Also of importance was the current war in Iraq as the topic that will determine who will be elected as the nation's next President.

According to Rae National security is the main concern, contrary to previous years when controversial social issues such as abortion rights and stem cell experimentation carried great weight on the general voters' decisions.  

Rae explained that, based on these theories and the candidates' positions regarding the war in Iraq, the most probable situation would be the reelection of President George Bush.

"The issue of terrorism seems to help the Republicans who usually have better votes in regards to national security," he said.

According to Rae, Kerry will not win the election by telling voters that the U.S. troops should leave Iraq as soon as possible because the people will vote for someone who is able to win the war effectively. Also Rae commented that  because Kerry maintains that the war is a mistake, will be very difficult for him to prove that he can win it.

"Kerry has to convince voters that he can actually fight better than Bush.  His backbone doesn't particularly make him well suited to do that," he said.

Rae later referred to Kerry as "a dove" when talking about the candidate's "consistent political career."

In his lecture, Rae stated that he found Kerry's nomination surprising considering his voting history. 

"Republicans are going to bring-up the issue of Kerry's voting records.  Kerry has consistently voted against wars, for example, the Gulf War.  Maybe the Democratic Party would have been better suited to elect someone different for this particular election."

On various occasions, Rae explained to his listeners that, growing up in the U.K., terrorism was a constant preoccupation in his daily life and that, personally, he is uncomfortable with the whole war-on-terror idea.  

"You can't actually win a war on terrorism.  You can make life difficult for the terrorists but you cannot actually declare victory," Rae said. 

He added that we'll most likely  see groups trying to commit terrorism acts for some time.

Rae reminded his audience that "election is all about winning the Electoral College" and that this is the reason why most of the country is not on the presidential campaign routes.  He stated that, in the Electoral College, Bush is ahead by 44 votes.  That means that Kerry would have to win most of the "toss-up" states in which poll numbers are too close to put either Bush or Kerry ahead at this point.  

The fear of a national conscription also came up during the lecture.  Rae explained that that situatuion is very unlikely to occur in the future because he believes the military doesn't have a valid argument for reinstating one.

"A disconnection from Iraq is more likely than a draft, and I've never been convinced that more troops in Iraq will make the difference," he said.

Rae assured the audience that, despite the change in American politics due to terrorism, he believes that, with time, elections will return their focus to the various topics that have been underplayed in these elections.  

"The impact of terror has already been receding and will continue to recede.  Indeed, I hope that that is the case," he explained, "It is possible that the war on terror can be contained and people will be back to not being afraid."

Headline: Symbolic torch remains unlit
Author: By Cristela Guerra / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
According to most Student Alumni Association and Student Government members, the new academic year began with a spark: the beginning of "Trail of the Torch," an event meant to forever ignite the unused Ernest Graham Torch of Service in the FIU University Park campus.

The spark, however, did not last long. Due to problems with funding, hurricane threats and a lack of student interest,  the torch ceased to burn in less than a month, remaining unused and unnoticed between Primera Casa and the Graham Center.

The original lighting event, held Sept. 1 as a candle procession from The Cage to the back of GC, drew 250 students and faculty members despite slight winds and rain.

A massive flyer campaign preceded the event, which included speeches by  University Park SGA President Jorge Rosario and Ty Javenalle, president of the FIU Alumni Association, along with a post-procession foam party.

To maintain this proposed tradition, SGA allotted a budget of $6,500 for advertising and any other necessities required for the torch. Still, some feel this was not enough.

"When you're establishing something this big, the marketing campaign is what takes up a large part of the sum.  We had t-shirts, cups, flyers, posters and of course, the food and foam party," said Randy Mora, the SGA's Honor's College representative, who was involved in the early summer planning of the event.

Bryon Tompkins, SGA representative from the College of Arts and Sciences and one of the originatots of the relighting idea, admits that, despite the budget they had been given, it was not enough to fully maintain the daily flame-for this to happen, $350 must be spent each week for the rest of the year. 

For now, being that the budget does not allow it, plans might be in store for other projects dealing with the Torch of Service.

"I hope to see it as a continual tradition at FIU, and perhaps later keep it lit year round," Tompkins said, referring both to the torch and to the Trail event planned to relight it every year.

Another key factor in the permanence of the flames is student interest.

According to Mora, to see the torch lit for the whole year would require the support of the university student body.

For some, this would not be a problem. 

"I think it was a good idea...what I did get from it was that I [saw] a passing of the torch from one generation to another. It gives you a sense of motivation, to improve and make things better," said Ronni Cadogan, a junior.

Still, despite the heavy promotions that led to the implementation of the idea, other students state that any concern for the torch might not be entirely felt.

"It's difficult to go to events like that, meant to represent something important and meaningful, but then not know its significance," said Bill Buchanan, a freshman and political science major.

"They should have gone more into its history and purpose."

The threat of being struck by three different hurricanes in a span of one month also did much to deter the maintanance of the torch.

The winds caused by Hurricanes Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, each closely following each other's path, blew the fire off the torch on several occassions, preventing the torch from being relit. 

The symbolic torch (its full title being the Torch of Knowledge, Service, and Understanding) has occasionally been lit since its dedication in 1972 to the memory of the late Senator Ernest Graham who passed legislations that eventually led to the approval of the university.

Originally, though, the founders of the school had intended to keep the fires of the monument burning on a continual basis, a token for both memory of the man which it honors and for the values it was intended to represent.

Its image can be currently found gracing the left side of the university's shield, the FIU symbol most widely seen and recognized.

 Also,  it is the namesake for the FIU Torch Society, an organization composed of the school's highest benefactors.

The Torch Awards, also named after the symbol, is a recognition annually given to members of the faculty and alumni who have made important contributions to their respective professions, fields of research, the community, or the university itself.

Jorge Rosario could not be reached for comment.
