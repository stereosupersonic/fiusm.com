Headline: Healthy eating options found on, near campus
Author: Sandra Mateu / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
To Yolanda Santisteban, a nurse practitioner at the Biscayne Bay Campus' student health clinic, the eating habits of young adults today are concerning. 

"Students are eating whatever they can get in a short amount of time and for a low price without caring about what they are eating," Santisteban said. 

While choosing a place to eat on or off campus may be a hassle for some students due to time and money, Santisteban said quality should be the main factor to consider. 

"More than picking where you eat, the key element is to pick what to eat," Santisteban said.  

There are many places on and off BBC that offer healthy choices within their high cholesterol and high sodium menus. 

The BBC's cafeteria on the second floor of the Wolfe University Center has juices, salad bar, fruits, yogurts, and sushi that can be part of a healthy meal.

For quick snacks, the campus offers Freshens Smoothies, which provides juices, fruits, salads, yogurts and parfaits. The vending machines on campus also have nut mixes with dried fruits, cereal bars and healthy snack bars. 

On campus, Subway offers a healthy menu that includes the six grams of fat or less, six-foot long sandwiches and salads. Off campus, on Biscayne Boulevard, Subway offers additional choices such as soups, yogurts, apple slices and raisins.

Kenid Joseph, a journalism senior, eats at Subway to keep her body in good health.

"[I] normally have a salad or one of their heart healthy sandwiches," Joseph said, "They have this nutrition guide and I just basically follow it because it tells me how many calories I'm taking in." 

Although Joseph is not on a diet, she has lost six pounds so far by eating healthy and going to the gym on campus.

"I call it a lifestyle change because I want to keep my body in good health," said Joseph.

Off campus there is Starbucks Coffee and Jamba Juice. Although these places offer products that are high on sugar and carbohydrates, they also offer healthy food choices. 

Jamba Juice, off of 135th Street and Biscayne Boulevard, offers healthy choices with the option of adding boosts to the drinks. These boosts are uniquely formulated to contain vitamins, minerals and functional ingredients blended to meet ones' personal health, according to JambaJuice.com. 

Starbucks Coffee provides different milk options and the choice of adding whipped cream or not. 

They offer a variety of options for those who are counting calories, watching fat and sugar intakes or looking for more fiber and whole grains, according to Starbucks.com. 

Heather Walker, a public relations senior, keeps her health in mind when eating.

"I try to eat as healthy as often as I can, but I don't always succeed," Walker said. "One of my weaknesses is a caramel frappucino with whipped cream."

Overall, Walker doesn't worry about her weight.

"I don't consider myself to be underweight or to be overweight," Walker said. "At 130 lbs I'm comfortable. I do think that I need to excersice though."

Restaurants near campus have healthy menus included in their regular menus. 

Friday's offers a healthy low carb, low fat menu that comprises appetizers, meals and even desserts aside from the regular menu's salads and soups. 

Pasha's is another health conscious restaurant that has been recognized by several awards including "Best Place to eat if On South Beach Diet" by The Sun Post in 2004, "Best Healthy Fast Food" by Miami New Times in 2005, and "Best Healthy Fast Food" by The Sun Post in 2005. Their menu includes salads, soups and wraps.

Einstein Bros. Bagels, on 135th Street and Biscayne Boulevard, lists their nutritional guide on their Web site, www.einsteinbros.com. They offer salads and soups as alternatives for those watching their carbohydrate intake. 

Santisteban also shared tips that can help healthy eaters when eating out such as asking for low-calorie foods, choosing oil and vinegar instead of house dressing and choosing vegetables instead of fried potatoes.

She also recommends bringing lunch from home.

"You need to prepare what you are going to eat. Do your homework!" Santisteban said. "See what your body needs according to your activities, the prices and labels; try to find easy, healthy and economic recipes."

Headline: Colbert assures patriotism increase after his read
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A new book by a college favorite for the presidency has recently been published. No, not Barack Obama's "The Audacity of Hope," but Stephen Colbert's "I am America (And So Can You!)."

It is difficult for supporters of Colbert to pass by the book on a shelf and not purchase it, especially considering its endorsement by the "Stephen T. Colbert Award for the Literary Excellence. 

Colbert has plenty of supporters. The Facebook group "Colbert for President" has more than 32,000 members, which isn't bad for someone who is not even running (except as a joke in his home state).  

So, he is popular, but is his latest parody of works by political pundits worth the read?

Inside the book jacket, the best of the comic gem; you get what you expect from Colbert and nothing more.

In typical style of a Bill O'Reilly book, Colbert sections up his work into chapters that cover all aspects of American life, from "The Family," "Old People" to "Religion." He also explains why you need to live your life his way or go to Hell.  

Colbert often invokes God as rationale for following the concepts in his book; the deity even makes an appearance in a sidebar entitled "Stephen Speaks for Me" in which the Almighty praises Colbert for the excellent chapter on religion.

The other underlying theme is how doing everything Colbert tells you will make you a better American. In fact, opening the cover of the book will make you "25 percent more patriotic," according to Colbert.

The book is amusing. Colbert's self-serving diatribes including how Protestantism is "a form of Christianity, or heresy" are always good for a laugh, and the book even comes with stickers with phrases such as "How True" and "Nailed It!" so you can mark where, specifically you think Colbert was right.

Such a book would be nothing without pictures, charts and diagrams and "I Am America" is rife with these including a visualization of "Abstinence Bases" where rather than intercourse, home plate is "furious dry humping."  And, as if Colbert and writers could not stuff enough humor into the 230 pages, each page also has footnotes and margin notes with even more jokes.

If you are a die-hard Colbert fan who has followed him since "The Daily Show" or if you don't follow Colbert often and need to be acquainted with his sense of humor, buy his book.

But, if you'd rather save $20, you can watch him on Comedy Central nightly and get pretty much the exact same content and you won't have to read, either.

Headline: MSL: Music club trades blood for concert tickets
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This past summer five dedicated FIU students began scripting a constitution and a mission statement; working toward approval from the Student Organization Council to get their club going. In August the students got what they wanted and a branch of Music Saves Lives (MSL) was created at FIU.

A former Red Cross employee and avid music fan, Russel Hornbeek, founded Music Saves Lives in November 2005. His intention was to gather people based on a common interest, music, who are willing to donate blood to patients and prolong their lives.

Two years have passed and the organization has found its way to some high schools and colleges.

According to Vice President Rosalyn Delgado, MSL is a concept of merging service with music in order to come together for a common cause, whether it is to raise funds for cancer research, have bone marrow registry drives for DKMS Americas or simply just to bring members and the music community together. 

The club's first unofficial event was a one week blood drive where donors had the opportunity to donate and receive one free concert ticket and all access backstage pass to the Vans Warped Tour 2007. They were able to have 300 donors and save 600 lives. As a new club under SOC the group has encountered some obstacles along the way both financially and with time-management. 

"It's hard to do anything without money and all the officers are full time students. This makes it hard for all of us to be present at all times, but somehow we have managed to be there when we need to," said President of MSL Jackie Gadea.

Angel Garcia, advisor for MSL, wants to help the group grow and to establish its name on campus.

"My goal is to take all my experiences - from being involved here at FIU to being a student leader to now being a professional - giving my knowledge and as much research and guidance as I can," said Garcia. "I also want to give them everything I got as far as knowledge and motivating members and just the tools of success to lead a such a big club as [MSL]."

Some other goals the group plans on achieving this school year are establishing its name around campus and retaining membership. 

Gadea plans to accomplish this goal by building upon the relationships they already have in the music industry, tabling in the Graham Center and working with other on-campus philanthropies and organizations. 

Other officers who have taken part in organizing and bringing MSL on campus are Michael Thomas, Noor Daghistani and Lauren Agosto. 

Together, during meetings, they bring a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere and have members speak their minds and share ideas.  

To become official members students must pay a one time $10 fee used for member shirts and basic club expenses. At the end of the semester members must obtain 20 points to establish active status. Points are obtained by attending service events, blood drives and socials. 

Current sophomore and MSL member Luis Rivera was one of the first people to find out information on MSL during Club Fair Week. As a new member he's looking forward to many events and projects with the club. 

"I look forward to great times and saving lives. It doesn't matter if I get recognition as long as the patients are able to continue living and able to live a prosperous life." 

Meetings are held every other Wed. in GC 140 or GC 241. For more information on Music Saves Lives contact TeamMiami@MusicSavesLives.com.

Headline: Review: Britney Spears - Blackout (Music)
Subheadline: Mega pop album has convincing charm
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The success of Britney Spears' heavily produced single "Gimme More" has given the ubiquitous Spears a presence on the radio charts that she hasn't had in years. Arguably, not since Madonna has America had a pop star with Spears' level of notoriety, making it all too easy to focus on everything but the music. 

While Madonna took an aggressive approach to her public persona, in the age of blogging and viral networking, all Spears has to do to end up on everyone's coffee table is walk barefoot.  

This time around though, her secret weapon is not an umbrella, but producer Nate "Danja" Hills - and when he swings, it's a hit. Blackout has style, sex, sass and swagger to spare. Spears teases, giggles and pants her way through the tracks with breathy come-ons, occasionally sounding forced but mostly it's a style that's distinctly her own. 

Swedish production team Bloodshy & Avant, the masterminds behind her hit "Toxic" from In The Zone, return to her side with tracks like "Radar," a future-pop song that bounces along to an actual radar-blip sound effect that borders on gimmicky but sounds like it could be a club staple.

Spears cranks up her libido more than a dog in heat, and her producers ward off any sign of a refractory period by delivering the slickest of slick hip-hop beats and all the electronic bells, whistles and pink streamers you'd expect from a pop album of this stature. 

At times, though, like on the ode to Spears' love for pole-dancing, "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)," the production becomes so thick and overbearing that her vocal performances sound more like an afterthought, becoming twisted, chopped up and dressed up.

Blackout has a convincing charm, however: Spears sounds like she's definitely having more fun than you, and she's being more sonically adventurous than in any of her previous albums, but it's still just plastic pop. Stand-out track 

"Toy Soldier" has drums that fire off like a pink Uzi with Britney delivering the lyrics in a sexy drawl that really makes the song. Spears' playful self-awareness, like on the rumored second single "Piece of Me," gives the album its legs and personality, even if it is penned by hired hands. 

She sings "I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous/I'm Mrs. Oh-my-God that Britney's shameless/I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! This just in/I'm Mrs. She's too big, now she's too thin." 

Frequent acknowledgments of "goin' crazy," being a freak, looking insane and "falling off the edge of my mind" may make you grin, but Spears wears the labels proudly and elevates her like any pair of knee-high diamond studded boots.

Ultimately, the album works because the tracks feel like they naturally play off each other. The album's title that has everyone snickering supposedly refers to "blacking out negativity and embracing life"- okay Britney, real cute. 

It's not explicitly a concept album, and everything here is about as profound as a puddle, but Blackout plays through briskly, and is insistent on entertaining without ever succumbing to filler. 

Spears has faced the kind of scrutiny that can paralyze even the most talented stars, but fortunately for her and her listeners, what was preceded by a series of bitter events ends in this very sweet album.

Headline: Report shows students lack sexual awareness
Author: Shannon Fallon / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A wise man once said, "the right selection is to protect your erection." 

He was probably encouraging sexual active students to protect themselves. However, according to a study conducted by Trojan, FIU is not taking proper action to provide its students with the proper sexual health resources and information. 

Trojan conducts a study each year called the Sexual Report Card. The study analyuzes sexual health programs offered throughout American colleges and universities.

This year, 139 schools participated in the study and were graded on a number of topics such as sexual health awareness programs, contraceptive availability, HIV testing and lecture outreach programs; FIU ranked 88 out of 139 schools.

Casandra Roache, senior health educator at the University Park Wellness Center does not agree with the study, however. 

"We do not have a lack of sexual health awareness, not on the Wellness Center's part," Roache said. "What we have is a walking problem. Everyone at FIU is too lazy to walk over to the center to utilize all the programs we offer. I don't know what to do anymore. Trojan also never contacted the Wellness Center about conducting the study."

The Wellness Center offers a number of tests to students via appointments; free contraceptions are also available. 

"FIU currently has a grant for free chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and we also do free HIV testing," she said. "I don't know what else to do. I practically throw condoms in students' faces in order to get them involved in all the resources and outreach programs that we offer."  

Trojan conducts these studies throughout colleges in response to teenage pregnancy statistics, which show that there are 750,000 unintended teenage pregnancies each year with 19 million sexually transmitted infections and more then one billion acts of unprotected sex among single adults.  

Despite such statistics, student Johan Morales is not too interested in venturing over to the Wellness Center or in hearing statistics.

"I don't need to go and walk over to hear what I could get or what girls could get and all the other things they try and tell you to not have sex. All I know is if I wrap it up then I know I'm good to go. 

Other students, though, such as sophomore John Gibbson do take the time to use the services offered by the Wellness Center. 

"I go there weekly and pick up condoms," he said. Why would I go across the street and buy them when I have them here on campus for free?"

According to Trojan's study, lack of information and resources is partially to blame for FIU's poor score, but Roache is puzzled as to where Trojan obtained its information - she was never contacted. 

Regardless of the implications of the study, student Jenna Stone likes to stay aware on sexual health issues.

"I keep myself informed on sexual health issues and even use the Wellness Center from time to time," Stone said. "I don't need to be catching anything that makes me itch, blister or [that is] life-threatening."

Headline: Students make use of condoms, birth control
Author: Olivia sarracino / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With a 90 and a 53 percent increase in 2002, the condom and the birth control pill, are both commonly known as a method of contraception, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Both contraceptives prevent pregnancies, but the condom is the only one that can protect partners from HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. 

Donna Weidema, an advanced registered nurse practitioner at FIU's University Health Services, said that the most important thing for someone to consider before choosing the right contraceptive is knowing their own body aside from their partner's.

"Few women know their own self, they never put their fingers inside to feel their cervix," she said. "They don't know their own anatomy that is the number one mistake of young people."

The second step is to learn about the advantages and disadvantages of each method of contraception.

"Personally, when I was choosing my contraceptive, after my doctor had already given me what he thought was best for me, I went online and I looked up things I hadn't heard off, and I tiered researching it myself," said Alexis Sanchez, program assistant of the immunizations department. "When I was done I went back to my doctor and told him what I had found, we came to a mutual decision."

The American College Health Association has a list of more than 15 contraceptives, including the condom and the pill.

The list includes: the shot, Depo-Provera; contraceptive patch, Evra; intravaginal ring, Nuva; and Intrauterine devices, among others.

Depo-Provera contains progesterone, a hormone that prepares a woman's uterus for the fertilized ovum and maintains pregnancy, but this contraceptive actually inhibits sperm penetration by changes cervical mucus. Meant to be taken every three months, not only is this form of contraception effective and women don't menstruate for three months while using it, Weidema said.

"Women love it or they hate it. Because it's a no thinker, people like it," Weidema said. "I have some students that don't want to get pregnant; they've had it for two to three years." 

On the other hand, Depo-Provera, like other contraceptives, can have its disadvantages. It doesn't protect against HIV or STD's, and it can cause irregular bleeding and weight gain.

"My friend had the shot, she gained 50 pounds in a year, and it was hard to put off," said Wilma Torrero, a public relations major. "It's the hardest weight to put off." 

Evra, the contraceptive patch, is worn on the skin and contains both progesterone and estrogen, the female sex hormone. Like with Depo-Provera, the American College Health Association said that the patch, "also creates a thick mucus in the cervix and thin endometrium (lining tissue of the uterus) which interfere with sperm motility and implantation." 

This contraceptive does not intervene with sexual intercourse, decreases menstrual cramps and may improve acne. But, Evra can also have its negative side: headaches, nausea, depression, decreases in sex drive, no HIV or STD protection and weight gain. 

Weidema says that the Nuva ring is better than the birth control pill because a lot of women forget to take their pills. 

The Nuva may protect women from ectopic pregnancy, or the development of a fertilized ovum outside of the uterus, and reduces menstruation, among other benefits, Weidema said.

"The Nuva ring as far as I understand, doesn't have any cons, the only con is the possibility of slipping out," Sanchez said. "I was on it [and] there are no moody side effects, my periods remained regular."

However, like Evra, the ring also includes the same risks, including skin irritation and difficulty trying to get pregnant after being used. 

IUD copper is a small device in the shape of a "T" that damages the function of sperm. Weidema said this device is implanted in a woman in a gynecologist's office, it is not a procedure done at FIU.

The "copper-T" needs no special preparation before intercourse, no daily attention, can last up to 10 years and is reversible. 

However, it may cause cramping, more bleeding, bleeding in between periods and no HIV or STD protection. 

Other methods of contraceptives include: spermicides, the diaphragm and cervical cap, withdrawal, periodic abstinence, abstinence and sterilization. 

At times, students believe that the only solution is the condom or "the pill."

 "I think those are the only two methods they would use, any other alternative they don't have access to," said Sidney Emmanuel, a computer engineering major. "They don't know or don't have access to it." 

Students can find more information about contraceptives in the Wellness Center or at the Student Health Clinic, and they can have a Pap smear check-up for $25 and be tested for HIV for no charge. 

"We do HIV testing at the Wellness Center; they are available to anybody, even if you are not a student, staff or faculty member, just anybody within the community," Sanchez said. "It's completely free and it's completely anonymous."

Headline: Costume Construction: Quick, clever costume ideas with originality in mind
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
The best Halloween costumes are those that come with thought and creativity. This year stay away from the overly-priced, overly-worn costumes - doctors, belly dancers and ex presidents - and create your own. 

This decision will not only bring light to your outfit, but your pockets will not suffer as much as they would if you bought a pre-made one.

According to the National Retail Federation, consumers spent an estimated $5 billion on Halloween last year. About $1.8 billion of that went toward costumes. 

"It's usually the best thing you can put your personality into it," said senior Priscilla Vega. 

Why pay $40 for a costume a hundred other people are going to have when you just put your own twist to it?"

In high school, Vega said she dressed up as cute baby for Halloween. She purchased some diapers, used one of  her old baby bibs, borrowed an old diaper bag and a couple of other baby accessories to put the outfit over the top.

With originality being the aim for costumes, it should be noted that Paris Hilton in a jail outfit is going to be this year's most popular pop culture costume according to survey conducted by shopping.com. 

Most of these costumes can be made with homemade products and clothing in your closet already and purchasing an item or two from a dollar store. 

This Halloween, don't even think about setting foot into your local Party City or Halloween costume shop.

Sometimes when creating a last minute costume, having a lot friends can come in handy. 

FIU alumna Heather McCalla said that a lot of her costumes that she has made for Halloween couldn't have been done with out the help of her friends.

McCalla said that she dressed up as nurse one Halloween and was only able to get away with the outfit by borrowing a stethoscope and several other medical tools from a friend who worked in the medical field. 

"I try to borrow as much stuff from friends as possible," McCalla said. "Sometimes you'll be amazed at what you friends have so you don't have to purchase materials or accessories for a costume."

Another time, she dressed up as Madonna from her "Like a Virgin" music video. Since she couldn't find a wedding dress and didn't want to spend a fortune purchasing a wedding gown, she simply wore a white mini-skirt and finger-less gloves, with a lacy top and bra underneath. 

The only part of the costume that didn't come from her closet was pair of pearls she borrowed from a friend which completed the costume. 

"People loved it. They said I was the best Madonna look alike ever," she said.

The idea behind creating your own Halloween costume is originality, wit and saving money. Here are a couple of costume ideas that should only cost between $5-$10.



COSTUMES WITH WIT 

OR ATTEMPTED WIT



Leaf Blower: Wear a baseball cap with a leaf dangling in front of your face. When someone asks what you are, blow on the leaf.

Baby-sitter: Strap a baby doll to your behind and sit on it.

Fashion Police: Dress up as a police officer and then throw on a few trendy bits: platform shoes and a boa. Blow a whistle at people walking by and say things like, 'Carpenter pants, that's so 80's? That's a no-no. I'm going to have to take you in for that one.'

Dirty Laundry: Get an old plastic laundry basket and cut a hole through the middle, big enough to fit around your middle. Attach the basket to your body using suspenders and throw some clothes in. To make it more realistic, throw some of your actual dirty laundry in there. 

Tourist: Wear khakis, a Hawaiian shirt, sunglasses, a straw hat and sandals with socks. Randomly take pictures of people (with or without film in your camera) and ask where the bus stops.

White Trash: Wear all white and attach trash (i.e., milk cartons, paper, candy wrappers) all over yourself or step into a white trash bag overflowing with trash. You can use glue or pins to attached the trash to the clothes.

God's Gift to Women: Find a box large enough to fit around your body. Cut some holes for your arms and head and cover the box with wrapping paper. Add a large bow. Attach a tag that says "TO: Women, FROM: God."  



COUPLES' COSTUMES



For the following couples' costumes, the roles can always be reversed. 

Butterfly and Butterfly Catcher: She dresses as a butterfly and he dresses as a butterfly catcher (khaki shirt and shorts, safari hat, boots and a butterfly net).

Cardiac Arrest:  She dresses up as a big red heart (cut out of cardboard or cloth) and wears handcuffs. He dresses like a cop.

UPS Driver and his or her package: He dresses up in a dark brown button-down short-sleeved shirt, and brown shorts, with a UPS logo on the pocket. She wears a large box, wrapped in brown paper, with holes cut for head and arms.

Headline: Family firsts speak about college life
Author: Elvis Ramirez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
First generation students often do not know what to expect during their first year of university life.

Jonathan Klopp, the first member of his family to attend college, had no doubt he'd continue his education. With his mother wanting him to become a doctor he decided that majoring in biology would be his first step in his college career, although he wasn't sure that's what he wanted.

After realizing that his interests did not lie in biology, Klopp changed majors. According to Klopp, his impression of college life was very different than what it actually is.

"Things came at me that no one told me about," said Klopp, now a sophomore majoring in international business and minoring in linguistics. "I didn't know I had to hop into something right away."

Guy Cayo, a senior studying business management who is also a first generation student, found that the social aspect of college life was just as difficult as selecting the right major.

It seems that first generation students find it harder to connect with their classmates, even other first generation students.

"I think the difference between [students whose parents have gone to a university] is that getting to know people and things like that took longer for me," Cayo said.

Cayo admitted that he rarely spoke to other people his first semester, both in an out of class. His life consisted of going to school and going home, Cayo said. Gruesome is the word he uses to describe his first days of his college career.

Despite being stunned by the initial change between high school and university life, most of these students believe that they have done well for themselves.

"I think I did fantastic, even if my parents didn't have the experience," said Patricia Sando, a senior studying in FIU's Honor's College, majoring in psychology. "I didn't have anyone to give me a heads-up on what to expect and how to expect it."

Contrary to the conclusions from a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, which states that first generation students are at a disadvantage and often perform poorly at the university level, these students feel that they are not disadvantaged at all. 



Cayo even said that he got more out of college because the experience was all new.

"I feel more independent because I did things on my own," said Celinda Miranda, a senior studying public relations.

Miranda moved into Panther Hall during her first semester. Big things like selecting classes were not the problem, small things like studying were, Miranda said.

Had she had someone to guide her, she would have taken classes more seriously, Miranda said. Like many other first generation students, Miranda found it hard to explain university life to her parents.

Another similarity between first generation students seems to be that their families do not pressure them as harshly as it would be expected. There is a certain amount of pressure but it is more focused on actually finishing college rather than how the students finish college.However, the parent's lack of understanding leads to high expectations. 

"My family expected me to be done in four years," said Miranda. "They didn't understand that this college isn't like high school." 

Despite the difficulties, first generation students share the pride of being the first in their family to go to a college or a university. There is also a common feeling of serving as inspiration for younger members of their family.

"I wouldn't change the experience [as a first generation student] for anything. Although there are some weekends I'd like to forget," Klopp said chuckling.

Headline: Adjunct's infection not MRSA
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Two classrooms were closed and disinfected on Oct. 25 and 26 after an adjunct theater professor notified the department that she may have a staph infection.

The adjunct went to the hospital after noticing a boil in her skin on the evening of Oct. 25. After undergoing testing at a hospital, the results showed that she didn't have the bacteria called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

"A faculty member expressed concern that she may have contracted a mild case of staph infection, but then discovered that she didn't have the [MRSA)]," said David Bergwall, associate dean of the College of Architecture and The Arts.

Dr. Robert Dollinger, executive director University Health Services, spoke to the adjunct and said that she is in "good shape," and will be back to teach Monday.

"She had a very minor boil. It's not a serious infection from a public health point of view," Dollinger said. "It's not even MRSA."

Upon hearing about the infection, the facilities management department disinfected classrooms in room 120 of the Wertheim Performing Arts Center and room 150 of Deuxieme Maison. A note was left in each of the rooms notifying students that classes had been cancelled and would resume Monday. Charles Cyrille, Emergency Management Coordinator, said that the classes were disinfected as a precautionary measure.

Dollinger said that the most common way people get infected is by physical contact.

"There wasn't even a need to disinfect the class. This is not an emergency and never should have been treated as a emergency," Dollinger said. "The only time there should be an emergency like this is when there's a bomb."

According to WebMd.com, MRSA is a staph infection that is resistant to methicilllin and other commonly used antibiotics like penicillin, amoxicillin and oxacillin. This month, the Center for Disease Control reported that there were more deaths from MRSA in 2005 than from AIDS.

The report said that nearly 19,000 people died from MRSA in 2005. MRSA has usually been spread through healthcare facilities but are becoming increasingly common in student athletes participating in close-contact sports.

MRSA can begin as a reddened area on the skin, or resemble a pimple that can develop into a skin abscess or boil causing fever, pus, drainage, swelling, or pain.  If you see a reddened area of your skin, a boil or abscess that is causing fever, local swelling and/or pain, you should see your physician urgently.

Students who feel they may have a serious staph infection should call the Student Health Clinic at University Park, 305-348-2401 or at the Biscayne Bay Campus, 305-919-5620.

Headline: FIU loses bid to host presidential debate
Author: Daniella Bacigalupo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After NBC and Leadership Florida representatives explored FIU and other Florida universities last August to judge which campus was worthy of hosting the Democratic and Republican presidential debates Jan 23 and 25, Florida Atlantic University was announced the chosen location.

Despite losing the bid, FIU had the credentials and experience needed to host the live presidential debates, which will be broadcasted nationally by NBC.

Wendy Abberger, the executive director of Leadership Florida, a nonprofit group organizing the event, said she was "so impressed by the [FIU] staff, their enthusiasm and willingness to do whatever was necessary," to make the event possible. 

However, Leadership Florida's press release Sept. 27 named FAU, in Boca Raton, as the hosting site for the debates. 

Other universities evaluated included the University of Miami, University of Florida, University of South Florida and Florida State University.

"Final differences with the top candidates came down to structural nuances," Abberger said.

The deciding factor was FAU's Carole and Barry Kaye Performing Arts Auditorium for its 2,400 person capacity. 

Anthony Rionda, the lecture coordinator of the Student Government Association who was part of the tour group last August, said the representatives were shown the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, the Graham Center Ballrooms and the new Frost Art Museum.

FIU plans consisted of staging the debates at PAC, converting the GC Ballrooms into a news spin room and spreading students throughout campus where the debates would be streamed live. 

The PAC stage's conciseness rose reservations.

"They had very specific criteria … It was all a very complicated process," said Stephen Sauls, the vice president of government relations, and added that accommodations to enlarge the stage would have been carried out. 

Both NBC and the Republican National Committee had doubts on whether Boca Raton was the right place to hold the debates because the city "sounded snooty," said Robert Watson, professor at Lynn University and former political scientist at FAU, in an interview with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.  

FAU's President Frank Brogan used his contacts with the RNC and former Governor Jeb Bush to sway the decision to host the presidential debates at FAU, Watson told the Sun-Sentinel. 

Bush and Brogan were elected Florida's Governor and Lieutenant Governor in 1998. 

Abberger said decisions came down to physical layout and "we just peeled away the best of the best."  

Fairness, not political weight, influenced the FAU site decision, Rionda said. 

"Miami gets all of the debates. I guess they were trying to spread out the wealth," Rionda said. 

The FAU site announcement comes after Florida's controversial decision to hold presidential primaries early on Jan. 29, ahead of the nationally scheduled Feb. 5 date.  

The debates will be the last time presidential candidates can influence swing voters. 

FIU's denial is a missed opportunity to tap into the University's high rate of the recently registered voters, Rionda said. 

"The main goal should be to bring candidates to campus, so that [recently registered voters] can make an informed choice and hear both sides of the story," he said.

The Student Government Association is sending proposals to each candidate, inviting them to give speeches on campus. 

Rionda said SGA received positive feedback from the Rudolph Giuliani campaign camp but democratic candidates seemed to be in a tough spot.

He blamed the National Democratic Party's discouragement of candidate campaigning in Florida to the State's decisions to hold primaries early against party rules.

Headline: Opposing parties debate on education
Author: Lauren Agosto / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The College Democrats and College Republicans, two political organizations at FIU with opposing views on various issues, usually schedule debates on campus to express their party's ideals to the rest of the student body. 

Their next debate, which will focus on education, will take place Nov. 6 at 10 a.m. in the Graham Center Pit. 

Chris Cabral, president of the College Democrats, will be part of the debate. He said that the issues to be discussed most likely will focus on higher education.

"Aside from the fact that we are all college students, in this economy and society, education has never been more important," Cabral said. "When the government cuts grants by millions of dollars, we need to make students aware."

The Republican Party believes that the government should have a limited role in education, which is something they will focus on during the debate. 

"I don't think someone in Washington should be making decisions about someone in Tulsa," said Juanky Robaina, president of the College Republicans, who will also be part of the debate. "I think those decisions can be more adequately made by someone local."

The Republican Party is also in favor of vouchers that use government funds to pay for students to attend private schools, giving parents the opportunity to send their children to the schools of their choice.

 While Cabral said the vouchers take much needed funds away from the public school system, the Republicans disagree.

"In the limited amount of time that [the vouchers] have been in use, I think they have been pretty successful," Robaina said. "We should encourage programs that enhance education rather than stick to what we have. Personally, I'm not a big fan of mediocrity."

Rather than taking students out of the public school system as a result of poor education, the Democratic Party believes that accountability is the key to the success. They feel the states, districts, schools, teachers, students and parents need to be held accountable and shut down the poorly performing schools. They also believe that there is a dire need to reduce class size, to modernize facilities and hire new teachers. All of these ideas will be brought up during the debate as well.

"We need to hold the government accountable for the way things are. Republican education in this country has obviously been a failure," Cabral said.

Chris Khawad, president of Democracy for America, will also take part in the debate and will take the stance of the idea of in total privatization. 

"Public schools are uncompetitive. If they're bad schools, they will go out of business," Kahawad said. "Only the best schools will survive."  

On Jan. 8, 2002, President George W. Bush signed the "No Child Left Behind Act" which reauthorized a number of federal programs aiming to improve the performance of schools by increasing the standards of accountability and providing parents more freedom in choosing which schools their children will attend. 

However, President Bush provided schools $27 billion less than he had promised.

Over the past three years, college tuitions have risen by 35 percent nationwide, pricing 220,000 students out of college. While then Florida Governor Jeb Bush promised to increase college aid, President Bush tried to charge more for student loans and eliminate Pell Grants for 84,000 students.

On Oct. 12, Legislature approved cuts to financial aid available for college students, a topic that Cabral feels is essential to the debate. 

Al Gore, potential Democratic candidate, has proposed a National Tuition Savings program to tie together state savings programs in more than 30 states so that parents can save for college tax-free. They are proposing a tax cut that allows families to choose either a $10,000 a year tax deduction or a $2,800 tax credit.

Rather than base aid on those who exhibit financial need, the Republican Party votes to give financial aid to students who take more challenging courses in order to help colleges and universities improve their math and science departments. "The cuts are a mistake. FIU will be hit the hardest because half of our students receive financial aid," Cabral said.

The debate will be moderated by Jose Maya, assistant news director for student media and will be aired live on WRGP 88.1 FM and 95.3 FM.





~ Correction ~
In the Oct. 29, 2007 issue, in the article titled "Opposing Parties debate on Education," Chris Cabral was misquoted and Chris Khawand's name was spelled
incorrectly.

In the same article the Democratic Party was incorrectly attributed with the belief that all poorly performing public schools should be "shut down."

Also in that article, "Chris Khawand" was incorrectly identified as the President of Democracy For America. He is not associated with them at all.

The president of the Democracy For America Campus Corp chapter at FIU is Franco Caliz.

To clarify, Khawand's views in the article do not reflect those of the Democracy For America Organization or those affiliated.

Headline: GROWING DISCORD: Racial hostility affecting schools
Author: Joseph Marhee / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In the past year, there has been a rise in hate crimes and documented racism in schools, the likes of which has not been seen since the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and '60s. And even more, many of these acts have involved students. Among them, a racially-motivated attack on three FIU students in September.

Lately the news has been showering the public with reports regarding racism and one case with such thinly veiled racism, epitomizing the recent surge in hate crimes: the Jena 6.

While the allegations against these six black students isn't alarmingly new, the fact that this is happening in America's schools is just one piece of evidence that we, as a nation, are not as tolerant as we would like to believe.

The attack on the Jena 6 is not an isolated event and the alleged hate crime right across from Cooper City High School is just one example of many attacks in the Tri-County area alone.

The number of hate crimes in schools is on a seemingly astronomical rise: 13.5 percent of all reported hate crimes occurred in schools in 2005 according to the U.S. Department of Justice, and have since almost tripled as of August 2007. Also 54.7 percent of these attacks are racially motivated.

Hate crimes are not only classified by race-related events: hate crimes can also be classified by attacks against the disabled, homosexuals, people of varying religious beliefs, and just about any 'difference' a person could have.

In Washington, D.C., in early October, a black student was attacked at the Model Secondary School for the Deaf. The students were beaten and then with a marker were covered with racial-slurs and writings of 'KKK' and variations of a swastika. This incident was not only racially motivated, but also aimed at the handicapped students of this school, according to the Metro Police. 

No suspects have been identified but this is just one of many very brutal, unsolved attacks in the D.C. area.

Florida had the sixth highest number of reported incidents in 2005, with 231 reported incidents, and, as speculated, has since reached a higher standing on this list as of early 2007, occurring mostly in the Miami-Dade and Broward counties area, arguably the most economically and racially diverse areas in the state.

Upon reading these reports and living in these areas, one might assume it's not as rampant as all the news reports entail it to be but does that mean it's nonexistent? Is it possible that Miami is living proof that ignorance is bliss?

Unfortunately, it seems as such. It's more than plausible that South Florida's residents are more than accustomed to living in such a racially or economically divided area that we don't realize this is not how things are everywhere else. 

How many times have you or your friends driven though Opa Locka or Liberty City and been afraid to step foot out of the car because you're not of the 'proper race' to be seen in public? 

Is it because you think you'll be robbed because you're white or Hispanic in a black neighborhood? 

Conversely, would a black resident feel the same way driving into a city like Davie or Plantation because of Broward towns' reputations of being filled with 'rednecks' and 'southerners'? But that is the case.

This isn't happening only here, but South Florida is a prime example of how 'harmless' stereotypes are truly less-than-subtle forms of racism and a modern form of segregation, with citizens willingly moving into predominantly black, white, or hispanic neighborhoods. 

We are furthering ourselves from being one community rather than hundreds of socio-economically divided communities and, consequently, it's this practice of sticking together and fear-mongering via increasingly hostile stereotypes that allow hate crimes to happen. 

Extinguishing racism and other forms of discrimination is not plausible and very unlikely to improve any time soon, it should be realized that we, as a society, are doing this to ourselves, and that maybe being 'color-blind' isn't the answer either, that we need to embrace our differences and accept other peoples' as well. 

Only then can we truly call ourselves a community.

Headline: Editorial: Take caution, no one is immune to rape
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Earlier this week, an FIU student woke up naked and bloodied next to a man she went home with the night before.  The alleged rapist, Gary Zerola, a former Boston, Mass., defense attorney, was charged with sexual battery.  

He evidently forced her to take unknown pills and raped her while she lay unconscious, completely vulnerable. 

Although taking the proper precautions to reduce the chance of rape, the student never imagined she would be a victim-no one does. No one ever expects to be raped.  

But maybe that's the problem-we don't accept that we are potential victims of rape, therefore we don't take precautions to avoid it. We need to, because no one-men, children, or women-is free from the horrific prospect.

The occurrence of sexual assault and rape is still high, indicating that many people do not safeguard themselves properly. In 2004-2005 alone, "there was an average annual 200,780 victims of rape, attempted rape or sexual assault," according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN).

It is not possible to identify a rapist-but it is very possible to weaken the chances of being a victim. To begin with, don't have the mind-set that rape is not a possibility, especially when "every two and a half minutes, somewhere in America, someone is sexually assaulted," according to RAINN.

 Next, do not allow yourself to be vulnerable among acquaintances without a family member or close friend nearby. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape (PCAR) confirms "7 in 10 rape and sexual assault victims know their attacker prior to the assault. If the FIU student had a friend with her to contact, she could have avoided the assault.

And contrary to the belief that only women can be raped, a study by PCAR shows how one study estimated that, 92,748 adult American men experience a completed or attempted rape.

The consequences from this ordeal are endless; she may never be able to trust another man or might require weekly therapy sessions. The FIU student may be traumatized for the rest of her life, and "chances that a woman will develop post-traumatic stress disorder after being raped are between 50 percent and 95 percent. 

Rape can affect anyone, regardless of race or sex.  It's consequences are irreversible and lifelong. By simply following a few precautionary steps, one can lessen their chances of becoming another statistic, another victim.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: The Stealth Campus
Author: Christopher M. Rego / Senior / Civil Engineering Student 
&nbsp;
Down the street from University Park you will find a three story building standing out from the rest. This building is the Engineering Campus. Yes, there's another campus. We're not on the maps in your student handbook, but we exist.  

You could say we're flying under the radar. In fact that's how many of us feel over here. Everyday we go to a building that's cold, stark, in serious need of repair, and resembles more an institution than a university. Portions of the building have not been repaired or replaced since Hurricane Katrina! 

We lack the basic amenities which those on UP take for granted and see absolutely none of the improvements UP provides. Students at UP have the bookstore, a new gym, beautiful landscaping, new places to eat, and comfortable areas for students to hang out and study. 

Here we get none of that. 

All we have is the Panther Pit with rundown furniture and a poor excuse for a pool table. We are in serious need of attention. Do we not go to the same school or pay the same tuition? Why can't we receive the same benefits that everyone else gets? 

The school can spend $35 million on a stadium for a team that hasn't had a winning season, yet they can't spend a small portion of that money on students who will advance our modern technical society one day? 

Things need to change and people need to start paying attention to us. We feel like we are the runts of the litter. So if you have never been to the "Stealth" campus I invite you to come visit us and help us feel like we are part of the family that is FIU.

Headline: Commentary: Follow the Leader...Golden Panthers' football needs to follow precedent set by USF, other Florida schools
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Look around the state of Florida. You see programs with proud traditions as well as their fledgling counterparts, striving to make a name for themselves amongst the big boys.

Each of these programs has its own individual history and traditions, but there is one thing that is unifying most of them this season.

All over the state, college football teams and their fans are having a good time this season. 

The University of South Florida is ranked for the first time and was flirting with national title hopes before a loss to Rutgers. 

The University of Florida, despite two losses, is still ranked near the Top 10 and will challenge for a South Eastern Conference title at the end of the year if nothing else. 

Even Florida Atlantic and the University of Central Florida are looking at possible conference titles and even bids to a bowl game.

Florida State University  and the University of Miami, once proud programs who are in the midst of mediocre seasons to their standards, are above .500. 

FSU was even receiving votes in the Top-25 polls up until last week.

Then you have FIU. You see  the skeleton of a stadium that is being planned to hold what is, at this point, a skeleton of a good football program. 

You walk around campus and see a sea of blue, orange, green, and burgundy, representing the colors of everyone's favorite non-FIU schools, and you hope that one day, these students will don the gold and blue and watch their school in that new stadium. 

Despite the lack of support from the student population, you go down to a football practice and you don't see players dogging it in practice and you don't see the coaching staff taking it easy in the middle of the team's second straight lost season. 

The players and the coaches understand that getting to the next level with the rest of the state isn't an easy task, but it is possible if they try and follow the path laid out by the rest of the other schools.

It's probably not easy to see similarities between USF and FIU. On the one hand, you have a current, Top-15 ranked team with a nationally ranked defense and on the other you have, well, FIU. 

However, many people forget that just thee seasons ago, USF was coming off consecutive seasons where it compiled a 10-13 record. 

Not exactly the sign of a powerhouse. 

So how did they manage to go from that to a force to be reckoned with in such a short time?

Well, an obvious answer is head coach Jim Leavitt, who has been with the program since it's inception and is given as a main reason why the team has been so successful. 

His greatest traits are his tireless recruiting work, finding the players who have slipped under the big universities' radars and promising them playing time right away. 

His enthusiasm for the game is also something that is evident every time he is on the sidelines.

Leavitt has been mentioned as a possible candidate for coaching anywhere from Alabama to Miami to Kansas State, and yet he has stuck with his program that he has built from the ground up, an admirable quality in this day and age of Nick Sabans and Steve Spurriers, following the money where ever it leads them.

Anyone who has spent anytime at FIU practices can see some of the Leavitt's same traits from FIU head coach Mario Cristobal.

Both returned to their hometowns to coach at schools with fledgeling football programs. 

And while Cristobal doesn't wear his emotions on his sleeve as much as Leavitt, he is out there barking at the refs any time they make a bad call during games and he seems to take losses as hard as anyone on the team. 

Cristobal has made an effort to pick up the best talent he can through recruiting, a tall order when FIU might be the seventh school on most players' radars in the state. 

This isn't the worst thing in the world, however. 

Florida has more talent than any state in the country, with 300 players from the state making their way to Division I-A in the last year alone. 

While this hasn't exactly shown thus far, it is only his first year, after all. 

You can already see some of his guys making an impact on the field, with the team fielding more freshman than most others  teams in Division I-A, with more than 20 seeing playin time this year.

Unfortunately, it even took Leavitt 10 years to build his program to where it is now, so FIU fans are going to have to be patient. 

But don't be surprised if in a few years, FIU and Cristobal become a media sensation like USF and Leavitt. It's just going to take some time.

Headline: Baseball: Team downs Canadian amateurs in exhibition game
Author: Luca Messina / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The baseball team dominated in it rain-soaked exhibition game against Team British Columbia 11-2 Oct. 25 at University Park Stadium. The game was marked by timely hits and an abundance of errors by the opposition. 

British Columbia's squad consisted of mainly 17- and 18-year-old high school seniors looking to get exposure at the college level. FIU's first year coach Turtle Thomas organized the early exhibition as he has a mutual relationship with British Columbia's coach Doug Matheson. 

"I met him last year when I was at Arizona State as I recruited a lot his players," Thomas said. "He's a great guy and has a players-first mentality, which is great." 

FIU would get a lead it wouldn't relinquish early on after scoring four first-inning runs. 

Three of those runs came on costly BC errors, while one came on an RBI double by freshman designated hitter Javier Sujo. Sujo would finish the game 4-for-5 with two RBI. 

In the third inning, the Golden Panthers would add three more runs, making it 7-0, after an error and three hits. The lead was all FIU would need as Corey Polizzano dominated on the mound. 

The sophomore finished with four innings pitched, seven strikeouts, three walks and one hit allowed. 

The rest of the game was marked by a run in every inning except the eighth as FIU clearly overpowered a young team with 13 hits. 

"What I liked was the number of at-bats we got and the two-out hits," Thomas said. "A lot of leadoff guys got on and we used the field good. 

This was the first game-like situation the team has participated in under its new coach. 

"It was good to finally play someone with a different colored jersey; it's like a break in the action for us," Thomas said.

Despite the promising score, Thomas mentioned a couple of negatives that are certainly understandable at this very young point in the preseason. 

"I thought we were sloppy at the end," Thomas said. "[Our team] pitched well, but we kind of lost focus. I told the guys in the fifth inning, this game is nine innings, not five."  

FIU held British Columbia scoreless until the ninth inning when two runs scored. 

Thomas also noted the exceptional play of both shortstop Junior Arrojo (2-for-5) and first baseman Enrique Cepero (2-for-5, one RBI). 

Junior Jorge Ramos pitched the last three innings as Team British Columbia could only muster six total hits off the Golden Panthers' pitching staff. 

With so much more time until the start of the regular season, FIU will continue to train in different ways. 

Thomas mentioned how the players will right now focus on strength and conditioning before they polish their skills for the season. 

"Guys will lift weights three days a week and take a part in our conditioning program," he said. "We are not just preparing for the opening game, but the grind of the whole season." 

For now, the Golden Panthers will enjoy both the victory and the different competition. 

The Turtle Thomas era for the FIU baseball team will officially begin in only four months against the University of Southern California on Feb. 22.

Headline: Co-ed exhibition game gives players chance to show off skills
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panther Arena hosted the Tip-Off Classic on Oct. 24, a co-ed basketball game between the men's and women's basketball teams. 

In the end the white-clad team coached by women's head coach Cindy Russo won 62-52 over men's head coach Sergio Rouco's blue team.

The game was played with two 15-minute halves and a women's basketball was used. 

Most of the women's team competed in the game, however, only Alex Galindo, Chris Fuller, Russell Hicks, Badara N'diaye and Erick Nsangou played from the men's side. 

The other members of the team were in late classes and unable to suit up. 

The game started out with the white team taking an early lead they would never lose. They were led by Galindo, who put up the most points on the night with 21. 

Some of the players had some fun with the game, including Chris Fuller of the blue team attempting to block a free throw by the white team. 

The men and women seemed to play pretty well together despite seldom running full court games with each other. 

"I think this event is great," Galindo said. "It gives fans a chance to see both teams at the same time. Hopefully next year and in the future we can do the same thing."

Before the game, FIU students were offered some free food in front of the arena while members of the FIU athletic department, basketball coaches and most of the basketball players attended a dinner and silent auction inside the arena.

Headline: New commercial shows Dwyane Wade before pro success
Author: Tim Reynolds / Ap Wire
&nbsp;
Dwyane Wade never intended for these words to become public.

They were the innermost thoughts of the Miami Heat's star guard, quickly typed into his e-mail device during a private moment in a New York hotel room this summer, all off the top of his head.

No editing, no revising, no concerns about spelling or punctuation or grammar.

"You said I needed to become a man and that I counted on you way too much ... so you left me _ feeling unsure, unloved and confused," Wade wrote, expressing sentiments that he'd carried around for years. "How could you not love me anymore?"

Some of his relatives and closest confidants soon read what he had typed. And almost everyone had absolutely no idea what he was talking about. A woman? A parent? A friend?

"I wanted people not to know until the end, "Wade said. "And then I hit them with it."

It was his ode to basketball, specifically about the year that helped turn him into a superstar.

And those private words are out in the open now, serving as the inspiration for his latest Converse commercial, which will be released nationwide Oct. 28 during the broadcast of the Dolphins-Giants game being played in London.

"People are going to think I didn't write it at first," Wade said. "But they'll eventually understand that it's all me.''

Wade has dabbled in writing for about as long as he can remember.

He's penned the occasional poem and kept a journal in his college days at Marquette. He even was a sports writer for his high school newspaper, reporting on his own basketball team a few times.

"I spelled my name right,'' he said, "and I was about the only one who did.''

He always understood the importance of school, but didn't qualify academically to play his freshman season at Marquette. So he played no games in the 2000-01 campaign there, only being allowed to practice.

"There's no doubt that he got inspired and fired up and worked,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. "There's no doubt that year helped him get to where he is today."

That year, Wade said, was pure agony.

"It shaped him," said Tom Crean, his coach at Marquette. "It made him appreciate everything so much more as time went on and made him focus so much better, because now, he had to deal with the fact that there was nothing compared to basketball when it came to having glory and having so much success."

Crean has nothing but the highest praise for Wade, and cringes when recalling what happened when he saw stories suggesting that the guard from Robbins, Ill., couldn't handle college academically.

"One of the top anger moments in my life is when an article came out that questioned him academically and how much he struggled," Crean said. "I'll never forget that because it was so wrong. He did so well here. He never struggled here. He was always flourishing here."

And that was the case for one simple reason: Basketball depended on it.

The commercial doesn't have much dialogue, and doesn't need it.

It begins with the arena dark and Wade walking through a hallway. He darts through the tunnel the Heat use to take the floor at home games, tapping his hand twice against a photo that's part of a collage of championship moments from those 2006 finals against Dallas, the series he dominated to win MVP honors.

He's in workout gear, trots onto the hardwood and begins to skip around. There is no ball and no one else in the building. He heads to the top of the key and pantomimes the act of taking one jump shot, then another before hopping around in a tight circle and looking toward the empty seats.

The message is simple: He's simply overjoyed to be on the floor.

"You were the one that understood me _ but I knew deep down inside you were gonna come back to me," Wade wrote. "So I practiced on ways that I could love you more, and for you to never leave me again. And then 2001-2002 came ... you said the words that I've always dreamed of hearing..."

He now heads up the steps of the arena, takes his seat in a press box high above the court and flips on a microphone, intense look on his face, and delivers the only words in the spot.

"From Robbins, Illinois, 6-foot-4 guard Dwyane Wade."

That's how he was introduced at Marquette in the 2001-02 season, his first one back in the game.

Wade is sitting on a couch in a dressing room at the arena now, taking a break from filming the commercial. Someone has brought in Chinese food for lunch. A trainer is massaging his calf, and Wade decides the time is right to talk about how the ode went from thoughts to text.

"My brother wrote something about basketball and I liked it. It was nice," Wade said. "So I said, 'I'm going to go in my room and write something.' And I wound up writing about my year without basketball, one of the biggest years in my life."

Some people suspected the letter was about last season, when he missed much of latter portions with a dislocated shoulder and wasn't healthy enough to be a major factor in the postseason that saw Miami swept out of the first round by the Chicago Bulls.

It had nothing to do with that.

Sure, losing the NBA title hurt, but nothing like that year away from the game. And now, seven years later, Wade is no longer shy about holding his feelings back about that point in his life.

"The year I couldn't play, it hurt my pride, "Wade said. "It hurt me to watch my team go through a 15-14 season without me. I wanted to prove myself and why I went to Marquette, when a lot of people didn't know where it even was. For a year, I was forgotten. And I don't ever want to be forgotten again."
