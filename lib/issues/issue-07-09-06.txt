Headline: Santeria art exhibit fosters understanding of religion
Author: Lucy Orozco / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Akin Ogundiran, African New World Studies director, believes it's important to dispel misconceptions about the religion practiced mostly in the Caribbean and South Florida known as Santeria.

"Santeria is a growing religion that does not get enough exposure in the public eye," Ogundiran said. "People know it exists, but we want to inform the public on how it is a philosophy that is part of a culture."

The religion that merges the worship of West African Yoruba deities and Roman Catholic saints will have an art exhibition dedicated to its different aspects in the Biscayne Bay Campus on Sept. 7.

The event, taking place in the Wolfe University Center, was initiated as part of Ernesto Pichardo's honorary fellowship within ANWS.

Realizing that there have never been any events that describe Santeria through artwork, Pichardo, who teaches the Santeria and Transnational Perspectives course, decided to bring the genre to Miami.

"A couple of exhibitions on Santeria that have occurred throughout the years focused on artifacts and objects pertaining to the religion," Pichardo said. 

We wanted to make this exhibition unique and therefore narrowed it down to only paintings." 

The exhibit will consist of about 16 pieces of artwork from local artists that will present specific myths and deities that play a part in Santeria. They will include Elegua, Chango, Ochun and Yemaya. 

Mediums used to create the paintings included pencil, airbrush and ink.

Liza Lopez's art piece, Ikole, will be displayed in the exhibit. 

The piece will portray Ochun, the love goddess of the Osun River, surrounded by several buzzards during a drought. 

The painting reflects the legend of Ochun, who transforms into a buzzard and delivers the news of the drought to Olosin, the ultimate god and who in turn responds with rain.

Luis Molina is another local artist who will feature four large oil-on-canvas paintings at the exhibit. 

They will depict Iyabwo, the initiation into Santeria; Babalu, the deity for the dead; Ibeyes, the two boy messengers from god and Ochasi, the hunter deity.

Molina said he has always been fascinated with Santeria.

"An artist is born an artist and as a born Cuban artist, I wanted my paintings to focus strongly on Cuban culture, my favorite part of that culture being Santeria." Molina said.

Ogundiran, who also believes in celebrating African culture through ANWS, was highly supportive of the idea to organize an art exhibit. 

"It will expose the public to the aesthetics of Santeria," Ogundiran said. 

This will demonstrate to the audience, how artists are engaged and inspired by this religion." 

The exhibit is being presented and sponsored by ANWS, along with the Cuban Research Institute and the Department of Religious Studies as co-sponsors.

Headline: BEAT THE HEAT: Campus spots help students stay cool under the sun
Author: Lucia Sastre Pattarino / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With summer vacation over, most students forget that hot days still linger on until the end of September. Finding a cool spot at FIU may seem like a pretty hard task, but if one knows where to look, avoiding those hot and sticky moments can be a lot easier.



Campus Pools:
Located in University Park's housing quad, the Panther Hall Pool is open to all FIU students and staff. Although it may seem difficult at first to juggle classes and find time to walk over to the pool, students such as Sara Lopez find the trek rewarding.  

"Since I've been going to the pool during my free time, I've noticed a shift in my moods," Lopez said. "All of a sudden I feel happier and less uncomfortable. The horrible heat usually made me cranky and left me feeling like I needed to shower three times a day." 

The Biscayne Bay Campus has a pool of its own: a 50-meter olympic-sized one adjacent to the Wolfe University Center. According to the FIU Recreation Services web site, www.fiu.edu/~camprec, that pool is currently closed for repair and renovation.

Panther Hall Pool hours are Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays.



Starbucks:
For students who are tired of running to the water fountain, Starbucks is one option when seeking a flavorful drink.

With two Starbucks located on UP (one on the second floor of Bookstore and the other on the first floor of the Green Library), hundreds of students line up throughout the day to  grab a Frappuccino or iced coffee to stay cool and awake. 

"As soon as I walk into Starbucks, the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the cozy atmosphere instantly comforts me," said student Juan Mendez. "I love having a place to relax after a long day. Even the people that work there are friendly and efficient. The line always goes fast and I never have to wait too long."



Rocking Tables:
Hiding from the sun while still being outside is not impossible. The rocking tables located near the fountain between Primera Casa, the Graham Center and GL, are open to anyone regardless of time of day. The tables are highly popular, however, so students have to be in search of an empty one. Because of their covered roofs, the tables are an ideal location for students such as Carlos Ninao, who uses them for a daytime break.

"I usually take a 15 minute nap in these rocking tables - that gets me through the day and relaxes me," said Ninao. "The weather there is perfect."

A breeze usually swings by making it a perfect spot for having lunch or doing homework.



Green Library:
"Every time I walk into the Green Library, I can't help feeling alleviated and renovated," said student Felicia Rodriguez. "It is like jumping into a pool or strolling in the rain after a walk in the desert.

With spacious commodities, Green Library is the place to be when heat overpowers the air. With numerous computers and seating arrangements, Rodriguez nominates the Green Library as her destined spot for a hot summer day.  

"When I'm in a hurry to get some reading done, and I can't seem to find a spot outside due to the weather," she said. "I quickly stroll to the seventh floor of the library. The view from up there leaves you speechless, and the environment is perfect for studying.



Water Fountains:
Water is essential for survival, and it's especially helpful for these hot summer days. 

In nearly every building on campus, there are water fountains for thirsty students on the run. 

Business major Laura Menard finds the fountains useful because they are everywhere and allow her to refill her water bottle throughout the day without having to buy a new drink each time she's thirsty.  

"I love the fact that water is free," she said. "I don't want to be paying for water when you can actually find it free as you walk FIU ground.  I just bring my bottle from home and refill it every chance I get…can't get easier than that."

Headline: Internships key to finding job
Author: Shannon Fallon / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It's back to school time and many students are thinking about classes and enhancing their experience within the work field. 

According to business magazine Forbes, one of the best ways for college students to succeed and advance their careers is to work as an intern, which allows students the opportunity to build up their resumes, gain hands-on work experience and network.  

Lorenzo Rodriquez, a Communication major, interned for a semester with the Walt Disney World College Program in Orlando and met people from all over the globe. 

"I worked as a ride operator on the Indiana Jones ride at MGM Studios," he said. " My favorite part of my job was that I got to introduce the ride and give a little speech before the ride began …It was never boring. I mean, I would look next to me and Pluto was my co-worker. I got to live on my own and experience a real work life."

Although internships might not always involve working with your favorite cartoon character, they could be used as a stepping stone for an ideal job.  

Here are some ways college students have been landing internships and jobs:

Career Services, located in Graham Center Room 230, offers a variety of resources including resume critiquing, interview coaching, and opportunities to intern with prospective employers. 

The office provides students with two types of services: basic services and career success services; the latter requires a one time fee of $20 and provides wider access to resources for finding an immediate job. 

Career Services has particularly proven useful for those students who live in the residence halls with no means of transportation. 

"I live on campus and don't have a car this year," said freshman Daniel Martinez. "My financial aid barely covers my housing, so I need to make some extra cash. My peer advisor told me to look into career services for on campus work. So, right now they're helping me to get a job…" 

Aside from visiting Career Services, talk to students, professors and family who may be able to recommend you for an internship or help you find one -- you might be surprised by the people you know. 

According to career resource web site collegerecruiter.com, there are plenty of other ways to network outside of your immediate circle of family and friends. 

Attending industry events and joining job clubs are prime opportunities to find those who work in similar fields.

If you're interested in a company, visit their website. See if they offer internships or if they have any information regarding one. 

Also, look for career and internship based websites such as MonsterTRAK.com and Careerbuilder.com, both of which list full- and part-time internships. 

 If there's a company that you're interested in and they don't offer an internship, then offer your time a few hours a week as an unpaid intern. 

This works best with small or privately owned companies. 

"My friend's mom worked at a small public relations firm in Miami," said University of Miami student Cathy Cuenco said. 

"One day, my friend and I stopped in to drop off something to her mom, and I started talking to one of her co-workers and offered to help out in the office a few times a week free of charge so long as they would help me learn some office skills ... a few days later, I was interning as an assistant to the marketing director."

Headline: My Life! Experience: 'Love of the game' brings columnist to Las Vegas
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Las Vegas. We all think of going there, taking in the sights and winning it all on the strip. That wasn't why I was there, though. 

Not for the slots. Not for the roulettes or the blackjack tables or the other attractions Sin City has to offer. I was there from August 24-26 on the twilight of summer for one thing: EVO 2007.

The annual Evolution Championship Series is one of the top hot spots in video gaming competition for fighting games. Whether its old school, two-dimensional classics such as Super Street Fighter II Turbo or 3D placeholders such as Virtua Fighter 5, you'll find hundreds of top-notch players from all over the world hungry for wins, money and bragging rights. With big name sponsors like Capcom, EVO has become more than just a place to play games - it's become a grand spectacle for the gaming world. 

All around, players gathered to cheer, bet on matches or even challenge others to back up their skills with cold hard cash. Upon arriving at the tournament, it hit me that this event was tailor-made for Vegas. People can come to win or lose it all in EVO. I've talked about it with others. I've seen matches on Youtube. 

But this year, it was different. 

I was finally able to experience the Ninth EVO Championships in person: I had the opportunity to compete in EVO for Virtua Fighter 5. even if it was just to see how I'd fare compared to the rest of the world. 

Just waiting for a match to start was enough to make me uneasy about my skills as a player. I qualified for the semi-finals but didn't last too long after that. 

Considering some of my competition consisted of some of the top players from the United States and Japan, I had no regrets. At least I could say I did my best and I have all the reason to come back next year even better.

Of course, the trip wasn't all just for the thrill of digital combat and the $5000 pot for 1st place. I finally had the chance to meet people I've talked to through the internet for years face to face and play casual matches in games that only few have even heard of and exchange stories. 

This is what it was about. These were people like me who saw video games as more than just a fad or a pasttime. It was something understood on another level that few can relate to 

Some have been to this very event for years to either face victory or defeat in a matter of minutes that could seem like an eternity with thousands of eyes watching every move. As fun as the environment is, it can get crazy like any other sport where just about anything can happen. 

You name it. Close calls. Clutch plays. Upsets. It's all there and why? 

For love of the game and victory.

I didn't know what to expect when I first came to Vegas and my 1st EVO, but now I can only wonder when and if I'll ever get to come back to fight next year, providing my game of choice is offered as a major tourney and even then, just to see the same faces and the same minds that think as I do. 

And maybe, just maybe, I'll leave Las Vegas with a fatter wallet.

Headline: Professor leaves after 35 years
Author: Andrew Leins / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Not only is Howard Rock an American History professor, he has brought about change as a member of the Faculty Senate. He has most recently taken part in a lawsuit against the Florida Legislature over the control of the state's public universities' tuition.

"The tuition increase that was vetoed by Governor [Charlie] Christ amounted to $10 per course, that's like one trip to McDonald's. The universities in Florida are under funded and a tuition increase will help students," Rock said.

Aside from serving on the Faculty Senate for 25 years, Rock was also on the FIU Board of Trustees and the Florida Board of Governors from 2003 to 2004. He did this because he wanted different focuses throughout his life. Rock will be retiring after this Spring; he plans to spend his retirement writing another book on the history of New York in the time of Jefferson, among other things. 

"I have the greatest respect for what Professor Rock has done. He has been an extremely effective spokesperson for the faculty and universities at the local, as well as the statewide level," said Bruce Hauptli, chair of the Faculty Senate and professor of philosophy.

Rock also founded the Faculty Club in the Graham Center where all faculty members can socialize together. 

"I always tried to give a voice to faculty; I tried to create an academic community where the faculty wasn't isolated in their departments," Rock said.

As a professor at FIU for 35 years, Rock tries to open up student's minds.

"I try to assign them books that will stimulate their intellect, it doesn't always work, but sometimes it does," Rock said. But working with students to get them interested in history can be "an uphill struggle."

Rock began teaching at FIU in its second year, when the FIU only had two buildings, Primera Casa and Deuxieme Maison.

Rock has published five books, including his latest, Cityscapes: A History of New York in Images, published in 2001. Rock said the money he made from his most commercially successful book was equivalent to minimum wage after all the time that he put into writing it. 

"You don't get into academics for the money," Rock said. "The best part of being an academic is that you live a life of the mind, you get to read and learn while earning a living." 

Rock says it's important to teach students about American History.

"I always felt that to know history was to know yourself, history is identity," Rock said.  

Throughout his years at FIU, Rock has gained the esteem of his fellow colleagues. 

"He's extremely professional, but he also has a great sense of humor, he's able to take things in stride that other faculty members may get uptight about, he can laugh things off," said Professor Brian Peterson, a colleague of Rock's in the History Department who was among the committee that hired him in 1972.

Headline: Women's mentoring program provides guidance
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Living in what seems to be a man's world, the Women's Center at FIU is working to give female students an upper hand through their Mentoring Partnerships Program.

The program is meant to provide female students at FIU with a sense of belonging at the University, networking opportunities, as well as provide guidance and support for the student with their current schooling and future career choices. 

"The value of a mentor relationship is that it differs from one with a professor, advisor or friend," said Bronwen Bares, coordinator for the Women's Center and the Center for Leadership. "You can get friendly [with your mentor] but you can also gain experience in things that interest you."

The program matches students to mentors based on the student's career goals, the mentor's experience in a career that interests the student and life experiences. 

The pairing also takes into account technical factors, such as convenience to meet at the University Park or Biscayne Bay campus. Pairs are required to meet at least once a month, but can meet as often as the couple deems necessary.

"Once we get the pairs together, it's really up to them. We just facilitate the matching," Bares said.

There will be an information session for UP participants on Sept. 21 and a Mentoring Gala on Sept. 26. 

The events are for students to meet with their mentors, discuss their goal and to network. BBC will not be holding any formal events, but are welcome to attend the events at UP.

Though not new, the program is gaining attention according to Raquel Wright, a graduate assistant for the Women's Center. There is no application for the program because everyone is accepted and there is no capacity limit.

Mentors will include chief financial officers, FIU professors and more, according to a Women's Center advertisement for the program. All female FIU students qualify as mentees for the program.

Wright would like to encourage all eligible students to take advantage of the program. Wright is taking a bit of her own advice, and joining as a mentee.

"I had the option to be a mentor, but for me, being a new student … this is a new transition for me, so I think it'd be good to have a mentor to get adjusted," Wright said.

Interested students can obtain an involvement form at www.fiu.edu/~women. 

The deadline to return the forms is Sept. 14 at 4 p.m. For more information call the Women's Center at 305-348-1506.

FIU:
Faculty Senate approves Honorary Degrees for terminally-ill students



The Faculty Senate approved Sept. 4 issuing Honorary Degrees to terminally-ill students in good standing who have achieved senior status.

The new degree will allow students who are unable to complete their remaining degree requirements to receive an Honorary Degree if recommended by their department and dean.

The decision to change the guidelines under which Honorary Degrees are given follows a request last summer by a student with a terminal disease who asked for her degree to be issued. While the University would have issued a post-mortem degree, the student asked for a degree ceremony to be held before her death.

"This will give degrees to ill students while allowing departments to protect their degrees," said Maureen Donnelly, professor of biology sciences.

Headline: FINANCIAL FIASCO: Financial aid falls short in
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The lines, the wait for reimbursement and the urgent need to pay tuition in fear of being dropped from classes can become a nightmare for students who deal with the Office of Financial Aid.

Away on vacation and lacking access to the Internet, Jonny Garcia, a junior, was unaware his application for financial aid was unprocessed and incomplete. 

Since the Office of Financial Aid never told him he was missing paperwork, Garcia was dropped from all his classes. 

The damage to his schedule was irreparable and it was up to Garcia to pick up the pieces. 

He was left with no choice but to re-enroll in all his classes, which by then were all full.

It seems the Office of Financial Aid is doing just about everything wrong: flawed customer service, poor communication with students, over-complicated application processes, and long waits to fix problems

For example, why make students wait in line just to turn in a few sheets of paper with some signatures? 

According to Garcia, there were a few more students waiting in line for the same reason. 

Rather than having students make the long line, they could have an inbox where students can simply drop their documents, to be collected and processed throughout the day. 

Lines would be shorter and students who have been dropped from classes can instead use the time they spend waiting to fix their schedules.

No e-mails were sent to notify Garcia about his situation. 

He had to dig into Panthersoft to find out what was going on with his tuition payment. 

"If someone has never been to Panthersoft they would never know about the 'To Do List' [feature in the software].

 "People might think they can create an agenda for themselves or something" he said. 

But as far as sending students e-mails goes, it seems the Financial Aid office is inconsistent with its methods. 

I remember receiving an e-mail from them sometime in the Spring semester telling me what papers I had to turn in for my money to be disbursed for the fall. 

But why didn't Garcia receive a similar e-mail? 

It's because the Office of Financial Aid doesn't stick to one consistent method of notifying students of the status of their financial aid application

There isn't one consistent place where students can go to find out if their application's missing something. 

Students can't know if they have a hold on their account unless they're persistent enough in periodically checking Panthersoft.

Most FIU students work either part time or full time while managing to study full time.

 Students need to design their schedules in advance and resolve any conflicts that arise between school and work. 

The Office of Financial Aid may or may not be aware of this but they can do serious damage to a student when they decide to drop all of his or her classes.

It wouldn't hurt to figure out a way to work with, and not against, students when it comes to resolving financial aid issues.  

As Garcia suggested, there are better ways to handle these cases. 

"Can't financial aid give you the option to hold your classes until you pay either your tuition in full or a certain amount to keep those classes?" 

We are all here to receive an education to start a career in the near future. 

But to get an education at  FIU, students must also invest their efforts on jumping bureaucratic hurdles while managing to  not drop their baton, or in this case, their classes.

 The amount of red tape there is to trip over at FIU puts students at a disadvantage from the race's start.

Classes are hard enough. Administrative red tape shouldn't make getting an education even harder than it already is.

Headline: Editorial: FIU complies, reveals names
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The Recording Industry Association of America sent 433 pre-lawsuit letters to university students in late April. Sixteen of the letters were sent to FIU.

The RIAA figured out the 16 students' Internet Protocol and MAC addresses that they used on FIU's wireless network. The RIAA approached FIU with the addresses and the university turned over the students' identities after a subpoena was issued.

There's certainly room for debating whether file sharing should really be illegal, and even whether it's right for the RIAA to collect settlement money on behalf of artists.

But it's not really up to FIU to arbitrate that debate. FIU's actions in turning over the students' identities to the RIAA were appropriate. As a public institution, it must comply with copyright laws, regardless of any philosophical debates on file sharing.

As far as the 16 students who received the letters go, they got what was coming to them. 

Illegal file sharing is wrong, plain and simple. What makes it even worse is that these students were using public resources to engage in illegal activities. 

As a public university, FIU is an extension of the state - the same state that makes the laws and enforces them. 

If you carry out illegal activity using a state-owned network and you get caught, well, you asked for it.

Headline: Editorial: Football team's success should be measured in future, not present
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Penn State welcomed new head football coach Mario Cristobal and his staff with a 59-0 loss Sept. 1. 

Though the loss was a whooping, it is what fans, students, faculty and alumni should expect; especially coming from a young team with an inexperienced coaching staff. 

The following three games should offer no different outcome since they come against established football programs: Maryland, Kansas and the University of Miami. When witnessing the struggles and shortcomings of the team this year, one should look to the glimmers of hope that each game produces because the success of the program hinges on the future, not the present.

It's obvious that Athletic Director Pete Garcia and Cristobal are building this team for the future. With success comes not only glory and veneration, but money; Athletics gives a university a face and platform,  as well as a means of generating profit for a university that's already tight for money. 

Money received from alumni donations can help fund other programs and schools, not just Athletics. 

With such a heavy emphasis being placed on football - $31 million dollar stadium, new coaches and better training facilities - students, faculty, administration and alumni will be looking for the investment's return immediately. Hopefully it will come sooner  rather than later.

Headline: Men's Soccer: Team fails to win home-opening series
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Men's soccer opened their 2007 campaign at home against Bowling Green State University Falcons (1-0-1) Aug. 31 and Missouri-Kansas City Kangaroos (2-0-0) Sept. 2 at University Park.

Both games were offensive droughts fueled by missed scoring opportunities. New head coach Munga Eketebi did not coach the second game due to a funeral service.



FIU 0, BGSU 0 2 (OT)



The men's team began the season making numerous inaccurate passes coupled with lack of conditioning. 

Early on, new head coach Munga Eketebi made substitutions to keep his players fresh. For the most part, the Golden Panthers' passes were too strong and inaccurate. The rusty play from both teams resulted in a defensive struggle, and neither team could capitalize on the few scoring possibilities. 

The closest the Golden Panthers came to scoring was when freshman midfielder had the ball inside the penalty box and did not manage to make contact with the ball. Following his initial miss, he was not able to recover in time to score.

The Falcons' twin brothers Ryan and Alec Perea nearly connected on a pass and shot that hit off the left crossbar. The two teams continued to apply defensive pressure into double overtime, when fatigue dominated the players' offensive game. The second overtime concluded with a 0-0 tie.

"This is a game that we should win," said head coach Munga Eketebi.



FIU 1, UMKC 2



The Golden Panthers once again failed to produce enough offense to overcome two opposing goals. 

Freshman David Stovall had a clear path to the goal before he stumbled and tripped on the ball. The goal would prove to be essential to the offensively starved club.

On the other hand, the Kangaroos took advantage of two penalty kicks awarded to them in the first half. 

The Golden Panthers responded in the second half with sophomore midfielder Juan Guerra setting up  frshman Steven Jair Cabas with a corner kick that was deflected by the Kangaroos. 

Following the deflection, freshman  Cabas shot the ball inside the box and scored his first collegiate game.

The team's energy increased after the goal, but not enough to penetrate the Kangaroos defense to tie the game as the Golden Panther suffered their first loss of the season 2-1 to the undefeated Kangaroos.

Headline: Commentary: Panthers call Orange Bowl new home
Author: Adam Wasch / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Walking to class last week, I noticed the football team practicing on the new, yet unfinished, FIU Recreation Fields. The sounds of football practice - coaches' whistles, players yelling in unison and linemen exploding into blocking sleds - ripped through the air. 

The sounds of practice are the only ones that will be heard on FIU's campus this season as construction crews continue working to turn "The Cage" into a brand new, state-of-the-art football stadium complete with club seating, luxury suites and The Panther Club. In the meantime, FIU will play all five of its 2007 home games at the Orange Bowl.

I thought to myself: Can the football team be successful without a true home-field advantage? Can the team defend the house of a cross-town rival? 

First, we can forget about any home field advantage that the old FIU Stadium provided to the team. "The Cage" was a glorified high school football stadium. The

"advantage" has simply never existed. FIU had the 10th lowest average attenance in all of Division I-A football over the last two seasons according to the Indianapolis Star. 

In fact, the 2005 and 2006 two-year attendance average of 15,170 (15,147 and 15,193 respectively) was just a shade above the requisite 15,000 that each school needs to keep Division I-A eligibility. 

With nothing to lose after a winless 2006 campaign and a $31 million football facility on its way, new head coach Mario Cristobal and his football team have an opportunity to win some games in a football stadium ripe with history - even if that stadium is the home of the Canes.

The Orange Bowl is well past its prime as a premier football venue. The University of Miami has decided that the 2007 season will be its last season at the historic stadium. 

The Canes will begin play at the newly renovated Dolphins Stadium in 2008, as the Florida Marlins and the city of Miami are in the planning stages to convert the Orange Bowl grounds into a baseball only facility for the team.  

With the Canes gone, this will likely be the last season of football played at the Orange Bowl after 70 years of storied football.

Opened in 1937, the Orange Bowl has hosted five Super Bowls, the Miami Dolphins from 1966 until 1987, and the Miami Hurricanes to this day. The stadium seats 72,319.

The FIU players will call "home" the same field that football legends Joe Namath and Franco Harris have once played on. head coach Cristobal will walk the same sidelines that legendary coaches Bear Bryant, Joe Paterno and Lou Holtz have roamed. 

Take away the history of the Orange Bowl and you have a decaying mass of rusted metal that many Miami residents consider an eyesore. That eyesore, however, is a drastic upgrade for the FIU faithful, who have been relegated to "The Cage" since the inception of the football program. FIU should be proud to call the OB "home." 

And in a strange turn of events, FIU will be the last team to call the historic Orange Bowl "home," as UM plays their last home game of the season on Nov. 10, and while FIU continues to play there until the season finale against North Texas on Dec. 1. 

Second, the players should relish in the fact that they are playing in a true college football stadium even if it lacks the modern amenities found in most stadiums around the country. 

The stadium is in the heart of Miami and will be imposing for opponents coming in from cities like Lafayette, Louisiana and Denton, Texas. It's not like FIU has to travel to the Gables and set up shop on UM's campus.

It is possible that the Orange Bowl will be destroyed after the college season ends. If so, FIU and UM will say farewell to the college football relic. Whether the OB is destroyed or whether it is an upgrade from "The Cage," is an uncertainty. 

One thing is sure, the OB is the Golden Panthers' home this season.

Headline: Women's Volleyball: Club finds success after second tournament away from home

&nbsp;
The women's volleyball team is the first fall sport to win a game for FIU this season. The team recorded a 24-8 record in 2006, and have begun their 2007 season away from home until Sept. 14.

The team is currently riding due to a come from behind upset victory over hosts Missouri at the Tiger Invitational this past Sunday. After dropping the first two sets, the Golden Panthers rallied for a 3-2 (18-30, 22-30, 30-24, 30-27, 18-16) victory against a Missouri squad ranked 20th in the nation. 

However, just the day before, they didn't  show up in what should have been an easy game against a less-talented Notre Dame squad- dropping that match 3-2 (28-30, 30-27, 21-30, 30-24, 15-9). 

On the tail end of the short roller coaster ride over the weekend, head coach Tomic talked about the importance of maintaining a level of excellence. 

"We were not consistent at all, and I believe that was our downfall last year as well. We played great one game like we had six All-Americans out there for us, and then in the other game we had a let down," said Tomic. "Championship teams play at a high level all of the time and you can't have let downs if you want to get to that level. We are working on building that consistency and we will continue to do so throughout the season," she said.

Picking up right where she left off last season, sophomore All-American Yarimar Rosa was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player, and sophomore Olga Vergun joined her on the all-tournament squad. 

Against Missouri, Rosa put in season-high 31-kills, and collected 15 digs for her second double-double of the young season. Vergun was no slouch either as her 22-kill performance cemented her spot on the all-tourney team. 

Newcomer 17-year-old freshman setter Natalia Valentin was unflappable in her first career start with 64 assists and 19 digs. Another freshman, Ines Medved also showed that she is ready for the collegiate game with 14 kills and 14 digs of her own. 

Anita Szymanska did her part with 12 kills and Senior Alyse Santisi had a team-season high 21 digs in the win. 

Tomic says she expected both for her star players to show up and for the supporting cast to have her back.

"Yarimar is a coach's dream. She is a true team player, and a gifted athlete that always rises to the occasion for us. We know that when we need somebody to make a difficult play we can go to her," she said. 

"We played the best three games so far for the season and I am very happy to see the level of desire and teamwork that our players showed. All of the starters are back from last year and it is a big advantage for us," she added.

Although all three teams finished with identical 1-1 records, Missouri won by virtue of total games won and lost at a 5-3 mark. The Golden Panthers were 5-5, and Notre Dame finished under .500 at 3-5.

Next up, the Golden Panthers will tackle the Stetson Invitational on September 8th in Deland Florida, with games slated against Stetson and Oral Roberts. Look for the Golden Panthers to handle Stetson, but the game against the defending champion Oral Roberts, will be anything but easy.

Coach Tomic may continue to toy with the starting lineup a bit, interchanging the young Valentin, and veteran setter Keila Oliveira to see what works better against different defenses. But stay tuned; if history is an indicator, anything could happen in the quest for consistency.

&nbsp;
Coming off the worst margin of defeat in school history, a 59-0 drubbing at the hands of Penn State, the Golden Panthers will come home to take on yet another  formidable opponent, the University of Maryland Terrapins.

Despite last week's poor performance, teh Golden Panthers' defense managed  to find success to begin the game.

The defense played well on first and second downs and on offense Wayne Younger did pass for over 100 yards. However, the Panthers turned the ball over five times, gave up 549 total yards and rushed for negative three yards.

Despite what happened against Penn State, the Golden Panthers can come into the Maryland game with more confidence. This game will be played at the Orange Bowl against a familiar team who FIU almost defeated last season in a narrow 10-14 loss in College Park, MD.

In last seasons game, the Panthers saw a late lead slip through their hands, as a last second interception in the end zone ended what would have been the biggest upset in FIU history.

FIU will need to shutdown Maryland's run attack led by Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore, who rushed for a combined 158 yards in a 31-14 win over Villanova last week. 

The Terrapins also have a strong passing game led by quarterback Jordan Steffy, who completed 19 of 24 passes and passed for 178 yards. Steffy also gained 45 yards rushing on eight carries, including a 10-yard touchdown run.

After turning the ball over five times and fumbling six, the Panthers must avoid more turnovers.

 Cornerback Lionell Singleton was responsible for three of these fumbles and must protect the ball better in the future. 

The ground game will also need to gain a lot more than negative three yards if they hope to win. 

The secondary needs to get on the same page because against Penn State they gave up over 300 passing yards. Offensively, the Panthers will be facing a defense that only gave up one touchdown last week.  

After the loss to Penn State, head coach Mario Cristobal went on to say, "We made the typical young team errors. We gave the ball up in our own territory when we showed early on that we could do some things to kind of irritate their offense. We have to go back and make sure that we coach better, that we play better, make sure that our young guys play like they are older guys."

Headline: Faculty Senate: Professors discuss schedule
Author: Maria Chercoles / News Director
&nbsp;
The first Faculty Senate meeting of the school year, on Sept. 4, revealed that students are not the only ones having concerns and inconveniences adapting to the new three-day schedule. 

The mixed feelings followed Corinne Webb's report. As vice president of enrollment management and also chair of the new schedule implementation committee, she supervised the transition to the three-day schedule. 

 Although the new classroom utilization rate is not available yet, Webb said it is estimated to be around 54 percent. This is much higher than the 42 percent rate calculated in Fall 2005, which ranked lowest in the State.

In her presentation, Webb mentioned that the higher classroom utilization rate was achieved by asking departments to have 60 percent of their classes Monday-Wednesday-Friday and the other 40 percent Tuesday and Thursdays. Departments were also asked to have 75 percent of their classes during daytime hours. 

Despite the success in adapting the new schedule, some professors had questions about its efficacy.

Such was the case for Professor Dev Roy, associate professor at the Department of Mathematics, who said that 50 minute slots - when compared to the former 75 minute slots - is not enough time to teach because some students arrive late and others leave earlier.  He also expressed some of his students' concerns about the new schedule:

"My students also complain about the 50 minute slots when they spend more time driving here and looking for parking than actually sitting in class," Roy said.

Roy and other professors in the Senate pointed out that this might be one of the reasons why Tuesday and Thursday classes seem to be more popular.

Assistant Professor Pip Brant agreed with Roy and added that her students also complain about time constraint problems. 

Brant added that FIU's classroom utilization rate should not be compared with other Florida universities because, opposite to them, FIU is a commuter university.

"We are being compared with small town college universities. For us who commute long distances, coming here three times a week is a big change," Brant said. 

Dawn Addy, director of the Labor Center in the education department, expressed similar concerns. She spoke about how the new schedule interferes with the nature of the department of education, which requires field work, research and observation outside FIU. Students now have to come to the University an extra day, Addy said, spending more time driving and away from their research location.

"Will there be any way for colleges to appeal the new schedule?" Addy said.

Webb answered that some departments have been granted more flexibility to meet their specific needs and added that, currently, 52 percent of classes are under the new three-day schedule, meaning that almost half of the classes still meet twice or just once a week.

While Webb could not provide solutions to every concern, she told the Senate that she expects more questions to arise in the future. 

"As more questions come up, I will present options and we'll address the problems," Webb said.

Headline: FIU College of Medicine opening postponed
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Governor Charlie Crist announced his outline for the $1.1 billion in state budget cuts today. (Sep. 6) The cuts include the elimination and postponements of many state programs. Several of the line items are specific to FIU including the postponement of the College of Medicine opening and funds for hurricane mitigation research.

"This is a major issue only because these were funds already appropriated and approved," said Viviana Jordan the director of legislative affairs for the Student Government Council at University Park. "This is money we were already counting on."

SGC-UP was informed of the budget cuts after the Miami Herald ran a late-breaking story on their website. 

See our Sep. 10 issue for a complete update on Governor Crist's outline for the state budget cuts.
