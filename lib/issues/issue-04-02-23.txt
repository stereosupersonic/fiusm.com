Headline: Students lip sync for charity
Author: Erika Taveras/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's annual Dance Marathon, a compilation of events organized to raise money for charity, kicked off Feb. 17 with a lip-sync show that has been a huge success for the past three years.  

The lip-sync show, in addition to the other events that take place for Dance Marathon, raises money for the Miami Children's Hospital Foundation and the Children's Miracle Network.  

Dance Marathon raised approximately $100,000 for these charities last year.

The lip-sync show was all about performances complete with costumes, props, choreography, karaoke acts and lots of energy.  

The show included acts such as guys in tights working up a sweat as they performed an aerobic workout, green-colored people dancing and singing along to the Britney Spears song "Toxic," and, to top it off, a very vibrant lip-sync performance of Outkast's "Hey Ya" served as the finale.

 The show not only entertained and hyped up the crowd, but managed to raise a substatntial amount of money for the children's charities. 

David Medina, SPC assistant director of funding, said Tuesday night's lip-sync show brought in a little more than $1,000.  

This is the seventh year FIU organizations get together to help raise money for the Miami Children's Hospital, said Maria Garcia, the Dance Marathon director.  

"It's a great ride. That's what we're here for; the kids that need our help," Garcia said. 

This year's show consisted of seven acts.  The organizations that performed included: Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Mu, Pi Kappa Alpha, Delta Phi Epsilon, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Alpha Xi Delta, Sigma Alpha Mu, Phi Sigma Sigma, and Panther Rage. 

At the end of the lip sync show, a panel of judges ranked the best three acts.  

Sigma Phi Epsilon's performance came in third place and Alpha Xi Delta and Sigma Alpha Mu placed in second. 

Phi Mu and Pi Kappa Alpha won first place for their show-stealing performance.

Dance Marathon, which will take place April 3 - 4, will finalize this fund-raiser.

Considered the nation's largest student-run philanthropic organization, Dance Marathon is a 25-hour event in which more than 200 students participate in all kinds of activities which aid the children of Miami who are in need of special medical attention. 

The hospital will receive all of the proceeds. 

The money will benefit different programs organized by Miami Children's Hospital such as the Division of Preventive Medicine.  

Ways of getting involved with Dance Marathon include partaking in one of these things:  being a dancer, moraler, security guard, volunteer, or a part of the subcommittee.  

Dancers must raise $150 and stay active for all 25 hours.

Moralers are responsible for keeping participants hyped and motivated throughout the marathon.  

The subcommittee plans and markets the event. A minimum of $50 must be raised in order to help in this area. 

Greeks and other school organizations mostly partake in the events said Manny Rosa, DM advisor.  

"We had a lot of different Greek organizations participating in the lip sync," said Jessica Franchi-Alfaro, the family relations chair for the DM committee.

Headline: Career Fair offers internship, job opportunities
Author: Matthew Wright/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When you graduate, will you have more to show than just a college degree? 

Backing up a degree with strong references and work experience can help make the transition to the workforce much easier. 

Fortunately, FIU and the Career Services department can help. The Biscayne Bay Campus will be hosting  a Career and Internship Fair and Graduate School Open House Feb. 25 in the Wolfe University Center Ballrooms.

More than 70 different companies and several corporate sponsors such as Anheuser-Busch, Inc., The Avante Group, Enterprise Rent-A-Car and Steak and Shake will vist FIU. 

Some students feel this event will help them see what is available after graduation. 

"I plan to attend, because I am interested in finding an internship," said Karen Collazo, a senior majoring in advertising, and AdScene president.

Because this is a career fair that emphasizes professionalism, students will also be encouraged to wear proper business attire when attending the event. 

"I don't mind getting dressed up for the event, it shows professionalism within myself," said Jorge Abreu, a sophomore majoring in psychology.

Making that first impression memorable could be the deciding factor when employers have to decide between several applicants.

According to Career Services, students who attend are highly encouraged to bring several copies of their up-to-date resume to give to whichever potential companies  they are interested in.

The Career Fair will be sure to have something to offer to all students, no matter their year in school or what career path they plan on pursuing. 

"The Career Fair is definitely growing. Last year, we only had about 50 companies. This year there is a lot more diversity, especially with all the corporate sponsors," said Craig Cunningham, Career Services associate director. 

Although many companies are interested in all kinds of majors, certain companies like  MTV Networks Latin America will be looking to fill several positions within accounting, advertising, economics, international business, marketing, television management and production. 

"I didn't get to go to last year's Career Fair but it seems like this year they have really gone out of their way to have something for everyone," said Alex Marillo, a junior majoring in engineering.

Although many students plan on attending the fair, some say that their current jobs and lack of time will keep them from fitting it into their busy schedules. 

"I work full time, so I won't have time to go to the Career Fair," Marillo said. 

An alternative for students who wish to attend the fair but can't make it, would be to visit the Career Services department  in WUC 255 at any other time. 

Career Services provides students with career counseling appointments, job listings, mock interviews, resume critiques, and information on future career fairs and forums. 

This gives those students who have limited amounts of free time the chance to utilize career-oriented options within the confines of their own schedule.

The Career Fair not only gives students the opportunity to network with potential employers but also meet their career goals.  

"I hope that this Career Fair can help students make that connection to help meet their career needs," Cunningham said.

Headline: Harvard professor cites Bush-Castro economic alliance
Author: Sean Nicolle/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Here's more food for thought for the upcoming election. Jorge Dominguez, a professor at Harvard  University, lectured on the topic of a Bush-Castro alliance on Feb. 19 at Univerasity Park's International Pavillion.

Dominguez suggests an alliance exists between Fidel Castro and President Bush, as well as  other previous American presidents, in which the Cuban and American governments can benefit economically  from one another.

One of the topics Dominguez spoke of was Bush's breaching of the Helms-Burton Act, which was signed into law in March of 1996. The bill enforces the 40-year-old embargo  against Cuba and punishes foreign companies "trafficking in property confiscated by the Castro regime." 

Dominguez said "Every six months, the president of the United States, George W. Bush, ... has  suspended the application of the single-most important feature of the Helms-Burton Act, which is title three. 

"If it were allowed to go into effect, it will allow those whose property was seized in  Cuba by the Castro government to litigate in U.S. federal district courts for compensation."

Also discussed was America's economic relationship with Cuba. Dominguez explained the breaching  of the embargo act by Bush. 

"The official number for last year is about $340 million of agricultural imports from the United States, which would mean that the United States alone  accounts for about one-sixth of Cuba's overall imports, and probably would rank second as the source of  imports for Cuba." 

Natalia Martinez, 17, a high school senior and Cuban immigrant, said the lecture posed questions she hadn't asked herself.

Williams,  a senior majoring in international relations said "it was impartial, but I don't know if it's necessary. I don't  know how meaningful it is." When asked if the lecture would affect their votes, both students said it would not.

Dominguez  has published many books on Cuban affairs, including the classic "Cuba, Order, And Revolution." His two most recently published books are  "The United States and Mexico. Between Partnership and Conflict" and "Toward Mexico's  Democratization: Parties, Campaigns, Elections and Public Opinion."

Headline: Men's basketball routed, falls to 0-10 in conference play
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU came up short yet again in its quest for its first conference victory of the year, falling hard on the road to Arkansas State, 82-57, on Feb. 16.

The Golden Panthers were plagued by first-half mistakes, committing 17 turnovers and hitting only five of 16 first-half field goal attempts. 

But FIU's biggest problem was ASU guard DeWarick Spencer, who scored a game-high 30 points and knocked down eight of 12 three-point attempts.

"That guy [Spencer] was just hot from everywhere. He took turns on each one of us - even when we were playing zone against him," said FIU guard Marcus Robinson.

ASU outscored FIU 29-7 to end the first half and took a 42-15 lead into half time. Spencer (17 points) alone outscored the entire Golden Panthers team (15) entering the intermission.	

"Coming out to start the game, we looked intimidated, so I called an early timeout to try to settle things down and make some adjustments," Marsh said. "But they just kept coming at us and we had no answer for Spencer, who was getting a lot of uncontested shots. That was probably the most disappointing aspect of that first half."
	
The second half proved to be a different story for FIU. The Golden Panthers outscored the Indians 42-40 despite ASU's 60 percent shooting. After shooting poorly in the first half, FIU improved to 45 percent in the second half and shot a perfect eight for eight from the free throw line.

But FIU's chances of a comeback ended when ASU, already up 56-40 with 9:24 to go, went on a seven point run, increasing its lead to 23 points and putting the game out of reach. The Indians hit 13 three-pointers in the game, tying the season-high mark in Sun Belt Conference play this season.

"We committed too many turnovers and just came out flat. We played with more heart in the second half as we outscored them, but the deficit was too big to overcome," Robinson said. "We usually play pretty good defense, but in this game we just didn't play as good at defense as we are capable of."

But despite the poor defensive showing, FIU's inability to score points ultimately cost the team the game. With Taurance Johnson removed from the team and Carlos Morban and Harry Lum out as well, FIU was forced to tinker with its lineup once again.

"We have experimented with lineup changes but no matter whatever line goes out to play, we always come out a little flat and the result is always the same - a loss," Robinson said.

Robinson led FIU with 18 points and three assists. Raphael daSilva added 11 as the only other Golden Panther to reach double digits.

Center Belco Bamba committed a team-high seven turnovers. Warren Gale and Byron Burnett combined for 15 points and six rebounds. 

The loss dropped FIU to 4-19 on the season and 0-10 in Sun Belt Conference play.

Headline: The Dreamers: Naked people can't save flick
Author: Chris Hewitt / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Like cocaine and Mark Geragos, "The Dreamers" is destined to attract the wrong crowd.

The first NC-17 movie in years, it promises a cornucopia of naked, youthful flesh. If it's female flesh you're after, "The Dreamers" delivers, but it isn't particularly erotic. In fact, the grappling and moistening that happens - between Eva Green, Michael Pitt and Louis Garrel as three naifs who take a walk on the oo-la-la side in late-`60s Paris - is dull.

Garrel and Green are vaguely incestuous, precociously bored siblings who befriend wide-eyed American Pitt and, by "befriend," I mean feed him, strip him and invite him to become part of their isolated, experimental, we-are-two-halves-of-the-same-person world. Oddly, Pitt traveled a similarly fractured, psychosexual road in "Hedwig and the Angry Inch."

Director Bernardo Bertolucci ("Last Tango in Paris") means for this to be both naughty and innocent, and it is. But, no matter how many mirrors he uses to fracture his characters into meaningful multiple images or how many shots he includes of losing people control, he can't make the naughty innocence compelling. 

Errors in casting don't help. Green is a sultry powerhouse with a commanding presence, but both men come off as whiny boys.

What's most interesting about these dreamers is the way they use favorite movies such as "Breathless" and "Shock Corridor" to escape from and, ultimately enter into real life. It's a neat notion, but the movie doesn't adequately explore it and, frankly, you'd have a lot better time if you watched those movies instead of "The Dreamers."

Headline: Suicide Club: Quirky import's message lost in gory monsoon
Author: Maggie Perez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The opening scene of "Suicide Club" involves 54 Japanese school girls marching down a subway stairwell. They  join hands and jump in front of an on-coming express train. The horrified onlookers are  drenched with blood.

Thus begins Sion Sono's  unconventional thriller with an underlined satirical theme that seems to be lost within all the gore and bloodshed the movie offers.

After the shocking opening scene, the local police lead an investigation into the suicide, trying to decide whether it really was a suicide or perhaps some form of murder. 

Soon after, more suicides are reported in the city, causing chaos in the police department. Inspector Kuroda (Ryo Ishibashi) receives a phone call from a mysterious source named "The Bat," which tells him that there is a website that displays the number of suicides that will happen before they even occur. Curious, he opens the Web page only to find hundreds of blinking dots staring at him. The red dots are the female victims and the white represent the males. 

The movie descends into even more eeriness with the introduction of a psychotic group of delinquents, who look like a mix of characters from "Rocky Horror Picture Show" and "Clockwork Orange" and insist they are the true masterminds behind the suicides.

Sadly, the biting message the movie has about Japanese culture and the growing apathy amongst the teenagers is lost under the gallons of fake blood. 

Sono criticizes the obsession Japanese culture has with fads and consumerism by showing how  teens are mesmerized by a pop group named Dessert and the growing number of self-sacrifices. For example, in one scene, several classmates decide to throw themselves off a roof. None of them were angst-ridden or suicidal, their objective was simply to beat the 54 girls from the subway. 

Perhaps the message of the movie is that having love for yourself and others fills the void  we sometimes occupy with pop culture, music, movies and fashion. 

In this film, the schism between the children and the adults is so large there is no way for them to understand each other. 

Sono does not offer answers to all the questions and the movie will leave the audience in wonder. In fact, the fierce bloodshed, strange questions, and storylines that are never understood or developed may even bury the entire message of the movie. 

"Suicide Club" should leave the audience questioning themselves and, hopefully, will inspire endless discussion on the matter. What is sweeter than figuring out a film on your own?

Headline: Jerusalem Market & Deli brings Middle Eastern flavors to North Miami
Author: Diane Mooney / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The politicians crafting the road map to peace might want to make a detour to North Miami. There, at Jerusalem Market and Deli, they'd find Arabs, Israelis, Argentineans, Cubans and other Miami polyglots noshing on Middle Eastern delicacies in perfect chow harmony. Owner Wissam "Sam" Elzoor presides over this peaceable kingdom of food, running the cash register, manning the grill, and serving up specialties like shawerma, spinach pie and shish kabab. 

Elzoor is originally from Lebanon, a country whose culinary contributions have been the greatest influence on modern Middle Eastern cuisine. Israelis and Palestinians may argue over borders but they eat the same food as their Lebanese neighbors. 

Lamb and chicken grilled on skewers, chickpeas and eggplant, plenty of pita bread and everything cooked in olive oil with parsley, lemon, onion and garlic. 

The spelling of the dishes may vary from country to country but the food speaks the same language.

Jerusalem Market offers the savory Middle Eastern dishes. Sandwiches come on pita bread, one of the oldest baked foods known to mankind. Also called pocket bread, it is split and stuufed with shawerma, a roasted mixture of beef and lamb; kafta, ground lamb and spices; or for the vegetarian, falafel, a deep-fried ball of spicy chickpeas. Each sandwich includes, tahina, a tangy paste made from crushed sesame seeds, and green salad, onion or cabbage salad (or all three) are included, making a pita sandwich the perfect hand-held meal. The meats can also be ordered as a platter which includes all the sandwich ingredients plus humus, a dip made from pureed chick peas, better known in Miami as garbanzo beans. 

Bean or pea, it's fabulous on a pita.

Lebanese are crazy for Kibeh. It's their national dish. Although other Middle Easterners lay claim to kibeh, Lebanon has bragging rights. Jerusalem Market dishes up this mixture of ground lamb with bulgur wheat and fried or raw onion . 

Every day Elzoor cooks a different special. 

Today might be a lamb and rice stew, tomorrow, a chicken with lemon sauce, or stuffed cabbage with rice and meat, fragrant with mint and garlic. The daily special also comes with side dishes that range from stuffed grape leaves to stewed lentils, lemon spinach and grilled eggplant.

No meal in the Middle East ends without coffee. If Sam offers you a tiny demitasse cup heady with the smell of cardamom, say yes. And try a slice of baklava a dessert made from thin sheets of filo dough, honey and pistachios. 

Another traditional end to a meal is sharing a sheesha, a water pipe filled with flavored tobacco. For now, Sam only sells them but he's planning on adding outside tables where smokers can enjoy a cappuccino, or a strawberry or mixed fruit smoke on a balmy Miami evening. 

In addition to the restaurant, Sam also has several shelves of Middle Eastern groceries: keg-sized cans of pickled turnips, spices from Jordan, and snack bags of the Israeli version of potato chips.

 He also offers belly dancing music and sunglasses. After all, you never know what you might need when you're traveling with the road map to peace.

Headline: "FIU Connection" disrupted in game vs. Heat
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The last time Carlos Arroyo and Raja Bell appeared in a game together as teammates in Miami, it was in 1999, when both played for FIU.

The duo, now playing for the Utah Jazz, made their return to Miami in a 97-85 loss to the Heat Feb. 17 at the American Airlines Arena.

Arroyo, who is having a fabulous year as the Jazz's new starting point guard, struggled, however, getting outscored by Miami's point guard, Dwyane Wade, 31-8. 

Arroyo shot only three for 13 from the field and finished with six assists. 

Bell, who joined Arroyo in Utah prior to this season, played well off the bench, scoring 10 points on five of 12 shooting in 29 minutes.

It was an uncharacteristically poor game for the 6-foot-2-inch Arroyo, who is averaging 13.3 points, 5.1 assists and is shooting more than 46 percent from the field this season. Arroyo had trouble containing Wade, who knocked down eight of 13 field goal attempts and hit another 14 of 17 from the line to lead Miami. 

Bell, who is ranked sixth in the NBA in three-point percentage (42 percent), missed both three pointers he attempted, but added four rebounds and three assists.

"The FIU Connection," as they have been referred to on ESPN's SportsCenter, make up the only two former FIU players in the NBA. They have led the young Jazz, which lost legends John Stockton and Karl Malone during the off season, to a surprising 26-27 record to this point. 

But they just weren't able to deliver a win like they so commonly did when dominating in the Golden Panther Arena.

Headline: Time for FIU students to step up to the plate
Subheadline: Commentary
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The FIU baseball team needs your help.

The Golden Panthers are off to the worst start in school history (1-7), with multiple losses to Hawaii, Central Florida and Florida A&M already in the books. Yes, you heard correctly --- FAMU. 

The same FAMU that FIU beat 15 straight times prior to this year's season-opening disaster that saw the Golden Panthers drop their first two games to the Rattlers. FIU had won 26 of its past 29 games against FAMU, yet somehow managed to lose two of three to them at home on opening weekend.

That performance was followed by a two-game sweep at the hands of UCF, again at home. FIU had beaten the Golden Knights in eight of the previous 11 meetings.

Then came the clincher. 

FIU was swept again, this time in Hawaii. The Rainbows, while not a bad team by any stretch, were 1-5 entering their series vs. FIU before defeating the Golden Panthers three times.

So what does all of this get you if you're FIU?

After a two-game series at FAMU (which FIU cannot afford to lose), the No. 3 ranked Miami Hurricanes visit University Park Thursday. FIU is 20-85 all-time against their cross-town rivals, including two losses in two meetings last season.

FIU's ship is going nowhere right now and a win against the 'Canes would undoubtedly retract the anchor. 

But the team needs home support from its students.

Last year's game at University Park, a 6-4 Miami victory, looked more like a neutral game than a home game. Roughly half the spectators were decked in orange and green attire. 

That is unacceptable. Yes, the FIU baseball stadium was finally semi-full for a change, but is it a good thing when nearly half the crowd is there to root for the opposing team?

The FIU athletic program has taken drastic steps to turn the university into a major player, but it seems as if the student body could care less.

The men's soccer team was ranked as high as fifth in the nation this past season and its games drew similar interest to that of pre-playoffs Marlins games.

The infantile football team took a huge step by declaring I-A status in December. FIU has already reached verbal agreements with NCAA football powers Kansas State and Texas Tech for the 2005 season and has signed a contract to play Alabama in 2006 and 2009. 

Yet, FIU football averaged only 7,073 fans per game last year and must average at least 15,000 over the next two years to maintain Division 1-A status. To achieve this goal, FIU Athletics is planning on hosting Student Appreciation Night at one of the home games this year involving a major musical concert and will soon announce plans to play FAMU in either the Orange Bowl or Pro Player Stadium next season.

But the question still remains: Will people come?

It's time for FIU students to step into the batter's box, starting Thursday against UM and support a program that has been among the NCAA's best over the past 10 years.

A sell-out win vs. the 'Canes is the best way to get the ball rolling.

Headline: Injury-riddled softball team unable to provide offense in loss to FAU
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With its two best starting pitchers out with injuries, FIU was forced to turn to option No. 3, closer Nicole Barrett. 

Barrett pitched well, but had no run support as FIU allowed three runs in the top of the seventh inning in a 3-0 loss to Florida Atlantic University at University Park Feb. 17.

With the game scoreless in the seventh, Barrett allowed a solo leadoff homer to FAU third baseman Jenn Piazza, who drilled the ball over the left field fence, giving the Owls the only run they would need.

"It came down to one pitch, but [Barret] threw a high pitch and [Piazza] hit it out of the park," head coach Kim Gwydir said.

The Owls added two more runs in the inning, one on a Ginny Matthews RBI double, and the other on a fielding error.

FAU's starting pitcher, Candice Freel (5-3), shut down the FIU offense with a complete-game shutout, 11-strikeout performance.

In addition to FIU's scoring problems, the team was just two for 23 at the plate. First baseman Cindy Turek and second baseman Lindsay Tippings were the only Golden Panthers to record hits. 

The first four batters in the lineup (Kristen Perry, Deomni Murray, Turek and Jennifer Owens) were a combined zero for 11.

"We need to score runs. The middle of our order has done it in the past. We have people who have been all-conference hitters and above .300 hitters, but we have not been very lucky lately," Gwydir said.

FIU had one golden chance to score in the second inning with runners on second and third base with no outs, but failed to produce any runs. 

Shortstop Tabitha Embry attempted a squeeze bunt, but Marleah Stapf was thrown out at the plate, ending the threat.

"We bunted, but we didn't score the run. But Freel is an outstanding pitcher," Gwydir said.

The lack of runs for FIU has been common all season, with the team averaging less than three runs per game through nine games.

"The middle of our order just needs to get hot. We're swinging the bat well. We're just hitting the ball right at people," Gwydir said. 

The lacking offensive production wasted a solid outing by Barrett (0-3), who allowed only three hits in 6.1 innings of work. 

FIU, short on pitchers, was forced to use Turek in relief of Barrett in the seventh. Turek allowed one hit and one unearned run.

Gwydir said she plans on using Turek again when the team begins a three-game road trip in Californina, starting with a game vs. Cal-Berkeley Feb. 20.

FIU's top pitcher, Amanda Nealer, who had been out with a respiratory infection, is expected to return to the mound but her innings will be monitored. The teams' other top pitcher, Kendra Laminack, who is out with a leg injury, is not expected back until next week.

Headline: Med school plans roll on, but undergrads remain neglected
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
FIU's plans to erect a medical school are being finalized, but without caution it may not be much of an improvement to the university. The school's hope to "develop local minority talent," is well intentioned and with time, will probably prove to be a successful addition, so long as other programs are not neglected along the way.

Considering the current budget crunch the university is in, the initial expenditure of $30 million on operating costs, plus a facilty, for the medical school seems too much of a stretch. After the recent additions of the football team and the law school, to add a medical school now sounds hasty, not to mention expensive for students.

When the football team was created, the men's soccer team - FIU's most successful sports team to date - was almost cut for lack of funding. The Miami International Film Festival was recently abandoned to cut costs. For a time, faculty hiring was frozen - adjuncts were the only way FIU could afford to get classes taught. Currently, there's construction occurring all over the University Park campus, though with all the supposed advancements, departments are left understaffed and classes for upperclassmen are slim pickings. 

Next year's tuition is expected to rise as high as 12.5 percent based on Gov. Jeb Bush's proposed budget, and with the poor quality of many programs in the school, students and faculty are suffering the meagerness of the university's resources. There are empty faculty positions in several departments, and unless a student's major is business, education or hospitality management, he or she better get used to the conditions or transfer out, because it doesn't seem as if FIU administrators are in a hurry to give money to departments in lower demand.

That's not to say that the medical school is a mistake. The projected benefits for the school and the area, will probably be seen in the long run. But FIU has critical weaknesses now that must be mended because they affect the most lucrative device the school has: students. When the medical school admits its first class, where will most students come from? The lacking science programs. Where will the College of Law draw the most applicants from? The under funded liberal arts departments. 

As FIU tries to become a more respectable, "traditional" university, it must keep it mind that in continuing to neglect its current undergraduate student population, incentives to enroll into its graduate programs will grow smaller with each freshman class.

Headline: Corporations gain big profits for soldiers' sacrifices at war
Author: Ted Randall/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
I recently finished reading Anthony Swafford's self effacing memoir "Jarhead." It is a visceral, unflinching account of the first Gulf War.  

Swafford shares the foul, dehumanizing secrets of war as seen from the trenches. He was a lance corporal and sniper with second battalion, seventh Marines. I was particularly amused with how clairvoyant and cavalier he and his fellow "Devil Dogs" were about why they were in Iraq fighting and dying - oil. 

Swafford and his buddies knew the  scoop.  They called themselves the "Petroleum Battalion" in the "Oil Corps." Officially, they were liberating Kuwait and teaching Saddam a lesson.  But among the troops on the ground doing the killing and dying, they knew the real deal. They were securing resources for private corporations like Halliburton and ExxonMobil.

Former U.S. Marine Smedley Butler, winner of two Medals of Honor who served the Corps for 34 years, wrote "War is a racket ... It always has been.  It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious.  It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives."  

As is true in all wars, there is always a small elite minority grossly profiting from the deaths and sacrifices of the many.  Young men and women, families sacrificing their children for the sake of private interests disguised beneath the banner of democracy and freedom.  

For those who are doing the dying and bleeding, there are no illusions.  The reality of war is fast and hard.  

Butler's and Swafford's insights ring true in today's little Iraqi quagmire, but there is something grossly wrong and disgusting in what is happening in Iraq.  Corporations are getting huge contracts, making massive profits, and evading taxes as U.S. service members risk their lives to protect their assets.

Operation Iraqi Freedom has cost more than 540 combat deaths and as many as 3,500 wounded, not to mention the hundreds medically evacuated for other medical reasons including combat stress. Why have these young Americans died and suffered?  Regime change?  WMDs?  Democracy?  No, Dick Cheney, Halliburton, and Bechtel.

According to an online article by Corpwatch, Dick Cheney's 2001 financial disclosure statement states that Halliburton is paying him a "deferred compensation" of up to $1 million a year following his resignation as chief executive in 2000. 

A Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown and Root secured a 10-year deal known as the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, from the Pentagon. The contract is a "cost-plus-award-fee, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity service," which basically means endless contracts and money for Kellogg, Brown and Root, possibly as much as $830 million.

I guess Halliburton is not going bankrupt anytime soon, so Cheney stands to collect a few more million dollar checks.

Meanwhile, a female soldier is ambushed by a guerilla and loses both legs.

Add to that this outrage, The Nation reports that more than 27,000 military contractors, or about one in nine, are evading taxes (in the billions of dollars) and still continuing to win new government business. 
One company providing dining, security and custodial services to military bases received $3.5 million in payments from the Department of Defense despite owing almost $10 million to the government.  

Think of this.  

The General Office of Accounting estimates that the DOD could have collected $100 million in 2002 by offsetting payments to delinquent companies still on its payroll.  

Meanwhile, another American soldier is blown to pieces.

Butler asked "how many of these war millionaires shoulder a rifle?  How many of them spent sleepless, frightened nights ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets?  How many of them were wounded or killed in battle ... the general public shoulders the bill.  This bill renders a horrible accounting.  Newly placed gravestones, mangled bodies, Shattered minds.  Broken hearts and homes.  Economic instability.  Back-breaking taxation for generations and generations."  

How many folks in congress who gave Bush carte blanche to go to war ever served in the armed forces or have children in the service?  I could count them on one hand.

American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are dying so that private industry can get rich.

Headline: Dump the HEA's drug conviction provision
Author: Admatha Israel/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
For the past year, I have been working on a project aimed at increasing awareness of the consequences of the Higher Education Act of 1998 more specifically, its role in the rising cost of tuition for college students at FIU and across the nation. My goal is to start a chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy on our campus.

In an age of rising college tuition costs, one of the best ways to keep tuition down is to increase enrollment. Simple mathematics tells us it's easier to pay a professor's salary with 40 paying students than with 20. But since the drug provision was added to the Higher Education Act in 1998, more than 128,000 students have been denied aid as a result of their response to the question about drug convictions on the FAFSA.

The HEA drug provision causes more harm than good because it primarily targets lower-income families. Children of the well-to-do need not worry about losing their college opportunities because they can afford the legal representation necessary to avoid drug convictions as well as the price of tuition without aid. Young ex-offenders are likely to be unable to raise tuition money and thereby sent into a downward spiral toward failure.

The HEA drug provision punishes students twice for the same crime. If someone has already paid his debt to society, it doesn't really make sense to preclude him from an education. Students who leave college as a result of having lost their financial aid are discouraged from returning to finish their degrees. Receiving an education reduces the likelihood that an individual will return to engaging in illegal activity, strengthening the point that education is the solution to crimes.

The intention of the HEA is to make it easier, not more difficult, for students to obtain a full education. To limit the number of students eligible for federal aid is counter productive and brings us no closer to solving the nation's drug problems.

Meanwhile, HEA drug provision ignores the major drug problems on college campuses today. Alcohol abuse kills more than 100,000 people every year, however, no one seriously suggests that revoking eligibility for financial aid would be a sensible approach to the alcohol problem.

The HEA already excludes students receiving lower than a "C" average from receiving federal financial aid. The drug provision, therefore, only denies aid to students who are doing well in school.

While psychology and medical science teaches us about the dangers of drug use and drug abuse, political science teaches us that criminalizing popular behavior is counter productive. 

Political science also teaches us that many government programs intuitively designed to help citizens, sometimes don't work; from tobacco and alcohol prohibition to Social Security and welfare programs.

The drug law is unconstitutional, and if subjected to constitutional review, would probably not pass. But very few people truly appreciate the  value of our constitution to protect us from unreasonable government. It infuriates me to see how people can be so callous as to have wanton disregard for their civil rights. 

Many people complain about politicians (even student government representatives), but don't care about politics enough to participate in changing it. 

Where is the sense in that? 

Imagine where the Haitian people would be today on the 200th anniversary of their independence, if Toussaint L'ouverture just complained about French oppression instead of having the vision to fight for freedom? Imagine if Rosa Parks refused to exercise her right to rational autonomy, and sat in the back of the bus (as most of us would have at that time).

Where would we be today, if Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks behaved as we do, supremely indifferent to the struggle of the "wretched of the earth?"

Some people, when presented with an alternative, vehemently resist it, as if their very lives depended on the success (rather, failure) of draconian drug war policies. 

It is time for real change in drug policy, and to get it, it is imperative that we look beyond the obvious or at least take a peek at the intangibles. 

In the end, no matter what is said here, there will be those who fight to keep the rest of society in this conundrum of "retrograde unconstitutionality." 

That's why this message is directed toward those who want change. See your local student government representative and ask them about SSDP. After all, change will come, it's just a matter of time.

Admatha Israel is the representative at large  of the Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council.
