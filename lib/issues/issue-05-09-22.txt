When: Sept. 24 at 7:00 p.m.
Where: Indian Stadium, Jonesboro, Ark.
TV: None
Radio: WKAT 1360 AM, WRGP 88.1 FM 
Record: FIU 0-2, Arkansas State 1-2

On offense:
In their first Sun Belt Conference game, FIU will need to score early and have a more consistent performance from the running game if they want to pull off the win. The Indians' defense will be a tough one as they are coming off a game in which they held heavily favored Oklahoma State to only 20 points. 

On Defense:
The Golden Panthers will need to stop ASU running back Antonio Warren. Warren has rushed for over 100 yards in each of the Indians' first three games. However, if they can contain Warren, they will have to deal with quarterback Nick Noce, who can spread the field. In the 2004 season, Noce passed for 2,115 yards, which is third all-time at ASU.

Headline: Senior scores four goals in victories
Author: Joshua Rey / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team continued to impress, with wins against Alabama A & M and Xavier University at the annual FIU Diadora Classic, Sept. 16-18 at the University Park Soccer Stadium. The Golden Panthers are now 4-1 on the season.

Senior Carron Williams scored four goals, including a hat trick against the Bulldogs, to lead the Golden Panthers.  FIU's defensive trio of Sheldon Jardine, Ainsley Deer and Chris Handy also stood out during the tournament.

"The team played well, but I think overall we could have done better," said Jardine.

FIU may need to do that heading into a difficult California road trip. The Golden Panthers will take a 2-0 road record into their match against No. 13 Santa Clara on Sept. 23 and will visit the University of San Francisco two days later.


FIU 3, Alabama A&M 1

Carron Williams scored with his head and both his feet in FIU's 3-1 victory over the Alabama A&M Bulldogs Sept. 16. Williams' earned the first hat trick of his illustrious FIU career. 

"It feels good; it feels great," Williams said, amid the congratulations of other players. "I've got good teammates who pass me the ball and I finish."

The game was scoreless until the 25th minute, when freshman midfielder Juan Guerra drove the ball along the right side of field and kicked a high-arching cross pass into the box. 

Bumped by a Bulldog defender, Williams still managed to time his dive perfectly and head the ball between a crowd and into the net.

FIU's stellar passing continued in the next minute when defenseman Chris Handy passed to midfielder Lucas Scudeler, who then found forward David Hope in fluid motion open in the box.  Hope gave Williams a perfect lead pass and Carron then tapped it in to make the score 2-0.

"Off of my weak foot, my left foot," Williams said proudly. "When I saw David got the ball and I was free, I was running onto it so he gave me a good ball and I finished it."

It took the bad luck of a teammate for Carron to nail down the hat trick. Hope nearly scored off of a Scudeler pass in the 57th minute, but Bulldog goalkeeper Andrew Jjombwe made a diving save.  

When the ball landed in front of Williams on the rebound, he smashed it with his right foot into the right corner of the net for his 3rd goal of the game.

Nearly unnoticed in Williams big night, FIU defenseman Sheldon Jardine had a tremendous game, consistently cutting off passes and shot attempts. He showed off athletic ability with a fancy scissor kick to intercept one pass deep in FIU territory.

"I went up. I tried to commit myself to the ball," said Jardine. "Once you commit yourself 100 percent, that's how it is."

Alabama A&M midfielder Henry Kabata scored the Bulldogs' lone goal of the game in the 63rd minute.


FIU 3, Xavier 0 

The Golden Panthers outshot Xavier University 28-9 en route to a 3-0 shutout victory over the Musketeers in the final game of the Diadora Classic tournament on Sept. 18.

In the first start of his collegiate career, goalkeeper Kyle Thomas had four saves, including two in the final three minutes to keep Xavier off the scoreboard.

"It felt good. I was a little nervous at the start because I hadn't been on the field in a while," said Thomas, a redshirt freshman. "I've gotta give credit to my defense. They definitely held it up in the shutout."

Carron Williams got FIU on the board in the 22nd minute with his sixth goal of the season.  

After a Xavier foul, Lucas Scudeler quickly took control of the ball and found a wide-open Williams, who softly scooted the ball into the right corner of the net, giving FIU a 1-0 lead.

Only one goal separated the Golden Panthers and Musketeers for the next 55 minutes of play, despite FIU surpassing 20 shots and 10 corner kicks.  

In the 80th minute, junior David Hope baited Xavier goalkeeper Adam Sokolowski out of position before passing off to Scudeler.  Scudeler's shot deflected off a defender and was then kicked in for the goal by reserve forward Danny Vazquez.

"I play good center-mid, but up top I know I can finish," said Vazquez, a sophomore.  "I have that confidence.  I went in and I had a goal on my first touch."

The Golden Panthers capped off the victory on a high note when freshman Levi Coleman scored the first official goal of his career with 11 seconds remaining in the game. After Thomas kicked the ball to Coleman at midfield, Levi did the rest.

"I was so happy Kyle played that," said Coleman, whose shot found the left corner of the net.  "I didn't think he was going to because of the time. But he played it and I appreciate it. I owe him a lot because that was important right there."

Headline: Women's volleyball wins tournament at home
Author: Gabriel Medina / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coach Danijela Tomic and her volleyball team capped off the FIU Marriot Invitational with perfect 3-0 record, Sept. 16-17 at the Pharmed Arena. 

Leading the way was sophomore Anita Szymanska who was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player after recording team-highs in hitting percentage (.351) and blocks (13).

Seniors Laura Vogel and Anna Dmowska were each named to the all-tournament team. For Vogel, it is her fourth all-tournament team in as many events. 

The Golden Panthers improved to 9-5 on the season before entering their Sun-Belt Conference schedule on the road Sept. 23 against Arkansas State. 


FIU 3, Stetson 1

The Golden Panthers began their tournament Sept. 16, with a match against Stetson. 

Szymanska and sophomore Whitney Kenney each reached double-doubles for FIU. Szymanska finished the match with  16 kills and 14 digs. Kenney totaled 56 assists and 19 digs. 

Dmowska led her team with 17 kills. Senior Carolina Cano matched the team's highest dig-total of the season with a career-high 20 digs. 

Sophomore Mariana Drumeva set a career-high of her own with 11 digs during the match.

During game one, FIU did not commit a single attacking error, which paved the way for a 30-15 pounding of Stetson. 

In game two, however, FIU had seven service errors with no aces, while Stetson enjoyed a game two 30-22 win.

FIU returned to form during game three in which they never lost their lead, winning the game 30-25. 

The Golden Panthers, once again, never trailed in game four and closed the first match of the tournament with another 30-25 win.


FIU 3, JU 2

Jacksonville proved to be a steeper hill to climb in FIU's second match on Sept. 16. As both teams took the court, the Golden Panthers had no clue as to how daunting their next opponent would be. 

"Jacksonville was definitely our toughest opponent," Spasojevic said.

FIU came from behind for a 3-2 victory to help the team improve to 4-1 in five-game matches this season.

Dmowska led the Golden Panthers with 20 kills while Szymanska added 19 kills and 11 digs of her own. Kenney totaled her third-consecutive double-double with 44 assists and a personal best 21 digs.

Spasojevic totaled a career-high 17 kills on a match-high .324 hitting to go along with five blocks.

FIU held two match points after taking a 29-27 lead late in game one, but Jacksonville came back to win four consecutive points to win 31-29. 

In game two, the Golden Panthers held on to their lead for a strong 30-21 victory. FIU hit .326 during the game and held Jacksonville to a .073 hitting. Spasojevic led the team with six kills.

Game three was a whole different story as Jacksonville cruised to a 30-16 win over the Golden Panthers. Jacksonville committed only two attack errors. On top of that, the Dolphins hit .267 and took advantage of .000 hitting from FIU's end.

Dmowska carried the team on her back the rest of the way with a victory in game four. 

She led the team with eight kills, which lifted FIU 30-20 over Jacksonville. In game five, she helped push the Golden Panthers to a 15-10 decision over Jacksonville.


FIU 3, UPRM 0

It was smooth sailing for the Golden Panthers on Sept. 17 during the final match of the tournament. 

Although the team trailed in each game, the match was completed with FIU pounding Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, 3-0.

Dmowska led all players with 13 kills and Santisi with 20 digs (a three-game team-season-high).

Game one proved to be the only tight game of the match, as FIU came out on top with a 30-25 victory. At one point, UPRM held a 15-10 lead, but it quickly vanished with a 6-0 FIU run.

Games two and three were won with the help of long runs. FIU went on an 11-0 run behind the serve of Szymanska to go up 21-6, and an eventual 30-18 win in game two.

Then, late in game three, a 7-0 run on Vogel's serve lifted FIU to a 30-19 win to clinch the match.

The championship marked The Golden Panthers' first regular-season title since winning the New Hampshire Tournament on Sept. 20, 2003.

Subheadline: Administration not fulfilling their promise on game room and new restaurants 
Author: Alejandro Almirola / Junion Political Science major
&nbsp;
My complaint with the FIU administration  is that they have been lying to us about opening new restaurants and the game room by the Fall of 2005. 

What happened with that promise and what's their excuse in denying us, the students, our legitimate rights of having a game room to chill out and relax? They have been teasing us for two years about expanding this and expanding that in order to better serve us, as they say. But in reality, it seems that the only people benefiting from this is the administration who keep expanding overvalued offices at the expense of the students who are getting exploited for menial superficial fixes. 

I would appreciate it if the editor took the time to grill the administration in its lapses of promises to the student body that we have patiently put up with. Thanks for your consideration.

Headline: College life concept not limited to only Greek organizations
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"Are you gonna go Greek?" Surely all FIU students get asked this all important question at one point or another. This question was posed to me the first day of my freshman orientation back in 2001 by one of the peer advisors. Now while I chose not to go Greek, I've had the pleasure of knowing plenty of brothers and sisters of our respective Greek organizations. 

They've all expressed a deep level of unity and goals of aiming to help not only their own, but all that could use their support. With Greek members making themselves available to undergrads, I encourage everyone, especially freshmen, to listen to their entreaties with an open mind.

While Greek organizations certainly play significant roles in student life, there is a large misconception that student life is about going Greek. FIU is home to countless non-Greek organizations which offer guidance, entertainment, unity and opportunities to further career ambitions. 

Students have a variety of options in Student Organization Council student organizations - everything from medical, engineering, religious and political organizations, just to name a few.

I stress the benefits of these SOC clubs due to my experiences as a member and president of the FIU College Democrats. Through my affiliation with the group, I had the benefit of meeting elected officials and networking with numerous individuals.

 Among these include President Bill Clinton, Senators Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, John Edwards, Bob Graham, Bill Nelson and many of their aides. These contacts undoubtedly will come in handy once I graduate in December and hit the job market.

Other than making contacts, members traveled to Tallahassee to lobby state leaders, participated in forums, debates and were included on the VIP, Secret Service approved lists for town hall meetings and rallies.

 For members seeking internships and job opportunities, campaigns offered both paid and college credit positions to all those who solicited them.

I write of my personal experiences not to indulge myself or provide the College Democrats with a shameless plug. 

Unfortunately, membership in many non-Greek groups are extremely depressing. Some clubs have had to go under due to a lack of support and funding. 

That's unfortunate because students of all majors can definitely find an organization that could enhance their professional potential. Additionally, connecting with like-minded students and professors provides contacts and references that will last far beyond graduation.

Discover everything FIU has to offer. Contact presidents of organizations that interest you. Make your time at FIU memorable. 

Don't just attend your classes and go home. That's not what the college experience is about. Become involved and allow these student organizations to help you. Many of my best memories of FIU will come from my time with the FIU College Democrats. There's no reason any university club can't do the same for you.

Headline: Patients vs Insurance
Subheadline: Monetary issues a priority with insurance companies
Author: Ben Badger / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There are a lot of strange things in this country; strange because they are evil. The most bizarre is the health care system of this country.

 Doctors are no longer the ones treating the patients, but rather the insurance companies. 

Two years ago, my doctor prescribed a glucose watch to monitor my blood sugar levels that were out of control and causing me severe harm (I am diabetic). 

This glucose watch was not a luxury item or anything of that nature, yet my insurance denied the watch, claiming that it was not medically required and basically a waste of money. 

The three times I had seizures in the middle of the night begged to differ. And the cost of all the fire rescue visits far outweighed the cost of the watch.  And it does not stop there. 

My mother was recently told by a small clinic where she had her most recent mammogram that she had stage four breast cancer. My mother was horrified, but when she went to see a surgeon, he said he did not see anything more than what appeared to be a cist. 

My mother pleaded to be sent to the Baptist Hospital Outpatient Center for another mammogram.

 She had been going to this hospital for years for this procedure, but her physician told her our insurance company said that by no means was anyone to be sent there for any reason. 

Patients were only to go to the clinic in which the insurance company had a contract and discount with. 

After a month of arguments, my mother was finally allowed to go to the Mercy Hospital Outpatient Center for her mammogram. 

The test concluded that she had a cist and nothing more, but my mother's surgeon, now having seen two completely different reports, would like her to have another mammogram in three months just to be sure.

 So now the insurance has paid for not one, not two, but three mammograms, not to mention various appointments with the surgeon because they refused to pay for her initial request to be treated at Baptist Hospital.   

Insurance companies do not care about patients. They care about only one thing: profits. Every day insurance companies override doctors and deny patients what they need. 

The usual justification they use is that doctors are just prescribing needless medications, procedures and devices so that the insurance companies will pay the bill. 

While this may be true in some cases, there are others where their method of thinking is simply incorrect. 

The problem is that they have no compassion for the patient. All they see is the green, but what gets me is that by constantly cutting corners, they only cause more expenses, especially ones that could have been avoided from the get go. 

It seems to me as if insurance companies are the ones driving up costs with unnecessary procedures and not the doctors. 

Apparently, it's survival of the fittest - the strong survive and the weak die. I thought that mentality died out some time ago. Guess I was wrong. 

I watched a movie called "Damaged Care" a while ago. What I saw horrified me. Dr. Linda Peeno was the main focus of the film. 

It detailed her climb into the heart of the managed health care industry and her subsequent crusade to inform people what's really going on, namely, the completely unethical business practices of the managed health care industry. 

 Once, she was pressured into denying a man a heart transplant. The man was literally on the operating table waiting for clearance from the insurance company. 

He died shortly after Peeno denied the procedure. She was congratulated by Humana (the company she was working for at the time) for saving the company a half million dollars, only to find out shortly later that the company bought a statue for $500,000. 

In this case, Humana cared more about a statue than a man's life. 

I would like to think that this was an exaggeration of the truth and what insurance companies do. In reality, this happens every single day. It disgusts me that this kind of thing can happen in the United States. 

I think Peeno says it best, "I continue to be surprised by what is done to unsuspecting patients by the unregulated health care industry," she said. 

Only when there is a comprehensive yet fundamental change in health care will we witness unconscionable acts against patients be prevented.

 We can only hope that some day we can revert back to decency and begin to care for people the way I know we can.

Headline: Intramural field delays continue
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
Intramural sports provide an opportunity for campus recreation, however, ever since one of two intramural fields was taken away to contruct the Red parking garage, intramural sports has been crowed and in need of a new field. 

A new intramural field is in the planning stages of construction - in which it has been for the past two years. 

"My main goal is to get everything solidified this year before I leave, hopefully this semester. It's been two years that we've been talking back and forth about it, students are waiting for it, and it's being pushed off with so much construction on campus," said Alex Prado, president of Student Government Association.

It was decided by the Board of Trustees that 21 percent of the raised parking fee was to go towards the construction of the new intramural field. 

"It needs to happen because student fees being raised and parking fees being raised, is something that we compromised for and we haven't gotten our part of the compromise," Prado said.

The construction process for the intramural field has been delayed for several reasons. 

Deciding what kind of grass the field should have, whether the field is to have a track for university athletes and maintaining the budget under a million dollars, have all been factors of the construction delay. 

"We have to keep it under a million dollars. If the project goes up, the money that we have invested with the company that already did the work goes to waste because they would have to do it all over again," Prado said.

Several ideas as to what kind of grass they should use for the field was discussed - options being grass like the prior field or a fake turf. 

The decision was to use the fake turf surface because in the long term, maintenance would be cheaper and a track around the field is going to be built once the field is complete. 

"We agreed on the field with artificial grass, and I'm going to help Athletics get their track," Prado said.

The latest meeting with the contractors, Sept. 8, discussed whether or not the track will be included as part of the project or if the track would be implemented after the field is constructed. Figures for the cost of the track platform are to be discussed during the next meeting, Sept. 29. 

Two years ago, intramural sports had two intramural fields. Now, intramural sports use the soccer field and the residential quad for practice. 

Under Clayton Solomon's term as Student Government President, March 4, 2004, the Board of Trustees approved the construction of a new intramural field. 

Before the approval from the Board of Trustees, research for location and funding was done, as were meetings with Telles-Irvin former executive vice president of Student Affairs and Human Resources, Paul Gallagher, former executive vice president of Business and Finance, Robert Griffith, Director of Facilities Planning and the Parking and Traffic department.

Headline: Red Cross serves evacuees
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
As Tropical Storm Rita was announced as a threat to the Florida Keys, residents from Monroe County picked up their belongs and evacuated to FIU, their nearest hurricane shelter.

FIU sent out a university-wide e-mail Sept. 19 at 12:41 p.m. to let students, faculty and staff know that classes in Primera Casa were being relocated to other university buildings. The university closed at 3 p.m. and continued to be closed on Sept. 20. At approximately 3:30 p.m., the traffic leaving campus looked like rush hour traffic. About 30 minutes later, the campus looked deserted. 

"I knew it was gonna be bad before I got there, because I knew everybody was leaving at three. It took me about 35 minutes to get out of campus. People were a little aggressive, typical Miami driving like always," said senior, Gianni Milanese.

This is the second time this hurricane season that FIU has opened its doors for Monroe County residents to be situated in the PC shelter.

"There is a lot of community spirit here, people are talking about their friends and neighbors evacuating from the Keys, from those coming in by bus with find a reunion [of neighbors]," said Sam Yates, public information officer for the Red Cross.

The Pharmed Arena opened at 10 a.m. to receive the first evacuees and later they were transferred to PC. On the second floor of PC, nurses and doctors were readily available to care of people with special needs. The third and fourth floors were open to the general public. Floors were divided into family, individual, female and male only areas.

There is no definite count of the amount of persons PC can occupy but on average, 20 square feet per person is reserved for the general public and 40 square feet for people with special needs. The ratio changes depending on whether or not PC is holding evacuees before and after the event. 

About 300 people are usually expected every time the PC shelter opens for Monroe residents, however, due to recent Hurricane Katrina, more people were expected to evacuate.

"We probably will have three to four hundred people coming in, but because of Hurricane Katrina being in the spotlight, we could have more. We are prepared to handle up to 1,200 people here," Yates said.

The Red Cross provides food, snacks, water and housing for the shelter - all free of cost to Monroe residents.  

"We are providing the basic necessities for those who have evacuated from Monroe County," Yates said. "The shelter will remain open as long as there is a need to provide services for the evacuees."

Oil prices rise again

Crude-oil futures surged more than $4 - the biggest one-day price jump ever - as Tropical Storm Rita headed toward a possible hit of U.S. oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico later this week, striking another blow at an industry struggling to recover from Hurricane Katrina.

Sweet crude for October delivery rose $4.39, or 7 percent, to settle at $67.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Nymex crude - still more than $3 off its all-time high of $70.85 - hit briefly on Aug. 30 after Katrina hit the Gulf - had fallen $1.75 on Friday to its lowest closing price since Aug. 5.

Heating oil surged more than 20 cents to $2.0384 a gallon, while gasoline rose nearly 26 cents to $2.0427 a gallon.

"The main driver today is Tropical Storm Rita. We really can't afford to lose more production," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.

Katrina donations pass $1 Billion mark

In the three weeks since Hurricane Katrina and its floods created watery havoc in U.S. Gulf states, Americans have donated just over $1 billion to charities aiding families displaced by the disaster.

This pace of giving exceeds the rate in the two weeks following the Sept. 11 attacks on America, and in the 2 1/2 weeks after 2004's massive tsunami.

Contributions surged after events such as the call by President Bush last week for Americans to support the relief efforts, as well as numerous televised events featuring musicians and celebrities, according to those involved.

The bulk of donations are going to the American Red Cross, which as of midday Sept. 19 had collected $762.5 million, while the Salvation Army garnered $85.7 million, according to Palmer. An initiative started by former U.S. Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton has attracted $100 million in donations, officials said.

Among the celebrities to offer individual donations, actor George Clooney has given $1 million to the United Way Hurricane Katrina Response Fund, courtroom thriller writer John Grisham has given $5 million to a relief fund he and his wife set up to aid Mississippi residents, and hip-hop star Jay-Z has given $1 million to the Red Cross.

So far, the largest corporate donation has come from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the retail giant,  has given $15 million to the Bush-Clinton effort. The Walton family, which owns a majority of the retailer, donated another $15 million.

O'Connor prepares for final days on court

Her legacy not yet sealed, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is getting an unexpected final chance to select cases for the Supreme Court to take on and to influence colleagues in abortion, capital punishment and assisted suicide cases.

O'Connor and her colleagues had thought the term would begin Oct. 3 without her.

At President Bush's request, she postponed her departure following the death this month of her longtime friend and former law school classmate, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.

Her temporary status may lead to some 4-4 votes, delaying decisions in those cases.

The 75-year-old is expected to sit on the bench for the opening week, which includes arguments on assisted suicide and the rights of disabled school children. She appears prepared to stay awhile, rehiring a previous law clerk. She will have four young attorneys to help with the load.

Headline: Draft remains hot topic among potential draftees
Author: Tom Davis / The Record
&nbsp;
Andrew Darata wants to graduate from college, not go to war.

Someday, however, the Bergen Community College freshman believes he will have no choice.

President Bush says there will be no military draft. But Darata believes Eminem, the rapper, when he says that Bush is "lying to us."

"When you're talking about a military draft, a lot of people listen to what others have to say," said Darata, 18.

More than 1,800 American soldiers have died in Iraq. Recruiting numbers are sagging. National Guard troops serving in the Middle East and in hurricane-ravaged areas are stretched thin.

For those who are draft-age, the question has emerged: Will they have to trade their T-shirts and baggy jeans for desert camouflage-fatigues and machine guns?

As classes begin across the nation, a number of men and women are preparing themselves for that possibility.

Even those who doubt it say anything's possible. Another Sept. 11 _ or another Hurricane Katrina _ could change everything, they say.

"My mom is fearing it. She is always fearing that something can happen," said Dan Librero, 22, a Bergen Community College sophomore. "My dad says, `If it happens, I'll help you get out of it.'"

Many believe it would be wrong to reinstate the draft for the first time in 32 years. An Associated Press poll in June said 70 percent of Americans oppose bringing it back.

Lt. Col. Ellen Krenke, a Pentagon spokeswoman, noted that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld opposes the draft. The all-volunteer military does the job better, she said.

"They put their lives on the line in the name of freedom," she said.

Jonathan Kazemaini, 19, said troops who are forced to fight wouldn't work as hard as those who volunteer.

"I trust the president," said Kazemaini, a Bergen Community College sophomore.

U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel introduced a bill in Congress two years ago to reinstate the military draft, saying fighting forces should more closely reflect the economic makeup of the nation.

Minorities make up more than 30 percent of the military, Rangel said. Many of the poor are enticed by promises of employment and free college tuition, he noted.

On its Web site, however, the Selective Service System prints a disclaimer that says the House of Representatives, by a 402-2 vote, defeated the bill. Opposition to the draft is nearly complete, the site says.

Others, however, say rumors spread by Internet bloggers that a military draft is imminent are justified.

Edward Rhodes, an associate professor of political science at Rutgers, said the president has a "credibility gap" with his draft-age students. He said the Bush administration misunderstood the political climate in Iraq.

If there were a national emergency, the Bush administration could expand the active-duty military, Rhodes said. But the additional salaries would be too expensive, he added.

"They (students) can do the math," Rhodes said. "They (the administration) can't keep doing this forever."

Some parents say the political atmosphere reminds them of the Vietnam War, and the false beliefs that the conflict would soon be over.

Some recently formed a non-profit, national organization called Mothers Against the Draft, saying they don't believe the government's denials. Facing war and natural disasters, Congress has few choices, they say.

Dixie Lee Patterson, who heads the organization's New Jersey chapter, said she believes the federal government is "greasing the skids" for bringing back the draft.

"The TV media is bringing up the subject with spaced regularity, always speaking of the eventual necessity of a draft," Patterson said. "So the government propaganda machine is alive and well."

Women are thinking about it, too.

Men ages 18 through 25 still must be registered with the Selective Service, and more than 15 million currently are eligible to be drafted. Women are not required to register.

But Katie Miglia, 19, of Hillsborough, noted that women are now serving in a number of combat-oriented positions in the military. If there were a national emergency, the military may need the additional resources, she said.

"It's scary. Women have never been in that position," said Miglia, a Rutgers sophomore. "I don't have the heart to step on a bug."

Those who are draft-age are even considering what they would do if they were called to duty. College students don't want their lives disrupted.

"It would be like a culture shock. It's not something we're used to," said Eric Barone, 19, of River Edge, a Ramapo College student.

Some say they'd find a way out _ even if it means fleeing to Canada. Others oppose the Iraq war but say they'll serve if called.

James Williams, 19, of Newark, said his registration card came a week before his 18th birthday. He wants to be a federal agent, but he doesn't want to go to war.

"My mom said, `You've got a present,'" said Williams, a sophomore at Fairleigh Dickinson University. "I thought about not filling it out."

"But my mom said, `You'd better.'"

Headline: Health center gains student interest
Author: Flavia Paes Leme / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Many students who showed up at the Health Center's Annual Open House at the Biscayne Bay Campus on Sept. 14, were surprised by the amount of expert services they had been missing.

"Many people think the Health Center just offers first aid. We want to let students know that we're a full primary health clinic with doctors and RNs", said senior nurse practitioner Sara Baker.

From 11 a.m. until 2 p.m., preventive services and health screenings were offered at the clinic free of charge. Health exams included: Spinal analysis, eye exam, cholesterol and blood sugar screenings, skin care, massages, nutritional counseling and tips to prevent computer fatigue.

In addition, staff members handed out brochures and answered questions on services routinely offered at the center. 

Students  were impressed.

"It was really informative. They have a lot of services I didn't know about. Their birth control is much cheaper than at Planned Parenthood, where most students go. I'll be coming here," said senior    Primerose Thompson.

Other students, like Linnette Alvarado, were especially satisfied with their visit to the chiropractor.

"The spinal exam was very informative. They tell you if your hips are aligned or if your posture is off balance. It's good to be aware," said freshman Alvarado.

Junior Carlos Chacon was just glad to find out sooner about his back problem, even though he went to the event with no intention of getting it checked out.

"I came for the free massage but I ended up going through the spinal analysis. I found out my column isn't aligned, so I made an appointment," he said.

Elvira Velez, director of the Health Center, said that every year, for about 10 years, nurse practitioners come up with a new service to offer. 

This year, the novelty was ergonomic tips for computer fatigue, where students learn the proper way to sit and type in order to avoid body pain.

"Feedback is very important to us, that's why we ask students to fill out a survey about the services we offer. One year we tried podiatry, but nobody wanted [his or her] feet examined. I was the only one," she said.

Those who had been to the event in previous years saw improvement.

The only problem remains the lack of space in the building for the 200 people who show up every year to move around.

"Every year [Open House] gets better. They should just have more space," said Leo Caraballas, a member of the maintenance staff.

Velez agreed.

"We need a larger building and we need students' support for that. They have more influence. That's how we originally got this building," she said.

When examinations were done and surveys were completed, participants left with bags full of giveaways, including over-the-counter medicine, nutrition supplements and condoms, among others.

Many students, like senior Carolina Rios, left the event hoping it would repeat itself more than just annually.

"More people should come, and the Health Center should do it more often," said Rios, who is majoring in advertising. For more info, please call the BBC Health Center at (305) 919-5620.

Headline: Our Lady Peace falls short
Author: Michelle Santisteban
&nbsp;
After the first song, "Angels/Losing/Sleep," plays, it almost seems like Our Lady Peace's Healthy In Paranoid Times might actually be good. And it is - for another couple tracks. After "Where Are You," the fourth track on the CD,  it is down hill from there. 

Healthy in Paranoid Times begins nicely - "Angels/Losing/Sleep" is a catchy, complex song with great lyrics and even greater guitar riffs. After the first track, the CD goes into "Will The Future Blame Us," another catchy, melody driven song. At this point the CD looks promising, filled with awesome lines and good riffs, in that sense, Our Lady Peace doesn't disappoint. The rest of the record is well made, and it is obvious that a lot of time went into the making of it. 

The problem is that there is little distinction between each song. It doesn't matter if one song starts off soft and melodic, like "Picture." By the chorus, it will be just like every other song - hard rock and swinging. Still, other songs seem to be under developed and bland like "Apology." What is supposed to come off as sad, comes off as half-baked. Out of 12 songs on Healthy in Paranoid Times, only four are really worth listening to. 

The emotion in these songs is not lost entirely. If you listen closely to the lyrics you get a feel for the tone of the record. It is just hard to keep your attention on one song after another if they all sound the same. The album had the potential to be great, but all the great lyrics were lost on the limp-sound second half of the record. It's like they gave up after writing the four best tracks on the record, then slacked off on the rest of the music. 

As a band, Our Lady Peace is a notch above the rest. Lead singer Raine Maida's voice is distinct, but not in a way that turns listeners off. It is soothing, but has the same potential to convey anger. The rest of the band is so good; they can pull off complex chords and riffs that many bands don't even try for fear of sounding bad. It is a shame that such musicians produced a CD that doesn't truly showcase their talent. 

In their first major hit, "Superman's Dead," Our Lady Peace said, "Ordinary's just not good enough today." Maybe they should take their own advice, because that is exactly what Healthy in Paranoid Times is.

Headline: M.I.A. gets down with Miami at Downtown's I/O Lounge
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
As the crowd at Downtown Miami's I/O Lounge became restless, a bouncer appeared to distribute fans to the already heated audience. 

Just when M.I.A. fanatics thought the show would never start, the Sri-Lankan princess took center stage for an unforgettable performance. 

Even though not many understand most of the lyrics in her songs, due to her thick British accent, M.I.A.'s songs showcase a beat so powerful that even the most depressed rockers at the concert were noticed shaking it when they thought no one was looking. 

Tickets for the Sept. 18 concert were $20 at the door and $15 if bought beforehand. 

Before and after the show, DJs were at hand to lend their music in the two party rooms - just in case audiences were not done partying it up after M.I.A.'s performance. 

M.I.A. performed most of the songs from her debut album, Arular, but always asked which songs the audience wanted to hear. There seemed to be no specific order to the songs, since M.I.A. sometimes forgot which songs she hadn't sang. 

M.I.A.'s outfit and that of her back-up singer were nothing out of the ordinary. 

She kept things original by wearing an over-sized T-shirt and a pair of shorts, keeping true to the fashion sense seen in almost all her videos - nothing extravagant. 

The best song of the night was without a doubt "Bucky Done Gone." In the video for the song, M.I.A. sings alongside a whole brass section. During this performance, though, a single trombone player took the stage and tried his best to follow up with what fans were used to in the video. 

Common sense proved that a solitary brass player does not have the sufficient chops to sound like a full section, but the song saved itself with its extraordinary rhythmic style and M.I.A.'s undeniable lyrical precision. 

The concert itself was pretty short, but M.I.A. hasn't released that many songs, and her album is only 12 tracks long, so it was understandable why the concert was brief. But even then, M.I.A. threw in a song which she co-sung with Missy Elliott in her sixth album The Cookbook. 

The song, titled "Bad Man," was the second song performed and seemed to pump up the audience. 

Though most went to the show to hear M.I.A. and to attend one of the many concerts I/O Lounge holds throughout the year, the show held a political message which many didn't seem to notice. 

Before M.I.A. re-appeared for her encore, in which she performed her yet-to-be released single "Bingo," Kanye West's message of  "George Bush hates black people" was played on loop. 

The audience found it to be an amusing moment, but those who have followed M.I.A.'s road to stardom know the kind of message she wanted to unveil. 

M.I.A. has walked on a very political path. She lived in Sri Lanka during her youth and lived through one of its civil wars. 

After she lost contact with her separatist father for quite some time, she and her family relocated to London, in order to avoid some of the political issues in their homeland. 

She became a photographer for the British band Elastica, and this is how she gained connections into the musical world. She then met Showbiz Records producers Steve Mackey and Ross Orton and they began working on her debut single, "Galang." And the rest is history. 

M.I.A.'s show was, in fact, short lived but she gave it her all and interacted with the audience the best she could. 

The stage she performed on was not the biggest of stages, and the sound system was less than magnificent, but with the resources given, M.I.A. did give a remarkable performance that definitely gave Miami locals a new name to mention to their friends.

Headline: FALL MOVIE PREVIEW
Subheadline: Wide range of movies make their way to a theater near you
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
The summer season has come and gone, and with it the big-name, action-packed movies known to crowd the months between May and September. For movie-lovers tired of plotless films soaked in special effects, fall usually becomes a sort of paradise as studios release films they hope will be able to contend for highbrow awards, beginning with last week's Toronto Film Festival and ending in March with the Oscar race. 

The Beacon has compiled a list of eager movies for this season, including selections from such genres as horror and musicals, knowing that this is the time where it'll be easier to find a flick to please every taste. 


"Everything is Illuminated"

Elijah Wood dons unusually thick glasses for this film as he portrays a Jewish-American man obsessed with finding the woman who saved his grandfather's life during World War II. Liv Schreiber (last seen as a brainwashed villain in "The Manchurian Candidate") directs the movie, which is based on the best-selling novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. The book itself already holds a wide, international fan-base, and with its strange cast of characters and plot twists, the movie may prove to be successful as well. (Sept. 16) 


"A History of Violence"

Master of thrills David Cronenberg directs this film about a happy, small-town diner owner (Vigo Mortensen) who runs into trouble after the media uncovers him thwarting an attempted robbery which leads to his pursuit by a group of mobsters (William Hurt and Ed Harris). Already a favorite at many international film festivals, the movie follows the dark tones set in the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke upon which it is based, probing the nature of violence and why it is that people kill. (Sept. 23) 


"Saw II"

The first "Saw" has gone down in history as being one of the most successful, low-budget horror movies ever produced. This time, director Darren Lynn Bousman returns with a larger budget, promising more gore and mayhem as  detective (Donnie Wahlberg) searches through dismembered corpses for clues that may lead him to Jigsaw, the elusive, 'unseen' killer introduced in the first movie. This sequel will probably prove to be this Halloween's must-see film. (Oct. 28) 


"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"

Teen wizard Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) attends another year at Hogwarts and must face three great challenges: his involvement in the dangerous Tri-Wizard Cup, the return of evil Lord Voldemort (finally portrayed on-screen by Ralph Fiennes) and a sudden surge of hormones as he begins to see that girls can be more than just friends. 

Trailers for this fourth installment of the blockbuster series display breath-taking special effects and cinematography, and most of the cast from the last sequel return. British director Mike Newell may soon be credited for making the best movie of the lot so far. (Nov. 18)


"Walk the Line"

Oscar buzz has already begun to surround this film about legendary country star and rebel Johnny Cash, portrayed by a gruff-voiced Joaquin Phoenix who did the singing for the movie himself. The story follows Cash's rise to fame from his early years as a sharecropper's son to his ground-breaking Folsom Prison Blues concert. 

Along the way, the tortured singer must deal with a growing drug addiction as he courts the woman who will become the love of his life, fellow country star June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Last year's major biopic, "Ray," did big at most film awards, so there is a chance that "Walk the Line" may follow that same example. (Nov. 18) 


"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"

This classic children's tale (based on the first of the seven-part series by C.S. Lewis) is finally brought to the big screen through the collaborations of Disney and family-friendly Walden Media. 

The story centers around four children who, after playing in a large country house they are staying in to avoid the London air raids, discover a wardrobe that serves as a portal to the magical land of Narnia. Once there, the siblings must find a way to destroy the wicked power of the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) who has held the entire country under a winter spell for a hundred years. Andrew Adamson of "Shrek" and "Shrek 2" fame directs (his first live-action endeavor) while Liam Neeson provides a brooding voice to Aslan, the messianic lion whose life or death will ultimately decide the fate of Narnia. (Dec. 9) 


"King Kong"

Director Peter Jackson follows his success with the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy by remaking the classic 1933 film about the love between a woman and an ape - a big ape. Naomi Watts takes over the role made famous by the late Fey Wray as an actress during the Great Depression who follows a deranged director (Jack Black) to film in an obscure Pacific island. However, an adventurer (Adrien Brody) must save the screen beauty after she is kidnapped by the legendary giant gorilla, King Kong, and dragged across ancient jungles, mountains and eventually, New York. Jackson has always admitted that the original "King Kong" is the movie that inspired him to become a director, so this film may very well be another labor of love for him. It's up to audiences to decide if they too will share in that love, though, being that the last "King Kong" 
remake back in the 80s was a major flop. (Dec. 16) 


"The Producers"

This adaptation of the hit Mel Brooks musical (which was itself an adaptation of a movie about a musical he had done in 1968) could turn out to be the best comedy of the season. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their stage roles as a bankrupt producer and his paranoid accountant who decide to make a flop in order to collect the insurance. The result - A manic play written by Nazi sympathizer (Will Ferrell) entitled "Springtime for Hitler" which ends up being an enormous hit. With its moments of low-brow comedy, campy music and all-star cast, this film may be more fun to watch then fall's other major musical, the moody and whiny "Rent." (Dec. 21) 


"Munich"

This year's second Steven Spielberg movie (after "War of the Worlds") has been one of the most secretive projects the famed director has ever worked on. Though many plot points still have not been revealed, it is known that the movie will depict the 1972 murders of 11 Israeli Olympic competitors in Munich by Palestinian terrorists and the vengeful hunt taken by Mossad to find the culprits. Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana are attached to the project, though their characters have still not been announced. Audiences may go see the movie because of its serious, historical content matter, though its tight-lip publicity campaign could also become a box-office draw. (Dec. 23)

Headline: online classes @ FIU
Subheadline:  
Author: cugal001@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
The other day while browsing through the beacon there was an interesting article about the classes that are being offered at FIU that are fully online.  I thought this was greaat because I did more than half of my AA degree online and appreciate the flexible opportunities this alternative way of learning is.  However, I was totally surprised that they are charging an extra fee for these classes.  I can't believe that FIU being a public institution "Miami's first public research univeristy", hasn't researched that some of their competitors don't charge fees or if they do there extremely minimal for the online courses.  I came to FIU with the understanding that this is one of the best institutes for learning.  My mother went here a few years ago.  Back then it was smaller, though parking was still a mission the school did try to accomodate for students.  Now it seems that the school just wants to accomodate financially and for recognition purposes.  With the price of gas going up and tuition on the constant rise why would you charge more for an online course? It's mind-boggling how it can be more costly for a university to pay a professor to sit in a room or cubicle to review students work online versus having them in an actual classroom, with a/c, overhead projectors running, computers & lights on, maintainence, parking...??? I may not be a Math genius but the numbers don't add up.  What exactly is the purpose for these fees again?
