Subheadline: Shafer becomes 16th Golden Panther to score 1,000 points 
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It was a record-setting night for the Golden Panthers and Mandy Shafer.
Behind a game-high 27 points from the senior guard, FIU (18-9, 9-5 Sun Belt) easily defeated Sun Belt Conference rival Arkansas Little-Rock 96-44 on Saturday night at Golden Panther Arena. 

Shafer became the 16th Golden Panther  to surpass the 1,000 career point mark with her performance.  The Eustis, FL native also connected on five three-pointers giving her 60 for the year-a new FIU record. 
Additionally, Shafer stole the ball six times for another career best.

"It's a nice way to leave," said Shafer, who is currently 15th all-time in scoring at FIU with 1,004 points.  "It couldn't have come on a better night.  It was pretty special to accomplish this in our gym and in front of my family."

The game was also the final home contest for four FIU seniors all of which reached double figures.  Shafer, Cormisha Cotton, Anita Heller and Silvia Mesa each competed in their final home game of their collegiate careers.

The 52-point margin of victory was the largest for FIU in a conference matchup since joining the Sun Belt in the 1998-99 season.  

Defensively, FIU recorded season-high's with 12 blocked shots and 15 steals while also protecting the ball offensively knotting a season-low seven turnovers.

Heller scored a career-high 21 points and Cotton blocked six shots to tie her career-high and FIU's single-game record.

The Golden Panthers  connected on eight of their first 12 shots. UALR (5-22, 0-14) hung tough with FIU  in the early going. The teams were tied at 16 with 7:10 left in the first half before the Golden Panthers went on a 31-7 run to close out the half.

Mesa scored 10 points while Cotton added 12 and a game-high 10 rebounds for the 23rd double-double in her career.

UALR was led by Eplunus Brooks' 15 points and nine rebounds.
Next up FIU will be defending their Sun Belt Conference crown from a year ago at the Aeropostale Sun Belt Conference Tournament, March 6-11, in Bowling Green, Ky.  

FIU will face the sixth-seeded Ragin' Cajuns of Louisiana-Lafayette (8-18, 4-11 SBC) in the play-in round on Thursday at 9:00 p.m. EST. 
The Golden Panthers will be the third seed in the bracket.

Last season, FIU won the conference tournament and advanced to the NCAA field of 64. The Golden Panthers defeated Creighton 73-58 before falling to Penn State 96-79 at State College, PN.

FIU was on a thirteen-game winning streak and had not lost a contest in nearly two months before losing to the Nittany Lions.The Golden Panthers closed out the season at 27-6, 13-1 in the SBC.

Headline: In Our View: University should focus on long-term solutions to recurring problems
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
 The dance studios in W-6 are in terrible condition.  As a result, dance majors have been forced to move to off-campus facilities, across the street at the Roxy Performing Arts Center, to attend class.

The old maintenance shed-turned classroom, despite its location on a flood zone and damaged roof, is undergoing "repairs."

But students and faculty don't think repairs can compensate for the inadequate facilities, far behind those of other local programs, both public and private.  

While faculty feel it would be more economical and effective to simply build new facilities, the faculty know that without access to funds, it is not a likely solution.

So the program will have to make due with its aging and inadequate facilities.

Meanwhile, at the Biscayne Bay Campus, the smell that permeates through the North Miami Beach campus' 200 acres has given rise to several urban legends.

Administrators point to several factors to explain the smell, including a water treatment plant and the campus' mangrove preserve. They also point to an acid tank outside Academic II, which disposes of  chemicals employed in photo processing.

That tank has since been "sealed" with a wood plank and caulk while the university searches for a contractor able to construct a concrete cover.

But the temporary-fix wood and caulk cover has done little to alleviate the odor.

So students must put up with the "rotten egg" smell that emanates from the tank.

That seems the trend at FIU: using quick fix solutions which are rarely quick and rarely solutions. The university should try to refocus its efforts. Maybe instead of remodeling the Graham Center, those funds should be diverted to solving more pressing issues.

Headline: What's in a name? A lot of money
Author: Vanessa Lopez/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
In a 1983 article, The Oklahoman newspaper had this to say about FIU: "Until the last five minutes of the game, Oklahoma State struggled Wednesday night at home against a team that sounds like an airport." 

Decades later in 2003, I find myself wondering whether FIU's name-recognition has improved. 

For one thing, FIU itself has changed. We seem to grow bigger every year, and since this article was published we have acquired a law school, a school of architecture and a football team just to name a few. 

Despite these accomplishments, have we received the recognition we deserve? We have garnered some, but the fact remains that even in our own city we are often tossed aside as the "lesser" school, perpetually in the shadow of our cross-town rivals the University of Miami (located in Coral Gables, not Miami, interestingly enough).

I have heard citizens of our fair city compare FIU to a two-year community college. I have heard many argue that FIU is not a state school like University of Florida or Florida State Uuniversity. 

I have even heard students shrug off FIU's accomplishments with the phrase, "Who cares? It's just FIU." 

And therein lies our biggest problem: Our name doesn't take advantage of Miami's national recognition and gives no indication as to where FIU is located other than it's somewhere in Florida. 

Men's soccer coach Karl Kremser, whose team, despite being one of our best, faced a possible cut this year, voiced similar concerns. 

"The name itself is very ambiguous," Kresmer said, "I understand the connotation of it. We are an international university, there's no doubt about it, but [FIU] does not give you any identity in terms of where you are geographically."  

Let's face it: Whether we want to admit it or not, FIU does recognize that its name has shortcomings. 

Consider our letterhead: Florida International University, Miami's Public Research University. If our name spoke for itself, why would need a subheading in our own letterhead explaining who and what we are? 

The fact is, we should not. We should have a name that by itself establishes us as a large state school in Miami, like University of Florida at Miami or Miami State. 

Most would argue that Miami State is a bad choice because Miami is a city, and not a state. But consider other schools that use a similar name construction such as San Jose State, San Diego State, Troy State, Memphis State, Columbus State, and Wichita State. 

The city-state combination is in fact very common in schools across the United States.

"I think Miami State has a catch to it," Everton Edwards, women's soccer, coach said. "You'd know exactly where it is and the fact that it's a state university." 

At any rate, I'm sure students around the nation and the world would recognize Miami before FIU. 

In many cases they recognize UM before FIU - a bit odd considering that with approximately 34,000 students, we are Miami-Dade County's largest university. 

Of course, FIU did in fact consider changing its name to University of Florida at Miami years ago. 

For one reason or another, this did not go through. 

We have changed and grown a great deal since that initial attempt and we by no means should stop trying. 

For example, it took the University of Louisiana-Lafayette decades to get its name changed. 

The university continued its fight, simply because they knew how a name change would increase their recognition. 

In fact, many opponents to the name-change were against it simply because they knew it would detract from Louisiana State, much in the same way a name change for FIU would detract from our rivals whether it's UM or UF. 

Louisiana-Lafayette is not the only school to recognize how changing its name would impact its recognition. 

Ohio State was once Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. 

Cal State Los Angeles was once Los Angeles State. University of North Carolina-Charlotte was once Charlotte College. 

Believe it or not UCLA was once "The Southern Branch of the University of California." 

As far as athletics is concerned, I have heard the argument that all we need do is win to gain recognition. 

But wait a minute, doesn't FIU already have winning teams? 

We have several in fact: women's basketball, baseball and soccer to name a few. 

Despite this, I attended a women's basketball game (which we won, by the way) where there were more Arkansas-Little Rock fans than FIU. 

So if winning games, having a competitive curriculum and well-respected faculty has not worked, what will? What will make us more than "just FIU"? 

We would be better served if we shed our meek image and reinvented ourselves with a name that better embraces how much we've grown in 30 years. 

Anything's better than cutting some of our best teams again and wasting funds marketing a name that has yet to take us anywhere beyond the state line.

Headline: Despite demonstrations, plans for war proceed
Author: Maria Herrera/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
If there were ever a democracy that listened to its people's concerns and demands, it is now long gone and forgotten. 

If there were ever founding fathers who feared that a government would have too much power over its people, they are not remembered in our history books.

But recently an estimated 30 million people gathered in different cities all over the world to express anti-war sentiment and to condemn actions that would lead the world to a confrontation with Iraq, an action worthy of applause by those who believe in democracy. 

Yet many governments of nations whose cities featured large numbers of demonstrators declared that despite the turnout, war is still an option.

Amsterdam, Bangkok, Athens, Cairo, Madrid, London, Glasgow, Manila, Rome, Paris, Lansing and Sydney are among the 600 cities all over the globe that saw protests and demonstrations.

In the United States, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco saw the biggest display of discontentment, but the demonstrations were not confined to big urban areas. 

College towns like Gainesville and Boston experienced protests not seen since the Vietnam War.

So what exactly does this tell us? 

Are millions of people suddenly siding with Saddam, or are people actually considering the horrors and severe consequences of what a war of the new millennium could bring to the entire planet? Are people being unpatriotic or are they exercising their most patriotic right of all?

After the events of this weekend, it is no longer a secret that millions of people disagree with the way the Bush administration and his axis of evil (Rumsfeld, Cheney and Powell) want to lead this attack on Iraq. 

It is no longer a secret that some Americans question the reasons behind the Bush administration's insistence on going to war.

In fact, it's not hard to link Bush's intense and constant war propaganda with his involvement with the oil business in the past. 

This has led millions of people, in and out of the states, to believe that what is really behind the war initiative is a crusade for that much coveted viscous liquid: oil.

But let's not give the Bush Administration too much credit for ignoring the voices of the people who have elected them into office (or should I say did not elect them into office); other world leaders seem to have contracted the same case of deaf ear. 

Tony Blair declared on Monday that while he understood the moral concerns of the demonstrators, the balance of morality lay with ending a barbaric regime, as reported by The Guardian lastMonday.

Jose Maria Aznar, prime minister of Spain, also turned his back on the thousands of people that took over Barcelona and Madrid to denounce Spain's involvement in a coalition led by President Bush. Thousands of Spaniards are already being sent to the Middle East. 

So we have good news for all of those patriotic Americans who poured out on the streets over the weekend to protest the war: Our leaders are not the only warmongers.

And for all of those who think that the protests were led by a bunch of tree-hugging hippies and "kumbaya" chanters, there is also news for you: Among the most prominent speakers at some of the protests here in the homeland were Nobel Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and actors Susan Sarandon and Danny Glover. 

Is the stereotype broken yet, or shall we continue with the name-dropping?

The crowds consisted of concerned parents looking to raise their children in a war-free world; relatives and friends of victims of 9-11 as seen in demonstrations in New York; students, senior citizens and war veterans who have seen the horrors of war from front row seats; and many more who simply disagree with a war that most of us don't really or fully understand yet.

It is important to recognize the actions of all those who had the courage to stand up and make their voices heard over the weekend. 

It is also important to encourage people, especially young people, to freely express themselves. 

The America of couch potatoes and uninvolved citizens is slowly evolving into an America that cares for, not only what happens here, but also about the well being of the whole world. 

It's strange not to see more students in colleges and universities discussing this issue. These are the people who should be the most concerned. 

What good does a degree do if there are no economies or jobs? 

These demonstrations, more than a call for saying no to war, were a call for us to become active citizens who care about the moral and ethical duties of our nation.

Mallo's letter idiotic

To the editor:

This letter is in response to Drew Mallo's "idiotic" statements seen in [the Feb. 18 issue of] The Beacon. 

How can you possibly think this war on Iraq is justified? I thought the war on terrorism was against Afghanistan and the Taliban. The Iraq situation is about nuclear arms, unless I am mistaken.

Now don't get me wrong, I love this country almost as much as I love my mother country, Jamaica, and I am glad for all that America has offered me, but America is being way too headstrong here and that is not good. You say America liberated itself from being a colony of the British, but at what cost? 

Did Native Americans have a chance to liberate themselves? No! Mass killings did them in and that is what America did in Afghanistan and will do in Iraq. 

You say and I quote, "...when we go into Iraq next week or the following week and liberate this nation the same way we liberated France and Germany." 

We will kill 5,000 innocents but the country will be liberated. Don't worry; we'll drop some Pop Tarts and water to make everything okay. 

Until we hear Iraqi citizens come together and ask for help, their problem is not ours, or we'll have another Vietnam War on our hands.

If America did not stick its nose into everyone's business then we might not be in this situation. 

Now we have to watch our back because of all the nations who don't like us or whom we pissed off. 

Instead of worrying about what weapons other nations may possess, shouldn't Americans first want to know what we possess? 

I'm sure that, we being the super power we are, we have much scarier arms than others do.

Drew, you need a reality check because freedom may come at a cost, but it shouldn't be by spilling gallons of blood. 

You, Bush, and all his cronies need to remember that although America is the big, bad nation we are now, there is always someone bigger and badder. 

I just hope I'm not around when America pisses them off as well.

Misplaced artwork found, 'loaner' program on hold

To the editor:

On behalf of The Art Museum, I'd like to express the appreciation of our registration staff for Marjorie Rizzo's front-page article in the Feb. 11 issue of The Beacon.  

We've had excellent cooperation this week from the university departments in doing our on-site inventory, and that's due in large part to this story.

However, as a point of clarification: the "loaner" program is not permanently cancelled - just on temporary hold for several reasons.  

Chief among these is the inventory process we are currently doing of our entire collection in preparation for the transition to our new storage facility in Broward County, and since this must also be included in the inventory, it will occupy most of our registration staff's time for the next few months, leaving no time to process additional loans.

We are looking forward to resumption of our "loaner" program once this process is complete.

Again, thanks to The Beacon for covering some of our events and happenings this year, and we look forward to even more stories in the coming months.

Dahlia Morgan
Director, The Art Museum at FIU

WINNER
LYPS participants:  Raising just over $2,000 for the Children's Miracle Network at Miami Children's Hospital is a nice way to warm up for Dance Marathon. While I'm sure that everyone here thinks highly of you for your efforts, few will be more appreciative than the kids your efforts will help. 

LOSER
BBC's administration: There are obviously a lot of factors out of your control, but caulk and wood don't seem like a very good solution to the stench that plagues the campus. It may seem like only a small part of the problem, but I'm sure students would appreciate having that concrete cover soon.

There is not much to say about the response to my article last week except to say the person is demonstrating the knowledge deficit that many on the Left demonstrate with respect to war. I am going to use the last article to demonstrate this lack of knowledge and to expose the problems with Leftist thought.

"This letter is in response to Drew Mallo's "idiotic" statements seen in [the Feb. 18 issue of] The Beacon."

Now how did I know that there was going to be an emotional response to my article? As I read this opening statement I automatically knew what would follow. How do you debate emotional rhetoric? I stick to logic when I debate important issues like this because I know emotional arguments are not arguable. They are how you "feel."

The author follows this statement with further knowledge deficit when he proclaims that the war on terrorism is just limited to Afghanistan. You see, folks, this is why I am glad that people like Shane Howard
are not running national security. Even President Clinton recognized Iraq as a terrorist state and bombed them in 1998. So, what is going on here? Why the double standard? It is quite obvious--it is called politics as usual.

What you have to do is put your trust in Saddam Hussein that he will do the right thing--and you have to disregard the fact that Hussein has been noncompliant with UN resolutions (over 15 of them) calling for Hussein to disarm. Why would Hussein kick out the inspectors in the 1990's? Do you think it is because he does NOT have weapons of mass destruction? I do not know when the article in mention was written--but on February 23 the inspectors found banned nuclear weapons---weapons they were not supposed to find. Now Hussein is refusing Hans Blix's request to destroy those weapons. Do people like Shane Howard care about this? No, of course not. The liberals won't march on Baghdad to protest the atrocities the Iraqi people face--but they will march on Washington and protest our President. Double-standard. These liberals trust Saddam--I trust our President.

The author goes on to say that he loves America but thinks we are being too "head strong." If we did not show this type of leadership--could we trust that the UN would be able to contain Saddam? We have already seen how useless the United Nations--an anti-American institution--really is. Did you know that while inspectors were in Baghdad in the 1990's Saddam Hussein was STILL trying to get weapons of mass destruction? 

"You say America liberated itself from being a colony of the British, but at what cost?"

He loves America--yet he has no idea what American is all about. This is the same with most liberals. The cost was lots of blood but the result was freedom. We can talk about the worst war in the history of the world--the Civil War. What was the cost and result? One of the results was a United States of America--another was abolishment of slavery. The cost? Thousands and thousands of lives.

Another quote from the article just shows the delusional state the author is in: "Did Native Americans have a chance to liberate themselves? No! Mass killings did them in and that is what America did in Afghanistan and will do in Iraq."

He compares the "mass killings" on Native Americans to the "mass killings" of Afghanistan? You are comparing apples and oranges first of all. What was the big picture? Afghanistan is becoming a peaceful state. What happened to the Native Americans happened many times in history in different parts of the globe. Do I regret it? No. It was all a part of history. Look at what we have today. We have a nation that stands for peace.

So, the claim that we will kill 5,000 innocent civilians in Iraq may be true--but we are not targetting them. First of all, Hussein is going to do what he did in the first Gulf War--use civilians as human shields. But is not Hussein the evil one and not American soldiers. If your point was that these innocent civilians were going to be American military targets then I would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you. But this is not the case. Thousands of Iraqis may die but the end result is greater. You liberals never look at the "big picture."

I want to reveal one final element: The blame America first liberals. The author blames America for 9/11: "If America did not stick its nose into everyone's business then we might not be in this situation." Is this not disgusting? If it was not for the United States poking its nose in other nations' affairs then nazism would still prevail and the French would be speaking German. The nazis never attacked the United States. We could have just sat back and allowed the continuous slaughter of millions of Jews.

"Drew, you need a reality check because freedom may come at a cost, but it shouldn't be by spilling gallons of blood. "

Tell that to Saddam Hussein, my friend. He is the one who can end this standoff by going into exile with his regime. We already offered this. Saddam Hussein is the enemy. You may claim to love America--but you truly do not know what America is all about.

So, the claim that we will kill 5,000 innocent civilians in Iraq may be true--but we are not targetting them. First of all, Hussein is going to do what he did in the first Gulf War--use civilians as human shields. But is not Hussein the evil one and not American soldiers. If your point was that these innocent civilians were going to be American military targets then I would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you. But this is not the case. Thousands of Iraqis may die but the end result is greater. You liberals never look at the "big picture."

I want to reveal one final element: The blame America first liberals. The author blames America for 9/11: "If America did not stick its nose into everyone's business then we might not be in this situation." Is this not disgusting? If it was not for the United States poking its nose in other nations' affairs then nazism would still prevail and the French would be speaking German. The nazis never attacked the United States. We could have just sat back and allowed the continuous slaughter of millions of Jews.

"Drew, you need a reality check because freedom may come at a cost, but it shouldn't be by spilling gallons of blood. "

Tell that to Saddam Hussein, my friend. He is the one who can end this standoff by going into exile with his regime. We already offered this. Saddam Hussein is the enemy. You may claim to love America--but you truly do not know what America is all about.

Headline: A Little History Lesson for the Left
Subheadline:  
Author: thedrdrew@netzero.com
&nbsp;
There is not much to say about the response to my article last week except to say the person is demonstrating the knowledge deficit that many on the Left demonstrate with respect to war. I am going to use the last article to demonstrate this lack of knowledge and to expose the problems with Leftist thought. 
"This letter is in response to Drew Mallo's "idiotic" statements seen in [the Feb. 18 issue of] The Beacon." 

Now how did I know that there was going to be an emotional response to my article? As I read this opening statement I automatically knew what would follow. How do you debate emotional rhetoric? I stick to logic when I debate important issues like this because I know emotional arguments are not arguable. They are how you "feel." 

The author follows this statement with further knowledge deficit when he proclaims that the war on terrorism is just limited to Afghanistan. You see, folks, this is why I am glad that people like Shane Howard are not running national security. Even President Clinton recognized Iraq as a terrorist state and bombed them in 1998. So, what is going on here? Why the double standard? It is quite obvious--it is called politics as usual. 

What you have to do is put your trust in Saddam Hussein that he will do the right thing--and you have to disregard the fact that Hussein has been noncompliant with UN resolutions (over 15 of them) calling for Hussein to disarm. Why would Hussein kick out the inspectors in the 1990's? Do you think it is because he does NOT have weapons of mass destruction? I do not know when the article in mention was written--but on February 23 the inspectors found banned nuclear weapons---weapons they were not supposed to find. Now Hussein is refusing Hans Blix's request to destroy those weapons. Do people like Shane Howard care about this? No, of course not. The liberals won't march on Baghdad to protest the atrocities the Iraqi people face--but they will march on Washington and protest our President. Double-standard. These liberals trust Saddam--I trust our President. 

The author goes on to say that he loves America but thinks we are being too "head strong." If we did not show this type of leadership--could we trust that the UN would be able to contain Saddam? We have already seen how useless the United Nations--an anti-American institution--really is. Did you know that while inspectors were in Baghdad in the 1990's Saddam Hussein was STILL trying to get weapons of mass destruction? 

"You say America liberated itself from being a colony of the British, but at what cost?" 

He loves America--yet he has no idea what American is all about. This is the same with most liberals. The cost was lots of blood but the result was freedom. We can talk about the worst war in the history of the world--the Civil War. What was the cost and result? One of the results was a United States of America--another was abolishment of slavery. The cost? Thousands and thousands of lives. 

Another quote from the article just shows the delusional state the author is in: "Did Native Americans have a chance to liberate themselves? No! Mass killings did them in and that is what America did in Afghanistan and will do in Iraq." 

He compares the "mass killings" on Native Americans to the "mass killings" of Afghanistan? You are comparing apples and oranges first of all. What was the big picture? Afghanistan is becoming a peaceful state. What happened to the Native Americans happened many times in history in different parts of the globe. Do I regret it? No. It was all a part of history. Look at what we have today. We have a nation that stands for peace. 

So, the claim that we will kill 5,000 innocent civilians in Iraq may be true--but we are not targetting them. First of all, Hussein is going to do what he did in the first Gulf War--use civilians as human shields. But is not Hussein the evil one and not American soldiers? If your point was that these innocent civilians were going to be American military targets then I would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you. But this is not the case. Thousands of Iraqis may die but the end result is greater. You liberals never look at the "big picture." 

I want to reveal one final element: The blame America first liberals. The author blames America for 9/11: "If America did not stick its nose into everyone's business then we might not be in this situation." Is this not disgusting? If it was not for the United States poking its nose in other nations' affairs then nazism would still prevail and the French would be speaking German. The nazis never attacked the United States. We could have just sat back and allowed the continuous slaughter of millions of Jews.

Headline: Men's basketball falls at home; Women lose to Lady Toppers
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers Men's team dropped two more contests this week. Both games were Sun Belt Conference match-ups. 

The team now stands at 7-18 and 1-11 in conference play.

Middle Tenn. 80, FIU 70

Middle Tennessee's William Pippen had a career-high 32 points while Tommy Gunn added 17 as MTSU handed the Golden Panthers its third consecutive loss, 80-70, on senior night at Golden Panther Arena on Saturday.  

Junior Matias led FIU with 20 points before leaving the game late in the second half due to what FIU trainers diagnosed as a sprained MCL. He is listed as day-to-day.

Eulis Baez added 18 points and a game-high nine rebounds. Fab Fisher scored a career-high 15 points in his final game as a Golden Panther.

Carlos Fernandez, Rodrigo Viegas and Nikola Novakovic all were honored along with Fisher in their final home game. 

W. Kentucky 71, FIU 58

Eulis Baez scored 15 points on 67-percent shooting from the floor in a losing effort as FIU fell to the Hilltoppers of Western Kentucky, 71-85, on Wednesday. WKU never trailed in the game and out-shot FIU, 56 to 46-percent.

Viegas out

Men's basketball suffered another blow to an already depleted roster. Senior forward Rodrigo Viegas is out for the remainder of the season after fracturing his patella. The 6-5, 208 pound Brazil native underwent successful surgery Thursday night.

"We are obviously disappointed for Rodrigo in his senior year," said FIU head coach Donnie Marsh. "We were hoping he could make it for the stretch run." 

Coming into his senior year, Viegas was voted third-team All-Sun Belt Conference, after averaging 13.4 points and 6.0 rebounds in 2001-02. Viegas also sat out the beginning of the year after needing surgery on his knee. FIU already has lost star forwards Al Harris and Taurance Johnson. Both were dismissed from the team due to disciplinary reasons earlier in the year.

"This is another adversity the team will have to fight through and I am sure they will respond," Marsh said.

Women's Basketball

Middle Tennessee 61, FIU 57

Middle Tennessee's Tia Stovall scored a game-high 16 points as the Lady Raiders defeated FIU, 61-57, in Murfreesboro, Tenn.  

With the win, MTSU clinched the second seed in the 2003 Sun Belt Conference Tournament.

Cormisha Cotton was a standout for FIU once again, posting her 22nd career double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds. 

Ivelina Vrancheva played all 40 minutes scoring 12 points and dishing out five assists. 

The Golden Panthers shot just 35 percent from the field.
Patrice Holmes had 15 points and 11 boards for the Lady Raiders (16-10, 9-4).

FIU closes out the regular season at home next week when they face Arkansas State and Arkansas Little-Rock at home. Both games begin at 7:00 p.m. 

W. Kentucky 75, FIU 57

The Hilltoppers of WKU clinched the Sun Belt Conference's east division title as the  Lady Hilltoppers defeated FIU, 75-57. 

WKU (17-8, 11-2) has now earned the right to enter the 2003 SBC Tournament as the East's No. 1 seed.

Western Kentucky put the game away with a 13-0 run to start the second half and led by as many as 21. 

FIU (16-8, 7-4) was led by Mandy Shafer's 21 points andCormisha Cotton's 16.

WKU's Shala Reese posted game-highs with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Leslie Logsdon added 19 points.

Headline: Baseball drops 2 of 3 at home
Author: Steve Pherla/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a series highlighted by errors, beanballs and a bench-clearing brawl, the Golden Panthers (12-3) lost two of three games against Bethune-Cookman College (2-8).

FIU 9, BCC 8

Trailing 8-3 in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Golden Panthers, led by senior third basemen Skip Adams, rallied for six runs to defeat the Wildcats in the first game of the series, on Friday.

Adams, who started the game 0-3 with an error, made up for his slow start by leading off the ninth inning with a solo homerun to cut the lead to 8-4. 

With two outs and the bases loaded, first basemen Michael Lopez singled home Luis Rivera and Brian Aragon with a base hit to right field, cutting the deficit to 8-6. 

Senior center fielder Adam Summerell then singled down the right field line, scoring Dennis Diaz and James Knapp, tying the game 8-8 with two outs. 

With the stage set and two men on, Adams finished the comeback he started, driving home Ricardo Nanita with a single to left field, giving FIU an 9-8 win and triggering an enormous ovation from the FIU fans.

The Golden Panther comeback was sparked by a bench-clearing brawl in the eighth inning, which resulted in the ejections of FIU first basemen Bryan Pullin and B-CC third basemen Johnny Lopez, each of whom exchanged shoves.

Freshman Frank Gonzalez (1-0) earned his first career victory for FIU, despite giving up 3 runs in 1.2 innings of relief work.

BCC 8, FIU 6

Bethune-Cookman got revenge Saturday by defeating the Golden Panthers in a game featuring six batters hit by pitches. 

With two outs and FIU trailing 3-2 in the bottom of the fifth inning, BCC pitcher Jahsan Page walked Skip Adams and Michael Lopez. 

Shortstop Luis Rivera followed with a deep two-run double into the left-center field gap, scoring both runners and giving FIU a 4-3 lead.

Adam Summerell added to the lead with a bloop-single to right field in the sixth, scoring Bryan Pulllin, making the score 5-3.

FIU starter Manuel Monreal, who struck out seven batters in six innings, was lifted in the seventh after allowing a single to Juan Figueroa and a double to Johnny Lopez. 

Arthur Santos then allowed a two-run double to BCC catcher Jon Lee, which tied the game 5-5. BCC shortstop Carlos Garcia followed with a single to right field, regaining the lead for the Wildcats, 6-5. 

Things got worse for FIU when Santos fielded a Sebastien Boucher bunt, and threw the ball into right field, scoring Garcia, and giving the Wildcats a 7-5 lead.

Another brawl almost ensued in the eighth, when Lopez homered to deep left increasing the lead to 8-5. As the ball sailed over the fence, Lopez made sure to take time to admire it and flip his bat accordingly, upsetting FIU catcher Michael New in the process.

The next batter, Jon Lee was immediately plunked in the head by a Santos fastball, leading to Santos' ejection. An angry Lee yelled at Santos, but was confronted by New.

"So he hit a homerun. There's no need for him to show up our pitching staff. There's just no need for that," said New, who also hit a homerun earlier in the game.

BCC responded in the bottom of the eighth when pitcher Colin Irvine hit FIU's Skip Adams with the pitch, immediately drawing head coach Danny Price to confront the umpire.

FIU trimmed the lead in the bottom half of the eighth when Solomon Frieder scored on a wild throw by Lee, who was trying to pick off Rivera at first, narrowing the lead to 8-6. 

But that was as close as FIU would get.

BCC 5, FIU 4

The Golden Panthers committed five errors, and BCC starter John Gragg dazzled the FIU offensive attack, pitching a complete game for the BCC victory.

The multi-talented Gragg, who also hits, gave himself some run support in the fourth inning when he hit a 2-run double off of FIU pitcher Luis Gazitua, giving BCC a 3-0 lead.

FIU rallied in the fifth when second baseman Dennis Diaz singled to right field, scoring New, and cutting the deficit to 3-1. In the seventh, an error by FIU shortstop David San Juan gave BCC a 4-1 lead.Peter Kocur took over for FIU in the eighth. After hitting two batters, Kocur gave up an RBI single to Bryan Maples, increasing the BCC lead to 5-1. But with the bases loaded, and only one out, Kocur was able to get out of the jam on a double play ball.

FIU cut the lead again in the eighth when Dennis Diaz scored on an Adam Summerell single, cutting the lead to three runs.

The Golden Panthers then tried to repeat Friday night's ending with another ninth inning comeback. Solomon Frieder led off the inning with a walk. New then sent a John Gragg curveball over the left field fence, this time straightening it out into fair territory, trimming the lead to 5-4. "We were down four coming into that inning, and Gragg was in such a rhythm all day. We couldn't produce any runs. Our whole approach was to break his rhythm. He just left me a curveball out over the plate, and I drilled it," said New. 

Controversy struck again when the next batter, pinch-hitter Fernando Alvarez, was hit by the pitch. Instead of awarding him first base, the umpire declared Alvarez did not attempt to get out of the way, forcing the at-bat to continue. Alvarez then grounded out to first. The next batter, San Juan, was hit by the pitch. Dennis Diaz struck out and Bryan Pullin walked, leaving center fielder Ricardo Nanita as the potential hero with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. But Gragg overpowered Nanita and struck him out, leaving two runners on base and giving BCC its second win of the season. 

Senior Andrew Edwards made his second start of the season, giving up no earned runs in three innings pitched. New, who had referred to the Wildcats as a "bush league" team after Saturday's loss, added, "It's a good rivalry. We just got to keep our heads screwed on straight. We shouldn't lose to them again."

The two sides meet again April 9th and 10th.

Headline: Men's soccer hosts exhibition match with MLS' DC United
Author: Daisy Fernández/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team is back. After having their program cut by university officials last month, the team was reinstated days later. As a result, the program is now looking for ways to attract more community support. 

The squad was excited to compete at home against Major League Soccer's D.C. United on Tuesday. The exhibition contest allowed all contributions to benefit FIU's men's soccer program. With approximately 817 fans in attendance at University Park, the Golden Panthers fell  to the United, 3-0.

DC's most distinguished players include: forward Hristo Stoitchkov, who led Bulgaria in securing fourth place at the 1994 U.S. World Cup, and midfielder/forward Earnie Stewart, who tallied 111 goals during his 14 seasons in Holland.

"It was an honor to get to play with players on this level. To be out there with the likes of Stoitchkov and Etcheverry was a great experience," said FIU sophomore defender Bobby Boswell. 

"We just wanted to go out there and be competitive," Boswell added. "I thought we played well considering the caliber of United."

In the 14th minute, United's Marco Etcheverry directed a free kick to the head of Mike Petke, who scored past FIU freshman goalkeeper Shawn Crowe.

The United upped the score again in the 26th minute, as midfielder Dema Kovalenko took a pass from Stoitchkov and made a goal. The Red-and-Black continued to dominate when Stoitchkov's successful shot pushed past Crowe in the 49th minute.

"The fan support was great, and the officials even donated their paychecks from the game to the Friends of FIU Soccer fund," said head coach Karl Kremser. "This game was important to us because it showed how important soccer is to South Florida."

Last fall, the Golden Panthers finished with a 13-6-1 record and secured a spot in the second round of the NCAA. The team also won the Atlantic Soccer Conference title.

Headline: FIU faculty member beaten, hospitalized
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
An FIU professor is listed in stable condition at Mt. Sinai Medical Center after being severely beaten at the offices of a Miami Beach towing company Feb. 20.

Police arrested three employees in connection with the assault.

According to the Miami Herald, 41-year-old Naseer Idrisi suffered a brain concussion, several fractures to his right leg and a broken nose that night.

When Idrisi, a marine biology professor, returned to his car parked on Alton Road and 15th Street after drinking beer at the Abbey Brewing Co. at 10 p.m., he discovered his car was missing.

Idrisi then headed to Beach Towing, 1349 Dade Blvd., where he was told it would cost $110 to get his car back. His resident parking pass was displayed in the car and it should not have been towed, Idrisi, an Iraqi-American, told the 16-year-old clerk.

The teen insisted Idrisi had to pay and cursed him. The Herald reported Idrisi cursed back in Arabic because "I did not want them to understand...maybe one of them recognized [that I was speaking in Arabic]."

Miami Beach police said that's when the teenager, who was not named in their report, lunged at Idrisi from behind the counter and punched Idrisi in the face. He then began to kick Idrisi when he fell.

That's when Jorge Martinez, Beach Towing's manager, joined the fight, police said.

Although Martinez and the unidentified teen say they knew nothing about a fight and found Idrissi "on the ground in front of Beach Towing," police arrested them and 23-year-old Chris Cruceta, who witnessed the attack.

"Idrissi was definitely the victim, said Bobby Hernandez, police spokesman.

Idrissi did not fight back, police said.

The teen was charged with aggravated battery, Martinez, 52,  with resisting arrest without violence and Cruceta was charged as an accessory.

Calls for comment to Beach Towing on Monday were referred to the law offices of Robert Suitkes, who could not be reached for comment by press time.

Headline: Phi Sigma Sigma, TKE restore South Florida beaches
Author: Angela Castillo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Leaving aside their usual respective philanthropies, sorority members from Phi Sigma Sigma and fraternity members from Tau Kappa Epsilon went to Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park recently to help clean up the environment. 

The park located on Key Biscayne is home of the 178-year-old Cape Florida Lighthouse. After the devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, a restoration program was started to restore the ecosystem and preserve its plants and wildlife. 

"We wanted to help the ecology of South Florida and have a community service event with another Greek organization," Derek Capo, TKE member and Student Government Association business representative, said. "It was the first time both organizations worked for the same cause and the first time we've been involved in environmental events." 

With the sun shining over their heads and the mosquitoes flying everywhere, sorority and fraternity members removed about 500 plants that were affecting the South Florida beaches. Among the plants the organizations removed were Nickerbean, Brazilian Pepper, Lavender and Melaleuca. 

According to the government's Office of Technology Assessment environment program, the Melaleuca is a harmful non-indigenous plant that threatens the ecosystem by causing a decrease in nesting of diverse species and in foraging habitats for endangered species. It also alters topography and soils. 

"[The project] made me realize that there is a present danger to the habitat of plants and animals, and that we are able to restore our natural environment in South Florida," TKE member Danny de los Santos said.   

Phi Sig members could not be reached for comment.

TKE member Anthony Jackson-Pownall said the experience was challenging and educational. 

"It was awesome, it was fun to work together and help each other out," he said. "We all had a great time. I personally felt kind of connected with nature, and I learned the importance of keeping [nature] safe and healthy."

Headline: Lip sync contest raises money for Miami Children's Hospital
Author: Adriana Oliva
&nbsp;
Students and organizations came together in echoes, screams and cheers of "DM... For the kids... DM... For the kids..." during a pre-Dance Marathon lip synch contest to benefit Miami Children's Hospital in the GC ballrooms Wednesday night.  
  Panther Rage, various fraternities, sororities, University Park Towers residents, and Everglades apartments residents  participated in the contest and were judged on creativity, costumes, spirit and how well they performed within their themes. 

"This is by far the biggest and most fun-filled pre-marathon event," junior Maria Garcia said. 

The contest, named LYPS (Letting Young People Sing), is a fundraiser for Dance Marathon, which is FIU's main philanthropic event. Dance Marathon raises money for the Children's Miracle Network at Miami Children's Hospital. All proceeds raised at the events go to CMN.
  Among the eight lip synching acts was a performance by the men of Sig Ep, featuring Sesame Street's Count Dracula and Oscar the Grouch in his debut as a glow stick raver. Everglades and Panther Rage teamed up as EverRage, and performed "Love Train."

Jessica Morffi, UP Student Government Council president, got down and dirty as she danced around as a green monster. There were also impersonations of Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Michael Jackson, as well as Trick Daddy, whose impersonator sang "Trick Love Da Kids."

Phi Mu  and Phi Sigma Kappa won first place with their performance of  Janet Jackson's  "Escapade." University Park Towers came in second and Alpha Xi Delta tied with Alpha Kappa Psi for third.
  During the first three acts, canning took place. Canning is a fundraiser in which organizations collect money in cans. The group that collected the most money during the contest attained spirit points toward the Miracle Cup, which is an award that is given to the group that accumulates the most spirit points throughout all of Dance Marathon's events.
   "The lip synching contest is a fun, alternative fundraiser that lets all organizations of any type participate," Christy Carbot, senior and Dance Marathon Committee member, said.

The contest raised a total of $2,029.75.  Organizations had to pay a $50 registration fee to participate.

Children from CMN were in the audience, and CMN Director Maria Moldes, one of the judges, spoke, thanking FIU for its help.

Headline: Alternative Spring Break offers community service opportunity
Author: Mary Jo Morrell/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If your usual spring break routine - sleeping late, baking at the beach all afternoon and club-hopping until dawn - has lost some of its appeal, then the Volunteer Action Center's Alternative Spring Break program can offer you a different way to spend your time off.

The program, which began at FIU in 1993, gives students the opportunity to help people living in different places throughout the country and sometimes even other parts of the world. Last year, volunteers worked at a Habitat for Humanity site in Wichita Falls, Texas; Anthony House, a homeless shelter in Zellwood, Fla.; and Ground Zero in New York City. 

Students can tailor their experience to their own interests and skills. 

This year they will have a wide range of subjects from which to choose: environmental and educational topics, disadvantaged children or AIDS patients, said Bernadette Galera, a VAC coordinator and two-time participant in the Alternative Spring Break program. She added that a site dealing with issues specific to the Native American community is in the works but has yet to be confirmed. 

When filling out applications, which are available at the Volunteer Action Centers on both campuses - GC 340  and WUC 257  - students are asked to select the area in which they are most interested.

Stephanie Rad, an FIU alumna from the class of 2000 who now teaches emotionally disturbed children at North County Elementary, went on three Alternative Spring Break trips, in which she aided children in Louisiana, Mississippi and New Jersey.

"I had never seen people living in such poverty before," Rad said.  "It really helped me see how lucky I am." 

Site locations are never disclosed in advance in order to discourage participants who are more committed to a vacation than a cause, Bernadette Galera, a VAC coordinator and two-time participant in the Alternative Spring Break program said.

Students pay $100 for the trip plus $25 for a workshop that is required to help participants build teamwork skills, Patty Temino, VAC assistant director, said. Lodging, meals and transportation for the entire week are included in this price, which is low because the program is partially funded by the university, Temino said.

Adrian Carter, Biscayne Bay Student Government Council president, said that this year $50,000 was allocated for the VAC, up from $30,000 last year when individual programs like Alternative Spring Break were funded separately. 

"[The president, vice president, finance chair and a representative from each campus's SGA] meet annually to make budgetary decisions, all of which are subject to final approval by the  Board of Trustees," Carter said.

Of the $20,000 increase, $14,000 will be used to fund this year's spring break program, which is $2,000 more than the amount budgeted for last year, Temino said.

Student coordinators review applications and distribute them to site leaders, who interview potential program participants. 

"There really aren't any special criteria, just a willingness to work and an open mind," Galera said.

Galera said working on a low-income housing project in rural Mexico and teaching homeless kids at an inner-city school in New Jersey changed her life.

"It was a real eye-opener," Galera said. "I don't want to be just another nine-to-fiver anymore. I want to make sure I'm somehow contributing to the betterment of the community." 

Groups numbering from eight to 18 students will leave on March 15 and are expected to return on March 23. Most students will ride in 15-passenger vans to their respective sites. 

Though housing is sometimes provided by the agency with which the group is working, participants should be prepared to stay at hostels or camp out if necessary.

"For a student, the memories are priceless," Temino said. "You make such an impact. You are somebody's hero."

Headline: Chemicals create foul odor at BBC
Author: By Sarah Rodriguez/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If you've noticed a strange smell on your way to Academic II at the Biscayne Bay Campus, you're not alone. Near the building's west entrance, many have whiffed an odor that students and staff describe as unpleasant.

"It smells like really dirty water," production major Abdullah Esmaeel said. "[If] you open any manhole on any street, you'll smell [the smell outside of AC II]."

A major source of the problem is that this entrance of AC II is only feet away from what Richard Penz, a plumber at FIU, said is an acid tank.  

To those who pass, all that is visible of the tank is the heavy plank of wood covering the gaping hole and the concrete surrounding its mouth.   

Malodorous chemicals used in the photography and chemistry labs are often disposed of in the labs' sinks and then pass into and through this tank, Brian Bitar, BBC associate director of operations, said.  The mixture of mild, acid solutions with the water that flows through the tank results in the smell, which seeps out of gaps between the hole and the plank. 

Junior  Kiloma Alexander said that not only does the area outside AC II stink, but that the odor sometimes permeates the entire campus. 

"One of my main reasons for not  trying to get any classes here is because I think the entire campus smells," Alexander said.  "The sewer system must be horrible."

Plans are underway to cover the hole permanently with a piece of concrete, Bitar said.  He said that the delay in sealing the opening of the tank is due to difficulty in finding a concrete cover that fits over the hole. He is currently speaking to a contractor about the installation of a permanent cover for the tank.

"We sealed [the hole] again until we get this new top," Bitar said.

He is referring to a job done recently, during which the narrow openings through which the odor escaped were sealed with foam and caulking.

"It's not a fix," Bitar said. "It's just something we did in the meantime."

Art professor Pip Brant said the stench of sewage has been present on campus since she first started working there four years ago. 

 "It's been stinking," Brant said.  "It's kind of demoralizing. I'm all for the campus looking and smelling beautiful."

The provisional solution to the problem has managed to keep the smell under control. However, the acid tank may not be the only source of this odor around campus. There's a sewage pumping station - more commonly known as a filling station - between AC II and the bus stop. 

Nicholas Sinisi, a trades mechanic for the city of Miami, services the station several times a week. A large fan blows fresh air into a wet well beneath the pumping station 24 hours a day, he said.  In turn, the air exposed to the sewage blows out of the top of a tall metal pole, located on a grassy area between the main parking lot and AC II.  

If there is a malfunction of this fan, the smell may be more noticeable and the dismay of students perhaps exacerbated, Sinisi said. 

"It's a product of the situation," he said.

The smell is aggravated by the proximity of the campus to the North District Wastewater Treatment Plant, where raw sewage from homes all over Miami-Dade County enters and undergoes a complicated series of processes. The sewage is cleaned and solid wastes and pathogenic organisms are removed before it is fed into the Atlantic Ocean.  

The plant exudes a smell detectable from as far away as one mile,  Ron Urban, plant operations supervisor, said. 

"If the wind is coming out of the northwest, you can smell it over at FIU," Urban said.  

Urban also attributed much of the smell around the area to the large population of mangroves in North Miami. A mangrove is a tree that lives near the water and emits a smell of decay much like that of sewage and the odor that was leaking out of AC II's acid tank.  

BBC's almost 200 acres include a mangrove preserve. 

 "What do they call Mangrove Gas?"  Urban joked.  "Sewer gas." 

The contents of the acid tank, the sewage below the fill station, the waste that flows into the nearby treatment plant and the mangrove preserve all have one thing in common - they let off hydrogen sulfide gas.

 Hydrogen sulfide is distinguished by a scent similar to that of rotten eggs. Insects produce the gas and transmit it into sewage - which creates its own gases as it decomposes - thus polluting it with the scent that has made its way into FIU students' nostrils.  

Though some students think the scents that permeate BBC are a nuisance, they are harmless, as naturally produced hydrogen sulfide is hazardous only in extremely confined spaces. Still, those at BBC can do little more than cope with the will of Mother Nature.  

"It's the nature of the beast," Urban said.

Headline: Common fails to resurrect Hendrix spirit
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
I'm not really the hip-hop kind of girl, and for those of you who feel the same way, I have some good news and some bad news about Common's fifth album, Electric Circus. The bad news is that the album is nothing to write home about. The good news is that Common's songwriting stands out for most of the 13 tracks. 

Whereas most of his previous albums are strictly jazz-based, Common has come up with a more eclectic blend of hip-hop, jazz, soul and '70s rock. Electric Circus was recorded in the legendary Electric Lady Studio, Jimi Hedrix's recording playground in New York. Sounds exciting, right? That single aspect of the production is pretty cool, but don't be fooled by the hype. 

The Hendrix spirit of dare-devil rock is lacking. It's commendable that Common integrates a variety of genres into his album, but let's face it: He still delivers hip-hop with a lot of the same cliches that every other hip-hop artist has stumbled upon at one time or another.

 Formerly known as Common Sense, Common is recognized for the poetry of his songwriting. His talent is definitely noticeable on paper and it sometimes seems like he can match his soulful lyrics to any beat. To help in the creation of Electric Circus are his friends Erykah Badu, Sunny from P.O.D., Mary J. Blige, Prince and a large crew of other artists. 

OK, so I've never heard of Vinia Mojica or Laetitia Sadier or even the majority of these so-called guest "stars" but at least it means we won't be hearing the same voice over and over, and that Common won't be singing monotonously for 13 straight tracks. 

By far, the best track on the album is "Jimi Was a Rockstar," sung with Erykah Badu. It's almost like the duo is meant to perform together. 

Still, that is definitely not the only reason for liking this song. Just by looking at the title of the track, it becomes obvious the song is a tribute to one of the greatest rock musicians of all time: the one and only Jimi Hendrix.  How appropriate considering the birthplace of this record.

Another noticeable track is the 10-minute-long "Heaven Somewhere," not only because of the numerous artists who sing in it (Omar Lyefook, Bilal, Cee-Lo, Jill Scott, Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu and Lonnie Lynn) but also because of its atypical lyrics. Each artist sings about his or her view of heaven and what it means. This one struck me as unique because it stands out from all the songs that have been written about the deaths of artists like Notorious B.I.G., Tupac and Aaliyah.

 "Ferris Wheel" is pretty cool because of the African language, guitars and drums used in the composition. Granted, I can't understand any of the words, but it's still good listening. Then we have "Electric Wire Hustling Flower," which features Sonny of P.O.D. 

Don't ask me to explain the meaning of the title because I am just as confused as the next person. This song would have potential if Common wouldn't have felt the need to yell rap lyrics into a microphone. "Come Close" is somewhat sentimental, focusing on the emotional feelings he has for his unnamed love interest. 

This song is the only one on the entire album that we can actually hear Common's smooth voice do what it does best. 

"I am Music" sounds like he went back to the same jazzy mode he used on his last album. The only pleasant part of it is listening to the brass instruments. Nothing so extraordinary. 

You all know what it's like when your finger is drawn to the "next" button on the dial. 

Well, if you haven't experienced that need, just listen to "I Gotta Right Ta." I can't place where the irritation stems from. Is it in the title itself? Or is it the annoying chorus? 

I must say that I give Common credit for trying to be different on this album, but if Electric Circus isn't nominated for a Grammy, no one will be surprised.

Headline: Powerful Balseros depicts refugees' struggles
Author: Lisa Galvez
&nbsp;
In the summer of 1994, a team of journalists shot and interviewed seven Cubans and their families before embarking on a risky journey to seek the American dream. They are part of the 1994 Cuban rafter exodus, when Fidel Castro allowed his people to emigrate legally for a short amount of time. This part of the story premiered as the short film "Balseros" at the 1997 Miami International Film Festival.

Five years later, directors Carles Bosch and Josep M. Domenech have interviewed the original refugees for this feature-length version, which adds an hour of footage to the previous film.  

The newly extended version offers a close perspective of their struggles, their destinies, their new life in the United States and what they have become. Amidst the feelings of homesickness and displacement, some of the refugees adjusted and some did not.  

They left Cuba escaping from economical difficulties with high hopes. The film illustrates the harsh realities they face as immigrants in the U.S. and the dreams they had envisioned for themselves, lost along the way. 

Guillermo Armas adjusted with ease after reuniting with his wife and daughter, who were already living in Miami. Others, like Rafael Cano, have lost contact with their family back in Cuba. Misclaida Gonzalez illustrates the agony that some found themselves in. She finds herself lost in a dirty, dark world of drug dealing and prostitution.  

These directors have made a compelling film about survivors of our time. They grasp human emotions with ease. The audience roared with laughter or clapped for  scenes that touched them. 

The subtitles closely captured the essence of the Cuban people but, as is usually the case, they didn't do justice to the comical parts or of showcasing their culture. 

Between the music and scenes of La Havana, Guantanamo Bay, and the U.S., the directors placed us there with the refugees. We feel their anguish, their fears, pain, happiness, and their alienation as they step into a new country. 

The story was told in great detail, which proved to be both a good and bad thing, it felt a little too long. But the film keeps your interest throughout. 

The film, which screened at the Gusman Center Saturday, opened with an introduction of the director. The directors expressed a little disappointment with the audience turnout. "I don't understand why more people didn't come. This isn't a political film, it's a story, a story about a group of people; a story that comes from the heart," said Bosch. At the end of the film, the audience was surprised with a visit from three of the refugees who appeared in the film. The audience was able to ask any questions.  

The directors ended on the note that part of what made this film possible was getting the people to open up. "The Cuban people were very easy to work with and open up," Domenech said. "Good journalism is getting people to open up to you. We became good friends with these people." This was an excellent documentary and is recommended  for anyone who likes stories about human survival and the quest for freedom.

Headline: Comedians tickle student funny-bones
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
FIU's Comedy Connection brought some excellent comedians for a night of tummy-aching laughter last Thursday.

Comedians Malik Shanon, Kyle Grooms and Talent certainly put on a much better show than did comedians Angel Salazar and Tony Roberts during January's show.

Malik's claim that he was no thug and his hypothesis about being a "bitch" if he went to jail was hilarious.

But of course, ethnic jokes are always the center of attention, and FIU's diverse crowd made it so much more the case.

Without a doubt, Cubans provided the most inspiration for both Shanon and Grooms, with Haitians following close behind.

All three comedians varied in style. Grooms' almost bilingual performance with his Tony Montana accent and salsa choreographies were enough to make one cry with laughter.  

Grooms' ability to laugh at himself and his semi-dorky attitude really added to the originality of his style.

His dramatization of "The Incredible Hulk's" final scene and the high pitched theme song took the audience back in time.

However, the peak of his performance came when Grooms told jokes about The Titanic and Cubans.

Just like the two other comedians, Talent followed the tradition of picking on the DJ, and then warned the audience in a half-serious tone to not take anything personal and reminded the crowd that the show was all about relaxing and having some fun.

This was certainly appropriate because the New York comedian began his performance by imitating deceased rap legend The Notorious B.I.G. He then went on to make jokes about the sniper incident and faint whispers of shock mixed with guilty laughter traveled throughout the crowd.

After this, Talent's performance took a lighter turn as he moved on to less controversial topics, such as sex. Holding a beer bottle in his hand, the comedian made jokes on everything from porn to voyeurism. 

Talent's crazy facial expressions and ability to imitate a variety of sounds and voices proved how versatile the comedian can be.

The highlight of the night came when Talent attempted to make a creative dramatization of the first caveman who tried oral sex on a woman. 

He was able to finish his dramatization, which ended up with a broken stool, loud rant, and a hysteric audience who clapped incessantly.

Overall, Comedy Connection provided great talent for this show and the crowd enjoyed  good laughs and left the stressful student life behind for two hours.

Headline: Lesbian Russian pop duo provokes controversy
Author: Robert Gratmage
&nbsp;
What happens when you add a video dirtier than Christina Aguilera's to a catchy pop/electronica song with vocals as sweet as honey?  You get a number one hit in Russia, Australia, Europe, the U.K. and Colombia, not to mention a spot on MTV's "TRL" countdown. 

t.A.T.u. (a Russian play on words meaning "She Loves Her"), a lesbian duo from Moscow, has become the latest pop music sensation with their English debut album, 200 km in the Wrong Lane. Record sales are budding for 18-year-old Lena Katina and 17-year-old Yulia Volkova with some help from the controversy surrounding their on-stage make-out sessions and choice of wet t-shirts and briefs as proper performance attire. Nevertheless, the negative stigma surrounding their behavior does not seem to affect their attitudes as they state on their official website: "t.A.T.u is about saying what you feel, not what others expect. Be in love. Be yourself. We are." 

Flirtatious friends Katina and Volkova both grew up in Moscow, attended formal music schools and got to know each other while singing with the Russian children's group "Neposedy." Their first single as a duet "I've Lost My Mind" debuted on Russian radio in 2000, and since then they have sold over a million albums in their native country and all around Eastern Europe. 

Last year they recorded their English debut with Trevor Horn, (Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Pet Shop Boys producer) and released it in America with Interscope Records.

The girls' first English-language single "All the Things She Said," has been steadily climbing the U.S. Billboard charts while their steamy video, depicting the girls kissing and caressing in the rain in prep-school uniforms, has hit "TRL" debuting at number 10 on Feb. 7. 

Many have called to have the video banned from "Top of the Pops" (a British video countdown similar to "TRL") and MTV, calling the content raunchy and tasteless, but there seem to be more fans than opponents. The majority of the public's responses to this video prove that the argument for banning videos such as this and Madonna's "Justify My Love" is outdated. 

Regardless of its controversy and popularity, 200 km in the Wrong Lane stands as an interesting mix of bubbly vocals with dark, sentimental lyrical content accentuated by amazing electronic production. t.A.T.u. contributes their sweet, hopeful yet somewhat tormented lyrics, such as their next single "Not Gonna Get Us" about the difficulty of living as a gay youth in Russia, to their album.

The album, written about them (not by them), contains several upbeat, poppy tunes such as "All the Things She Said," "Clowns (Can You See Them Now)"and "Malchik Gay" as well as smooth, darker songs like "30 Minutes," "Stars" and "Show Me Love."

Will t.A.T.u. turn out to be a one-hit wonder propelled to popularity by controversial kisses or are they the new club queens of the next decade? Who knows?

I wanted to write about Danielle Bienenfeld's review of Common's Electric Circus album. Why was she picked to review the album? The very first sentence she uses in her review (I'm not really a hip hop kind of girl..) discredits her entire review. If I am reading a review on a hip hop album, I would expect the critic to know what they're talking about. The examples she uses to justify her opinion are weak. She doesn't do a good job of describing the album's flaws. It really does the album (and hip hop in general)a disservice to get criticized by a person with such little knowledge on the topic.

&nbsp;
Shane Howard's rebuttal of Drew Mallo's submission carries severe flaws that need to be addressed. Drew submitted a piece that was well thought out and compelling. Opinion aside. Shane Howard reverts back to the usual Beacon editorial publishing's in the standard emotional, contradictory, and rambling tone that we as readers have come to expect. 

I would like to take a second and address Mr. Howard's remarks.

"How can you possibly think this war on Iraq is justified? I thought the war on terrorism was against Afghanistan and the Taliban. The Iraq situation is about nuclear arms, unless I am mistaken."

Well Shane, for those of us who don't have our head in the sand, the connection between Iraq and terror is all but obvious. Not only has Saddam Hussein admitted to sponsoring terror campaigns he has also authorized and launched attacks against the US and US interests, thankfully he failed. Even if there is no formal tie to Al Queda (and there almost certainly is) Saddam is still a danger and a threat.  The lesson that most of us learned on 9/11 is that these threats need to be addressed and dealt with. Your sophomore status indicates that you probably in "your mother country" and not here during the attacks. It was a scary time, even here at FIU.

"Until we hear Iraqi citizens come together and ask for help, their problem is not ours, or we'll have another Vietnam War on our hands."

The above is a clear indication of your ignorance. Not only is that not the purpose of the US lead campaign, but people who stand up to Iraqi policy are often beaten, tortured and or killed. The people of Iraq are repressed.

"If America did not stick its nose into everyone's business then we might not be in this situation."

You may be right. But if we didn't than we might all be speaking German and living under a 3rd generation Hitlerian regime. In addition, keep in mind that the reason countries like France, Switzerland and Germany can "stay out of it" is because time and time again the US has been there to bail them out. We as the super-power, need to take action to arrest these rising threats. 

I'm sure that, we being the super power we are, we have much scarier arms than others do."

The difference is we do not have a history of using those arms against our own people. Saddam does. Clearly he is dangerous. 

"Drew, you need a reality check because freedom may come at a cost, but it shouldn't be by spilling gallons of blood."

World History (not just US) dictates otherwise. Take a History elective. You still have time.

In closing I would like to leave Shane and the other readers with this history lesson. Taken from the Presidents most recent State Of The Union Address;  

This threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America.
