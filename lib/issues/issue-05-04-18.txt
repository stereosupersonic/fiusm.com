TALLAHASSEE, FL - Secretary of State Glenda E. Hood announced today an 
exhibition of oil paintings by Miami artist Patricia Rottino Cummins. The 
exhibition entitled "Biscayne Botanicals at the Capitol" will be on display in the 
Cabinet Meeting Room from April 11, 2005 through July 8, 2005.

"We welcome this extraordinary body of work by this talented artist to the 
Cabinet Meeting Room," said Secretary Hood. "The colorful paintings of Patricia 
Rottino Cummins truly express the incredible beauty found in some of our 
state's natural flora and fauna."

In her own expressive and vibrant style, Cummins has created a unique series of 
oil paintings depicting the magnificent, yet fragile and often unnoticed, plant 
life commonly found in Biscayne National Park. With over 95% of its 172,000 
acres covered in water, the park is home to a wide range of plant species which 
Cummins eagerly captures in her bold and dramatic works. "My goal as an artist 
and a painter is to "arrest motion," and communicate the beauty found in 
nature," states Cummins. "To make my viewers look again at what we normally 
take for granted is what I find most important in my work." 

Originally from New York, Patricia Cummins is a fine arts instructor for Miami-
Dade Public Schools, where she has worked for the past 26 years. She is also an 
adjunct professor at Barry University and a resident artist at ArtSouth in 
Homestead. She holds a B.A. from the City University of New York, and an M.S. 
in Art Education from Florida International University. 

This exhibition is part of the Florida Department of State, Division of Cultural 
Affairs' Capitol Complex Exhibition Program. For more information, contact Erin 
Long at 850/245-6475 or visit: www.florida-arts.org.

Headline: Tennis star wants to go pro after graduation
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Ranked No. 36 in the country in women's singles, Colombian Paula Zabala has prove that she is a force to be reckoned with on the court. So far, she has led the Golden Panthers to a No. 45 ranking nationally and a perfect record in the Sun Belt Conference.

As Zabala and the Golden Panthers eye a conference title after finishing third last year, The Beacon sat down to get acquainted with the unheralded rising star of FIU sports.  

Q: How did you get started in tennis?

I started because my mom used to play tennis, and I used to go with her when she used to go and play. I would pick up the balls and just be around the whole court watching her. I started hitting and she got me into it. I started playing when I was five years old. 

Q: Where did you go to high school?

First I went to Calusa, a private school here in Miami, and then I moved to home-schooling, because I wanted to play more tournaments, and I wanted to travel. I traveled around a lot, playing a lot of tournaments, so I did home-schooling for 10th, 11th, and 12th grades in Laurel Springs School, a school in California but it was considered home-school. 

Q: Coming from the west coast, what made you decide on FIU?

I was undecided as to whether or not I was going to play tennis and try and be a pro, or I wasn't sure what I was going to do. Since I live here, I was like, why not come here to FIU? It's closer to my house, to my family, and I can start doing my schoolwork and at the same time try and play pro and for college of course. 

Q: Assistant Coach Carlos Casely is also your personal coach. What is it like working with him on a daily basis?

Well, its really good since I know him from before, and now he's the assistant coach. So, it's really nice that he knows my game and what I have to improve on - my ground strokes and everything that I have to do ... my technique. So it's a good thing he's always there helping me and always giving me good advice ... and with Ronni they make a good team. It's much better to have someone that I know.        

Q: How long have you been working with Coach Casely?

Since I came to the states; I came here when I was 12, and I was looking for an academy to start playing at here in the U.S., and I went to his academy and that's were I started. It's been eight years now with Carlos. 

Q: Taking a look at the record, the team is 3-0 in the conference and ranked 45 in the country. What are your expectations for the rest of the season?

We have conference coming up. We are pretty excited, and hopefully we can win it and go the NCAAs. I think we have a good chance. As a team we are doing well. We feel confident and we have a good chance to go out and win the whole Sun Belt Conference. 

Q: In the last poll that came out on April 5, you were ranked 36 in the country in singles. How has your play this year differed from your play last year, when you first became a 1?

It's different because last year I wasn't very mentally prepared. I didn't have that much game; I wasn't playing that many matches. Now throughout the whole season I have been getting more mature and mentally tough, and that has helped me to improve and stay in every match. 

Q: How tough is the competition against other 1's?

It depends. Usually they are all tough matches. Some of them are better than others, but whenever you play 1 they are all going to be good players and it's always tough. As long as I can get mentally ready and know what my game is and know what I am supposed to do for every point, it's tough, but as long as I do the things that I'm supposed to do, I'll be fine. 

Q: You still have two years of eligibility left. What are your goals for the next two years?

As I play here, my goals are to be the best and play as well as I can in improving my game and hopefully, that will show as maturity on the court and improve my rank. Hopefully at the end I can be in the top 20 or even top 10; those are my goals in terms of ranking. 

Q: What are you going to do after you graduate from FIU?

I'm planning to play. I want to play some tournaments, some satellites playing pro - that's what I want to do the most.

Q: Finally, who is your favorite tennis player?

My favorite player is Anastasia Myskina. She's from Russia. She is very tough on the court, and she fights for every ball and she is always in it. She doesn't give up. I like the way that she is mentally ready every time.

Subheadline: COMMENTARY

&nbsp;
The semester is almost over and FIU professors will soon finalize the grades we hold so dear. With that in mind, I've traded in my books for a red pen. So, if we're getting graded, then why shouldn't FIU's baseball team?

No pluses or minuses given. 

Attendance is mandatory. 

Class participation is factored into the grade.

Starting pitching: B

David Asher has become the ace FIU needed. When he's in control, he's dominant. His 6-0 record with a 2.64 ERA and 64 strikeouts prove it. 

Elih Villanueva is FIU's best freshman pitcher since Derek DeCarlo in 2002. Armed with a filthy breaking ball and a 6-2 record, with a 4.03 ERA, he's a contender for the Sun Belt Conference Freshman of the Year award.  

The reason for the 'B' is the other starters. Ammer Cabrera's control problems have led to lots of walks and hit batsmen, and he might be benched for good after South Alabama rocked him. Occasional starter Jon Banke has not pitched well, so don't be surprised if Frank Gonzalez, who's been great in long relief, gets a chance to start.

Bullpen: F

If Gonzalez becomes a starter, it makes an already shaky bullpen a lot shakier. Closer Danny Hernandez started the season strong, but it's been a different story lately. Three of his four losses - tied for the team lead - have come in the last two weeks, and he's given up six earned runs in his last six appearances. What has saved him from the bench is that only Gonzalez has pitched well in relief.

Junior Matt Rainey has struggled all season with an 8.83 ERA in 16 appearances. Leo Calderon, a major part of last year's bullpen, is hurt. Other than lefty Chris Siebenaler (who's been decent), no one else has been used consistently. The Golden Panthers might have to turn to Denny Hernandez, Les Rodriguez, Ricardo Humaran and James Knapp to see if any of them can handle the late innings.

Defense: C

Head Coach Danny Price made fielding a top priority after FIU finished last in the conference in defense last season. FIU had the highest fielding percentage in the conference early in the season, a big reason why they started 18-8. 

FIU has slipped ever since. Their 22 errors in Sun Belt play are the highest in the conference. Almost everyone in the infield has struggled, including defensive stalwarts first baseman Mike Lopez and shortstop Luis Rivera. 

When FIU wins, they average just over one error a game. In their losses, they average three errors. If they find a way to reduce their errors, wins will come.  
	
Offense: A

Seven hitters are batting over .300. Right fielder Yahmed Yema is leading the team, flirting with a .400 batting average. Yema already has 10 more RBI better than he did all of last season and he has tied his 2004 home run total (9). Third baseman Nick Cadena - a career .249 hitter - is hitting .375. Center fielder Dennis Diaz's on-base percentage has jumped over 30 points from 2004.

FIU is second in the nation in stolen bases with 94, behind only UCF. They've scored at least five runs in 20 of their last 22 games, and eight of those games saw 10 runs or more. But bad pitching and errors have wasted much of that production. 

Coaching: B

I salute hitting coach Chris Holick for the job he's done. 

Almost everyone in the lineup has improved from 2004.

Pitching coach Tony Casas must figure out who can give him quality innings out of the bullpen, and find a third starter who will be consistently decent. 

Price's aggressive offensive style has usually paid off, but he may need to start showing a quicker hook when his pitchers struggle. Better defense must be a priority, too. 

Non-conference play: B

While a 19-9 record is way better than the 15-19 record FIU put up last season, the reason for the 'B' is its lack of wins against quality teams. 

In 2004, their record against top-25 teams was 2-5. This year, it's 0-4. Other than series wins vs. St. John's and Rutgers, FIU hasn't fared well against teams that are post-season regulars. That will become an issue should it need a post-season at-large bid to enter the College World Series.

Conference play: D

The only reason I'm not giving an 'F' is because FIU won two of three games in the opener against a much-improved Arkansas State ball-club. However, the one game FIU lost saw it blow two late-inning leads and that has become a trend. 

When FIU lost two games at New Orleans, it blew a six-run lead in one of the games. 

The team blew two more leads in both of their losses to South Alabama. Good teams don't blow leads, especially to a Privateers squad that is 10 games under .500.

FIU will face a tough Sun Belt team in the next week, top-25 ranked Louisiana-Lafayette. If they can find a way to win that series, they should be fine heading into the weak part of the conference schedule.

Overall Team Grade: C

Headline: Golfer admires hard work, new home
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
When Rebecca Samuelsson stepped foot on the FIU campus at the beginning of the Fall 2003 semester, two things were evident:

"Everything is a lot bigger [in Miami]," said Samuelsson. "Everything is a lot quicker."

Fresh out of her Swedish high school, Katrinelundsginasiet ("They always spell it wrong," she said), it was hard for Samuelsson not to compare Miami to her homeland.

"People are more open [in Miami]," Samelsson said. "Back home, we don't say 'Hi' to everybody, like here ... It's a lot different."

But the main reason she's here?

"The weather [and] the golf courses."

In Sweden, Samuelsson played in the highest level of junior golf and earned many accolades for outstanding performances in tournaments, such as winning her club championship eight strokes over the second-place finisher.

So when it came time for her to go to college, her national coach gave her a list of schools well-suited for Samuelsson's playing style.

Samuelsson sent applications to many schools, and FIU golf coach David Pezzino was the first to send her a reply.

"Everything sounded good, [even though] I really didn't know about the school," Samuelsson said.

But despite that she is the best player on the FIU team statistically and is ranked seventh in the Sun Belt Conference, and despite all her previous accolades, Samuelsson did not pick up golf until late in her childhood, at the age of 12. 

Her best friend at the time was going to a junior golf camp and she decided to tag along. It was there where she was discovered by her future national coach, who was running the camp.

Some would expect Samuelsson to admire countryman and elite golfer Annika Sorenstam in above all others, but she truly admires anyone who shares a similar trait with her.

"I look up to anybody that works hard," Samuelsson said. "It can be someone who's not that good, as long as they try the best they can. I'm a hard worker, so people that work hard impress me."

Samuelsson gives up a lot for the game she loves, mainly things most people are not willing to give up. She rarely goes to the beach, only when her family comes to visit her.

"We usually practice every weekend, so there is no time to go," Samuelsson said. "Even on the weekends I have off, I'm usually very tired."

She almost always practices by herself and puts in the most practice hours on the team. She even puts emphasis on the non-physical aspects of the game.

"I work on my mental game," Samuelsson said. "I talk to psychologists to get the right thinking going."

And what is the right thinking going into a golf tournament?

"One shot at a time," Samuelsson said. "You can never think about the end score. You always have to think about the present. Once you hit a shot, that's gone. You can't do anything about it."

    In the game of golf, thinking about a bad shot can mess up your whole performance. But doing extremely well can also mess you up.

"In my first tournament, I played so good my first nine [holes], I was leading," Samuelsson said.

However, she says she became complacent and didn't do so well in the final nine holes.

"When I play a tournament, I don't really look at the other girls I'm playing [against]," Samuelsson said. "I'm more into my own game. But you can see other girls - their mental game affects their [overall] game so much."

Her 16-year-old brother also plays golf. Samuelsson says he is a "real talent," but his overall game gets affected because of his mental focus.

Samuelsson also does some weight training, claiming it gives more stamina during tournaments, especially 36-hole ones. According to her, the most tiring aspect of the game of golf is walking  through the course to hit her ball, because college golfers are not provided with golf carts.

Despite her accolades in Miami, and not to mention the weather, Samuelsson still misses Sweden, but is torn between both places.

"When I'm home, I miss being [in Miami]," Samuelsson said. "And when I'm here, I miss being home."

Student finds death penalty article poorly researched

I was disappointed to read Dara Bramson's opinion piece on the death penalty. It is understandable that an editorial will be slanted, but Bramson should have researched the topic before attempting to address Beacon readers. 

She conveniently glossed over the fact that for every seven people executed on death row an innocent person is exonerated as being wrongly convicted. Bramson could have discovered this with a simple search for "death-penalty" on Google. 

Television shows like Law & Order make people think that DNA evidence is always available, but the reality of the justice system is that cases are largely circumstantial. 

Witnesses lie or are confused, evidence is withheld from the jury, and jurors are human, therefore capable of making mistakes. 

So exactly how does Bramson reason that the convicted are almost certainly guilty? 

Another search with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement would have shown that the number of murders in Florida (a state with the death penalty she currently lives in) went up by 5 percent in 2004. 

Maybe these new murderers did not receive the memo about the death penalty making crime less frequent. 

Forgive me for momentarily standing on this soap box, but America is a nation in which rights are valued and should be protected, not cast aside simply because a few people fear for "the innocents" as Bramson mentioned. 

I am much more comfortable in my ability, as well as that of most American parents, to protect my own children than I am in the justice system not allowing innocent people to be convicted and executed. 

Perhaps the next time a member of The Beacon staff forms an opinion and attempts to convince readers of it, he or she can provide the FIU community with one that is more responsible or at least one that makes sense.

The war in Iraq is a more pertinent issue

It seems to me that Mr. Muela has too much time on his hands when he wrote his piece on "cell phone disease." Clearly he should use his time more appropriately and be more concerned about pertinent issues that affect young Americans, such as that 1,000 plus have been unnecessarily slaughtered in an unjust and expensive war. 

Our country is considered a pariah in the eyes of the world, and young people are going to have to bear this financial cross for years to come. 

Also, he should be aware that he, like other young people, might still get called to be sacrificed when this administration leaves Iraq in shambles and takes on Iran in the not so distant future. 

I believe ending this debacle and saving our brethren's lives has more precedence than eliminating cell phones.

FIU does not re-hire psychology professor

FIU is undergoing some dramatic changes. In the Psychology Department there has been a continuous fluctuation within its faculty and staff, along with the arrival of a new department chair. 

Since last semester, students have begun to voice their disagreement with numerous decisions, such as letting go of some of our most influential educators. Thus far our efforts have been in vain.

This semester we are yet again experiencing a great loss. Dr. Kelly Laurence who has been an adjunct for 10 years is not being re-hired, very much against the students' will. We have met with the chair to express our disapproval and we were given a series of excuses. The first was that it was due to a budget cut.

This does not suffice for several reasons: 1) Other adjuncts will still be teaching (who have not been teaching as long as she has.) 2) New faculty is being hired (and they get paid more than adjuncts). 3) New buildings are being constructed and remodeled constantly, and the library has new computers at every desk. Does money appear to be the real issue here? 4) Our tuition is continuing to increase at an alarming rate. 

We are paying more money than ever before, yet the quality of our education is diminishing. This is an injustice! 

Unlike most professors, Kelly Laurence does not teach for the money or the prestige, she does so for the students only. Her goal is to transmit her knowledge and prepare us for the future. 

We were informed that new faculty is being hired because they will bring with them money in the form of research grants, and prestige for FIU. Perhaps the university's priorities are not the same as the students'. 

Due to Dr. Laurence's tremendous impact on our lives, we feel very strongly about our cause. We are currently expressing our discontent in the form of letters, a petition (posted on the psychology bulletin board, DM, second floor) and a rally held on April 19.

Headline: Unhealthy choices
Subheadline: School cafeterias phase out junk food
Author: Dara Bramson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
During a question-and-answer session with fans on March 5, the final day of the Arnold Classic, the annual bodybuilding contest that bears his name, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger explained some of his motives to promote health awareness. 

"First of all, we in California this year are introducing legislation that would ban all the sale of junk food in the schools," said Schwarzenegger. 

According to CNN, he also said junk food will be pulled from school vending machines in favor of healthier foods, including fruits and vegetables.

Arnold Schwarzenegger may be one of the only political figures that has not blatantly lied to the United States. "I'll be back" was no exaggeration. Due to his integrity, we can trust that his current endeavors will likely be accomplished as well. Now that he's back and in full force, Schwarzenegger is in the process of preparing the United States for "Terminator 4: Rise of the Fatties." His first invasion: public schools. 

Much of the action toward a healthier country is originating in public schools. Among these proactive schools are several elementary schools in Kissimmee, Fla. 

According to a report on CNN.com, six schools there are participating in a study by a research center founded by Dr. Arthur Agatston, author of "The South Beach Diet". 

The objective of the study is to see whether school cafeterias are capable of serving more nutritious food, whether kids will eat it and whether their health will improve. Half of the students did not eat their lunches at the beginning of the year. 

Grade school kids are accustomed to pizza and chicken nuggets, and getting used to whole-wheat bread and grilled chicken for many of the students was difficult. At the beginning of the school year, each child's height, weight, blood pressure and pulse was recorded. In April, these numbers will be reevaluated to determine any change.

Just imagine the new vending machines: G2 gets you a rotting apple; F6 gets you a moldy carrot. Sounds to me more like a scheme to eradicate children with a new strand of E. coli. In all seriousness, the plan, if executed well, could potentially work wonders. 

Kids spend an enormous amount of their adolescent life at school. If at least one meal and snack are consumed at school, what they are consuming based on availability can potentially affect their health. 

Though schools are beginning to take action, it is the parents who need to reinforce those healthy decisions affecting the other two-thirds of their children's diet. 

If Junior Amy Harmon was a parent, she wouldn't be likely to advocate the diet plan the school board is presenting. 

"I think sometimes when a kid is having a rough day or needs a little sugar boost, they need junk food," said Harmon.

Benjamin Clark, a junior at Palmetto High School, expressed his outrage regarding the new changes. "Apparently the school board is under the assumption that by eliminating sodas we are somehow benefiting. Rather, we are suffering. When going to lunch, the last thing I want is chocolate milk to quench my undying thirst," said Clark.

At Mill Creek Elementary School in Osceola County, the process of adjustment may take a while for the students. However, it is inevitable that after a while, kids will simply get hungry and use their lunch money for junk food. 

With that said, these are encouraging signs. I do not see this as infringement. If a parent is fattening their child up for the yearly pig roast, by all means, he or she is free to send them to school with a pillowcase full of candy. 

Seeing as I'd probably be 10 pounds thinner if public schools didn't have Skittles at my disposal, it's impossible for me to disagree entirely with the endeavor to put more healthy foods in schools. Though I do not think any harm can come out of encouraging students to eat healthier, ultimately, it is the parents who need to help bring this lifestyle change into their child's life, not the school cafeteria workers.

Headline: 25 YEARS LATER
Subheadline: Mariel influence still felt throughout Miami community
Author: Giovani Benitez / In-Depth Editor
&nbsp;
This is part one of a two-part series on the 1980 Mariel boatlift and its effects on the South Florida community 25 years later.

As dawn broke over the Port of Mariel in northern Cuba 25 years ago, Cubans from all over the communist country knew their lives were about to change.  

For over 125,000 Cubans, a historic five-month mass exodus began on April 20, 1980.  

Just two weeks prior, thousands of Cubans stormed into the Peruvian embassy in Havana to seek political asylum. It was then that Fidel Castro opened the Port of Mariel to Cubans who wanted to leave.

Author Mirta Ojito, who recently published Finding Mañana, a detailed book on Mariel experiences, was just 16 years old then.  She came to the United States on the Mariel boatlift and a quarter-century later, understands what the boatlift represents to the community.

"It means that we have a responsibility, and we are marked by an exodus that changed Cuba, changed Miami, changed South Florida, and in the end, ended up changing U.S. immigration policy toward Cuba," Mirta Ojito said.

For Mirta Ojito, it was April 23, 1980 when Mariel became a personal issue.  "You are going to el norte," a sobbing aunt told her that morning.  

Sadness overcame her.  

"It was a terrifying moment. I had gone to the doctor the day before and I had my eyes checked, so I had been given a drug to dilate my pupils and I could hardly see," Mirta Ojito said.  "I didn't know if it was the tears, or the fact that I couldn't see, but I do remember, almost immediately, that my vision was blurred."

Mirta Ojito did not leave Cuba until May 11, when some 4,500 refugees arrived in South Florida.  It was her uncle, FIU Accounting Coordinator Oswaldo Ojito, who made her destination a reality.

"I said, 'This is the time to get the family out.'  When the opportunity came with the Mariel, I went in a boat to get them.  I stayed for 17 days in the Mariel bay waiting for the Cuban authorities to let me bring the family over," Oswaldo Ojito said.

The boat he acquired for the trip was called Valley Chief.  On the day Oswaldo Ojito was given permission to take his family to the United States, the engine on the Valley Chief wouldn't start.  

Just when the Ojito family thought their journey was over, they came across another boat with a generous captain. This vessel was appropriately named Mañana.

Mirta Ojito used that name for the title of her book.  She describes the boatlift through her own eyes, but provides an in-depth look at what Cuba was like before Mariel and what other Marielitos experienced in 1980. 

"I'm trying to show what life was really like in Cuba in the 1960s and 1970s, which is the reason why, all of a sudden, in a span of five months, 125,000 people would leave," Mirta Ojito said. 

"I had already lived through so many disappointments," Mirta Ojito continued. "And I had especially seen the acts of retaliation against so many Cubans simply because they committed the so-called sin of wanting to leave their country, that I was ready to go myself.  I no longer wanted to live in that kind of country, where people threw eggs and tomatoes to their neighbors and called them horrible names simply because they wanted to leave Cuba."

Oswaldo Ojito said the Mariel is proof of what he calls terrible conditions in Cuba and is certain that if the way was opened once again today, half of the Cuban population, if not more, would flee to the United States. 

Whether or not a Cuban exodus could happen again, most agree that those five months in 1980 served as a turning point for South Florida and the nation alike.

Mirta Ojito said the 25 years after the boatlift have served as a time of reflection for Marielitos, many of whom work as lawyers, doctors, journalists and psychologists.

"There's been enough time for those who could to prove themselves, and I think Marielitos have proved themselves exactly as earlier waves of immigration from Cuba have, and others that have yet to arrive or have arrived since 1980 undoubtedly will," Mirta Ojito said.

Headline: Promotional items cause higher turnout vote
Author: Michael Haines / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Over six times the number of students from last year voted in this year's Student Government Association elections on April 5 and 6 at the Biscayne Bay Campus. Six hundred forty students cast their ballots - the second highest turnout in BBC history, according to Sarah Davis, Campus Life office manager. 

According to Rafael Zapata, assistant director for Campus Life at BBC, funding made the difference in this year's elections. "We spent about $2,000 on promotional items for this election, and I am pretty sure that is more than in past elections," said Zapata.

Zapata stated that Vicky Owles, assistant director for Campus Life at University Park, could provide better information on the money spent for the election.

"We had to spend a little more money than usual, because we were transforming to the new Panthersoft system, but the rest of the election was paid for from the same budget and has not changed since last year," said Owles.

Owles stated that Campus Life receives a yearly budget of $6,000 to cover the cost of the major elections in the Spring semester and the special elections in the Fall semester. Owles was unable to supply the total cost for this year's election because the final figures haven't been tallied yet.

The promotional items for the election included flyers, t-shirts, banners, stickers, buttons and balloons.

"We had a red carpet, easels, t-shirts and posters at the polls on election days, and we even had  [donated] bagels," Zapata said.

The donated food may have helped the turnout.

"It was a very active campaign during election week, but it might have had something to do with them offering free food if you voted," said junior Leskaria Ransom.

"Whatever it takes to get them to the polls," Zapata said in response to Ransom's comment.

Not all of the students needed to be enticed by the food, however.

"I wanted to make sure the right person got [elected]," said junior Mirlande Germain. "I voted because of the issues ... like having to pay for the bus to [UP]. If we have to pay it should be on a semester pass basis."

Germain also offered  a reason for the poor turnout last year.

"[The presidential candidate] was running unopposed," Germain said.

Unlike at BBC, the University Park campus SGA elections only saw an increase of 66 voters from last year to this year - a small percentage of the over 3,800 students who voted there.

Headline: NASA sponsored lecture inspires students, faculty
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Fifty-three scientists attended the NASA-sponsored seminar, "Blazar Variability Workshop II: Entering the GLAST Era," held April 10-12 at the Kovens Convention Center at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Participants included theorists, professors and students of physics and astrophysics from all over the world, who shared results of their individual research on electromagnetism - perhaps a future energy source for the earth, based on outer space processes.  

Junior Greg Azarnia and graduate student Humberto Velasquez, who collaborated with organizer Dr. James Webb in the physics department at FIU, displayed their study of visible light on posters at the seminar. 

"My favorite part [of this seminar] has been hearing what these people have to say and their interactions," said Azarnia. "You can't get that from any book or any paper - that's why these lectures are so important." 

David Thompson, a Maryland-based astrophysicist representing NASA, said that the space agency will launch a new satellite telescope named GLAST in August 2007. He said that the telescope would be capable of clearly detecting gamma rays - the most powerful source of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum - in energy jets billions of light years away from the earth. These jets come from quasars and blazars, bright objects with black holes in the center that suck in matter and then squirt out electromagnetic waves at nearly the speed of light. 

"Blazar jets are pointed at the earth," explained Thompson. "If they were in our galaxy, their powerful radiation would roast us."

The participants were experts in different types of radiation, presenting their observations and findings in relation to blazar jets and variability to the scientific community gathered at the conference. 

"NASA realizes that in order to make the best use of this [telescope], we need to work with all kinds of scientists, and this conference brings that," Thompson said.

Webb, a physicist, emphasized the importance of the coming together of the scientific community. 

"This conference was designed so people could form collaborations," said Webb. He explained that the scientists sought to draw from each other's conclusions to reach a better understanding of blazars, whose jet processes could one day lead to the harnessing of an energy source even more efficient than nuclear conversion.

NASA provided a $15,000 grant for expenses such as food and the renting of the conference center for the seminar, Webb said, while the FIU physics department contributed $2,000. 

In addition, Webb  said the Southern Cross Astronomical Society, an amateur scientific group, sponsored Professor Vladimir Hagen-Thorn, from Russia's St. Petersburg State University. His career as an astrophysicist spans four decades. Hagen-Thorn gave a lecture entitled "Variable Sources in Active Galactic Nuclei."

At St. Petersburg State University, he had been the mentor of Svetlana Jorstad, a guest speaker on high frequency blazar jets.  

Jorstad has become a senior research associate at Boston University. She collaborates with Boston professor Alan Marscher, who gave a lecture on the imaging of blazar jets. 

Lectures consisted of Power-Point presentations, scientific jargon and inside jokes on blazars. They lasted 10 to 30 minutes and were open to questions and discussion. University of Michigan's Dr. Hugh Aller, a pioneer in extragalactic radiation research, gave a final summarizing lecture. His colleagues dedicated the conference to him. 

On April 11,  a special banquet was held for the scientists at the convention center.

"The banquet was excellent. We had London broil and sang space songs," Webb said. 

Webb and Marscher sang and played the guitar to their original compositions about blazars and outer space. Webb's songs can be found on his demo CD, "Out in Space." He also sings them to lower division physics classes at FIU.

Headline: New BBC gym on pause due to erroneous design
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In September 2004, FIU's Student Affairs announced the construction of a new gym, set to stand at 10,000 square feet between the Wolfe University Center and the Olympic-size pool at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

It was scheduled to open the following August as an easy-access fitness center connecting both facilities. However, there's still no semblance of a new BBC gym. 

According to Greg Olson, director for Student Affairs at BBC, demolition on the future gym's site along with underground work began in August 2004 and has just ended. He said the reason for the delay in the construction was an erroneous design for BBC's underground structure of pipes and communication lines, which had to be corrected before work could begin. 

The budget for the construction remains the same at $1.7 million, which comes from the portion of the university's trust fund reserved for the improvement of its property or capital improvement.

Olson said the construction of the facility could begin as soon as April, but he could not give an estimate as to the completion date. Meanwhile, Elias Bardawill, assistant director for BBC's Campus Recreation, said the gym could be ready as early as January 2006. 

Bardawill said his department has no control over the starting date of the construction, although it is very excited about it. 

"This is definitely a step forward in campus development," Bardawill said. "The campus is in great need of its own fitness center - it'll help foster campus life." 

The current BBC gym, a 2,400 square foot facility, is located on the third floor of the Wolfe Center and has 33 machines. 

Fitness clerk Nancy Audain compared the gym to an office and said that, during her four-hour, three-day weekly shifts, at most only 30 people come in to use it. 

With the new BBC gym, Audain said she hopes comparisons to the University Park campus gym will subside. 

Bardawill said that while UP's new gym will have 40,000 square feet, BBC's will be 20,000 square feet larger, including the aquatic center. 

  "Our usage is going to skyrocket, based on the connection with the aquatic center," he said. "You can't only think of it as a [new] gym - it's a mega recreation center."

The blueprints for the future fitness center reveal a modern-looking, brightly painted facility with 45 machines, six offices (including one exclusively for the swim team), locker rooms, a conference room and a separate adjoining aerobics room and dance studio. Bardawill said Campus Recreation intends to extend its operating hours and the number of fitness classes available.

Recreation team leader Joey Casanova said they plan to add mostly cardio, resistance and free-weight machines because of the high demand by students and faculty. 

Among the machines available at the current gym, some will be refurbished for use at the new gym. The old space in the Wolfe Center will then be vacated at FIU's discretion.  

The new BBC gym won't come too soon for some students, who have been demanding improved facilities.

"Come on now. We have such a lame gym compared to [UP's]. We need more cardio machines, more space [and] more of everything," said junior Jennifer Rodriguez, a frequent user of the current BBC gym.

Headline: Alpha XI Delta's 'A Knight to Remember' proves successful
Author: Mailyn Mederos / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Alpha XI Delta sorority, founded in 1893, presented its 4th annual XI Man Pageant on April 12. Pi Kappa Phi senior, Brian Swenson, won the XI Man title among 13 contestants.

The event entitled, "A Knight to Remember," raised over $2,000 from donations and ticket sales. The proceeds will benefit Choose Children, which works with disabled, abused or neglected children in need of medical assistance.

Alpha XI Delta's philanthropy mission statement reads: "Children deserve the opportunities to develop to their fullest potential - intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically - in an environment conductive to the development of character ..." 

"It was very successful; we made over $2000, which is double of what we made last year. I've been working on XI Man since December and we started promoting the event two months ago," said Junior Vanessa Canals, Alpha XI Delta's vice president.

 The contestants represented various fraternities such as Sigma Phi Epsilon, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma Alpha Mu, Pi Kappa Alpha and Phi Gamma Delta.

They competed in categories such as "Best Features," "Most Talented" and a "Worst Case Scenario." 

The top five finalists had to answer this final question: What do you think should exemplify the next Alpha XI Delta Man and what would you do to make sure those characteristics are followed?

FIU Golden Dazzler and sorority sister Luli Duarte entertained the audience, while the judges chose the top finalists.

Albert Gonzalez, from Sigma Phi Epsilon, was the second runner-up and Malik Wilkes, from Pi Kappa Alpha, was the first runner-up. 

"I'm very honored that Brian [Swenson] took the time to come back for four years. It shows dedication and that's the XI Man we want," said Senior Christine Denton, Alpha XI Delta's president.

Swenson, next year's homecoming director, has been competing for XI Man since the pageant began four years ago.

"I feel great," said Swenson. "It has been four years in the making and it finally happened! I get to represent an awesome group of ladies."

Swenson spent a couple of months brainstorming for the talent segment; he sang, did kung fu moves and created a PowerPoint presentation. 

"I think Brian was a great choice because of his dedication to FIU and his good character," said junior Monica Borcegue, a sorority sister majoring in finance. 

Jessica Franchi-Alfaro and Alex Prado, last year's XI Man winner, hosted the show, which ran from 9 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.

The pre-sale tickets were $5 and the door tickets were $7.

During the past year Alpha XI Delta has held other philanthropic events including a baby item drive, Relay for Life, Fuzzie Football Tournament, Fall Ball, Halloween candy drive, a toy drive and car washes.

"It has been one of the best [XI Man Pageant] turnouts ever. We had a great turnout from different organizations, whether they were participating or watching. I couldn't imagine being a judge because all the candidates were great," said Denton.

Headline: Tropical Chinese pleasantly surprises patrons
Author: Erik Tirums / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Being a culinary professional and new to the Miami area, I've enjoyed tasting my way through the city to learn about its food culture. 

From sushi at Doraku, to four-star dining at Norman's, my personal experiences have been broad but have not  included a great experience with Chinese food. Until now.

Tropical Chinese sits on the west side of a dingy shopping plaza. With skepticism, my party and I walked in, only to be immensely surprised and delighted. It felt like walking into a restaurant in New York City's Chinatown. Red lanterns hung everywhere in a dim restaurant accented by a huge performance window showing the well-trained cooks. A chest next to the hostess stand held all the awards, accolades and rave reviews from Gourmet Magazine, Zagat survey, as well as The Miami Herald and The New Times. I had stumbled upon Miami's most critically acclaimed Chinese restaurant.

Luck was on our side that night as we were seated right next to the performance window, through which 10 experienced chefs cooked on huge woks atop gasoline firepits. Our dim sum (appetizers) included fantail shrimp wrapped in wonton chips, shrimp egg rolls and Chinese spare ribs. The entrées included orange flavored beef, XO sauce prawns and seafood fu-chow fried rice. All the cuisines were prepared in front of us, and though each had its own character and flavor, they  were all fresh, very hot to the touch and correctly prepared.

The fantail shrimp, deep fried in wonton chips, were crisp, light and not greasy at all. The ribs fell off the bone. The prawns were perfectly cooked, but not overcooked, and the beef had rich ingredients but was still  light because of the orange zest accents.

The fried rice was cooked in a casserole dish which was almost New Orleans style. I am a fan of spicy, rich cooking, which is what the dishes might have lacked. But the freshness and quality made up for a taste that doesn't suit all diners.

A Lychee Nut Martini made with Ketel One vodka was the perfect apéritif. The lychee's raspberry but almost floral flavor is delicious with any Asian cuisine, and I enjoyed plum wine with my dinner. Tropical Chinese also offers an extensive wine list, wines by the glass and a full bar.

The dining experience was well orchestrated by a large and  experienced staff. Drinking glasses were rarely left empty and our food arrived in a timely fashion. 

The cooks in the kitchen clearly cared about their craft as they stole glances at our plates to see how we were enjoying them. The timing in the kitchen was so perfect that no heat lamps were used for food, and it still arrived at the table piping hot. A minor complaint about the service would be the bus staff that many times left dirty dishes on the table.

Dinner even ended perfectly with sake soaked orange slices and light vanilla fortune cookies. From the unassuming outside, to the pleasant surprises inside, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.

Headline: Guess Who?
Subheadline: Revamping a classic children's game for college-age fun!
Author: Raquel Cool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you have 24 friends, you can make your very own Guess Who? game. 

This project requires a lot of commitment, but the final product is a great way to show off your friends. Try mixing nostalgia with the present by axing the cartoon strangers and replacing them with tiles and tiles of familiar faces.

To do this, you'll need a frame for the tiles. Invest in a knock off version of Guess Who?. They are sold at Wal-Mart in a set with three other games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Pseudo-Connect Four and Snag 'em. Or, you can keep your eyes peeled and try to find a real Guess Who? game at a thrift store ...  but don't hold your breath, because the chances are slim.

Once you have a game at hand, set up the plastic frame without including the provided tiles of cartoon faces. 

Now you're ready to embark on the most tedious part of the project: begging your friends for suitable digital pictures of themselves -  "suitable" being the operative word. 

You'd think that in this Myspacian day and age, you could easily access the selection of pictures that are already available, but clever angles and bathroom mirror shots don't really work for this.  

Instead, make sure you ask them for a clear, head-on shot with no parts of their face cropped out of the picture. Looking back, I got so impatient that I started to sculpt digital foreheads in place while I waited.  

Even when you have the pictures, you'll still need to edit them. This project is significantly easier if you have experience using a digital editing program such as Adobe Photoshop, which is available in the FIU library on the computers with scanners.  

To begin, choose a background that stands out. Instead of using a simple color, opt for quirky and familiar objects with texture to make the faces pop out more. The background should not be too busy-looking; it should compliment instead of distract. 

I decided on macaroni and cheese, provided by Google Image Search. Other ideas are watermelon seeds, grass or french fries.  

Here's some technical information: Crop the background to 200x302 pixels for each tile. The faces should pasted on, sized approximately 125x170 pixels.  

The featured font is called Cooper Black, size 30.  

Once you've completed all 24 tiles, print out three copies of each. One is for each of the two frames, and the third is for the separate deck of face cards. 

Before you cut out the printed tiles, glue the back of the sheets to wrapping paper so that they have good looking backings. Now, you're ready to cut. 

Refer to the Guess Who? frame to measure how to cut each tile. Make sure to practice first so that you don't mess up.  

Once your game is set up, you're ready to play! Invite all the friends featured in your game for the unveiling of your creation. An advantage to having a personalized version of the game is that the clues don't have to be limited to physical characteristics.  

For example, instead of asking about the color of someone's eyes, say, "Is this person obsessed with sushi?" 

Be weary - this friendly game can easily turn into a gossip-fest.

Headline: New Fall Out Boy single shows promise for up-coming album
Author: Nicole Diaz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
You either love Fall Out Boy or you hate Fall Out Boy. You either think they are God's gift to music, or you consider them equivalent to the gum on your sneakers. 

Either way, you will probably still feel that way after hearing their first single, "Sugar, We're Going Down" off their upcoming album, From Under The Cork Tree. 

Fall Out Boy have been on the tip of everyone's tongue. Rolling Stone put them on its "10 Artists to Watch" list. They were at the top of Alternative Press's Reader's Chart for months with their last album, Take This to Your Grave, and have yet to leave the list. Alternative Press has also hailed From Under The Cork Tree as one of the "Most Anticipated Releases of 2005." Take This To Your Grave has sold over 200,000 copies and incited legions of fans so dedicated that some have tattooed the band's lyrics onto their bodies. Now, that's devotion. 

Straight out of Chicago, Fall Out Boy rose from the ashes of local hardcore bands. The pop-punk quartet recorded their debut full-length, Fall Out Boy's Evening Out With Your Girlfriend, for Uprising Records. The music found its way onto the Internet, and the band's popularity skyrocketed in no time. 

After being courted by tons of major labels, Fall Out Boy landed upon a pretty sweet deal: Island Records and Fueled By Ramen made an arrangement in which Fall Out Boy would record their next album for Fueled By Ramen but with a budget set forth by Island. In turn, Island would then be able to decide if it wanted Fall Out Boy on its roster with their following album. 

This worked out nicely for the band, as they got points for having a highly respected indie label put out their album, while still having a major label budget to work with. That fueled by Ramen album, Take This To Your Grave, became a huge success and earned the band a level of fame they had only dreamed of. 

If the new single is any indication, then From Under The Cork Tree should only secure Fall Out Boy's popularity. They have perfected the pop-punk sound, finishing where The Starting Line left off and achieving what bands like Simple Plan and Good Charlotte wish they could sound like.

"Sugar, We're Going Down" is more of that winning formula that has gotten Fall Out Boy so far so fast. The lyrics are a story about a boy lusting after an unattainable girl and are emo enough to stir sentiments in even the Terminator. Vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump sings, "Isn't it messed up how I am just dying to be him," causing to everyone who has ever had such a crush to relate and keeping it personal.

And of course, there is the chorus. This song has a hook that will be stuck in your head for months. Highly energized choruses are part of Fall Out Boy's signature style, and this one is so catchy you physically can't help but sing along. 

The melody to the first line, "We're going down, down, in an earlier round, and sugar, we're going down swinging," gets your toes tapping and will have you singing along by the second verse.

As catchy as the hook is, it's repeated about eight times throughout the song, and it is only a matter of time before it gets boring. So many repeated choruses leave underdeveloped verses, which are, at best, weak. 

For a brief moment, it almost seems as though Fall Out Boy has run out of ideas, and if that is the case, the album, which is scheduled for release May 3, will not be worth anybody's time.

Headline: BOOZIN'!: A guide to turning 21
Subheadline: How to: A series by Alicia Bustamante
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life Page Designer
&nbsp;
Birthdays are a time for growth and reflection. They're the days when you can look to the past and see how in a short year, you have matured and gracefully taken one step closer to full-fledged adulthood. Except of course, when you turn 21. In America, 21 means it's time for some dirty, raucous, illegal, sexual, animalistic interaction - in other words, the greatest party this side of the Mason-Dixon Line. 

The necessities to throw (and survive) a successful 21st birthday party are numerous. While many of us know the basics, it's difficult to grasp all of the nuances that turn a good party into a great one. Here's the low down:

A Time and a Place

No good party has ever started before midnight. While technically it may not be your birthday anymore, you're really just celebrating a concept anyway. This gives you enough time to prepare, compose yourself and get any pesky "family time" (aka birthday cupcakes at the local Sizzler) out of the way. 

 As far as location is concerned, you want to choose a place that you don't mind eventually turning into Mt. Trashmore. If you have it at your house, make someone (who intends on being sober) in charge of loss prevention. 

The last thing you need is to find someone booty dancing with Mima's 3-foot-tall porcelain statue of San Lazaro at 3 a.m. 

If you're the kind of person who goes to school and holds down a job (or two), I cannot stress enough the importance of asking for time off. If possible, request to have both the day of your party, and the day after, off. You'll need the time to recover or to at least piece together the awesome fragmented memories of the night before.  

Decisions, Decisions...

Ah alcohol, the sweet lubricant of social cogs. Choosing the right stuff to have at your party is essential. You're going to want to have a keg, even if it acts as a Lojak for all fraternities in a 30-mile radius. 

It's important to have a good variety of liquor, but don't bend over backwards trying to please everyone's taste. You should never have to bend over backwards on your birthday. Well, except for the occasional kegstand.

Tell everyone to bring their own liquor and stash some for yourself on reserve. 

You really don't want someone to scream "The keg's out!" and have everyone scramble for the last drops of your Grey Goose. 

Your first drink of the evening should be somewhat ceremonial. You can toast to health and wealth if you like, but most likely, your toast will be that finally the binge-drinking you've been doing every weekend is now legal (see graphic above). 

"May I bring a friend?"

The answer to this question is tricky. Just think of it as a formula: For every person you allow to come, that is another piece of your mom's china you can consider broken or missing. 

To think of it even more mathematically, let's say that you invite 50 people. If each person invites two more persons, then you have 150 people at your house, and 2/3 of them don't even know it's your birthday. Once your original invites start drinking, that 1/3 won't remember either. 

Oh, the humanity:The Aftermath

At around 2:37 p.m. the next day, you'll wake up and groggily try to compose yourself in order to start cleaning. 

Forget about the two heaping piles of vomit in your room. You won't remember if they're your piles, but there will be time for DNA tests and beat downs later. Discourage your dog from lapping up the beer and bong water and get to work. 

If you were smart, you asked your good friends for two things: alcohol and janitorial back up. 

When the smoke clears, you'll find the destruction immense and the journey treacherous, but if you can sucker some friends into cleaning for - or rather with you, it won't be so bad. 

Attempt to remedy the massive hangover you've acquired and check your e-mail for some kick-ass digital camera pictures of the night before from your friends. Then you can proceed to sit back and smile while you think to yourself, "Wow, who brought the sheep?"

Enjoy yourself and never forget the cardinal rule for turning 21: The less you remember, the better the party was.
