Headline: With Fiedler gone, Dolfans happy
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Hootie and the Blowfish said it best: "I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry."

That tiny piece of lyric is the most worthwhile thing to come from Hootie and his blowfish, because it perfectly describes me and any other frustrated Dolphin fan at the end of every football season.

A few days ago, that part of the song held true for me, again. But this time, it related to tears of joy rather than disappointment.

What I read on the ESPN Bottomline that morning proved to me that prayers do get answered, regardless of how long it takes.

"Miami Dolphins Release QB Jay Fiedler"

I couldn't believe it. After five years of wanting Jay Fiedler out of Miami so badly, I thought I was getting delirious; my mind was playing tricks on me. But after a double, triple and quadruple-check, I realized my dreams had become a reality.

I know what you're thinking: "Wow this guy has real crappy dreams" and "This guy's an idiot!  Fiedler had the fifth-best winning percentage out of all starting quarterbacks since the year 2000." 

OK, maybe not those thoughts exactly, but if you did, you'd be absolutely correct. 

However, just because he had the "fifth highest winning percentage" doesn't mean much. 

Most Dolphin fans will tell you that watching Fiedler lead an offense is like eating a chilidog from 7-11. Sometimes you'll be just fine, and sometimes you'll get minor indigestion, but you're most likely going to get diarrhea.

It was unbearable to watch him play at times. Before every game, everyone knew that a Fielder interception was inevitable. Even in games when the Dolphins were just dominating the opposing team, Fiedler would throw an inconsequential interception, just to remind the fans that he's still the old Jay.

Fans wanted him out so badly that every backup quarterback the Dolphins signed was automatically a fan-favorite. But that experiment failed miserably - more than once.

In 2002, Ray Lucas performed exceptionally well in the preseason and fans wanted him to be the starter. However, the coaching staff, who shall remain nameless, decided to stay with Fiedler. They knew he was crap to begin with, but they didn't want to look like they picked a bust quarterback.

So when Fiedler went down with an injury, Lucas came in, played outstandingly mediocre, and the Dolphins were 2-4 with him as the starter. Fielder knew his job was in jeopardy, so he played outstandingly and earned his job back just to spite me.

He did the same thing for the next two years with Brian Griese then A.J. Feeley. Almost like a formula:

New backup comes to town. Fans want new guy to start. Coaching staff spites fans and puts in crappy Fiedler anyway. Fiedler throws interceptions. Fiedler overthrows receivers. Fiedler gets sacked. Fiedler scrambles and fumbles. Fiedler gets injured. Backup comes in and plays like MVP. Fiedler gets jealous of new guy. Fiedler puts Voodoo spell on new guy. New guy begins to struggle. Fiedler comes in like a savior. Fiedler knows his job is safe. Fiedler plays like crap again. Fiedler gets contract extension. I asphyxiate myself.

Now, I don't have to worry about the haunting image of Fiedler throwing a football into double coverage, fumbling the ball after a 20-yard scramble or his elephant ears springing out when he removes his helmet on the sidelines.

Even though Feeley has been named the new starting quarterback, for now it doesn't really matter as long as it's ABBJ-Any Body But Jay.

Headline: Football starts spring practice
Author: Nikolay Orekhov and Harry Coleman / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
With the loss of his first graduating senior class, Head coach Don Strock started Spring football early this year to get in an extra couple of weeks of practice to begin seeing what type of players he has.

The biggest position to fill is the running back spot. After becoming the first FIU player to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season, Rashod Smith has left a void in the Golden Panthers backfield since he graduated.

"Hopefully, Rashod won't be our last 1,000-yard rusher," said Strock on the first day of  practices. 

The candidates to replace Smith include redshirt freshman Julian Reams, who worked with the first team, and senior Adam Gorman, who shared the load on the first day, hoping to impress the coaches.

Julian will be given an excellent shot at playing time, and we'll see where the new freshmen running backs coming in this fall fit in when they get here," Strock said.

One freshman running back looking to make an impact this fall is A'mod Ned. The Northeast running back is a two-time All-Broward performer and was the county's leading rusher last season with 1,635 yards on 202 carries.

The Golden Panthers are also looking to improve their depth at quarterback, where Josh Padrick (last year's starter) and David Tabor are the only true signal callers in camp.

Chris Patullo, who is working with receivers and will also placekick, is the team's third string quarterback coming this spring.

"Josh and David looked good for their first day out," Strock said. "Both are excellent students. They work hard and never complain. They're going to get a lot of work this spring and give a lot of work to the wide receivers and tight ends."

Redshirt freshman QB Tavares Kendrick will sit out part of Spring football in order to concentrate on academics.

Shotgun



Throughout the past three seasons of Golden Panther football, Strock has rarely used shotgun, citing that his team was young and not ready for such a move. 

However, with experienced quarterbacks like Padrick and Tabor, Strock has felt comfortable for the first time using the option in practice.

"I think the guys are far enough along in our system and [the shotgun] is something that we probably need to do in certain situations; not every play, but we want to be able to do both," Strock said. "They didn't look too bad today, but tomorrow is our first day in pads-it might be a little different then."

Headline: Donations keep solar-powered construction house on track
Author: Monica Zacarias / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With less than nine months left to complete a 500-square-foot solar-powered home that will cost $300,000 to complete, the College of Engineering got a huge boost recently as two organizations donated money toward the project.

President of Bobek Building Systems, John Bobek, sold FIU a steel cage at factory cost and Miami-Dade Commissioner, Katy Sorenson, donated $5,000 toward the FIU decathlon team. 

The team is finishing the project to compete in the 2005 Solar Decathlon to be held by the U.S. Department of Energy this fall.

The cage, needed to hold up the structure of the house, is energy efficient. Typically, steel cages cost about $60,000, but thanks to the Bobek donation, it will cost the project $30,000. 

Through her discretionary fund, Sorenson donated $5,000 to the development. This fund, she says, is distributed every year to organizations she wishes to aid.

"We are so happy to have Katy working with us," said Stephanie Strange, Solar Decathlon coordinator. 

Although Bobek donated the steel cage at cost, FIU needs more money for materials such as appliances and flooring. 

"Money is the main issue, and the process is cumbersome, but we are enthusiastic about this project," said Strange.

FIU will compete against high-ranking universities including the University of Michigan, Virginia Tech and Cornell University.

"I went to see what has been built so far in January and we stand strong. I believe that FIU will easily finish in the top three," said architecture student Josh Freese, who has been with this project from the beginning.

According to the faculty advisor for Construction Managment, Professor Ronald Baier, the chance to compete on a national stage will be important for FIU.

"This is a great opportunity for FIU to be recognized on a national level," said Baier. "It is important for students to participate with each other. Through this project, they are learning real life lessons through discipline. [The project] demonstrates the viable use of solar energy."

In addition to the construction cost, the solar-powered house must also be transported to Washington D.C. 

According to Diane Marshall, the group task leader, the team has designed a modular home which will be built at FIU, taken apart, loaded onto a truck and reassembled again in Washington.

Once in Washington, the team members will participate in a three-week-long demonstration at the National Mall where judges from all over the United States will evaluate every one of the 18 competitors expected to attend this competition.

Judging is set to take place Oct. 7-15. The winner will be announced in the middle of the day on Oct. 15.  

The solar-powered home must be able to maintain all the comforts of a regular electrically-powered home including temperature control, computers and a washing machine. Not only will the team be judged on efficiency, but it will also be judged on architecture and design. 

"The students who participate in the Solar Decathlon walk away with real-world project experience. They gain leadership, human resources, budgeting and research skills. Perhaps even more importantly, they learn about the environment and that they can make a difference - a positive difference," said Marshall.

The team is optimistic about their chances of winning this fall.

"We have a shot of winning," Strange said. "This is the coolest project we've ever done. We are competing against old universities who have been open for a 100 years and can get sponsorship easily. We want to prove that just because we aren't endowed with a lot of money, that doesn't mean we don't have the talent."

Though money is the primary concern, Strange feels that FIU can win this competition because of the house's all-glass architecture. She feels it represents Florida's creative and imaginative ideas. 

"The most crucial part of this project is to raise money. We need the funds for our supplies. Without the money we don't have the resources we need to compete with other universities who easily attain funds," Strange said.

According to Strange, there is a proposal pending in which the U.S. DOE will contribute $40,000 toward the project. In return, FIU will leave the solar-powered home in Washington for exhibit all year long.

Headline: $41 million project to expand UP housing
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Circling the once-busy Parking Lot 14 by the University Park Housing Quad, the chain-link fence set up by the Turner Construction Company on Feb. 28 signaled the first building phase of a new 250,000 square foot residence hall tentatively known as Lakeview Housing.

"I went to visit a friend at Panther Hall the other day, and I was surprised to see all the cars gone from the parking lot," said junior Mike Del Rey, a student living in the UP Apartments. "[Friends] told me what it was for, but I didn't even know they were going to build more [residence halls]."

According to  James Wassenaar, the Director for the Office of Student Affairs, Auxiliaries, and Operations, the construction of Lakeview has been in the planning phase for the past two years.

"[University President Modesto A. Maidique] made it clear that he wanted to see an expansion of on-campus housing, and that's where this project comes in," said Wassenaar.

The objective of the president's plan is that 20 percent of the university's enrolled students live on-campus within the next 10 years. The residence halls at both UP and Biscayne Bay Campus currently hold a combined 10 percent of enrolled students.

Lakeview, which will hold 825 beds and will raise the on-campus population to 3,000 students, is expected to cost up to $41 million, making it the most expensive construction project currently at the university.

Upon completion, the FIU Executive Council will decide the residence hall's official name.

"The project will serve both freshmen and other undergraduates," Wassenaar said. "We currently have an excess of 400 students waiting to live on-campus, so this may be something that will benefit all those interested in taking a full part of the FIU community."

Besides the residence hall, plans are also being made to establish an additional dining service area near the Residential Quad for the use of on-campus students.

"With so many new beds in the area, it's very likely that additional dining services will be needed," Wassenaar said. "We're currently planning and making assessments on how to serve those students' needs."

A fund of $3.5 million has already been allocated toward the dining service area, which is expected to begin development by 2006.

However, as more planning is placed into buildings for future resident students, those who currently live on campus have already had problems dealing with the construction.

"I know I'm going to deal with all the noise that [the Lakeview project] brings," said junior Ryan Waxberg, a resident of Everglades Hall whose room window directly faces the construction area.

Another problem Waxberg brought up is the parking situation caused by the closing of Lot 14, the parking area for both EH and the University Park Towers.

"I found out last Tuesday that I needed to move my car from the lot by Wednesday, because there was a letter on my door. I didn't get any real warning," said Waxberg.

To accommodate students and their vehicles, the Office of Housing and Residential Life cleared both Lot 6 and spaces within the Blue and Gold Garages as parking for students with residential decals only.

"Much of the construction on campus, including Lakeview, had to wait for the new parking garages to become operational in order to begin," Wassenaar said.

"We've anticipated all this. We're going to try to keep our current students happy and there are challenges associated with that, but we'll do our best to be sensitive to the situation."

However, some students feel that as time goes by, the construction will prove to be more of a burden than a blessing.

"I don't think I'm going to be here to see the building open, but I'll definitely have to go through all the problems it's going to bring," Del Rey said. "They say it's going to benefit the school, but we'll just have to wait until it opens to see that."

The building will be comprised of two separate room types: a four-bedroom single and a double suite, each containing a small living area, a private bathroom and a refrigerator. The four-bedroom single will also contain a kitchenette with no stove.

Besides Lakeview and the future dining area, other UP residential construction remains in the planning phase. According to Wassenaar, there are currently no plans for new residence halls at BBC.

Headline: Professor recovers from car accident, awaits new marine biology building
Author: Ivan Blanco / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Professor Christopher Brown, director for the Department of Marine Biology, is a man who likes his language dirty, his beer microbrewed and his science aquatic.

 Adorning a spot behind Brown's desk is a tank containing two angelfish of a rare breed known as Marble Lace. Grabbing a container of food and sprinkling some into the tank, Brown explains how he got into the fish business.

"I became a scientist because of an aquarium hobby I never quite got under control," said Brown. 

Directly in front of his desk is a bookshelf, which is blanketed in dust and brimming with books covering all sorts of novelty subjects. One of the books is a filthy word dictionary for the French language, appropriately titled "Merde."

The 53-year-old father of one, knows how to find humor in even the direst of situations. 

Last November, he wrapped his car around a tree. The accident left him breathing through a respirator, battling pneumonia and with several broken bones.

"Hitting a tree is not advisable," he said sarcastically. "The tree is still standing, the car is not."

Despite the severity of his injuries, he recovered in a matter of months, and is continuing  to develop the marine biology program at FIU. 

The program's inception came in Oct. of 2001, and the enrollment at that time totaled two.

"The first year was a bit slow," he said. "But at last count, we have 49 Marine Biology majors and three full-time staff members, including myself."

Adding to the program's recent growth is the construction of FIU's Marine Biology building off the Oleta River at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Groundwork began in April of last year, with Public Education Capital Outlay footing $11 million of the $13 million cost of the complex. 

The building is expected to open in August.

"If I'm not mistaken," Brown said, "this is the only time something has been ahead of schedule here at FIU ... I'm quite sure it'll be the most beautiful building on campus."

Among schools with marine biology programs, the University of Miami is widely regarded by those in the field as having the best in the nation. Still, that doesn't deter Brown.

"Let me put it this way," he said. "[UM has] some cause for concern."

Despite the possible friction of having two top-tier programs in the same city, Brown does not hold any grudges against his potential rival.

"When I had my car accident, it was Jackson Memorial Critical Care Center that saved my okole," he said.

Okole?

"It's Hawaiian. It's a more vulgar term for backside. I resided at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu for a few years, and I picked up a thing or two from the locals."

At the University of Hawaii, Brown proposed a meeting on ornamental reef fish that ultimately landed him a job writing a book on the subject.

"Editing the book took me a whole summer, but it was worth it," he said. 

His book is one of the few in the field of ornamental reef fish that deals with their scientific needs.

Aside from Hawaii, Brown has also taught at UC-Berkeley, and has spent time in the Philippines, where he worked on a seven-year project that involved the growth hormones of fish inhabiting local ponds. 

By targeting a specific hormone, IGF-1, scientists can now measure the growth of a fish more economically, accurately and efficiently than before.

"We've set up a kind of short circuit in the experimental process of determining what fish need in order to grow," Brown said excitedly. 

The new process costs a fraction of one percent of what the old methods did and shaves off months from the experimental phase.

"I never patent any of this stuff, though," he said. "It's there for all of humankind."

Brown is also finishing up a project that measures the effects of Saddam Hussein's "Scorched Earth" policy on the Gulf of Kuwait. 

In the early 90s, Hussein ordered millions of drums of oil to be dumped into the Gulf and set ablaze.

"What we do very simply is analyze larval fish," he said. "We get samples, identify them and send the data back to [the Kuwaiti government]."

In his free time, Brown enjoys traveling and undoubtedly learning dirty words from the locals. Recently, he went to China with his daughter.

"I teach a microbrewery course also," he said. "So I ordered a local brew, and they brought one out for my daughter. She's nine years old."

While in China, he bought a bust of the communist revolutionary Mao Zedong. 

The bust now resides on a shelf in his office, below a framed photograph of Brown's favorite political icon, Dan Quayle.

 "I find humor in politics," Brown said. "It's the only way to make any sense of the world around us."

Headline: Four teams fail to make the grade
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The NCAA Academic Progress Report (APR) was released on Feb. 28, causing much nationwide speculation as to the future of nationally recognized athletic programs. 

This year's report, which encompasses the 2003-04 academic year, brings new rules and standards that are sure to shake the college sports spectrum.

FIU is one of the schools that finds itself on the bubble with its four failing teams last year.  

The new calculation gives an athlete one point each semester for staying academically eligible and another point for staying in school. For example, a perfect score for a 13-member basketball team at a school with grading periods every semester would be 52 for the combined Fall and Spring semesters.

The total number of points a team actually receives is divided by the maximum possible total to get a percentage, which is converted to the 1000-point scale.

The cut line is set at 925. All teams that fall under that calculated number are in danger of losing scholarships and of other penalties.

Athletic teams do have statistical adjustments, not penalized by the NCAA, that can be incorporated into their scores if under the 925 mark. This takes care of "statistical anomalies" as put forth by the NCAA and takes into account those teams that fall below the cutline because they have a less than an average number of players. With the new rules, programs can lose scholarships for up to one year and no team can lose more than 10 percent of what it offers.

What does this mean for FIU?

The current failing programs at FIU are football, baseball, men's basketball and women's swimming. All four finished under the cut line. As a note, even though the report shows the football team with a score of 883, the corrected score is 897, which takes into account the statistical adjustment. 

Despite having four failing sports, Athletic Director Rick Mello supports the NCAA standard. 

"I am very supportive of this new standard," said Mello. "I believe [that] anything that fosters academic accountability is good for college athletics." 

The Athletic Department also pointed out that they have a stricter academic policy compared to other universities.

"Academics are taken very seriously at FIU, and because of that our eligibility standards are significantly higher than those of the NCAA, especially for freshmen," Mello said. 

Student athletics  must maintain a 2.0 GPA for eligibility to participate at FIU at the end of each semester. This includes first-semester freshmen, for which there are NCAA requirements. 

"By establishing these higher standards, we send the proper message to our students, but [we] also understood going into the APR, that it would be more difficult to reach the desired percentages," Mello said. Because the report only takes into account the 2003-04 academic year, the NCAA will not penalize any schools until the numbers are processed for the 2004-05 school year. 

In the new report, the department expects that the women's swimming team will pass because of what was not taken into account in the last report. 

Last year, the women's swimming and diving team had a number of athletes on partial scholarships just so they could field a team. The team had an overall GPA of 3.0 and every athlete was in good academic standing. 

The reason they failed, however, is because five students decided that they did not want to continue to swim competitively and one decided to return home. 

Because the report takes into account retention rate, the number of student-athletes that participate in the sport the following year, the program did not make the cut score and finished in the lowest percentile. 

All athletic departments nationwide are expected to be notified in December of this year's final results. Programs must take the penalties as early as possible. 

Schools that see penalties forthcoming from the trend shown in this report could choose to serve their punishment in the fall instead of waiting. 

Stronger sanctions, such as postseason bans for consistently poor long-term academic performance, are expected to be enforced by the fall of 2008. 

No coaches were willing to comment on the NCAA APR report.

Headline: Treaty to decrease world-wide air pollution not signed by United States
Author: German Silverio / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It has taken almost eight years for the Kyoto Protocol, a multilateral treaty requiring industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse emissions, to come into force in 2005. 

The Greenhouse effect, emissions, or gases, trap energy from the sun inside the Earth's atmosphere, to ensure the planet has a certain amount of heat. 

The problem seems to be that too many gases are being made, primarily chlorofluorocarbons, (CFCs), which are making the planet too hot. CFCs, which the Kyoto Protocol specifically targets, are gases used in aerosols, refrigerator coolants and air conditioners and are strong contributors to the greenhouse effect.

With this in mind, the Kyoto Protocol came into being, to limit and reduce worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels by 2012.  

Initially, most of the major industrialized countries were supposed to participate, but in 2001, the United States pulled out of the protocol. 

Supposedly, for the protocol to serve any effective purpose, at least 50 percent of all worldwide emissions had to be targeted for reduction. American participation would had this ensured.

Eventually, in 2004, Russia ratified the treaty. Almost 55 percent of all greenhouse emissions are now targeted for reduction, and today, only two major industrialized countries - the United States and Australia - have opted not to be part of this treaty.

One's first impression of this would be to condemn Australia and the United States for not participating in an environmental campaign of such magnitude.

In fact, the United States is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with approximately 35 percent of worldwide emissions. But, as was noted by the American government before withdrawing from the treaty, adhering to the Kyoto Protocol would cause serious consequences in an already weakened American economy, resulting in a less competitive economy in international markets. 

American companies would have to work under certain environmental guidelines which would hinder their production capacity. 

Also, the Kyoto Protocol explicitly exempts some developing countries such as China and India from decreasing their greenhouse emissions, something that President Bush and his cabinet do not see as an encouraging development. 

Economists have generally agreed that even though the protocol will be harmful for the economy in the short run, in the long run, the protocol could actually benefit the American economy. 

Here's an example from the top of my head: While today it may cost an American company $3 million to invest in more environmentally friendly technology, it may cost that same company $15 million, 20 years from now, to restructure its production means in accordance with more environmentally friendly practices. Thus that company would  $12 million in environmentally friendly technology, in which sooner or later it will have to invest.

Something else that ought to be taken into account is that the Australian and American governments have opted to stay out of the Kyoto Protocol citing over their concern of the validity of effects greenhouse emissions. Not all scientists believe global warming is the direct result of an increase in greenhouse gases. 

According to the British Broadcasting Channel, this is  because global climate change isn't a recent phenomenon, and it is natural for the Earth's climate to undergo cycles of ice ages and warm periods. 

Also, recent theories which suggest that the sun could play a larger role than greenhouse gas emissions in global warming have discredited a bit of the protocol's effectiveness. 

So, the gravity of greenhouse emissions is of a dubious nature, and is often times dismissed as irrelevant.

To be fair, with an already tarnished image and with President Bush necessitating all the political capital he can muster, his popular standing with the American people would be greatly damaged should he decide to keep the United States in the protocol. 

All those who condemn him for not supporting the Kyoto Protocol would be equally fervent in criticizing him for an even more weakened American economy. It's a tough position. Kendra Okonski for the International Policy Network best summarized president Bush's understanding of the treaty: "Kyoto is a very bad investment, because it is very costly today and only brings benefits far in the future."

Response to John Lovell's piece, "Don't mess with the DJ."

This is not a personal attack on your PR piece. It will make you happier if you understood the concept of what your hobby/profession entails: your audience's satisfaction. You work in a service industry. You are supposed to cater to the requests of your public. How dare you criticize the very same people who put food on your plate? "I hate being reminded how stupid people are," (as stated in the second paragraph, first sentence) - an individual's taste in music does not necessarily make or break his or her identity.

Being a DJ does not mean you are entitled to dictate what your audience wants to hear. There is a time and place for everything, and while you are getting paid is not the time for you to be a music Nazi. Go home and listen to songs of your personal preference on your own stereo. 

Your purpose is to keep the crowd moving and running up their tabs at the bar. In reference to your complaint about not having the specific music people request, you should be aware of similar styles of music you might have in order to please your public in attendance.

It never ceases to amaze you "how unaware people are of the genre of music that's being played." It has not ceased to amaze me how unaware you are of the environment in which you are employed.

About DJs not being jukeboxes, believe it or not, they actually are. The concept of a jukebox: Pay money to hear the song you want played. The same applies for a DJ.

I don't know your motives for being a DJ, but it seems as though you have the concepts jumbled. If you don't enjoy working with your public, why did you even enter the arena?

DOs

-Aim to please your audience, not judge them.

-Be more open-minded toward your audience. After all, you're getting paid to play their requests.

-Realize there is no real compromise. The music being played is according to the audience's desire, not the DJ's.

DON'Ts

-Don't turn down any requests. If you don't have that particular song, be prepared to play a song of similar style.

Response to Danny Muela's piece, "The Boy Without a Race."

What exactly constitutes being "Cuban"? Do you have to love pastelitos and Cuban Coffee? Do you have to be able to dance salsa? Do you even have to speak Spanish?

So many people define race as that little box that you check off when you are filling out forms. You mark off black, white or Hispanic, and you think that's it. 

You've put a stereotype in your head that Cubans are loud, late, ostentatious and proud. 

Well, granted stereotypes exist for a reason, but we are taught to look past them and not base every person in a given group upon them.

The point is that these stereotypes don't apply to everyone. I myself grew up in Broward County, so I wasn't exposed to as much of what you would consider "Cuban culture" here in South Florida. 

My Spanish is atrocious, and I take salsa classes because all of those spins and turns confuse me. But I do have a Cuban flag hanging from my car, and I happened to love Pitbull when he was "underground."

I am proud to be Cuban American no matter what. 

For me, it's not about that island 90 miles south of Key West, but my family 30 miles north. I am the person I am today because of them, and subsequently, they are who they are because of where they came from. I respect that. And even though I may never set foot on the land of my grandparents, I know that I will never need to. My "Cubanness" is defined by the pride I have in calling myself a Brito.

I think that instead of looking to stereotypes for your Cuban pride, perhaps you should try looking a bit closer to home. 

You may find that being Cuban has nothing to do with Gloria Estefan, yucca, Jose Marti, dancing or even speaking Spanish. 

You may think it's more important to know where you are going as opposed to where you're coming from. 

I worry that you may find yourself traveling in circles, looking for something that you've already seen before.

Headline: THe double standards of sex
Author: Krystian Moreno / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Some men partake in sexual promiscuity, but when a woman does the same thing, it's looked at in a negative light. Men attain social admiration and respect because of their "success" with women. However, snide remarks are made about women who are believed to be "loose." 

I can clearly remember conversations with several men on this topic. Some have even gone so far as to say, "I will only marry a virgin." I can promise you that the people who have this attitude are a few baker's dozens away from being virgins themselves. But this is the attitude and the widely accepted view on sexual promiscuity. There are serious societal forces at work that allow these flawed philosophies to remain in effect.

There are countless music videos with scantily clad women projecting these images of "party girls" into our homes and our minds. These images are a sharp contrast from those of the pure, innocent bride, walking down the aisle of a fairy tale wedding, which many have been embedded into their subconscious from a very young age.

The truth is, we laud the party girl at a party, but once the party is over, many of the same people who were singing praises now pass judgments. It's a pimp and "ho" philosophy. Perfect examples of this are artists 50 Cent, with his song "I am a P.I.M.P." and Ludacris with "You's a Ho." The irony is that a generation ago the word "pimp" would be an insult to the everyday man. Now it is used frequently and as a sort of praise. The word "ho," however, still carries the same ugly connotation it always has.

"Pop culture can affect thinking at all levels of society," said student Mike Mesa.

What upsets me the most, however, is not those who live and view life by one standard, but those who believe there are two. 

"It's part of living in a patriarchal society," said freshman Cristina Villabona. 

Society seems to place unfair pressure on women when sex is the topic. I am not a feminist, but I do believe in equality. Why should a woman be expected to remain a virgin until marriage, while we as a society egg her on to "shake it," "get loose" and let the good times roll? I believe that sex is something we all partake in, so why should someone's gender determine if something like sex is good or bad? 

This widely accepted attitude is archaic. It creates a double standard, and frankly speaking, I don't need two standards. One is just fine.

The sexual revolution of the 1960s was supposed to bring change. There have been great advances in the education, pay and rights of women, to the point where women are almost on par with their male counterparts. Parity in social and sexual acceptance however still seems unimaginable. 

We must learn to accept each other unconditionally, or we will continue to walk toward equality with our shoelaces tied together.

Subheadline: When "no" is the final answer
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
"No" is a word that no one takes easily. Whether the question is "Can I have a cookie?" or "May I work for your company?," hearing the answer no always results in a frown and a sour stomach. We are trained from the get go by parents, teachers and sports heroes that "failure is not an option." Well, sometimes it is an option- well, not so much an option as it is your tragic fate.

We have all heard the tired advice, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again." But before you get to the point of reflection and personal growth, you may feel gnawing embarrassment, burning confusion and itchy anger. 

Since drgstores don't provide an over-the-counter cream for this, here's how to deal with the varying types of rejection: 

Girls and Boys

 When it comes to matters of love, all rejection is a perverted version of this scenario: little Suzy wants Bobby to be her valentine. While everyone is making half-assed cards for each other, little Suzy is arduously using glitter and doilies to express her true feelings. When the card exchange has finished, everyone has received at least one except little Suzy. Not only that, but when she looks for Bobby and expects her love to be returned, she finds him making out by the monkey bars with little Jane. Little Jane is a little slut. Regardless, little Suzy is heartbroken. And whether this happens at 5 years old on the playground, or at 20 years old in college, it's still painful. 

 So what should the little Suzy in all of us do? One route is to slash the tires on Bobby's tricycle- or SUV. But because the joy of damaging personal property is fleeting, I guess we'll have to try dealing with our emotions. 

To say that there are plenty of fish in the sea is a gross understatement. More importantly, why would you want someone who doesn't want you? Once you remove yourself from the situation and look at it objectively, you'll realize you're being silly, and the person in question doesn't even deserve your time. If that doesn't work, there's always Voodoo.  

The job of a lifetime

You've graduated and it's finally time for you to make a name for yourself in the real world. You notice that the company of your choice is hiring and conducting interviews immediately. You buy a new suit and are looking sharp. Then, your big break comes and you finally get the job you always wanted. 

But more likely, the company tell you they're looking for someone with more experience and qualifications, and you're escorted of the premises because you look "sketchy." 

The first step toward overcoming this loss is to accept it. Be honest with yourself. Did you actually meet their qualifications? Probably not. 

The road to the perfect career is long, but on the way, you may find something you didn't know you wanted to do and may enjoy more than your original goal. Perhaps you do need two more years of school or another internship. In the end, it may be good that you explored other options. Your first choice may not always be your best choice. 

I want the "A"

While not a classic form of rejection, a bad grade on an exam can feel just as bad, especially when you don't feel you deserved it. Most professors, while they may not like to show it, are pretty reasonable. If you want to discuss your grade after class, they'd be happy to speak to you, if at least to prove there is life to them beyond lectures and note scribbling. 

Have your argument ready. Use note cards if necessary. You're not going to cause a change if your argument consists of "No fair! I'm gonna lose my scholarship! My mom and dad are gonna kill me!" Also, don't kid yourself. If the essay question was the long-term political effects of the French Revolution and you cited the cinematography in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze," then don't bother. Pray that you haven't missed the drop date.  

It's good for you 

Although it may be difficult to take at first, rejection is a part of life. It's a bitter pill that makes us stronger, more resilient and always makes us strive to become better versions of ourselves. If not, at least it gives us an excuse to learn Voodoo.

&nbsp;
1. Dan Marino
I have loved football since I was seven years old and all because of Marino. The former Dolphins QB was the best ever at his position. I recently got to meet Marino, and he is not only  a great player but a great person overall.  

2. G-Unit
From 50 Cent, Young Buck, and Lloyd Bands to Tony Yayo - they're all amazing rappers. All their beats will keep your head banging. With G-Unit clothing, shoes and albums, everything they do is G-Unitizing! GGGGGG-Unit.

3. Blondes
Can't get enough of them. Blondes are the hottest women around. My all time favorite is Britney Spears, the sexiest woman alive. I've never had a true blonde girlfriend though; I'm still searching for her.

4. Action star Steven Seagal
When you talk about action, you talk about Steven Seagal. He can kick the ass of anyone, including a 100 people at a time. With his slick lines, Japanese shirts and arm-breaking karate chops, no one can defeat the fighting master. 

5. Ribs
I've tried them everywhere in Miami. After much searching, here are my top five places to eat ribs in town: 1. Flanigan's, 2. Shorty's BBQ, 3. Tony Roma's, 4. Chevy Mex, 5. Roadhouse Grill

Headline: Scholarship opens door for FIU graduate students
Author: Damian Grass / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Krystal Anson, an undergraduate student majoring in biology, wants to be the first in her family to hold a doctorate, but like most minority students at FIU who fear that getting into a graduate school is too competitive, Anson hopes that The McNair Fellow Program will better her chances.

"It's very hard to get into a Ph.D. program," said Anson. "It is almost impossible."

Two representatives from Stanford University and Notre Dame University hoped to change that common misconception when they spoke to FIU students at the University Park campus on March 3 about the GRE exam and the importance of minority student involvement in graduate studies. 

"It's unfortunate that many minorities go out of their way to avoid the GRE and don't move on," said Joseph L. Brown, director of Student Affairs at Stanford. "I speak everywhere about ways students can prepare for it."

Many top schools throughout the nation look to The McNair Fellow Program to help encourage promising Hispanic and minority students to think beyond their bachelor's degree. 

The McNair Fellow Program, named after Dr. Ronald E. McNair, who perished on the space shuttle Challenger in 1986, helps low-income, first generation college students to earn a doctorate after their baccalaureate.  

FIU undergraduate students accepted into the program get paid to conduct original research under the guidance of a faculty mentor, have the opportunity to travel to national conferences to present their work, attend GRE preparation classes and graduate school application workshops and visit the graduate schools they wish to attend.

"We help them get into FIU's graduate program, but if they get accepted to schools like Stanford and Notre Dame, that's a good thing as well, because our job here is to help them get the best Ph.D." said Jason Scott Hamilton, associate director of the McNair Program and professor of psychology.

 It is only the second year that FIU has been part of the program, and it has already opened doors for many McNair scholars. Last year, 22 of the chosen students majoring in chemistry, engineering, biology, the sciences and mathematics were accepted to top graduate schools like FIU, Vanderbilt, Stanford and the University of Miami. 

The program has also opened doors for Eric L. Crumpler, an FIU professor for the department of biomedical engineering, who was the first person ever in the United States to get a Ph.D. as a McNair scholar. He is also a member of the faculty advisory board and review committee.This year, 22 FIU students were selected as McNair scholars and Cuban American Krystal Anson was one of them.

As part of her program, she joined with molecular microbiologist and FIU scientist, Kalai Mathee, as well as and the School of Engineering on a significant and complicated research project called, "Mold Remediation."

"Basically what we're trying to do is grow mold in the lab and then kill it by using different concentrations and seeing which one works best," explained Anson.

 "We also have planned an outreach part of our research in which we go out to the community and talk about ways to remediate mold and to prevent it from growing in their homes," she said.

The McNair Fellow Program has shed a new light on Anson's future and has provided a chance for many other minority students at FIU to pursue doctoral study something, which once seemed unachievable to many of them.

"This program's mission is to increase minorities with Ph.D.s," said Hamilton. "We are trying for these students to get a good opportunity."

Headline: Local band breaks standard mold
Author: Stefanie Perez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Ever wonder what it would be like if indie-rock and heavy metal had a baby? If they did it would be named The Kirby. 

This past week at a show at Churchill's pub, this Texas band left me disturbed, intrigued and confused all at once. As soon as the drums kicked up, a little wide-eyed man popped up on stage in black, fingerless gloves and questionably tight pants. He then proceeded to wail louder than I ever thought someone of his size was capable. 

I spent most of their 20-minute set waiting to see which guitarist would knock the other out first with their wild stage antics. Their performance was a series of catchy chorus melodies accompanied by thrusting hip movements.

Unfortunately, I cannot vouch for their lyrics. Between the incoherent vocals and the band running all over the 20-by-20 foot stage, it seemed as though everyone was performing a different song.  

While I admit that incorporating different styles into a song can make for some amazing tunes - just look at G Love and Special Sauce - this unfortunately was not the case for The Kirby.  Their style was good in theory but not in its execution.  

After listening to another nameless band roar into a microphone for another 20 minutes and throw out guitar tunes only soothing to Lucifer, the Last Gang in Town took the stage for an unmemorable performance with a bass player who couldn't have been a day older than 16 and a lead singer who wasn't a day younger than 45.

Halfway into their set, I leaned over to a stranger sitting behind me to ask the name of the band. "I'm not sure, but you should stick around for the next set," he answered.  As it turned out, his name was Derek DiGiacomo, an FIU student and the drummer for Dead Letter Post Office.  

These days most bands made up of young people have a tendency to stick to what's safe.  They throw on their washed-out jeans with a strategic tear at the knee, wear tight t-shirts with quasi-political messages and write trendy music defined by trite bands such as Good Charlotte or Simple Plan.  

This, however, was not the case with DLPO.  

Snaked of their spot twice, the band didn't hit the stage until 1 a.m., when its guitarist, Jess Scheckner, took the microphone and proceeded to curse at the preceding band.  

I couldn't help but be distracted by Scheckner restringing his guitar on stage throughout the first song, but I found this group to be a refreshing blend of the old and the new. 

Since their sound incorporated classic guitar elements, I was not surprised to learn that they were influenced by Fugazi. 

Scheckner had his guitar good and ready just in time to throw down some solid vocals for my personal favorite, the appropriately titled "A Simple Steady Rhyme." 

This song starts off in a melodic manner, then brakes into a head-nodding heavier sound. 

Next came "Mosquito" with a guitar introduction pleasantly reminiscent of an 80s love song. It concluded with Scheckner and Chris Ruppel's harmoniously singing the closing. 

Dead Letter Post Office has an easy-listening familiar sound without being cliché. For more information on DLPO, visit www.deadletterpostoffice.com.

Headline: Fun in the sun
Subheadline: daytona Beach, the perfect spring break get-away for students with small budgets
Author: Matt Santiago / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Spring break is the time to relax and hang out with friends, but most of all a time to party. Of the many places to visit, Daytona Beach probably offers the most to see and do. Floridians want more than just beaches though, so when the break rolls around, something other than just Miami Beach never hurts. 

Daytona Beach, located about an hour south of Jacksonville, is a four-hour drive on I-95.  The local shops have everything anyone needs for the beach and surfing. The famous Ron Jon's Surf Shop is located about an hour south of Daytona Beach in Cocoa Beach. For surfers, this place is your mecca ... every major surfer goes there at some point in his or her life.

  The shops are similar to those in Miami Beach, but are much less expensive. Another high point of Daytona Beach is that major clubs along Atlantic Drive are for spring breakers 18 years of age and older. The clubs, not to mention the entire area, are completely crowded with college students on break. So don't worry. You are sure to find someone out there to have fun with.

  Rates for hotels are surprisingly low ($124 a night at a Best Western), which isn't too bad if compared to other spring break locations, such as Key West, Cancun, the Bahamas or even Holiday Isle. 

One of the nicest things about Daytona Beach is its size. The center of action is located along a single major street, and just about everything from clubs and bars to shops and theaters, is walking distance from most of the major hotels. 

"It's great how close everything is, because there's no need to drive anywhere," said sophomore Brian Machado, who went to Daytona Beach last year.  

During the day the beach is about the same as Miami with one major difference- you can drive on it. If you have a high car or SUV, cruising down the beach with the windows down and a car full of friends will be something to remember.  This also makes choosing a spot and changing spots on the beach much easier. 

For those who can get to Daytona by March 18 and 19, Tuner Bash is in session and is definitely where the action is. 

The bash features "The Fast and the Furious"-style cars and products from well-known manufacturers, such as AEM, Greddy and Sparco, as well as live music and food. If you can make it, it's a really fun time with very impressive cars you won't see everyday.It's just a good way to spend the day with your friends. 

Toward the end of the week, when the crowds start to thin, the Daytona International Speedway is just a few miles away. The World Center of Racing Visitor's Center is a great place to go for the day.  The center offers guided tram tours of the facility. It also houses "The Gallery of Legends" with photographs and memorabilia of famous drivers.  

The Daytona International Speedway also hosts "Daytona USA," a state of the art interactive motor sport attraction. Visitors participate, with the help of technology, in a pit stop and design and test their own stock car.  

"After all of the college students start going home, going to the speedway is a good way to end the trip," said sophomore Eytan Benichay. "Even my girlfriend enjoys it."  

So, if you are looking for a place to go this spring break, save some money, pack some suntan lotion and make your way to Daytona Beach.
