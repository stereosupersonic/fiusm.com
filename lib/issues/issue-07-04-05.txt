Headline: Young chefs battle it out in first culinary competition
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
When Alexia Apostiadelis found out that her team had won the first ever Battle of the Iron Chef competition, she jumped up and down and screamed in fellow teammate and group leader Chris Kark's ear.

"Everything we did, we worked hard on it. All of us put all of our heart into it and we all did the best we could," Apostiadelis said.

Apostiadelis, Kark and Alvero Boom came together as Team Panther on April 3 in order to compete in a contest inspired by the Food Network's reality show, "Iron Chef." 

The event, hosted by the Hotel, Food and Travel Association, was held from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the patio of the Biscayne Bay Campus's School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.

Team Panther members received a $300 scholarship from the HM school for winning the competition, as well as a chance to compete in a cook-off.

The competition will consist of Paul Castronovo and Young Ron Brewer, radio hosts of the Big 105.9 radio station, and a professional chef who had not been named yet on May 1. 

Proceeds for this event will go towards the Save Our Strength organization, which aims to end childhood hunger in South Florida. The event will be broadcasted live on the radio and on television.

"The exposure is major due to the caliber of people [the winners] will be working with. They are trying to advance their professional careers and there is no better way to do this but with professionals in the field," said Christian Fombrun, president of HFTA and an HM major.

The members of Team Panther won the competition with their four dishes. According to Kark, the team's strategy was to "make a dish that would speak to our [cultural] roots and strengths," Kark said.

Their first dish was ceviche. It incorporated Boom's heritage, included one of the snappers, cilantro, and tropical fruit salsa. Their second consisted of a whole-grilled snapper that was cooked over an open fire, topped off with olive oil, lemon juice and served with grilled zucchini and roasted potatoes. 

Greek in its origin, the dish represented Apostiadelis's background.

The third dish was the leg of lamb that was smoked and incorporated into a risotto, representing Kark's Italian background. Roasted wild mushrooms and eggplant were added to the dish.

The last dish was a pineapple gelee, topped with a glaze mousse and pineapple salsa. The team came together as a whole to make individual components for the dish. 

According to Fombrun, HFTA's executive board, and Kevin Purdy and Joseph McKinney, both HM majors' came up with the idea for the event in December 2006. Due to the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, sponsored annually by the HM school, however, the competition was pushed back.

"We wanted to create a campus life atmosphere [for HM students] and have them be able to build relationships outside of the classroom."

All three teams had their own cooking station to work in. The only cooking utensils they were allowed to use were those they gathered half an hour before the competition and the utensils already provided at their station. 

Contestants were not allowed back in the school's kitchen once the competition started. 

The only ingredients they were allowed to use were those in their mystery baskets and in the pantry.

The teams were, however, allowed to trade food items with other teams' food items.

The panel of judges at the event were Allen Susser, an FIU alum and owner of his own restaurant, Chef Allen's; Adam Lamb, a corporate chef under IPic Entertainment; and Oliver Saucy, chef and co-owner of Darrel and Oliver's East City Grill. 

Purdy said the judges were impressed with all of the teams' dishes.

"Any one of [the judges] would have been happy to bring the dishes back to their restaurants to sell them," Purdy said.

&nbsp;
The study abroad programs offered at FIU are growing in popularity as past trips have been successful according to program directors and past participants. 

Among them, Estella Chavez, former FIU student, now works for Edelman, the biggest public relations firm in the world.

"[The trip] was amazing, fun, a cultural experience. Students should [try] out the program," Chavez said, in reference from last year's program in Germany.

Students in the advertising and public relations field can go to Germany to experience advertising and marketing in a foreign location. Those interested in poetry and creative writing can research the Creative Writing in Dublin Program with poet and professor Campbell McGrath.

The Germany 2007 trip is specifically catered to students who are majoring in advertising and public relations. Those who have a general interest in the field, but aren't majoring in that area, can simply take a set of required classes to qualify for the trip. 

While it is too late to apply for this year's trip, which will last from May 30 until June 23, interested students can sign up for next year's trip in the Advertising and Public Relations office at the Biscayne Bay Campus in Academic II, room 328A. 

Thirty spaces are available for FIU students, additionally, 14 German students will join the FIU delegation for classes in Germany. 

Jody Rafkind, director of the study abroad program to Germany said the reason the trip is full is due to the "rising popularity of the program."

"It's unique and it's not just sightseeing and field trips, but a true learning experience with real Germans, real clients, and projects, " Rafkind said. 

The students will fulfill six credits toward their major while in Germany. 

According to Rafkind, the students will stay in Berlin, they will visit top advertising and public relation agencies, such as Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate, as well as tour the city. 

The city will "offer a sense of living history around each corner with monuments, palaces, and remnants of the infamous wall all testifying to its tumultuous past," according to the Study Abroad program's website. 

All this comes at a price of $3,099, which covers airfare, transportation, hotel accommodations, some meals, tours and admissions and health insurance. 

More details on the program are available on the Advertising and Public Relations page at http://ois.fiu.edu.

Laura McDermott, assistant director to the Dublin Study abroad program, advises aspiring writers looking for a learning experience to think of Ireland, where "poetry is highly regarded and there is a holiday for the legendary artists such as James Joyce."

McGrath has now led the trip two times every two to three years,

"It is a chance to read and write poetry in a country where people care about it the most," McGrath said. 

 A total of 17 people, not required to be enrolled in FIU, will partake on the trip to Dublin, which, according to McGrath is "a fun and energetic city." 

 The trip consists of over six site visits and tours, including poetry performances, literature events and museums. Students can also take classes for college credit. 

Participants will be housed at the Trinity College in the University of Dublin. The basic cost of the trip is $3950 and payment plans are available. 

Courses are both in class and online due to time restraints, which means that all courses have online components. Among the classes offered are Introduction to Creative Writing and Poetic Techniques. They will be taught by McDermott and McGrath.  

Seminars from Irish poets such as Dennis O'Driscoll and Kerry Hardie will also be held.

All people interested can contact McGrath at (305) 546-5169 or McDermott by e-mail, info@dublinpoetry.com.

Headline: Commentary: Whips and hips mark student's taboo trip to exotic convention
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Last June, my perverted friend Kinya and I walked to the Miami Beach Convention Center on a sunny Saturday afternoon after parking at a Publix several blocks away. There was a brand new trade show starting in Miami and some of our favorite movie stars (I use the term loosely) would be in town. 

As we crossed Convention Center Drive, we noticed the predominantly male population gathered outside of the convention center - no women were in sight. Nevertheless, we were not discouraged. Kinya and I were finally here: Exxxotica 2006, one of the largest adult-themed trade shows on the East Coast. 

Standing in front of the doors of the center was the extent of our journey at Exxxotica 2006, however, because an elderly couple wearing nothing except bondage garb (handcuffs and ropes come to mind) walked past and unnerved us - we decided that this might not be our kind of crowd after all. It was clear at that point that we were not ready for this so we went to McDonald's instead. 

This year, however, I did attend Exxxotica 2007, the convention's second incarnation. Unlike last year, I knew what to expect so nothing really surprised me, but it was still an interesting and eye-opening experience. My reasoning behind going was simple: it was a different adventure and it was a story to tell my friends, even though they may never want to shake my hand ever again. 

I went with my co-worker Sergio where met up with our other co-worker Charlie. On the car ride there, Sergio called Charlie to see how the convention was - he had arrived there an hour before us. "A porn star grabbed my balls," Charlie said. We were speechless. I drove faster. 

After what seemed like an eternity, we arrived at the center and purchased our tickets. We walked inside and a scantily-clad woman handed us a plastic bag full of goodies such as condoms and more condoms. "At least they promote safe sex," Sergio said before staring at the cage dancer gyrating in front of us. 

The convention setup was basic: vendors and booths were set up all over the place - I don't think there was much of an order. Vendors and products ranged from adult video rental services to some sort of "porn glasses," a product similar to 3-D glasses, except these glasses had little screens on them so you could watch porn in private and not notice when someone walks in on you. Light-up sex toys were another highlight.

In addition to the vendors, there were various photo-op booths so attendees could take pictures with their favorite stars and make their friends jealous. One girl commented to Sergio and me about how glasses are a huge turn-on because "it's another thing to take off." She kept talking and Sergio and I just nodded until we got our picture and left. We got her autograph, too; I don't know why. 

The convention wasn't limited to sex toys and fake breasts, though. There were also various educational seminars that tackled serious topics such as "Sex Toys: The good, the bad and the battery-powered" and "The Art of Talking Dirty." Granted, I didn't attend any of these, but I'm sure someone did. 

As I said earlier, the porn convention was an eye-opening experience, mainly because I attended a Christian school most of my life where sexuality was frowned upon. My class would attend weekly chapel services where abstinence and sexual purity were emphasized. 

So when I attended the convention, it was quite surprising to see people watching porn on various screens as if it was perfectly natural. There, sexuality was accepted and actually encouraged, so I was exposed firsthand (pardon the pun) to a whole new culture, where almost anything goes.

Headline: Trivial Pursuit...a pop culture column: Internet becomes center of universe for modern consumers
Author: Reuben Periera / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
John Locke walks through the jungle like a hunter stalking his prey; following him are three "others." He crouches and reaches for the soil, examining it to find the path to take. His senses guide his party to a clearing in the jungle, where a seemingly-abandoned house stands.  No wait, now he sees that there are domesticated animals about the surrounding land. Could this possibly be a station point of one of those who they now refer to as "The Others"? 

As I watched in anticipation for the "Lost" drama to unfold, I received a message from a friend who sent me a link to information I needed while taking a test for my online class. While doing this, I also checked my mail, read the top news stories of the day and kept track of my downloaded music files.  

It should be evident by now that I was sitting in front of my computer - an electronic device that has increasingly received more attention than my television and my stereo. 

Like many others, I hardly have the time to watch my favorite television shows when they play during their prime spots and since I can't afford Tivo, the Internet is my medium of choice; the only time I get to watch the TV is when I rent my films through Netflix.com.

We've all heard that the Internet is the future, but as corny as that line may sound, the future is now. Convergence has allowed one to access all media in one place. If I wanted to find a clip of a classic moment in television history, I don't have to call the History Channel, I can watch it when I want on YouTube. For music, Last.fm and radioblogclub.com are my destinations. 

Contentwise, more television shows like "Best Week Ever" are starting to take their cues from popular themes from YouTube and MySpace clips as well. 

If I want the most comprehensive and unbiased reporting, who needs CNN or FOX, or local news when I can access BBC.com? I don't need to travel to Blockbuster to get their mediocre collection of foreign titles, I have the power of Netflix. While I won't go and buy clothes, groceries, or find my friends and relationships online, I do organize my banking transactions and pay most of my bills online as well. This year, I did my taxes completely online, too. I also took a class online and accomplished a lot more than risking a quick nap in class. 

Earlier, I described a scene from my favorite television show, "Lost". That particular episode had aired half a month ago but here I was, on my own time, watching an older episode, legally and free, in high definition on ABC's website. Like ABC, CBS has begun making its most popular shows available online. Soon, NBC and others will be following suit. Now, entire games of the NCAA are available online as well. If your cup of tea is cricket, the Cricket World Cup, currently taking place in the Caribbean, is also available all around the world.

Yes, sites like YouTube have been getting into tussles with NBC Universal and others but it's just a minor hurdle toward the inevitable. Apple understood it a long time ago and embraced the medium with iTunes. With the advent of Joost (pronounced "juiced") an online television peer-to-peer distribution network, suddenly, the power of television seems to be running low. Joost, created by the makers of Kazaa and Skype has attracted many networks such as MTV, BET, Paramount, Comedy Central, Warner Brothers and the National Geographic Channel to their channel listing and have already begun their advertising as an online television network.

 With presidential elections just a year away, 2008 nominees have already begun creating their MySpace profiles, adding songs and videos to their pages to appeal to our youthful, Internet-centered market. Becoming more than just a naughty-movie finder, the Internet is transforming the way we acquire all our media pleasures.

Headline: The Skin Crowd: Adult industry function features well-known actors, contests
Author: Christopher Necuze / Production Manager
&nbsp;
On March 30, the stars came out and the clothes came off as the second annual Exxxotica Miami adult tradeshow got underway. Held at the Miami Beach Convention Center, the three-day show featured many adult stars including the likes of well-knowns such as  Jenna Jameson, Tera Patrick and Ron Jeremy, who sat behind tables and autographed posters while posing for photos with fans. 

The convention, which carried a $25 admission price, capitalized on an industry with a worldwide revenue of more than $90 billion. According to information compiled by TopTenReviews.com from sources such as Associated Press and PornStudies, revenue for the U.S. pornography industry reached approximately $13 billion; this total includes video sales and rentals, novelties, magazines, internet, phone sex and exotic dance clubs. Adults aged 18-24 account for 14% of Internet porn users. 

Present at Exxxotica 2007 were various merchants selling everything from adult DVDs and erotic toys of all types to whips, chains and all-inclusive Caribbean vacations where even the sex is included. 

In addition to plenty of stars and merchandise, many of the adult industry's finest were on hand to give a multitude of recurring seminars including "Swinging 101," "Fetish 101," "Sex Toys, Amateurs Turn Pro" and "Tying the Knot: Sensual Bondage."

Attending the "Amateurs Turn Pro" seminar was Michelle Lloyd, 25, who was in town vacationing with her boyfriend.

"These folks really know what they're doing," Lloyd said with a laugh. "We've tried to make our own videos at home and were just interested in suggestions. Not interested in going pro, though." 

On the convention's center stage, stars and show attendees alike participated in a variety of contests and demonstrations that made several audience members gasp. Attendees were able to vote in the annual Ms. Exxxotica competition, found out everything they wanted to know about porn but were afraid to ask and were witness to a fashion show hot enough to bear the Hustler name.

No contest, however, produced more gasps than the Screaming "O" Contest in which audience members were invited onstage to show off just how loud their orgasms could get.

Edith Velasco, 38, attended Exxxotica last year and has been waiting ever since for her chance to go again. Velasco was looking forward to the question and answer session with the entertainers. 

"I've always wondered to myself how they can last so long," Velasco said while blushing. "I never thought I'd get a chance to ask. Being here makes you realize that even porn stars are just regular people."

Junior Suzanna Dawson, who attended the convention with her boyfriend Senior Nivv Oudit, was particularly impressed by the stars' social personalities.

"It was really awesome seeing everyone just acting like normal people," she said. "You see the actors and actresses in the movies, when you meet them, they're just so down to earth - it's refreshing."

In an interview with AVN.com, J. Handy, director of Victory Tradeshow Management, the producer of the event, explained the reasoning behind the event's creation.

"We saw a hole in the market," Handy said. "Nobody was producing an adult event of this size on the East Coast."

Exxxotica debuted in 2006 and, if estimates are correct, attracted more than 16,000 guests in its first year. Show coordinators decided to move the event from June to March in order to cater to the large influx of tourists in town for Spring Break. Attendance was expected to surpass 20,000 for the three-day long show.

Headline: Historic airport tower may be torn down
Author: Christina Veiga / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For Butler Waugh, it's all about remembering where you came from-he just hopes that Florida International University feels the same.

One of the original founders of FIU, Waugh remembers "thinking up" the new university in an airport control tower that hasn't changed much: it stands old and abandoned now, just as it did in 1969.  

 "When we moved in, there was no furniture. We sat down on overturned waste baskets and we just started to talk-and we talked up a university. The reason why the tower is important is because that's where it all started," he said.

But according to the final draft of a Facility Program Document released Feb. 27 by Facilities Management, a new Public Safety building may be taking the place of the historic Tower, located behind the Ryder Business Building at University Park. 

Public Safety was housed in the tower until December of last year. The department had to move out of the building due to health concerns after traces of asbestos were found. The facility had numerous problems, including a bee infestation where 80 pounds of honey were removed from the Tower's walls. Growing, and with no building of their own, Public Safety is in need of a new facility. 

"We outgrew the original building probably about 10 years ago. The previous two Chiefs tried diligently to acquire a new facility for us, but I guess we weren't a priority for the University, so we were always left out," said Lt. Frank Tomassini, newly appointed Public Information Officer. 

According to Bill King, Chief of Public Safety, plans for a new police station have been in the works for about five years now. King says that although the plans are still not final, the new Public Safety facility may be constructed behind the current Duplicating Center building.  

"I haven't been a part of any of the discussions of what would happen to the Tower," said King.

The plans released by Facilities Management state the new location to be "adjacent to and North of the Duplicating Center". They also state that the new building will be built "on an existing structure".  

Bruce Hauptli, Faculty Senate chairperson, interprets the building plans to also include tearing down the tower.

"My guess is that it's not just rumor, that the tower is coming down" Hauptli said.  

However, Victor Citarella, associate vice president for Facilities Management, stated in an e-mail, "There are no current plans to demolish the existing "tower building" that we [Facilities Management] are aware of at this time".

Citarella also denied the existence of any plans for the new Public Safety building. 

"There are no construction plans developed yet for the new Police Headquarters building, in fact, the final draft of the building program was just completed. No design drawings have been prepared at this time" he wrote.

Plans for a new facility are unclear, admits Tomassini. 

"We're wondering why it has been such a mystery. In all actuality we don't know where our building is going to be, or how big it is going to be, or when it is going to be built," Tomassini said. 

In an interview held March 6, Hauptli originally suggested that construction for the new building would begin soon. In a second interview held March 9, Hauptli stated that he was misinformed, and that construction was not likely to begin immediately.

He admits that it would be the first time that construction does not begin soon after the release of the final draft of a building plan. Hauptli claims the delay to be due to insufficient funds, and uncertainty as to the final location for the building. 

Ultimately, the future of the tower rests in the hands of the President's Office. According to Citarella, Facilities Management will make a suggestion to the University's Executive Committee, who then make the final decision. The whole process takes about two years said Citarella.  

With the future of the Tower uncertain, Waugh doesn't want to see the building go. 

"I think it would be wise to maintain the old airport tower as a relic of the old days, so people can realize that was all we got," Waugh said.

There was no air conditioning, potable water, telephone or filing cabinets when FIU's four founders moved into the tower in September of 1969. The little furniture that founding President Charles "Chuck" Perry, Waugh, Donald McDowell, and Nicholas Sileo had was borrowed from Florida Atlantic University, or made out of cardboard boxes, garbage cans, and old crates. According to Beyond the Tower: The History of Florida International University by Tom Riley, the founders had little to work with, but they were determined to build the first public university in Dade County. By 1972, they did just that, Waugh said. 

"I knew you could make a university anyplace, all you needed was teachers and students," Waugh said, referring to FIU's humble beginnings in the airport control tower. 

But with few of the founding members still around, Riley doesn't doubt that the tower will one day be torn down.

"It took a long time to get us out of there, and now they can do what they want to do," Riley said, and added that FIU President Modesto Maidique promised Perry that the tower would be preserved. 

The President's Office was not available for comment.

According to Riley, the tower was so important to Perry that he was laid to rest near it when he passed away. 

Perry died in August 1999 due to cancer at the age of 62. A memorial plate was placed nearby the tower.

"Chuck Perry still wanted to be around the tower. Why don't they just take his body out because that's probably going to get in their way in a few years," Riley said.

Headline: Administrator manages finances, staff, keeps a smile
Author: Cristela Guerra / BBC Managing Editor
&nbsp;
From the top of the Primera Casa Building at FIU, Vivian Sanchez directs her staff as a conductor directs an orchestra, each part just as essential to develop and heighten the melody.

This is an aspect of FIU most students wouldn't be exposed to. But this is strategy that the 41-year-old Sanchez, chief financial officer and senior vice president employs daily.

Sanchez is a walking ball of energy. Always in motion, the colorful suit of a corporate executive working at the public university, weaves in and out of meetings with one of her direct reports, a hands-on method of managing that some might find rare for a CFO, but she sees as taking ownership of what she manages.

This morning, like so many others, she greets each person that passes, from the janitorial staff to the president of FIU's Board of Directors, some fellow Harvard business school graduate like herself, with the same hello, same warm smile, and ubiquitous cup of coffee.

A moment alone is rare in the life of a CFO. 

Her office connects her directly to the president of the University as well as the provost. Under her management are 13 direct reports from all different areas of FIU's life: from parking and traffic to the emerging College of Medicine to advising the president. She oversees 1,000 or more employees.

Yet for all this she maintains a low-key profile, keeping herself out of the spotlight and her job under the radar.

Her office decor is minimalist: two paintings, a myriad photos of her nephew/godson on one side of a dark wooden desk at the longer end of a table and sunlight sparkling off two large bluish purple beta fish near the pictures. They swim in circles while eying each other suspiciously from their side of the plastic tank that divides them. In the middle of the office sits a long dark wood table, where it is often occupied.

Papers, portfolios and folders stack themselves on her desk, a never-ending statement to what her job entails. A Leader's Legacy, Asi hablaba Cuba and other books line her one bookshelf.

Though her office decoration does not capture her personality, it gives insight into the private Vivian Sanchez, the ambassador to the arts who enjoys spending time with the family and the outdoors.

What truly captures the senses, however, is the view from her office, where a balcony overlooks FIU's central quad. You can see Miami spread out endlessly from here, almost as though the city had no horizons. This imagery is appropriate for Sanchez - she describes herself as someone looking out to the distant goal, not minding the obstacles lining the way.

According to University President Modesto A. Maidique, this is why he hired her.

"It is a real pleasure to work with someone that is as dedicated, as energetic and as intelligent as Vivian. She helps bring clarity to my ideas, takes tremendous initiative on her own and fixes problems before I even knew they existed," Maidique said.

Sanchez works with the president following the early morning Board of Director's meeting on a leadership presentation. Light green eyes peruse the screen and glance back and forth as she types on the laptop in the president's well-lit, high-ceiling office. The president and Sanchez play off of each other's ideas in something she calls "mutual dependence."

"He gives me an idea, and I play with it, and he leaves and comes back and says `I like it!'" said Sanchez with a laugh. 

In her opinion, the essential aspect of the relationship between the president, the provost and the CFO only work if they are all on the same page.

"We all trust each other to know none of the three will undermine the other," Sanchez said. "If someone goes off, it destabilizes what we have to do … If the provost is focusing on academics and I'm working on the infrastructure and hiring people and working with facilities and neither know what the others doing, it doesn't work."

Her employees, such as Assistant Director of University Operations Sandra Fernandez are well aware that when she enters the room they should prepare a pen, paper and notes of new appointments, calls, meetings, lunches and the occasional joke or two.

"You learn a lot. She challenges you and is incredibly bright and very dynamic," Fernandez said. "You gotta be quick - she is one of the most interesting individuals I've worked for."

A chief financial officer cannot be without a sense of humor. Sanchez's statements are a mix of sarcasm and deadpan humor - you're not always sure except for the smirk on her face.

"I was stressed last week because I had something I needed to work on, but since my door is right there at the front, everybody comes into my office; it's one stream of interruptions," Fernandez said. "So Vivian saw me freaking out, closed my door and put one of the large plants outside my door and I was able to get my work done."

Sanchez herself admits a key to success is "not believing one's own story" and rather defining oneself by something greater than one's job.

 "I've always kept grounded in who I am and where I came from because of these various fundamental values I was raised," she said. "When I see people fall is because they believe their story so much they don't define themselves by anything else."

A self-proclaimed Westchester girl, Sanchez grew up right around the corner from FIU, when the area consisted of strawberry fields and horse patches and FIU was a strip for airplanes rather than student life.

Her parents, both Cuban, were married in Miami where they bought the house where she was raised in 1960. They've lived in the same house for the last 47 years. 

"I played sports, a lot of sports … To keep up with your brother you gotta do everything. Little bit of a high-energy child, softball, basketball and … tournament tennis," Sanchez said.

Admitting these sports were good for getting all her energy and emotion under control, Sanchez said.

"I have always been this way," she said with a laugh. "Sports were a good way to get out all that energy."

As a young woman, she attended St. Brendan's from kindergarten all the way to 12th grade. Her dream: to attend Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.

"I was really lucky, because I came from a family with parents who always instilled in me I could do anything I wanted to do," Sanchez said. 

After almost 20 years experience in the business market, with a stint at Harvard Business School as well as working for five years as CFO of Visa Latin America, Sanchez never pictured herself in finance, let alone business.

At Georgetown, she specialized in international trade with emerging markets, a degree that benefited her later in finance on Wall Street and then in the Harvard Business School. She later worked with companies consulting governments in Eastern Europe following the fall of the Iron Curtain and in Latin America.

"Obviously this is not the career path most MBA's took, working with governments to make companies viable and sell them off to strategic investors. So, I walk in, and you have this plant that produces kitchen cabinets, you have an integrated economy … and try and understand what it had the capability of doing and what it could do in the future," Sanchez said.

With one bite of the restructuring bug, Sanchez eventually found herself on the road to FIU.

She worked with many emerging markets, which included a move to Lima, Peru, to implement theories she had on turning a mom-and-pop company into a multi-national corporation. She later worked at Visa Latin America, only expecting to stay two years.  She stayed five.

"In comparison to before, now I was responsible for my day to day actions and day to day decisions for managing a lot of people and living with the consequences of the decisions I made," Sanchez said. "When you do that enough, and boy you screw up the first time, you learn a lot, but now you live with them on a day to day basis, not just the people who want you to succeed but the people who don't want you to succeed."

Eventually in light of a new president's administration, a new management team and vision was brought in, and she, among others, was let go. Sanchez admits it was a difficult time, but one that she's put in perspective.

"It was such a learning experience for me because I had put so much of my life and so much of my person into the organization believing in the vision. And someone had dropped in saying, 'Thanks but you're no longer required to be a part of the team," she said.

Nevertheless, the depth and personal growth gained landed her on the steps of FIU and to a new restructuring project two and a half years ago.

Sanchez's energy and zeal for her profession is practically tangible, though according to her it's the social consciousness in her that always keeps her striving to "have an impact and do something good for society."

As she sits up in her fifth floor office, making decisions that affect the entire University and drinking at most seven cups of coffee a day, it's doing good for the sake of doing something good and living for the sake of enjoying life that makes her enjoy her job all the more.

"Ultimately, I want to sit back in my rocking chair when I'm 80, a kid from Westchester and ask, 'What did I do?'" Sanchez said.

Headline: Scholarships should not be taken away
Author: Joy Clahar / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Carmelda Labaze is a successful pre-med student and resident assistant here at FIU. She is also a recepient of the Bright Futures Scholarship award, which is one of the reasons she is attending the University.

"Bright Futures is what kept me in a Florida public university,"  Labaze said. "Otherwise I would have gone to … an ivy-league school," Labaze said.  

Young universities are aware of the fact that merit-based scholarships, like those funded by the Bright Futures Scholarship Program, help to retain the best and the brightest students within a state. Even FIU uses this tactic; it devoted $64.9 million for combined need and merit based scholarships in the 2005-06 school year. The difference is that the University had to set aside funds from its own budget to provide those scholarships, while Bright Futures is funded by the Florida Lottery.

So why would Howard Rock, a member of the FIU Faculty Senate, tell The Beacon that Bright Futures is a "middle to higher middle-class entitlement" for "students who don't need it?"

As it stands, financial need is determined based on the information a student provides on their Free Application for Federal Student Aid form. For most, parents' income is the primary factor that the government takes into consideration when calculating the Expected Family Contribution.  Those who demonstrate financial need by this method are granted aid such as Federal Work Study, Pell Grants and institutional aid. A student whose EFC is greater than or equal to their cost of attendance is considered to have little financial need.

But the FAFSA should not be the only tool used to determine financial need.

Cultural differences are a key component being left out of the equation. The assumption is that all middle-class parents should be footing the bill for their child's college education. Miami-Dade county supplies the majority of the student body of FIU and is composed largely of immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean. 	

As such, many students are first-generation citizens whose parents have not taken the traditional path to higher education in America.  These families may not share the same views on borrowing for college or even understand the steps that should be taken while in high school to prepare academically and financially for college. Although the FAFSA considers many first-generation U.S. students for categorical scholarships, they are not available to all of them.

It is these students who are most likely to remain in Florida during their undergraduate years and most likely to end up left behind where education is concerned.

For many families, the EFC calculated from FAFSA information is unreasonable. This has much to do with the fact that family debt and credit scores are another critical factor not taken into consideration.

The Florida Bright Futures Scholarship program is more of a blessing than a curse. It provides opportunities to a broad spectrum of students who performed well in Florida high schools, including some who might have otherwise ended up in financial aid limbo. 

In addition, the program results in a healthy competition among Florida colleges and universities that is beneficial to all of our state's future graduates.

The real problem with the senator's statements is that the Bright Futures Scholarship Program claims to provide merit-based scholarships. These scholarships are not handed out haphazardly as Rock seems to imply.  

The Florida Academic Scholars Award, the full-tuition scholarship funded by the program, requires that students earn a 3.5 weighted high school grade point average, a competitive SAT or ACT score, and complete a minimum of 75 community service hours. It may be that Miami-Dade county public schools and others in the state and nation fail to make these requirements enough of a challenge.

If anything, that means that public schools need to improve their academic rigor, not that the Bright Futures Program, should be done away with.

The 30 percent of FIU students who are helped by the Bright Futures are more than just statistics; each of them is one more person who has the opportunity to build a better foundation for the future of themselves and their families.

Taking that opportunity away would not be the solution to any problem.

Headline: Editorial: Historic air-traffic control tower should be preserved
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
FIU is a relatively young academic institution. As far as tradition is concerned, FIU is largely bereft of the history that older universities possess. 

Building traditions and developing the historical depth that enriches the culture of an educational establishment is a process that often spans decades. 

Members of the Student Government Association as well as many professors, students and faculty have stressed the importance of creating these traditions, which they say will play a vital part in forming FIU's identity.

Yet when it comes to the air-traffic control tower behind the Ryder Business building, the oldest structure on campus, many of these same individuals see no problem with tearing it down.

According to Butler Waugh, one of the founders of FIU, the very idea to create Miami-Dade county's first public university originated in the tower. It is, in  essence, the birthplace of what we know today as "Florida International University."

Before the very first class was held, before Golden Panthers roamed the halls and walkways of University Park, all that stood was a group of ambitious individuals and a tower.

Now this building, arguably the most historically significant edifice on either campus of FIU, is in danger of being destroyed to make room for a new Public Safety building.

Now, the tower is far from perfect. It's old. It's not the most aesthetically pleasing building on campus. The structure has been plagued with problems from bee infestation to asbestos. Ironically, these problems were found when the tower was used as the Public Safety building.

Yet the many imperfections of an old structure are hardly justifiable reasons for its destruction, especially in the case of such a historic landmark.

The building has been repaired to some degree, and its significance has only grown with the passage of time.

As Miami-Dade's first public University, and as a school that aspires to become a widely respected institution of higher education, we cannot discard what little history we have. We cannot choose our traditions, and although the tower is far from perfect, it should continue to stand as testament to the will and ingenuity of those who built this school out of an abandoned airport.

There have been mixed reactions from administrators in regards to the future of this relic. We hope that they confront the issue and take an active role in protecting this landmark.

Moreover, the plans for the building that would take the tower's place have yet to be drawn, and funding has yet to be secured by FIU for its construction. The tower's fate is far from sealed, and those in favor of its preservation still have time to act.

Those who recognize the necessity for the protection of the structure that served as the foundation of this University,  must speak up now.

Testing service reverses GRE changes 

In a surprise decision to students and staff, the Graduate Record Exam won't be changing at all this Fall. 

Educational Testing Service, the company responsible for administering the GRE, announced April 2 that it has canceled plans to begin the new test version of the exam.

The proposed changes had included a test length increase from 2 ½ hours to 4 hours, a cutback on test administrations from nearly every day of the year to only about 35 days per year and a focus on higher cognitive and reasoning skills.  

The changes were scheduled to take place in September.

ETS had been planning these changes for nearly two years, claiming that the new GRE would be a better predictor of initial student success in graduate school. 

The GRE is required for admissions to many graduate school programs.

Headline: Triathlon raises money for diabetes foundation
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It was a cool breezy morning and the sun had just risen. Everyone stood by, anxiously waiting for someone to say it was okay to start.

An air horn blared and everyone ran in.

At 7 a.m., 35 individuals walked down a hill and dove head first into the cold waters of a lake located in the middle of C.B. Smith Park located in Pembroke Pines.

On April 1, Sigma Phi Epsilon held their first annual Tri-Fit Challenge to help raise money to support the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Following the triathlon, Agustin Barbara, the race director of the Tri-Fit Challenge, presented a $4,500 check to Ingrid Velarde of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

Barbara first came up with the event after witnessing his grandfather, Roberto, battle diabetes. 

"I've seen him throughout the year be affected by diabetes and I thought this would be the perfect event. It's hard to see someone you care so much about go through that," Barbara said. "The whole purpose of this project was to raise community awareness."

Of the 35 individuals who participated, 10 were FIU students.

Participants swam .25 miles, then biked five miles around the park and capped off the event with a two-mile run.

"I'm just a swimmer, this is my first time doing anything like this," said Santiago Pazos, a personal attorney who finished with a triathlon-best time of 33:25. "Anything that involves sports and is for a good cause, I'm all for." 

The age of those participating in the triathlon ranged from 17 to 54 years of age with everyone finishing the event under an hour.

"It was such an adrenaline rush in the beginning, but the swimming part was definitely the hardest," said sophomore Laura Davis, whose mother has battled diabetes for most of her life. "She's had juvenile diabetes her whole life. It felt really good to participate in an event like this. I always try to participate in things that help diabetes."

According to the JDRF, more than 1 million Americans have juvenile (type 1) diabetes and every hour, someone in the United States is diagnosed with juvenile diabetes.

The JDRF says that juvenile diabetes causes a person's pancreas to produce little or no insulin, a hormone necessary to sustain life.

Sophomore Kallie Burke, who helped organize the event, knows the effects juvenile diabetes can have one's life.

Her uncle, Johnny Nichols, was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 19 years-old and recently past away due to diabetes and other health problems.

Burke's cousin, Ellie Fellbaun, and father, Brad, have also been diagnosed with diabetes.

Burke said that she remembers Fellbaun being pricked by needles to measure her blood sugar levels since she was 9 months old.

"Diabetes is close to my heart. I've had several family members who have dealt with this for their entire lives. It's hard. I worry that my children are going to have it," Burke said.

Headline: Men's baseball overpowered by offensive barrage
Author: Claude Phanor / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers (16-15) had their hands full against No. 28 University of Louisiana-Lafayette (23-6) March 30-April 1 at University Park Stadium. The Ragin' Cajuns boasted a 22-5 record coming into the series against FIU.

ULL entered the series riding a six-game winning streak against the Golden Panthers. FIU also became the latest victims to lose a series against the Ragin' Cajuns. Just recently, ULL swept McNeese State in two home and away series. The Ragin' Cajuns defeated Florida Atlantic and Louisiana Tech at home, before taking the series 2-1 from the Golden Panthers.


ULL 10, FIU 3
The Golden Panthers held ground against the Cajuns for about seven innings, maintaining a tie score of 3-3. It was anything but a pitcher's duel as junior Chris Allen went up against right-handed junior pitcher Buddy Glass of the Cajuns. Offense was plentiful as both pitchers gave up a total of 16 hits (Allen nine and Glass seven) through seven innings of work. ULL junior outfielder Nolan Gisclair broke the tie with three-run home run in the top of the seventh inning. Gisclair led all hitters, going 3-for-4 with four RBI. ULL catchers Jonathan Lucroy and Scott Hawkins contributed to the rest of the scoring in the bottom of the ninth inning. Lucroy's two RBI double and Hawkins' two run home run added four runs of insurance to seal
the deal for the Cajuns. 

ULL 19, FIU 5
The Golden Panthers' pitching struggles continued in the second game of the series, as the staff gave up a season-high 22 hits. The defense was absent for the Golden Panthers.

"We're not playing very well as a team, we're not picking each other up," coach Danny Price said.

Freshman Corey Polizzano pitched four and one-third innings, giving up seven earned runs before getting taken out for right-handed freshman Brian Santana.

"[Polizzano] started well but then the wheels fell off," Price said.

Neither Santana nor Kyle Preshong fared any better versus ULL offense as Lucroy and Hatfield combined for 12 of ULL's 16 RBI for the game. Lucroy hit two home runs while his teammate went on to hit three home runs.

"Everything we tried just didn't work," Price said.

With the score at 7-2 in favor of ULL in the bottom of the fifth inning, the Golden Panthers capitalized off a couple of wild pitches with runners in scoring position to drive in four runs to reduce the deficit to 7-5. The Golden Panthers comeback attempt in the bottom of the fifth wasn't enough.

The Ragin' Cajuns responded by tacking on nine more runs in the sixth and seventh inning.

"We were in it until the fifth inning. We came back, but then the momentum shifted," Price said. "Twelve runs were scored on two outs; we just can't have that. Our guys have to want to win."


FIU 14, ULL 13
Despite the Golden Panthers' six errors, they narrowly escaped a high scoring affair behind senior pitcher Walker Whitely, who gave up four earned runs, struck out eight and walked one batter in four innings of work.

"We kept putting ourselves in bad situations. We were fortunate to get the precious out when we got it," Price said.
Whitley was able to get Lucroy, who scored six runs and recorded four hits in the series, to strike out
three times. "I try to get my fastball to sink. If there's a strikeout, it's strikeout, but I'm pitching for groundballs," Whitley said.

Rarely does a team win when it commits six errors, but the Golden Panthers' worst defensive performance
of the season did not detract them from winning.

"We are not going to win making six errors; even I made one myself. We just can't have that especially in close games like this one," said junior first baseman John Petika.

Although Whitley and the defense were able to hold the Cajuns' highpowered offense at bay for some time, it was the Golden Panthers offense that helped slug them to victory.

Trailing 8-2 in the bottom of the fifth inning, the Golden Panthers' offense exploded, scoring nine runs off of eight hits. James McOwen, Corey Lozano and Bryan Pullin led the Golden Panthers' offensive surge by driving in two runs apiece each and combining for 10 hits.

"We know we got a good offense and you could only score so many runs a game," John Petika said.

FOOTBALL
The football team played its first scrimmage March 31 at FIU Stadium. The defense showed the same promise from last year as it recorded 16 sacks and an interception.

Sophomore quarterback Paul McCall ran the offense and completed 10-of-15 passes for 49 yards.

Redshirt-freshman John Paul Fraites completed 7-of-9 passes for 65 yards. The running game consisted of junior running backs Julian Reams and A'mod Ned rushing for 25 and 17 yards, respectively.

Although the quarterbacks were accurate, the offense failed to score an offensive touchdown.

The new recruits who signed in February were in attendance and will be fighting for a position on the team this summer.


SOFTBALL
The softball team (14-26, 2-7) lost two of  three games to the North Texas Mean Green (15-23, 7-5) March 31 and April 1 in Denton, Texas.

During the first game of the series starting pitcher Kerri Houck allowed eight runs in six innings of work. Senior catcher Tabitha Embry's two run home run gave the Golden Panthers their first lead of the game in the top of the third.

The Mean Green responded by scoring seven of its eight runs in the bottom of the third inning and defeated the Golden Panthers 8-2.

Game two of the series offered a different outcome as the Golden Panthers won their only game of the series, 6-4.  Penny Eastman pitched a complete game while allowing four runs and striking out six.

The seesaw battle was stabilized by Monique White's solo home run to tie the game at 4-4. Outfielder Kim Rodriguez's two run home run in the top of the seventh inning won the game.

The rubber match of the series proved to be a disaster for the Golden Panthers. They lost control of the game towards the latter innings and fell to the Mean Green 6-5. All six Mean Green runs were scored in the
final two innings of the contest, including four in the bottom of the final inning. FIU held a firm 5-0 advantage heading to the top of the fifth before imploding in the bottom of the sixth and seventh due to lack of control from the pitchers.

The Mean Green recorded one hit, but scored four runs in the final inning and won on a bases loaded walk to junior outfielder Lauren Bergstrom.


GOLF
The women's golf team finished in sixth place out of 12 schools at the 37th Annual Ryder/Florida's Women's collegiate Golf Championships at Don Shula's Golf Club and Resort in Miami Lakes April 1.

Sophomore Susan Nam led the way by finishing tied for 11th place with a 15-over 231.
