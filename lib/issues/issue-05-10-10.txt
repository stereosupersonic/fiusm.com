Women, Gender, Pressure, Guilt, and Body-Image
My opinion


	In the moment of truth we must succumb to our gender, the differences we can make, and how our gender has made us who we are as women and our identity of who we are today. Past affects of gender, class differences, and the generations of many, have surfaced to present life. Gender has implicated its importance upon body image, mental health, and the roles that we lead as females. Stigmas are consistently present, such as perfection. The stereotypes that pertain to being a female leader inside and outside of the class room can lead to great pressure and misperceived self-expectations no matter what class or ethnicity.
	Eating disorders are at a high, especially among young girls, and women students. Many young women today reflect a large percentage of the population of students in college. Studies suggest that white-middle and upper-class girls appear to be most vulnerable to stress that is produced by normative definitions of mature femininity and the need for perfection, more so than any other ethnicity or of the male gender. 
	Many factors apparently contribute to body dissatisfaction among adolescent girls. One study found that being overweight, perceived pressure to be thin, internalization of thin ideal, and lack of social support predicted body dissatisfaction in adolescent girls" This research was performed by Stice & Whitenton in 2002.
This is concerning and disturbing, considering that this is referenced in a 2002 study and it seems to become more alarming with influence throughout the years and generations. A "fat spurt" is described as the time that girls experience a rapid gain in fat and height around puberty. Their average weight gain is twenty-four pounds

	Twenty-one year old and F.I.U. student, Lacey Anderson speaks of her 	adolescence and being a young girl and a woman today, "The girls of seventh 		grade continued to look like little girls. I was embarrassed and ashamed. I realized 	that I was slowly getting larger in the size of my jeans. My hips were rounding, 		my breasts were rounding, and the boys were noticing. The boys were not 		impressed with this sudden change. They were mocking, teasing, and cruel. I 		began to diet. Puberty had become my private hell. I still struggle with that little 	girl today".
	 
	 "Adolescent girls are often harassed while other people watch. Teacher and 	school officials often downplay the significance of sexual harassment among 	students. They often stand by while girls are harassed in front of them in 	classrooms" says Psychologist Stein, "leaving women quieted, depressed, and 	with lost self-esteem. Women in college are constantly demeaned and harassed"

	Ethnicity can play a huge role within normative comparisons. It appears that African-American women are not as critical of their bodies or of their body images, as often as White-American women.  According to researchers, Crawford and Unger, the consistent and universal representations of women and men as different genders help to generate biases. Women always feel more pressure for perfection and men make this easy for women to feel, just as much as other women can discriminate against one another. 	
		
	According to an African-American female student Leslie Sheilds, a recent student 	attending Florida International University at North Campus, "I am very proud of 	my body and my African curves. It is what my mother and my heritage gave 	me. I don't feel the need to starve myself or if I make an unexpected grade, 	I'm going to make myself puke in order to feel better or in control"
	
	White-middle and upper-class girls are more likely affected by school, the pressure for perfect grades, and are more likely to suffer from eating disorders than any other ethnicity or other social class. They have found that this is all interrelated. In reference to a study conducted by Regnerus & Cox in 2001 that involved more than 3,500 students in seventh through twelfth grades, pubertal growth was linked to having perceptions of being overweight by both sexes. In contrast, this growth had a greater effect on girl's perceptions of being overweight then the boys. 	
	Senior and communications major, Courtney Leigh says, "My adolescence was 	difficult. Today is difficult. I began to recognize an intergenerational role emerge 	within the gender differences among our family.  Males placed precedence over 	the females in our family. My sister, my mother, and myself, had poor body 	images, and my mother eventually found the loneliness and resentment of being a 	stay at home "housewife" and mother. Her anger emerged toward my father's 	sudden found success in his career and her perception that his job had now 	become more important than she was. She discovered diet pills, I was still 	struggling with bulimia, my sister was struggling with weight gain, and my 	brother was struggling with basketball." 

		Girls that mature early, those that reach menarche before the ages of eleven-and-a half have the highest rate of depressive symptoms", "Many factors apparently contribute to body dissatisfaction among adolescent girls. One study found that being overweight, perceived pressure to be thin, internalization of thin ideal, and lack of social support predicted body dissatisfaction in adolescent girls"  quoted by Stice in 2002.This is concernedly disturbing
considering that this is referenced in a 2002 study and I embraced such influential experiences in 1980.
	Student Kristen Curns, of South Campus says, "I always wanted to be like the rest 	of the girls they all looked anorexic, small, and cute. Just look at the magazines."

	In 1995 a survey was conducted of ninth- through- twelfth- grade students. 34% of girls perceive themselves as overweight (Phillips, 1998). Sixty percent of girls were dieting in1997.In Chapter Seven of Women and Gender (Crawford and Unger, 2004,) it is stated that eating disorders have the highest mortality rate, 10% among all types of psychiatric disorders (Phillips, 1998, pp. 220). Sadly, today's young women face more pressure than I encountered and it seems to be evolving and perpetuating into harsher standards.
	We have seen that gender and role are intertwined. Roles conferring authority and power are played by men while women occupy subordinate positions. There is much evidence proving that overweight woman are much more severely stigmatized then are men. Overweight woman earn less money and are less likely to be supported for college from parents.
	Women should learn to understand their bodies, the changes that they go through, and the encouragement of achievements other than body-image. We need to educate that it is safe to be healthy and happy with who we are and to feel strong and proud of whom we are. We need to not place so much emphasis on thinness, food, and external beauty, but much more on awareness. Emphasizing awareness in our own roles as women, what we should teach our children, and the generations to come.
	Stereotyping is necessary, but we have to be aware of the stigmatizations and discriminations that they carry.  Women need to support each another as a gender; we need to recognize the roles of our gender, and what they mean in our lives. We must encourage growth within ourselves and among other women and young girls. Teaching that the way we look, who we are, the different roles we play,  and the subsets we have institutionalized into our lives such as, a mother, wife, house-wife, stay-at home-mother, professional, career woman, of upper or lower class, of ethnicity, heterosexual, homosexual, thin, overweight, full-breasted, small-breasted; a few to mention, should  not carry guilt or shame.

Headline: Was ID an ET?
Subheadline:  
Author: m.klarfeld@att.net
&nbsp;
Was I.D. an E.T.?
THE CASE OF THE "INTELLIGENT DESIGNER"
In March 1925 the Tennessee legislature outlawed the teaching of any doctrine denying the divine creation of Man as taught by the Bible.  In July of that same year, John T. Scopes, a high school teacher, was brought to trial for teaching Evolution in violation of the state law.   The ensuing Scopes Trial (or, deridedly, the "Monkey TriaI") drew worldwide attention to the seemingly irreconcilable conflict between Creationism (the old fashioned belief in the biblical account) and Evolution (based on Darwin's findings of Natural Selection).
John Scopes was found guilty and was fined $100; the Tennessee law was repealed in 1967; but the debate has not ended: Is Man, Homo sapiens, solely the product of a long process of natural selection ("Evolution"), or the result of a divine decision, a deliberate act by a Creator ("Creationism")?
The Evolutionists cannot fathom how the other side can ignore the overwhelming evidence for life's beginnings billions of years ago and claim that it is all the result of six days of creation; the Creationists, pointing out that a complex watch required a watchmaker, cannot see how the sudden appearance of Homo sapiens as the most complex life form can deny the Hand of God.
Enter "Intelligent Design"
In the past several years the debate has manifested itself again, with greater vigor, not only in the so-called Bible Belt states, but also in unexpected places as the Michigan House of Representatives and the Pennsylvania education system.  The most recent instance is Ohio, where the arena is the state's Board of Education.
Reports of these developments in the liberal media do not hide a degree of alarm at these developments -- not so much because they continue to occur, but because the attack on Darwinian teachings now come from "Creationism in disguise," and "a good disguise" at that (Time magazine).  The disguise is called "Intelligent Design" ("I.D." for short); Its proponents, by and large, do not take a position on how Life got here; they just deny that natural selection (i.e. evolution) alone could have brought us about.  Somewhere along the way, they hold, there had to be an Intelligent Designer.
What alarms the media and the scientific community is the fact that the proponents of ID are not Bible-waving old ladies, but intellectuals and academics from varied disciplines in science, philosophy and theology.  Their concerted attack on Evolutionism has been called by the established scientific community "a wedge strategy to restore Creationism in disguise" (Science magazine).
Identifying the Intelligent Designer
The proponents of the new version of Creationism, one must conclude from a study of their writings and arguments, find it easier to make a case for Intelligent Design than to answer the question: If so, who was the Intelligent Designer?
While many scientific critics of ID hold that the neo-Creationists are conservative Christians upset about the displacement of God from school curricula, "the fact is that many leaders of the new movement prefer to skirt the question, or even allow an abstract "God" to be embedded in the very beginning of the universe: "No one really knows how the universe got built with DNA that can replicate itself," (in the words of William Demski, a professor of mathematics).
A New York Times Puzzler
In its issue of April 8, 2001, The New York Times, in a page-one article by James Glanz, informed its readers that in spite of some wins by Evolutionists in Kansas, Michigan and Pennsylvania, they "find themselves arrayed not against traditional creationism, with its roots in biblical liberalism, but against a more sophisticated idea: the Intelligent Design theory."
But who, if so, was the Intelligent Designer?  As I was reading the article on that Sunday morning, I was delighted to learn that 
The designer may be much like the biblical God, proponents say, but they are open to other explanations, such as the proposition that life was seeded by a meteorite from elsewhere in the cosmos, or the new age philosophy that the universe is suffused with mysterious but inanimate life force.
That proponents of ID consider the bringing of life to Earth by a meteorite as one explanation, I felt, was close enough to my Sumerian explanation that the Seed of Life (what we now call DNA) was imparted to Earth by the invading planet Nibiru during the collision ("Celestial Battle") some four billion years ago.
But it turned out from examining the newspaper's website and earlier editions, that the New York City edition that I was reading excised an intriguing and key sentence from the original article.  Here is what the paragraph had read in its original version, with the omitted sentence highlighted:
This designer may be much like the biblical God, proponents say, but they are open to other explanations, such as the proposition that life was seeded by a meteorite from elsewhere in the cosmos, POSSIBLY INVOLVING EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE, or the new age philosophy that the universe is suffused with a mysterious but inanimate life force.
"An Advanced Civilization from Another World"
As my readers know, what I have said in my books went beyond the common origin of Life (=DNA) on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe.  I showed that according to the Sumerian texts (on which the biblical account of Genesis was based), Evolution took its course both on Nibiru and on Earth.  Beginning much earlier on Nibiru, it produced the advanced Anunnaki on Nibiru but only early hominids on Earth when the Anunnaki had come here some 450,000 years ago.  Then, I wrote, the Anunnaki engaged in genetic engineering to upgrade the hominids to Homo sapiens (to be in their likeness and after their image, as the Bible says).
While I was still wondering how the extraterrestrial angle was excised from the Times article in April 2001, I was delighted to read thus in its editorial on March 17, 2002.  Headlined Darwinian Struggle in Ohio, the editorial explained:
Adherents of intelligent design carefully shun any mention of God in their proposals.  They simply argue that humans, animals and plants are far too diverse and complex to be explained by evolution and natural selection, so there must have been an intelligent designer behind it all.  Whether that designer is God, AN ADVANCED  CIVILIZATION FROM ANOTHER WORLD, or some other creative force, is not specified.
The emphasis of the astounding statement is mine.
Back to Enki?
This is quite an advance in acknowledging the Sumerian data - from the general possibility of an involvement by "Extraterrestrial Intelligence" in cosmic life, to an Intelligent Designer from "an advanced civilization from another world."
It is progress spanning the tale of the collision that spread the Seed of Life to the genetic engineering by the Lord Enki.
Have the editorial writers of the New York Times read my latest book, The Lost Book of Enki?

Headline: AL MVP race down to two players
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
We're one week removed from the regular season and a big question has yet to be answered.

Who will win the American League MVP?

That question has become an issue of the heart versus the mind.

If you were to write a book of the two candidates, David Ortiz would be the hero.  

The chubby - sometimes goofy- and very colorful "Big Papi" stepped onto the Boston scene three years ago and stole the precious, faithful Red Sox fans.  

With his naïve innocence and flair for the dramatic, Ortiz has somehow transformed himself from a no-good, overweight first baseman, to one of the biggest offensive machines in the game.

On the other side stands the enemy. The blessed child with the silver spoon who seems to be God's gift to baseball - maybe even the world.  He has the charisma, the skills, the looks and the money...and people hate him for it.

In fact, the only reason this is even an issue is because it is David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez. If Rodriguez counterpart, Derek Jeter, were to put up those numbers, they'd be retiring his number early in Yankee Stadium.  

But the guy that gets cheered for making an error and booed when he hits a homerun is hoisting numbers this season that are remarkable for anybody, despite his reputation.

Playing in 161 games this season, Rodriguez finished off the year hitting .321 with 48 homeruns and 130 RBIs.

Seven of his most important batting stats are among the top-five in the American League -  runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS (on-base percentage + slugging percentage).  

Add that to the fact that he's committed only 12 errors in a position he just started playing last season, and you get what should be a unanimous MVP season.

  Despite leading the league in RBIs, hitting .300 and adding 47 homeruns, David Ortiz's numbers fall a short second to Rodriguez.

One wouldn't want to take away from Ortiz's success, but the odds on the stat sheet are definitely against him.  

First off, no full-time designated hitter has ever won a Most Valuable Player Award - and with good reason.

An MVP has to do it all, not just stand in the box, swing the bat, and jog his way through the bases. David Ortiz never plays the field, barely runs the bases, and can't even hit the ball to the opposite field.

However, the qualities that make him successful are those contributions that can't be measured with numbers.  

The unity that he has brought the Red Sox clubhouse has been phenomenal and the clutch, game-winning hits he's provided the last couple of years have been that of legends.

As sad as it is for Alex Rodriguez despisers (which are many), baseball is a numbers game and it is because of this that A-Rod should walk away with the MVP this season.

It's time we give this guy a break. He has been everything we would've wanted from the baseball world and is a definite hero for the post-steroid phase we are embarking.

Alex Rodriguez, the Miami native out of Westminster Christian High School, has been nothing short of brilliant since his call up in 1994. But he has also been treated no better than a criminal offender. It's time guys like him receive what is rightfully theirs.

Headline: Croatian tennis players reunited as FIU stars
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The women's tennis team, often overlooked, is returning all eight of its starters from last year's Sun Belt Championship squad. Reunited at the start of practices earlier this semester, two players from Croatia have success flowing through their blood.

It may be a  surprise that senior Bruna Discordia and sophomore Marijana Cutuk have excelled as tennis players, after growing up in a country smaller than the state of West Virginia but it shouldn't be.

Croatia is quickly becoming the homeland of world-class tennis players. While Discordia and Cutuk helped lead FIU to its first SBC title last season, Ivan Ljubicic and Mario Ancic have taken the professional tour by storm, leading Croatia to the country's first Davis Cup final.

"I was actually at the match in the quarterfinals in Split against Romania,"  Cutuk said. "You should see people screaming [and] shaking on the crucial points. The moment, the players [and] the whole crowd was going through it."

"In Split, when they bring it on, the crowds, they're insane," Discordia said.

Ljubicic and Ancic have shocked the tennis world this year, much like FIU shocked the Sun Belt last spring. 

Ljubicic is riding an 11-match winning streak in Davis Cup ties heading into December's final against the Slovak Republic. Included in his run are victories over Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick in March, which eliminated the United States in the first round.

Discordia and Cutuk - as they begin pre-season competition this Fall - share the sense of pride that Ljubicic and Ancic feel when playing for their country.

"I like that tennis sometimes can become a team sport because usually you play your opponents and it's done," Cutuk said. "Here, you play individually but it's a team spirit thing."

Discordia added, "You have to adjust, especially after so many years of playing junior's [tournament] where everybody's so competitive. They look at you like, 'Oh she's my competition'. But here it's different. You have to adjust, but it's cool."

Discordia and Cutuk have more than just their native land in common. Both Croatians began playing tennis in 1992, meeting three years later at a tennis tournament. Their fondest childhood memories are touring on the International Tennis Federation junior circuit.

Even aspects of their tennis game are near mirror images. The "Croatian backhand," as Cutuk calls it, is the favorite shot of both players. They are grinders from the baseline, preferring to punish groundstrokes rather than chip approach shots. Discordia and Cutuk played each other twice on the ITF circuit, both times on clay, their favorite surface.

In August of 2001, Discordia and Nadja Pavic defeated Cutuk and Vana Thomas 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 at the Epetion Cup in Stobrec. But Cutuk avenged her doubles loss in May of 2003, with a 6-3, 7-5 singles victory over Discordia in Biograd. 

"Before that we played a lot of times," Discordia said, laughing with Cutuk as they both struggle to remember the doubles match.

Advice was passed between the future teammates at the tournament in Biograd. Discordia had just returned to Croatia after her freshman season at FIU, and Cutuk was eager to talk college with her countrywoman.

"I actually asked her about this school then because I already wanted to come here," Cutuk said. "I asked her 'how is it there?' and stuff like that."

Discordia gave Cutuk head coach Ronnie Bernstein's e-mail address and the rest is Golden Panther history.

The Croatian national champion in 2001, Discordia was integral in FIU's SBC title run. Discordia displayed good hands at the net in doubles, finishing 17-6 with partners Shilla D'Armas and Courtney Jonson and also finished with a 10-6 singles record. Discordia's success in doubles dates back to her days as a junior, when she won three ITF titles.

"I've become kind of a doubles expert, especially coming here to FIU," said Discordia, who hails from the Croatian capital Zagreb. "It depends also on who you're playing because if you click with a partner, you enjoy the game. I enjoy doubles more than singles."

Meanwhile, Cutuk was a first-year phenomenon for the Golden Panthers. The Split native finished the season with a 20-9 singles record, winning 12 of 13 matches from Feb. 27 to Apr. 23. The pressure of playing against older, more experienced players never fazed her.

"I knew right from the start that I'm going to play and I have to do my best," said Cutuk. "You want to win, it doesn't matter if it's a college match or a pro match like I'd played before. You want to win the game."

The Croatians shined during the postseason. Cutuk won singles matches and Discordia won doubles matches against Louisiana-Lafayette and Denver before FIU toppled South Alabama in the final to emerge as Sun Belt champions. 

"It was really satisfying," Cutuk said. "We really practiced a lot, a lot, a lot - I think even more than other sports. It's hard, with school and everything. I'm happy that we finally achieved something."

Discordia also expressed pride, but noted that something is still missing.

"We didn't get rings yet, so we're kind of pissed off," she said jokingly.

Against Florida State in the first round of the NCAA Finals, Discordia and Cutuk elevated their games once again to help FIU advance. Entering a new season, Discordia and Cutuk have been preparing for a preseason classic, to be held at the University of Miami Nov. 11-13. But their minds are on bigger and better things, starting with the Davis Cup final.

"We'll win," said Cutuk. "Slovakia, they are good. But we are better."

As the calendar turns to 2006, Discordia and Cutuk share championship aspirations for FIU.

"[Our goal is] winning the conference," says Discordia. "We have good chances of going to the NCAAs again."

With a gleam in her eye, Cutuk adds, "Maybe we'll get two rings at the same time together."

Subheadline: Resolution to parking problem 
Author: Laura Hardesty / Junior
&nbsp;
I was warned of two things before coming to FIU: Computer programming classes are conducted without computers in front of students, and the parking is terrible. The former is unbelievably true and the latter is the understatement of the millennium. The parking is not terrible, it is a racket!  Students are charged $62 per semester for insufficient parking, forced to waste gasoline while circling or stalking other students for an hour before class to secure a parking spot. Not to mention, the cost of the parking tickets when you must decide if $20-30 dollars is worth it in order to arrive on time for your test.

Where is all this revenue going to if not to provide for enough parking? To the money pit of millions to construct more colleges in order to attract even more students to the University Park campus? Or reportedly toward the $26 million debt to add a mere 2,800 spaces (that's $9,300 per slot), which brings FIU to a total of 11,000 parking spots - for BOTH CAMPUSES.

Even though the parking issue has been ongoing, FIU admitted a freshman class 10 percent larger than any year previous. Adding 2,800 spots was like dropping a bucket of water into the rising tide. Over 35,000 commuters are vying for 11,000 spaces.

Here's a solution, there is a lot of open land around the campus that could be used for parking. Normally I would say save the land, but face it, every inch of South Florida is being developed anyway. If you take half the total number of commuters (for University Park campus), 15,000 at $62, for just ONE semester that is $930,000. That income should go toward expanding the existing parking lots out to 8th street and other perimeter streets. For $930,000 I will come out and pave the land and make a parking lot! And here is the way to demand a solution: If you are sick of paying $62 a semester (without a choice)  for the dubious privilege of driving in circles before class, send an e-mail to the president and let FIU know you want resolution in a timely manner. That e-mail is: Modesto.Maidique@fiu.edu

Subheadline: Smart move, Bush picks woman  to Supreme Court
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As though it had been a day at the race tracks, Washington insiders spent most of the weeks preceding President George Bush's nomination for a new Supreme Court justice yelling names and speculating about who would be the winner.

Many had already predicted that the final choice would be narrowed down either to a minority (most foresaw the first Hispanic justice) or a woman, a logical replacement for retiring judge Sandra Day O'Connor who was the first female in the High Court.

Though Bush did end up picking a woman, his choice was unexpected: Harriet Miers, a 60-year-old White House lawyer.

However, more surprising than the nomination were the reactions that followed, especially from conservative politicians.

According to an Associated Press report, Senator Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, a well known pro-life supporter  stated that "he is prepared to vote against Miers if he disagrees with her judicial philosophy."

Other senators and right-wing pundits have been belching the same opinions, declaring Bush's decision as unwise because he did not pick a judge whose track record reflects their ideology.

These types of accusations seem ridiculous, especially since Bush has managed to pick a seemingly non-partisan candidate who has kept her distance from current White House politics. With accusations of cronyism, corruption and favoritism running rampant on Capitol Hill, conservatives should look at Miers' nomination with relief.

Even her past as a lawyer, which has also come under attack, shouldn't be seen as a negative attribute. Her years working the floor, arguing cases and interacting with clients can bring a freshness to the decisions of a court full of judges grown accustomed to life behind the bench.

Like every justice, Miers should be expected to follow her own conscience and experience when interpreting the law, not the beliefs of a certain group of party. By attacking this very concept, the nay-sayers have only managed to further expose the sad workings of today's political machine.

Headline: Afghanistan: Opium trade larger problem than war
Author: Jessica Garcia-Iñiguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It seems that Afghanistan and opium are at the brink of resembling the relationship between Colombia and cocaine. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium and its derivative, heroin.

 Opium comes from the poppy plant, which produces natural opiates, a drug derived from the milky substance extracted from the unripe poppy seeds. 

The opiates are best known as narcotics. There are 20 different alkaloids derived from the opiates, one of which is the widely abused drug known as heroin.

The new Afghan government has recognized this developing problem throughout the last few years. They asked the United Nations to assist them in minimizing opium production, in hopes that heroin abuse will be reduced. 

The UN's current strategy is focused on an educational campaign that hopes to influence farmers' focus away from poppy cultivation,  onto other crops. 

However, efforts to sway farmers to produce different crops have been largely ineffective. 

The idea of halting poppy production is not supported much in Afghanistan. 

The opium trade accounts for two-thirds of the country's income and 60 percent of the nation's output. 

It is reported that one in eight people, of Afghanistan's population of 30 million, is involved in the opium trade. Some international efforts have even offered money to Afghan farmers to grow alternative crops, but the commercial value of growing poppies is so high that most are reluctant to stop in fear of losing their livelihood. 

Opium production has grown consecutively for three consecutive years, despite efforts to halt it.

The course of action being taken is simply not working or being accepted despite the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid and military presence. 

Rather than eradicate opium production, steps toward controlling it would be more beneficial to the Afghan economy. In a report sent out in late September, the Senlis Council called for the legalization of opium poppy fields. 

This French - based council argues that a ban on the narcotic would fuel the ever-growing illegal drug trade. 

The council suggests that Afghanistan should follow the steps of India, which legally grows poppy for sale to the UN and United States for medicinal purposes. 

Other alkaloids derived from the opiates include codeine and morphine, both used in the medical field as pain relievers and are lacking in developing countries. 

The Senlis report says that a medical drug policy would help the country's development. It adds that the legalization of opium cultivation in Afghanistan would need to be backed by a strong regulatory system. 

Such a policy could allow Afghanistan to develop its own patented opium medicines, which would allow it to form beneficial trade agreements with other regions. 

Illegal opium exports go untaxed, leaving the private sector deprived of finances that could be used to rebuild the country's economy. 

The establishment of a national authority to license opium production would "integrate illegal actors into the opium licensing systems." 

According to the UN, "the absence of an adequate control system remains the main argument against legalization of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan." 

The UN and other foreign countries, like Britain, are already giving hundreds of millions of dollars and providing a military presence to resolve the illegal opium abuse. 

Rather than focus attention and assets on a program that has been, and seems to continue, failing the Afghan government should divert their efforts into a regulatory system of opium production. 

Taming the opium industry in Afghanistan would be key, not eradicating it.

Headline: Evolution:
Subheadline: Controversies nothing more than dogma to some
Author: Christine Liriano / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Ever since the dawn of time, the answer to the controversial question, how we humans came to be, has been divided into many different beliefs. 

There is an ongoing debate over the theory of Intelligent Design (ID) vs. Evolution - at least in politics and in the media - about these two opposing theories being taught in public schools. To many, the controversy seems to involve two conflicting science concepts. Or worse, two conflicting belief systems. That is not the circumstance, however. So, what is it?

For those of us who know little or nothing about either theory, Intelligent Design states that we contain elements so complex that they cannot be explained by another theory. Therefore, we must be products of an intelligent designer. Many call this designer God, but those who don't agree with Intelligent Design carefully avoid using the G-word. 

On the other hand goes the Theory of Evolution. This states that we primarily evolved as particles and developed into humans over a period of time. Where this issue is causing  controversy is in our public schools, about what can and cannot be taught.

From educators to parents, from scientists to creationists, everyone has a different idea on how the world was created. Some believe that only scientific facts can be used to prove whether a theory is logical or false. Others believe that the Bible is enough evidence to prove that ID is and should be considered a scientific theory. 

The uprising question is, what theory should be taught in public schools? 

There has always been a separation between the power of the Church and the State, especially in 1987 when the Supreme Court ruled that public schools couldn't teach the theory of creation instead of evolution. Doing so would collide with the First Amendment and its ban on establishing an official religion.

Yet, on Aug. 1, a group of reporters from Texas met with President George Bush to see what his opinions were on this subject. He believes that both, Intelligent Design and Evolution, should be taught so that people are exposed to different views of thought. 

President Bush's opinion is shared by millions of Americans. According to a recent Harris poll, only 12 percent of Americans think evolution should be taught instead of Intelligent Design. 

As well, Dr.. Marvalee Wake of the American Institute of Biological Sciences criticized the president, "Intelligent Design is not a scientific theory and must not be taught in science classes. 

If we want students to be able to compete in the global economy, we must make sure that we taught them science. We simply cannot begin to introduce non-scientific concepts into the science curriculum."

It seems foolish that after all these years, this issue is still not settled. However, 15 years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a Louisiana law commanding equal time for creationism, 140 years after Darwin published "On the Origin of Species", and 190 years after Paley used the "divine watchmaker" analogy to spread the argument that we must have a creator, the issue of how to teach the theory of life was still being argued between subject experts. 

Teaching about religion is allowed in public schools, but many thoughts remain about where the line should be drawn between devotional teaching of religion and academic teaching about religion. 

We do not have the power to choose what theory students should learn, and by choosing one set theory, that is exactly what we are doing. 

The option to decide which theory we feel more comfortable with should be placed solely on us. Whether you're on the side that believes that Intelligent Design is or is not a scientific theory, or believe that they should both be taught, this problem will continue to persist as long as science is taught in schools. 

Students should be allowed to learn about both views, when subject experts disagree about such an issue that crosses with the public-school curriculum. 

We as students should continue to keep an open mind on either theory and understand that they can, in fact, be just theories.

Headline: Israel conflict addressed at Middle-East lecture
Author: Robin Chicly / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
An ethnically diverse mix of students, faculty, administrators and parents filled Biscayne Bay Campus's  Mary Ann Wolfe Center on Sept. 28 for a lecture by Asher Susser, director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at the Tel Aviv University.

 Susser was the first of six speakers to speak as part of the Ruth K. & Shepard Broad Educational Series.

 Susser's lecture focused on whether Israel's disengagement from Gaza was about peace or war.

 "It is not the easiest thing to do, to expel 5,000 Israelis from Gaza," Susser said.

He posed rhetorical questions. "Why did the Israelis move out of Gaza? It is not the external powers that influence peace or war in the Middle East," Susser said. "But the people of the Middle East that make the wars and make the peace."

Susser argued that there has always been a history of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Asking for concessions, such as land, causes greater strife. In recent years, we are seeing a steady decline in the influence of the Arab states in the Middle East. 

"The Middle East should not be described as the Arab world it once was," Susser said. 

He explained to the audience that current affairs in the Middle East are changing. Israel's rising gross domestic product, for example, is now twice the size of Saudi Arabia's and over  20 times larger than Egypt's. 

Susser also addressed issues that affect student lives, like gas prices. In Susser's view, high gas prices do not equate to wealthy Arabs. Saudis in the oil industry are scared of higher oil prices because it means gas-powered cars may soon come to an end. The higher prices only place pressure on big companies to expedite an alternative. 

According to Susser, whether Israel's disengagement from Gaza is about peace or war remains to be seen.

One student wondered what was the difference between a Palestinian and an Israeli Arab when Israel defines itself as a land for all people?

"In terms of their collective identity, there is no difference," Susser said. "The Arabs of Israel refer to themselves as Palestinians of Israel."

Most students were impressed with the scope of Susser's lecture.

"I really feel like the speaker went through the entire conflict of the Middle East in a way that exposed the real problems of the people. He's a masterful speaker," said Ryan Jaggasar, a sophomore and majoring in business administration.

Headline: Seniors enjoy younger crowd, courses
Author: C.R. Bauman
&nbsp;
Hubert Harriman walks down the halls of the Wolfe University Center, at noon every Monday, at the Biscayne Bay Campus. He observes the campus as he looks forward to his next class. He has no assignment to hand in and he doesn't receive a grade. He's just there for some leisure education. 

He's an auditor, a senior citizen who registers for free to participate in classes that professors allow.  There are many auditors like him here at the BBC, and Mr. Harriman has met approximately two dozen.

"They're like regulars," he said.

Pat Rice, another auditor at BBC, agrees.

"You've got retired lawyers, academics, and people who've always wanted to get an education. There are all types of backgrounds," Rice said.

This program is open only to senior citizens and is free of charge, but they participate in the class in the same way regular students do.

 Most senior citizens enrolled as auditors have already experienced the world and are just following through with their interests. For example, Mr. Harriman's interests include philosophy, art, music, and some sciences, and he follows up on those interests by taking classes. The interaction between younger and older students can add diversity to the class.	

Jillian Tobie, a freshman trying to get accustomed to college life, found the experience difficult to get used to at first.

"It feels strange because high school has an age limit," she said.

Other students, like Shalaka McFarlane, a freshman, enjoys the experience and wisdom older students bring into the classroom. 

"Their maturity and the questions they ask teachers make [young students] think harder," she said.

Harriman also gains from young students.

"I get more interaction with the younger students, they're nice to talk to," Harriman said, who was a member of the humanity club when it was very active several years ago.

Rice, a retired professor from the University of Miami, considers herself  " ... very lucky to be able to do this."

She attends classes in order to appreciate the academic environment and occasionally helps younger students.

 "I do read the textbook and try to do the assignments ... I've proofread student papers and brought in handouts. I always try to help in any way possible," she said.

Like Mr. Harriman, Rice admits she has enrolled in a variety of courses.

"I like to take classes outside of my main interest, [which is education] so that I can get my mind working differently," said Rice. "I've taken courses on history, computers, and political science, among others."   

The Academy for Lifelong Learning (ALL) is a part of FIU located in the Kovens Center, where like the auditing program, senior citizens can take non-credit courses as well. The difference is senior citizens are separated from undergraduate students, according to the ALL course guide. 

"Our mission remains to promote opportunities for adults to expand their knowledge through non-credit personal enrichment programming," said Dr. Susan Jay, director of the academy, in the course guide. 

The program has approximately 800 to 1,000 senior citizens enrolled, and classes meet at least once per week.

Whichever program senior citizens have enrolled in they provide different perspectives and enlighten other students. There are other, under appreciated benefits, too.

"Taking notes gets rid of arthritis," Rice said.

Headline: Police enforce speed limit on Panther Way
Author: Fallan Thompson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Speeders beware! North Miami police are cracking down on speeders and aggressive drivers. Both the North Miami traffic safety unit and the aggressive driving unit will be patrolling 151 Street for the next two weeks.

Vice Provost Raul Moncarz contacted safety officer Frank Tomassini to gain the support of the North Miami police following two serious accidents last year and the increase of construction.

The North Miami police patrol for Biscayne Bay Campus extends from Biscayne Boulevard to the stop sign at the entrance of the school. 

The posted speed limit from 151 Street, also known as Panther Way, and Biscayne Boulevard to FIU's BBC is 35 mph, but cars have been clocked going 75 mph and over, according to Sgt. Robert Bage of the North Miami police traffic safety unit.

Bage, along with his traffic safety unit of five officers, is heading a two-week long patrol on 151 Street starting Oct. 10.

 "We will be out there for at least an hour everyday for two weeks and hopefully we'll see improvement," he said.

In addition to the Biscayne Landings condominiums and the public elementary school construction sites, joggers and bike riders also frequent 151 Street.

 "The volume of traffic has increased in recent years," Tomassini said. 

 Aggressive driving is when a driver commits two traffic violations at one time which affects fellow drivers.

 "Things such as speeding and illegal lane change at the same time is something that we look for," Bage said.

Bage and Blanchard explained that the radar on the back of the police motorcycle works like a Doppler radar on a plane, and the higher the pitch the radar gives off, the faster the car is going. 

The handheld radar gun works the same way but can reach up to 2,000 feet away from the officer to catch a driver's speed. 

 "Most officers will not pull over someone going five mph over the speed limit, but when someone is going 10 mph or over, it begins to create a hazard," said officer Donald Blanchard of the North Miami police traffic safety unit.

During the hour-long patrol that took place on Oct. 3, the officers pulled over several speeding cars and gave the drivers warnings.

However, a silver BMW was clocked going 80 mph in the 35 mph zone. 

The driver was pulled over and issued a ticket. According to the pamphlet given to ticketed drivers in Miami-Dade County, the driver of the BMW will have to pay $323.50 for speeding. 

In addition to students, sales associates at Prestige Auto, a high-performance car dealership, have been warned by Officer Tomassini not to use 151 Street as a reckless driving site. 

 "They are taking these Ferraris out and opening them up," said officer Tomassini.

Students should also consider that when the elementary school is complete, there will be a school speed zone implemented. Also, construction along 151 St. may continue for several years because construction for a public high school will begin when the elementary school is complete.

FIU's Department of Public Safety and officer Tomassini will handle violations occurring on campus, however, if someone were to commit a crime on 151 St., North Miami police can issue a ticket on campus.

Accidents last year include a professor who was speeding around the curve before the stadium, late at night. He lost control and hit a tree. Another recent accident was a fatality at the intersection of 151 St. and Biscayne Boulevard when someone ran a red light. The fatality involved 86-year-old, Pearl Ferber, who lost her life and her husband, who survived with injury.

In the mean time, some students have vowed to be more careful.

 "I can't believe people go so fast down that street. I will definitely be more careful," said Brenda Espina, a junior and journalism major. 

And other student, Rachelle Pittman agrees.

"It sucks to get a ticket, but you can definitely kill someone going 80 mph," Pittman, a junior and advertising major said. "It's a good idea they're patrolling  because now people will watch out."

Headline: Maidique delivers state of university address
Subheadline: President discusses hurricane relief efforts, medical school proposal 
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A medical school proposal and the progress of Hurricane Katrina relief efforts were just two of the issues raised at university President Modesto A. Maidique's annual State Of The University Address, delivered October 6. 

"We're getting better every day, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished," Maidique said in his speech at the Graham Center auditorium, which was also broadcast live to the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Maidique cited the expansion of the Honors College, the establishment of the new College of Law and its rapid ascension to the ranks of the state's best law schools. 

Other signs of growth: The opening of a new national resource center for National Studies through the Center of Transnational and Comparative Studies as evidence of growth.

Most importantly, the Board of Governors will hold a vote Nov. 17 on approving the establishment of a School of Medicine - a day Maidique described as "fateful, second only to the founding of the university" in its importance and prospective impact.  

If the Board approves, the School of Medicine is scheduled to open in 2008.

Maidique expressed cautious optimism that the vote would succeed and stressed the need for success, citing the importance not only to the university, but also to South Florida.  

"The South Florida region is underserved in the medical area," Maidique said.  "Eighty-five percent of our doctors are out of state or international."  

Other projects in the works include renovating and expanding the football stadium and the construction of a new social sciences building as well as a molecular biology building to serve as cornerstones for the new medical school.

Maidique also acknowledged the challenges facing the university.

"We've much to be proud of, but we've also experienced difficulties in the past year," he said, citing difficulties with PantherSoft implementation and "woefully inadequate" state funding.  

According to Maidique, the state legislature funded only 55 percent of what the Board of Governors requested for FIU enrollment.  

The university expected to add almost $13 million to its base budget, but got only $7 million.  

Maidique decried the fact that the money had to come from increased tuition costs.  

"Raising tuition is not the way to make ends meet.  Let's face the means to make a commitment and not continue to balance the budget on the backs of the students," he said.

Yet Maidique also praised the record number of donations to FIU: $39 million in cash gifts, cash pledges and commitments, including $20 million from an anonymous donor, the president said.

Regarding the 2005-2006 academic year, Maidique cited the implementation of new academic programs as well as problems caused by the largest freshman class in FIU's history, such as overcrowded classes.  

"Our total enrollment now exceeds 37,000, of which we have more than 5,000 graduate students," Maidique said. "We're offering 5,750 different courses this Fall, and have hired almost 60 full-time faculty members. Unfortunately, they're all new faculty. We really need 60 new faculty members, not just replacements for ones who have left."

Maidique cited FIU's efforts in aiding the victims of Hurricane Katrina: The university has raised approximately $16,600 to date for hurricane relief; the number was expected to rise. 

The money will be donated to the University of New Orleans.

Concluding on an elegiac note, the president called upon the university wide community to help FIU fulfill its destiny.

"We are imbedded in a community that is clearly rising, and we must continue to rise with it.  I am confident that we have the talent amongst our students, faculty and staff to make it happen," Maidique said. 

Reactions to the address were overwhelmingly positive from students and staff alike.  

"He certainly addressed an area that we are always concerned about, and that is raising money and making sure that we are continually able to increase those numbers," said Sumner Hutcheson, associate vice president for development in the University Advancement Division.  

"It was what I'd hoped it would be in terms of its comprehensive nature," said junior Randy Mora.  "It spoke to all the interested parties."

Headline: Theatre school to premiere comedic play
Author: Leoncio Alvarez and Shley Capo / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
FIU's Theatre School will be putting up their first show of the season on Oct. 13 - 23, titled "Inspecting Carol." The show will run Thursdays through Sundays at 8 p.m. A matinee showing will take place on Sundays at 2 p.m.

Unlike their past shows, this one takes a different turn from the dramatic and musical route - "Inspecting Carol" is a laugh-out-loud riot.

Geoffrey Tangeman, director of the production, believes the FIU community will benefit from watching the production in various ways.

"Everyone enjoys a comedy. The show offers escapism from daily problems and offers a chance to experience another person's life." Tangeman said.

In a nutshell, the play is about a struggling theater company who's on the verge of losing a major sponsorship from the National Endowment for the Arts. 

The only way the company has a chance at keeping the sponsorship is if the NEA inspects them during their annual performance of "A Christmas Carol." 

Their world turns upside down when an aspiring actor, Wayne Wellacre, played by junior Daniel Saltos, enters as a horrible actor trying to get a job in the company, confusing the cast and audience as to whether or not he is a bad actor or the inspector sent from NEA.

It's been nearly six years since FIU has performed a comedy, let alone a farce. This is what inspired Tangeman to bring the play to the Wertheim theatre main stage. 

"I saw the show 10 years ago and thought the script was very clever. A cast of various types is offered to the audience, Tangeman said. 

"Comedy skills are always needed for actors and the play offers its members the opportunity to gain comedic knowledge needed in the acting world," he added.

The show is a great opportunity for young actors because no comedy courses are taught in the BFA theatre program, according to Denisse Schwartz, assistant director for the production.

"I have worked with Geoff [Tangman] in the past on "Marisol" last spring and I greatly enjoyed it. I've worked as an assistant director in film before, but the two are completely different. It has been an experience getting to see everyone grow throughout the show," Schwartz said.  "Theatre is a lot harder than film."

The show has a variety of characters, including a nervous business manager, an absent-minded elder, an overly artistic divorcee and a not so Tiny Tim, among many others.

Sure to bring about the Christmas cheer early, "Inspecting Carol" guarantees lots of laughter and relatable characters to remember to its audience.

Subheadline: Squatting exercises harmful if performed improperly
Author: Edwin Ryan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Imagine trying to stand up from your bed in the morning, but as you do you fall back to your bed. Imagine not being able to get out of your car or gently lower your body onto the seat of a chair. What these activities have in common is that they all involve the squatting pattern. 

A young lady approached me recently for the purpose of assisting her with a leg workout program. When I suggested the squat as one of the exercises, she quickly answered "No, I can't squat, and the last time I tried it I almost fell on my face." What this young lady explained to me was that she was unable to keep her center of gravity over her base of support during one of the most fundamental patterns known to man. I explained to her how important squatting was and discussed modifications. I evaluated her squat later and she now has perfect form and reports feeling stronger during daily activities requiring the squatting position.

The squat is one of the most essential patterns known to human beings. The squat has been performed since our existence. Our ancestors squatted to do many things throughout the day including eating, using the toilet and plowing the land. 

Today the activity is still assumed in many functional daily activities - however, many people don't understand how to correctly perform the squat and as a result continuously stress their joints and other connective tissues of the spine and limbs leading to serious injuries. What is most important is to identify what good squatting is, discuss common faults and identify ways to improve squatting form.

The ideal squat is performed with all the natural curves of the spine present (no bending or extending) and without torso turning (rotation), or side to side movement (lateral shifting). Additionally, when the squat is performed correctly, the bar will align over the mid foot at the descent (Figure 1). There are a number of common faults when performing the squat that will lead to injury and affect your ability to perform daily activities. Problem number one involves excessive trunk bending. 

This can be caused by poor squatting technique as well as tight hip flexors (the muscles in the front of hip). This excessive trunk flexion causes the bar to go beyond the space occupied by your feet, and this creates excessive stress on the spine (Figure 2).

This can be corrected by addressing motion restrictions with appropriate stretches and by performing the squat with good technique. 

Problem number two involves the inability to maintain good spinal alignment, especially at the bottom of the lift, usually accompanied with descending pass parallel (Figure 3). To correct this, one would need to stretch the hamstring and gluteus maximus and learn good squatting technique. Problem number three is a lateral movement toward either foot (Figure 4). Any sideways movement usually indicates joint restriction in the ankle, knee or hip of the opposite leg. Therefore, if there is a shift to the right, the joint restriction is probably in the left leg. 

Finally problem number five involves torso rotation which is seen as a swinging of the bar in which one end is ahead of the other when viewed from the side. 

This places tremendous twisting force on the spine and is often accompanied with the lateral shift mentioned above. 

To solve swinging and lateral shifting while squatting, one may need to perform appropriate stretches for the calves, hamstrings and quadriceps as well the large muscles on the back of the hips (gluteus maximus) and the muscles that turn the hips outward (hip external rotators). 

Finally, if you just simply cannot get the squat even after trying all these techniques and you do not want to seek advice from a certified personal fitness trainer, certified athletic trainer or physical therapist, you can choose a version of the squat that is less demanding. The following progression is recommended:

Squat while holding a solid support, such as a squat rack. then perform the squat with the form of a Swiss Ball (Figure 5).

This allows you to learn the correct form without having to balance your center of gravity over your base of support.

When performing the Swiss Ball squat on should ensure that the knee is allowed to track over to the mid foot as it does during the regular squat. 

This allows you to start learning how to correctly bend at your knees while keeping neutral alignment.

Use of a Smith Machine is another progression. This would allow you to be able to load the squat without the fear of losing your balance.

Your goal should be to progress to the unsupported functional squatting pattern, and help you develop strong powerful leg muscles.  

Even if you're not concerned with aesthetics, learning good squatting technique would greatly reduce your risk of injury and reduce your chances of falling into the toilet bowl.

Headline: Rock Out
Subheadline: Fall concert tours rock South Florida and beyond
Author: Geoffre Anderson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Fall has just started and rock artists are already hitting the road in support of their latest releases. 

Prominent rock bands like U2 and tour packages such as the Nintendo Fusion Tour will all be making stops in Miami and Ft. Lauderdale throughout the fall concert season. Here is a brief rundown of just some of the many artists and tours coming:


Audioslave

In support of their latest album Out of Exile,  Audioslave will perform at the University of Miami's Convocation Center on Tuesday, Oct. 18th. 

The outing is part of the band's first-ever headlining arena tour that runs through Nov. 18th and several of the dates on the tour are already sold out. However, tickets are still available for the Miami concert.

Nonetheless, ticket sellouts should come as no surprise because of the band's successful singles "Your Time Has Come" and "Be Yourself," both of which have topped rock and alternative radio charts. Audioslave's latest single "Doesn't Remind Me" has met similar success on radio and television outlets.

Supporting acts on the tour include Seether and 30 Seconds to Mars.


The Nintendo Fusion Tour

For the third straight year, the Nintendo Fusion tour will be arriving in cities nationwide. Set for an Oct. 19th stop in Ft. Lauderdale's Revolution nightclub, the tour fuses popular rock artists and the latest videogames from Nintendo.

Attendees will be able to play new videogames like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess while enjoying the sounds of artists such as pop-punk headliners Fall Out Boy. 

Fall Out Boy has recently garnered much attention because of their breakout single "Sugar, We're Going Down" off of their latest album From Under the Cork  Tree.

The Starting Line, Boys Night Out, Motion City Soundtrack and Panic! At the Disco will also be performing on the tour.


Coheed and Cambria 

Having just released their new album Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness last month, progressive-rock band Coheed and Cambria will appear at the Ft. Lauderdale Revolution nightclub on Saturday, Oct. 29th.

The band's latest album debuted at #7 on the Billboard Charts with 84,000+ units sold in its first week. 

Their current single "Welcome Home" has already gained a lot of exposure, including appearances on the Madden NFL 2005  videogame and ESPN commercials. Supporting acts on the tour are the Blood Brothers, Dredg, and mewithoutYou.


U2

As part of their Vertigo Tour, U2 returns to Florida with two stops lined up in Miami: Nov. 13th  and 14th. The band has achieved enormous success with their newest album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, released late last year. Their current single "City of Blinding Lights" hit radio outlets in June and has since been in regular rotation on media outlets worldwide.

U2 started the tour after a notable summer: the group performed with artists Coldplay and Pink Floyd at the Live 8 concert in London back in early July. The band will be performing on both Miami dates to sold out crowds at the American Airlines Arena and supporting acts have yet to be announced.


Saves the Day/Senses Fail 

To round out the fall concert season, power-pop/punk band Saves the Day and screamo band Senses Fail make a Dec. 10th arrival in Ft. Lauderdale at the Revolution nightclub.

As of late, both bands have kept themselves busy with new releases and regular concert performances. Saves the Day is currently recording and mastering their new album, slated for a Jan. 2006 release.

Senses Fail finished their stint on the Vans Warped Tour in Aug. and expects to release a limited edition of their current album Let it Enfold You in Nov.

The bands are joined on tour by The Early November and Say Anything.
