Headline: Baseball extends home win streak with sweep
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The baseball team extended its home winning streak to 13 games following a three-game sweep of Rutgers March 10-12 at University Park Stadium.

FIU's record improves to 13-8, while the Scarlet Knights drop to 3-11 on the season.

"I think it's important to keep on playing good baseball," head coach Danny Price said. "And I think we're playing good baseball."

Senior Michael Lopez finished the weekend 7-for-13 with two homeruns, six RBI, three doubles and two runs scored.

Senior Bryan Pullin extended his hitting streak to 26 games.



FIU 7, Rutgers 3



11 hits from the top five batters in the order led the Golden Panthers to victory in the opening game of the series.

Senior Nick Cadena led the offense, going 3-for-4 with two RBI.

Starting pitcher Walker Whitley, who has not allowed an earned run in 26 innings, got his fourth win of the season. Whitley pitched six inning, allowed five hits, struck out six batters and walked three.

Senior Frank Gonzalez pitched the final three innings of the game and earned his first save of the season.

The Scarlet Knights left the bases loaded to begin the game and FIU took advantage of the missed opportunity, scoring two runs in the bottom of the first.

FIU capped off its victory with a four-run sixth inning, which featured a two-RBI double by Lopez and a two-run homerun by Cadena.

Rutgers prevented the shut out in the seventh inning when Ryan Hill hit a two-run homerun, followed by an RBI single later in the inning.





FIU 16, Rutgers 7



Sophmore Corey Lozano led FIU's 16-run attack, going 2-for-2 with a walk a homerun and five RBI.

Miami-Dade transfer Akeem Francis, who came in with an 11-5 lead, pitched six innings of work, allowed one run, five hits and struck out five batters to earn the win out of the bullpen.

"[The lead] doesn't help me because I still got to pitch like I'm in a tie," Francis said. "The thing is, you have to work ahead - throw a lot of first pitch strikes - and get help from the position players behind me."

After Rutgers put up a run in the opening inning, FIU responded with six runs in the bottom half. Cadena started things off with a two-run home run - his second in as many games - followed by a three-run home run by Lozano. The Golden Panthers added another run before the end of the inning to make the score 6-3.

Rutgers cut the lead in half the very next inning, but FIU again replied with an offensive display, scoring five runs - highlight by a two-RBI double from Pullin.

Rutgers would again add two more runs off starter Eric Hortsman in the top of the third inning, but it wouldn't be enough.

FIU scored in every inning except the fourth, sixth and eighth.

"I thought it was a good ball game offensively," Price said. "Defensively, we seemed to do what we needed to do."



FIU 12, Rutgers 9



The Golden Panthers completed the sweep of the Scarlet Knights off the bat of Lopez, whose two homeruns and four RBI were the difference.

Kyle Preshong got the win in relief of starter Chris Siebenaler, who was pulled in the fifth inning.

Gonzalez earned his second save of the weekend, pitching a scoreless ninth inning.

FIU jumped out to a 2-0 lead off of the first of Lopez's two homeruns. The score would eventually be knotted 4-4, until the sixth inning when FIU scored seven runs - highlighted by Lopez's second two-run homerun and an RBI double from James McOwen.

The Scarlet Knights did not go down without a fight. Trailing 12-4, Rutgers started a five-run rally in the eighth that abruptly came to an end when Chris Dunn made a leaping catch against the wall in right field - knocking down a sponsor's sign.

"Once we jumped up on that big score, we had a little bit of break down, a little bit of a lack of focus," Price said. "I was very displeased the way we played the last five innings out there."

Headline: Softball coach earns 400th career win
Author: Patrick Jordan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Coach Kim Gwydir accomplished a monumental feat, earning her 400th career victory game behind her team's stellar performance. The milestone victory March 12 came as FIU defeated Rhode Island 6-5 in the championship game of the Blue & Gold Felsberg Memorial at University Park.

The Golden Panthers (10-15) have won three of their last five games. 

Making the all-tournament team for the Golden Panthers was senior left fielder Cassie Parker, freshman first baseman Lauren Spiers, sophomore pitcher Kerri Houck and junior catcher Tabitha Embry, who was also named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. 



Rhode Island 8, FIU 3



Coming off a 3-0 loss to Harvard on March 10, the Golden Panthers were looking for redemption and sought to get it against the Rhode Island Rams, who were 0-5 prior to playing FIU. The March 11 afternoon game was supposed to be a bright spot in the Golden Panthers day. The Rams came out and quickly made their presence felt on the scoreboard in the first inning when Rhode Island first baseman Courtney Wall hit a double to left center, bringing home centerfielder Stefani Poedubicky from first base.

With the score 1-0 going into the bottom of the second inning, momentum seemed to be on the Golden Panthers side when third baseman Samantha Card was up to bat with two outs and Powell on third base. Card doubled into right center, only to have catcher Jennifer Powell caught in rundown at home plate to end the inning.

Pitcher Penny Eastman then ran into trouble in the top of third inning as she faced Rhode Island third baseman Alyssa Martino with two outs and the bases loaded. Martino singled in two runs, making the score 3-0 Rams.

The bottom of the fourth inning proved that the Golden Panthers had some fight in them as Powell hit a double with two outs. Parker quickly followed with another double, bringing Powell home to make the score 4-1. Unfortunately, one run was all that FIU dug up as a grounder ended the inning.

FIU's pitching change at the top of the six inning did nothing to stop the Rams' firepower as they tacked on two more runs making the score 8-1, putting the game out of reach.

FIU tacked on two more runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, but it was too little too late as the Rams won their first game of the season, dropping Eastman's record to 5-4. 



FIU 16, Manhattan 1



FIU's 15-run margin of victory tied a school record and the 16 runs scored in the game was a school record as FIU beat Manhattan. Fueled by the loss earlier to Rhode Island, FIU approached the evening game with intent to destroy their opponent. Unfortunately for Manhattan, they didn't stand a chance as the Golden Panthers jumped on them right from the get go with the first six batters for FIU hitting singles and eventually scoring, making the score 6-0 after the top of the first inning.

The third inning saw FIU add a season high seven runs, including a homerun by freshman outfielder Kim Rodriguez, her second of the year, as she went 2-3 with three RBI's. The inning was also led by Fink and Spiers, who both hit singles and Parker and Card, who both hit doubles. The four players combined to hit 8-for-15 with eight RBI.

Manhattan finally got on the scoreboard during the bottom of the third inning with a groundout by designated hitter Deirdre Langan, bringing in third baseman Kerry Cook. It was one and done as Manhattan didn't score for the remainder of the game and FIU added another run making the score 16-1 and subsequently the finale.

The Golden Panthers had 16 hits in the game compared to just two for Manhattan. Pitcher Kerri Houck's record improved to 3-5, giving up just two hits and striking out three.

Headline: Letter to the Editor
Subheadline: Non-christian, secular ideals should not be dismissed
Author: Jeff Joens / Professor / Chemistry Department
&nbsp;
I found the letter by Bill Harvelle (in response to a recent Opinion section piece by Adrian Diaz) to be quite interesting. He was upset at the claim that Christian beliefs are "absurd." However, he was unable to resist taking a shot at Scientology, calling its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, a "space cowboy."

I'm neither a Scientologist nor a Christian, so I can't say that I am personally offended by Harvelle's comment. However, I do think that if you are going to demand respect for your religious beliefs it is probably not a good idea to treat the beliefs of others with disrespect.

Harvelle also presents, in a somewhat corrupted form, the old C. S. Lewis trilemma argument, that Jesus must either have been a "liar, lunatic or Lord." The argument is flawed, as has been noted by many people since Lewis first advanced it.  

Harvelle states that Roger Boscovich is the "father of modern atomic theory," though most scientists would give that title to the English chemist John Dalton. In connection with this it is interesting to note that early atomic theories, based more on philosophical grounds than experimental evidence, were first developed by non-christian Indian and Greek thinkers such as Kanada, Katyayana and Democritus.  

Finally, the idea that John Locke and Thomas  Jefferson (as well as other enlightenment figures) made no significant contribution to the identification and advancement of human rights is simply silly, as is the implied claim that absent christianity the university would never have developed.

Headline: Churches provide boxed faith
Author: Ruth Barrocas / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Faith is, for the most part, something that is not experienced in a collective manner. The individual must experience it on their own, although at times, it can be said that working together to accomplish the maximizing of faith is something positive. Like love and friendship faith can be nurtured.

I believe that if something is too commercial, if too many people that are unknown to each other come together, then some of the personal value is lost in the crowd.

Mega-churches are churches that have more than 2,000 members. They tend to be of the Pentacostal or Evangelical faith. Most of these churches focus on large Protestant congregations of which there are over 1,200 in the United States. 

One of the more famous of these churches include that of Rev. Rick Warren - Saddleback church - in Orange County California, which is among the largest churches in the country.

The size of the church alone is not all there is to the mega-church. It must be seen for what it truly is, not so much a collective social phenomena rather than as an individual strange successful entrepreneurial venture.

Throughout history, many large congregations have existed through Christian history. Since the 1970's, however, these mega-churches have increased in numbers. Researchers believe that these huge houses of worship are a response to cultural changes, specifically the industrialization of areas. 

Also, the development of these churches is considered to have something to do with the societal views of urban and suburban areas.

This pre-packaged faith is nothing more then a simple marketing ploy in the way of religion. It's a way to get the masses to comply with a Unitarian form of thought, a form of thought that stifles whatever identity they are bringing to the table. It's another bland, colorless face in the crowd lost in the uneventful search for their souls. In smaller churches everyone knows your name. There is a homely feel to these places, the undeniable welcoming call of friends. This, I believe, is how a church should operate. 

As close as one is with the great entity, one should be with his or her brethren. A mass marketed faith is nothing but false friends and random general acquaintances.

Spirituality is something that can be acquired in many ways. Mass marketing faith, however, and abusing it for monetary function is not the path to righteousness but instead the path to what is sure damnation. 

Rather than look at this in the more religious way, in the purely realist aspect, it is a dangerous fondling of peoples' emotions and beliefs. I think, as our government has been separated from our religion, so shall our wallets from our faith.

Headline: Application turn-out for BBC election increases
Subheadline: UP candidate running unopposed
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
After almost two weeks of posters, banners and flyers, Vicky Owles, assistant director for Campus Life and Orientation, got what she was looking for: One of the highest number of applicants for the upcoming Student Government Association elections at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

At University Park, SGA Representative-at-Large Alfonso Leon is running unopposed for the presidential ticket with Providence Okoye, vice president of Student Organizations Council, as vice president. This shifts the competition to the Representative-at-Large position, for which there are six people runinng and only three positions to be filled. 

"This is a humbling experience, and [after] three years of hard work, many times SGA presidents are rembered for winning, but my fondest moment  will be when I look at all the goals I accomplish," Alfonso said.

Fourteen students turned in applications for various SGA positions on or before the March 10 deadline at BBC. 

"I think last year there were six [applicants]," Owles said. "We have every representative position [filled] except for two undergraduate, two lower division and one rep at large out of three." 

Owles and Edgar Izaguirre, the elections commissioner, promoted the various positions available by posting banners across the BBC library and Academic One building. 

"The fact that we have that many [applicants] is exciting," Owles said. "You have to market these positions in order to have an election, and then the election will happen."

Izaguirre and Larissa Adams, the student assistant for Campus Life, changed the banners that encouraged students to apply for SGA positions to banners that asked students to vote.  

"Hopefully more people will involve themselves on campus because I feel in a way that [BBC] has been abandoned, [but] hopefully this will raise some eyebrows," Izaguirre said.

Brent Maximin, the current SGA vice president at BBC and one of the applicants for the next term's vice presidency, agreed. 

"It's great because the more people run, the more people will turn out to vote … It forces everyone who is running for office to raise the bar," Maximin said.

SGA is planning a series of events that will allow students to familiarize themselves with the candidates and the issues they stand for. The first event is the Kick-Off Party in the Graham Center Pit and will take place March 27 from 12 p.m. until 2 p.m. Campaigning will begin March 29 with the Meet the Candidates debate in the GC Pit and will run through April 5.

This year's applicant turnout at the UP wasn't as high as before.

"It's the first time I can think of that we've ever had an unopposed president campaigning [at University Park ]," Owles said.

For Maximin the increase in applicants will change the way BBC is viewed.

"It shows that we don't have to be small in every aspect and we're not just the 'other' campus," Maximin said.

Owles predicts that there are certain positions that will make for tighter races. 

"The rep at large at UP will be the one to watch there and the vice-president and president [will be the ones to watch] at BBC," Owles said. 

And if student involvement continues to rise, she also predicts a bright future for the BBC SGA.

"I love representation for [BBC]. SGA will only get bigger and better if we get these positions filled," Owles said.

Youth Fair ride tested, four workers injured

During a safety test on the Mark I rollercoaster, four carnival workers were ejected from their seats, and two were air-lifted to the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital. 

The accident took place March 12 at approximately 10 a.m. when the rollercoaster derailed and launched the workers six feet to the ground. 

Three of the workers were sent home from the hospital the same night of the accident and one was in stable condition at the hospital. Three more workers who had also been ejected from the roller coaster refused medical assistance. According to Bernadette Kopacz, director of marketing for the fair, the Mark I rollercoaster will be removed and replaced by another ride. Inspectors from the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services will most likely not inspect the accident, but they will inspect other rides for safety before the fair opens.

Headline: Artist's work binds African culture
Author: Megan Wright / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Carriers of the Dream lecture held at the Biscayne Bay Campus's Wolfe University Center featured more than the display of guest artist Judith Salmon's works. 

It was a celebratory meeting hailing the achievements of Jamaican women and black women.

Judith Salmon's voice was low and her words few during the lecture on March 10.

"Her work is very profound and has a lot of voice … and it is coming out in the artwork," said Alicia Antone, assistant director of the African American Research Library and Cultural Center. 

Among the other decorated female panelists of Jamaican heritage were Heather Andrade and Donna Weir-Soley, assistant English professors to the African New World Studies program at FIU and Rosie Gordon-Wallace, curator of Diaspora Vibe Gallery in Miami. 

Sponsored by The African New World Studies department and emceed by Carole Boyce Davies, director of African New World Studies, this lecture also served to recognize and celebrate the stepping away of women from traditional roles handed to them by a patriarchal society. 

"We made this really special by recognizing the historic event that happened in Jamaica recently, the rise of women in traditionally male roles and their creativity and progress in Jamaica," Boyce Davies said.

In her presentation, Gordon-Wallace refute the words of a Jamaican folk song "brown skin gal stay home and mind baby," claiming it placed limits on women and marginalized them. 

She told women to continue to aspire to greater things just as Portia Simpson-Miller did when she rose to the rank of the first female Prime Minister of Jamaica Feb. 25, 2006.

Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Salmon's love for art developed in her teen years.

"I was smitten with the idea of being an artist after being guided in uncovering a talent for painting and drawing during my senior year," Salmon said. 

At 19 years old, Salmon left Jamaica to attend the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. 

She returned to Jamaica and taught art in rural schools. 

She started preparing for her solo exhibition in 1977; sixteen years later she had her solo exhibition at Grosvenor Gallery in Kingston. 

Simpson-Miller, though, took a non-traditional path to the top gaining most of her experience on-the-job, and was ridiculed by her detractors for her lack of educational credentials. 

She obtained a Bachelor's degree from the Union Institute, a distance learning institution in Miami, but it was from the streets of Jamaica and the political sphere where she claims to have obtained her Ph.D.

Her work represents continuity and the strength of women, according to Salmon. 

One of her signature pieces involves stitching and "represents picking up small things in life and covers personal inquiry, domestic women activity and my searching for the African space."

The lecture attracted both students, and faculty from FIU as well as residents of Broward and Miami-Dade Counties who were not just interested in art, but also in black cultural awareness and the advancement of women. 

"I like her use of fabric and, as a person of African descent, the way she incorporates nature and fabric could easily represent our heritage and the things that binds us together as a people," said junior Paris Clarke.

Headline: Board of Governors set to vote on medical school proposal
Author: C. Joel Marino / Content Editor
&nbsp;
The Florida Board of Governors is expected to cast its final vote on whether or not to approve FIU's medical school initiative on March 23, a decision University administrators say they've been anxiously anticipating for the last few years.

"This meeting will be one of the most historically important moments for FIU. If we are successful here, it will be the last piece of a long-worked-for puzzle," said Interim Provost Ronald Berkman.

Although the vote was originally supposed to be taken Nov. 17 of last year, various board members asked for an extension due to what they claimed was an insufficient amount of information in regards to the topic. Berkman states that he is positive a vote will be taken at this meeting, which will be held at Florida State University in Tallahassee.

"I think we've made the best case we could make, and this is it, this is when we finally get our results," he said.

FIU President Modesto A. Maidique has been presenting the University's reasons for the establishment of a medical school to the BOG since 2003.

According to Thomas Breslin, vice provost of academic affairs and one of the initiative's leaders, stated that Maidique's argument focused on the state-wide lack of physicians; the economic boost a medical school will bring to South Florida; the lack of minority representation in the medical field; and the opportunity low-income students will have to attend a public medical program in their region.

"After all the presentations, we've found that this proposal fits in with the governor's plan for economic development and has the support of the chamber of commerce and the Dade County Medical Association, and as a result the president has been able to make a very convincing argument," Breslin said.

However, the initiative has not been completely without opposition. BOG member Zach Zachariah - a foreign-trained doctor who is a member of the Nova Southeastern University Board of Trustees and clinical professor at the University of Miami - has consistently spoken against the establishment of new medical schools. His main arguments are that the shortage of physicians has been exaggerated and that if the claim were true, a better solution would be to expand residencies at existing programs. The administrators in charge of the initiative state they understand these arguments and have been able to counter them in past meetings.

"We have to accept the opposition as principled and in good faith," Breslin said. "The only way to respond is to try to come up with rational, logical, well-founded arguments to the contrary, then convey those arguments to the members of the board."

Since no presentations will be allowed during the meeting, the vote is expected to be announced in a quick manner, followed by a discussion which may include President Maidique and University of Central Florida's President John Hitt, who is also lobbying for an Orlando-based medical school.

"I think we're at a good stage right now. We're guardedly optimistic of the results, but optimistic nonetheless," Breslin said.

If the program is accepted, the proposal will then be submitted to the State Legislature, who will then pass it on to Governor Jeb Bush for final approval. According to both Berkman and Breslin, the University is aiming for a Fall 2008 opening class. 

Appropriate faculty and administrative heads (including a dean) would be hired before this time. A petition for medical school funds would be added to the FIU budget request next year, a process overseen by the State Legislature. Still, plans are also being made in the event that the proposal is not approved.

"If we're not approved at this meeting, we'll bring back the project to the board next year, and we'll continue to approach them until we succeed," Berkman said.

Although there is money currently reserved for the future program (including the $67 million grant given at the Nov. 17 meeting by FIU Board of Trustees member Herbert Wertheim), Berkman stated that all the funds will be returned to their donors if the school is not approved.

For now, administrators have been working on some last minute lobbying prior to the meeting,  with Maidique meeting with two BOG members within the last few days, whose names would not be  released to The Beacon.

"No matter what happens, I think medical education is going to remain on the board's agenda for the next 20 years," Breslin said. "This is an important issue and whether we get it or not, we'll have to face up to it eventually."

Headline: Former director compiles big band history
Author: Laura Jokisch / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The music style popularized by big bands was the first distinct American genre, a more appropriate soundtrack to a society characterized by cultural diversity than the classical music of Western Europe that had dominated the scene for a century. 

Jazz and its children - swing, funk, bebop and countless other fusions and subgenres - were the marriage of the music of Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and South and Central America. 

The new sound spread like wildfire; beloved by artists for its comparative lack of boundaries and an expressive nature that encouraged improvisation and creativity. It was a hit with the masses for its gaiety, which encouraged dance. 

For this reason, the big bands that provided the first definition of American music proved astonishingly resilient. While remembered by most as the music of the '30s and '40s, their reign lasted long enough to bear witness to both the sinking of the Titanic and the launching of atomic submarines. 

However, a number of decades later, now that the curtain has fallen on the era of the big bands, it is finally time to step back and applaud.  

FIU's former director of the arts, William F. Lee, has worked to ensure that the icons of yesteryear receive their due applause with America's Big Band, the first complete encyclopedia on the subject. 

For Lee, a multiple Pulitzer Prize and Grammy nominee, jazz has been a life long fascination. He played in several big bands in the late '50s and traveled with legend Maynard Ferguson in preparation for his biography "M. F. Horn: Maynard Ferguson's Life in Music." 

In compiling his latest work, he pulls from a lifetime of personal experiences and an impressive private library of 4,000 books on jazz and its offspring. Entries on each of the 650 big bands formed between the years 1900 and 2000 include an abridged history, years of existence, most influential and popular hits, a description of their style and biographical information on the musicians.

While the majority of provided information is skeletal, some interesting, if irrelevant, side notes break up the monotony - such as the fact that Louis Armstrong only discovered jazz after being arrested for shooting a gun in the streets and sent to the Colored Waifs Home for Boys, which featured a band that sparked his interest in the cornet. These snippets, along with six pages of intriguing quotes from the leaders of the big band era, breathe life into the characters of history. 

The chronological organization and decade separations arrange a hundred years of history into one coherent stream. Each section is preceded by an introduction serving as an overview of the changes within the genre during the covered period and a timeline of major global and national events that set the stage and present the discussion in proper context.

The book concludes with an analysis of the unsure future of big bands. Lee credits their decline to advances in technology, rather than changes in fashion or the evolution of music. 

Ironically, the developments in electronic sound quality and modern equipment that spawned and spread many new genres made the big band financially infeasible. There is no longer a need for large instrumental bands, making it impractical on an economic level to provide transportation and board for over a dozen musicians. 

They managed to survive a while longer through a fusion with "rock 'n' roll," played by sets of six to eight people rather than 16 to 18, but eventually the music form succumbed to television and the compact disc. 

As a whole, America's Big Bands has a surprising flow not usually associated with reference material and should prove an enjoyable and informative read for anyone. According to Lee in an interview with The Beacon, it's especially enjoyable for those who prefer an age when trumpet players were idols to a time infatuated with  "American Idol."

Subheadline: Gracie's, Rathskeller serve as getaway for students
Author: Zachary Duarte / Contributing Writer 
&nbsp;
Eavesdropping into an argument over what will take place in the final Harry Potter book and munching on some food while watching sports shows is only a part of the fun that takes place at Gracie's Grill and the Rathskeller located in the Graham Center at University Park. 

Most students who stop by are usually between classes in hopes for a decent lunch and just to hang out with friends to talk about current events ------- whether it is about movies, books, music or sports, which usually are playing on the overhead televisions. 

Other students study or do homework for their classes. 

"If I feel like not leaving [the University] and trying to find parking again, then I just come to Gracie's Grill, eat some lunch and watch what's on the TV," said freshman Brian Maldonado.

Gracie's Grill is a restaurant that caters to students who are craving some chicken fingers, quarter-pound burgers and wings among other foods. 

By night, it is a place that hosts different events, such as professional games for sport fans, or performances by local bands to help campus clubs raise money.

Unlike Gracie's Grill, the Rathskeller is not a restaurant, but a place for students to hang out whenever they wish.

The Rathskeller room has tables that students use to play cards, dominos and arcade games. The most dominant attraction of the Rathskeller is the large  TV that almost every student takes a peak at even if they're just passing through the room. 

However, you don't have to be a gamer or a sports fan to stop by the Rathskeller or Gracie's. Anyone can just drop by and enjoy the games being played by others in the Rathskeller or to see photos of current and former athletes, who have played for FIU, on Gracie's walls. 

"Usually [when] I'm on my way to Gracie's, I see all the students playing card games," said sophomore Tom Chambers. "I've never really been interested in playing them but it's interesting to see something different than laptops, school books and regular students talking about random gossip." 

Some students bring their Playstation, X-box or Nintendo Gamecube from home and play games on the bigscreen TV. 

"Most games [played] are fighting games such as 'Super Smash Brothers' and a lot of the games played are imported from out of the country," said freshman Xavier Cintron. 

Other games played include "Halo 2" and "Dead or Alive." With the exception of a few students who are studying or simply eating their food brought over from Gracie's Grill, most are engaging in some sort of gaming activity. 

Others play card games such as Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic: the Gathering.

"I enjoy the game Magic: the Gathering for its strategy and it helps kill time in between classes," said sophomore Danny Williams. 

For gamers, the Rathskeller is really a place they feel comfortable in.

"It's the place to be, it feels like home," said freshman Jose Torres.
