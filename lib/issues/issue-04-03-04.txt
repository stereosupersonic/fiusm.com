Subheadline: FIU students, faculty disagree on proposal to ban gay marriage

&nbsp;
President Bush's Feb. 24th speech, asking Congress to support his proposal to enact an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage has triggered mixed reactions among the FIU community.  

Views are spread across the spectrum. Some students and faculty are still trying to define what same-sex marriage is. 

Others, for religious reasons, are opposed to gay marriage. And a number of students express support for gay marriage.

The President's decision came after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's recent decision granting marriage rights to same-sex couples and Mayor Gavin Newsom's decision more than two weeks ago to issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples.

Bush's intention comes eight years after Congress passed the Defense Marriage Act. The Act defines the word 'marriage' which means only the legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.

"The union of a man and a woman is the most enduring human institution honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith," said Bush. 

The President of the Impact Movement, a branch of Campus Crusade for Christ, agrees with President Bush and believes that same-sex marriage is a sin. The FIU student explained that Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament in the Bible, says "from the beginning of time it doesn't say that marriage should be with a man and a man, it says marriage should be with a man and a woman. I find him to be very brave to step up and ban it. He is putting his words into actions."  

Martina M., a sophomore majoring in Education and a Jehovah's Witness exclaimed, "the Bible tells us that we know that God disapproves of homosexuality. That's why he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah," she said.

Asked why some people and the current administration are opposed to gay marriages, sociology Professor Ronald Stubbs explained that "because many people, especially those who are socially conservative, see same-sex marriage as a fundamental challenge to traditional notions of the institutions of the family and maybe as a legitimization of what they see as being a 'deviant' lifestyle." 

 He also added that the current administration happens to comprise some of the most extreme conservatives and questions who has the power to apply labels and enforce the meaning of marriage. 

"The country might be going to 'hell in a basket' in terms of socioeconomic factors, but they want to talk about who is allowed to get married. It's really very pathetic," said Stubbs.

Even though some people grew with conservative or religious values, some students, such as senior Admatha Israel, a psychology and political science major, believes that gay people should do whatever they want to do. 

"Growing up, Judeo-Christian values taught me that homosexuality is a sin, but it's just another form of hatred. I'm not gay, but what if I was? I wouldn't want someone hating me," Israel said.

Martina also noted that much of what we deemed unacceptable 20 years ago is prevalent today.

Almost 300 years ago African Americans were not allowed to marry until after the Civil War. According to sources, it was only 35 years ago that interracial couples were allowed to get married. 35 years later, same-sex couples are fighting for the same rights. 

President Bush said,  "unless action is taken, we can expect more arbitrary court decisions, more litigation, more defiance of the law by local officials, all of which adds up to uncertainty."

Bush added that the Defense of Marriage Act will not itself be struck down by activist courts. In that event, every state would be forced to recognize any relationship that judges in Boston and San Francisco choose to call a marriage.

However, Bush's views may or may not reflect the opinions held by FIU faculty and students.

One FIU history professor believes that these rights should be granted. "If activists push for rights, there will be a backlash, but ultimately they will triumph."

 What is known is that gay and lesbian couples from more than 20 states have lined up outside their city halls in a public challenge to President's Bush's comments against gay marriage. 

According to the Associated Press, at least 38 states and the federal government have approved laws and amendments banning the recognition of gay marriage. Florida is one of them.

Roberto Rebosso, manager of Marriage License Bureau of Dade County, said that gay couples came down to the courthouse to get married even before Bush's protest, but Florida doesn't recognize same-sex marriage and (employees) have to follow within the statures and state laws. 

Sophomore Renee John Williams, an International Business major said that the legislation should promote equal rights for everyone. "States should not dictate who should be married," Williams said.

Chelsea Boehme, President of Stonewall Pride Alliance, a gay and lesbian club, also believes the state is standing in the way of people's rights. 

"It's kind of ridiculous that in 2004, gay people can't get tax and insurance benefits that straight married couples do." At first she believed that South Florida is liberal because it has a large gay population. Recent events changed her mind. 

"The State of Florida is more conservative. Clearly it is a very anti-gay state," said Boehme.  Jorge Casas, President of Beta Delta, a gay fraternity, believes that gay marriage should not be looked at as a special right but as an equal right. Casas said that for many years, the gay community has battled stereotypes of promiscuity and inability to maintain monogamous relationships. Casas wants the community to break what he says is "a terrible, false stereotype."

"We are asking to be recognized just as other relationships are recognized. I believe gay marriage is a matter of equality. Denying this basic freedom to 10 percent of the population takes away a basic American principle and that is the pursuit of happiness."

Boehme claimed that until you have friends  who are gay, you really don't understand the gay person's perspective.

Feb. 24 - No. 7 Michigan 3, FIU 1

The Golden Panthers lost their fifth consecutive game of the season Feb .24 to the 7th-ranked Michigan Wolverines at University Park. The 3-1 loss was the 10th of the season, dropping FIU's record to 2-10.

Amanda Nealer took the mound for the Golden Panthers, going the distance and picking up five strikeouts along the way. She was credited with the loss after allowing three runs (two earned) on seven hits to the non-conference visitors. Nealer (0-4) has been unable to pick up a victory this season after going 21-9 with a 1.92 ERA in 2003.

Lorilyn Wilson and Jennie Ritter combined for nine strikeouts for the Wolverines, picking up their second win and first save, respectively. FIU's offense, stagnant so far this season, came up with just two hits and one run on the night.

Michigan opened the scoring early when first baseman Jennifer Olds popped up to right field scoring Tiffany Haas from third on a sacrifice fly. Olds picked up another RBI in the third on a single to center. FIU's '02 MVP, Jacque Vetters, bobbled the ball allowing Meghan Doe the trip home from second on a fielding error.

FIU pulled to within one run in the third off Deomni Murray's RBI single, which scored Turek from third. Wilson responded by fanning her next two batters. The Wolverines added the last run of the game in the seventh inning when Olds picked up her third RBI of the night to give her squad a 3-1 lead. FIU's Kristen Perry, Cindy Turek and Tabitha Embry went three-up, three-down to end the game.

Feb. 27 - FIU 9, Stony Brook 0

Senior Kendra Laminack (3-3) pitched a complete-game, two-hit shutout and struck out seven batters to help FIU (3-10) break a five-game losing streak with a 9-0 win over Stony Brook at the Golden Panther Adidas Invitational.

Senior Jennifer Owens and junior Marleah Stapf each went 3-for-5 to lead the Golden Panthers offensively.

Feb. 27 - Maryland 5, FIU 1

FIU lost the second game of Friday's doubleheader, 5-1, to the Maryland Terrapins. Sophomore Nicole Barrett (0-4) allowed five runs in two innings and the Panthers picked up only one run when Deomni Murray stole home in the first. 

FIU fell to 3-11 with the loss.

Feb. 28 - Michigan State 2, FIU 1

Laminack (3-4) and Barrett allowed only two runs in six innings, but Turek's run in the seventh inning was not enough as FIU (3-12) fell to Michigan State, 2-1.

Feb. 28 - FIU 5, Maryland 0

Nealer (1-4) picked up her first win of the season with a complete-game, four-hit shutout, defeating Maryland, 5-0, to advance to the championship game of the Adidas Invitational.

Nealer added 10 strikeouts and freshman Brittany Witherow had three RBI to lead FIU (4-12).

Feb. 29 - Michigan State 3, FIU 2 (Eight innings)

Laminack (3-5) allowed an RBI single in the bottom of the eighth as FIU lost the championship game of the Adidas Invitational to the Spartans, 3-2.

Feb. 27 - FIU 7, UM 9

After knocking off the 'Canes the night before, FIU players said it would mean nothing if they didn't repeat the feat on Friday night. 

They gave their best effort to upset the 4th-ranked University of Miami Hurricanes, but fell short, in a 9-7 loss in Homestead. 

"We knew we had to stay with the same mentality as yesterday. We didn't expect them to just sit back," centerfielder Dennis Diaz said.

UM didn't sit back, erupting for seven runs in the first three innings, six of them off FIU starter Denny Hernandez (1-1), who allowed five hits and issued three walks in only two innings.

But the FIU offense responded, getting a run in the first and two more in the second. P.J. Lehmann's RBI single in the second cut UM's lead to 4-3.

Miami fought off FIU's pressure and extended its lead after a three-run homerun by catcher Erick San Pedro, making the score 7-3. 

After an RBI groundout by Luis Rivera (1-for-5, three RBIs) in the fourth, Cody Jacobs' two-run double in the fifth cut UM's lead to just one, 7-6.

But UM finished FIU off in the seventh when right fielder Brendan Katin drilled a two-run shot off FIU reliever Ammer Cabrera, increasing UM's lead to 9-6.

"We had a lot of key situations we didn't take advantage of," Diaz said.

The loss dropped FIU's record to 5-8, while improving UM's to 5-3.

Feb. 28 - Villanova 9, FIU 3

A night after falling to the 4th-ranked Hurricanes, FIU fell to Villanova, 9-3, at University Park.

"I think everybody used a lot of energy against Miami. I think we definitely underestimated them," Jacobs said.

Adrian Casanova's RBI groundout in the second inning gave FIU an early 1-0 lead, but that wouldn't last for long. FIU pitcher Mark Worrell (1-4) allowed seven runs in the third inning, highlighted by Brian Newbold's two-run double. Worrell lasted just 2.2 innings and allowed six hits and issued four walks.

"We're not being very consistent.  We are still trying to find our team's spark," Diaz said. 

 Jacobs retaliated with a two-run homer in the sixth, but it wasn't enough. 

"It was kinda bitter-sweet to have that homerun, but it definitely doesn't feel as good without a win," Jacobs said. 

Feb. 29 - FIU 11, BC 9

FIU snapped a two-game losing streak Sunday, defeating Boston College 11-9 at University Park.

Starting pitcher Andrew Edwards (2-0) dominated the Eagles. 

He allowed only six hits, four runs and struck out four batters in 6.1 innings of work.  

"After the game against Villanova, we knew we didn't want another loss, so we came out pumped," Jacobs said.

FIU took a quick 3-0 lead on an RBI double by first baseman Michael Lopez and added another run on Fernando Alvarez's solo shot in the third.

Diaz hit a solo homerun in the fifth and Jacobs added a two-run shot in the sixth to put FIU up 10-3. Reliever Danny Hernandez gave up three runs in the seventh, but was able to hold on for the win.

"You gotta come out every game with the same attitude and forget about what ranked team you are playing," Jacobs said.

Headline: Marsh remains ambiguous about basketball's future
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the 2003-04 season nearly over, the big question is whether head coach Donnie Marsh will return to coach the Golden Panthers for his fifth year next season. Marsh's career record at FIU stands at 31-82 and suspensions have haunted the team during his tenure. 
This season, the team dismissed forward Taurence Johnson from the squad for violating team rules. Johnson was supposed to be the cornerstone of the program when he was brought here three years ago, but multiple suspensions tainted his FIU career.
In addition, fan support has been sub-par and the team has fallen to 5-21 on the season. 

The Beacon sat down with Marsh to discuss the suspensions, fan support and his future at FIU.

Q: A couple of weeks ago, Johnson was quoted in The Miami Herald saying that he was kicked off the team due to allegations that a routine drug exam test came back positive. He stated that he never failed a drug test and that it was an excuse to dismiss him. What's the truth behind the story?

A: Well first of all, I am not allowed to comment on that because of the Buckley Amendment and so forth, and that's really the difficult thing about an article like that, because he can say whatever it is he wants to say but we can't really respond because of the law. I will just say this, that anybody that came to our games and watched us at practice and workouts over the past two years, I just think some things kind of speak for themselves. As a coach you do anything you can to put players out on the floor to give you an opportunity to win games and in doing that, you ask for everybody to go by the same rules and regulations in our program.

Q: Prior to his dismissal, Johnson was suspended three times and recently Morban was suspended for a couple of games. Have all these suspensions gotten the team out of focus and been detrimental to their season?

A: Sure they hurt. There's no question they hurt. I wouldn't say they don't because you strive for continuity and consistency and trying to develop chemistry between groups. When you have a guy for a couple of games and then you don't have another one for a couple and it continues that way, sure it's disruptive. What we try to do is to maintain something constant and you hope you have leadership between your program that can continue to pull guys together and keep people together. One of the biggest issues for us has been the lack of leadership and that's a direct reflection of not having Junior Matias, who I believe has been our heart and soul.

Q: FIU has never been known for the basketball program and fans don't generally line up to fill the arena for basketball games. Do you feel that this hurts the university recruiting wise?

A: No...I will say this and I won't hide from it: We clearly have not done our part because we have to win games. I know young people want to play in front of people and I know how hard our kids work, and I think they deserve to have people out in the stands cheering for them. We have a core group of very loyal people who are there night in and night out and I'm very happy about that. But for a youngster coming out to a place, you want to be able to come out through those doors and feel an atmosphere. I believe other schools use that against us in recruiting, that we don't draw and our attendance hasn't been too good. It's something that we know and the department has been trying to generate more fan base, but we haven't done our part and if you are not winning, they don't show up.

Q: Will coach Marsh return next season?

A: It's difficult to answer and it's not all coach Marsh's decision, and we all know that. Do I feel as if we have done some things that have pushed our program in the right direction? Yes. Am I disappointed that we haven't won more games to this point? No question I'm disappointed. At the end of every season, Athletic Director Rick Mello and I sit down and assess where our program is and where it's heading, and at that point we'll both be able to address what the future might be.

Q: Next year returning will be Marcus Robinson, Raphael daSilva, Carlos Morban, Byron Burnett and Harry Lum, all of whom have started at one point this season. This year was the year of taking the losses, but next year they will all come in with more experience. Do you feel as if given the opportunity to return, this team can win?

A: Do I think that with the kids we have that are coming in and the kids that will be returning that we can turn it around to the point of having success? Yes, I believe we can. Robinson, Burnett, Lum and daSilva were all first year players and we really didn't have a continuity of guys really returning and having been through the wars of what's expected. Without question we will make ourselves a lot more competitive next year with a chance to get this thing in the direction we want to go.

Q: Despite the losses and basketball environment here at FIU, your recruiting classes have always been considered talented and often recognized nationally. How is recruiting going for next season?

A: We have two very good high school seniors. One kid, he's an All-State player, Kenny Sims, who's from New Jersey and he recently got a letter as a McDonald's All-American Nominee. The other is Stephon Griffin over at Pace who is playing in the district final. He's a point guard and we obviously like him coming because he's been well-coached and understands what it takes to win. We still have two scholarships to give and with these additional two, we need to bring two impact guys in. There's no question that these next two guys need to be impact people.

Q: Junior Matias played in only six games this season. Despite this being his senior year, he talked about redshirting the season. Will he be back next season?

A: He played the maximum numbers you can play and still be able to redshirt. We're in the process now of discussing that and move forward to give him the chance to file paperwork and redshirt. Obviously, that would be very big for us if he can return.

Q: Despite the record, what have been the positive points for the team this season?

A: It's been in a lot of ways a tough year for us, and I know this has not been the kind of year the fans have wanted, and certainly not the year I wanted. There's no question about that. 
I think when you look at different things about our program in terms of how kids are doing academically; we've done some good things. It takes time and the big question is how much time. 
That's not a question I can answer at this point. That's left to other people. I'll say this much: My coaching staff and myself are really pushing it hard to bring impact guys in here that are going to make a difference and in the way we want to be heading.

Headline: Marriage does not solve gay equal rights issues
Author: Eduardo Kouri Baquiero/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
There was a person who wanted to change the world. Without success, he tried to change his country. After a year, he decided to change his town, but finally, he just tried his neighborhood. All he did turned out a failure. 

Then he thought to do the opposite. He first changed himself and then he changed his family. This opened the doors to change the neighbors and so on.

If you want to change the world, first start changing your family and you may have success. What makes families the key to transforming people? The families are the smallest institutions that in groups create what we call society. Societies become towns and towns make up our country.

A good, healthy society is built from good, healthy families. Those that encourage kids to study, elect responsible government representatives, build up economy, have opinions which allow laws and reject them, create the behavior standard of the city, take care of relatives, give birth to new generations, teach values and create more important decisions. 

Family is the nuclei of values that societies develop daily. The sacred aspect of it is to bring new life in natural form. It supplies society with new generations to support the older.

Understanding the importance of the family cycle, we can open the discussion of the homosexual petition to get married. This is a big deal because it would change society as we know it, and may affect you in one way or another. 

Homosexual persons are as human as straight persons are, as capable as straight persons are, and in fact they have achieved better recognition in some areas than straight. Everybody must respect them and listen to their grievances.

Although homosexual groups have the right to demand marriage, they must realize that they are asking for something illogical and unnecessary for them, considering the real meaning of marriage. 

Instead of debating about whether homosexuals should get married, we should ask what they really want with it: Do they want it to prove more love? Do they want it to get more respect and acceptance? Do they want to taste divorce legally? Is it just a desire or caprice? Do they want it to be legally bonded and be able to have rights with the other person as husbands and wives do? 

Homosexuals live a free status in our society and have a highly advertised acceptance in the media. I do not know how much more they want to push the envelope, but they are a strong movement nowadays  and want to impact even more.

Marriage is more than a contract. Almost all nations use it to bond a man and a woman in society. Marriage develops many rights and compromises, but the main issue of marriage is the family union of a man and woman for life to give birth to new generations for the nation. 

These small institutions give prosperity to our society and would eventually guide the society in the future. Marriage contracts have other privileges that may not be inside the meaning of a family union, but were attached to it by the nation and this is what homosexuals are asking for. 

They want to be recognized as a couple, they want to be able to decide the future of one another's fate after death and enjoy the heritage that both built. They want to enjoy many privileges that married couples enjoy. 

Maybe there is a need to create a new contract for these individuals to recognize this status. 

Families are the basis for society's prosperity. Families create more families and those create more so the society grows. 

A homosexual family cannot give new generations, it would be like a cancer to the nation because it would die without creating a new nucleus for future life. 

Imagine a society that cannot provide future generations, the ones existing would get older and the population would decline. 

These types of societies are fated to disappear. There is a saying: humans and God always forgive, but nature never does. 

Next time you hear a discussion about homosexual marriage, ask them what marriage is and what do they want it for. If we forget the meaning of family, we can hurt our society badly. Marriage is not about just a contract, it is about life in our healthy society.
