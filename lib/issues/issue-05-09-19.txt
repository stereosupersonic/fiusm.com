Headline: Teammates admire offensive lineman for toughness
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
There's a reason why center Victor Cernius has been named the Golden Panther's football team Iron Man for two consecutive years. With a 6-4, 290 pound frame, the third year center has started every game for FIU in his career.

Cernius has been a focal point of the offensive line and is rated as the No. 32 center in Division I by Phil Steele's 2005 College Football Preview. In 2003, the lineman finished with 755 snaps and no penalties called against him.

Coming out of Tampa Catholic High School with a school record 1,085 pound leg press, Cernius dominated the prep league with offensive MVP honors his senior year and by participating in the All-Hillsborough Country all-star game. In high school, he was also a member of the National Honors Society and a Bright Futures Scholar.

Q: What can fans expect from the football team this year after two disappointing seasons?

From the fans' perspective, they don't see what we see. We are expecting a tougher competition, but from us, fans can expect much more leadership and commitment. We should be able to close out games and have a chance at the Sun Belt Championship.

Q: Everyone knows coach Don Strock, the football player and coach. What type of person is he when football is not involved?

He's a very laid - back person and a nice guy. He's also always dressed in golf attire.

Q: How have you been able to start and play in every game for the past three seasons?

I guess I've been lucky - I haven't gotten hurt. Me and some other guys also spend more time in the weight room. Maybe that helps with injuries.

Q: What's a typical workout at the gym for you?

All season I lift four days a week, but in season I lighten the load. I can bench 400 pounds max and 27 times at 225 pounds. I squat 550 pounds.

 Q: People don't know the beating your arms, fingers and legs take during a football game. How does your body feel the day after a game?

Every part of your body hurts after a game and your hands definitely get a beating. Physically, I wear gloves to minimize cuts, I don't wear gloves in my right hand 'cause I snap the football and that hand is scared up. By the end of the season, I have pieces of my hand missing. 

Q: You were on the university's dean list last semester. How important is it for you to not only excel on the field but also in the classroom?

It's the most important to me; football will always be there but that degree will set you up for the rest of your life.

Q: Linemen are typically known to eat massive amounts of food - more than the usual football player. What's the craziest amount of food you and your teammates have eaten?

The second year I was here, the entire offensive line went to Kings Buffet (Chinese place). We went there around seven and pretty much closed the place down by ourselves. I've never seen faces like that of the people that were there. We cleaned the place out.

Q: In high school, you held the record with a leg press of 1,085 pounds. What motivates you to do this kind of weight?

It's important to me, I just compete against myself. If  I don't hit what I should in the weight room, I get disappointed in myself.

Q: If your house was on fire and you could only go back and get three material things - assuming your family is safe - what would you get?

Probably a photo album and my computer because it has lots of schoolwork there and some clothes I guess, 'cause I would probably need some.

Q: Would you shed three years of your life for an NCAA title with FIU?

Yes because that's what I've dreamed of since [I was] little. I would do it without a question.

Q: What are the best and worst things of FIU?

The best is probably the diversity the university has. The bad is that the university is not mature for its size. FIU is constructing so much stuff so quickly. The campus looks totally different than when I got here. I can't imagine the university being able to run everything so fast.

Q: The team travels on a charter plane to every game. What's the best part of traveling with all your teammates together?

The thing I like best is the focus we have as a team. From the time we are on the bus to the airport, to when we arrive to the city we are going to play at, the mentality is all football. 

The worst thing about it, though, is the small seats on the plane. I'm a big guy so the small seats on a long ride are not too good.

Headline: Captain overcomes setbacks
Author: Gabriel Medina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Senior Nastassia Rodriguez, a center midfielder and captain of the women's soccer team, believes that life is all about the obstacles you face, and the lessons you learn from them. 

Rodriguez began playing soccer at the age of 11 and has been a steady player and student ever since. 

Two major soccer-related injuries have plagued her since the start of high school.

As a freshman in high school, Rodriguez had surgery on her right knee. 

"That was my first surgery," she said. "The doctors told me that I would be back [to normal] eight weeks [after the surgery]. I got back in six and started for the varsity team as a freshman. That was a very big accomplishment."

Rodriguez had surgery on her left ear a few years later, which left her 75 percent deaf in that ear. 

"These experiences have opened my eyes a lot," Rodriguez said. 

Despite this, Rodriguez said she has been able to keep her faith. As her father Felipe, 46, said: "Things happen in life that we don't understand. It's important [for us] to keep faith in God."

Though many people told her not to push herself too hard for fear that she would injure herself further, Rodriguez remained persistent. 

"I can get injured just as much while driving a car down the street. Why not do what I love?" she said.

By her own admittance, Rodriguez isn't the star player of the soccer team. However, the girl who drives around in a bulky Ford F350 has a unique form of motivation.

"My best friend passed away when I was 16," Rodriguez said. "She taught me to live life while you can because it's too short." 

Maria Kassab, Nastassia's friend, was diagnosed with cancer when the two were 12-years-old. 

Felipe Rodriguez played soccer when he was younger and enlisted his daughter at the Coral Gables Youth Center when she was 11 years old. Nastassia has not regretted it one bit. 

"I'm the soccer player that I am today because soccer [was almost] taken away from me," she said. "I've had a lot of injuries that have opened my eyes and made me see that soccer is a privilege that allows you to use your body [competitively]. It's a privilege to be able to run and pass."

Rodriguez has a love for many things other than soccer. 

"She enjoys racing, as do I and her brother, Felipe, Jr. [Nastassia and her brother] drive really fast! [Nastassia] has always been a strong-willed girl," said her father.

Rodriguez called herself a "stable student athlete." She currently maintains a 3.0 cumulative GPA. 

"It's tough maintaining [my grades] because of athletics," she said. "Student athletes have ... a rigorous schedule." 

Rodriguez also joked that she has become a pro in time management.

"Nastassia [was] in the gifted program in elementary school, middle school and high school," her father said. 

She made the varsity soccer team during her freshmen year at Coral Gables Senior High School and helped the Cavaliers to four district championships, two GMAC titles, a pair of regional championships and to a state runner-up finish in 2000. 

During the fall semester of 2002, Rodriguez attended Appalachian State University on a soccer scholarship, but transferred to FIU in order to be closer to her family.

The 21-year-old center midfielder is currently studying international business, but admitted that she did not know what she wanted to do with the degree. 

"[All I know] is that whatever I do in life, I'm going to be happy," Rodriguez said. "If tomorrow I feel like going to Europe, then I'm going to go."

Despite her resolute nature, Felipe Rodriguez does not worry about his daughter. He and wife Veronica allowed Nastassia to make her own decisions as she was growing up so that she would learn the consequences of making wrong choices early in life.

"Life is just a big school year," Nastassia Rodriguez said. "Life is full of experiences and that's what makes you who you are." 

Just as no one was worried about Rodriguez when the subject turned to education, no one seems to worry about her when it comes to the rest of her life. Because whatever happens to her, she is always prepared to learn.

Headline: Forward raised around soccer
Author: Gabriel Medina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Passionate soccer lovers constantly surround senior Chris Megaloudis, a forward for the men's soccer team. Those same die-hards can be found sleeping under the same roof as him.

His father, Nick Megaloudis, and stepfather, Thomas Rongen, have been involved with soccer since before Chris was born. In recent years, Nick has been an assistant coach for Major League Soccer's Miami Fusion, while Rongen has coached teams like 1999 MLS Championship team DC United and Chivas.

Gael Rongen, Megaloudis's mother, has also been involved with the game for a long time. Gael had been a professional photographer for Major League Soccer for quite some time, and contributed to Chris's love for soccer.

"I didn't have a choice [when I first played soccer]," said Megaloudis. "My entire family has been around the game for so long that it sort of grew on me." 

It is rare to see an American family with such a strong love for soccer. Soccer, at least in the United States, is often overshadowed by sports such as football, baseball, basketball and hockey. But, throughout the years, Megaloudis and his family have not cared for what other Americans think of soccer.

"My first present was from my uncle Mike," said Megaloudis. "It was a soccer ball."

However, it has not been a smooth ride for Megaloudis throughout his collegiate career. 

When he attended the University of Virginia, he was promised a lot of playing time. According to Megaloudis, the coaches never kept their promises, but he kept quiet.

At one point, Megaloudis injured his ankle and required surgery. Soon thereafter, his former coaches red-shirted him and Megaloudis made his way back to South Florida, where he spent most of his childhood.

"I think leaving [the University of Virginia] was good for both [the coaches and I]," Megaloudis said. "It gave me the opportunity to see more playing time, and it gave the coaches an opportunity to maintain the prestige of their program." 

At the time, the University of Virginia had one of the top five soccer programs in the nation.

Tragedy hit the Megaloudis family when Chris's sister - a member of a national soccer team, which was traveling to Europe - passed away unexpectedly.

"Sometimes, you can still see that he doesn't concentrate on the game," said coach Karl Kremser. "It's hard because gloom seems to descend on you whenever it isn't wanted."

Kremser is familiar with the feeling his starting forward is going through.

"When I was about his age, my brother was killed in an accident," Kremsler said. "I know he will never forget about his sister and never stop loving her, but life does go on."

Megaloudis said that Kremser has been one person he has been able to confide in during his time at FIU.

"Coach Kremsler has been like a father figure to me," Megaloudis said. "Although we don't always see eye to eye on many things, you just got to have faith in him."

Megaloudis is currently double majoring in sociology and sports management. He has no aspiration to play soccer professionally, but wants to stay involved with the sport. He has already planned a career with Sports Net, which he plans to spend most of his life working for.

As far as family, Megaloudis said that whenever he has kids, they will have a choice as to whether or not to play soccer.

"I think it will be in their blood," he said. "I say that now, but I have a feeling I'll end up forcing them."

At this point, Megaloudis smiled, thinking about the game that has been a part of his family and a part of his life for so long.

Subheadline: Student exchange program not only for international students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
     Many students wonder what makes FIU international and the answer can be found through the International Student Exchange Program. Students have a tendency to complain about the inefficiencies on campus, often neglecting the programs of merit this school has to offer - ISE being one of them. 

     The number of students coming into FIU from other countries needs to be the same number of students going out, and because of low amounts of students wanting to study elsewhere, the university has had to stop the number of students coming in. More students should take advantage of the opportunities to study abroad. FIU is a commuter school and a great portion of the population works and goes to school, which may be part of the reason the number of ISE students has gone down. However, for those who do not work outside of school, the program would be a great option. 

     ISE students pay FIU tuition anywhere they decide to go and scholarships are also available. The international experience itself challenges students mentally and culturally. Furthermore, the ability to adapt to a foreign environment requires intelligence and will power. Studying abroad is the ultimate learning experience, not only does the student receive an education, but he also learns to think critically and develops analytical skills when placed in a country where people speak a different language, have different customs and eat different foods. 

     After college, most students won't have the opportunity to take a couple of months of their lives to go somewhere they have never been to before because they'll be landing their first job or internship. So, if students don't take the chance to study abroad now, they might be passing up the chance of a lifetime.

Headline: Embryonic stem cells spark controversy
Author: Christopher Necuze / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Few things in this world elude us more than the cure for cancer. Our reach as a species has never been wider, nor has our knowledge of the world around us and its mechanisms. Yet, the day is still to come when being diagnosed with cancer is not a big deal - the day when a simple pill or shot will do the trick.  

The same can be said about hundreds, if not thousands, of other debilitating and deadly diseases that inhabit our world and prey on our bodies.

At the forefront of the hunt for a cure are stem cells. Stem cells are basically cells that have the potential to form into any type of tissue within the body.  Theoretically, they can divide infinitely while the person or animal is still alive, replacing those cells which have died or are damaged.  

Traditionally, there are two basic types of stem cells: Those that are embryonic and those that are non-embryonic (more commonly known as adult stem cells). An adult stem cell is an undifferentiated cell found in the midst of the differentiated cells of a tissue or organ. These stem cells, found in all the organs and tissues of the body, can yield all of the different types of cells for a specific tissue or organ.  

Unfortunately, embryonic stem cells are not limited to a specific organ or tissue; they can develop into every one of the 300 or so types of cells in the body. Embryonic stem cells must be derived from fertilized embryos, and herein lies the controversy.    

While adult stem cells can be found in virtually all parts of the body, fertilized human embryos must be destroyed in order to yield embryonic stem cells. In 2001, President Bush became the first president ever to grant federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. Ironically enough, this fact was overlooked by the media and Democrats alike, who had a feeding frenzy and claimed that the president had banned stem cell research altogether. The reality was that the president's policy allowed for research on embryonic stem cells without trampling over ethics laws, specifically the Dickey Amendment of 1955, which forbade the funding of research on human embryos.  

 So what's the deal with these embryonic stem cells?  Stem cells have a very promising future, but it is important to separate fact from fiction and hype from science. It is important not to buy into the false hope surrounding this technology, which is still in its infancy.  

Media has painted stem cells, particularly embryonic stem cells as a quick fix to the world's most horrid medical maladies. In fact, the only types of stem cells that are being put to any good use right now are adult stem cells.  People tend to ignore that, for about 30 years now, adult stem cells have successfully treated over 100 medical conditions. 

Even while advances in adult stem cell technology are overlooked, new research indicates that the once deified embryonic stem cells may actually cause more harm than good. Recent breakthroughs suggest that embryonic stem cells might actually accrue genetic mutations over time that can eventually become tumors.  

In China, where embryonic stem cells were injected into a patient's brain, his symptoms improved temporarily. Within two years, however, the cells began to multiply into different types of human tissue like bone, skin and hair.  That patient died.

On the political front, the Specter-Harkin bill has introduced legislation that will permit federally funded scientists to extract stem cells from human embryos that have been donated by fertilization clinics.  

The ethics of this is another article entirely, but what of its necessity?  

With science moving forward so quickly, proving more and more everyday that success may lie in the field of adult stem cells, rather than embryonic, is the Specter-Harkin bill really necessary anymore?  

Must we go so far to prove that something does not work?  In my opinion, until embryonic stem cell research can claim a noteworthy success to its name, our focus and our funds must go to the field which is getting results.  

Get off the embryonic band and get with the program that is actually curing diseases.

Headline: Departments offer educational travels
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Around 15 students stand on a hill as they observe the mist wrap around the large town below them, the glow of a steady sunrise at their backs. Even though all of them are FIU students, they are not in Miami. They are standing by the walls of a hundred-year-old monastery in Genoa, Italy, their place of residency as they take part in a School of Architecture study abroad program.

"The scenery they have from their living quarters is amazing," said Christine Jarchow, director of the Office of International Studies. "The monastery, Santa Maria di Castello, is also close to the University of Genoa, where they take their classes, so they manage to live in a great area where they can also live what they're studying."

According to Jarchow, FIU is currently the only American university to be teaching classes in Genoa. The program, a joint venture between the OIS and the School of Architecture, was founded recently and has proven to be a great success.

"Applicants realize that now is the time to take advantage and travel, before they're weighed down by post-graduate responsibilities, so they recognize it's a chance that may not come around too often," she said.

There are currently 27 active department-specific study abroad programs sponsored by different FIU colleges. What separates these special programs from other OIS traveling ventures such as student-exchange, is that classes are taught by FIU faculty in English and credits can be applied toward that department's requirements for a major.

"The participants also get to interact with students from the university they're studying at, so there's a lot of cultural exchange taking place within the classroom itself," Jarchow said.

Another newly established program is the Honors College's Trinidad and Tobago trip, set to officially begin in spring 2006.

"We've been working on this for some time, and we're excited that we can add a full semester program to our current list of study abroad options," said Elizabeth Williams, director of college relations for the Honors College.

Though the college currently sponsors summer trips to Italy, Spain and Jamaica, the Trinidad program will be the first to take place during the course of a full term, lasting from January to May.

Each course deals with subjects such as architecture for Italy, history for Spain, culture and environmentalism with Jamaica and Trinidad, though the credits can substitute one year of classes for Honors College students. Those not belonging to the college must have their credits approved by an adviser from their respective school.

"The programs fulfill the Honors College's goal to offer students an interdisciplinary education. Each of the four programs offers a unique opportunity for students to study cultures they may not necessarily be familiar with," Williams said.

Students interested in these programs pay regular FIU tuition for the classes, though extra fees for residency, meals, mandatory insurance and airfare usually spike up the prices.

Trinidad and Tobago, the most expensive option offered by the Honors College, has an extra fee of $4,940 because of its added length. The least expensive class in Jamaica, holds an additional charge of $1,600. This trip, however, lasts only a week.

"We understand how expensive they may seem, but none of the programs are really profitable for the college. We just break even each year. We charge students just enough to pay for the necessities," Williams said.

Despite the growing prices, Williams maintains the programs (which are allowed to take up to 15 students per trip) continue to be successful - 363 students having participated since the first trip to Italy began 12 years ago.

"I always encourage whoever comes into my office to do this now, if you have the opportunity to do a study abroad program, any type of study abroad, because once you graduate, other things may take priority: Marriage, a job, anything," she said.

With the success of the recent Genoa trip, the School of Architecture is currently planning to open an interior design program for 2006.

Other programs in the works include language courses in China and Brazil and a South American studies program in Argentina, all in conjecture with the College of Arts and Sciences.

The deadline for program applications is Oct. 15. For more information on other department study abroad options, prices and scholarship information, students are encouraged to visit ois.fiu.edu.

Headline: Honors college commited to increase enrollment
Author:  Karen Buitrago / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Honors College is getting ready to expand at the Biscayne Bay Campus as overall enrollment in the college is expected to grow 20 percent.

During the 2004-2005 school year, the Honors College had 1,046 students, with 951  located at the University Park campus and 95 located at BBC, according to Ivelaw Griffith, dean of the Honors College.

However, for the 2005-2006 school year, 854 more students applied to the Honors College, 16 percent more than in the previous year.

"We admitted 644 of them; 98 percent of them accepted the terms of admissions. We don't expect all 628 to enroll. However, even if only 95 percent enroll, the Honors College will grow, making the total close to 1,150," Griffith said.

The predictions are made based on the record of students who attend orientation both at UP and BBC and a database that monitors the number of students who enroll in classes and the number of returning students who enroll in classes, according to Larissa Ramos, coordinator of Student Services and External Relations for the Honors College.

The predictions are not only beneficial for the Honors College as a whole but also for the smaller-sized BBC, where Honors College enrollment is historically low because of the limited number of classes and the lack of full-time Honors faculty, according to Ramos.

"BBC enrollment is lower than at UP, but we're hoping that expansion of our pre-collegiate program and our IB academy to BBC from next year and increased recruitment in Northern Miami-Dade and Southern Broward [Counties] will change this," Griffith said.

The Office of Admissions is responsible for recruiting students throughout the university. 

The Honors College supplements their effort by giving students orientations and additional information about the college and by doing follow-ups.

The Honors College administration agreed that they are committed to increasing enrollment at BBC.

"We're [creating] a housing living community, we've hired a faculty fellow to answer library research questions, we're creating special activities [both for students and faculty] and we're working very closely with the leadership at BBC," said Lesley Northup, associate dean of the Honors College. "We are adding more faculty and courses. These changes are ongoing."

The current president for the Honors Society at BBC, Jerzy Brodzikowski, who has been in charge for four months, is very enthusiastic about the program, according to Northup.

"Size doesn't matter. Our society, even though smaller, has the same potential as the one in UP. [We've chosen] to cooperate and work together next semester. Both Alpha Sigma Tau and Gamma Epsilon Phi are united and under the Honors College. We stand and represent the exact same principles," said  Brodzikowski.

The residence program at BBC will be called the Honors Place on the Bay, and Northup hopes to start with a small group this fall. 

"As this group grows, the program will increase its available space and activities," Northup said.

Students have a full range of privileges once they are enrolled in the Honors College, for example, special scholarships, priority registration, special residence halls, small classes and mentoring by professors.

"Students at BBC have no difficulty getting into their Honors classes, and they should have no difficulty with other classes, assuming the classes they need are offered. Honors students have priority registration, which allows them to register before all other students," Griffith said.

Ramos has committed the Department of Student Services and External Relations for the Honors College to increase enrollment.

"It takes an extra amount of effort on the part of the faculty to make enrollment grow at BBC. I don't know if every [office] is willing to do that, but we are," Ramos said.

Once the campus becomes well-known and both students and faculty become more active, BBC will have increased potential as a whole campus, which can mean more students enrolling in the Honors College there, according to Northup.

For enrollment to increase, some additional topics need to be addressed that are exclusive to students there.

"We need more attention here, more schools, more classes - especially evening classes - because BBC is much more of a 'commuting campus' than UP. BBC has a very large amount of students who work full-time, or almost full-time and still manage to take a full load of credits," Brodzikowski said.

Headline: WRGP signal expansion 'closer than ever'
Author: Alejandra Serna / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Books are dropped by the corner couch along with varying bags and jackets. As the door to the studio closes, a cap is tossed aside and replaced by a pair of oversized headphones. A chair is pulled towards the microphone as the signal is given and the show begins.

This is how the day starts at FIU's own student-run radio station, WRGP 88.1 FM. Despite its humble beginnings as 540 AM in 1989, WRGP has fought long and hard to increase its status on the air waves.

The struggle has currently reached its peak with the prospect of the station's  signal expansion.

This has been an ongoing project since the station's transfer from AM to FM in 1999. With university and government approval, as well as standing funding, WRGP looks forward to meeting this goal in the near future.

"At this point, we're closer than we've ever been," said Brennan Forsyth, WRGP's general manager.

The process involves placing an FM transmitter at the University Park campus and using a receiver to broadcast, or translate, the signal from the station's main tower in Homestead to another frequency in the North Miami area. This way, WRPG will be able to capture audiences at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

"The broadcast range will be much wider, and the station will be located on as many as three locations on the dial, so more people may find the station by merely 'surfing' the dial," said Larry Lunsford, associate vice-president of Student Affairs.

Although there are no current plans to adapt WRGP's programming to target BBC audiences, the station recognizes the importance of reaching this campus. 

"We hope it will spark interest through the mass communications program and get more students involved," said Jackie Diaz, WRGP's news director.

Robert Jaross, director of student media agreed.

"In my advertising and public relations research class, I had students conduct about 800 surveys and we found that BBC students are excited about having a station at BBC," Jaross said.

To optimize the potential interest of hundreds of BBC students majoring in communications, WRGP has set up an office on location and looks forward to future projects there. One of these is to one day establish a broadcasting studio at BBC.

"It would be so valuable for these students to have the experience of running a radio station," Forsyth said.

Another pending venture will be a Saturday morning talk show geared towards covering events on the national, local and university levels, as well as distributing attention between both campuses evenly. 

In addition to giving the station a broader audience through BBC, the signal expansion has also allowed WRGP to attain a frequency outside the Non-Commercial Educational (NCE) band. The station's new frequency, 95.3 FM, will fall within the commercial broadcast band, providing even more exposure for the station and its programming.

Although the station's programming features an eclectic mix of news, sports and university-related programming, its main focus is music. Also, despite having started out with top-40 rotation, it has moved away from commercial material and ventured into the independent and underground scenes.

"We strive to find material that is not readily available on commercial stations," said Jennifer Mojina, WRGP's programming director.

In addition to serving the university community, WRGP staff also believes in aiding underground artists.They hope the signal expansion will contribute to their artists as well as to the station.

"Unfortunately, there are still some final hurdles to clear," Forsyth said.

Details for the signal expansion have yet to be finalized. For this reason, WRGP has put a temporary halt on all promotional activity in order to focus on more pressing matters and organizational technicalities.

Nonetheless, the station has kept a positive outlook on the entire project, looking anxiously to its completion. 

 "As frustrating as this process might have been, it is just one more step forward in a long process of getting on the air," Forsyth said.

Headline: Students, faculty find Dr. Jones 'extraordinary'
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Among the ranks of FIU's Undergraduate Admissions and Student Affairs personnel, Rosa Jones is someone who has earned respect and admiration from her co-workers.

"Dr. Jones is one of the most well-versed people that I have ever met in regards to anything related to a student at the institution," said Ivonne P. Hernandez, administrative assistant to Jones.

 This October will mark the one-year anniversary of Jones holding the position of vice president of Student Affairs and Undergraduate Education.  

"It gives me the opportunity to work with students from the time that they come to the university to the time that they graduate," Jones said.  

Jones's responsibilities entail dealing with the range of undergraduate support areas, including lower-division academic advising. Jones also deals with testing, university learning centers, the Academy for the Art of Teaching, athletic academic supports and "the range of support services that really are designed to help deal with students from the time that they enter the university," as Jones described it.  Her duties allow for many opportunities to deal with students directly on a variety of issues.

"I have direct contact with a lot of students on a daily basis," Jones said.  "I have responsibility for dealing with freshman convocation, commencement and everything in between in terms of interacting with students."

Jones has worked at FIU since 1972, beginning as an associate professor in the School of Social Work - a position she still holds. After receiving her training in social work at the University of Miami, Jones came to FIU as a new faculty member to help implement an undergraduate program in social work.

"I didn't start off in higher education," Jones said. "My interest was initially focused on social work and the range of services that were related to human services. I truly enjoy that discipline,  but higher education has been something that I've been involved with for more than 30 years.  I'm intrigued with the classroom. I'm intrigued with students who evolve, come in, find themselves, find out what they want to do. There's a tremendous amount of satisfaction in working with students and seeing students reach their goal, and in some cases, helping them develop the potential that some of them may not be as confident that they can develop."

Students who have interacted with Jones and gotten to know her, hold her in very high regard. 

"Dr. Jones is very accessible to students," said graduate student Shelby Gilbert. "I think she has a sincere, caring concern for the students here at FIU and she goes out of her way to make sure that students are comfortable in the environment here, and that their needs are met."

"From my experience, she's here for the students," said first-year graduate student Chini Canargo. "She sits down with us to see what's going on and how she can help and serve us."

Jones's associates and co-workers speak very highly of her, as well.

"I've always had the greatest respect for her," said Valerie Johnsen, assistant director of the Academic Advising Center in Undergraduate Studies. "I had the sense that she was someone we could speak to if we had any problems.  As I have progressed in my position, and had more dealings with her directly, that's all been confirmed. She's not someone who will stand and say 'Oh, you know what, let me have someone else call this person.' She's very willing to go in and solve problems and talk to people."

"She's a pretty amazing individual," said Helen Ellison, associate vice president of Student Affairs. "She brings to Student Affairs a tremendous history of this university.  She's been here for 30-plus years, so she knows the university extremely well."

Ellison also praised Jones's concern for students.  

"A lot of times, when you become an administrator, and you're less involved with students on a more direct basis, sometimes you just kind of lose that edge, or you find that you're so busy you don't get to think of students.  But that is not the case with her.  She still sees students, which I think is wonderful because she has a huge staff who can take care of all of those incidentals, those specific problems that students have.  But she still takes students under her wing and I think that's pretty special."

As for Jones as a person, Ellison described her as "extraordinarily passionate, compassionate, hard-working and bright." 

"An extraordinary human being.  I have been in higher education for 35 years, and I have not worked with a vice president that was as well-rounded as she is.  Someone who is very bright and who has incredible leadership ability, who is also a very warm, kind human being.  She has high expectations of her staff, but she provides the most incredible balance of challenge and support that I've ever seen in anybody that I've ever worked for."

Not only does Jones enjoy her job but she enjoys working with her associates and co-workers.

"It's a pleasure for me to be with them, I feel very blessed to be able to work with people who are as committed as they are, when you are enjoying what your doing, it's not really work," said Jones.

Subheadline: Battle of the bands rocks Gracie's Grill
Author: Michelle Santisteban
&nbsp;
Gracie's Grill has been converted into a concert hall. Every Thursday, the Student Programming Council and Tau Kappa Epsilon sponsor Battle of the Bands. Students can sample some of Miami's hottest local bands for free. 

"The Battle of the Bands is a great way to support our local musicians and enjoy the talent of our peers. It's a great way to kick back and listen to Miami's finest," said Junior Dulce Duran.

The Sept. 15 Battle of the Bands experienced a good turnout from not only FIU students, but local kids, too. It was truly a diverse crowd - frat boys, sorority girls, punks and dorky kids alike all came out to listen to the local bands who played this event. 

The crowd wasn't the only diversity found, though. The musical differences between the bands were great. There were The Inmigrantes, a latin punk band; Jacuzzi Fuzz, a reggae rock band; The Vice, a pop-rock band; My Fatal Fall, an emo/screamo style band; and Mind You, a more "traditional" sounding rock band.

The Vice, who were formerly called Storyville (they had changed their name the day before the show), performed first. They were very energetic, and it was obvious that this wasn't their first gig - they were seasoned performers. Roni Landires, The Vice's lead singer, gave one of the best performances of the night - he had great stage presence and connected with the audience better than anyone else. As for the music in general - it was catchy, something that one would even find on the radio. The sound was tight and they did an overall good job. 

Mind You was the second band in the Battle of the Bands line-up. To begin with, they were visibly nervous. They went through some rough patches at the beginning of their set, but as they loosened up, their sound improved dramatically. They weren't as boisterous as The Vice, but they did seem to have a good time together on stage. Lead singer Yassel Orriols could have done more to connect with the crowd - most of the time he was stationary and seemed to always have his eyes closed. What Orriols lacked in energy, Wiggalo, their new bass player, made up for in sheer jolliness. There wasn't a single moment when he wasn't smiling and dancing around. Although Mind You was a bit boring at times, they did surprise the audience with a great guitar solo by Orriols, or an unexpected breakdown in the middle of a song.

Up next was Jacuzzi Fuzz. Their excellent musicianship was obvious from the get-go. They somehow blended their reggae sound with blues and latin influences, and made it work beautifully. The Fuzz's lead singer, Andy Clavijo, had a great voice - one that almost channeled Sublime's lead singer Brad Nowell at one point. Of all the bands, Jacuzzi Fuzz had the most relaxed vibe, probably due to the genre of music they played. But their lax attitude didn't hurt the band's sound in the least. The crowd seemed to enjoy their performance a lot - people were jamming along and they got quite a few cheers at the end of their set. 

The fourth band to take the stage was My Fatal Fall. They were very similar to The Vice in the sense that both bands' lead singers were great entertainers. Eddie, lead vocalist for My Fatal Fall, was into the music; he thrashed around, threw himself to the ground and gave his all. At times the bass was overpowering, drowning out the vocals a bit, but they got through their set without any major foul-ups. The audience wasn't as full during their set, since they were the second to last band to play, but that didn't stop them from rocking the crowd.

The show wasn't over, but people were already forming opinions on who their favorite Battle of the Bands group was. 

"I believe all the bands were exceptionally great, though my favorites were My Fatal Fall and the psychedelic rhythms of Jacuzzi Fuzz," said Richard Lopez, a sophmore majoring in business.

The last group to play, Los Inmigrantes, held the greatest contrast from the rest of the bands simply because the performance was in Spanish. Due to a mix-up - leading to some of the audience thinking that My Fatal Fall was the last band to play and leaving - only a few audience members and hardcore Los Inmigrantes fans were left in the crowd to watch. Los Inmigrantes gave a great performance, despite the low number of audience members, and dished out some amazing guitar solos. It didn't matter if you couldn't understand Spanish - the music was great regardless. They even got one guy up and dancing, which none of the other bands accomplished.

Jose Coloma, the TKE philanthropy chair, founded this new Thursday night event because of his love for music. 

"I'm not artistic or anything, but I'm a big music lover. I wanted to support local bands so I put all this together," said Coloma. 

"It's the first of it's kind," he said. But it won't be the last. The Battle of the Bands will be a regular Thursday night event. It will continue to be free to the public with the exception of Oct. 6, when they'll charge $2.99 for a bigger, and better fund-raising Battle of the Bands where around eight groups will play. All funds collected at the event will go towards the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Foundation.

Headline: Amateur playwright writes literary adventure, "Madagascar"
Author:  Ashley Capo / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
As the audience awaits patiently for the show to begin, one can only sit and marvel at the elaborate set. It is nothing but an old room with a queen-size bed covered in white linen. A single ceiling fan provides the light in the room, which allows shadow to fall on the already mangled walls. Dark rectangles are merely memories of where one can assume extravagant paintings once hung and on the right is a desk with a single chair. 

Suddenly, from the back of the audience walks an average looking, 35-year-old man. As he stands in front of this eerie set of a stage, he introduces himself. He is J.T. Rogers, the playwright of "Madagascar," the show that is about to be witnessed.

Although entitled "Madagascar," this play is far from a story about talking zoo animals and Disney fun. In fact, it was advised that this show not be meant for children at all, and after watching it, it was understood why.

"Madagascar,"  playing in The New Theatre in Coral Gables, tells the story of three coinciding individuals who battle inner demons while attempting to unravel the mystery of the disappearance of Gideon Paul, a brother and son to June and Lillian, respectively. 

With the added appearance of Nathan, a friend of the family with his own struggles, the characters all connect at one hotel room in the heart of Rome to try and understand the significance of Paul's departure from their lives, while also trying to uncover some deeply suppressed family secrets that can only be answered with the open hearts and minds of what is left of Paul's family.

Barely interacting with one another, the play is comprised mostly of monologues (one-character dialogues) that explain the characters' lives and connections with Paul and help the characters better comprehend Paul's rash decision to disappear. 

Lillian, played by Angie Radosh, and Nathan, played by Bill Schwartz - although they were, technically speaking, supporting roles - were completely marvelous to watch and easily understood. Their grasp on the language of the piece and seemingly effortless deliverance made the show. June's character, played by Kathryn Lee Johnston - who made her debut at the New Theatre with this role - was also very compelling, perhaps not as strong as the Radosh and Schwartz presence, but very defined nonetheless.

The intricacy of this story alone will leave your head spinning in confusion leading you to desperately watch these characters fall apart so that you may understand how fragile these characters are without the omniscient Gideon Paul. In fact, the events of the piece is in seriatim form, therefore they are nearly impossible to describe without taking away the spirit of the piece. Heavy-set in symbolism, it's impossible to feel as if all the symbols are caught the first time watched.

This play is a literary classic in the making. J.T Rogers's "Madagascar" will take English majors on a ride through a symbolism roller coaster, full of allusion corkscrews and allegorical loopy-loops. It is highly recommended for analytical minds everywhere who are looking for a nice workout for their frontal lobes.

The play received the American Theatre Critics Association's 2004 M. Elizabeth Osborne award, was finalist for the ATCA's Steinberg New Play Award, was seen Off Broadway as part of the SPF Summer Play Festival and won the 2005 Pinter Review Prize for Drama from the University of Tampa - which included as its prize publication of the play in hard-cover form. (Rogers should be very proud of this piece of beautiful writing.)

In this current time, with the destruction and death surrounding New Orleans and the thousands left homeless, keeping active in the arts is a way to keep up spirits and bring back the smiles that have slowly withered from our tired faces. 

Get out there and watch a couple of shows, visit art museums and watch movies. Most theatres in the Greater Miami area are sending relief and donations to the families of victims in New Orleans to help relieve the devastation. So contact your local theatre company and ask how you can help. Stay strong America, the show must go on.

Headline: Andy Milonakis takes child's play to another level
Author: Sarah Madkour / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
We all love to be childish sometimes. However, "The Andy Milonakis Show" puts childishness on the air for millions of people to watch. He makes Tom Green look like an amateur comedian.

Milonakis got his start by airing his private home videos on the Internet and slowly began to get recognized for it. 

One person who Milonakis got the attention from was comedian Jimmy Kimmel. Apparently, Kimmel thought Milonakis was funny enough to give him his own television show, and several appearances on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" prior to that. Kimmel's Jackhole Productions are now producing Milonakis's show for MTV. 

The show began to air this summer and has received a very good response from viewers. One problem the show has is it clearly shows how just about anyone can become a celebrity now-a-days.

The show's producer Brian Graden has compared Milonakis's comedy to that of Pee Wee Herman. 

"It's a skewed point of view from the prism of somebody who lives in his own bubble," Graden said in an interview with USA Today. The only difference is Pee Wee Herman meant no harm to anyone, and Milonakis takes pride in tormenting the people of New York, especially the elderly.

One big question surrounding the show is the true age of Milonakis. 

Is he 12 or 27? According to three different Internet websites including www.imdb.com and www.byroncrawford.com, his birthday is January 30, 1976, which would make him the ripe age of 29. 

It's hard to believe that someone with that face could be so much older, but it's true. Milonakis has a growth disorder that has not allowed him to fully mature physically. 

In an interview with Barbara Walters, though his appearance does make it "harder to get girls," he's in good health. 

"I don't have any liver or kidney disease like Gary Coleman," said Milonakis. This is what makes the show funny. Apparently, people want to see a man, who looks like a boy, patronize elderly people, which he regularly does on his show. 

The reality show era undoubtedly shows that anyone willing to make themselves look stupid enough can have their 15 minutes of fame too.  

The "Andy Milonakis Show" is different because he's weird. He's made that his trademark. Many people may not like the show because of that, but you can't please everyone. 

"I think he's unbelievably annoying. I don't understand why the show has become such a hit," said freshman Dennis Bencomo. 

Younger viewers tend to like it more, however the show can appeal to just about anyone. It's the kind of show that you either love or hate.
