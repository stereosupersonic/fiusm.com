Headline: Public nudity embraced at Haulover Beach
Author: James Sallee / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Loren Mejia had never been naked in public before because she never had the urge to do so.

"It's not something I've ever seriously considered. I mean, really, who wants to be naked in public? It makes no sense to me,"
she said.

Mejia, a junior at Middlebury College in Vermont who was raised in Shenandoah, Florida, was unaware that Florida's only
legal "clothing optional" beach resides right in her backyard, at Haulover Park.

As an experiment, Mejia ventured out June 19 to the nude beach located at 10800 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach during her summer vacation.

"I've never been away from Miami this long, and I promised myself that while I [was] home, I was going to try to experience as much of it as possible," Mejia said.

An estimated 1.3 million people visit the nude section of Haulover Beach every year, according to Oscar Rountin, a Haulover Park representative. He said they come for the scenic view, tennis facilities and the opportunity to be naked in public.

"We get comment cards all the time from people who thank us for giving them an opportunity to experiment with something they had wanted to try out for a while," Rountin said. "We also get comments saying
that we'll be following the nudists into hell because we give them a place to flaunt their nakedness freely."


Rountin said he was unfazed by the controversy the beach generates and thinks it's funny. 

The South Florida Free Beach Association, a group of "naturists," sectioned off a stretch of Haulover Beach and announced the area to be a nudist section in 1991. The 
association dared Miami Beach authorities to stop them, but they never did. The association pays an annual fee in order to maintain the beach's status at the only location in Florida to allow public nudity.

The beach has an array of colors and contrasts. White sand is backdropped by a wall of steel condos and hotels, painted different shades of whites and pastels.

The lifeguard stations which are painted in seafoam green, baby blue and light yellow, separate the beach into four sections that contain the swingers, families and gay community groups. Compacted between the towers are umbrellas, towels and naked bodies. An artist sitting on the sand painted, looking toward the backdrop for inspiration.

Mejia grew apprehensive about taking her top off as the day progressed.

"I was worried that people would be looking
at me. There were some people with  binoculars that weren't looking at the birds. I'm not really comfortable with my
naked body like some of those people are," Mejia said. 

"Gawkers" is a term used by the association to define people who go to the beach solely to see nude people. This is strictly forbidden at the beach and, if caught gawking, lifeguards and association volunteers will ask them to leave.


Meanwhile, a fellow beachgoer was on the lookout for someone to massage that day.

Larry Fleischman, a self-pronounced
"Beach Mayor," was wearing a straw hat with feathers and nothing else.

According to Fleischman, he is a former "beach ambassador," an association volunteer who welcomes newcomers to the beach and teaches them the etiquette that
goes along with being on a nude beach.

Fleischman said he was asked to leave because of his fondness for offering his massage services to nude sunbathers on a regular basis.

Mejia was not approached by Fleischman that day; she said she would have turned his offer down.

Fleischman, who said he has been to Haulover Beach "more often than I haven't been" in the last 15 years, remembers when it was frequented by small groups of European tourists and a few men who only hung out by the pink lifeguard tower.

Fleischman said the beach is now a booming community with  many regulars that he chats with daily.

"I hear about people who form a bond because they see each other all the time at the same Starbucks or the supermarket, and that's how it is with us. We have our own little free family," he said.

At no point did Fleischman ever mention someone as "nude," always "free," or "comfortable."

"Being free out here on this gorgeous beach with gorgeous women and friendly people is
the greatest feeling in the world," 
Fleischman said.

Mejia went home that day unable to call herself a "naturist," but she did come to a conclusion about public nudity.

"People really shouldn't be naked in public. It's kind of gross," Mejia said. "I'm glad they are that comfortable with themselves; I wish I was that comfortable in public, but I really don't want to see people naked anywhere." 

Fleischman would disagree with Mejia.

"People think that Haulover Beach is about exhibitionism, but it's not about people seeing you naked, or you seeing other people naked. I don't care if the beach
was completely empty, I'd still be naked. Being naked outdoors is a wonderful feeling," he said.



beachgoers soak up the sun at Florida's only nude beach located at 10800 Collins
Avenue in Haulover Park. The beach caters to a wide variety of groups including families, swingers and the gay and lesbian community.

Headline: Leak prompts changes in BBC pool
Author: Ever Cruz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A week before the FIU Swim and Sports Academy summer camp began at the Biscayne Bay Campus, Christina M. Fisher, aquatics coordinator, scrambled around in her office preparing the camp's schedule. She had to
deal with the unplanned fact that there would be no swimming in the campus pool this year for her 150 campers.

The camp began June 4, but the Department of Facilities Management did not notify Fisher until May 16 that the BBC pool would
be closed. 

Fisher believes the pool repairs are linked to the construction of the new fitness
center and cafeteria at BBC, since the fitness center will contain a walkway to the pool.

According to Elie "Elias" Bardawil, associate director of campus recreation, life and orientation, the pool, which
is part of the BBC Aquatic Center, is currently undergoing structural repairs due to a leak found by his department in April.

Bardawil said his department mentioned the leak to Facilities Management, who then decided to renovate the pool for the first time since it was built in 1983.

No one from Facilities Management was available for comment to discuss the pool's renovations.

Bardawil said the pool's renovations would be completed in two phases. Phase one would include updating the pool's plumbing, as well as working on its design to meet the specific needs of FIU's swimming and diving
team. Phase two will involve the relining of the pool's surface.

Bardawil did not specify when either phase would be completed.

"When the new renovations are done, the student body is going to have once again a first class facility on our beautiful [campus] and the University swimming and diving team will have a premiere facility for training and competition," Bardawil said. 

The closed pool lead Fisher and the camp counselors to search for an alternative
option for the four to 14-yearold campers this summer. The elementary school-aged children are taking instructional swimming at The British Swim School in Aventura.
Everyone else is participating in the BBC kayaking program instead.

Ashley Carlozzi, a summer camp counselor, dislikes the itinerary change.

"It's an inconvenience for all of us because we have to take buses to go to an alternate place," Carlozzi said.

Headline: Insufficient amount of sleep hinders students
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Fairytales are full of characters that fall asleep for hundreds of years under magical spells. 

It seems that after four years of long study nights and caffeine, college casts quite an opposite spell on students.

According to a 2001 study cited on the Brown University Health Education website, only 11 percent of college students receive a healthy dose of sleep, making them one of the most bleary-eyed age groups. 

While this demographic slept an average of seven to seven and a half hours per night in the 1980s, recent studies show they are now down to six or seven hours. 

As quantity and quality of sleep diminish, mental alertness is affected, as well as one's ability to perform well and recall facts, which are some of the main reasons why students compromise their sleep in the first place. 

If this pattern continues, a sleep debt gradually builds up and can rear its ugly head in the forms of irritability, disorientation, tension and even depression. 

Junior Kathie Warfel has been recently accepted to FIU's School of Nursing and has had to face a more strenuous workload than the one she previously carried. 

Yet, in the midst of pressure to succeed, a healthy amount of sleep is one thing that Warfel has found impossible to relinquish.

"I'm the type of person who can't stay up late, because I'm on a schedule in which I wake up early," Warfel said. "If I get less sleep one night and try to nap, it becomes a vicious cycle. [The minimum I get is] seven hours."

English Professor Ken Claus, who has taught classes scheduled as early as 6:40 a.m., feels that he cannot stress enough the importance of a good night's sleep to his students.

"The majority of students at any of my classes report an average of five to six hours of sleep per night," Claus said. "I know because I often ask." 

Many students have observed that their fellow classmates grow sick at least once a semester and have even fallen victim to frequent illness themselves. 

Claus says that part of the way this can be avoided is by refusing to cheat one's body of sufficient rest. 

"Students think they don't need much sleep and it always catches up with them," Claus said. "You can almost chart with precision that by the end of the first four to five weeks of class at least half the students are sick. Then another six weeks goes by and more plague. And then there are finals and it is like Europe 1380."

Claus has especially found this to be true of his own students because he often teaches early morning classes, many times taken by students who go straight to work after school. 

Not only does he give speeches to his students about the need for proper rest, but he has found creative ways to increase their level of awareness at such an early hour in the day.

"I do blast 'hair' heavy metal when everyone arrives," Claus said. "It is quite effective, but nowhere near as good as the Scots bagpipe."

Other more conventional ways exist to ensure one's alertness is at its maximum potential, such as maintaining the same bedtime each night and setting one's alarm for the same time each morning. 

Such a rhythmic schedule will help ward off insomnia. 

Joyce Hopkins, intern at the Department of Counseling and Psychological Services, said that relaxation techniques are helpful to students because sleep deprivation is often attributed to anxiety. 

"Having a problem with getting to sleep and staying asleep is stress -- obsessing about issues and concerns," Hopkins said. 

Hopkins also recommends eating a small snack right before going to bed such as an Oreo cookie and a glass of warm milk because milk contains an enzyme that naturally induces sleep. 	

Above all, however, Hopkins said the underlying issue must be dealt with. 

"Address the stress," Hopkins said. "Talk it over with a friend. Maybe try yoga and getting more control over thoughts." 

If students feel they need outside help with insomnia or sleep deprivation, they can contact the Health and Wellness Center at 305-348-2401.

Headline: My Life! Experience: Emotions soar high at launch
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Back when I was a little kid, I remember watching a shuttle launch on television and being in complete awe. It's no wonder many kids want to be astronauts - just being in that shuttle when it takes off has to be a hell of an experience. Of course, many of those kids end up changing their minds once they realize how much studying they actually have to do to get the opportunity.

Even after losing my desire to become a space explorer, I still wanted to attend a launch because, as impressive as it is on television, it had to be even more impressive in person.

So, after more than 10 years, when I had a legitimate opportunity to get some media passes for Mission STS-117 and be closer to the shuttle than any non-NASA employee (approximately 3.2 miles away), it was easy to say yes.

On the day of the launch, June 8, I drove up with absolutely no ceiling of expectation. Would it be disappointing? Would it be the coolest thing in the world? I was worried and excited all at once, not knowing which emotion dominated me more.

If you ever go to Kennedy Space Center you'll be completely amazed by the sheer size of the complex. It is 219 square miles, or almost one-fifth the size of Rhode Island. 

The most breath-taking aspect of the KSC, however, is the Vehicle Assembly Building. Driving into the site, the VAB can be seen from a distance - it's so gigantic that you think you're very close to the building, when you're actually over five miles away.

It's basically a completely hollow building where all of NASA's rocket-propelled vehicles are assembled vertically.

With this sight alone, I was already impressed. However, once I saw how far the shuttle was I immediately started to worry; I thought I would be closer. Couple that worry with the fact that I arrived just five minutes after the astronaut crew boarded - purportedly a great thing to see - and I didn't have the best outlook at this point.

With a little over three hours left until launch, I didn't know what I was going to do for the time being. I soon realized, however, the importance of the shuttle launch by just walking around the media area -- I saw reporters from Orlando, Jacksonville, Australia, Mexico and Japan. 

With 15 minutes left until launch time, people began moving to the grassy area right by the bay; the closest area to the launch pad. 

"T-minus 10, nine, eight, seven, six." Slowly, the people on the media site started joining in on the countdown. "Five, four, three, two, one."

Immediately, the rockets went off and the giant plume of smoke started forming around the shuttle. Then, a few seconds later, the sound of the rockets could be heard - I didn't think the speed of sound was that slow. Once that shuttle had taken off, I realized how wrong I was in thinking that I wasn't that close. 

The flame coming out of the rocket was so bright, that it was almost as bad as staring into the sun. I couldn't look directly at it for too long. The sound pulsed like a jackhammer, but much deeper and not as metallic sounding. 

What amazed me the most, however, was the reaction of the people in the media site. These people - who are paid to be objective and look at all sides of the story - clapped and cheered once the shuttle was out of sight. Hell, even I was struck with the sudden urge to clap.

It all happened so fast; it took a couple of minutes to realize that I witnessed one of the greatest - if not the greatest - human achievements ever. In fact, by the time that realization came, the orbiter was already in outer space. It was a humbling experience that satisfied my childhood curiosity of becoming a space explorer.

Headline: SCULPTURE SHOCK: Invaluable sculptures return to owner
Author: Maria Chercoles / News Director
&nbsp;
It seemed the perfect crime: over a dozen of sculptures worth millions of dollars disappeared overnight from University Park. While yellow tape marked the space where Michael Heizer's Elevated, Surface and Depressed sculpture of three volcanic rocks used to lay next to the Green Library, other works such as George Segal's Three People on Four Benches sculpture of three white figures in the Graham Center seemed to have vanished leaving behind no signs of ever even being there.

The 19 sculptures and installations removed last week from UP are part of the Margulies Z. Collection loaned to FIU more than a decade ago.  Some of these sculptures had become landmarks of FIU and the Frost Art Museum usually carried tours of the sculpture park for visitors and school groups.

Although by the time of publication the University had issued no official statement about the removal of the sculptures, Maydel Santana-Bravo, director of FIU's media relations, said in an interview that Margulies decided it was time to take the sculptures to a different location and give them more exposure after loaning them to FIU for more than 10 years.

"I don't know how long this has been in discussion, but sculptures of this value don't get carried out overnight," Santana-Bravo said.  

Marta De La Torre, interim director for the FIU's Frost Art Museum, said that the museum was notified a few weeks ago that approximately 18 sculptures would be removed. 

"Mr. Margulies did not give a reason for ending his loan and we do not speculate as to his motivations," De La Torres said in an email. 

According to Katherine Hinds, curator of the Margulies Z. Collection, Margulies had been considering recovering some of the sculptures sometime this summer.

"We had a great experience at FIU and after other universities showed interest in having some of the sculptures, we decided to relocate them after more than a decade [of having them there]," Hinds said.  

According to Hinds, the FIU's sculpture park was the third largest university collection after University of California and University of Pennsylvania. 

The sculptures will be relocated at different universities including University of Miami, University of Florida and Miami-Dade College. 

Among the sculptures being relocated is Eight Unit Cube, a white aluminum cube by conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, which stood between GC and Primera Casa. Another one is Charles Ginnever's Hangover welded metal sculpture behind GL, which will go to MDC's Kendall campus.

Other sculptures will go back to Margulies' warehouse in Wynwood in preparation for an exhibition which will open in September titled Sculpture: 1940 throu the Present.    

While some art students suggested Margulies was taking the sculptures because FIU did not provide proper maintenance to the sculptures, Hinds denied this.

"Sculptures are in good condition by all standards. All maintenance specifications for the loan were met at its highest level," she said. 

FIU's Faculty Senate Chair Bruce Hauptli, who plans to brief the senate about the relocation of the sculptures during the Steering Committee meeting this week, said that he has been hearing the rumors, including that Margulies had some concerns regarding the amount of publicity and recognition accorded to the sculpture park. However, he said there is not much substance supporting them.

"The items belonging to Mr. Margulies are on loan to the University….he is free to reassign these pieces to other location at any point," Hauptli said in an email. "The reassigned pieces will be missed, but we should be appreciative of his willingness to share elements of his collection with us. 

"The sculptures are invaluable. Without them, the university is just a bunch of buildings," said Associate Art Professor Pip Brant. 

According to Hinds, it's hard to know whether the sculptures will ever return to FIU, adding that the best thing about being involved in the art world is that you don't have answers about the future.

She did reassure, however, that the popular Tony Rosenthal Marty's Cube, which students traditionally rotate for good luck, will stay at FIU.

Headline: FIU sued after ethical dilemma
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
FIU has run into legal problems following a recent lawsuit filed by two former employees.

Mohammad Izadpanah and Reynaldo Morejon, former senior administrators of FIU's online course department, have sued for $10 million to cover the loss of future business and humiliation after being publicly accused of profiting from an e-textbook business the two started.

Filed on May 15, 2007, the lawsuit names FIU, Dean of the College of Business Administration Joyce Elam, and former Senior Vice President of External Relations Marcos Perez, as the defendants.

The defendants accused Izadpanah and Morejon of a conflict of interest after the University received a complaint on Feb. 28, 2007 by an employee of the online course department.

The lawsuit claims that the defendants knew that Izadpanah and Morejon were running a digital textbook company that did business with students. The two former business partners say they began their business, Elite Business Solution, LLC, in August of 2006 after the College of Business Administration, which runs the online department, stopped developing online textbooks due to budget constraints.

Izadpanah and Morejon claim to have developed three online textbooks sold at $60 each. The two said in their lawsuits and in emails to Elam that their company would have no influence over the adoption of their textbooks at FIU, and that transactions occurred completely independently from FIU as an institution.

Emails between Izadpanah and Elam included in the lawsuit indicate that Elam and other appropriate personal knew and approved of the business. One such email, sent from Izadpanah to Elam on September 25, 2006, outlines the terms of the company and states that Izadpanah had submitted an "approval of outside activities."

In this same email, Izadpanah wrote, "I feel confident that as long as we keep it low key that everything should be approved just fine. Hence, as long as someone doesn't go poking around, we should be just fine."

In the lawsuit, Izadpanah claims to be referring to professor Christos Koulamas, chairperson of the department of decision sciences and information systems of the CBA, who questioned "the affairs of FIU Online to the extent that such inquires exceeded the bounds of reasonable supervision and constituted harassment and 'meddling' or interference with the affairs of the department."

Maydel Santana-Bravo, director of media relations, said that Koulamas could not comment due to pending litigation.

Perez later claimed in a Miami Herald article that Izadpanah and Morejon were not truthful when filing requests for outside employment, which the two deny. Perez also said that FIU lawyers believed that the school owned the rights to the digital textbooks that Izadpanah and Morejon sold.

However, in a March 8 email to Elam, Izadpanah claims that the textbooks had "no affiliation" with FIU.

"I'm pretty sure someone on the team is just dissatisfied with their current salary and lashing out," the email says.

Izadpanah and Morejon have since resigned from FIU. Izadpanah was not available for comment.

Elam stated in an email to The Beacon that she could not grant interviews due to pending litigation.

Perez did not return a phone call or email request for comment. Perez resigned last month after accepting an offer to become a partner with the private equity firm MBF Healthcare Partners.

According to the Miami Herald Article, FIU was conducting an investigation into the matter that should have been completed by May 19. Santanta-Bravo did not comment on the investigation at the time of publication.

Headline: Impartial borders: Immigration laws inconsistent
Author: Jose Martinez / Asst. Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
The City of Miami can aptly be described as a haven for diversity. It is one of the few places in the nation notable for the large proportion of English, Spanish and Creole speakers. 

According to the 2000 United States Census, it is estimated that 74 percent of the individuals residing in the city of Miami speak a language other than English in their households, with a total of 1.1 million foreign born individuals living in the Miami -Dade metropolitan area, composing 51 percent of the total population. 

However, beneath the facade of diversity, and the promises of a new life in an affluent nation, immigrants have come to the realization that the immigration policies set in place are not necessarily equal.

This is a stark reality that has haunted leaders in the local Haitian  community for many years, due to the favoritism that is shown towards Cubans. 

The so-called 'wet feet, dry feet' policy, which underwent revision during the Clinton Administration in 1995, stipulates that once a Cuban immigrant makes it ashore, he or she can seek residency a year after arrival. 

These immigrants are not typically deported back to Cuba. However, those intercepted in the waters between the two nations are returned to Cuba immediately. 

The justification for the policy is ultimately the political discord that has engulfed Cuba since the advent of the Castro regime. 

However, while this policy has enabled innumerable immigrants from the imperiled Cuban nation to start anew in the United States, it has also provoked suspicions amongst not only the Haitian community, but a multitude of other foreign nationals who have seen their people targeted by the Department of Homeland Security.

For instance, Haitian and Mexican immigrants, a sizable chunk of the current influx to  South Florida, are forced to avert any contact that would expose them to immigration officials, even after crossing the borders that separate them from the United States.

The Castro regime has widely utilized political assassination and the threat of imprisonment as a means of quelling dissent. I personally can attest to the brutal means of control implemented by the regime. 

My grandfather, a virulent anti-Communist, was imprisoned 12 years for treason. His brother was put before a firing squad for actively plotting against the Cuban government.

Still, I adamantly oppose the 'wet feet, dry feet' policy because it overlooks the political discord that pervades many nations throughout Latin America. Haiti, for instance, recently saw the government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide overthrown by an armed resistance movement.

The chaos that ensued throughout the course of the coup was so severe, it warranted intervention by the U.S. Marine Corps. 

In  Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,  a survey of the criminal activity that transpired during this period gave tangible indications of human rights abuses. An estimated 8,000 murders and some 35,000 sexual assaults occurred in the 22 month transitional time span, mostly perpetrated by criminals, although abuses committed by political figures were also evident.



It is only fair to help Haitians escape an equally repressive government. To favor Cuban immigrants because of the nature of the Castro regime is truly an injustice. 

Conditions of political instability and utter chaos are emerging throughout Latin America. Many individuals have no choice but to flee with the sole hope of sparing themselves from the torture that their government may impose on them. 

The Department of Homeland Security needs to give dissidents and the politically oppressed-no matter what the nature of the regime is-the opportunity to legally obtain citizenship, and start a new life without the fear of governmental retaliation.

Headline: Editorial: Explanation deserved for removal of artwork
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Sometimes, you don't know what you have until it's gone. When FIU students show up for Summer B classes starting June 27, they may notice something strange about  the campus. By then, many of the sculptures that beautify our campus will be long gone.

What many students may not have realized is that the sculptures helped constitute the third largest university sculpture collection in the country. 

Art collector Martin Marguiles had been kind enough to loan them to FIU 10 years ago. Now he has decided to take some of them back. 

It is his right, and those who bemoan the disappearance of the sculptures should avoid criticizing him. The University was very lucky to have had them for 10 years, and Marguiles should be commended for allowing us to display them for over a decade.

And while removing these invaluable creations is a very sad and regrettable loss, some wonder why they were moved so suddenly and without warning.

These towering works of art were part of the University's identity, making FIU unique among Florida schools. At a time when the University is fighting to establish its reputation as a top tier institution of learning, it seems ironic that some of the most distinctive and impressive fixtures on our campus should disappear with such little fanfare.

What makes their removal all the more troubling is the fact that the University has been oddly quiet throughout the whole process.

Sculptures do not disappear overnight. Their removal had to be in the works for some time. Yet the University neglected to mention their imminent disappearance to the student body. In fact, as of June 22, they have yet to issue an official comment.

No comment on the removal of several priceless works of art.

No comment on the disappearance of a valuable part of our school's cultural identity.

In an environment devoid of explanations, there is no shortage of compelling theories as to what incited this turn of events.

Was there a lack of proper maintenance on the part of the school? Did Mr. Marguiles feel there was insufficient promotion and appreciation of the collection? Perhaps there was a dispute between Marguiles and school administrators which led to their removal.

In any situation where something valuable is taken away from FIU, it is only natural for some to assume, perhaps unjustly, that the administration must have done something wrong.

When no one provides answers, it is only human to ask questions.

Regardless of whether FIU or anyone is at fault, the University response (or lack thereof) only invites negative assumptions and speculation about the whole episode.

Headline: END OF ERAS: Three tenured coaches no longer working for FIU
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Athletic Director Pete Garcia used the 2007 spring season to make head coaching changes he hopes will push FIU athletics towards prestige. 

Three head coaches and 65 years of head coaching experience were removed in a span of two weeks during the month of May.

Garcia, the maestro of FIU's athletic program, fired women's softball coach Kim Gwydir and men's baseball coach Danny Price. Men's soccer coach Karl Kremser announced his retirement on May 7. 

"Making any change is a very difficult process, but the ultimate responsibility I have to the university, to our alumni, our students and to the South Florida community is that we have the right head coaches in place to lead us in direction we want to be heading," Garcia said.

Gwydir was FIU's first women's softball coach and the first to be fired by Garcia this spring. She compiled a career 326-294 record during her 10 year tenure, but the team found little success recording a 22-34 record during the 2007 season. 

"I have lots of memories, and I did start the program from scratch," Gwydir said. "There are still a lot of players I'm attached to. Everything happens for a reason; there's always a big plan in life and this is just part of it."

Price recorded FIU's first base hit as a player and proceeded to coach the men's baseball team for 28 years in which he compiled a record of 1,086-597.

Unlike Gwydir, Price's departure was not a smooth process. The Miami Herald reported that Garcia gave Price the option to quit or be fired.

"Garcia asked me 'how do you want to handle this?'" said Price. "He just kept alluding to resigning and I just said, 'Pete, I don't quit. I won't quit. It's not part of my stuff,'" Price said.

Price said that public safety officers escorted him off campus on May 19, a Saturday night.

The FIU athletic department released a statement saying it did not order public safety officers to remove Price from the University Park baseball stadium.

The university police refuted the accusations saying they were unaware of Price's dismissal.

Price's 2007 season record of 26-29 was his third losing season of his FIU career. He established the baseball program at FIU in 1980 and was the longest tenured head coach in the history of FIU athletics.

"Let me tell you wholeheartedly that when I look at you today, yes my heart's broken, part of it torn out. My uniform was torn off. Yes, I'm hurting . . . This is one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I didn't quit on anybody,'' Price said.

The only head coach not directly removed by Garcia was Kremser. 

Kremser, as reported by Gary Davidson on SoccerTimes.com, announced his unofficial retirement in 2002 by entering the Florida Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP), which provides state employees with a pension plan for five years leading up to retirement.  

At that time, men's soccer was on the brink of extinction.  

In the years following the "rebirth" of men's soccer in 2003, Kremser and former athletic director Rick Mello discussed his possible return after his retirement date, which is permissible. 

Garcia, on the other hand, felt that Kremser's return was not in FIU's best interest.

"[Kremser] should have thought about [not retiring] five years ago when he put in for the state DROP program," Garcia said according ot the Soccertimes.com.  	

"You're either retired or you're not.  We're a state school. You can't have your cake and eat it, too. How do you explain it to the taxpayers?"

"It was not the way I wished things to end," Kremser said. "I think we could have done something special."

Two of the vacant head coaching jobs have been filled by new baseball coach Henry "Turtle" Thomas and men's soccer coach Munga Eketebi.

Thomas' track record includes more than 30 years of experience, 14 trips to the College World Series and 18 straight top 10 baseball recruiting classes to the Golden Panthers program.

Eketebi is no stranger to FIU men's soccer as he played four years and has been the team's assistant coach for the past 20 years with the exception of 2004 when he was head coach of the Nova Southeastern University men's soccer team. 

He led the NAIA Knights to a 12-6-1 record. 

A women's softball coach has yet to be hired as of June 22.

The head coaches who cut ties with FIU under Garcia all had losing seasons their last year. 

Women's basketball head coach Cindy Russo and men's basketball head coach Sergio Rouco both had under .500 records in 2007. Despite the men's basketball team's lack of success, coach Rouco says he does not believe his job is in jeopardy, and he supports Garcia's recent personnel decisions.

"Pete Garcia was hired as athletic director to be successful," Rouco said. "I encourage his hiring and him pushing us to the limit to succeed. I am ecstatic that he is here."

Garcia trusts his coaches to lead FIU to success in the future, especially in terms of recruitment.

"Obviously the coaches that we're hiring have to be excellent recruiters," Garcia said. 

"I believe everything in life is about recruiting, whether you're recruiting a coach, faculty, a dean or a spouse. 

"I look at the coaches and make sure I have the coaches to go into the future."

Headline: Commentary: Coaching changes necessary to awaken 'sleeping giant'
Author: Adam Wasch / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
his is Pete Garcia's world, and we're all just living in it. 

Since the FIU Athletic Director was hired last October, the school has parted ways with five head coaches. 

In the month of May alone, Garcia fired baseball coach Danny Price, women's soccer coach Everton Edwards and women's softball coach Kim Gwydir.  Karl Kremser was ushered into retirement after 27 years as head coach of men's soccer. Don Strock resigned last November after five seasons as FIU football's head coach.  

Ninety years of combined FIU head coaching experience gone in a flash. 

The accolades and success of these coaches are aplenty.  Price, the architect of the baseball program, finished a 28 year coaching career with a 1,086-597 record and only three losing seasons.   Kremser earned six Coach of the Year awards and sent 40 players to the pros.  Edwards, Gwydir and Strock built the foundation of their respective programs.  

That was then, this is now.  Welcome to the new era in FIU athletics.  

While it was certainly poignant to lose such dedicated individuals that devoted their heart and soul to FIU, college athletics in the 21st century are not for the weak of heart. Garcia understands this fact, and he wants FIU students to understand it.

Division I athletic departments are run like corporations, and President Maidique hired Garcia to be the CEO.   

The term is "cutting the fat," and Garcia is using a ginsu knife expertly streamlining the FIU Athletic Department with precision.  Garcia is on a mission to break the mold of mediocrity that has been FIU Athletics in the aggregate, over the past three decades.  

The rest of the university is doing its part to rid the mantra that FIU is just a "commuter school."  

The FIU College of Law is excelling on all levels, the medical school will accept its first class in Fall 2009 and the business programs are ranked nationally.  

Now it's time for FIU athletics to follow suit. 

If one of FIU's esteemed academic programs posted average or below average numbers for almost thirty years, wouldn't you want to bring in a respected individual from a prestigious university to shape the program and bring in new professors?  

Well, as difficult as it is to say, one of the most "prestigious" universities in Division I athletics is Garcia's alma mater and former employer, the University of Miami.  

When the dust settles from the firings, the residue left is a group of elite coaches with winning attitudes.

The football team starts fresh with head coach Mario Cristobal.  Cristobal is an energetic and youthful local product with a University of Miami football pedigree and lofty ambitions for a program that can only get better.  

The men's soccer team promoted Munga Eketebi, Kremser's assistant coach for the last two decades. 

Eketebi, Florida's Player of the Year in 1985, has the opportunity to finish what Kremser started.  

Garcia hired Thomas Chestnutt to coach  the women's soccer team, who is a former University of Florida alumnus with a plethora of experience in coaching and playing. 

As for baseball, Garcia went after one of the country's most relentless recruiters in Henry "Turtle" Thomas. Thomas signed 18 consecutive top-ten classes with LSU and the Hurricanes prior to his stint as assistant coach of the College World Series bound Arizona State Sun Devils. Thomas brings a new energy to the baseball program that had been lacking toward the end of the Price era.  

"FIU is a sleeping giant," Thomas said in his welcome speech in front of University Park Baseball Stadium.

With a coveted South Florida location, new football stadium and an athletic director committed to excellence, FIU now has a reason to believe that the "sleeping giant" might just awaken in the very near future.

Headline: Men's basketball makes big addition
Author: Darren Collette / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Tall players are synonymous with the sport of basketball. This Fall, a seven footer by the name of  Russell Hicks will join the Golden Panthers basketball team.

His mother and father stand at  6 feet and 6 feet 5 inches tall respectively. 

He started playing basketball when he was in the seventh grade and soon grew and towered over his classmates. 

Hicks attended Westlane High in Ontario Canada,where he achieved his full height and started to draw a lot of attention on the basketball court with his impressive size and great stats. 

He was named his team's MVP and the top player in the Niagara Falls region. 

Following high school, Hicks enrolled at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif. 

As a freshman, he played in 30 games and averaged 4.0 points per game, 3.1 rebounds, 1.6 blocks and 14.6 minutes. 

At the end of the season, he was selected to the West Coast Conference (WCC) All-Freshman Team.

Heading into his sophomore year in Pepperdine on the day before an exhibition game against the University of Connecticut, he sustained an injury to his left foot. 

The injury forced him to sit out for eight weeks. He did return after Christmas break and finish the season; however, Pepperdine was in a slump and lost most of their remaining games.   

After that disappointing season, Pepperdine head coach Paul Westphal was fired in a coaching shake-up. 

This was a major factor in Hick's decision to transfer.

"I really liked Paul Westphal and the other coaches," said Hicks. 

"The coach that came in [Vance Walberg] was a great guy. Unfortunately, he was a more guard-orientated coach and it was not going to work with my big man style of play and it took away parts of my game. I just did not feel comfortable at Pepperdine anymore."

Hicks says he decided to attend FIU because of the area, coaching staff and weight training program

Since arriving at FIU Hicks has made an immediate impression on his teammates and most notably on men's basketball head coach Sergio Rouco.

 Coach Rouco is very excited to have a player like Hicks calling him "a proven guy."

"He has an inside presence that can change the game defensively," said Rouco. 

We are a good defensive team, but we always give up that second shot. Now we got a guy that can alter and change shots defensively, so percentages go down and you get an opportunity to win ballgames." 

His teammates are also very excited to be playing with him.

Transfer guard Kenneth White states, "Russell Hicks is very tall and he can dominate the basket." 

The players await the arrival of another 7-footer, Badara N'Diaye, who joins the team over the summer. 

This will give FIU a very tall inside lineup most NBA teams do not possess.

 Hicks has been at FIU over the summer practicing with his new teammates and working out with the conditioning staff. 

He is also coaching at Sergio Rouco's Worldwide Basketball Camps, Inc., where his teams have done well.

Headline: Payroll system upgrades to online, saves time
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
For University employees, the days of time cards recording every hour worked, supervisors verifying then signing the cards and making sure the cards made it to the payroll office in Pimera Casa are a thing of the past.

An online system called Time Saver replaced the traditional time cards June 15, offering employees a more efficient way to log in hours worked. It is run by Automatic Data Processing, Inc, a firm that processes over 32 million paychecks a week, according to its website. 

The first paycheck scheduled under Time Saver will be issued July 6.  

Carlos Flores was the director of the Payroll Transition Project, which was responsible for the switch.

"It's a cultural change," Flores said. 

According to Flores FIU has over 4,000 employees who are paid by the hour and that the switch will also cut down on costs of managing payroll.  

Some students, such as Martha Maria Lopez, a sophomore who works at the Graham Center Information Desk, quickly pointed out some of the advantages:

"Its easier," she said. "You can access it from anywhere."

But besides allowing employees to log in from any personal computer, the system also allows a more accurate record of work hours. Employees can log hours worked, vacation hours, and sick days, as well as edit other personal information. 

Once their online time cards are filled out, they are submitted through the web to various department heads that are responsible for verifying the hours logged.  

The new system can be accessed from any PC with Windows, Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher, and Adobe Reader 6.0 or higher. A drawback about Time Saver is that it will not work on Macintosh computers or on the Safari web browser according, to the PTP website.

Despite the system's advantages, a system failure that could result in them not being able to log in their hours is a general concern among student employees. Lopez also has concerns about possible system failures that could result in the loss of logged hours entirely with no physical records of them.

"Paper is proof," Lopez said. 

However, Flores commented that ADP uses a wide variety of redundant data back up systems that would make the total loss of data highly unlikely if not impossible.  

Pablo Vega, a Graham Center Lab attendant, was also concerned that older, technologically unversed FIU employees might find it harder to adapt to the new system.

"For me its easier," Vega said. "But for older [employees] it may be harder." 

Another key aspect of Time Saver is that employees must be careful about when they submit their hours through Time Saver. With the previous time cards, there was some leeway. Even if past due, employees could still receive payment. With Time Saver, if an employee does not submit hours on schedule, he or she will not be paid for that two-week pay period. 

According to Sherry Carrillo, associate director of University Park's Green Library, it is unknown how Time Saver will affect the approximately 250 full-time and part-time employees who work there. 

"We think it's a positive thing like any other new system. We will deal with issues as they come up," Carrillo said.

There will be several Time Saver workshops this week. For a complete list see the PTP website at ptp.fiu.edu. For technical support, employees may email payroll@fiu.edu or call 305-348-2181.

Headline: WHAT YOU MISSED: The Beacon Recaps the Events of Summer A
Author: Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
BBC celebrates 30th anniversary :
Students gathered outside the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management's building patio June 12 to celebrate the Biscayne Bay Campus' 30th anniversary. The event also generated many opinions regarding BBC's expansion, resources, and general future.

At the event, Lillian Lodge Kopenhaver, dean and professor of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, stood on the stage overlooking the patio and gave a first-hand account of the building's inauguration day 30 years ago. 

Other appearances at the celebration were Noel Browne and Nadia Turner, both former FIU students.

Browne is now an R & B singer and Turner was a  finalist on the television show American Idol.

Browne and Turner performed on stage and sang BBC the birthday song.

The event ended with the cutting of the BBC birthday cake by Damian Fernandez, the University's vice provost, Cathy Akens, assistant vice president of student affairs, and Katiana "Kathy" Saintable, SGC-BBC president.



Crist rejects five percent tuition increase:
Governor Charlie Crist has rejected a proposed five percent tuition increase for state universities and community colleges.  

Crist signed a $71.5 billion budget for the state May 24.   
"I feel for our students and I feel for their families," Crist said. "They are paying higher insurance rates. They are paying higher property taxes. They are paying higher gas prices. I don't think it's right to make them pay higher tuition, too."



Football stadium renovations begin:
FIU officials held a groundbreaking ceremony at the FIU Football Stadium May 25 for the renovations that will take place through the next months at the stadium. Representatives from FIU and Odebrecht Construction Inc., the company in charge of the project, were present at the ceremony.

Phase one of the three-phase-project will cost $31 million and will add 10,500 seats and other amenities to the stadium. These include 14 air-conditioned luxury suites, a wrap-around concourse with a full field view, 1,400 club seats, a video scoreboard and a stadium club.

FIU officials said phase one of the stadium renovations will be completed by the Golden Panthers' 2008 season home opener against South Florida. While construction takes place this year, all home games will be played at the Orange Bowl.

"As fast as we can do things the right way, we're going to do them," said Athletic Director Pete Garcia. "We're going to go at a faster speed than people think at everything we're going to do."



NFL drafts two Golden Panthers:
Former Golden Panther linebacker/defensive end Antwan Barnes was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fourth round with the 134th pick overall, while former wide receiver Chandler Williams was selected in the seventh round of the draft with the 233rd pick by the Minnesota Vikings. 

Although Williams and Barnes are the first two Golden Panthers to be selected during the NFL draft, they are not the only Golden Panthers who may make NFL roster next year.

Former defensive back Chris Smith signed a free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles the day after the draft had ended. Also, former linebacker Keyonvis Bouie signed a free agent contract with the New Orleans Saints.

Barnes is the all-time FIU career leader in tackles for losses with 57 and sacks with 22. His performance at the NFL increased his draft stock by recording one of the fastest 40-yard dash times among linebackers.

Williams left FIU as the all-time leader in receptions with 203. He also set the single season school record with 67 catches.



Vice President Marcos Perez resigns:
After four years of work at FIU, Executive Vice President of External Relations Marcos Perez resigned. University President Modesto A. Maidique announced the resignation in a university-wide email dated May 30.

Perez has accepted an offer to become a partner with the private equity firm MBF Healthcare Partners.

Perez was an FIU alumni, completing his BS in 1990 and an MBA in 2000. He also competed on the Men's tennis team.

During his time at FIU, Perez served Chief of Staff for Maidique, Vice President for Administration and lead the Division of External Relations as the Executive Director of the Foundation Board of Directors.

Perez also lead the Governmental Relations unit in the Southern Wine and Spirits South Beach Wine and Food Festival. The event raised a net of more than $1.5 million for FIU.



Athletics loses 12 NCAA scholarships:
FIU lost twelve scholarships due to inadequate graduation rates, the most lost by any Division 1 school.

This is based on results from the National Collegiate Athletic Association, known as NCAA, which released its Academic Progress Rates for the 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 academic years.

APR is calculated by giving points to each team based on the number of players in good academic standing and on the number of players who remain in the institution.

The minimum score a team can record without losing any scholarships is 925, which indicates that the team's athletes earned 92.5 percent of all possible points and that the team is on track to graduate 50 percent of its athletes.

If a team scores less than 900, it cannot replace scholarships even if an academically ineligible player leaves the team.

This year, three FIU teams scored less than 900: baseball, football and basketball.

As a result, FIU will lose 9 scholarships in football, two in men's basketball and one in baseball.

Baseball scored the worst, with 850, and was placed in the top 1st-10th percentile nationally, which means that 90 percent of Division 1 schools were better at graduating players. The basketball team scored 870 and the football team scored 889.

To date, the NCAA has taken back nine scholarships from FIU; the remaining three scholarships will be lost in the Fall Semester.



Lakeview Hall closes for maintenance:
Lakeview Residence Hall  closed at the end of Summer A because of  maintenance needs. 

According to James Wassenaar, executive director of student affairs, Lakeview was closed  to replace its faulty shower pans.

"We closed Lakeview to ensure there would be no mildew problems," Wassenaar said. "If there were mildew problems we would not let students live there." 

There had been rumors circulating that Lakeview was being closed due to a mildew infestation. However, this was not confirmed by the Housing Office. 

Following housing policy, students in Lakeview were notified by email May 15 that they would be relocated.

All freshmen students were transferred to Panther Hall while all upperclassmen students were relocated to the University Park Apartments.
