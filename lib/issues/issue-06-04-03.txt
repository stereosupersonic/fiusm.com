Headline: Medical school approval celebrated
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
FIU celebrated the approval of the new School of Medicine with a grand and rousing ceremony at the Graham Center pit on March 30. 

The event was attended by many members of the University Board of Trustees, the administration, faculty and staff, as well as a large group of students.

Student Government Association President Alex Prado opened the festivities of the afternoon by giving a background on President Modesto A. Maidique before introducing the president, who walked to the stand amid applause. 

Maidique raised his voice proudly and boldly as he announced how 35 years ago, FIU was started off by the first president, who stated that the University would never get a Division I-A football team.

"Since the beginning, we were a stealth operation," Maidique said. "People said we would never get a School of Architecture. We got it. People said we would never get a Division I-A football team. We got it. People said we would never get a law school. We got it. And most significantly, people said we certainly will never get a medical school and you know what, 15-1, we got it!"

Junior Richard Lopez was really happy for FIU. 

"It's a phenomenal addition to the University," Lopez said, when referring to the new School of Medicine. "It moves the University above and beyond what they can currently do. It will get FIU a stronger reputation as a school because now we have a medical school."

As he introduced former provost and current chancellor of the State Board of Governors Mark Rosenberg, Madique reminded the audience that Rosenberg had been the lead player in the accomplishment of a 10-year goal. 

"I don't want people to forget that the leader in all these years has been Mark Rosenberg, our very own chancellor of FIU at Tallahassee and my adopted son," Maidique joked.

"I think it's great to see Dr. Rosenberg back over here in Miami," said Brian Swenson, president of the FIU homecoming council. "I think that Rosenberg, along with many other people, have worked hard for this. 

"It is especially nice to see that the president has got the student government involved. It's great to see him down here at the student level."

Rosenberg thanked the students and the University in general for their support for the new school and the warmth and the confidence the South Florida community has bestowed upon the University.

Interim Provost Ronald Berkman added that the 30th marked the official start of the initiative to get the School of Medicine underway. 

Berkman also took time to recognize the efforts of the 25 students who accompanied the president and the board to Tallahassee.

Providence Okoye, Student Organizations Council Vice President, was among the 25 students who accompanied President Maidique to Tallahassee to support the Medical School proposal. 

Okoye stated that the new school means a lot to her because she can now look back and be even more proud of FIU.

"For me, going to FIU has been a dream come true. This means everything to me," Okoye said. "It's exciting to see that the final piece of the University that would make it great is here. You can't imagine how happy I feel." 

However, there are students who feel that the hype and media coverage of the School of Medicine has been excessive.

"It's nice to see that FIU has a School of Medicine but I do think there has been a little too much hype around it," said senior Osvaldo Ponton.

Junior Gavin Noronha agreed that there has been a lot of noise and coverage of the school.

"Firstly, it was frustrating to be barraged with e-mails everyday counting down to the vote for the School of Medicine," Noronha said. "Yes, I know we're getting a School of Medicine, but it gets on people's nerves. We just got approved for a school. This doesn't mean that we will be an accredited school."

The festivities of the afternoon ended with a barrage of decorations, balloons and the sound of Kool and the Gang's "Celebration" where Berkman awarded Maidique the first faculty cloak of the School of Medicine for his "surgeon-ship" and leadership.

Headline: SGA presidential candidates discuss strategies ~ Alfonso Leon
Subheadline: UP Candidate
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
Alfonso "Alfie" Leon served in the Student Government Association as Representative- at-Large this past year and is the only candidate at University Park to run for SGA president alongside  Providence Okoye as his running mate for vice president. The Beacon recently sat down with Leon to discuss running unopposed, giving advice to students running for the Representative-at-Large position and why students should vote in the upcoming elections taking place April 5 and 6. 

Q: How does it feel to run unopposed?	

It's a humbling experience, instead of the elections beings the highlight of my year, it will be the moment I realize that we have accomplished all the goals as a council this year.

Q: What is your goal during campaign week?

Getting students informed about voting. We want students to be informed. Through the campaign, we want students to voice their concerns. In the past, when people run for SGA, you need to maximize where you are and how many people you speak to. Our goal is to go around campus and speak to students, even if it means an hour-long conversation. If a student has a question we are going to answer it. When you see us, come ask … every idea will be taken into consideration.

Q: How did your experience in SGA prepare you for being president?

The leadership experience that I gained through SGA and the people I met prepared me. I've been able to get involved in every aspect of campus and student life. They have helped me understand that there is no FIU student mold, we are all so different and through them I have learned [the value of] community service and leadership. I thank my friends for preparing me - these people have given me ideas that have prepared me to be a student leader.

Q: The attention has shifted to the Representative-at-Large position. What advice would you give to the candidates?

I would tell them to create the buzz for elections. It's up to them to set the tone for these elections [and] treat it as their own. 

Q: What advice do you give the student body during elections?

These are your representatives. They help allocate over $8.5 million of student money. Treat them the same as you would to some one who was running for president [of the United States].

Q: When did you decide you wanted to be SGA president and why?

It was the first day of freshman orientation, during the SGA segment I met Clayton Solomon  [SGA president at the time] and he told me that only 50 percent of what you learn in college is learned in the classroom and that sparked my involvement in SGA.

Subheadline: BBC Candidat
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
Having had several positions with the Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Association throughout his college career, Zach Trautenberg, who currently sits as the organization's comptroller, has decided to run for president in the upcoming elections taking place April 5 and 6. The Beacon recently interviewed Trautenberg about his experience for the position, the current administration and his plans for BBC.

Q: What SGA and student leadership experience qualifies you to serve the student body as a member of the Student Government Council?

I have been Academics Affairs chair, Student Union Board chair [and] am currently the finance chair. I was chair of the Medical School Ad-hoc Committee at BBC. I have sat on the Diversity Awareness committee and the student Health Advisory Committee. I am also president and founder of BBC Wish Givers.

Q: How do you feel the current administration is spending SGA funds?

A: They're spending too much money internally, like on office supplies, flyers, name tags and shirts. We're spending too much money promoting SGA. I'd rather spend money on the students and buy them 1,000 Blue Books.

Q: What makes you the best candidate for the job?

A: I have three years of experience and have seen what works and does not work. Currently, as finance chair SGA has spent too much money internally and has not focused on the students' needs. BBC has nine goals this year and a month away from the end we are starting one. 

Q: If elected, how would you use $9,000 executive discretionary funds account?

A: I would use discretionary funds on things like shirts and name tags and use general funds on students.

Q: What would your top five goals be if elected?

A: In no particular order: Food services at the Pines Center, better transportation, Meal Plans (all you can eat), more communication from students and the beautification of Bay Vista.

Headline: Campus Invasion brings mainstream rock to University
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On April 11, the mtvU Campus Invasion tour will fill Pharmed Arena with sounds from rising rock bands Motion City Soundtrack, Straylight Run and Hellogoodbye. 

The tour will be brought to the University by the Student Programming Council, and FIU will be the only campus on the tour broadcasted on MTV networks. 

The mtvU Campus Invasion tour is an annual tour stopping at college campuses nationwide to showcase new rock music. The tour was first brought to the University in Spring 2004 with headliner Hoobastank and opening bands Lost prophets and Ima Robot.

This year, headliner Motion City Soundtrack is touring in support of their latest album Commit This to Memory. Their hit single "Everything is Alright" is receiving regular airplay on mtvU, and the band recently finished touring with pop-punk band Fall Out Boy late last year.

Supporting act Straylight Run is also touring to support their latest disc. Titled Prepare to Be Wrong, the disc is an extended play (EP) album featuring six new songs. The group's self-titled 2004 debut included the hit "Existentialism on Prom Night." Hellogoodbye, the other opening act, expects to release a new disc sometime later this year. 

"I'm really excited about seeing all the bands perform," said SPC member Rosalyn Delgado. "I really think that this concert will be a great opportunity for bands like Motion City Soundtrack and hellogoodbye to gain exposure."

Tickets for FIU students are available at the Campus Life office in GC 2240. Students will receive one ticket per student ID. 

Additional tickets can be purchased at the Pharmed Arena box office for $5. 

Since March 13, the official start date for concert promotion, over 500 FIU students have acquired free tickets for the show. Slightly over 100 public tickets have been purchased at the Pharmed Arena.

"We expect a big portion of our sales the day of the show. A lot of students wait until the last minute to get their tickets, so we expect a big turnout when April 11 comes around," said SPC Concerts Committee Chairperson Jackie Gadea.

To promote the event, SPC members have been posting posters and handing out flyers around UP. Aside from promotion within the University, outside promotion has been prevalent as well. 

"We gave 480 complimentary tickets to radio stations and news outlets for giveaways," Gadea said. "Stations like 93 Rock and newspapers like The New Times have all received tickets to give away. We are also giving tickets away at SPC's advance movie screenings." 

Leading up to the event, a concert mini-series called First Strike is taking place every Monday and Wednesday in the GC Atrium and Gracie's Grill. Free food is being given out to any students stopping by the events to learn more about the upcoming concert. 

In addition to receiving free food, students can also sign up to win backstage passes to the Campus Invasion concert.

On the day of the event, the mtvU Village will be set up in the Betty Chapman Plaza from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.

 At the Village, attendees will have the opportunity to meet some of the bands and receive free stuff from the show's sponsors. 

"The Village will have tents set up for the tour's seven main sponsors including Butterfinger and Neutrogena. LIFE beat, a nonprofit organization, will also be out to help promote AIDS awareness," Gadea said.

Doors open at 6 p.m. on the day of the show. The concert is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. More information can be found at www.yourspc.com.

Headline: DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION!
Subheadline: Introduction to dance class offers academic flexibility
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Katherine Kramer tap dances in the middle of the studio as Nat King Cole's "L-O-V-E" plays on the stereo. Fifteen students stand around her, following her every move as she leads them over the taps in the chorus. 

Throughout the semester, students in Kramer's class have received training in various dance forms such as salsa, swing and currently, tap dance. 

Introduction to dance (DAN 2100), taught at the University since the early days of the dance program, gives students an overview of dance from a variety of cultural and traditional perspectives. Created for non-dance majors, the class is offered for students as part of a liberal arts education major or for extra credit.

Kramer has choreographed many of the University's dance and theatrical productions including Hair. She believes that through this class, non-majors get exposure to dance forms they would not normally know about.

"It's part of a liberal arts education and it encourages students to embrace creativity, open-mindedness and creative thinking," Kramer said.

Kramer stated that the course is highly engaging and it not only gives students the opportunity to experience a variety of dance forms and to learn about the origins of dance, but also to understand technique and to train the body.

"[Students] have the opportunity to experience a handful of different dance forms physically; some of them more artistic, some of them more social and recreational and some of them more ancient or cultural," Kramer said. "They get a sense of where dance comes from and they learn the craft of choreography." 

Senior Ricky Rojas, a finance major, enrolled in the class because he didn't want to enroll in another stressful academic class. He also wanted to learn salsa.

 "I took this class as an elective. I thought to myself - 'Why not take dance instead of a math or a science class?'" Rojas said. "I wanted to learn salsa and I learned that at the beginning of the semester."

Senior Yalena Martinez, an English major, needed an elective class on her class schedule before she graduated at the end of this semester.

"It's my last semester and I wanted a class to relieve all the stress I was going through," Martinez said. "I took it because I thought it would be fun and I liked dance, so I wanted to see what this class was about."

Kramer's class is one of two introduction to dance classes being offered this semester. Unlike most academic classes offered, Kramer doesn't insist on a set curriculum every semester. At the beginning of the term, she talks to students about what dances they would like to learn and what interests them.

"I get information from them about what their interests are because, as an introductory class, I want to be able to address their interests," she said. "I don't grade students on how they dance. They have to write papers and take a few quizzes on the information they digest."

"I think her plan was to at least give us a taste of everything. She asked [us] in the first class what we wanted to learn and then we started learning it," said senior Christina Pla, a theatre major who's taking the class as a dance requirement.

Kramer said that history, theory and exams are important but the most important thing that she looked for in students was their participation in class.

Participation was exactly what Rojas said he was looking for when he took the class. 

"When I enrolled in this class, I expected it to be fun and interesting and that's what I got," Rojas said. "Actually, I got more than I expected and can confidently say that it's the only class that I leave with a smile on my face."

Headline: Running back dismissed from team
Subheadline: Backup quarterback to sit out spring drills, expected to return in August
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With spring practices just getting underway, the football team has already made a couple of key offensive changes. 

Ben West, who was the team's leading rusher last season, has been dismissed from the team. Backup quarterback Tavares Kendrick will sit out spring practices due to academics.

In an interview with the Miami Herald, head coach Don Strock said West was "dismissed for violations of team rules and regulations." 

"[Tavares] Kendrick has to take care of his academics and, hopefully, he'll be back in August," Strock said to the Herald.

West played in seven games - including one start - last season, rushed for 537 yards on 98 carries and scored four touchdowns. West rushed for a career-high 214 yards Oct. 1 against Florida A&M and recorded a career-high three touchdowns Nov. 26 against Florida Atlantic.

Kenrick, the backup to starter Josh Padrick, played in three games last year, was 11-for-18 in passing attempts and threw one touchdown and one interception.

The football team, which began spring practice March 28, got into full pads for the first time March 31 and will conclude drills April 15 with the annual Blue and Gold Scrimmage.

Headline: New MLB Steroid investigation overdue, uneccessary
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Over 20 years ago, the baseball world witnessed the game's greatest players take their physical ability to unprecedented heights and didn't say a word. Suddenly, players like Mark McGwire - who came into the league weighing 220 pounds and when he set the homerun record in 1998 weighed 270 - were caught up in a metamorphosis of gigantic proportions.

Despite the obvious cheating going on, owners and managers alike turned their backs on it. Actually, what was seemingly a criminal offense was interpreted as a gift from the heavens back then. Just as baseball was at its downfall in popularity, here were these juiced up heroes ready to carry the game back to the top with their blown-up biceps.

Now, in a desperate attempt to revive his already shattered ego, MLB commissioner Bud Selig has launched an investigation of past steroid use in baseball.

The ol' commish has a knack for being fashionably late on issues, but this time he completely missed the party. They had already cut the cake without him. In fact, they had not only cut the cake; the clowns performed, they had opened presents, played Pin the Tail On the Donkey and passed out some lovely parting gifts.

This season was supposed to be about forgetting the steroids era and moving on. Ivan Rodriguez had already dropped all his alleged steroid weight, Rafael Palmeiro had already wagged his seemingly outraged finger at Congress and got caught and Barry Bonds has already pleaded, "My life is in shambles."

However, as Opening Day approaches, nobody is talking about the Chicago White Sox's chances of repeating or the Atlanta Braves going for 15-straight division titles. Everyone's eyes are glued to this steroid issue that doesn't seem to go away, even when it already has. 

Selig is trying to make the game better by launching a steroid investigation and all he's doing is tarnishing it more.  

What was it that did it for you, Bud? Game of Shadows, the book that just came out about Barry Bonds' alleged steroid use? You mean to tell me that after all that has transpired during the last several years, one book is what made you paranoid? It seems like, once again, you're two steps behind.

The truth is, there is no point in tapping into the steroids issue now. It just seems like an endless case that can never be solved and I blame the owners, the commissioner and especially the MLB players' association.

Dating back to the 1994 strike, it was obvious that the players' association had only one goal in mind: to become the most powerful organization in the world. No matter what the long-term ramifications for the game of baseball, they wanted more and more money and didn't care how they got it. Therefore, they were more than reluctant to let the steroids issue progress because bigger stats meant a bigger fan-base, which meant greater owner revenue, which equaled more money for player salaries.

Thanks to Selig though, the players' association got so much power that the league had to cancel the 1994 World Series, with the strike, and bring the steroid issue to the heights it encountered a couple of years ago.

Now Selig wants to act as if the steroid issue is such a big surprise that he needs to embark on an overdue investigation.

Obviously, there's no way the hierarchy of baseball could be so dumb to not realize players were shooting up in the '80s and '90s. It was such a big deal in the clubhouse back then and there is no way it could've gotten past the eyes of managers or owners.  

The problem is, baseball - and any other professional sport that deals with so much money - is all about gaining an edge on the opponent. Baseball players have been doing it for ages. Whether it's studying game tape, getting scouting reports, corking bats or throwing spitballs, a money hungry organization like Major League Baseball will always be about getting an advantage and steroids are no different.

Managers didn't say anything back then because ordinary players were becoming perennial all-stars and getting their teams in the win column. Owners weren't saying anything because homeruns draw fans and they were bringing in more money. And Bud Selig didn't say anything because having two players break the homerun record in 1998 brought baseball back on top.

So now, more than a year after baseball players met before Congress to "end the steroids issue," it seems as though the problem is just beginning.  By keeping quiet for so long, Selig and the rest of the baseball world has dug itself into a hole they seemingly can never get out of. 

And it's the fans that have to pay the price.

Subheadline: As SGA elections draw closer, students encouraged to vote
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
We could write an editorial every week encouraging the entire student body to voice their opinions as much as possible; whether it is in the form of attending Student Government Association meetings, participating in student events or even submitting a letter to the editor. 

We could sit here until we are blue in the face, or rather have succumbed to a violent case of carpel tunnel, telling you how important it is to be involved.

With a budget of approximately $8.6 million, SGA is, without a doubt, the single most important student-run organization on campus. 

It is an utter shame that last year only 3,158 students voted in the SGA elections - approximately less than 10 percent of the entire student population. 

It is one thing not to attend the meetings SGA holds on a weekly basis, but it is a totally inexcusable thing to ignore their influence and forfeit the power granted to you in the form of a vote. 

In a nutshell, SGA not only distributes funds to many clubs and organizations on campus, it aids in regulating fees and does its best to fight tuition and fee increases proposed by the Florida Legislature. The apathy that envelops the average student when it comes to issues of the utmost importance to them, whether they know it or not, is outright disgraceful. 

It is too often that initiatives, which usually involve money, are passed under the noses of students, without their knowledge, let alone input.

There is a simple solution to this problem. We are not asking you to clear your schedule to make time to make it to the SGA meetings nor are we asking you drop everything and lobby congress alongside its members. 

All we are asking of you is that you take 10 minutes, the usual time it takes to stand in line at Pollo Tropical, and review the platforms and cast your vote for who you feel is the best candidate for the job.

The Beacon has even made it extremely easy for you. We've done all the work already. Just flip to our Beacon Recommends section (next page), and make an informed decision based on the various platforms.

Headline: 2006 BEACON Recommendations
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To coincide with the Student Government Association elections, The Beacon's editorial board releases a list of candidate recommendations for the presidential ticket, representatives-at-large and lower division representatives at University Park and president and vice president at Biscayne Bay Campus. These recommendations are based on an in-depth interview accompanied with questionnaires the editorial board provided to each of the eligible candidates running for office.

University 
Park

Presidential Ticket

Candidates (unopposed)

Alfonso "Alfie" Leon (P)

Providence Okoye (VP)


While the Leon and Okoye ticket is the only one running, we feel that their extensive experience and goals prove that they are worthy of being elected. They seem to have the students best interest in mind with goals such as fighting for lower costs of insurance for international students and enhancing campus safety to better prevent crimes such as car break-ins and assaults.
Leon and Okoye plan on having carts accessible to housing students in order to alleviate the discomfort of carrying many grocery bags or luggage by hand from ones car to their room. 
We like the idea that Leon plans of having clubs and organizations held accountable for the money they are allocated by SGA. He plans on having meetings to make sure they have used the money wisely and for what it was intended for.
Safety is a very important issue and one Leon wants to address. He assures that the Blue garage will be lit at all times (different from now where lights are off by 3 a.m.) and increase awareness of assault and rape throughout campus.
Finally, with a technology fee that is expected to pass across State universities, Leon and Okoye want to lower the extra fee of $295 that is applied to online courses. We feel this is necessary, especially for business majors who have many classes offered only online.

Representative
-at-
Large

Candidates (3 elected)

Ryun Alli

Robert Borgmann

Marbely Hernandez

Arthur "AJ" Meyer

Michelle Oria

Tapeka Pringle

Jennifer Ruiz


With three representative-at-large openings, the decision of recommending Meyer, Hernandez and Ruiz was easy.
Hernandez had feasible goals and an overwhelming personality. What we like about Hernandez, a current lower division representative,  is that she doesn't talk like a politician. Her approachable personality makes her a good candidate to represent the student body.
Goals of hosting an annual FIU College Major Fair - which will help students speak to different administrators from different schools - is a good idea to help undecided students pick a major. Another one of her goals that we like includes making sure that the return of the Game Room is in progress as well as expanding its features. 
She has a lot of marketing ideas and knows how to execute them. We like the way Hernandez wants to hold people accountable. For example, she talked about how she took a photo of a Public Safety vehicle roaming the streets in Hialeah and wondered why a University Public Safety officer would be there instead of patrolling on campus. 
Meyer presented his platform confidently and had some positive goals such as fighting for having the PantherCard system work off campus, testing out Public Safety response time and expanding wireless service. However, the idea of a tram system that would circle the University picking up students that parked far away seems good yet unrealistic.
With funding already a problem for the Golden Panther Express, finding funds for this program seem farfetched. Even a bigger problem than the funds is what street the tram service would operate on. There are only two lanes across UP so a tram system going at slow speeds would in fact slow down students in their own vehicles.
Overall, Meyer's experience as a current lower division representative along with great speaking skills make him a worthy candidate for this position that entitles representing the entire student body.
Picking Ruiz wasn't a clear cut decision as Hernandez and Meyer were but we feel that as a third recommendation, Ruiz is the best choice. Only a freshman, Ruiz is making a big jump running for representative-at-large rather than lower division rep, which may have been a better option. However, she served as an intern for current rep-at-large Leon this year and has a feasible list of goals. 
We like her proposal of an out-reach program to inform students of what's happening at SGA. We also like that she lobbied at the State level and like Meyer, Ruiz wants to push for a wireless access program.
Other candidates: Alli's SGA and leadership inexperience has us wondering why he decided to run as rep-at large rather than lower division rep. Only a freshman, Alli feels his experience as Panther Rage treasurer is enough. However, with no SGA involvement, some of Alli's goals are farfetched and lack research. For example, his plans of having balanced enrollment opportunities for sophomores and juniors, a goal that may sound good on paper but very difficult and complicated to attain. 

The following candidates for rep-at-large did not interview or return a questionnaire to The Beacon: Robert Borgmann, Michelle Oria and Tapeka Pringle.

Recommending Acevedo and LaPointe as lower division representatives was not a difficult decision. 
Acevedo plans on increasing Golden Panther pride through excessive promotion of FIU football games ­- something much needed at this University. In spite of this, he lacked new and creative ideas that would accomplish his goal. His ideas of having more giveaways at games such as bobble heads and T-shirts are being done now and proved ineffective in attracting students. 
His personality was genuine and exuded leadership abilities. We like his ideas of expanding Homecoming events and improving the University's advising program. 
Between LaPointe and Martinelli, we feel that LaPointe is a better candidate. Like Acevedo, she wants to increase Golden Panther pride by getting more students to attend athletic events. We like the fact that she wants to help freshman and sophomores decide on a major, but her goal of having volunteer junior and senior students advise underclassmen is questionable. Also, her goal of having professors give extra credit to students that attend athletic events seems plausible only for freshmen experience classes. We doubt any other class offered at the University would put athletic events over academics. 
Other candidates: Martinelli's goals highly lack development and at first glance may appear student friendly, but are in fact un-ambitious and poorly developed. One of his main goals includes giving free tickets to the FIU vs. University of Miami football game taking place during the Fall semester, something which is already in effect. Giving away free tickets should never be a top goal on anyone's platform.
His proposed "open-door" policy should be expected given his position. However, we like the fact that like many other candidates, Martinelli wants to increase Golden Panther pride and fight tuition increases and fees.

Candidates

Lemar Linton

Zachary Trautenberg

Out of all of our decisions, the decision for president at BBC was the hardest one to make. Both Linton and Trautenberg presented strong but different platforms that are very appealing. 
We recommend Linton due to the experience he has gained as current president and the way he has laid the foundation to build on if elected. 
There have been several goals that Linton accomplished this past year, including the improvements of the cafeteria, the increase in class offering (such as the introduction of several language classes), the continuous beautification of the campus and the increase of support for University athletics through providing shuttle bus services to sporting events at University Park for BBC students.
For this reason, we feel that the goals he has for his platform are attainable and well researched. 
While the idea of having text books tax free seemed far fetched at first glance, Linton made us aware that a bill for this is currently in the State Senate and that he lobbied for this at the State level. He said he will also continue to lobby State legislators for tuition and fee curbing and plans to refurbish the student lounge at Bay Vista with SGA money if necessary.
We also feel that Linton will know what to do with the $9,000 executive discretionary fund that the president receives for his or her one year term. He plans on using it to promote BBC and to sponsor events held there.
A final note that stood out in Linton's plan is the way he wants to continue to have monthly meeting at the Pine Center campus, a way of showing that he cares of the student representation there, which BBC SGA must represent.
The only thing that we disagree in Linton's platform is his goal of getting rid of the plus-minus system of grading. 
We feel that this will make it harder for professors to give students an A and decrease the value of a final grade. If a student earned grades between 95 and 100, he or she deserves more credit than someone who earned straight 90s, thus the plus-minus system distinguishes the elite from ordinary.
Also in the past, University administrators have indicated they do not want the plus-minus system to be eliminated. Moreover, this year, UP SGA President Alex Prado stated that he also did not want the system to end.

Other candidates: The difference between Linton and Trautenberg is that we feel Linton's platform affects more students. 
Although Trautenberg's goals are specific and feasible, they will only benefit a particular group of students (such as improving food services at Pine Center and providing transportation to sporting events at University Park). 
We like that he wants to lobby for an all-you-can-eat cafeteria and invest SGA funds into the student body by purchasing blue books rather than promotional items for SGA. 
We wish Trautenberg could serve as vice president because his goals along with Linton's would complement one another.
Trautenberg wants to work with students to see what the needs are as a student body, something much needed. He also states that he feels SGA funds were not spend correctly this year, and with a current position of finance chair, he may be right. However, money he may consider was spent wrong, may be considered money well spent by someone else.
For Silva, we feel that he doesn't have a solid platform and relies too much on "teamwork" rather than have specific goals - for example anything pertaining to SGA funds and the programs he wants to accomplish. 
He also was unable to answer specific questions relating to money for programs he wants to establish or how he would go about to strengthen the BBC academic advising program, which is one of his listed goals. 
When it came to answering questions regarding to how he plans on accomplishing the goals in his platform, Silva answered "through teamwork," for many. While teamwork is necessary and very important, researched and feasible responses are more essential.
However, we like his idea of creating one university through holding UP and BBC SGA meetings, something Silva wants to accomplish.

Vice president

Candidates

Brent Maximin

Vanessa Robinson

Pamela St. Fleur

Recommending Maximin for vice president was an easy decision. He clearly stood out from the rest of the candidates by being more prepared to discuss his platform.
Maximin has served as vice president during the Spring semester and is running as Linton's unofficial running mate due to the fact BBC SGA does not run as a ticket. During their time together, the Maximin and Linton combination has proved successful. 
We recommend Maximin due to being the only candidate the could back up his goals and our questions. Maximin has good ideas toward the beautification of BBC by painting several walls in Academic I and II. Like Linton, he wants to renovate the student lounge in housing, push for more classes and work on lobbing for tax free books.

Other candidates: Robinson, the unofficial running mate of Trautenberg, has unrealistic goals and unattainable ones - in particular, having the approved medical school at BBC and lowering the Golden Panther Express through left over club money.
Robinson wants to lobby to bring the newly approved medical school to BBC, something that seems highly unlikely. Not only has President Modesto A. Maidique said over and over that the medical school would be constructed at UP, but the actual presentation he presented to the Board of Governors stated that it would officially be built on UP grounds. Thus, it would be absurd to pursue such an improbable goal.
Robinson wants to lower the Golden Panther Express that transports students from UP to BBC and vice versa through left over money from clubs. 
She states that every year many clubs have leftover money and she wants to lobby for that money to be used to lower the Golden Panther Express and provide a shuttle bus that would travel from the Pine Center to UP for athletic events. We feel this funding plan is not as accessible as she may think and may not be enough to accomplish her goals.
For St. Fleur, we feel that she doesn't know how to stop tuition increases, which is one of her goals. She wants to have more SGA exposure, yet she couldn't clearly explain how to go about it. She stated that she agrees with the current health fee increase and we agree with her philosophy of "you can't put a price on health." 
St. Fleur also couldn't explain how she would implement what she calls a "high achievers program" which would recognize talented students. However, St. Fleur's idea of having students submit applications in order to appear on the board is a good start.
