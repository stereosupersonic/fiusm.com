Headline: Don Strock adds 20 with recruiting class
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Twenty high school seniors have pledged to become Golden Panthers this fall by signing Letters-of-Intent to play for FIU on Feb. 2.

Looking ahead at having his second senior class graduate after the 2005 season, Head coach Don Strock's biggest priority in this year's recruiting class was filling in certain positions where the team was lacking depth.

"After this season we'll lose six offensive lineman, possibly seven. We'll also be losing five wide receivers," said Strock on National Signing Day.

Apart from thinking ahead, Strock is also focused on finding players to replace key seniors that will graduate this spring, like running back Rashod Smith, FIU's first 1,000-yard rusher and wide receiver Harold Leath, a two-time second team All-Independent selection.

Two recruits that are expected to contribute immediately include Northeast's running back A'mod Ned and Miami Central's wide receiver Demetrius Byrd.

Ned is a two-time All-Broward performer and was the county's leading rusher last season with 1,635 yards on 202 carries. The four-year prep performer who is 5 feet 9 and weights 185 pounds, also rushed for 25 touchdowns.

Strock spoke highly of Ned.

"We watched him on film a lot and he's a good blocker and a tough guy who catches the ball very well," Strock said.  "Coach [Tony] Nathan likes him a lot."

Ned's high school coach, Adam Ratkevich, knows that the schools that overlooked Ned because of his size will  regret it in the future.

"People don't realize A'mod was both the leading rusher and scorer in Broward County," said Ratkevich. "People underestimated him and I think it will come back and kick them in the butt."

Demetrius Byrd highlights the lone Miami-Dade selection for FIU. The 6-3 receiver caught 37 catches for 860 yards and nine touchdowns for Anthony Saunders' team.

FIU signed a total of five offensive linemen. At the top of the list is another Northeast player, Michael Alls. 

The 6-3, 270 pound player was a first-team all-district and a second-team all-county Large School Football team selection of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. 

The team captain of the Dade/Broward all-star game selected FIU over interest shown by Auburn, Wisconsin, Kansas State and South Carolina among others.

Going into the program's second year of transition in Division I-A, Strock knew that players were beginning to take notice.

"Each year there is more interest in our program. Our move to I-A certainly helps," Strock said. "The young men who are part of our 2005 Golden Panther football team will have the opportunity to play a major college schedule the whole time they are here."

With only one Miami-Dade commitment, Strock said he hopes Miami-Dade coaches and players show interest in FIU next season. 

All the signees attend high school in Florida, with 10 from Broward, three from Palm Beach and one from Miami-Dade. Strock tried finding players in Miami-Dade but didn't succeed.

"It's not that we didn't recruit Dade County," Strock said on the lack of local signings. "We recruit this county very heavily. A lot of players made decisions last night and this morning to go other places. Godspeed to them. We gave them the opportunity to play here, but they decided to go elsewhere. We'll continue to recruit Dade County and hopefully, we'll have a better year next year."

Nevertheless, high school coaches in Broward are already taking notice.

"I think FIU provides an excellent opportunity for a young man to stay in South Florida and play Division I football," Ratkevich said.

Subheadline: One on one with FIU basketball's leading player
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After choosing basketball over baseball, which his brothers play professionally, Ivan Almonte came to FIU from the Dominican Republic and is making a significant impact on the basketball court.

Recruited by coach Rouco, Almonte proves day in and day out what working hard in the sports arena can get you. 

The Beacon spoke with Almonte about his past, the present, and what he would like to do in the future.

Q. After such a promising start to the season, what went wrong?

Well, we had a couple of injuries and a lot of new people on the team. Everybody was trying to get to know each other and get together. Then [there were] injuries and some of the issues that took place with some of the players on the team  having to leave. 

That messed with the chemistry of the team, but we know that we can do better. So now we are down to nine players, and it's hard to practice when you only have eight or nine players in practice. We have to now do all we can, and I know we can get everything together and put all the pieces together. Everybody has to accept their role and play. After that, we are going to get better and win some games. 

Q. What has the team morale been like in the locker room before and after games lately?

Coach Rouco won't let us put our heads down, so even though we are down to eight players, we have been practicing hard, even with injured players. We have been trying to do the best we can, but some games we just didn't play well and others we made some mistakes when we could have won during the seven-game losing streak. There were some games we knew we could have won if we had not made so many mental mistakes. But that is what we are trying to do now: fix those mistakes and get better [and] play hard because that is how Rouco is. He is energetic, and we are going to try and play like that. 

Q. Having come from the Dominican Republic, how and when did you start playing basketball?

Well, there are a lot of basketball players in the Dominican. We have really good players there. I came from a baseball family, but I decided to play basketball. My family was a little mad at me because I have two brothers that play professional baseball, and I could be making a lot of money playing baseball as well. I didn't like to play baseball and I loved to play basketball.

Q. What brought you to FIU?

Coach Rouco knew me and he had seen me playing basketball [in the Dominican Republic]. He brought me here; [first] he fed me to a junior college with one of his friends and now I am here helping him. 

Q. How different is it to play in Miami compared to Iowa?

Well, the weather, and the competition is a little harder because there are more athletic players and every team has better players. My coach last year was the same type of coach Rouco is. So, it's a little different because life in Miami is diffrent, but I like to play here because it's like the same type of city as back home. For me, it's better here. 

Q. What was your most memorable play at Southeastern Community College in Iowa?

I don't know which one, we won two national championships there, so either one of those games. [The first year], I think the first round was really nice, we had a nice team and we only lost one game during the whole thing. We knew we could do it the second year with so many players coming back. It was really nice to play there and win two championships and have the support of all the fans. They have a really nice school over there. 

Q. You still have one season left after this one. What do you hope to accomplish?

[I want to] just come back next year, and I know Sergio will bring in some more players that will want to play for him-players he has recruited himself. Some of the players that are coming back [are] me, Ish [Ismael N'Diaye] and some more players. 

I know we are going to have a good team. We are going to play very hard from the beginning and start putting everything together   so we can have a really nice run throughout the season.  

Q. Where do you see yourself after your career is finished as a Golden Panther?

Well, I want to keep working hard and get the best of what I can. Hopefully, I can play basketball because it's what I like. If I can go play professional basketball somewhere I would do it. But if I can't, then that's why I am here in school studying and trying to get the best I can from the school. 

That way when I finish my career playing basketball I know I will be able to do something; I will be able to get a job somewhere outside basketball.  

Q. What do you think this team's biggest necessity is for next season?

We need big guys and we need more shooting. That's been our biggest problem this season. Ish [N'Diaye] has been shooting well the last couple of games, but Junior [Matias], who is our pure shooter on the team, has been hurt for much of the time. We need to put  together guys that want to work hard and play hard.   

Q. How is coach Rouco different from coaches you have had in the past? 

Coming from the Dominican, coaches play a little differently because of the situation there. They know that players have to go and work outside of basketball so there isn't really enough time to practice. Here [at FIU] and in junior college in Iowa it was not really much different. Coach O'Brien [Southeastern CC], he was just like coach Rouco in terms of basketball and playing hard and giving your best effort to win. Coach Rouco is really energetic and, like what happened against Arkansas-Little Rock in the first-half, he tried to challenge me, because I didn't have a good first-half. He just challenges you every time he can and tries to get the best out of you.

Headline: Election won on moral value issues
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For those of us studying politics or for the casual nightly news-viewer, whenever the 2004 presidential election comes up  in conversation we undoubtedly hear those two, now infamous words: moral values.  

President Bush won re-election because moral values were a more important deciding factor in the votes of Americans than any other issue, including terrorism, healthcare and the war in Iraq.

These voters favored Bush 80-18% according to CNN's exit polling data. 

Apparently voters that thought what Steve and Bob do behind closed doors is more important than our homeland security, provided Bush with the margin of victory.

Republicans have done a superb job of making faith, God, Jesus and morality conservative terms. Pro-life and anti-gay marriage positions supposedly make one "moral." However, is that the true composition of morality? 

Ask a conservative the meaning of morality and they'll likely tell you to turn to the Bible and study the teaching of Jesus. I am a product of 12 years of Catholic school. This is something I have done, and my conclusion is way off base from that of your traditional Republican.

The four Gospels in the New Testament provide the most direct, detailed accounts in the life of Jesus. Reading the Gospels allows one to appreciate Jesus's most basic teachings: clothe the naked, feed the hungry, cure the sick and treat others as you would want to be treated. 

These are what I call "Gospel values." Unlike conservatives' flawed understanding of morality, Democrats have historically supported policies that promote equality for all Americans  - regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation. Ironically, Republicans have consistently used such positions as political ammo to attack Democratic policies. 

Christ says that we are all equal in the eyes of God, so when conservatives support policies that state otherwise, I cannot judge that to be moral.

   With a vast majority of Americans possessing a source of morality, they believe in the proper funding of the public education system. 

They also believe in the right for all Americans to have access to affordable healthcare, a living wage and equality for all,  regardless of age, race or gender. 

However, with these such issues facing America today, the Bush Administration has immorally turned its back on these problems and now closes its eyes and prays that they'll go away.

Some leading educators have found Bush's heralded No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act underfunded to the tune of $27 billion. Forty-five million Americans lack any type of health coverage while the average American's income steadily decreases, which plays a role in the fact that the poverty rate in America continues to rise at an astounding rate. 

Additionally, in today's society women still earn only 75 cents for every dollar men earn. 

You may say to yourself, "this isn't moral, what has our 'compassionate conservative' president done to address these things?" 

The president has continually denied any problems in the funding of NCLB, though at least 11 state legislators have passed bills denouncing the law. 

He still opposes the importation of cheaper prescription drugs from Canada because he claims they may not be safe. News flash: There is not a shred of evidence they are unsafe. However, allowing Americans access to these drugs will put a dent in the profits made by drug companies here in America - the same corporations that donated millions to the president's campaign efforts. 

Finally, the president has supported cutting overtime pay to millions of hardworking Americans such as nurses and firefighters. This has resulted in many of the brave men that ran into the towers on 9/11 losing their jobs. I insist this is not moral.

As Republicans continue to insist ownership of morality, their actions do not support their claims. I encourage the Democratic Party and all its members to stake a claim in the Gospel values. These are values that transcend all religions and can be accepted by Americans of all faiths. 

Unlike the conservative agenda, Democratic policies, speeches and votes back up our words. This is not straying from the traditional Democratic platform, it is simply an adjustment in how the message is portrayed. 

If Democrats stand true to their principles and refuse to allow conservatives the inaccurate and unfair claim to morality, the destructive rule of the Republican party will soon start to unravel in the face of the truth.

Former FIU student relates to motorcycle accident obituary, sends prayers

I was extremely heartbroken after reading the obituary in the previous issue of The Beacon and  I wanted to pass on a message to the victim's family.  My younger brother recently survived a motorcycle accident and is currently handicapped (doctors say he should be walking again soon).  

My family and I are thankful he survived, but it's quite an adjustment coping with this.  

He's just not the same person anymore.  He's over six feet tall and now he can't even stand up.  I wanted to send my condolences to the Gomez family. I am utterly sorry for their loss. My brother also purchased his motorcycle against my parents' wishes and wrecked it only a few weeks after getting it.  

I don't think I'll ever be able to look at another motorcycle or rider the same way again.  My prayers are with the family as they learn to cope with such a precious loss.

I feel the necessity to speak up after the trauma my family has experienced due to my brother's accident. No one deserves to go through this pain and suffering, especially when they're so young! My brother is 23 and he graduated from the University of Tampa in the Spring of 2004.  

He was about to start his military career in the army when he got hurt. I will say a special prayer for their family -keep your faith and be encouraged. You are not alone.

Monstrosity angers faculty member, junkheap not art

FIU has gained a certain level of fame with its University Art Park campus, and deservedly so. Unfortunately, this achievement has been cheapened lately due to a poor decision to erect the monstrosity entitled Mixed Steel Media, in the quadrangle in front of the Primera Casa Building. 

Art it is not; rather, it resembles junkyard discards (which is probably what it is made of). If the intent was to display Haitian art, then it would be far better to direct people to the library where beautiful Haitian paintings have been hung from time to time. So, let's remove this rusty erector set in the very near future. 

And please, don't justify  this junkheap with the cliche "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."

FIU Faculty Member

Headline: SHAFTED! Nothing is free on the internet
Subheadline: Free offers on the Internet con student's money
Author: Leonor Guerrera / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
You know that old cliché that if it is too good to be true, it probably is?  Well, the cliché is true and it happened to me.  Those of you who surf the Internet regularly have probably seen those banner ads for a free computer; usually they want to give you a free laptop, sometimes it's a desktop. I went for the free laptop.

This is what happened: I saw a banner at a web page, either at Yahoo or at Bellsouth.net, advertising a free laptop. 

I clicked on the banner and was transported to a web page that wanted me to buy a number of products and services before they would give me a "free" laptop.  The company called itself eMarketresearchGroup

There were several pages of products and services to buy, and as I went from page to page, the products got more and more expensive. 

Some of the more expensive products were products that I didn't want, like a credit card with a fee of $200, or a satellite service, which was more than I wanted to pay every month, and so on.

The products that I ended up buying were the following:  

1. A subscription to BMG Music Service; they sent me seven CDs and charged me about $20 for shipping.

2. A subscription to Columbia House DVD Club; they sent me five DVDs and charged me about $13 for shipping

3. A face cream called Nexiderm from a company called Boehm-Ritter. The cream was "free," but I had to pay for the $9.95 shipping charges.

4. A subscription to Direct TV, which I later cancelled with no penalty.

Of the above, the face cream company turned out to be the most obnoxious. They charged an additional $49.95 to my credit card, for an alleged subscription to their product, without my authorization.  

I had to complain to the credit card company, which in turn changed my credit card number and issued me a new credit card.  That issue has not been resolved, and I may have to file a complain with the police, in order to get that charge of $49.95 credited back to my credit card.

I have since found that there are several companies on the Internet claiming that they will give you a  free computer.  

I even went to ebay.com, an auction website, where I tried to find a cheap laptop. 

Instead, I found some people are auctioning the Internet address of those companies that alleged to give you a free laptop.  Having learned from my previous experience, I didn't fall for that.

I didn't get a free computer and now I have close to $100 in charges on my credit card.  The moral of the story is that if you have to spend money to get something for free, then it is not free.  

If any one has managed to get the "free" computer, the laptop or desktop, please send me an e-mail at:  lguer004@fiu.edu.

Headline: Halting of program results in protest
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Beneath light but steady rain, graduate students from the FIU Speech and Language Pathology program chanted, waved colorful signs and paraded around University Park's Graham Center. This was done in an attempt to stop what they believe is the closing of their department by university administrators.

"We're protesting that we need this program in our community, a program that will benefit many people in need, and that despite this, we're being shut down," said Shara Segal, a student completing  the first year of her master's program and an organizer of the event.

The 25 students enrolled in  the program stated that they had been organizing the protest since Ronald Berkman, dean of the college of Health and Urban Affairs, announced on Jan. 27 that their department could face termination due to financial problems.

According to the students, the administrators told them that the program would be closed because the department needs to generate a certain amount of revenue which has not yet been met.

"[FIU] is saying they're shutting the program because of financial reasons, but yet they still have money for things like the football team," said Christine Aguilera, a student in her first year of the graduate program. "They have money for other areas, but something that's needed for the community, they can't seem to find the money for that."

Speech and language pathologists are educated to assess speech and language development and to treat language and speech disorders in infants and the elderly.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 26,000 speech pathologists will be needed to fill the demand between 2002 and 2012 with 53.1 percent more job openings than job available workers in Florida.

Applicants for the positions are only accepted if they have graduated from an accredited master's program, a status reached by FIU during the summer of 2004 when the five-year-old program received full accreditation from the American Speech and Hearing Association.

"If they are willing to cut an accredited program that's only been around for a short time and is just now beginning to flourish, what's going to keep them from going and cutting the next school when they need the money?," Aguilera said.

However, when asked about the protests and the closing of the program, Berkman claimed that the students' reactions were exaggerated and that the program would not be eliminated.

According to Berkman, the university made a decision to temporarily halt the program due to internal problems that might endanger its new accreditation.

To keep its accreditation, the department must meet certain criteria, including the maintenance of a fixed set of faculty members.

Earlier last year, two of the program's professors, Lamieda McNeally and Lynn Ramos, left the university, leaving only two tenured professors and one clinical professor within the department.

"My primary responsibility is to make sure the program stays accredited and [that] there is a faculty to teach the students to get them their degree. That's a significant challenge when we only have a limited faculty," Berkman said.

The dean also stated that the financial reasons behind the actions taken did not come from problems the university may be having but, from a lack of expected revenue from the program.

Berkman said that they anticipated that they would have revenue approaching $30,000 from the  Hearing and Language Clinic for its first year and a total of $130,000 after two years. 

The clinic has only yielded $23,000  and the faculty within the department has not brought in any outside sponsored research through grants and contracts.

"I hope we [will] find a solution to enhance the revenue in the program and continue to run it," Berkman said. 

He would not state how the revenue's increase will be reached.

But, according to ASHA's website at www.asha.org, a program cannot maintain its accreditation if annual fees are not paid. 

A school may keep its status if placed under a two year or more probation in which accreditation standards may once again be reached, but there is no word if  FIU's program will go through this phase at all.

The dean also responded to accusations that the university is eliminating a program beneficial to its planned medical school proposal by stating that the Speech and Language Pathology program would have no correspondence with the school.

"I can tell you that SLP is not a fundamental program for a medical school. It is not part of the core curriculum of a medical school-most medical schools have no speech language departments," Berkman said. "That's not to say that the SLP could or would, down the line, have some relationship with the medical school even though it is not a required course."

For now, Berkman assures students who are afraid that they will be scattered to other colleges that the final decision to fully close the program has not been reached and that they will all be able to graduate with their degree.

No decision has been reached about the future of the incoming class who turned in their admission applications before the Feb. 1 deadline.

"There have been a number of programs at FIU that have, for one year suspended admissions and then restarted the program, and I'm not even sure if we're doing that," Berkman said. 

"My hope is that we won't do that, but we kind of have to solve one problem at a time."

Headline: Cali rapper plays the PR game
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Mixed reviews. That's the way to describe The Game's debut album entitled The Documentary.

Labeled as the next great California rapper, much hype was put on The Game in delivering the  highly anticipated West Coast release since Dr. Dre's Chronic 2001.

The Game, who did not begin rapping until two years ago, released the album as a member of G-Unit.

Under the direction of Dr. Dre, The Game put together a first class collaboration of producers and artist on the album.

While it doesn't hurt to have big-name producers like Kanye West, Eminem, Timbaland, Just Blaze, Hi-Tek and Dr. Dre on the album, it did hurt to have so many collaborators. Most of them seem to steal the spotlight away from him and out flow him.

In the song, "Hate it or Love it" and "How We Do" for instance, it almost feels as if it should have been a 50 Cent song rather than The Game. Not only does 50 Cent sing the chorus in both songs, but he also delivers too many verses. 

In "Higher," 50 Cent spits the opening verse and then the chorus, ultimately leading him to take over the track.

Even The Game  acknowledges that collaborators are taking over his album.

In "We Ain't," produced by Eminem, the Detroit rapper outflows The Game, leading him to mock himself and say, "Someone get Dre on the phone quick, Em just killed me on my own sh*t."

The best lyrical song on the album is the title track. The Game raps, "I'm ready to die without a reasonable doubt/smoke chronic and hit it doggystyle before I go out/until they sign my death certificate/all eyez on me/I'm still at it illmatic/and that's The Documentary."

While the Game's flow is pretty good, the problem is that he compares himself to too many rap legends - legends who've been around for a long time and have proved themselves.

In the above verse, The Game mentions albums and songs of legends such as Tupac, Jay-Z, Ice Cube, Nas and Snoop Dogg. It almost seems as if he is trying to put himself among the best. He also calls himself rap's MVP even though this is his first nationally released album by a major label.

Listening to the album feels like an infomercial for products. The Game should open his own store and sell LP's from NWA, Biggie, Tupac and Jay-Z, Nike Air Force Shoes, Gold Daytons, Coca-Cola and Low Low's. All are mentioned in at least 95 percent of his songs.

The Game is also trapped in the 90s, with constant references to Tupac, Biggie and Eazy-E and Dre. He mentions how he wishes NWA would have gotten back together and how he would have told Tupac to be careful of getting shot on the day of his murder.

The entertaining album will keep your head banging. The production is sleek and the verses are real with a true gangsta who hangs around with Bloods and Crypts, this album has the real side of the streets, not the Gucci and Prada that other rappers flow about.

Headline: Opera readies grand season
Author: Shane Howard / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
South Florida is more than just beaches, award shows and a haven for movie shoots. The Florida Grand Opera has offices in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. The FGO performs main stage productions at the Miami-Dade County Auditorium and the Broward Center for the Performing Arts. 

"Opera is one of the world's greatest art forms, one who considers themselves really educated. You need to give it a try," said Justin Moss, managing director for their marketing and communications department. 

The FGO's season runs from November to May and each opera does five performances in Miami and two in Fort Lauderdale.

According to Moss, opera singers cannot sing on consecutive nights because it puts a strain on their vocal cords, show is done three times a week.

Most students have the wrong idea about opera. 

"I think boredom. I think glass breaking. I think fat people," said Sawra Spence who majors in business and sees opera as incoherent.

"If you have insomnia, go to an opera," said Jessica Berman, who majors in print journalism.

According to Moss, the FGO audience looks just like the demographics here in South Florida; young, largely Hispanic people who are a big part of the audience. Then there are those like Yvette Gutierrez who go to the opera twice a year. After watching "Madame Butterfly" at the Broward location Gutierrez said,"It was very good; excellent."

Each opera is sung in the language in which it was written, but English translations are projected onto a screen above the stage while the performance takes place. An hour before performances, free opera previews explain the plot and the entertaining stories surrounding the opera. 

The FGO also helps young singers with its young artists studio. It consists of about 10 singers each year. The studio helps the college or conservatory graduates make the transition from an academic environment to a professional career. The FGO provides them with vocal coaching and training along with acting, movement and dance studies. 

"Paul Bunyan" is currently in production. The remaining shows this season are: "The Magic Flute," "Lucia di Lammeramoor" and "A Masked Ball." Ticket prices range from $19 to $150 and can be ordered online at www.fgo.org or by calling 1-800-741-1010. Student rates are available.

Life after college is uncertain. When it's time to graduate, you walk down the aisle, grab your diploma, throw your cap and then it hits you. What are you going to do for the rest of your life? Career Services will try to ease that stress when the 2005 Spring Career Fair is held at the University Park campus on Feb. 15.

Senior Director of Career Services, Olga Magnusen, said that the employment market has improved significantly. "The job market is the best it has been over the last three years," said Magnusen. 

The fair also offers an excellent networking opportunity for students.

Students will be able to speak with representatives from Anheuser-Busch, the Broward Sheriff's Office, Burdines-Macy's, Carnival Cruise Lines, FPL, General Electric, IBM and many other prospective employers. 

One hundred and thirty-two companies, the maximum number possible, have registered and confirmed that they will attend. Unfortunately, Career Services cannot guarantee that all the companies will show up. Absent representatives was an issue at last semester's fair.

Amanda Ramirez, majoring in print journalism, did not attend last semester's fair and has no plans to attend.

"I do not think there are enough employers in the journalism field and that is the reason why I never attend," said Ramirez. 

Despite some students disinterest in the fair, Career Services recommends that everyone come out, because there will be a company representative present for every major.

The night before the fair FIU President, Modesto A. Maidique, will host a reception at his home for employers attending the fair.

In order for students to get the most from the career fair, Magnusen offers these tips:

*Come in business attire.

*Bring 25-30 copies of your resume.

*Review the list of the employers attending the fair by looking at the Career Services website: www.fiu.edu/~career

*Identify prospective employers which interest you and do research on them.

*Follow up with the employers that you meet at the fair and indicate your interest in working with them or having an internship with them.

The Spring Career Fair will take place from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Golden Panther Arena. The fair is open to all FIU students and alumni. Students will not be admitted if they are not in business attire. For more information on the Spring Career Fair and Career Services go to www.fiu.edu/~career.

Headline: Fatal accident takes life of charming faculty member
Author: Ana Sanchez / BBC Editor
&nbsp;
Student's who walked past Biscayne Bay Campus' Center On Aging would often find 86-year-old Pearl Ferber sitting at her computer typing away.  

She still walked up the stairs in Academic One every day and took walks every morning while listening to country music on her headphones. She always wore matching jewelry and with a coquettish smile she would boast, "I still have all my teeth."

On the morning of Jan. 31, Ferber's husband was driving her to work when an SUV drove into the passenger's side of the vehicle on the corner of Northeast 151 St., at the entrance to BBC. 

Ferber was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital where she passed away. Her husband was injured in the accident but survived. 

As of press time and despite several phone calls, The Beacon was unable to reach the North Miami Police department in regards to the accident.

Coworkers were shattered when they heard the news.

"This morning I had to go by her desk and I walked all the way around. I couldn't bare it. Every day I would pass by and I'd say 'Hey young lady' and she would laugh. I'm going to miss that," said close friend Evelyn Cawley, program pssistant for GEARUP Programs in the College of Education.

Ferber worked at FIU for 21 years as a secretary. Born in Milledgeville, Ga., Ferber was raised in Atlanta and then moved to New York where she worked as a secretary for an insurance company. 

She married and had two children. She also has one grandson. 

"You could always depend on Pearl. She had such a good sense of humor and was fun to talk to," said Ann Goraczko, associate director for the Institute for Public Opinion Research/Journalism and Mass Communications.

A loyal member of the Democratic Party and an admirer of President Bill Clinton, Ferber was active in a community organization in Concerned Citizens, a community service organization in Sunny Isles Beach.

"At one of the Concerned Citizens meetings the commissioner asked, `Mrs. Ferber when are you going to retire?` and her response was, `When you retire, then I will retire,'" Cawley said.

Ferber's coworker's described her as a consumate professional who was always willing to learn new things. 

"She never came in late. She never called in sick. Last week she worked an hour more so she could attend a luncheon this week," Cawley said. "It was difficult for her to learn Panthersoft but she did it; no complaints and always working with a smile."

Ferber was very sociable. She still kept in touch will her grade school friends and dined at the Sweet Tomato on weekends. She was fond of traveling and planned trips every year. On Fridays, she attended Tai Chi class. 

 For her 86th birthday, her coworkers organized a birthday party where Vice Provost Raul Moncarz gave Ferber an award for her demonstration of excellence in the work place. 

"She was always thinking of other people. She represented what the university is: service, understanding and always having a good disposition toward the present and the future," Moncarz said. 

Services were held at Levitt Weinstein Funeral home in Miami Beach on Feb. 2.

"She was one of those rare people who enriched all of our lives by just knowing her," said Betty Ryan, an administrative assistant.

Headline: Loews Hotel's CEO promotes new book at FIU
Author: Damian Grass / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Jonathan M. Tisch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Loews Hotels, was surprised when he received a huge "We're glad you're here" welcome cheer from students and faculty in FIU's School of  Hospitality and Tourism Management, when he arrived to promote his newest book, "The Power of We: Succeeding Through Partnerships," on Friday, Jan. 28.

Tisch is a returning guest speaker as part of the Spring 2005 Dean's Lecture Series.

"It is such a pleasure being back here to speak to you all," said Tisch to the 500 plus attendants at the Kovens Conference Center.

The top leading industrialist shared stories of his childhood vacations spent at family owned hotel properties, and learned how the employees made it all happen.

"I was answering phone calls at the front desk when I was seven," Tisch said.

Decades later, Tisch's experiences and succeeding efforts have made Loews Hotels one of the leading luxury hotel chains today. 

The third-generation hotel mogul targeted up-and-coming leaders of the hospitality industry with the importance of starting at the bottom.

"Before you can become the president, a senior executive or even a CEO of a major corporation," he said, "you need to know every aspect of the company."

To prove his point, Tisch jumped on the reality-show wagon and starred in the first episode of TLC's "Now Who's Boss," where for five days chief executives must trade in their iron-pressed suits for polyester uniforms and work as lower-level employees for their own companies.

The 790-room beachfront Loews Hotel on Collins Avenue was Tisch's choice for a new career change.

 "I was a room service waiter, housekeeper, member of the bell staff, front-desk clerk, engineer and pool attendant," Tisch said while counting his fingers. "I did it all."

He said that it took him "three hours to clean up just one room."

According to Tisch, Miami Beach was in dire need of a makeover for more than 30 years. As one of the nation's leaders of the travel and tourism industry, Tisch had his eye on restoring and expanding what used to be St. Moritz hotel, located in the Art Deco district.

In order to persuade the Miami Beach commission board to agree on a new development project for a Loews Hotel in the mid 90s, the determined CEO sported a blonde wig, long skirt and high heels as he asked the street locals for their opinions on the idea ... while being videotaped.

After viewing the tape, the commission stated in the following meeting that if a chief executive officer is willing to go "in drag to show such determination and passion for this community, then we are proud to support him," Tisch said.

He concluded his lecture with his important rule of, "understanding your responsibility to assist your community." 

Loews Hotels presently owns and operates 18 hotels and resorts throughout the United States and two in Canada.

The Loews Hotels' latest venture is a renovated 277-room historic European-style Don Cesar Beach Resort in St. Pete Beach, FL. For more information on the Loews Hotel's information, sign on to www.loewshotels.com.

Subheadline: Some favorite things by Leoncio Alvarez - Opinion Editor
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
1. CONVERSE CHUCKS
What can be better than moderately expensive shoes that come in every possible color and can be color coordinated with every piece of clothing in your closet? Not much I tell you.

2. THE SIMS 2
The only game that I can honestly say has kept me from eating, sleeping and even urinating for a good two days in a row. Do I regret it? Not a bit.

3. FIONNA APPLE
A depressed anorexic woman who sings about her many heartaches and how men suck. Ironically, she still has obsessed fans who track her every move, even after she appeared on MTV in a dress without shaving her armpits.

4. MY CHILDHOOD OBSESSION WITH THE SPICEGIRLS
Five, sometimes four, British women who sing poorly out of tune and made a poor attempt at a movie and even a video game, every fifth grader's dream come true. A true example of 15 minutes of fame.

5. CHEESECAKE
As a young child, watching "The Golden Girls" with my mother brought me to have a never-ending love affair with cheesecake. Funny how I could never finish one whole slice. Oh, but how I try.

Headline: Super Bowl ought to be super clean
Author: Gail Pennington / St. Louis Post-Dispatch
&nbsp;
Unless Paul McCartney moons the crowd, the halftime show at this year's Super Bowl will be as squeaky clean as the NFL can make it.

No tape delay will be in place during the halftime, which also includes singer Alicia Keyes. But the NFL says it is reviewing "all facets" of the halftime performances in advance.

After last year's outcry about Janet Jackson's infamous wardrobe malfunction, commercials for Super Bowl XXIX, airing Feb. 6 on Fox, came under scrutiny as well. So audiences won't see Mickey Rooney's bare, 84-year-old backside (the Airborne spot didn't pass muster) or a Bud Light ad parody showing a stagehand ripping Jackson's top with a beer bottle. (Anheuser-Busch agreed with Fox and the NFL not to air the parody during the game but its getting even more publicity on the budweiser.com website.)

For fear of offending mass audiences, Fox has gone so far as to rename its "Best Damn Sports Show Period," usually seen on Fox Sports Net, as the "Best Darn Super Bowl Road Show Period."

Viewers certainly shouldn't expect to see anything like the "Desperate Housewives" promo-parody that stirred up controversy during a "Monday Night Football" broadcast in November.

The spot was scripted by "Housewives" creator Marc Cherry at the request of ABC and wasn't intended to be controversial Cherry told TV critics meeting in Los Angeles. "We were just that stupid," said Cherry.

The spot was supposed to feature "Housewives" co-star Nicollette Sheridan with "MNF" announcer John Madden. "A woman as glorious-looking as Nicollette Sheridan throwing herself at John Madden is just funny," Cherry said.

In his spot, "the towel wasn't dropped at the end, and there wasn't a jump into the arms," Cherry Said. After Madden couldn't appear and was replaced by Terrell Owens of the Philadelphia Eagles, "suddenly this thing became this other thing that it wasn't really intended to be."

Cherry said he felt bad that some viewers were offended, but added, "I didn't really realize `Monday Night Football' was such the family viewing experience. I wouldn't let my 5-year-old watch beer commercials and big-breasted cheerleaders every Monday, but that's me."

Headline: How fame went to Freddie's head
Author: Elizabeth Wellington / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
When Eagles receiver Freddie Mitchell flung off his helmet at the end of the NFC championship game, fans gasped.

Announcers stumbled over themselves trying to describe what was going on in Mitchell's head.

Now, we know the hairstyle is a Frohawk. The cornrows were braided up to the crown of Mitchell's head, exploding into a bugged-out bush, thanks to Brandi James, a stylist at Accents Unisex Salon in Willingboro, N.J.

"I've been to Sweden... and Italy. I saw people there, and their hair was faded, with a little left on the top," said Mitchell after practice recently, wearing a brown leather jacket and blue jeans. Five days after the win, Mitchell's cornrows were slightly matted, and the Afro had been pulled back into a ponytail.

"Some of the looks were like mullets. I decided it looked kind of fly. Now everybody is trying to get the Frohawk," Mitchell said.

Omar Simmons, the salon's owner, said Mitchell told him he wanted to look like Mr. T's character, Clubber Lang, in Rocky III.

"The Eagles were about to enter the battle of their lives," Simmons said. "We thought that was the perfect look for the game."

Last week, about a dozen men requested the Frohawk, he said. The look costs $45.

Simmons is working on a hot Super Bowl look for Mitchell and quarterback Donovan McNabb. McNabb was in the salon recently, getting his braids done.

"This look came about because of the love of Philadelphia," Simmons said. "We want to give the fans something to talk about and enjoy."

In Jacksonville, Mitchell plans to wear T-shirts with "interesting sayings," which will be available on his Web site, www.freddiemitchell.com, which launched this week.

"People just want to know what Freddie Mitchell is thinking," Mitchell said. "Where in the world is Freddie Mitchell right now?"
