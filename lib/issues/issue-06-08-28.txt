Subheadline: Ethics of registration seat holding questionable
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's the day before sophomore nursing major Kathie Warfel's registration appointment, and she has several tentative class schedules highlighted in pink and splayed out in front of her. Her planning has been somewhat complicated by the fact that several required classes for nursing majors are offered primarily at BBC, but it is especially complicated because many of them have filled up quickly.

"Way before my registration date, I noticed the classes I needed were already full," Warfel said. "I panicked because I didn't have that many to choose from."

This is true for many sophomores because they are at the bottom of the registration totem pole.

Out of frustration, many students resort to asking friends with earlier registration appointments to hold spots for them in the classes they need most.

Interestingly enough, many students are aware of the widespread custom of spot-holding, but the majority of faculty and administrators seem to be in the dark about the practice. When alerted about it, faculty and administrators alike tend to ask in wonder, "How do students manage to do that?"

The truth is that they've been managing it for a while, and while some students may not have considered the negative repercussions, in the long run excessive spot-holding can become unfair to the student body as a whole.

Students without "friends in high places" could potentially be harmed in a system where appointments are assigned in an attempt to make registration as fair a process as possible.

Peer advisor Alejandra Maruri agreed the practice is questionable. "It's a very iffy situation, especially if you're doing it every semester; it's not fair to others," Maruri said.

Dr. Carmela McIntire, Chairperson of the English Department, does not excuse the habit, but is sympathetic to the needs of students.

"I don't think spot-holding is a good idea, but it's an act of desperation. FIU almost sets up a culture of doing what you need to do to get what you need. We're a string-pulling culture," McIntire said. "What that tells me is that we have a problem that the university needs to address."

She further explained that as much as the faculty and administration desire to help students attain the classes they seek, they too face obstacles of their own.

"There are room limitations. We can't override all the time because there simply isn't space," McIntire said.

It is made tougher, in fact, by the impossibility of obtaining specific statistics on how often spot-holding occurs. Without these numbers, administration can do little to prevent it from happening. Donna Yff, supervisor at the registrar's office, explained why.

"The problem is it's gone on for years. It's not really something that the university can stop because there's no way of knowing if the student really needs the class or not," Yff said.

For the sake of students who feel the system is unjust, she attempts to clarify why registration appointments are assigned the way they are in the first place: Freshmen, Seniors, Juniors, and then Sophomores.

"There has to be priority. One of the things used for priority is GPA. Freshmen and Seniors usually aren't problems because they don't register for the same classes. Why should Sophomores have advantage over Freshmen and Seniors or over students with higher GPAs?"

The logic behind the order is that Freshmen need their basic courses, Seniors need certain classes to graduate, and Sophomores can afford to be last because they still have two years left at the university. Yff asks students to imagine just how unfair registration would be if it were a free-for-all instead of operating on priority.

Although the university cannot prevent spot-holding completely, Yff said that online registration has significantly reduced it.

"Online, I don't know how effective [spot-holding] is. You'd have to be very good at dropping and adding immediately. The online system makes it a lot more fair."

The issue of spot-holding seems to show one glaring trend: students and administration see each other as "the other side," when ideally they should be on the same page, working together to see each other's perspectives more clearly and make registration a more efficient and fair process.

Headline: How To...a humor column
Subheadline: Staying awake for class by any means
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
There aren't a lot of things worth staying awake for. Jay Leno's sad attempts at humor, 3 a.m. post-clubbing trips to Denny's where you wait an hour for cold fries served by a woman who has what can only be a beard, or watching your boyfriend beat the hardest level on Zelda for the 17th time are all good examples.

Classes, however, are a different story. Although many professors force you to meet the sandman with their monotone voices and disgust with their jobs, staying awake is crucial to the big picture: getting good grades, graduating, making the big bucks, trophy spouse. 

Many of us are not morning people. For me, 8 a.m. classes are the equivalent of plucking out each arm hair one by one. Unfortunately, many freshmen don't know any better, and many seniors must take them because, of course, it's the last class they need to graduate. Here are some tips on how to make ecstasy out of the agony.



Traditional method



    Caffeine is life. It's the element that brings most of the world out of its zombie state. Many say the long term effects of coffee and caffeinated beverages are negative and can lead to gastrointestinal disturbance and sleep disorders. Frankly, I'd be more concerned with the gastrointestinal disturbance that comes from eating in our food court. 

    FIU's many coffee outlets makes it more than easy to be able to consume a cup of joe or two, or twelve, before jetting to class. Be warned, though, getting a coffee at school can be comparable to standing in line at registration: lots of people behind a counter working at double speed, charging four times its cost to get a half-assed product. 

This may lead you to take more extreme measures.



Experimental method



When left with little options, sometimes you have to get creative. If I'm in a particularly sleep-inducing class, I like to jam a pen in my thigh ever so delicately. If you're one of those anti-bleeding types, you can also have ice ready to slip underneath your feet. The only downside to that is tripping over yourself once class is over because you've become uncomfortably numb.

If visualization works for going to sleep, like picturing sheep jumping over a fence, there must be a way it works for staying awake. Hmm… I guess the opposite of a sheep is a komodo dragon or a chupacabra. So, picture one of those moonwalking and tripping backwards over that same fence. Yeah, that works.



When all else fails…



If by the off chance you do end up falling asleep, you need to be prepared for a quick response if you're called on by the professor. Posing grand scheme questions is a good way to get around a public chastising. When the professor asks you if you were sleeping, you say "I was just wondering what it all means in a global sense" or "How did you deal with this in your work experience?" Two things professors love: pontificating and talking about themselves.

Realistically, it's true that there can be no substitute for a good night's sleep and a good breakfast. But if you really need sleep, you can always buy those joke glasses with the eyes painted open on the lenses. It's a shot. Good luck.

Headline: A guide to cheap and convenient eating
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. & Alicia Bustamante / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Luckily for budget-conscious students, University Park has a cluster of restaurants within walking distance or reasonable driving distance that can be visited instead of the typical fast food joints. When students have the time, they can forgo the on-campus food options and take a break from a full-time 8-hour class schedule. Here's a rundown of where to grab a bite when your appetite gets the best of you:



Publix:
While not exactly a restaurant, Publix actually has some great options for students who want to prove to themselves that they can cook something besides Easy Mac. If you want a sub and are sick of Subway, the deli has several subs available with your choice of either Publix or Boar's Head meat. The supermarket chain also has sushi, ready-made fruit bowls and salads, and individual hot meals in the deli. The downsides are the crazy parking lot filled with student drivers and the waiting in line, which eventually starts feeling like an eternity. Regardless, there's no other nearby place you could go to and order a box of cookies as well as a tub of potato salad after you've failed a test.



Natural Chicken Grill:
Located in the same shopping plaza as Smoothie Time, this healthier and tastier alternative to burgers and fries specializes in chops (the mix of your choice of chicken or churrasco, beans, rice and veggies). Whether you're in the mood for a Latin Chop (which unsurprisingly includes black beans) or a basic Natural Chop, the menu is diverse enough to satisfy most stomachs. Even if you're not interested in chops, the restaurant will win you over with its succulent pitas and delicious curry mustard sauce. It's neither fancy nor exotic, but Natural Chicken Grill offers hungry college students some tasty food at decent prices (around $7).



Moe's Southwest Grill: 
Although Taco Bell is a few blocks away from UP, students should give this Mexican restaurant a chance because of its bigger-than-your-head burritos. With cleverly named menu items such as the Homewrecker (a loaded burrito) and Ruprict (a basket of tortilla chips smothered in cheese), Moe's will make you feel at home as its employees greet you with a hearty "Welcome to Moe's!" upon your entrance. The place also serves a variety of beers to wash down their delectable tacos. Located at 10660 NW 19th St. in Doral, Moe's offers a ten percent student discount so make sure to show the cashier your PantherCard.



Top's China Buffet:
This all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant boasts a lot of food, but none of it is very good. The restaurant's main appeal is the pricing. For about $10, you can dine on assortments of noodles, meats, appetizers and desserts. Although its name can be deceiving, Top's China Buffet does not only offer typically Americanized Chinese food, but also ho-hum items such as pizza. If you're a quantity-over-quality kind of eater, then this place is definitely for you. However, if your eyes are bigger than your stomach, be careful because you might get yelled at by an employee for wasting food.



Latin American Café:
Reasonably priced Latin dishes are the staple of this unassuming restaurant. The waiters are not usually thrilled to see people in our age group coming in, especially if it's a large group. However, it is a great place to pick up a cortadito and pastelito for under $2. Because the restaurant is located at the SW 24 Street and 107 Avenue. intersection, students can drive there, purchase a cheap meal of arroz con pollo, and return to campus in time for their next class. However, parking can be a nightmare during the day, and law enforcement officers frequent this restaurant so make sure you don't park illegally.



Smoothie Time:
Is perfect for someone who wants something fruity, refreshing, and full of vitamins all in one delicious drink. Smoothie Time has an array of smoothies to appease one's sugar cravings; however, paying $5 for a smoothie can be steep when you can buy a meal for that price somewhere else. Also, there's only so much enjoyment you can get when you've tasted the same thing for 15 minutes, not to mention have brain freeze. Conveniently located in the shopping plaza across from FIU's SW 16th Street exit, Smoothie Time is within walking distance of Gold's Gym so you can indulge accordingly.

Headline: Culinary alternatives available around Biscayne area
Author: David Rodriquez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For Biscayne Bay students, it frequently seems like there are no alternatives when it comes to going to new places and trying a different kind of meal. 

"I just go to a Burger King or McDonalds if I'm very hungry," said Senior Albert Burn, "[but] if people are interested on eating healthy they can go to [places like] Olive Garden." 

Today's demanding schedules and financial restraints rarely allow for experimentation beyond what word-of-mouth suggests. 

However, by exploring the choices that exist around the BBC, much culinary diversity can be found in a rather small radius. 

From ice cream to on-the-go tacos and Japanese-Thai cuisine, eateries along Biscayne Boulevard present choices that not only adjust to anyone's budget but also cater to sophisticated palates.

For the first meal of the day. most restuarants offer similar menus. 

Big Apple Deli features items such as salami and eggs, smoked sausage and eggs and a wide assortment of omelettes including cheese, spinach, vegetable, and Western varieties with most dishes priced within the $5.95 to $6.95 range. 

The position of the restaurant and the old eatery style of the establishment evokes a homeliness lacking in bigger places. 

 Pasha's introduces plenty of choices regarding omelets, spreads and pastries as well as fruit and granola to complement the meal. A well-rounded breakfast ranges from $12 to $15.

For something lighter, Paul bakery cafe offers complete breakfasts on-the-go like Express, Parisian, and Continental, all consisting of a cup of coffee/tea and a piece of pastry and that range from $2.95 to $6.95. 

With most of their products on display in their store and its own air of traditional bakery, a meal here becomes a most cozy affair.

When lunchtime arrives, Pasha's delivers the goods as well. 

Their menu features its own signature cuisine as well, serving varieties of mixed grill shish kebab along with specialty pizza baked in their own stone oven. An outing here comes at about $20-25. 

The menu at Sun City delivers with American, Philly, Havana, and Aventura crepes. 

Tuna, Boca, and Alaska wraps and Cuban, Jerk Chicken and Spicy Chicken sandwiches come with salads and side dishes with no item exceeding the $9.00 mark.

In addition, FIU students might see offers pitched at them during school year. 

"We also count with free wireless Internet for laptop users and, if you mention [this article], you will get 10% off your next purchase," said attendant George Pardillo.

For evening meals, Oishi Thai's hybrid of Thai and Japanese food yield combinations of appetizers, dinners, and house specialties, with meals pricing at $25-30 per seat. 

You can order any kind of appetizer and soup at any time of the day, but specific dishes are served for lunch and dinner respectively. 

If all you want at the moment is a sweet bite, Dippin' Dots and Chez Michele squarely hit the spot. 

The former, with its variety of ice cream cones, sundaes, and smoothies priced from $ 2.80 up to $4.80, offers plenty to satiate that craving for a refreshing dessert in addition to monthly scheduled promotions. 

Chez Michele, with its selection of fruit and cream pies, among them Mango-Mango, Fraise, Chocolate vs. Caramel and Tiramisu priced at $4.50 a slice, offers the alternative of a more casual and complete snack.

All of these can be enjoyed in Chez Michele's quiet environment either reading magazines or viewing paintings from local artists.

Biscayne boulevard in North Miami provides students with enough variety so, if you do not find exactly what you were looking for, at least you can try something new. 

"I prefer homemade to microwave or even restaurant food," said Freshman Elindra Porter. "But there are times you have to simply branch out."

Headline: New neighboring school seeks ties with BBC
Author: Fallan M. Thompson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After months of construction and traffic delays, the new school near the entrance of Biscayne Bay campus next Biscayne Landings dubbed David Lawrence Jr., opened Aug. 14. 

The Kindergarten through eighth grade school is a marine science theme school with a dolphin mascot and the motto: riding the wave of excellence.

"The theme is perfect because [we] are next to FIU. This [area] used to be mangroves and we live in South Florida," Blanca Correa-Cespedes, assistant principal, said. "We could have limited it to technology, math and science, but why do that?"

The school began correspondence with former vice-provost Raul Moncarz to establish an educational part before he left to establish an educational partnership with FIU. The school hopes to use FIU's resources to fuel its theme but is willing to offer something in return to the university.

"We'd like to use [FIU's] library, biology resources, and marine science building but student teachers could [do their internships] at our school," Correa-Cespedes said. "It would be dual benefit  for both parties."

Since Moncarz's departure, the school is in need of a contact person at FIU, as well as a representative from each departmentthey are interested in.

For example, the physical education teacher wants access to the track and pool. The school also wants to establish contact with Hospitality Management to further the school's Healthy Eating/ Healthy Choice Grant. 

"A clear and strong relationship with Hospitality Management would be helpful because they could come and educate teachers on healthy eating; to take it beyond the salad bar for the kids."

David Lawrence already has a working relationship with Johnson and Wales University.

Construction is continuing at the school. There is currently no parking on campus and teachers and parents are using the FIU stadium as their parking lot. 

Full completion of the school should be November 2006, according to Principal Bernard Osborn. 

"It was shared to me by the contractor," Osborn said. "But since it's construction, we're taking it with a grain of salt."

Concerns about traffic will not be made aware of until FIU's Fall semester begins Aug. 28. Public Safety's Captain Michael Wright is working with Osborn and North Miami Police on any traffic issues.

"It is certainly expected [to have traffic delays] and expect to have more traffic on the first couple days of school," Wright said. "I recommend coming to school a little early the first week."

Headline: Welcome week offers students play time
Author: Eddith Sevilla / Asst. BBC Director
&nbsp;
From a rock band performance to a Segway obstacle course, Biscayne Bay Campus will be hosting its annual Welcome Week from Aug. 25 to Sept. 1 with a series of events for all the new and returning students.

"We want all students to feel welcomed and to be introduced to all the different things this campus has to offer," said Elizabeth Cervantes, public relations director for the Student Government Association at BBC.

Various events will be scheduled throughout welcome week beginning with the Soak N Wet Flicks event that will take place on Aug. 25 at 7 p.m.

"This event is sponsored by SPC and they will be playing the movie "Benchwarmers" on a projector screen out by the pool," said Cervantes.

On Aug. 28 and 29, students will notice an Ask Me table in Academic One and in the library with an SGA staff ready to answer any questions students might have. 

"This is an appropriate way for us to show that we care and service students as best as possible," said Edgar Izaguirre, elections commissioner for SGA.

According to Cervantes, answers to questions such as "Where is the financial aid office?" or "Where can I buy bus tickets?" can be found at these tables.

Information booths are not all these two days will offer students. A free Segway obstacle course will be held on the evening of Aug. 28 in Panther Square to teach students how to ride a Segway and provide them with safety tips. 

Welcome Week will also include Got Questions?, an event aimed at demonstrating the different departments and organizations BBC has to offer, on Aug. 30 from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. in Panther Square. Present at the event will be Career Services, the Women's Center, University Technological Services and InterVarsity Christian Club to name a few services and organizations.

According to Cervantes, free pizza and soda will be offered at Got Questions?, along with some treats from the school's cafeteria and from several vendors from around the area.

A presentation by local band, Another Day in December, will follow the Got Questions? event at 4:30 p.m. in Panther Square.

"This is a pretty good band," said Izaguirre. "They've been playing all over the state and will be sponsored by Rock House Blend, "a commuter coffee house similar to Starbucks except with free food and a band making its debut on that day at BBC." 

The events scheduled for Aug. 31 will culminate with Trail of the Torch, a ceremony created to promote FIU spirit among students.  However, this ceremony will take place at 7 p.m. in the Housing Quad at University Park.  Transportation buses are scheduled to depart from BBC at 6 p.m. and head to UP.

With so much planning, the organizers of these events say they've stayed focused on the interest of each student.

"We're all a family here at  Campus Life and Orientation. Our main concern is the students and we are hoping that the students at BBC get the most out of the different events throughout Welcome Week," Cervantes said. 

"Welcome Week is truly aimed at welcoming the students to BBC and to have them also become involved because it can't be all work and no play."

Headline: Campus construction slowly forges ahead
Subheadline: BBC projects expected to run into next year
Author: Fallan M. Thompson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Several construction and remodeling projects are in full swing, as others are gearing up to begin the Biscayne Bay campus' beautification process. 

The Wolfe University Center is expanding to include a new cafeteria and fitness center. The $4 million project will offer state-of-the-art equipment and facilities.

"It is part of a long term approach to improving the campus," Carlos Aspillaga, the project manager, said. "Even though [the new buildings] are attached to the existing building, we will not lose usage of the existing building."

At 10 thousand sq. ft. the new cafeteria will match the current ones with a capacity of 235 people.   

"The [current] cafeteria is the original one for this campus and we thought it might be better for students and faculty that the dining facilities are on the first floor," the senior director said. "The building has a unique shape and is not modeled at all after University Park."

The risk insurance for this construction project was also renewed for the WolfeCenter cafeteria; it was going to be null and void by Dec. 1. 

Olson mentioned in a later update that they would continue using Aramark's services to provide food and facilities to the students at BBC. 

It should be substantially completed by March 2007, according to the contract manager at Stobbs Brothers. 

The new fitness center will be 10,000 sq. ft. as well and boast full locker facilities for men and women and a 1200 sq. ft. aerobic/dance studio. The current fitness center is only 3,000 sq. ft. and doesn't have a studio or offices for staff. 

"95 percent of the equipment will be new because of the raise in [the health and athletic fees]," Olson said. "The old equipment will be surplus and inventoried."

According to Olson, the current fitness center was used mostly as a student lounge

Discussions are underway about what to do with the old cafeteria space on the second floor. Olson said it may be used for classrooms or converted into a student lounge. 

There are also talks that the current fitness center space might become the new Health and Wellness Center, which is currently housed in a trailer next to the library. 

The project is almost two years behind, according to Olson, and began construction in late 2004. The projects are expected to be completed by May 2007. 

Another major project  on campus is the remodeling of all four chemistry labs in Academic Two. The air conditioning will be changed, old plumbing removed, current lab tables refinished and new table utilities will be installed. Painting will also occur.

The project is estimated at $1 million and the construction will not affect students or scheduling of chemistry classes.

"The construction will be done in phases." Filimon said. "The design is complete and construction bidding [began Aug. 18]. The bid process takes a couple of months so we might not be able to do it until Christmas break."

According to Filimon, the entire roof of the Hospitality Management building is going to be replaced in an estimated $600,000 to $800,000 project. 

"The building will not be closed," Filimon said. "Part of the reason [of the replacement] is it's old and partially because of [hurricane] Wilma."

The WUC is also expected to be getting a new roof. 

"It's just in the design phase so I am not sure about money," Filimon said. "There aren't any major problems now but we anticipate having problems in a couple of years."

Filimon also mentioned several minor projects going on around campus in various buildings, such as painting and replacing carpets and doors. These small projects cost between $1,000 and $50,000 and usually don't interfere with normal classes, he said. 

Next year's projects include remodeling the bathrooms in all the buildings and painting the outside of the buildings. 

"We must maintain a level of attractiveness," Filimon said.

Headline: New football teams pressured to play big programs sooner
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
A popular motto in sports is, "in order to be the best, you have to beat the best." Now, there's nothing wrong with that philosophy, but how a team accomplishes it can set them in the wrong direction.

The FIU football team is obviously following that philosophy - with the likes of the University of Miami, Maryland and Alabama on its 2006 schedule. But in its fifth year of existence, are the Golden Panthers ready to be thrown into the fray already?

Playing a tough schedule has its upsides - especially for recruiting.

Big-name opponents are also helpful in putting butts in the seats - something FIU is in dire need of. Fans want to see their school play popular teams, even if it means a guaranteed shellacking.

For example, back when UM was in its down years, the games against Florida State and Virginia Tech would always sellout, even though it was almost a foregone conclusion that UM would lose. 

You would think that watching your team get pummeled would turn off fans, but it surprisingly doesn't for two reasons: fans get to watch one of the best teams in the nation in person and there's always the hope of an upset.

But a tough schedule can also be detrimental to a young program's development.

Schools like Florida Atlantic, Vanderbilt, East Carolina and Central Florida began on the same path FIU is taking. Each program has played tough schedules every year and each has remained in the proverbial football cellar for much of their existence.

Losing gets old fast and the prospect of playing big schools can only work for so long. It comes to a point when a recruit will not go to a school that plays tackle dummy to the UM's of the world.

However, in today's victory-hungry world of collegiate football, the old way of playing a cup-cake schedule for a few years - building up players' confidence and easing them into a tougher schedule - would take way too long and would require a lot of patience from students and alumni. 

When that patience runs out, support (i.e. money) will run out as well.

So maybe the football program is rushing into playing tougher opponents (after all, they haven't had a winning season), but it has no choice. Like the old saying goes, money makes the world go round. 

And college football is definitely no exception.

Headline: Tougher schedule benefitial for recruiting, growth of program
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Golden Panthers coach Don Strock promised his team that they would play against the best of the best. And he kept his promise.

"The schedule doesn't get any softer," Strock said.

It certainly doesn't.

Besides playing in the competitive Sun-Belt Conference, the Golden Panthers are set for an up-hill battle against some formidable nonconference opponents.

FIU is set to take on cross-town rival university of Miami, which is ranked No. 12 in the Associated Press preseason college football poll, at the Orange Bowl on Oct. 14,.

Equally challenging are the Alabama Crimson Tide, last year's Cotton Bowl victors who finished No. 8 in the country, who will play the Golden Panthers Oct. 28 at Bryant-Denny Stadium. 

Other out of conference teams FIU will face are South Florida (Sept. 9), Bowling Green (Sept. 16) and Maryland (Sept. 23).

But players are salivating at the opportunity to play against the best and show their talents off on a national stage.

"If you're a fan, this is what you want to see," said junior guard Mike Alvarez. "It's a challenge, not only as individuals, but as a team. It's something we're looking forward to.  You don't know how good you are till you play the best. Now we have the opportunity to match up against the big boys across the nation. We feel we can compete with the Alabama's, Miami's and Maryland's, but we have to show the nation that."

Senior all-conference linebacker Keyonvis Bouie and defensive end Antwan Barnes will have a chance to show the nation they're considered the best at their positions in the Sun-Belt.

Bouie and Barnes, Lombardi Award candidates, had UM head coach Larry Coker visit their high schools to look at other recruits, but neither had the coach look in their direction. It is safe to say both players will be playing with a chip on their shoulders that day to show what coach Coker missed out on.

Besides giving the players an opportunity to play on the ultimate stage against top-tier opponents, the tough nonconference schedule is also part of a strategic plan to help the program grow.

As reported by The Miami Herald, FIU Athletic Director Rick Mello said that the University will receive a total of $800,000 for its nonconference games this season.

The tougher schedule can also be used as a recruiting tool. When the program first began, coaches would only recruit players out of Dade, Broward and Palm Beach county. Coaches are hoping that the added exposure will help bring in some recruits from different parts of the state and nationwide. 

"Everybody would like to go to [UM], but they can't because they're just not enough scholarships. So now with the schedule we have, we can play against those types of teams and find out how good they really are," said assistant head coach Bruce Hardy.

Headline: New offensive line looks to duplicate last year's success
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
What was a strength for the football team last year has turned into one of the biggest question marks heading into the season. Last year's offensive line helped the Golden Panthers lead the Sun-Belt Conference in passing yards per game and allowed second-team All-Sun Belt  quarterback Josh Padrick finish the year second in passing efficiency (122.6). 

The Golden Panthers offensive line will have a new look to it when they open the season Aug. 31 against Middle Tennessee. 

The only returning starter to the unit will be sophomore center Xavier Shannon, whom offensive line coach Leon Searcy is looking to lead the young line. Along with him at center, juniors Mike Alvarez and Jeffery Eugene will hold down the guard positions, while freshman Andy Levine and sophomore Dustin Gibson man the tackle positions.

"This is [Shannon's] unit. I put all the responsibilities on him and he's embraced it," Searcy said.

Shannon had the opportunity to learn from last year's former first-team All-Sun Belt center Victor Cernius, who started all four years at center for the Golden Panthers.

"He taught me pretty much everything about the game," Shannon said. "He always taught me to keep my head up because the defense will make plays, but you just have to make more plays than the defense."

Searcy added: "Victor was a student of the game.  There would be times when Victor would beat me in here watching film.  And he kind of passed that on to Xavier. Xavier's a very, very smart kid."  

Shannon, Alvarez, and Gibson are the only members on this year's offensive line who saw any playing time last year. In total, they all have 17 starts between them. 

In order to combat youth and inexperience, coach Searcy has emphasized nothing but perfection. Searcy isn't expecting his offensive line to come out and maul every defensive line. What he does expect is for his line to out-tough and out-execute their opponents on game day. 

"You got to have commodity on offensive line. You're not individuals, you play as a unit.  You either live by the sword or die by the sword, you either all look bad or all look good," Searcy said.

This year's tough schedule won't ease the process either. With tough opponents like Alabama, UM, and Maryland early on, growing pains will be expected. In the long run, though, the tough competition may help them later on when conference play intensifies during the later part of the season.

"The only thing that may help us as far as the long road is getting accustomed to the speed.  When they play Miami or Maryland, it's going to be full throttle," Searcy said. "I think it's going to be good for our guys to understand how they got to play. Playing a team like Miami, Maryland, Alabama, they're going to understand where they need to be as a team when it comes to speed."

Although many would worry that this year's offensive line will be dominated by an opposing team's front seven, many of the players prefer to let others do the worrying for them.

"It's something we're looking forward to. You don't know how good you are till you play the best," Alvarez said. "Now we have the opportunity to match up against the big boys across the nation. We feel we can compete with the Alabama's, Miami's and Maryland's but we have to show the nation that."

Headline: Fifth season brings high expectations for football
Author: Jaime Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For students, faculty and everyone else who has watched the FIU football program, it has been like raising a child, from its birth five years ago to its current first steps. 

However, expectations of winning are one thing that the community has never been too worried about, because there were things that had to naturally come first, such as getting into Division 1-A and finding a conference. 

"We have been losing a lot since I can remember, but it's all part of the growing process so it is not something that really frustrates me in particular," said senior Roberto Garcia.

The Golden Panthers are now entering uncharted territory in their fifth season of existence overall - second in Division I-A - and for the first time ever losing will not be disregarded as there are greater expectations for this team, experts say.  

ESPN.com legendary senior writer Beano Cook feels like Don Stock's team has to make a good run at the Sun Belt Conference Title this year. 

"It has been a nice and cozy time for FIU to get into its comfort zone, but with a weak Sun Belt conference, strong recruiting and a lot of acquired experience, I believe [FIU] should be competing in the New Orleans Bowl at the end," Cook said. 

The New Orleans Bowl, which will be played in the Louisiana Superdome Dec. 22, pins the Sun Belt champion against the Conference USA champion.

ESPN's college football analyst Pat Forde thinks that although expectations are and should be high, people shouldn't expect a Sun Belt championship just yet.

"There is definitely pressure to win more games for [FIU] and they should be ready to contend in the higher arc of the conference standings," Forde says. "I wouldn't go as far as saying they are conference favorites but, yes, there is pressure to perform better."

Last year's team yielded an overall record of 5-6 and 3-4 in conference play with the Golden Panthers being competitive in three of those four losses. 

In 2005, three teams shared the Sun Belt Conference crown - Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana-Monroe and Arkansas State, who represented the league in the New Orleans Bowl. 

This parity helps the bigger expectations for the Golden Panthers, said Sun Belt Conference Commissioner Wright Waters. 

"Our league is one of the most competitively balanced in the country," said Waters. "And with the Golden Panthers raising their level of play every year, contending for the conference title should be a goal for FIU and its coaching staff."

Do the students think this is the year the Golden Panthers have to make the leap? It depends on who you ask.

Some students, like sophomore Sofia Gomez, believe that FIU still has "some growing up to do as a team." While others, like senior Rafael Pardo, believe that losing is getting old. 

"I have been here since the beginning and at first winning wasn't a priority," Pardo said. "But it is getting a little old and if the school wants full support from the students, it is time we start winning big."

Subheadline: University should curb enrollment
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
This semester's official enrollment numbers aren't in yet, but if previous years' figures are any indication, they are bound to be sky-high. Last fall, 37,424 students were enrolled, up by nearly 2,400 students from the head count in 2004, which in turn was up just shy of 1,200 students from the 2003 count of 33,864 enrolled. 

These figures are not at all unusual for FIU - the number of students enrolled each Fall has been rising steadily by about 1,000 students per year. This amounts to an enrollment increase of roughly 15,000 students in the course of 15 years.

This is good news for South Florida: each additional number represented in these statistics stands for one more mind receiving a college education. Unfortunately, one more student seeking a degree at FIU also amounts to one more student scrambling for an increasingly elusive spot in any of the classes offered each semester by the University. 

Each registration period finds students resorting to the most desperate means in order to secure a place for themselves in the classes they need to take that semester. 

In order to not fall behind in the requirements of one's major, anything goes, from writing flurries of angry emails to administrators and walking into the office of one's program of studies and breaking into tears, to asking friends and classmates with early Panthersoft appointments to secure an extra spot.

That students must resort to work around the system, simply to secure a place for themselves in their required courses, only makes glaringly obvious what the administration should have already foreseen: the University is enrolling more students than it can properly accommodate.  

The amount of courses and sections the University can afford to open is closely related to the amount of professors it can hire. In turn, the amount of faculty members the University can afford depends on the amount of funding it receives.

Only last year,  the administration cited a $13 million cut in state funding to account for class cancellations, diminished course offerings and larger student-to-teacher ratios. 

One question follows naturally from all this.

If FIU, whether due to lack of funding or any other reason, is unable to open enough seats in order to properly accommodate the existing student body, why is it accepting ever-growing numbers of new students to enroll?

There is no virtue in the University educating a larger number of students, if it's is at the expense of the quality of the very education it is providing.

A better education for many is preferable to a sub-par education for more. Until it can get the basics down right, the administration should consider capping the amount of students it accepts each year.

Headline: Resident Life has plenty of advantages
Author: Pedro Ross / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
I have the windows open and my shoes off with my naked toes dangling up in the air, and I'm thoroughly enjoying the breeze that's coming through. I'm being very irresponsible because my air conditioner is on while the windows are open. This is one of the odd habits you pick up while living on campus. I'm usually very responsible when it comes to energy conservation, but not today, because I'm recovery from finals and I need to let my tensions out. I could never have this convenience living off campus; my FPL bill would be off the scale. 

So living on campus has certain advantages, especially the consolidation of bills: everything is consolidated by the school so you don't have to worry about receiving a monthly bill for energy, cable, DSL, etc.

I've been living on campus for about two years, which is longer than what I planned. When I came down to Miami, I was planning to either stay with one of my aunts or get an apartment in the general vicinity of the school. I didn't want to stay on campus, being older then the typical, reasonably fresh from high school college student. I stayed on campus my first semester, though, and I haven't left yet. 

The expenses here are slightly high; I pay a little over $700 a month to stay in my on-campus studio apartment. With the apartment, though, I didn't have to pay a security deposit or an additional first or last month's rent to get into the apartment. I just pay paid a $100 processing fee. What's more, when you eventually leave an apartment, it's also nearly impossible to get that security deposit back. 

I've lived in the real world for a few years and I know what you're thinking: If I live off-campus, I'll get a few friends to help out with the expenses. Wrong. Even friends you can trust with your life have the bad habit of leaving you in the cold when it comes to bills. You'll spend most of your time dwelling on whether your roommate is going pay their $200 share for utilities, instead of thinking about your homework or your social life. On campus, you could minimize your expenses by sharing a space on campus with somebody, you won't have to worry about mounting bills and it will save around $1000 a semester.

There are other conveniences. I like to get up in the morning and walk to the gym and then stroll back to the apartment. Then I bathe, and I'm ready for whatever. It only takes five minutes to go to class, the library, to one of your labs or to anything else on campus, and the supermarket is just across the street.

The price of gas is going up and traffic sucks. If you live 20 minutes from the campus, you're still going to waste an average of 2 ½ hours a week driving when you could be studying or doing something else.

I consider myself a private person, and when I study I become even more of an introvert. Even so, I do find myself participating in various clubs here on campus. 

All in all, with the cost savings and the time-based conveniences, together with available activities, living on campus gives students a sense of community that would be hard to come by off campus.

Headline: A room of one's own?
Subheadline: More freedom found in commuter's life
Author: Maria Chercoles / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Imagine it's your birthday and you want to invite some friends over. There is nothing wrong with that, right? Well, it is if you live in the dorms, where having more than two guests is against the rules. If I'm paying for an apartment, I want to be able to have as many guests as I wish. This is just one of the things that bothered me while living in the dorms. Now I can have as many people over as I can fit in my apartment, without RA's on duty ending my parties.

The relationships I made in the dorms have greatly enhanced my college experience. But after that, my advice is to get out on your own, unless you can live under their rules, which in my case, came close to driving me insane. Don't expect to get any special consideration; if you need a late check out, you'll be charged. Don't try to negotiate the bill, because you'll be forced to pay it anyway since they'll include it in your next semester's registration fee. 

However, I'm treated in a much more personal way. I developed a relationship with my landlord who treats me like a person and not a number, and there will always be room to negotiate special requests.

Not only is rent at the dorms much more expensive, but you are also being charged for many things you may not use. Your rent is used to fix acts of vandalism (drunk students love to break elevator lights or write their names on the walls), to pay for activities and social events for which you may not have the time nor interest to attend and to maintain a computer lab. 

A bad roommate match can be very stressful. Before living in the dorms, you are asked fill out a questionnaire about your lifestyle: what time you wake up, whether you like to study with music, how clean you like to have your room and whether you like having many people around inside the room. However, most students are living by themselves for the first time; they may be used to their home's routine, but don't expect them to follow it now that they are on their own. In the dorms, the walls between the rooms are so thin that you can hear my neighbor play his guitar in the afternoons. I felt I had no privacy.

Where I live now, the walls are made of concrete, so I don't have to know about anyone else's habits but my own. 

Nevertheless, I feel nostalgia when I think about the dorms. After all, it was there that I met most of my best friends. At the same time I'm  relieved I don't have to live under their rules anymore.

And in case you are wondering: yes, I do have to drive half an hour now to get to school every day, but considering all the advantages I have by living on my own, a half-hour drive is nothing.

Headline: Welcome Week starts new year
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Welcome Week, a series of events organized by the Orientation Committee to welcome new and returning students for the  academic year, began Aug. 25 and will continue until Sept. 4.

"This is the first time Welcome Week planning has been left to Orientation," said Orientation Coordinator Alin Wakefield. "It's also the first coordinated effort. Many organizations have their hand in this year's Welcome Week." 

A major event is planned for every day of the week.

"Mission: Impossible III," which was shown at the Housing Quad lawn Aug. 25, was the Student Programming Council Films committee's first movie this semester. 

Another SPC event this past weekend was the Liquid Pool Party by the Housing Quad's pool.

The party included three inflatable slides and a DJ.

"'Liquid' is a tradition for us," said SPC Vice President Micaela Ancewicz. 

After the party, students had the option to take a bus tour through Miami.

The weekend concluded with Freshman Orientation and Playfair, billed as "The biggest icebreaker you've ever seen" by the Orientation's website at orientation.fiu.edu/welcome.

Other events:

On Monday, Aug. 28, Orientation will be organizing Pantherpalooza, an event where students can meet representatives from various clubs and organizations.

The event will take place at the Housing Quad at 4:30 p.m.

After Pantherpalooza, the Caribbean Students Association will host a party in the GC Ballrooms at 7:00 p.m. 

"The Caribbean Students Association is known for their parties," said Wakefield. 

According to SPC president Bill Buchanan, the event expected to bring in the most amount of students is Disorientation, an SPC Comedy show featuring hypnotist performer Tom Deluca on Aug. 29

"Deluca is the biggest campus hypnotist in the [United States]," said Buchanan. 

"Arrive early because seats fill fast," said Richard Lopez, the SPC Comedy chairman. 

The Welcome Week BBQ on Aug. 30 is expected to be one of the highlights of the week-long events.

The  barbeque will take place in front of University President Modesto A. Maidique's house in UP with food and refreshments  served by faculty. 

"To my knowledge, there has never been a public student event held at the President's residency," said Wakefield. "It's going to be a great way for students to get to know the faculty." 

In addition to the BBQ, there will be tours of the President's house. 

The Trail of the Torch, a tradition begun in 2004 mimicking the Olympic ceremonies, will take place on Aug. 31.

Students can follow the torch as it travels across campus before lighting the main Torch of Knowledge in the housing quad at 7 p.m.

Finally, FIU's football team plays its first game of the season at Middle Tennessee, but students can watch the action in the Gold Parking Garage. The Panther X-Plosion starts at 8:30 pm; students can enjoy a DJ, food and prize giveaways.

Headline: Inaugural Panther Camp builds leadership and friendship
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
For freshman Philip Margetts, camping was about sitting around a campfire and telling old ghost tales -- until he experienced Panther Camp, that is.

One of his favorite activities: Pipes and Pieces.

"Group members had to piece different pipes together to get water from one end of a course to another," said Margetts. "Activities like that really emphasized teamwork." 

From Aug. 11-13, more than 20 incoming and current freshmen developed leadership skills and school spirit while dealing with intense heat and numerous insects as part of the University's Panther Camp.

Panther Camp, a $7,000 program introduced this year to mold potential student leaders, is the result of collaboration among five different FIU branches: the Student Alumni Association, the Center for Leadership and Service, the departments of Campus Life and Residential Life, and the Office of Orientation and Commuter Services.

Although this year marked the camp's debut, the idea of Panther Camp materialized several years ago in talks among FIU staff. 

"We've talked about the idea of a camp for three or four years now. Other schools do something similar for students, and we wanted to do something to get the new freshmen class excited," said Director of Campus Life and Orientation Charlie Andrews. "The different departments involved looked at existing budgets and collaborated, and Panther Camp finally happened."

To partake in the camp, freshmen either paid an $80 fee or received a scholarship covering camp expenses by writing a one-page essay about their reasons for attending. While many students signed up to make friends and get a feel for their university, others applied because of the excitement of a new experience. 

"I've never been camping, so the thought of a bunch of college kids camping in a remote area really interested me," said freshman Cedgar Caraveo.

Freshmen who attended the camp spent time participating in team-building activities and presentations at Gold Coast Christian Camp in Lake Worth, Florida. Before arriving at the camp, students were divided into 4 groups, each of which was led by two camp facilitators. 

"When picking facilitators, the five departments and areas involved with Panther Camp identified students they felt would offer a lot to the freshmen in terms of experience and leadership," said Andrews.

Throughout the weekend, the groups' facilitators directed students in learning about FIU's history and traditions as well as informing them of involvement opportunities at FIU.

During the daytime, the teams were assigned various tasks to complete. The tasks, ranging from skits promoting particular areas of FIU to games fostering teamwork, made lasting impressions on  freshmen like Margetts.

Other students, such as freshman Claudia Hernandez, felt more impacted by the presentations.

"Before attending Panther Camp, all I wanted to do was be a Peer Advisor," she said. "After the campus life presentation, the Student Government Association caught my attention because it's the umbrella organization that funds everything else."

The camp facilitators intend on keeping track of attendees' campus involvement to determine whether the camp proved successful in developing campus leaders.

"We have their contact information so we'll be keeping tabs on them," said Student Alumni Association Advisor Sean Kramer. "Although there isn't a particular plan to follow up on them, we will keep in contact with them either through future reunions or other means."

Despite the camp's effectiveness in creating a sense of initiative and bonding among its attendees, facilitators noted areas requiring improvement.

"A lot of the kids wanted more physical activities like an obstacle course," said facilitator Wolfgang Acevedo. "They also wanted more team-building activities included in the schedule."

Andrews agreed. 

"We might adjust the schedule by moving things around and adding or removing activities, but almost everything worked," he said. "Attendance is one thing we need to focus on, though."

Originally, 60 freshmen were expected to sign up for the camp. Instead, only 23 signed up. Even though the low attendance seemed discouraging, Andrews remained optimistic.

"I think the camp worked out better with a smaller group," he said. "It was a more intimate setting for students, and the facilitators learned a lot this year that can be implemented in the future."

According to SGC UP President Alfonso Leon, the camp's future is certain.

"There will be another Panther Camp."

Headline: Paid lobbyist fired for breaking Florida law
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
After FIU spent more than $500,000 of taxpayer's money on lobbyist Fausto Gomez, the University's Vice President of Administrations Marcos Perez found out it was illegal. 

"It's pretty complex," Perez said in an interview with The Beacon. "There are laws that allow you to pay full-time employees with state money and there are laws that allow you to pay with different buckets of money."

The contract, which began in 2001, between Gomez and FIU violates a 1974 law that forbids universities from using taxpayer's dollars to pay outside lobbyists. 

FIU spent $517,820.88 since 2000 on Gomez, according to school records.  Gomez's list of more than 30 clients included local schools Barry University and Carlos Albizu University.

Gomez's working title was "practitioner in residence," according to the 2001 letter that served as his contract. 

The contract stated that his responsibilities included guest lectures in political science and/or public administration courses, possible seminars and workshops for students, faculty or staff. 

His main job, though, was advising FIU's administration on dealing with state and local government issues and lobbying money for the University. 

"With the amount of clients he was representing he wasn't considered a full-time employee," Perez said. 

Perez said he noticed the "mistake" in July and drafted a letter to Gomez detailing the problem.

"In going through a review, I noticed a mistake and I immediately brought it to the attention of the general counsel [Christina Mendoza] and provost [Ronald Berkman]," Perez said. 

The draft is dated July 14, but was not sent out immediately.

Perez embarked on a three-week long vacation on July 26, twelve days after the letter was drafted.

"It was right before I was supposed to go on vacation," Perez said. "I wanted to make sure everything was correct."

The Miami Herald got a hold of the draft and published the story Aug. 5.  

Gomez's contracts were signed by former Provost Mark Rosenberg, according to a 2001 letter written by Rosenberg. 

This letter, addressed to Gomez, asked him, with the approval of University President Modesto A. Maidique, to "develop strategy and advise the University's administration on matters related to FIU's public affairs interests, with special attention to local and state decision-making."

In October 2005, Rosenberg left to be the chancellor of the state university system.

According to The Miami Herald, the state ethics commission could subject the school and the lobbyist to a two-year ban on lobbying the governor and the Legislature. 

Although this mistake could bring severe consequences to FIU, Perez doesn't feel it will hinder plans for the medical school, which was approved earlier this year.

"I don't believe it's going to have any impact [on the medical school]. We were the ones who reported it," Perez said. "If anything, it was the help from Mr. Gomez and his team that helped us get the medical school."

Perez said Gomez continues to lobby for the University, compensated with funds from the FIU Foundation. The University also plans to refund the state money used to pay Gomez.

"He's done a lot for FIU," Perez said. "We owe a lot to Mr. Gomez."

Gomez declined to comment, despite requests, and referred all questions to the University administration. Berkman and Maidique were unavailable for comment.

Headline: UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Subheadline: Law building, housing among new additions
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr./ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For several months now, construction workers have been steadily at work on one of FIU's latest projects: the College of Law. 

Matthew Downs, professor and director of the law library commented that construction for the college, which is located next to the Recreation Center, was only a few weeks behind schedule.

"The completion of the building is the final step in complete accreditation," said Downs. 

The FIU College of Law was given provisional accreditation in 2004. According to Professor Downs, there is going to be a dedication ceremony sometime in February and Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg will be in attendance.

The new building was designed and constructed by the architectural firm of Harper Aiken Donahue & Partners, Inc. in a joint venture with Robert A.M. Stern Architects, New York.  

A press release stated the estimated cost for the 151,368 sq ft building is $30 million.  

Nearly 50 percent of assignable space in the building will be reserved for the Law Library. The building will also include two complete courtrooms where students will be able to practice law hands on. 

In addition to the College of Law building, construction workers have been busy working on two other structures, the first being Lakeview Village, a new residential complex on the University Park Campus. 

Construction began on March 25, 2005 and the construction schedule was set at 488 days, according to Victor Citarella, the Associate Vice President of Facilities Management. However, with the excessive storm activity last year it looked like there would have had to be a construction delay. 

"The construction schedule would require an extra 30 days. Setting completion to about a month after student check in [to housing for the fall semester]," said Citarella. A delay of this nature would have caused a lot of problems for the Housing and Residential Life departments because they would have had to provide off campus housing and transportation. 

"Successful negotiations between FIU Facilities Management and Housing and Residential Life departments with the Construction Manager, Turner Construction, resulted in project acceleration at a cost of approximately $250,000," said Citarella.  As a result of the successful negotiations, the Lakeview Housing would open for residents to check-in during August. 

"The total project cost is $42 million, including architectural, engineering and inspection services, furniture, and equipment. The building construction cost  $37.4 million alone," said Citarella. 

The new building will house approximately 800 students and 25 residential life staff. The final major construction project is the new Frost Art Museum. The four-story, 46,000 sq. ft. structure will include nine galleries as well as space for a café, multipurpose room, and offices. 

"Special attention was given to the nine galleries that range from 900 to 1,600 sq. ft., five of which are indirectly lit from skylights." said Citarella. Furthermore the building was designed by the internationally known architect firm of Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum [HOK] according to Citarella. 

"The building has a unique shape. A high level of design was achieved by strategically emphasizing certain areas. As a focal point, in the lobby, HOK designed monumental stairs that are an engineering feat on their own and become the main sculptural elements within the four story glass entry atrium." said Citarella. "The $16.4 million project was funded by private donations and State matching funds." Construction on the project is expected to be completed in April or May of 2007. 

With two of the three major construction projects completed, what lies ahead is a mystery. Professor Downs rumors it may be a new building for the Medical School. But whatever the next project may be, it will only add to the growth of FIU.

Headline: Explicit Content...a sex and relationships column
Subheadline: College transition allows opportunity for new lusts
Author: Dana A. Gruber
&nbsp;
As the summer closes and the Fall semester begins, many of us must leave the bumping-and-grinding of the dance floor, put down those thirst-quenching mojito, and pick up our textbooks to focus on what really matters: getting an education. As depressing as that may seem, the party does not have to end here. 

For those of you who are college first-timers, you're not in high school anymore. There is no writing your crush's name on the bathroom walls or fear of a rumor spreading if someone discovers that you're a freak. Prepare yourselves for embarking on more adult-like relationships and be open to obtaining a more diverse group of friends. Also, keep in mind that dating in college is far different than it was when you were in high school (no curfew, independent living situations, and a much larger selection of mates, just to name a few examples).

 During the summertime, meeting someone outside of school is spontaneous and exciting, but making a back-to-school connection can be just as, if not more, invigorating. There is an abundance of great-looking, hormone-driven, and goal-oriented individuals here at FIU, including students of different ethnicities, ages, and sexual orientations. Whether you are straight, gay, or tri-sexual, FIU is the place to find whatever tickles your fancy.     

 A terrific way to meet interesting new people is to participate in a club or organization that you would enjoy being a part of. On the FIU webpage, under "Campus Life," there is a variety of on-campus activities listed pertaining to just about anything you can think of: student government, Honors Council, athletics, and fraternities/sororities. 

There are also many gathering places on campus where you can meet someone. One of my favorite places is the library. Just imagine the role-playing that could occur should the right person come along. Where are my naughty librarians? 

FIU also has many outdoor courtyards, where many people lie to catch some sun, while others prefer to sit in the shade and read a book. Or, if there is a cute guy or girl in class that piques your interest, do not hesitate to create stimulating conversation. Since you are taking the same class, perhaps there are common interests that can lead to the discovery of other similarities. Being study partners would be an excellent way to get to know them better. 

I started talking to this really cute guy in one of my classes during spring semester. We ended up sitting together every day, trading notes and flirtatious gestures. Come finals, we arranged to meet at his place for some study time. Let me tell you, intelligence is a major turn-on. After hitting the books for quite some time and taking a break for a snack, we had some crazy, glad-that's-out-of-the-way sex. There is nothing better to help clear your mind than that.

For those of you who are new to the game, here are some pointers to break the ice: you can start by smiling at the person and making eye contact. After class, casually approach the person and introduce yourself, make small talk and always ask to exchange numbers. Explain that you are new to the school and are looking to make friends with similar interests. If hooking up is what you have in mind, it will come along with getting to know the person better over time and possibly over a few dates. Who knows, by finals you might add anatomy to your studies.

Music - the perfect escape from the stresses of a new semester. Whether you are a freshman getting accustomed to what college life is or a super senior heading on your seventh year, many can agree that the best way to forget about your troubles is to turn on your iPod. 

An even better way is heading to a concert and actually seeing your favorite band live, and there's no better time to do that than this fall.


Bang Music Festival:
Picture this: It's 10 a.m. You're standing in line at Bicentennial Park, waiting for a full day of good friends, good booze and even better music. If you think this scenario sounds similar to Ultra Music Fest, you're right; except Bang brings together much better bands. The cool November breeze doesn't hurt either. 

The lineup includes such names as Daft Punk, Gnarls Barkley (not to be confused with the basketball player), Modest Mouse, Duran Duran (yes, I am shocked as well) and Kinky. Many more artists will be announced as they are added to the growing list. Presale tickets go on sale Aug. 26. Be warned, even though Bicentennial Park is a monstrous venue, it does get easily crowded. Don't be surprised if you find yourself standing in line for an hour, just for a cold hot dog and a $7 bottle of water.


Eighth Annual Caribbean Music Festival:
The Caribbean Music Festival is also being held at Bicentennial Park, and is said to be the largest Caribbean festival in North America. Formerly known as the Caribbean Reggae Fest, this festival will bring together a variety of local and national artists on Oct. 7, along with Caribbean-style foods and plenty of space for dancing. Tickets went on sale Aug. 25 and are $30 for general admission. The festival starts at 1 p.m., but it is suggested to be there an hour in advance.


Up Close and Personal Tour:
Did you know there was a difference between R&B artists Chris Brown and Ne-Yo? I sure as hell didn't. But, to prove the masses wrong, both have decided to tour together, headlining the Up Close and Personal Tour. Other artists scheduled to take part in this tour are Lil' Wayne, Dem Franchize Boyz and Juelz Santana. Presale tickets are sold out for this Sept. 7 performance at the American Airlines Arena, but regular tickets are starting at $30. Showtime is said to begin at 7:30 p.m.

Other acts scheduled for American Airlines arena are Shakira (Sept. 16-17, $17.50 - $85) and Eric Clapton (Oct. 23, $55 - $125).


The Strokes:
If you're a fan of those oh-so-lonely screaming and whining emo bands, then don't you dare go to this show. The Strokes may throw a beer bottle at you.

The group began their tour in Australia in early August and will be making their way to Pompano Beach's Club Cinema on Sept. 24 at 8 p.m. After the show, the band will head to Los Angeles where they will open for Tom Petty, for some reason. Tickets for Club Cinema went on sale Aug. 18, and are $30.

Another great act scheduled for Club Cinema is the Yeah Yeah Yeahs on Oct. 12 for $30. 


Nouvelle Vague:
You might not be a fan of cover bands, but there is nothing unoriginal about Nouvelle Vague. The band, comprised of 11 members, is known for taking some of the best '80s tracks and making them into their own. The music style is called "mento" music - mostly acoustic guitars, slow percussion beats, accordions and soft voices.

Nouvelle Vague will be finishing its North American tour on Sept. 23 at Downtown Miami's Studio A. The band will be performing songs from their first album, Nouvelle Vague I, along with tracks from their newly released album Bande a Part, which will be released just one day prior to their Studio A performance.

Songs in the album include covers of "Killing Moon" from Echo and the Bunnymen, "Ever Fallen in Love" from The Buzzcocks, "Don't Go" from Yazoo, "Dancing with Myself" from Billy Idol, "Heart of Glass" from Blondie and "Blue Monday" from New Order.

Nouvelle Vague is scheduled to take stage at 9 p.m. and tickets are $15 for general admission. 

Other acts scheduled for Studio A are Anna Nalick (Sept. 1, $15), Ladytron (Sept. 20, $20), We Are Scientists (Sept. 21, $13), Electric Six (Sept. 28, $12) and The French Kicks (Sept. 29, $10). All tickets for Studio A events can be purchased at www.studioamiami.com

Headline: Programming council promises innovative activities for fall
Subheadline: Hypnotists to Hispanic heritage events free for students
Author: Michael Hernandez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Programming Council has both new events and old favorites for the student body to attend during the Fall semester. Because of the organization's immense schedule of events, students shouldn't have problems finding something to do on a weeknight.

As a part of Welcome Week at University Park, SPC is bringing hypnotist Tom Deluca to campus. Expect to see your friends performing embarrassing antics like running around stage squawking like chickens. Taking place August 29 at 8 p.m., the show is being held in the Graham Center Ballrooms. Tickets are available in the Campus Life office (GC 2240) and the SPC office (GC 2304).

Micaela Ancewicz, vice president of SPC, feels events like these are important for students to feel included. 

"It's a great way for freshmen to feel at home, getting used to the campus with all these events planned," she said.

Every Friday and Saturday evenings this semester, popular films such as "Thank You For Smoking" and "The Da Vinci Code" will be screened. One film in particular, "Lady in The Water" (Oct. 27), will have the audience not jumping from their seats, but screaming in the pool as the movie will be shown at the Housing Quad pool.

But films are just one part of a much bigger scheme for the organization. 

If you need to burst out into song, Gracie's Grill is hosting a karaoke night from 7-10 pm the second Tuesday of every month starting on Sept. 12. If you want to showcase your vocal talents with a rendition of Justin Timberlake's "Move Your Body," this is the place to do so. Luckily, Gracie's Grill sells alcohol -- after a few beers, you won't feel too embarrassed about your mediocre singing.

Keeping in touch with the dominant culture at the university, the Hispanic Heritage celebration will take place from Oct. 9-19, with two events planned for each day. During this celebration, students will have the opportunity to represent their country and partake in Latin-themed happenings. 

The biggest event planned for Hispanic Heritage is Carnaval on Oct. 19.  It takes place between the Blue and Gold garages and will feature a performance from a surprise artist. 

"Our theme for Hispanic Heritage is 'Mi Orgullo,' and I think that it is important for all students, both new and old, to come out to the events and show the pride they have for their country and their heritage," said SPC Cultural Celebrations Chair Ayxa Barbel.

For the students who love to solve puzzles, SPC is hosting a murder mystery dinner on Oct. 30. This is a new fall event, where attendees would have to arrive in the GC Ballrooms dressed up to recreate an old Hollywood type of atmosphere. Authentic Italian food will be served to the patrons, and then the show will start -- the audience will have to solve a murder acted out by trained actors.

"This murder mystery dinner event is going to be one of the funnest, wackiest, and coolest events to come to FIU," said SPC Campus Entertainment Chair Ann Marie Muñoz. "Who wouldn't want to participate in a live game of Clue?"

On Nov. 11, the Insomnia tailgate party will take place after a football game scheduled for that day. It will include free food, activities and live band performances.

"The music acts are still in the works. It's too early to decide what bands will be performing for Insomnia," said SPC Concerts Chair Jackie Gadea.

SPC does not charge for its events. However, students pay for such entertainment through the Activity and Services fee included in students' semester fees.

"That money is invested for the students' benefit. Their own money is coming back to them," said Gadea.

Regardless, students such as junior Alfred Mekdeci take advantage of the various events SPC hosts every semester. 

"I think the events held by the SPC are great for students, especially for freshmen," said Mekdeci. "You meet other people and just hang out with other students. Plus it's all free, so it's a pretty cool deal."

Headline: Clubs council gives unknown groups a FIU audience
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
For many students, joining a club will help them meet new people and make a difference on campus. With hundreds of organizations at FIU, there is bound to be something that appeals to any student's interests.

But what if the underwater underwear-knitting club doesn't have a chapter at the University? 

If a particular club isn't present on campus, there's a simple solution: start it. The Student Organizations Council, the governing body for more than 140 clubs, gives FIU students the opportunity to create their own organization. 

According to SOC President Francys Crevier, any student can start a club, but there are certain restrictions.

"Any student can start a club regardless of what year or type of club they choose as long as it is a new type of club and not one that already exists in SOC or discriminates against race, gender, et cetera," she said.

The first step in forming a club is finding members. Without many members, it's unlikely that your Sudoku club will have much of an impact on the student body. Aside from lack of campus visibility, low membership can result in a harsher consequence: denial of club registration.

The SOC website states that "all organizations must have a minimum of 10 members beyond the executive officers of the organization." Aside from the 10 member minimum requirement, at least three executive officers and an advisor are needed.

"We encourage students to outreach to faculty and staff who would be interested in serving as an advisor," said SOC Advisor Andrea Gaspardino. "The advisor needs to be a faculty or staff member at FIU at University Park if the club is on UP or at Biscayne Bay Campus if the club is at BBC."

According to Gaspardino, the club advisors should attend meetings, meet with the executive board and attend events as well as help students continue to develop as leaders on campus.

After your club has met the membership and advisor requirements, the Organization Registration Package and Annual Officer Registration form should be printed from the SOC website, filled out, and submitted with the appropriate information to the SOC office in GC 2300 or the Campus Life office in GC 2240.

The next step determines a club's existence: approval.

"After the registration package located on the website is turned in, the executive board must review and then approve or deny registration," said Crevier.  

To determine whether or not a club is approved, the SOC executive officers vote. If the majority of the officers approve the organization, the club's president and advisor will receive notification. 

"A lot of factors determine whether we approve a club," said SOC Events Coordinator Anthony Munyaka. "It has to offer something that isn't offered by any of the other organizations."

However, a club's originality does not mean immediate approval.

"Even if a club offers something that the other organizations aren't offering, the club has to fill a need for the student body," added Munyaka. "If we see that a club is original yet not really filling a need, it probably won't fly."

Once a club is approved, members must attend an SOC orientation session, where they will be informed of all SOC guidelines such as club responsibilities and budgets. Orientation is scheduled for Sept. 21 and 22 in GC. Room location has yet to be announced. 

The following week, new clubs are invited to participate in the SOC club fair from Sept. 25-28.

"It's not necessary for new clubs to participate in the fair, but it is encouraged," said Munyaka. "It would be dumb not to do so because the fair is a great opportunity to promote and recruit new members."

Ultimately, starting a club through SOC can meet needs that otherwise aren't accommodated. While an underwater underwear-knitting club may be too ambitious, your idea for a club could make a profound impact on campus. The last day to register a new club is Sept. 1.
