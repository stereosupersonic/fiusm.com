Headline: The Diamond Girls: Team taking aim at top of conference
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
After the University of Louisiana-Lafayette was predicted in a preseason poll by coaches to win the 2007 Sun Belt Conference title, the women's softball team is looking to prove all the doubters wrong. Last season, the women's softball team got off to a rough start, but ended up finishing second in Sun Belt conference play. The Golden Panthers are looking for a different finish this season - on top.



Pitchers



Pitching will most likely be the Achilles heel of Golden Panthers. Last year's ace Sarah Belanger, who tossed 181.2 innings and recorded a 2.16 ERA, will be missed. Toeing the rubber for the Golden Panthers will be juniors Morgan Huling and Kerri Houck and sophomores Penny Eastman and Sandy Acevedo. Houck, who threw 85 innings last season with a 4.36 ERA, will be filling in the shoes Belanger as the team's ace. Eastman, who threw 117.1 innings with a 4.18 ERA last year, will follow Houck in the rotation.

"We've just got inexperience pitching and the only way that gets better is with experience," coach Kim Gwydir said. "The pitching will get better day in and day out, going out there."

Since conference play doesn't start until March 10, Gwydir will use a tough non-conference schedule to help develop Huling and Acevedo. Pitching the younger arms early will also give Houck and Eastman a break from tiring out their arms.

"I don't want to run them into the ground early. We're going to be using the bullpen early on," Gwydir said. "It'll keep them strong where were not over pitching them early in the early in the year. By spring, when we get to conference, they'll still have a lot of gas left in the tank and still be ready to go to pitch well in conference."



Catchers



Guarding home plate will be senior Preseason All-Sun Belt catcher Tabitha Embry. 

Last season, Embry had a team-high of eight home runs, which tied for second on the school's single-season list, drove in 37 RBI and maintained a .298 batting average. 

Though grateful for the award, Embry remain humbled and focused about the upcoming season.

"It's pretty good, but it's still preseason," she said. "I still have the regular season to prove myself."



Infield



The Golden Panthers defense will be the backbone of this year's team.

Though there will be new faces at shortstop, first and third base, the infield's defense has yet to miss a beat. 

Coach Gwydir is expecting big things from newcomer Monique White. The team's new shortstop made some spectacular plays while playing at Daytona Beach Community College. 

Gwydir also said that new first baseman Amanda Cox gives the team consistency at first. 

Completing the solid infield will be Desiree Fink, who has developed a special chemistry with White in practice.

"We've never had this solid of a defense before and our hitting can really do wonders," Embry said.

Playing third base, sophomore Katie Bell will be the only returning starter in the infield. 

"We have a completely new infield," Gwydir said. "They're extremely athletic. For our pitching staff, this will be a great asset."



Outfield



Like their infield, the outfield will be just as solid with senior Preseason All-Sun Belt center fielder Deomni Murray. 

Last season, Murray wowed fans and opponents with her ball-hawking defense. Murray will also be the catalyst of the offense, leading off the batting order. She also stole 24 bases while batting .286 last season.

Next to Murry will be junior Ashley Falk in left field and Kim Rodriguez in right field. 

Complimenting Murray's super woman defense is the perfectionist defense of Rodriguez, who had a perfect fielding percentage of 1.000 last season. 

Along with her stellar defense, Rodriguez drove in 21 runs last season while batting .263.

Falk only started in 23 of the 41 games she appeared in last season. 

In her limited playing time, she batted .200 while driving in nine runs.

 "Talent wise, we can go as far as we want to go," Murray said. 

"It's up to us how successful we are going to be this year. On any given day we can beat anybody."



Outlook



Although the FIU was chosen to finish third in the 2007 Sun Belt Conference Softball Preseason Coaches Poll, the Golden Panthers have a shot to win their conference as long as their pitching improves throughout the season.

They have the ability to manufacture runs at any point and outscore an opponent if needed.

With a strong infield and outfield, expect some spectacular plays throughout the season.

"It's going to be a tremendously solid team," Gwydir said. 

"We've got a deep team hitting. It's got everything from speed at the top, to consistent hitters, to kids who can hit the long ball. We've got the best outfield in the conference - easily."

Headline: GORE AND PEACE: Gore shouldn't get Nobel Prize
Author: Celine Pelofi / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Who knew that trying to get the world to recognize global warming could get you nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize? 

I sure did not, and I was utterly dumbfounded when I found out that former Vice President Al Gore was recently nominated by two Norwegian parliamentarians for just that.

The fact that someone could be voted for the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for such a thing is preposterous because global warming is a condition that can't be reversed. Just being aware of its presence does not change the fact that it exists and that it could be potentially harmful in the future.

Democrats have always been very environmentally conscious and Al Gore has always seemed to take that to the extreme. Just last year he created a documentary called An Inconvenient Truth on climate change, but does that make him worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize?  

Talking to the world about the weather and global warming does not bring peace to the world, or help further that motive; it only says, "Hey, watch out, the world is getting a little hotter!"

It is an award for peace, and if we look at our previous Nobel Prize winners we can see the standard that they have set for this award. 

In 1964, Martin Luther King Jr. won for his effort to bring racial harmony to American society. In 1999, John Hume and David Trimble won for their efforts to find a solution that would bring peace to Northern Ireland; Kim Dae Jung won the Prize in 2000 for working toward peace and reconciliation between North and South Korea. 

These three past recipients, out of over one hundred, have done great things to try to bring peace to our world. 

Al Gore has done nothing but make the world aware of an environmental issue. The United States Environmental Protection Agency gives out an Environmental Award each year and Al Gore would be a perfectly qualified candidate for it, not for the Nobel Peace Prize.

However, the Nobel Prize committee should consider any of its other 190 nominees who have made more of an impact on our world through peace and restoration. 

Other nominees such as Bono and Bob Geldof have made significant efforts to diminish poverty in developing nations and have dedicated much into doing so. They are much more qualified for the award and should be recognized.

The Washington Post, Fox News and numerous other periodicals and cable news stations claim that Al Gore has made a significant difference, and they could not be more wrong. Boerge Brende, a Conservative member of Norway's Parliament, told Reuters, "I think that climate change is this century's most important and most threatening environmental issue, and I think Al Gore has made a difference in putting climate changes on the global agenda."

What Brende does not realize is that we cannot change the weather. Humans do not necessarily cause global warming, and the Earth has undergone great changes in temperature before. However, there are many other things that we can advocate to improve the condition of the world. 

Some undoubtedly obvious examples would be trying to help the  unstable situation in the Middle East, or making the world more aware of each other's differences and increasing communication between our powerful leaders, and helping underdeveloped countries come out of poverty. These are all valid efforts that would be rightful qualifications for the Nobel Prize.

Al Gore has been nominated for an award that is supposed to recognize the effort to bring peace to our globe, and he has not accomplished that endeavor.  

The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Dec. 10 2007 in Oslo, Norway, and hopefully the person receiving it will be deserving of its prestige, honor and acknowledgment.

Headline: Editorial: Pan-African controversy unleashes racial tensions
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
By most accounts, race relations have come a long way in America since the height of the Civil Rights movement in the '50s and '60s. 

We may have left behind institutionalized segregation, but the more nuanced and implicit - and sometimes not so nuanced and implicit - attitudes and arguments that remain from centuries of racism are still painfully lodged in our social tissue.

More often than we'd like, those conflicts come back to haunt us. We still don't always know how to talk about - let alone deal with - the complicated issue of race.

This has recently become evident at FIU, in the conflict between the Student Programming Council and the Black Student Union surrounding the Pan-African Week's activities.

SPC has had trouble organizing events for the week that make every black student organization on campus feel like they've been properly represented. They've had trouble including these organizations, and most notably, the BSU, in planning those events.

The BSU feels excluded and misrepresented, and they've had problems expressing their discontent in a constructive way. They accused SPC of allocating a smaller budget for Pan-African Week than they had for other heritage weeks. This turned out to be false. 

According to an e-mail by Ayxa Barbel, the cultural celebrations chair for SPC, this year's budget for Pan-African Week will be $17,718, while the budget for Hispanic Heritage last fall was $16,794, nearly $1,000 less.

Now, they are engaging in a silent protest, in which BSU members show up at the week's events wearing black shirts that read "Not our history" in large white print.

Each faction's measures, rather than ameliorating the situation, have only further galvanized each side in their positions and have cast a negative shadow on a series of events that were supposed to be positive and inclusive.

The Beacon itself had trouble last week covering this situation properly. We tried to cover, not only Pan-African Week, but also the controversy surrounding it, and to relate each side's concerns accurately. Instead, the article we published drew criticism from both SPC and BSU, with each side claiming we had misrepresented them.

This only goes to prove that although the Civil Rights movement came and went, 50 years later we still don't know how to talk about race.

It doesn't help much that whatever terms and labels we use, whatever definitions we apply, they won't ever adequately describe the unique mix of race and culture that gives each of us our own ethnic identity.

Though each of us may be different, we all would like to be warmly included, accurately identified and fully accepted. This desire is valid, and we should all struggle to meet that ideal. But there will never be a perfect way to talk about, let alone handle, all our differences.

In the meantime, conflicts like this week's will surface time and again, and they will always be uncomfortable to deal with. Approaching these disagreements, and more importantly, talking about them, will allow us to continue facing our prejudices and misunderstandings.

The BSU is doing it by telling SPC, and other students, that they disagree with the programming for Pan-African Week. SPC is doing their part by trying to organize activities that - to their mind, and to the best of their abilities - include as many members of the FIU community as possible.

And The Beacon is doing it by trying to cover all of it the best we can.

As long as we all come to the discussion with some good will and a grain of salt, the outcome should be better than instead having said nothing at all.

Foul weather hits Florida and kills several endangered birds

All 18 young whooping cranes led south from Wisconsin last fall were killed in storms that hit Florida. The losses have dealt a devastating blow to the project coordinated by, Operation Migration, a nonprofit organization, to create a second migratory flock of the endangered birds in North American.

The cranes were being kept in an enclosure at the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge near Crystal River when the storms moved in and intensified on the night of Feb 1. Senior pilot and co-founder of Operation Migration Joe Duff said the birds were checked on late afternoon the day before and were fine.

Residents want independent commission to investigate levee failure

A group of residents are asking Congress to set up an independent, bipartisan panel similar to the Sept. 11 Commission to investigate why levees failed during Hurricane Katrina. Levees.org is also asked for a ''8/29'' commission Feb. 5, named for the date Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005.

However, the new Democratic leadership in Congress has been lukewarm on setting up an entirely new commission. Some congressmen are saying that investigations can be conducted through existing committees.

Headline: Political clubs make campus comeback
Author: Kelly Poveromo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students looking for a chance to immerse theamselves in the world of politics have the opportunity to do so with the College Republicans and the College Democrats. 

The Republicans are back for a third time and ready to get into the full swing of things again. They are led by Juanky Robaina, chairman, and Leonel Peraza, vice chairman. The CR aim to promote Republican ideologies, political awareness and activity, and partisan organization to those interested in joining. 

During non-election years membership dropped and the group's presence on campus phased out, according to Robaina and Peraza. But the duo believed they could revive it.

"We are doing what we have to do to become a legitimate club," Peraza said. According to Robaina and Peraza, in order to become an active club, they need to provide a constitution. They must also "set up an infrastructure to allow people to come in for a club that's already organized," Peraza said.

Since the election, Robaina and Peraza have been developing programs and activities to incorporate into the club such as monthly debates between the Republicans and Democrats on campus and charities to help out in the community.

"[Young adults] are in the demographics as the [lowest number] of votes per capita. We are trying to increase that number and get them involved in politics," Peraza said.

So far, the club has 12 members and has already participated in an election in which Robaina and Peraza won. Members meet on a bi-monthly basis with weekly board meetings.

Currently, Robaina and Peraza are using the website www.facebook.com as a method to gain members and reach their goal of 200 to 300 members. They hope to be considered an official club by Fall semester 2007.

On the other side of the political spectrum, the CD is still an active club.

However, they strive in gaining and keeping members during years between elections.

"For right now, I'm hoping to keep the club alive," said Mark Romero, chairman. "Students at FIU, even political science majors have little interest [in] politics. A lot of people do not have enough interest to remain in the club." 

Romero hopes to promote CD by hosting events such as voter registration, charities and also debates with republicans on campus.

"Hopefully the debates will foster interest," Romero said. 

Romero believes that both clubs must remain together. "If one [club] falls, the other one does as well." 

Another tactic for CD to gain popularity is by inviting future democrat presidential candidate, Barack Obama, to speak at FIU. By following necessary procedures, Romero claims it is quite easy to get politicians to speak at universities. 

"All you have to do is fill out paper work and send it into the senator's office. The senator will reply back to you within three weeks," Romero said.

This process is especially easy because it is free. Requesting politicians to speak benefits both the speaker who is campaigning and the audience learning about the speaker.

Romero is also trying to lead the democrats into participating in a charity involved in helping the victims of the Darfur genocide.

CD meets every Monday at 8 p.m. in the Graham Center, room 140.

Any students interested in joining the CD may contact Romero by email at Mrome014@fiu.edu.

Any students wishing to find out more information on the CR can contact Peraza at Leonel.Peraza@fiu.edu.

Headline: FIU artists exhibit work at museum
Author: Camila Martin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Over the past years, the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum has given students the opportunity to expose their art in the museum's walls, showing their artistic talents to other students and faculty members.

The 2007 Annual Student Art Show will take place Feb. 9 at 8 p.m., and will be presented by special guests such as Rosa Sugranez, a long time member of FIU's Board of Trustees, who will be presenting some of the awards to the best art pieces in 20 different categories.

Another guest at the event will be Alfonso "Alfie" Leon, Student Government Association president, who will be the Master of Ceremony. 

The art competition was open to all students, and works could be submitted in any medium, such as photography, ceramics, wood paint, graphite, audio/visual, acrylic and oil. 

For the first time, the "Best in the Show" award will be given this year.

Elizabeth Cerejido, the museum's curator, is part of the jury who will be selecting the winning art pieces. 

"Only 70 or so art works were chosen for the Annual Student Show from hundreds of submitted works, and only about 20 of them will actually receive awards," Cerejido said. 

Different issues and themes inspired students' artworks.

Mariela Rossel and Kacey Westall, both juniors majoring in fine arts, collaborated in a piece called Serial, Cereal that is going to be exposed at the museum during the show. The medium for their work was digital media.

"The inspiration for my piece was the serial killer Ed Gaines," Rossel said.

Cristina Molina, also a junior majoring in fine arts, used video as her medium for her work titled Foot Cooling and Gorgeous Legs.

"In the video I interview seven women. My inspiration was to see how issues of beauty and aging affect women at all ages," Molina said.

She plans to continue working on the piece after the exhibition and interview more women to enhance her work. Molina is also planning on submitting her work to other art contests.

After the opening ceremony, the exhibition of the student works will remain open until March 11, when the art pieces will be taken off and all works will be returned to the students who created them.

This year's show has many sponsors including Border's Framing; Artmoves, Inc; Nu Press, Books & Books, Inc;  Ray Stormont; David Blumenthal; and President Modesto A. Maidique, who also made a donation for the awards ceremony. 

The show will take place at The Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum, Feb. 9 at 8 p.m. 

Entrance is free and open to everyone.

Headline: PROTESTS CONTINUE: Students demonstrate during Pan-African Week
Author: Cristela Guerra / BBC Managing Editor 
&nbsp;
Students surrounded the Graham Center pit in black shirts Feb. 5. The group - 10 to 15 in all - stood in silent protest.

Demonstrators ranged in ages, background and majors. Solemnly, they stood together allowing their silence to speak for itself. Their T-shirts read in white letters: "Not my history."

This was the first demonstration by students representing various on-campus organizations in response the Student Programming Council's Pan-African Heritage Week, an annual event held in celebration of Pan-African culture.

This year, the events will last from Feb. 5 to Feb. 15 set to honor Black History Month.  The SPC committee in charge of planning the heritage week adopted the slogan "Umoja", an African term that in English means unity.

T-shirts, necklaces and banners were all stamped with the slogan, but the theme stood in stark contrast to the faces surrounding the pit in quiet vigil. The students congregated that way for over an hour, even while performer Djembes N Jazz played and read poetry.

 For many represented in this collective protest, the event was a far cry from the true meaning of umoja.

 "It's no disrespect against the artist, but we felt the way that Pan-African Week was organized, from beginning to end, from the brain-storming to what's going on now did not take us into consideration," said Lori Bellot, who is a member of various organizations, including the Black Student Union.

Bellot participated in the protest, which she says was "brought by a group and headed by a group" of students from a variety of organizations. They all support the idea that their interest were not represented.

Examples of this include everything from lack of access to the committee's budget, lack of communication and a neglect to implement opinions taken from non-SPC organizations.

Bellot also emphasized that they define Pan-African culture as not solely represented in its African roots, but the South American, Caribbean and other influences, something she felt was lacking in it's planning.

Nefertiti Alexander, another student that participated in the demonstrations, mentioned that frustrations were rooted in the lack of response from the committee chair to these complaints.

"They asked for budgets and event calendars, which we never received.  Then they were told the calendar couldn't change and a few weeks later the calendar was updated once again. It just seemed that they already knew what events they wanted and did not include us in its planning," Alexander said.

A variety of activities such as the Mr. and Ms. Pan-African pageant and a play were both cancelled after reservations were not met by the Graham Center.  The group also felt SPC did not consider its non-traditional students in arranging times, most activities held between 12 and 2 p.m. 

Ayxa Barbel, cultural heritage chair for SPC, sees the situation as not neglected interest but rather the result of logistics and technical difficulties.

In the past, SPC had assigned a separate person to take care of each heritage week including Hispanic, Pan-African and Asian, but this year, that wasn't the case.  Barbel was in charge of overseeing the background and final aspects, which she said began back in October for Pan-African week.

She also said that, though representatives from organizations such as the BSU and the Caribbean Students Association, among others, attended some of their meetings, she didn't hear of complaints until close to the end of January.

"There's red tape to go through in anything at FIU. We're students, we can't do whatever we want. I tried to listen to everyone and tried to work it out, even asking the group whether serving BBQ as a food would be offensive and they voted no."

Barbel's collective committee consisted of a group of 10 to 15 students and faculty, all of different backgrounds and ethnicities. She mentioned when she found out about events such as the pageant, she would update the calendar and find out how feasible they were.

"BSU came to me telling me they wanted to put on a play for Pan-African Week except they needed some co-funding. They presented me with the outline of costs and some things made sense and some didn't. I let them know that if they held it in the GC Pit they would save money on expenses such as microphones," Barbel said. 

"I even went with them to the offices to fill out the necessary forms, but there wasn't anything we could do when it was cancelled by the Graham Center."

Similar to the play were issues that arose with reservation conflicts with the GC ballrooms for the pageant, according to Barbel. 

"Some of them came to me the week after asking if they could, but by then it was too late," Barbel said. 

She insists she did the best she could to get back in touch with those who couldn't attend all meetings and even developed a Yahoo group to communicate with those who didn't come. According to Barbel, the problem was that those who attended the meetings didn't make their opinions known.

However, Bellot argues that more should and could have been done. 

"When they give excuses, it's because they did not look into it," Bellot said.

She also said she and other members were present at the meetings and did give their input, specifically regarding the coffee house and the pageants, but they could only do so much.

SPC interim president, Micaela Ancewicz, said there are resolutions on the horizon.

"It's now being discussed by Campus Life and they just don't want it to be an issue in the future. But we are working on a solution," Ancewicz said. "[Barbel] works day and night on this for many, many months, and what does she get as feedback? Complaints." 

Charlie Andrews, director of Campus Life, didn't see anything wrong with the student's protests.

"This is just based on people's perceptions of how things were planned. I have no problem with people protesting. They are welcome to express how they feel," Andrews said.

Headline: Local rap trio rhymes about life
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Just like one of the tracks on their self-titled debut album, local rap group Strong Hearts is looking to take over the Miami rap scene.

"We wanted to come out with something for the clubs and the streets ­- we talk about life and how you live it," Carlos Rojas, 20, also known as Lyrical, said. 

"We're just hard core rappers where we talk about life. We ain't about that bubble gum s--t. Ain't no 'lean with it, rock with it' for us, we come hard with it."

Lyrical, along with his cousin Rafiel Moreno, 19, a.k.a Baby Gaddi, and his friend Joey Merizalde, 26, who goes by the name Chosen, make up the rap trio.

Their 20-track album is loaded with joints such as their single "Warriors" that address more serious issues in addition to 'bump' at the club.

Though they remain unsigned, Strong Hearts has been hitting up clubs throughout Miami trying to promote their album.

"We're making a lot of moves, we're just trying to get out there," Lyrical said.

Frustrated by the cost of studio time, Chosen, Baby Gaddi and Lyrical produced most of the album at their own studio in Baby Gaddi's house.

"For six months, we sold CDs and hustled to build our own studio," Lyrical said. 

Three months after the construction of their studio, they were able to press 1,000 copies of their self-titled album Strong Hearts.

Although they said music is their first true love, it doesn't pay their bills -not yet, at least. All three attend Dadeland City College and hold jobs, leaving them to produce their songs late into the night. It was during sociology class where Chosen and Baby Gaddi first met.

Despite working into the wee hours of the morning, Strong Hearts found energy in each other.

"We motivated each other to produce this album," Chosen said. "Once we get together, it actually becomes easier to do it. We recorded 'Warriors' in one night."

Though few Hispanic rap artists are dominating the charts, Strong Hearts saw 305-native Pitbull's success and believed they could create their own path to stardom. Strong Hearts said they want their music to cater to everyone who loves hip-hop music.

"We represent for every f-----g culture there is," Lyrical said.

Strong Hearts will be performing live Feb. 9, midnight, at Club 609. To purchase their album or hear some of their songs, check them out at www.myspace.com/stronghearts4e.

Headline: Timeless Notes: Professor Performs Recovered Holocaust Piece
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The story begins with three families affected by the Holocaust: the families of Polish conductor-composer Paul Kletzki; American Symphony Orchestra Music Director Leon Botstein, whose grandfather was Kletzki's personal friend; and FIU professor and artist in residence Robert Davidovici, whose mother was in Auschwitz concentration camp. 

The American Symphony Orchestra will play Kletzki's "Violin Concerto, Op. 19" on Feb. 9 at 8 p.m. in New York's Lincoln Center. This is the first time the concerto will be performed after the piece was almost obliterated during World War II. 

Conducting it will be Leon Botstein and performing its solo will be none other than Davidovici. 

Kletzki was born in 1900 and composed his concerto in 1928. The Nazis placed a ban on Polish orchestras and compositions once they marched into Kletzki's homeland in 1939. They began systematically destroying musical pieces, and Kletzki grew desperate to salvage his life's work. After fleeing Poland, he buried two trunks full of his compositions - including his "Violin Concerto, Op. 19"- outside a hotel in Italy. The building was afterwards bombed and destroyed.

After the war ended, Kletzki continued his work as a world-renowned conductor. He never composed music again.

Years later, workmen in Italy found Kletzki's two trunks. They immediately shipped them to his home in Switzerland. Incredulous that his work could still be intact inside those trunks, Kletzki died without unlocking them. 

Davidovici was once professor and artist in residence at the University of Northern Texas, where he worked with Professor Timothy Jackson, who found and has been promoting Kletzki's violin concerto. Lynne Melocarro, executive director of the American Symphony Orchestra, explains how Davidovici and Jackson revealed Kletzki's newfound work to Botstein.

 "They received an enthusiastic response," Melocarro said, "since Dr. Botstein had been searching for a work to perform that was truly representative of Kletzki's greatness."

 Botstein was so eager to pay tribute to Kletzki's name and talent partly because he himself had observed the toll the war had taken on Kletzki's persona.

 "I had the privilege of meeting him," Botstein said on the American Symphony's website. "I recall even then an aspect of resignation, if not bitterness, which the history of his career makes all too understandable."

 Botstein also wrote that Kletzki's unspeakable losses caused him not only to never unlock the trunks but also to lay down his pen, turning from composing to only conducting.

 "The trauma of displacement and suppression and, ironically, the good fortune of survival … brought Kletzki to a comprehensible but compelling condition: that of silence," Botstein wrote. "It is my hope that this performance of his Violin Concerto will assist the overdue reexamination of Kletzki's achievement as a composer." 

The events of Feb. 9, then, will represent the crossing paths of three men with rich histories. As historically and personally significant as this evening will be, Davidovici holds the firm conviction that he must play each and every piece throughout his career with as much passion as he will play Kletzki's.

 "The piece I'm playing at that moment has to be my favorite so that what I'm  imparting to the people will be something that they take home," he said.

 Such a comment reveals part of Davidovici's philosophy of music, one that certainly had an early commencement, as he picked up his first violin at age six in his native Romania. He later attended and became a teaching assistant at The Juilliard School in New York. He has since performed with musicians such as Isaac Stern and Yo-Yo Ma, as well as received first prizes at the and the Carnegie Hall International American Music Violin competitions as well as in the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation Violin competition.

 Davidovici hopes to instill his love of music in his students.

 "I ask them to ask themselves why they are in music and I crystallize the reasons I am and I ask them to compare," he explained. "I am in it to give joy to the audience. To the extent that the audience can forget their daily troubles and enter the world of the composer, I am successful."

 Davidovici emphasized the importance of understanding and communicating Kletzki's original intentions. He spoke of the musician as a sort of intercessor, a translator between the composer and the audience.

 Students interested in hearing Davidovici's renditions can find his CD on  Amazon.com or in the Green Library

Headline: Catholic concert celebrates religious, racial diversity
Author: Carla St. Louis / Contributing Writer

Known as a day of praise and worship, the third annual Faith Fest Concert's goal is to demonstrate that a person's fellowship with God is not just limited to their house of worship. 

"The Faith Fest Concert is an opportunity to experience faith in different ways outside of the confinement of church. This event symbolizes a way to come commemorate with young people the knowledge of God all while enjoying themselves and celebrating their faith," said Wendy Bourgault, who is involved with the Catholic Campus Ministries organization at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

The concert is being sponsored by ministries from various South Florida college campuses in conjunction with BBC's Catholic Student Association

It has become a blowout celebration with a variety of multicultural aspects since it first came to fruition.

This year, it is being held at St. Thomas University from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m., Feb. 10. Tickets are $5 per person.

"It is beneficial since this event allows campuses to unite; like-minded individuals get to meet each other," said senior Edison Lozada.

Despite the event being sponsored by a Catholic organization, it welcomes students and individuals from all faiths and cultures.

"The Faith Fest Concert is about celebrating your universal fellowship with God-all religious faiths are welcomed," Bourgault said.

The concert will consist of performances by spiritual artists and guest speakers. These special guests were selected to represent the theme, "Go Make a Difference."

The concert's headliner is Steve Angrisano, a recording artist. Angrisano will also give a keynote speech about making a difference through simple actions.

Other performers include Tocando a tu Puerta, a Latino Christian band, and Biju, an Indian musician. 

Felipe Estevez, bishop of The Archdiocese of Miami, will give a trilingual mass in Creole, English and Spanish.

Senior Elizabeth Schwartz believes the Faith Fest Concert will make a positive impact on students and the South Florida community at large.

"[This event] is beneficial for FIU students because students are brought together in a family-oriented environment which enables them to re-establish and reinforce beliefs and morals," Schwartz said.
