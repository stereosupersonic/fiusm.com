Headline: Pan-African Celebration
Subheadline: SPC hosts cultural festivities at BBC
Author: Sheaon Reid/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
To commemorate Black History Month, the Student Programming Council on both campuses are hosting a Pan-African Celebration, a two-week long celebration of stimulating and informative programs to let students and faculty members alike know more about African heritage and culture, said Juniole Justilien, BBC Pan-African Chair. 

This year's festivities at BBC run until Feb. 13. Pan-Africanism is an idea that grew out of 19th century efforts to end slavery at the  time European powers began their colonization of Africa. 

As a result of these events, black people worldwide began to realize they faced common problems - slavery, colonization, and racism - and it would be in their best interest to work together in an effort to solve these problems.

Out of this realization came the Pan African Conferences of 1900 (London), 1919 (Paris), 1921 (London, Brussels, Paris), 1923 (London), 1927 (New York), and the last official one was in 1949.

Various colleges and universities have caught on to the Pan-African movement and each year, host various events in commemoration of the celebration.

Last week's Pan-African events included Ragtime Music and Swing dancers, an African jewelry workshop, a Dance Assemble, displays representing the African and Haitian culture and African food. 

To incorporate Haiti's bicentennial anniversary, the week's events also included  Haitian folklore dances performed by Ayizan Kreyol dancers and autograph signing by T-Vice, a popular Haitian group music. 

The week's events, which was to be concluded by an overtown photo museum exhibit, was postponed until the third week of February due to technical difficulties. 

Next week's events include The Soul of Louisiana, (a New Orleans themed event)  Also scheduled is a Rastafarian Lecture, a Tribute to Hip Hop and a Caribbean Blast-Off Party. 

Despite SPC's efforts at Biscayne Bay, the first week of the Pan-African celebration was not a total success. 

"I got what I wanted to accomplished in certain ways, but hoped there would have been more students participating in the events," Justilian said. 

Besides that, students were exposed to the African culture and got a taste of African food.

BBC students also wished things were different about the Pan-African celebration. 

"I appreciated the fact that FIU took the time to put on these events, exposing me to different cultures," said Tiffany Campbella, senior and hospitality management major. "But at the same time I wished I saw more students in the Wolfe University Center and most of the time the events started late."

Headline: Clark: Ignore race, help everyone
Author: Javier Novoa/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Three hundred people gathered in the GC Ballrooms on Feb. 3. to hear Joe Louis Clark speak. 

The Pan-African Society and the Student Government Association Lectures Committee invited Clark to speak as part of FIU's month-long celebration of Black History month. 

"A lot of people come to FIU. It's really important that they really see the focus of why they're here, and that education is a good thing, it does have a good future for them and that's why we thought he was an important person to bring tonight," said Raj Maharaj, chairman of the SGA Lectures Committee.  

Clark is an educator that has been featured in Time magazine  and twice on 60 minutes. 

During the Reagan administration Clark was a named a model educator and was offered a White House post as policy advisor, which he turned down. 

Clark resigned from Eastside High in 1990, but not before a movie was made in 1989 based on his achievements at Eastside called "Lean on Me."

 Clark's life has also led him to write a book called "Laying down the Law." 

His latest crusade is as director of Essex County Detention House, a juvenile detention center in his home town, Newark, N.J. 

"One hundred years from now it won't matter how much money you had, what type of cars you had driven, the number of degrees that you had, but 100 years from now, this world might be just a little bit better because you were helpful in the life of a kid. Life is just like an echo, what you send out that's exactly what you're going to get back," Clark said. 

Throughout various moments in his speech he named specific individuals in the audience he met earlier. 

"Kathy, you're not here by accident you are here for a specific purpose. You survived one out of nine million sperm to be here, you're a winner!"

Clark's belief in education and equality was a recurring theme through out the speech. "Help to lift up others, whether they look like you or not. I would never do for a black kid what I wouldn't do for a white kid or a brown kid. If I can't help them both equally, then I don't want to be involved in the process. I will never surrender my principles to race." 

He continued on to comment on cowardice by saying: "The worst type of cowardice is to know what is right and not do it."

About standing firm in your beliefs Clark said, "It takes no courage to get in the back of a crowd and throw a rock. I would rather go to Hell by choice than to go to Heaven following a crowd. Don't let anyone define you. Don't you dare let anyone set limits on you or tell you what to believe. Don't you dare become a ventriloquist dummy." 

In closing, Clark said "The race does not to go to the fast or the battle to the strong, but I declare to you the person who wins, ultimately, is the person who thinks he or she can. Doubt whomever else you will, but never, never, never doubt yourself. Don't quit!" 

After the speech, Clark stayed to sign autographs and take pictures with some of the assembled audience. After that a small reception was held in Clark's honor. 

When asked what his inspiration in life was, he said "What inspired me initially was my mother, who put the board of education on my posterior by making me have that fervent desire to be somebody, to be productive. My community inspired me, church inspired me, the Bible inspired me, most of all my teachers inspired me to be something of consequence in society and don't to make excuses for your lot in life." 

His importance to education was not lost on Vicki Owles, assistant director for Campus Life and SGA adviser, who said of Clark "I think that Mr. Clark is an inspiration in the field of education and I think that he has many lessons in life that he can share with these students that will help them to pursue their goals and the things they want to do in life." 

Former Eastside High School student, Solange Espinal said: "I'm very interested on a personal level, I know he's a great speaker...and he truly did change that high school a lot." 

Some students were amazed at his powerful message. 

"I thought it was very inspiring and I felt he was the most powerful speaker I've heard in a very long time," said Sarah Colby a graduate student majoring in biology. 

Some, like Errol Jones, a junior majoring in business management, looked at the positive aspects of his message.  

"It was a good speech and he talked about the good things that happen in real life."

Although Russell Farter, a senior majoring in history, put it best when he said, "It was very motivating and it's an inspiration for all FIU students that were present and heard his magnificent speech."

Headline: Morning after pill provokes debate
Author: Vanessa Gomez
&nbsp;
The debate over the possible over-the-counter availability for emergency contraception, also known as the "morning after pill" has brought controversy from religious and women's groups opposing the drug.

The  ECPs are actually a combination of two, three or four birth control pills taken once within three days of unprotected sex to prevent a pregnancy. 

The first dose must be taken within 72 hours after intercourse; a second close is taken 12 hours later.  The pills cause menstruation within two weeks, which flushes out the possibly fertilized egg. Doctors must prescribe the pills.

Federal Food and Drug Administration advisers recommended the morning after pill be available over the counter.  But the FDA, which usually follows its advisers' recommendations, may vow to pressure from religious and womens' groups, that worry about the drug's long term effects and moral implications

  "We are disturbed by lack of concern on the medical safety," said Wendy Wright, a spokesperson for Concerned Women for America, a conservative public policy group.

 ECPs work by releasing a high amount of estrogen and progesteron to a woman's system. These high dosages may disrupt the menstrual cycle and cause extremely uncomfortable side effects like severe stomach upset, nausea and vomiting.

Plan B and Preven, the two main ECP manufacturers, claim the pill is 95 percent effective.

 Junior and marketing major, Xenia Mendez says she is familiar with ECPs. "I don't think it's a good idea to make the pill accessible to everyone, people will abuse it without knowing if it's good for them or not." 

 According to Planned Parenthood,  the world's largest voluntary reproductive health care organization, approximately six million women become pregnant each year in the U.S. and more than half of those pregnancies are unintended. 

 Experts say widespread use of emergency contraception in the U.S. could prevent up to 1.5 million unintended pregnancies and 700,000 abortions each year. 

During a pilot project in Washington state, from March 1998 through June 1999, almost 12,000 ECP prescriptions were provided. The study found that ECP use prevented approximately 680 unwanted pregnancies, about half of which would have ended in abortion. 

 Many religious organizations oppose the drug, arguing pills are anoher form of abortion. 

The Vatican's Pontifical Academy for Life released a statement when Italy made ECP available-over-the counter in 2000. 

It read: "Since [ECPs] are becoming more widespread, we strongly urge everyone who works in the sector to make a firm objection of moral conscience... especially in view of the new hidden forms of aggression against the weakest and most defenseless individuals, as is the case with the human embryo."

 Health and Wellness nurse practitioner Kathy Kleinert said that there is a very high demand for this type of specialized care at FIU.  

"We see thousands of students for a variety of services, and at UP, we have about 400 visits per year that are for 'morning-after pills', Kleinert said.

 The Health and 

Welness Center, which is now being renovated, will open a seperate clinic devoted to women's health services.

Health and Wellness also offers oral contraceptives pills and injections, contraceptive patches and rings, diaphragms, cervical caps and male condoms.

 The center offers information and  referrals to community providers for contraceptive methods it does not offer.

 Thirty-one countries currently allow over-the-counter sales of the "morning-after" pill.

Headline: Homestead's Kendrick leads list of 26 football recruits headed to FIU
Author: Lou Stadler/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Twenty-six high school seniors have signed letters of intent and have pledged to become Golden Panthers this fall, said FIU football head coach Don Strock at a Feb. 4 press conference.
The second largest signing class in the program's four-year history was a great one, Strock said.
"This is probably the best pool of talent in Dade and Broward county since we've been here, since the football team's been in existence," he said.
All 26 are from Florida schools, including 14 from Miami-Dade and two from both Broward and Palm Beach counties. Strock and newly  appointed defensive coordinator Bernard Clark hope to see significant improvement in the speed of the defensive line.  
"No defense can have enough defensive linemen," Clark said.
Nine new linemen will be joining the defense this year, most notably Merritt Island's 6-foot-3-inch, 305-pound Tad McConahie, a first-team all-district and second-team all-state lineman who chose FIU over several schools, including Auburn and The University of Florida.
FIU also added defensive lineman Jarvis Penerton (South Dade), who passed up offers from Florida, Iowa, Oregon and Louisville to join the Golden Panthers.
Though Clark was only hired three weeks ago, he did have an immediate impact on recruitment - specifically the signing of Hillsborough  linebacker Brandon Hart , a three-year all conference member and grandson of 1949 Notre Dame Heisman Trophy winner Leon Hart.
Both Strock and Clark also addressed the need for improvement in size of FIU's defensive backs. The secondary received five recruits, including Sunrise Piper defensive back Jack Roberts, who chose FIU over Virginia Tech, Michigan State, North Carolina State, Pittsburgh, UCF and FAU. 
The Golden Panthers also added Pahokee strong safety Andrae Swaby, who runs a 4.4 40-yard-dash and came highly recommended by former New Orleans Saints linebacker Rickey Jackson.  
Strock was busy on the offensive side of the ball as well.
The offense added two additional all-state athletes in Longwood Lyman running back Jamicah "JJ" Bass, who Strock referred to as "a steal," and Tallahassee, Florida running back/defensive back Lionell Singleton, who runs the 40 in 4.5 seconds.
But perhaps the biggest signing was that of Homestead quarterback Tavares Kendrick, ranked the 17th best overall prospect in Miami-Dade by The Miami Herald. Kendrick, the Miami-Dade County Coach's 2004 Player of the Year, chose FIU over a host of big-name schools including Ohio State, Pittsburgh, N.C. State, Syracuse, Rutgers and USF. 
Strock described Kendrick as "a tremendous blue-chip athlete," with "great size, speed and a cannon of an arm."
"[Kendrick] came to a lot of our games. He likes the offense that we run - most quarterbacks would - and I think he made his decision just a day or so ago," Strock said. "He's a great talent and a guy we're thrilled to have."
FIU added another quarterback in Orange Park's North Florida all-star and three time all-county quarterback Mike Chapman. 
When asked about the addition of the two quarterbacks, Strock said last year's injury to starting quarterback Jamie Burke left the team with only two quarterbacks for the remaining 11 games of the season, putting the team "in a precarious position to be in." 
Strock also noted that quarterback David Tabor will be a senior next year and though young in its program, the team must start preparing for the future.
Strock also added a pair of solid wide receivers in North Miami Beach's team captain and MVP Schneider Julian, whose speed Strock would only say "is really, really fast," and Sunrise Piper's Julius Mincey, who chose FIU over Michigan State, Tennessee, Georgia Tech, Iowa State and UCF.
The only area in which Strock would have liked to see more signing was that of offensive linemen. However, Strock noted that some of the newly recruited defensive linemen played both sides of the ball in high school.  
"When you talk to these men nowadays, their attitude is 'whatever gets me on the field,' so once they get here I'm sure they will be willing to adjust," he said.
Strock hopes this year's signings will help fill the gaps in the program's transition from I-AA to I-A in the Sun Belt Conference by the 2006 season.

&nbsp;
Jan. 31 - FIU 70, UALR 56

The Lady Golden Panthers continued their strong play as of late, defeating Arkansas-Little Rock 70-56 Jan. 31 at the Golden Panther Arena. 

Three FIU players scored in double figures, led by junior Milena Tomova's 20 points and eight rebounds.

Junior Deniz Box ignited a spark, scoring 10 straight points in the early going, giving FIU a 12-8 lead with 12:25 to go in the first half. 

"She was balling," said point-guard Ivelina Vrancheva. "She played good." 

FIU led by as many as seven points three times during the first half, but UALR's Alicia Cash hit a jumper with five seconds left in the half to cut FIU's lead to five at 29-24.

However, the little momentum Cash gained before the half was quickly erased as the Lady Golden Panthers came out of the gates firing. FIU shot 50 percent (12 for 24) from the field, 75 percent (3 for 4) from the three point line and 83 percent (10 for 12) at the free throw line in the second half.

Jello Moore also chipped in with eight rebounds (four of them offensive) in the second half and finished the game with eight points and 10 rebounds. 

Tomova scored 14 points in the second half and was perfect from the free-throw line. 

Vrancheva added 10 points and four assists in the second half and finished the game with 15 points, five rebounds and six assists. 

FIU outscored Arkansas-Little Rock 41-32 during the second half, earning 11 second-chance points while Little Rock only managed to get two. 

But it was the Lady Panther defense that set the tone early, holding the Lady Trojans to 36 percent shooting in the first half.

"It's all about defense," said Vrancheva after the game. "Defense wins games."

Cash led UALR with 18 points and eight rebounds, and Tamara Humphrey finished with 10 points and four boards in the losing cause.

FIU improved to 10-10, (4-3 Sun Belt) and completed the season sweep of the Trojans after a 66-57 victory on the road on Jan. 4.

Feb. 2 - FIU 67, ASU 57

The Lady Golden Panthers got their revenge.

After a heartbreaking, last-second loss to Arkansas State on Jan. 6, FIU regrouped and defeated the first place team in the Sun Belt, 67-57, at the Golden Panther Arena on Feb. 2.

Milena Tomova and Ivelina Vrancheva led all scorers with 23 points apiece. 

The duo was unstoppable as they ran circles around Arkansas State's defense and heard thunderous applause from the 620 people in attendance.

FIU led by as many as nine points twice during the first half of play. An assist from Vrancheva and a layup by Lasma Jekabsone gave the Lady Golden Panthers their first nine-point lead of the half, making the score 15-5 with 13:38 left in the first half. 

Jello Moore demonstrated her ability to pick up the scraps as she added a career and game-high 12 rebounds on the night. 

"She has very good defense, that's why she plays most [of] the whole game," said Vrancheva. "She's the best rebounder on the team." 

Tomova displayed her own moves in the open court as she ran full court three times on fast-breaks to convert a scoop shot once and hitting two free-throws after getting fouled another time. 

Although she still seems to be plagued by a knee injury, Tomova has fought through it and the results have been good. She's averaged double-figures the past two games after not playing much last week against New Mexico State. 

Vrancheva seemed to look for her shot more this game rather than be the assist-master she normally is. She finished the game with only three assists.

I knew I had to step up," she said. "Allison wasn't getting open and coach wanted me to shoot the ball."

Both teams played evenly in the first half and FIU went to halftime hanging onto a 30-29 lead. 

But the Lady Indians came out strong in the second half. They outscored FIU 10-2 during the first three minutes and took a 39-32 lead. FIU regained the lead on a hoop by Tomova with 9:26 remaining, putting the Lady Panthers up 48-47. 

Two free throws by Vrancheva made the score 52-51 with 5:44 to go, and FIU would not trail again.

Vrancheva finished with 23 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Tomova finished with 23 points, three rebounds and three blocks. Both Deniz Boz and Allison Bustamante chipped in with eight points apiece.

Two Arkansas State players ended the game with double-doubles. Catriece Webster scored 13 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and Adrianne Davie finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds in the loss.

FIU improved to 11-10 on the season and 5-3 in Sun Belt play.

Headline: Offensive struggles continue for men's basketball in loss to Western Kentucky
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU could not crack their first Sun Belt Conference victory of the season against defending champion Western Kentucky as the Hilltoppers defeated FIU 55-42 this past Saturday night at the Golden Panther Arena.

WKU, the three time Sun Belt Conference defending champion, sent FIU to its ninth straight loss and 14th in the past 15 games. FIU's record now drops to 3-16 on the season and 0-7 in the Sun Belt Conference.

Once again, the Golden Panthers had a rough night shooting as the team shot 31 percent in the first half. Things did not get any better in the second half as Western Kentucky went on a 13-3 with 14 minutes to go in the game, giving the Hilltoppers a 33-22 lead. 

The slow offensive start seems to be a repeating pattern, for a FIU team that has not scored more than 58 points since a Dec. 27 win against Sam Houston St.

"I wonder sometimes if we are a little nervous coming out. I shook up the lineup for this game because I wanted us to get off to a better start with more energy, aggressiveness and more fire," said Marsh, who started Gabriel Lazo over Marcus Robinson at the point guard position.

FIU found a burst of energy and went on an 8-0 to cut the lead to 36-30 with 10:19 to play, but it was the closest FIU would get. WKU scored nine of the final 14 points in the game. The Golden Panthers shot 36 percent in the second half and a dreadful 34 percent for the night.

Nigel Dixon led the Hilltoppers with 15 points and 16 rebounds as the former FSU player played a team-high 34 minutes. Mike Wells also added 15 points for WKU as he converted a game-high three shots from downtown. Marsh acknowledged the level of play of Dixon and Wells.

"We had trouble stopping Dixon as most of the league does. He's a big boy and if he gets a good low post position, he is difficult to stop. Wells hit those two three's in the first half that really hurt us."

Guards Marcus Robinson and Carlos Morban led the Golden Panthers with 10 points apiece. Raphael daSilva added seven points and three rebounds. 

Trying to look for a new spark in the lineup, Marsh decided to start Lazo ahead of Robinson at the point guard position because Lazo is more point guard oriented.

"Marcus had struggled the last three games shooting, so I felt this would help him sit there and get his nerves under control and come in as a wing guy and get comfortable," said Marsh. "He scored 10 points and if he can get that contribution to 13, 14, 15 and get Morban to do the same, you know that's an extra 10 points."

Robinson was not pleased with coming of the bench.

"I'm not concerned with that. He has his reasons for doing that and I don't know what those are. You need to ask him that. I am not worried because I will still go out there and do my thing regardless of whether I come off the bench," Robinson said.

Harry Lum, a key contributor all season, played only three minutes in the game for FIU.

"I just felt Harry kind of needed a wake up call that you have to commit to play both ends of the court. I felt like Harry had not fully committed to both ends of the floor so I had to go to a lineup where guys had committed to both ends," said Marsh.

For the fourth time in five games, FIU failed to score more than 50 points. 

"The thing that hurt us most of the year came back to hurt us again, which was we didn't make shots and couldn't score. We didn't necessary turn it over, we just weren't hitting shots and that's one of the Achilles we have," said Marsh.

After a Morban lay-up with two seconds left, FIU was able to avoid the record for fewest points scored in a game, which was set at 41 in a game against Florida State back on November 25, 1994.

"It was a tough game because we were playing good but scoring 42 points is not going to win us games. Somehow we just have to figure out ways to score more," said daSilva.

Despite the low scoring, FIU only allowed 55 points to WKU who had scored 110 in their previous game against Louisiana Lafayette. 

"I though we defended well enough to win the game. Fifty-five points, that should be good enough to put you in a position to win the game," said Marsh. "Our guys played with energy, but sure we can ask our guys to defend harder, but scoring 42 points is not going to win you games."

Added Robinson: "We played good defense, but we just can't get enough attempts at the basket to score more points. We need to get out and run more because when we score that amount of points it's hard to beat teams."

Marsh wants to challenge the inside guys to step up and provide low post threats to opposing teams.

"We just have to get better production from our inside guys. Byron Burnett and Taurance Johnson struggled. We need to get more production down there in order to put up some more points," said Marsh of the two players, who combined for 3-of-10 shooting.
The loss was also the 11th in a row for FIU against Western Kentucky dating back to 2000.

"We played them as well as anybody has in the course of the league all this years. We have always played hard against them but they have always found ways to win. It's frustrating because that's always one of the teams you'd love to have a win against," said Marsh.

There's not much time for Marsh and his team to make a comeback as FIU needs to desperately string together some conference wins.

"I think for us, we can't think of the remaining seven Sun Belt Conference games until we can close at one. Until our kids get that feeling of closing out one game, we can't think of the second or third and so on. If it's going to happen, something has to happen to us real soon because only eight teams make it to the tournament," Marsh said.

I can't exactly say that this is a letter to the editor, however, it is a request; an offer; a fair responsibility of a FIU.  Besides, in all honesty, I haven't read a copy of the Beacon since I graduated in December of 2001.

My name is Lawrence Hyman (pennamed Lawrence Question MarkX).  I attended FIU from May 2000 to December 2001.  In that time, I took anywhere from 15 to 21 credits per semester.  I graduated the four-year university system in a stern 2.5 years with a respectable GPA of 3.4.
I recieved a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology.  While attending FIU in my final two semesters (Summer and Fall of 2001) I wrote a book, that I since (as of April 2001) have had published.  It was self-published with a sub-par publisher.  Either way, an alumist wrote a book and got it published.  In efforts to promote my book, I visited both campuses and found in both bookstore a section that was designated for FIU authors.  Both library directors explained to me that this section was for faculty and staff who have written books.  And both naunchalantly brushed me off by giving me the 'yeah we can order it and place it in the general interest section.'  I know that no order was ever placed.  My question is this: Is it more prestigeous for a student to write a book, or the professors who in a sense are getting paid because they have the expertise in the field they are instructing and thus should be obligated to write books?  The title of my book (my first) is The Evidence of a Cluttered Mind...the New Testament.  Since my first boook, I have written three others and am currently about a 1/3 way through my fifth and last book in the writing format I am currently using (acrostics -- sort of like acronyms).  And, on top of this, I recieve letters from the FIU Alumni Association who constantly asks me for money and donations, but for the most part could probably care less about who I am and what I have done with my life since exiting the FIU educational process.  I could go into more detail about the book, but since I am not sure that this is really a letter to the editor or not, I can offer you my website so that if you have any interest in learning more about me and my book and my project (in which I have posted my FIU diploma on my website) please check my website out at www.theclutteredmind.com.  I couldn't tell you if the Beacon does follow-ups on past FIU students who are suceeding in the world or not.  But, if the Beacon is not, it could be a good idea to start here.  Start caring about the students who attend and no longer attend FIU, for you all will eventually graduate also and wownder why your school paper could care less, regardless of how the Alumni Association will care less but still ask for money on a bi-monthly effort.  

For a student who came, saw, and conqured the educational process in only 2.5 years, ones intellectual capacity should not go unnoticed.  His work should be analyzed and if worthy, reviewed by the paper.  In three years I will have written five books.  The explanation as to why the other four books have not been released is explained in the 'Publisher Problem' section of my website.  This will add some credibility to my case.  My other question is: Why doesn't FIU have a book press (school publisher).  From what I have heard, FIU is supposed to have a decent Creative Writting Program.  For so many students who are in this program, why not offer those students who excell a platform to get their writting out there into the world.

Thank you to whom ever is reading this.  If you have any further questions or a reply, please do so to lqmx@theclutteredmind.com

Sincerely,
An FIU alumnist
Lawrence Question MarkX

&nbsp;
If President Bush runs on his record--especially on the War on Terror an national security he will win in a landslide. All Kerry has to do is try and explain why he was against the Gulf War but for Operation Iraqi Freedom. In Operation Desert Storm we pushed the Iraqis out of Kuwait, a soverign nation. We also protected Saudi Arabia from being overtaken by Saddam Hussein. In addition, we also defended Israel from Saddam's attacks during the Gulf War. But in Operation Iraqi Freedom Iraq was not being beligerant to its surrounding nations. Where is Kerry's logic and judgment? Did Kerry base his support for Operation Iraqi Freedom on the fact that it was largely supported by the American people and he knew he was running for President? Does Kerry have ANY principles at all? Doesn't seem that way. He has flip-flopped on every major issue. He voted against the kind of weapons we need to defend the homeland. He voted against the weapons that won us the Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom. He voted to weaken our intelligence--so I have no confidence that he will improve our failed intelligence agencies--agencies vital to homeland security. 

If Bush runs on his record it will show a principled Conservative. Some things he supported failed--but he didn't change his mind on his principles because it didn't work like Kerry is doing with Operation Iraqi Freedom. His position for the War on Terror benefited him when the war was popular--but didn't benefit him as a DEMOCRAT candidate for President. So what did he do? He "changed his mind." 

He supported Bush's tax cuts, but as candidate he is against it because it is unpopular in his party. He may be riding high in the saddle within his own party but when it comes to November 2004 he will lose as badly as Dukakis did when he faced the elder President Bush--unless the entire country goes mad. How is Kerry going to run against a largely successful President? His tax cuts got us out of the Clinton-Gore recession. Despite the job losses reported by the Democrat party, the jobs loss was substantially less than the jobs lost when Clinton sought re-election. 

How is Kerry, the Vietnam War traitor going to stand up next to President Bush--the commander-in-chief who got the butcher of Baghdad Saddam Hussein? 

Even if President Bush shirked his duties as a national guardsman he is a successful commander-in-chief who made decisive actions based on principles rather than political expediency. Kerry, you are not running against a national guardsman. You, member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War---are Senator Kerry--running on an extreme left-wing Senate record against President/Commander-in-Chief Bush who ran a successful campaign against Saddam and Al Qaeda. Just wanted to remind you as a public service.

If President Bush runs on his record--especially on the War on Terror and national security he will win in a landslide. All Kerry has to do is try and explain why he was against the Gulf War but for Operation Iraqi Freedom. In Operation Desert Storm we pushed the Iraqis out of Kuwait, a soverign nation. We also protected Saudi Arabia from being overtaken by Saddam Hussein. In addition, we also defended Israel from Saddam's attacks during the Gulf War. But in Operation Iraqi Freedom Iraq was not being beligerant to its surrounding nations. Where is Kerry's logic and judgment? Did Kerry base his support for Operation Iraqi Freedom on the fact that it was largely supported by the American people and he knew he was running for President? Does Kerry have ANY principles at all? Doesn't seem that way. He has flip-flopped on every major issue. He voted against the kind of weapons we need to defend the homeland. He voted against the weapons that won us the Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom. He voted to weaken our intelligence--so I have no confidence that he will improve our failed intelligence agencies--agencies vital to homeland security.

Headline: United States' future shaky in hands of new generation punk rock voters
Author: Hans Zeiger/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
In its dirge entitled, "Generation Lost," the punk rock band Rise Against screams, "Getting trampled under boots of progess / Ignore the pleading of the nameless faces / Now with our backs against the wall / How long til we fall?" It would be an appropriate question about a generation of Americans lost, literally, to abortion. 

Not surprisingly, the vociferations of "Generation Lost" have nothing to do with the tragedy of abortion and much to do with lamenting what Rise 

Against perceives as immense misfortune, pain, poverty and hopelessness amongst young punks as perpetrated by the family, religion, the pro-life movement and George W. Bush.

Rise Against was a congruent addition to the line-up of punk rockers at a pro-abortion orgy late Thursday night at a Washington, D.C., nightclub co-sponsored by NARAL Pro-Choice America and Punkvoter.com. 
Joining Rise Against were the bands Against Me!, None More Black and Anti-Flag. One Anti-Flag song entitled "No Apology" is an apparent refusal to apologize to aborted babies for having taken their lives. 

"Making it illegal won't make it go away ... the issue for (pro-lifers) isn't life, its control! Control of what we do and say but you'll never gain control!" And in its "pro-choice" anthem, "Right to Choose," Anti-Flag screams out a motto for what NARAL calls Generation Pro-Choice: "I'm f-ing free!!" 

Outgoing NARAL Pro-Choice America president Kate Michelman was present at the Punk Rock Abortion Party Thursday, telling rebellious pro-abortion punks, "Young people who've never lived in a time when they didn't have the right to choose shouldn't wake up one day in a world they don't recognize." Michelman and Anti-Flag lead singer Justin Sane announced an ambitious new plan to empower the next generation of pro-abortion activists through the Internet, alternative news sources and drug-laden punk rock concerts. "We must defend a woman's right to choose while she still has it!" proclaimed Sane. 

Punkvoter.com was founded as a "voter education organization" to "register and mobilize over 500,000 of today's youth as one voice" in voting against George W. Bush and opposing his pro-life policies and the war on terror. 

Among hundreds of Punkvoter.com member groups are the popular bands Green Day, Foo Fighters, NOFX and Bad Religion. In the customary spirit of the movement, Bad Religion said, "I hate my family, hate my school, speed limits and the golden rule." Death is better than living in a world of rules and morals, according to Bad Religion. Why then, asks the hate band, "do we pity the dead?" Bad Religion concludes, "The dead are better off than we." 

So it is clear - the abortion industry and the punk rock industry are a natural partnership. One legion preaches death as another executes it. "I want to die today, f-ing die today," are the lyrics of a two-month old St. Louis punk band called Today's Abortion. In 2001, the band Toys that Kill released its first CD entitled, "The Citizen Abortion," with songs like "Mating Season" and "Bullet from the Sky." Another band called Butthole Surfers has a CD on the market entitled "Locust Abortion Technician," in one song of which a young boy is instructed to hate his mother for giving birth to him: "If you see your mom this weekend, / Be sure and tell her, SATAN, SATAN, SATAN!!!" 

We live in the midst of a youth culture that celebrates rebellion and rage in its entertainment. And we live equally in a culture of death that exalts abortion to the count of 43 million since Roe v. Wade, that has exacted most of a billion dollars from the paychecks of American taxpayers over the past year for "family planning," that cares neither for life nor the quality of life, that spits upon dignity and curses God. 

The indelible link between abortion and its gospel singers is not to be ignored. NARAL Pro-Choice America and Punkvoter.com may symbolize the more vocal movement of a divided culture, but they can never stand for America's future. For if America's bards continue screaming for death and America's youth continue their comfortable march toward the clinic at the beat of the CD speakers, America will surely die.

Headline: Bush needs to take responsibility for WMD assumptions
Author: Ted Randall/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
President Bush's decision to appoint a committee to investigate the accuracy of pre-invasion intelligence gathering is nothing but a witch hunt. Bush is looking for a scapegoat - CIA director George  Tenet and his agency. What this does for Bush, Inc. (Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, and Condolezza Rice) is divert the debate away from the more insidious aspect of Bush's little misadventure - that he mislead America. 

The investigation will fall short of its mark if it does not hold the president accountable for his decision to invade.  

There is enough blame to go around. Certainly the CIA shares some of it. So too does the media because of its lack of scrutiny and its failure to serve as watch dog. Ultimately, Bush, Inc. must be held accountable. 

After all, it cherry picked the intelligence. It sold us the bill of goods. What needs to be investigated is how and why they came to the conclusions they did and why they were so hellbent on going to war. 

After all, there was enough alternative information available to have given them pause.   

I was a Force Recon Marine. My unit had the task of conducting deep pre- and post-assault reconnaissance. I was at the cutting edge of the intelligence gathering sword. As an operator in the field, it was my duty to observe, document, and report information to higher command where they compiled it and presented an intelligence brief to the decision makers. Intel folks gather and analyze. They do not make decisions. It is up to the commanders to make decisions. 

In the case of Tenet and the CIA, agents often risked their lives in Iraq, pouring over raw data and reporting what they saw. Tenet then made his assessment and presented it to the National Security Agency and the president. 

At no time did Tenet define Iraq as an imminent threat. It is well documented that CIA intelligence often contradicted pre-invasion claims being made by the White House, particularly regarding Iraq's nuclear capabilities. The CIA stated that if Iraq had a nuclear program it was years away from producing any of weapons grade material. It was Rumsfeld in August of 2002 who claimed that "Iraq posed an immediate threat to the security of our people." It was Cheney's 2002 claim that "Iraq poses as grave a threat as can be imagined." 

It was Mr. Bush who, in his 2002 State of the Union address, claimed that the British government had learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. It was Powell before the entire world that claimed that there were aluminum tubes were for chemical missiles, and that Iraq had remotely piloted vehicles capable of delivering biological agents on U.S. soil. 

They all claimed Iraq had tons of chemical and biological weapons, all of which may have existed at one time. 

More bio-chem substances have been found in the offices of congress than in Iraq. It was Bush who told congress that Iraq was an imminent threat. In September of 2002, Bush stated that "according to the British government, Iraq could launch chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes after the order was given." If these weapons could have been launched so hastily, why weren't they easily found? To launch a missile, it has to be quickly and easily accessible, right? Like our minute man missiles? And lets face it people, years of crippling, genocidal sanctions had left Iraq crippled, incapable of even feeding its people let alone a WMD program. What was an imminent threat a year ago is now a legacy of deceit. 

Press Secretary Scott McClellan has gone so far as to deny that the White House had made the claim that Iraq posed an imminent threat. The decision to invade Iraq was the president's, not Tenet's. It was a criminally negligent choice. Perhaps Bush really is what his former treasury secretary likened him to, "a blind man in a roomful of deaf people." 

Now, Bush is no longer claiming that WMD's will be found. What was once a full fledged WMD program capable of killing Americans is now simply referred to as a weapons of mass destruction-related activity. As Bush stated to Diane Sawyer several weeks ago, "what is the difference?" 

The buck stops you know where. 

It's saddening to think of the more than 500 American service men and women who have died, of the thousands who lie injured and of the the thousands of innocent Iraq is who have perished because of false pretenses.

The decision to invade was not the result of pre-war intelligence gathering but of selective intelligence assessments made by the White House. It was Bush who violated international law by conducting a pre-emptive unilateral war of choice. Whatever its motives, Bush, Inc. should be held before a grand jury to explain to the American people how and why it came to the conclusions it did. It is Bush, Inc., not the CIA, who must be held accountable for the thousands of dead and wounded.

Headline: 'Morning-after' pill should be sold, but not over-counter
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration met with its advisory committee, which recommended in an overwhelming 23-4 vote, that the contraceptive medications Plan B and Preven, also known as the "morning-after" pill, should be made available over-the-counter, as easily as aspirin. A need to widen the availability of the drug is necessary, but restrictions should be applied.

Experts feel emergency contraception would be readily available at a pharmacy. Last year, nearly 12,000 prescriptions were provided for the "morning-after" pill, preventing nearly 677 pregnancies in the United States, half of which would have resulted in abortion.

Few students are aware of the drug's existance and potentially harmful  side effects - vomiting, irregular menstruation, and infertility.   While long-term studies have yet to be conducted, questions remain about the drug's safety. Preven was approved in 1998 by the FDA, and Plan B as recently as 1999. 

The free sale of such a medication would inevitably lead to misuse. The medication is in fact a kind of birth control concentrate, containing the same hormones present in birth control pills.

A behind-the-counter, non-prescription "morning-after" pill would be the solution. Pharmacists should dispense the drug from behind the counter, without prescription. The pharmacists would then inform consumers of the side-effects and proper usage of the drug. The consumer would sign a release stating that they understand what has been explained to them. 

This consultation would ensure that consumers would be clear about the potential risks of using the drug and the drug's proper and effective dosage. 

Pharmacists should also inform consumers that they can exercise discretion to withhold dispensing the drug to those who might be using it irresponsibly. They should also limit the dispensing of the drug to one dosage per visit.

While an ideal solution would be to have doctors prescibe the drug, waiting for an appointment isn't an option - the drug should be taken within 72 hours of intercourse - and scheduling an appointment might complicate matters for underaged or uninsured patients and limit the drug's availability.

As with any drug that may have potentially harmful side effects, steps should be taken to ensure that the drug is not misused and that professional health care providers stay in touch with those taking the medication to make sure consumpers are aware of those health risks.

Headline: With closing of Gables Pub, era ends
Author: Andy Diaz/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
The first time I ever got drunk will always be one of my most vivid college memories. The experience probably wouldn't be so memorable if it didn't also comprise, along with an introduction to what the faint of heart might erroneously denote as binge drinking, a series of personal inaugurations to events and experiences that shaped the collegiate zeitgeist for me. 

I had just become an assistant editor for The Beacon and it was the first time I hung out with my newspaper comrades - all of which drank prodigiously and politicked with a gregarious ease that intimidated my freshman ass into increasing my rate of consumption. Expectedly, the debut of my drinking career was accompanied by the subsequent introduction to puking. 

It was also the first time I had been to the Gables Pub, a dingy little hangout that in the years to come became my de facto drinking place that, as of recently, is no more, it's closing, the salient sign of the end of an era.

Looking back on it, there was nothing really outstanding about the Pub, as it was known to those of us in the know, or those who threw up once or twice while sitting on the curb in front. It was its rather unostentatious qualities that drew me to it. On its best nights, which were probably Sunday and Monday nights, I remember the editorial staff rushing through our Beacon work so we could go get a drink, or two, or three - the Pub was just a quiet place to hang out after an afternoon of editing mediocre columns and letters to the editor. 

The place wasn't lacking a wild side, however. On "Ladies' Night," the Pub was bipolarly different. More than once, perfectly dignified thirty-something women shimmied their way toward me upon their leggy sublimity as I stood by the bar waiting for a drink, bumped and grinded momentarily and then went on their way with a smile on their faces leaving me with an evanescent taste of what I would not gorge on later that night.

The Pub did have a quality which set it aside from the rest of the bars in Miami. It was a place where an 18-year-old college freshman with a conspicuously pre-pubescent look could go and order a drink without being hassled or carded. But underage drinking wasn't the only form of delinquency going on. The multipurpose terrace behind served as the pantheon for those with more marginal tastes. Smoke or snort, whatever your effete persuasion, you could do it alfresco without anyone caring. The Pub's anachronistic attitude and its unwillingness to adapt to the draconic fun-hating civil laws of our time, became apparent once more when recently Florida practically outlawed smoking in most neighborhood bars, turning your average amicable bartender into another low-level bureaucrat more concerned with policing his denizens more fearful of a hefty fine than caring for the wellbeing of their buzz. 

The appeal of the place wasn't exactly universal though. I remember dragging several dates along with me who, after a first look around, grimaced briefly and having nothing substantiative or positive to say, described it as "mellow" - the most insipid and meaningless word in the parlance of the middle class soi-disant New Age neo-hippies that trapse through our university.

Reading over this column, I find myself now distant from the me that used to enjoy the Pub, and didn't mind drinking there three to four times a week.

Now that I'm legally able to drink, it seems a bit maniacal to go to the same bar continuously and never get bored of it. Just to give you an idea how often I was there, I spent my 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd birthdays at the Pub. I'm sure those younger than me, with an equal will to defy drinking age restrictions, will find similar places where they can smoke and drink. 

As for me, I'm not sure if it's because I'll never have another drink at the Pub and, in a Proustian way, reminisce about that first drink/puke fest, or because I discovered the Pub at the beginning of my college years and it has now closed down during my last undergraduate semester, I can't help, and hopefully won't be blamed for, feeling slightly emotional.

Headline: Anatomy of a party
Subheadline: Inventive parties create lasting memories
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
It's 6:30 a.m., I haven't slept all night, and my party is officially over. I realize the magnitude of the mess that faces me as the first few rays of sunlight begin to creep in through the window blinds. Slowly, the stains become visible to me and I replay each one in my head. 

Potato chip crumbs on the linoleum floor stick to my bare feet along with the spilt soda's  sticky residue. I stumble on a few red cups that lie strewn about, some still glimmering with red punch. As I pass the bathroom, the stench of putrid vomit hits my nose and I cringe, vowing to fix the paper-clogged toilet later; in secret, hoping one of my roommates does before I do. 

A hurricane of party-goers has just passed through my tiny college apartment. The aftermath of such a gathering is never pleasant and with hours of cleaning work ahead of me, the only thing I can think of is my disheveled and lonely bed; sheets hanging on the floor and pillows in disarray. 

It's been a crazy night and it only seems logical to avoid sleep and make sense of it all, besides I have to leave for work in a few hours. I'm not quite sure how to answer the questions that loom over my head.

How is it that parties have become such an integral part of the college experience and what is it that drives us to throw them, risking eviction and other serious consequences if caught by the university? It's not rebellion, I never was one to rebel for the sake of rebelling. It's not the urge for alcohol consumption, I'm a wuss and I have never been one to enjoy the fruits of intoxication.

The logistics of the situation were against me from the beginning. There exists an official housing rule, only allowing 10 people inside my apartment at one time; the 60 plus guests expected were bound to create a problem. The small size of the living room also created trouble, the spilling in and out of party goers attracted unwanted attention. Throw alcohol into the mix and the end result is bound to produce something consequential, especially living on a dry campus.

This all brings me back the original question: Why? 

I suppose its the beauty of a well-organized party. The nod, if you will. The "awesome party," comments and the feeling that I've created something special and unique. 

Just throwing a little party is easy but staging an eventful and memorable event is like solving a differential equation. It takes creativity, weeks of planning, word-spreading, and diligence. 

The party responsible for the disgusting mess I have to clean, for example, was '80s themed. All of our guests were required to dress in their best retro outfits, the soundtrack contained roughly seven hours of nostalgic music, and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" was looped throughout the entirety of the party. We even named our event, "Happy New Year 1984."

On some unconscious level, I decided the potential risks involved were worth the allure of throwing an '80s party, especially considering my recent fondness of the era. Perhaps my visions of grandeur go too far. After an hour of dancing and a retro fashion show complete with prizes, (we awarded the winners with vintage vinyl LPs) sure enough, the inevitable rulebook came crashing down and I - being the responsible party-thrower - took the liberty of shutting it down: I turn on the lights, kill the music, toss the alcohol and firmly ask for the hastefull departure of my guests, after a sincere apology of course.

This being the first time I had ever put together and successfully carried out an event of such a magnitude, I felt a bit crushed. Even more so when the flashing blue and red lights of the police arrived to make sure I had dispersed my gathering. It's a bit of a spirit-killer to have to shut down what I worked so hard on and on top of that, answer to the fuzz. No harsh feelings on either of our sides, they were just doing their jobs and I did mine. The last thing you want to do in a situation like that is not comply with authority and besides I don't have nearly enough guts to talk back. Thank goodness I'm such a wimp.

I digress and I don't want to blame anyone for the demise of the party. 

The point of everything is that this entire process of putting on a great party, getting shut down and knowing you have created endless memories is something I suggest everyone experience. Besides the obvious potential for fun, its a part of growing up. Doing exciting things that push the envelope a little, testing the deep end of the pool, so to speak. Even more so, nothing beats the feeling of a positive gathering of people. The loving vibe was so overwhelming; smiles all up and down, laughter and unity. Bringing friends together like that, even if only for an hour, is an experience with rewards well worth the consequences I faced.

After such an ordeal though, I don't know if I can ever regain the energy to try and put on such an event again in the future. I already know it's literally impossible to get around the rules set in place in an on-campus housing facility and I don't need to prove it to myself again or create any more memories.

 "Happy New Year 1984" was well-lived for its hour of glory. Who knows? Maybe I'll even repeat the event in the future, somewhere off-campus. All the memories I have left are smile-riddled pictures and a few questionable stains that may require some extensive cleaning. That's good enough for me.

Headline: Dutch Grimm loses all meaning in pointless endeavors
Author: Maggie Perez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Hypothetically speaking, the Dutch film "Grimm" had everything a movie could offer. It had its share of incest, murder, illegal organ transplants, and - most importantly - a donkey. "Grimm" is in every way an absurd movie. 

The movie follows the lives of two siblings, Marie (Halina Reijn) and Jacob (Jacob Derwig) after their father abandons them in the woods. Equipped with only an ax and a note directing them to go to their uncle's house in Spain, the siblings are determined to reach their destination. From this point in the movie until the end, it was almost like writer/director Alex van Warmerdam thought, "Hmm...what kind of dysfunctional things can I make these kids go through?" 

Marie and Jacob end up killing a dog for nourishment and its owner forces Jacob to have sex with his wife because, as the owner states, "she doesn't get it from me." 

After the grueling sex scene with the 300-pound woman, Jacob and Marie hitchhike into the city, acquire a moped, experiment with prostitution, and commit murder. 

Wow, all this in a half hour. After meeting a handsome stranger, Marie and Jacob head off to his Spanish mansion only to find out later it was all a ploy to remove a kidney for his dying sister. Once again, it just seemed like another strange, kooky event to add into the movie.

The movie seemed to have no real point, other than to show the siblings endure sickening situations. I will say, however, it was extremely entertaining. The movie never reached a dull point but it never really made sense either. It seemed like the scenes were just stitched together without being able to flow well into one another. 

Quite possibly, the most important question could be asked right after the siblings escape from the maniacal kidney thief and end up in what looks like to be a western ghost town. Where did that come from?

 In regards to the ending, let's just say one might find more closure pondering the meaning of life or how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.

But, for all the nonsensical series of events in the movie, it was well written and often very funny and clever. Von Warmerdam did an excellent job at holding one's attention throughout the entire movie. 

Perhaps it had no real point or message, but at least the audience can walk away with yet another example of the saying, "Never talk to strangers," because you'll never know if they want to force you to have sex with their obese spouse or cut out your liver.
