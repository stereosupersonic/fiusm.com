Headline: Budget cuts loom
Subheadline: Overwhelming Bright Futures student involvement conspicuously absent from tuition, budget issue
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
When Gov. Bush proposed his budget, it sent Florida public university administrators into a swoon.

And likely no university felt that impact as strongly as FIU did. Perpetually under-funded and over-burdened, FIU was looking at potentially catastrophic cuts.

That budget was, after all, a worse case scenario, and few worse case scenarios forecast a sunny future.

Neither of the two budgets passed through the state's house or senate are as severe as Gov. Bush's initial forecast. That's not to say that we're out of the woods here. We still face, as Steve Sauls, vice provost for governmental affairs, put it: "Probably the most serious budget situation that the university has ever faced."

But if administrators had to pick one, according to Sauls, they would "definitely" prefer to see the Senate's bill become reality. 

Though, to judge by the atmosphere on campus, students are apparently unaware that there even is a budget crises looming.

By the numbers

Tuition increases, under either of these budgets, is a forgone conclusion. 

 "There is a strong reservation and concern about graduate tuition or out of state tuition going up ... because price for out of state and international students is less elastic than, say, undergraduate tuition ... out of state tuition is not far away from the national average, where our instate, undergraduate tuition is substantially below the national average," Sauls explained. "We're super sensitive to how we price."

The Senate bill would have tuition for instate, undergraduate students increased by 7.5 percent, while other students not falling under that category, i.e. graduate and international students, would see a 10 percent increase.

The House bill, the more severe of the two, would have tuition for instate, undergraduate students going up by 12.5 percent, and would set no cap for hikes on other students.

The Senate bill also provides $8.1 million more in PECO funding, money awarded to universities for the expansion of facilities. While both bills provide enough money for the construction of the new law school facilities, the house bill does not include funding for a $5 million chiller, a central component of the incoming building's air conditioning system. 

I suppose few members of the house have spent time in Miami's heat. No air conditioner? The chiller might be more important to students than funding for the building itself. 

The house bill also does not provide funds through the Courtelis Facility Matching Grants system, which matches grants made by the private sector to FIU. That adds up to nearly $1 million. Or for Challenge Grants Matching Gifts, roughly another $8 million for additional facilities, $5 million of which were for the College of Engineering building. The Senate does.

Neither of the bills provides money for enrollment growth, money awarded to universities to pay for increases in the size of its enrollment, though a budget plan passed by the Senate would use money raised from new taxes, or from taxes on video slots placed in horse and dog race tracks, to curtail some of those cuts and to fund a portion of the enrollment growth.

The effect

"The magnitude of the cuts is greater than making marginal adjustments," Sauls said. "It would require some serious change that would be unpleasant in process and effect."

What kind of changes? 

"We would have bigger classes. It would be harder to get the classes you need, and that's already a problem we're well aware of.

"We would have to reduce student services in various ways: you would have longer registration lines, advising would be more difficult, we'd have to look at library hours," Sauls said.

Unpleasant is right. 

Not too late

Students aren't helpless, however. 

Sauls noted that we were well received in Tallahassee for FIU Day, where SGA directly lobbies legislators in Tallahassee. He also noted an appearance in Tallahassee by FIU President Modesto Maidique.

"The president made a very forceful case that the house budget is not good," Sauls said. "We need a stronger hew and cry from people who are affected. You can't sit back and say it's not my business," he added.

A decision has not yet been made, but one could be made as early as May 2. Students must have a hand in the making of that decision. Legislators must know that we do not want our universities to be dismantled. They must know that this education is important to us and our communities.

Where's the outrage?

When Bright Futures scholarships were threatened, there was an immediate reaction by the student body, spearheaded by the exemplary efforts of the Student Government Association and the Florida Student Association. While those efforts were not able to completely curtail the changes to that program, they were able to mitigate some of the harm done to students. 

That is conspicuously missing now. Where are these efforts now? Where is that outrage now? This is a situation more dire and encompassing than Bright Futures ever was. There is not a student on this campus unaffected by what happens in Tallahassee in the next few weeks. 

There are two plans on the table, one obviously worse than the other. A decision will be made. The question remaining is what, if any, role will the students have in the making of that decision? Where are you now?

Headline: Baseball splits series with B-CC
Author: Steve Perhla/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers took a trip to Daytona Beach this week, winning one of two meetings against the Bethune-Cookman Wildcats. FIU now stands at 28-11 on the season. 

B-CC 11, FIU 6

The Golden Panthers were unable to recover from a rocky start by junior pitcher Andrew Edwards, falling to the Wildcats 11-6 on Wednesday.
Edwards (0-2), who returned this season after missing last year with an arm injury, suffered his roughest outing of the year, allowing six earned 
runs in only three innings.

FIU was able to get on the scoreboard first, thanks to a Ricardo Nanita sacrifice fly.

B-CC responded in the bottom half of the inning, tying the game on a Juan Figueroa RBI single.

The Wildcats then jumped on Edwards in the bottom of the third, capped by a Figueroa three-run homer, putting the Wildcats up 6-1 after three innings.

The Panthers found a way to score again in the fourth when senior Solomon Frieder singled home Nanita, cutting the lead to 6-2.
But B-CC pounded out three more runs in the bottom half of the inning, this time off FIU senior Derek Taylor, increasing the Wildcat lead to 9-2.
However, the Golden Panthers struck back again in the fifth. With the bases loaded, senior Skip Adams drove home freshman Luis Rivera with a single. 

Freshman Mike Lopez (2-for-5, two runs) then scored on passed ball, narrowing the deficit to 9-4.

But the Wildcats retaliated again in the bottom of the inning, manufacturing two more runs off Taylor, making the score 11-4.
Frieder (2-for-4, three RBI, run) was able to draw FIU to within five runs when he smashed a two-run shot over the right field fence in the eighth. 
But that was as close as FIU would get.

FIU 4, B-CC 1

The Golden Panthers, led by junior pitcher Josh Banks, shut down the Wildcats of Bethune-Cookman 4-1 on Thursday.

FIU was able to get the scoring going early in the second inning. Senior third baseman Skip Adams got things started with a bunt single. Junior Fernando Alvarez continued with a single to right field. Junior catcher Mario Monreal (2-for-4, RBI) followed with another single, knocking in Adams. Freshman shortstop Luis Rivera (2-for 5, RBI) then extended his 21-game hitting streak with a RBI single to center field, putting the Panthers ahead 2-0. 

Bethune-Cookman was able to stage a minor rally in the fifth, executing three straight singles off Banks, cutting the FIU lead to 2-1.

But the Golden Panther pitching attack would give up nothing more. 

Banks (7-1) dominated the Wildcats, going 6.1 innings, allowing only one earned run on six hits, and striking out four for the win. 

FIU tacked on another run in the sixth thanks to Solomon Frieder. With two outs, Frieder (1-for 4) reached first base on an infield single to the pitcher. Frieder then stole second base, his 10th stolen base out of 12 attempts on the season. The senior outfielder then reached third and home on two passed balls by B-CC pitcher Juan Figueroa, giving the Golden Panthers a 3-1 lead after six innings of play. Freshman second baseman David San Juan added some insurance for the Golden Panthers in the ninth, tripling home Monreal, increasing the FIU advantage to 4-1.
Sophomore Derek DeCarlo sealed the deal for FIU, tossing the final 2.2 innings, allowing only one hit and striking out four.

Santos named Sun Belt Conference Pitcher of the Week

Junior pitcher Arthur Santos was named Sun Belt Conference Pitcher of the Week for his dominating performance against Middle Tennessee State on April 6.

Santos, who started the season 0-5, bounced back to strike out a team season-high 13 batters in the contest.

"I thought I was throwing well all season. I just had some tough breaks early on. But I did what I had to do. You have to just keep chugging along and things will go your way," said Santos.

The 12-0 win marked the first win of the season for Santos.

FIU in the Polls

The Golden Panthers are receiving votes in the latest ESPN Coaches' Poll but remain unranked in the top 25.

Up  Next

FIU faces their cross-town rival the University of Miami on Wednesday. 
The first pitch is set for 7:00 p.m. 

Last season, the largest attendance in University Park Stadium history was on hand to witness a 7-1 FIU win over the Hurricanes. The athletic department is preparing for a similar crowd to be at the game.

The final 15 games of the season for FIU are all against Sun Belt Conference opponents.

The Golden Panthers head on the road to visit Louisiana-Lafayette for a three-game set.

FIU then returns home to host a six-game homestand against New Mexico State and South Alabama before taking to the road again to face the Privateers of New Orleans.

The team closes out the 2003 regular season with three games at University Park against Arkansas State on the 16th, 17th and 18th of May.

The Sun Belt Conference Championships will be held from  May 20th to the 24th in Lafayette, La.

FIU is currently tied atop the conference with South Alabama. Both teams hold a 6-3 record in SBC play.

Headline: Rouco leaving men's basketball for UTEP
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Sergio Rouco, an assistant coach with the men's basketball program for the last three seasons, has accepted a similar position at the University of Texas-El Paso.

"It's exciting to be a part of a great program with a rich history," Rouco said. "I've known [Head Coach] Billy Gillispie for 15 years. I know his enthusiasm and work ethic, and I think we can accomplish a lot together at UTEP. El Paso is similar to Miami with a large Hispanic population."

"I'm really excited about Sergio being a part of our staff," Gillispie said. "He will bring an unbelievable amount of enthusiasm to his job. He is outstanding in every phase of the game. He is a great recruiter, he relates well with the players and he is a fine floor coach, having worked with some very good head coaches."

Rouco first came to FIU in 1987 as an assistant under then head coach, Rich Walker. He then landed the head coaching position at Miami Norland Senior High School. From 1995-98, Rouco had coaching stints in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela before becoming the Director of Athletics at the Boys and Girls Club of Miami from 1997-2000. 
Rouco then reunited with the FIU program under current head coach Donnie Marsh. In his  most recent role, Rouco coordinated the recruitment process at FIU helping land heralded high school talent such as Taurance Johnson and Carlos Morban.

"Not only is he a fine individual, but also an excellent coach," Marsh said. "We're going to miss him."

Subheadline: Reader upset by picture of vice-presidential candidate
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

This letter is directed to the entire editorial board. It is the responsibility of you all to make certain that all articles, captions, headings, pictures, etc. follow ethical guidelines of journalistic writing. 

After seven years of journalism experience, it is utterly disappointing to have come across the picture (1B) and caption on Tuesday's front page. 

Upon endorsing a political candidate, it is their duty to refrain from defamizing [SIC] the character of their running opponent. The picture of Ana Manrara expresses an emotional and personal moment which should not have been exploited by this newspaper. 

Post-elections, comments on Clayton's victory and reactions from Jorge's campaign are certainly acceptable. Yet, you have destroyed the image of what a university publication is supposed to uphold. 

University publications should not be at the hands of political opportunists, who build their support on the basis of defamation. The focus of this and any publication is to report actions, reactions and points of view. Certainly, it is not purposed to emphasize and mock the defeat of any one of its readers. 

I believe that this publication forgot that those who worked and voted for Jorge and Ana make up a significant portion of its audience. At this point, I can assure you that much of that audience has been lost at the disgusting and childish tactics undertaken by whomever proposed and allowed such a picture to be published. 

If our school journalists cannot exalt the foundations of reporting ethic, then what credibility can we expect to gain from further publications?

Dear Editor,
       I'm writing to my Arab friend.I understand his feelings about the U.S. policies in Iraq. He is wrong about it,though. The U. S. doesn't do everything right, of course, but we discuss issues and try to compromise. Many Arab countries don't have free societies where this can take place. I find it ironic that this student would call U.S. a terrorist state while attending school here and voicing his opinion.
        I don't agree with many of George Bush's policies but felt the war was nescessary to protect us and our children from future incidents like on 9-11-2001.
       I would ask only that he keep an open mind.

Subheadline: Parking blocks at BBC parking lots an inconvenience
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

Parking tends to be a problem at most universities across the country.  Usually, there are never enough spaces or the lots are too far.  

While FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus has ample parking, there is one issue that I hate every morning when I arrive for a day of educational enrichment: the huge, horrible cement parking block that adorns the end of nearly every student parking space at the BBC.  

Why do I hate them so much?  I drive a car that sits low to the ground; moreover, it has a front bumper that has a tendency to "eat" objects that are too high off the ground themselves.  

I am extremely careful when it comes to parking my car because I know that the stupid cement block has the potential to completely decapitate my front lower bumper should I park the car in too far.  

There is no need for the block to be so high; it could be 1 inch tall and it would be enough to let a driver know that the car has reached the end of the space. Removing the blocks completely is also a great idea. 

Yes, they are supposed to let drivers know when to stop, at the expense of an entire demographic of people who drive cars that ride low. 

I believe most drivers understand that when their front tires hit the grass in front of the space, they have gone too far.  

Recently, I took my car in for routine maintenance and I found two FIU students having their car repaired because the parking block pulled their bumper off.  

While an SUV owner would never understand, any student or faculty member who drives a car similar to mine knows all too well that the parking blocks at FIU are an awful hindrance.  Every morning it is an inconvenience to have to make sure I do not pull my car in too far, or it will cost me $100.  

The parking blocks have got to go, they serve no purpose other than to possibly subject myself and others to expensive repairs that are inflicted by a terrible engineering design.  

I wonder how much those blocks initially cost FIU. I can assure you that Volkswagen charges plenty to repair a bumper.

I've been working hard on the campaign... To begin with, there are going to be T-shirs (with a cool slogan of "don't burn oil, burn the calories!"). And secondly there's another organization by the same name which has the coolest website (at the bottom). 
 
We will depart from Bayside Marketplace, head north along Biscayne Bl, stop by 79 st (to reach out the community) and finish by FIU... Tentative date would be on a Saturday (to catch the weekend BUT we'll be missing many students at FIU) in a couple of weeks.

Headline: Whether it's a flag or noose, symbols are important
Author: Myriam Marquez / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
For almost an hour, the Iraqi men tried to get the noose around Saddam's big head. They were victorious, with the help of U.S. troops and their armored vehicle, in toppling the statue of the Butcher of Baghdad, erected last year to celebrate Saddam Hussein's 65th birthday. 

We woke up Wednesday to witness history in the making, a sense that the end is near - a turning point of proportions so huge to the Middle East and the world, as the fall of the Berlin Wall was to the collapse of communism in Europe, more than a decade ago.

But there were ominous signs, too, that Americans in Iraq must be overly careful to strike the right balance, to ensure that their actions, even in a brief moment of elation, are not misinterpreted.

Case in point: the fleeting moment in which a U.S. soldier placed the American flag over the Saddam statue's head.

Arab cable network al-Jazeera, rarely missing an opportunity to paint America as the aggressor instead of liberator of Iraq, didn't skip a beat in "interpreting" what seemed to most Americans to be  the exuberance of a young American soldier and nothing more.

"This is a symbol of what will happen now. Everything will take an American face," an al-Jazeera reporter told Arab viewers about the U.S. flag on the Saddam statue's face. "A national symbol is being replaced by an American one."

A minute later, the soldier handed the U.S. flag to a young Iraqi who, smiling and standing atop the base of the statue, waved it to cheers from Iraqis below. The old flag of Iraq waved high - a symbol, al-Jazeera this time accurately noted, of true Iraqi nationalism free of the Saddam imprimatur. The Iraqi dictator changed the flag in 1991 when, having lost the Gulf War, he tried to earn points with radical Islamists by printing a religious saying on the flag. 

We cannot underestimate the meaning of symbols to people who have been spoon-fed ideas through government-controlled media for decades. 

Iraqis, like any other people who have suffered in a dictatorship, are masters at reading between the lines.

Nor can we ignore that Iraq is a nation divided by different ethnic and religious groups that, now free of Saddam, will want to control their own destiny. Democracy and shared power are not acceptable to everyone. 

Many Kurds, for instance, feel they have nothing to gain from sharing power with those who used to oppress them. The Shiites, meanwhile, want to reclaim their old cities and establish a religious government that the once-powerful Sunnis rejected. Then there are progressive, moderate Iraqis who hope to have a secular government that respects individual rights.

But we are getting ahead of ourselves. The war isn't over. As Vice President Dick Cheney warned Wednesday, "There may well be hard fighting ahead. We must expect vicious tactics."

Baghdad was not yet totally secure. And cities in northern Iraq, such as Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, and the oil fields to the north still had pockets of strong resistance.

U.S. and British forces are still looking for those infamous weapons of mass destruction, too - the major reason the Bush administration gave for this war. 

And, of course, securing Iraq's borders is a priority, not only to catch high-ranking officials in Saddam's government who might try to escape, but to ensure that weapons aren't smuggled out of Iraq and into the hands of terrorist groups.

Saddam, who may have been killed by U.S. bombing a few days ago, has more lives than a junkyard cat. But dead or alive, he's clearly no longer in charge of Iraq.

It will be up to the United States and all other nations that value liberty to help Iraqis of good will. They must set aside old grudges and see the bigger picture of peaceful coexistence, so that they will never again have to tie a symbolic noose around a dictator's head.

Headline: Shiite, there's a Kurd in the Iraqi Baath
Author: John Colagrande Jr. / Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
No offense to anyone that may be offended, but what's the deal with the major ethnic and sectarian groups of Iraq? 

What linguist named them? 

The Shiites? Sounds like a hip-hop colloquialism. 

"Yo, peep this. I was at the Biscayne Bay Campus yesterday and this one shorty walked by. Holy Shiite, you should've seen this beeyatch." 

Or, better yet. 

"Last night I was at San Loco at four in the morning eating mad amounts of burritos and the next thing you know my stomach was grumbling a 7.3 on the indigestion scale. I had to take the biggest Shiite."  

Which leads to the next sect. The Turds of Northern Iraq. 

The Turds are very organized. They have over 70,000 men in their military and enjoy a secure level of autonomy up there in Northern Iraq. 

The Turds are friends of the 'coalition of the willing.' They do not spin along the 'axis of evil.' 

The Turds are, wait a minute, mid-sentence here, I have breaking news, ladies and gentlemen, I have breaking news, the capable editors here at The Beacon have just informed me that the Turds are not the Turds but actually the Kurds, that's the Kurds of Northern Iraq, ladies and gentlemen, the Kurds. 

Hey, it's an honest mistake. 

I need to clean my mind. 

It has been in the bathroom for most of this column. Clean my mind. 

Does anybody know the name of the last ruling party in Iraq? The last ruling party in Iraq was the Baath party. That's right, the Baath party. Saddam Hussein was the leader of the Baath party. 

Did the Baath party pride themselves on being clean? 

Or, was it because there was so much blood on their hands they spent a lot of time in the tub? 

I think Mr. Bubbles should be the next leader of the Baath party and Rubber Duckie could be his running mate. Heck, any reasonable Iraqi would be cool with that.

Our country is run by Mr. Bubbles, but his running mate is Rubber Dickie. 

Ironically, there are no Shiites or Kurds in Iraq's Baath Party, but there are Sunni Arabs. 

Sunni is another sect with a name that linguistically rings of positive connotations. Sunni, sunshine, warmth...

I wonder if the little Sunni kids have their own version of Sesame Street with their own Big Bird and maybe Mr. Snuffleupagus is a camel. 

Maybe they would sing: "Sunni Days / sweeping the tanks away / on my way / to where the oil is sweet / can you tell me how to get / how to get to Liberty Street?"

Headline: In Our View: International student needs not being met
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
This is certainly a university.  And it is in Florida. But many international students wonder about the "International" in FIU.

Many have expressed concern about the caliber of service they receive from the university and organizations in place to support them, such as International Student Scholar Services. 

They feel that the organization simply does not cater to their needs.  They believe that workshops, held to educate them about the various regulations they must comply with, simply are not available often enough, or at times that suit them.  

Hosting as many as 200 students per workshop, the necessary personal attention required simply is not there. This could be solved simply by holding more of the mandatory workshops.

Counselors, students feel, are neither helpful nor courteous.

There should be more counselors available, so that an appointment is not required to answer simple questions.

International students cannot work jobs that are not on campus, and many have found that even the on-campus jobs are often occupied by instate students, leaving them out in the cold. Job-seeking services should be in place to help international students obtain employment.

There is a lack of scholarships expressly for international students, especially at the undergraduate level.  SGA sponsors the lone scholarship available, a scholarship that pays a measly $500. It goes without saying that there should be more scholarships available. 

Add to this the exorbitant tuition they must pay, $399.23, nearly five times what an instate undergraduate student would pay, and you're starting to get the picture. 

Life for international students is not easy.

The university fails to live up to its name.  International students constitute a 10th of the student body, on a campus located in one of the most international cities in the United States. 

The university should strive to improve its accessibility and service to the international community upon which it prides itself.

So what is so international about Florida International University? The answer is, simply, not much.

Headline: Defense stops offense 18-16 in Blue/Gold scrimmage
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU Community Stadium was empty at 7:30 Saturday morning prior to the Golden Panthers' final scrimmage of the spring except for one determined player. After becoming upset with his performance at Friday's afternoon practice, placekicker Adam Moss decided to take some extra repetitions.

The extensive effort paid the Coral Springs native dividends as he went 3-4 on field goals, which included a long of 53 yards, and a perfect 1-1 on point after attempts. Moss, who struggled at times last season, almost single handedly kept the FIU offense in the game after it squandered numerous opportunities inside the red zone. 

"That is what I have been working on all spring, so it felt really good," said Moss, whose only miss was from 30 yards, his shortest field goal attempt of the day. "I am more relaxed because you are pretty much used to everything now, and physically, I am a lot stronger than when I came in."

Despite Moss' efforts, the Golden Panthers' defense prevailed 18-16 as it set the tempo early - forcing two punts to begin the scrimmage. 

Although Head Coach Don Strock has implemented a new defensive 
scheme, the 3-4, their two other formations (4-3 and CAT/5 man line) were used a number of times as well. 

"I want to be able to mix in all of them in a game situation," said Strock, who is pleased with his team's progress at the conclusion of the spring, "and we did that."

Although they had the football moved on them, the Golden Panther defense was able to bear down in the red zone - forcing a fumble and several mental mistakes from an offense that accumulated 184 yards rushing on 44 carries. 

"I thought the defense should have come out hard, like we did," said defensive end Payton Williams. "The offensive line has improved and our run stopping is coming along." 

Williams recorded four tackles and a sack, while safety John Haritan led the way with nine tackles. 

Offensively, the Panthers improved their performance from last week's scrimmage, nearly doubling their passing totals. Backup quarterbacks Josh Padrick and David Tabor combined to go 28-45 through the air. Starter Jamie Burke remains sidelined nursing his surgically-repaired shoulder. 

"We had some excellent plays and then we made some errors that stopped drives," said Strock, who is not too concerned with the offense's inability to score inside the 20 yard line. "The defense had something to do with it, but we had some new plays we put in this week that we wanted to make sure we got on film. These are the kind of things that spring is for."

Tabor, who completed 65 percent of his passes, capped off the scrimmage by engineering the offense's only touchdown on the day's final series. The sophomore began the drive by completing his first three pass attempts before O.J. Price took three straight handoffs - punching in the third from six yards out. 

"We just did what we did the whole scrimmage: ran the ball, ran the ball and picked our spots throwing it," said Tabor. "It just seemed as if the defense wore down a little bit there at the end, we ran 80-90 plays, that's a lot of plays."

Price and Tori Robinson led the Panthers with 10 carries each, gaining 61 and 52 yards respectively.

Lundstedt and Weaver Suspended

University of Miami transfer Jermell Weaver has not been allowed to partake in spring drills as a result of his academic ineligibility. Weaver, who transferred to FIU as a junior, has not met the University's policy that states that all athletes must maintain a 2.0 grade point average, as opposed to the NCAA's requirement of 1.6.

"He's not that far off," Strock said. 

Tailback Jerrid Lundstedt was prohibited from participating in FIU's final scrimmage because of a violation of team rules which was not specified. by Strock or the universtity athletic department. He did, however play in last week's scrimmage, gaining 37 yards on nine carries.

Subheadline: Awilda I. Castro Suárez

&nbsp;

La guerra contra Irak será recordada por los vaivenes en las razones por las cuales se decidió entrar en este conflicto. Primero, se plantearon razones de seguridad nacional, ya que se sospechaba que Irak estaba construyendo armas biológicas y químicas. El gobierno de George W. Bush se agarró a esta tabla de salvación como náufrago para justificar ante el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas una intervención militar.

Estados Unidos no recibió amplio apoyo de la ONU y formó una supuesta coalición, a fuerza de repartir préstamos y ayudas económicas. Según avanzaban las tropas norteamericanas por territorio iraquí, las armas biológicas no aparecían. El discurso de la guerra contra el terrorismo daba sus últimos estertores.

Entonces tuvieron que montar un discurso lo suficientemente patriótico para asegurarse la simpatía de las masas. Ahora había que liberar al pueblo de Irak del yugo opresor. Este discurso tuvo su mejor actuación con los tanques de guerra estadounidenses tumbando una estatua de Saddam Hussein y los iraquíes saltando de alegría sobre la cabeza del que había sido, hasta hace unos días, su líder. 

El simbolismo de la estatua impregnó los titulares de prensa. Se anunció que el régimen había caído pero que aún quedaba mucho por hacer, la guerra continuaba. Resulta muy interesante que los pueblos oprimidos, muertos de hambre y necesidad, se liberen destruyendo estatuas. Mientras, la vista pasa de largo ante cientos de hospitales que no tienen servicio eléctrico, medicinas ni anestesia para tratar a los heridos. No han movilizado esfuerzos significativos para dar agua y alimento al pueblo que dicen liberar. 

Parece que de ahora en adelante las guerras van a ser al estilo "Minority Report", esa película hollywoodense en que los arrestos se hacen cuando los criminales piensan sus fechorías. Después de esta, la Guerra de las Mil Razones, los conflictos se van a conocer "A.G.P" y "D.G.P.": antes de las guerras preventivas y después de ellas.

Headline: Stories for Tough Times
Subheadline:  
Author: donquijote1111@yahoo.com
&nbsp;
HOW POLITICS WORKS 

(This little, tiny story is part of a series, in which I explain to my little daughter how things work.) 

Politics works like this: Big People of Big Country buy Big People of Little Country, who, by the way, will be elected in "democratic elections" thanks to big bucks; Big People of Big Country give big loans to Little Country (of course, to buy "made in Big Country"); Big People of Little Country pocket a big chunk, without ever investing in real development (education, health, the environment, etc); Little People of Little Country work for ever to pay back what they never got; Big People of Little Country thank Big People of Big Country in the name of Little Country, and promise to repay the big debt; and Little People of Little Country get big promises, just like Little People of Big Country. And they lived happily ever after... 

HOW THE LAW WORKS... FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LION 

(This is part of a series of POLITICALLY CORRECT stories for little children, who otherwise may not be ready to live in the Jungle.) 

One day the King of the Jungle, tired of being called a "Tyrant," gathered the most cunning animals in the kingdom, chief among them the Foxes... He said to them: "It's mighty unjust that I am not recognized for what I am. You know full well that the best of my leftovers, if any, go to the Little Animals... Well, I want you to write LAWS, so from now on it'll be them, and not me, who would rule over this God chosen kingdom..." 

After a few months of hard deliberations (and a few "private parties" and expensive trips) the Foxes (now turned politicians) returned with a long, long book of laws written in a language so hard to understand to the Little Animals that they thought it was old Greek. After translation, it started like this: "The animals with a mane will be treated like kings; the animals with paws and teeth will be above the Laws; and the animals who will represent the interests of the Little Animals, us, will be granted a raise in benefits and status... Of course, ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION will be considered ILLEGAL, and will result in the Lion eating the Little Animal..." 

THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE 

Once upon a time, in the deep jungle, lived a Lion and a Monkey... One day the Monkey, tired of the Lion always getting the lion share, and seeing that such injustice represented a danger to all the species of the jungle, demanded justice... The Lion, yawning and stretching, said: "You would have to have paws and sharp teeth..." Then the Monkey, who was very clever, devised a plan: He would go to the costume store, and look like a lion... 

When the Lion saw him, noticing that the new lion wasn't a match for him, and fearing competion, killed him on the spot... before the indifferent look of the little animals of the jungle... And that's how the Law of the Jungle was re-established one more time... 

NOTE: Other monkeys survived him... 

THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE II 

After killing the monkey dressed as a lion, the Lion gathered all the little animals of the jungle and announced: "Today we have successfully erradicated one of the major threats to the peace and order of our jungle... Yes, a new lion, probably envious of us, attacked without warning... Luckily --because you know how good is suffering for the spirit-- your sacrifice gave me strong paws and teeth... And yes, these mighty weapons were so useful to me that I finished him off without a sweat... Anyways, now it turns out that some other of his accomplices are roaming around and trying to attack us... So get ready for more suffering and restrictions, if not for a catastrophe... But, of course, there's a place for you in heaven..." 

Meanwhile, one of the little animals --who had been grazing all along-- asked another: "What did he say?" "I think he said something about a new lion," answered the other. To which the first animal replied: "Another one!?" 

HOW THE LION BENEFITS FROM THE LITTLE ANIMALS' POVERTY 

One day all the little animals went up to the King of the Jungle and complained about their poverty, and in particular about the fact that every time, during the dry season, they had to travel long distances to drink the precious fluid, and demanded a water well be built for them... They cited how the resources that they contributed to the kingdom were wasted in wars and fancy projects to the tastes of the King... He, however, replied with all kinds of excuses: the lack of resources, that it wasn't a matter of him not wanting it, but that it was a matter of priorities --which was one of his favorite words... 

Meanwhile, an Owl --who had very good eyes-- had been observing life in the jungle, and thought this way: "Every time there's a dry season the little animals must come to the little dirty water hole where the Lion waits for them... Had they been well fed and strong, he would have had to run after them and even risk resistance..." 

And that's how the Owl landed an important --and well paid-- post in the brand new Astronomy Department created by the King of the Jungle... to the effect of exploring life in other planets... 

A ROAD TO FREEDOM (UNLIKE RUSSIA'S) 

Why not build a new system? That offers PROSPERITY, SOCIAL JUSTICE and FREEDOM; that discards the defects of both Communism and Capitalism; and that places the system at the service of the human being, and not the other way around. Why not HUMANISM? 

Naturally, education and health care should be the maximum priorities; they should be free -or affordable, in the case of higher education- and accessible to all. Education should emphasize the learning of English -or Esperanto, if we all ever agree on it- and literacy... in computers. Likewise, culture and sports should receive special attention (for example, adopting the affordable child-care centers; in general, we would have much to learn from the Scandinavian model). A MIXED MODEL, that includes competition and cooperation, would create a healthy competition, and it would allow to satisfy the material and human needs of all. (In this way, the cooperative enterprises would be forced to become more efficient, while capitalist enterprises would be forced to become more humane; we would have much to learn from the Israeli kibbutz [non-profit cooperatives]; and from the industrial cooperatives of Mondragon, in the Basque Country [a "workers capitalism"].) We should seek full employment (for instance, by creating jobs in the construction of the transportation infrastructure; but, if unemployment persists, the work time could be reduced). Public transportation should be A1. (The city of Curitiba, in Brazil, offers us a functional model of transportation; bicycle lanes should be implemented along all major streets.) The homeless, who now occupy our better parks, should be incorporated into light but necessary duties, like picking up litter, in exchange for a decent wage; there should be no homeless. (Again, Curitiba is a model on this.) Junk food should have a warning label (just like cigarettes), particularly the one destined to children, and also be taxed to subsidize healthy alternatives. Housing should be available at popular prices. (Prefabricated multifamily units can help accomplish this; the movement of "new urbanism" can provide them with a sense of community and quality of life, say by having abundant green areas.) Public corruption should be treated as "public enemy No.1." TV and radio should be independent of Big Business and the State. (This is due to two reasons: culturally, because the ratings make bad programs become "good"... for business; and, politically, because whoever has power over the media... will be in power; however, people should be able to watch anything on video and cable; the BBC offers us and example of an independent media.) The "Free Press" should be democratized, so that, among other things, the censorship of the opinions of the public is eradicated. Politics should become cheaper to avoid its control by powerful groups (for example, offering free time on TV to the candidates; we would have much to learn from the political model of Switzerland [in particular, its political decentralization and its system of referendums]). Nevertheless, we should never follow neither anything nor anyone -including myself- blindly. And, of course, everything can be improved. Something to think about: While the prohibition of drugs has been largely ineffective, different studies show us alternative methods to face that problem -and the crime associated with them... The final form of this system would be determined by the acceptance of the people themselves: Each and everyone of these proposals should be submitted to referendum. And, the basis of everything else: We should learn to live, not FROM, but WITH Nature. 

"What worries me is not the violence of the few, but the indifference of the many" 

"Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time; the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence" 

-M.L. King 

A COMMENT FROM A FRIEND: 

The system you describe sounds awfully good. I'd say no country is on the road you suggest, but it might be a good thing for world leaders to read your article, since it could give them some goals. What a wonder it'd be, for example, if George Bush announced some actual long-term goals for the country, instead of reacting to events in a knee-jerk fashion. I'm picking on George, but much the same can be said of most any world leader I know of.

Dear Sir/Madam,

A friend of mine is taking the ENC 1101 mandatory course on the summer term and she almost dropped dead when the packet composed of 27 pages of a ring "book" and a CD was priced at $106.70, which came up to a $114.17 value when the tax was added.  There was an email sent to all the students in the class advising that they must have the complete package before showing up to class or they wouldn't be allowed to take the course.  Everything looked like a normal overpriced textbook problem, but the company that publishes the packet is Circles Learning, Inc. based in Miami, Fl and formed by three English teachers from FIU.  It is known that 1101 is mandatory for all students that attend college, so the volume of packets sold must be pretty large especially when they make mandatory the purchase of it.  I thank you for your time and discretion regarding this matter.

Headline: Diet pills containing Ephedra pose danger
Author: By Amber Lattimer and Sarah Rodriguez/ Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Since the recent death of Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler, nationwide concern about the adverse effects of dietary supplements containing Ephedra has been on the rise.  

Bechler's death is partially attributed to his use of Xenadrine, a dietary supplement containing the chemical Ephedrine. And surveys show Ephedra-based supplement use is on the rise among college students.

Ephedra is a natural derivative of the Chinese herb Ma Huang, which has Ephedrine as its main ingredient.  According to the Food and Drug Administration, products containing natural Ephedrine alkaloids have been used for a long time in traditional Chinese medicine but have been used more recently to promote weight loss, increase energy and boost athletic performance.

According to the Journal of American College Health, researchers have found that college students are using these supplements with greater frequency than older adults are. Nearly half of the students surveyed said they had used at least one dietary supplement in the past year, compared with 10 - 20 percent of adults in similar surveys.

The most common effects of taking diet pills containing Ephedra are an increase in metabolic rate, increased heart rate and the tightening of blood vessels, which restricts blood flow.  

"The increase in metabolic and heart rates and vassal constriction will probably be tolerated by someone with no preexisting underlying conditions," said Dr. Kathleen Goodman of the Femwell Group Health Comprehensive Womens' Health Care Center.  "However, how does one know they don't have an underlying condition, especially if they don't get checked out by a doctor first?" 

Some of the other side effects associated with Ephedra are insomnia, tremors, agitation, heart palpitations and nervousness.  FDA case studies indicate that more serious effects include stroke, heart attack, seizure and even death.  

In addition, the FDA points out that the risks increase when Ephedra is used during strenuous exercise, when mixed with other stimulants such as caffeine and when taken in higher dosages.  

Brenda Popritkin, coach of FIU's dance team, the Dazzlers, said that while she is unaware of any of the girls on the team using these supplements, she has friends who have used them.

"I do have friends who have taken those kinds of pills and have had good results," said Popritkin. "Others have had a fast heart beat and nervousness."

An FIU student who took an Ephedra supplement called Metabolife said she suffered from many side effects while she was on it and for some time after.

"I wasn't able to talk.  I was talking too fast," said Mary Shoma, a public relations major.  "I ran out of breath, and was on very bad mood swings.  [It got] to the point where my chest hurt and I was scared [because] it hurt even after I quit."

According to Goodman, there is no way of knowing exactly how much Ephedra a diet pill contains because the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate the pills. 

"The FDA does not have control over the concentration of Ephedra in these over-the-counter pills; there is absolutely no form of standard regulations so you have no idea what you're getting," Goodman said.	

Still, many people purchase the supplements regardless of the potential risks involved.  Studies from the Journal of American College Health show that only about 10 percent of the students who reported taking supplements acquired information about their use from a healthcare practitioner.  And just 41 percent who visited a doctor told him or her about their supplement use.

"I know people don't even go to the doctor to see if they are allergic to any of it," Shoma said.  "[This is] usually because they know someone who knows someone who they heard lost weight.  They aren't even certain of what they are taking."	

Last year's National College Health Assessment shows that 5.8 percent of FIU students surveyed are taking or have taken dietary supplements to lose weight.  

Popritkin says that students might take these supplements in response to societal messages that place an emphasis on being thin.  

"It is tough for young students to deal with the pressures of living here in Miami where most people are very body conscious and strive to look their best," said Popritkin.  "I think a lot of people resort to these pills because of the 'lose weight fast' propaganda.  Young students try it because of all of the advertising to promise you fast results in little time with no effort."

Shoma agrees that students feel pressure to be thin, but says people also lack discipline.

"People want something right away and they don't have to exercise this way," said Shoma. "See, I know what one should do to be healthy.  I just don't do it." 

Diet pill usage is especially high among college athletes trying to make it to the professional level.  According to a survey done by the National Collegiate Athletic Association involving 21,225 students at 713 institutions, the use of herbal Ephedra and anabolic steroid dietary supplements has increased among college students in the past four years. Various kinds of dietary supplement use were reported to encompass 42 percent of college athletes.

According to Mike Pawlusiak, head baseball trainer at FIU, college-level athletes might be tempted to use the drugs in an attempt to further their chances of playing professionally.

"At the college level the athletes are trying to get to the next level," said Pawlusiak.  "They may see professional players taking such substances, or feel that taking the performance-enhancing substances will help them get to that level."

Many manufacturers in the supplement industry promise that their products offer rapid results and a boost in athletic performance, thus appealing to people who seek immediate results.

"It's a way to get into shape quicker," said FIU's head baseball coach Danny Price. If a player starts a season out-of-shape and wants to get quick results, like the Orioles player who died, [Steve Bechler], he might be tempted to take the pills."

Price commented that he did not know of any usage of the fat-burning pills on his team.  Still, he hopes that students will heed the emerging warnings of the dangers of fat-burning pills with Ephedra, regardless of the potential benefits.

"I've never known of any players who have taken the pills, but that's something you can't test for every day.  I have to trust that my players will use their good judgment," Price said.  "I hope just because the pills are over-the-counter students won't assume they are safe." 

He makes it a point to educate his players about the dangers of Ephedra, considering that it is a substance widely available without a prescription.

"At the beginning of the season we sit the players down and go through all banned and dangerous substances," said Price.  "We're always available and encourage questions about supplements.  We also do random drug testing for the safety of our players."

While many may find that the results of taking the pills are the ones that they initially desired, there are other ways to get fit.

"Instead, I encourage healthy eating habits and lots of water," said Coach Popritkin.  

Shoma suggested that people find parking spots further away, take vitamins and include a lot of movement in their lives.

"Don't call it exercise," said Shoma.  "Call it action."

Questions about the risks associated with dietary supplements containing Ephedra continue to be raised nationwide.  Health care professionals and the FDA urge people who want to lose weight to consider the potential health risks associated with these pills and most importantly, to seek advice from a doctor.

"Bottom line, if you absolutely feel you must take a diet pill to lose weight, please, at least go see your doctor and be informed about the potentially dangerous side effects," said Goodman. "The pills can definitely help with short-term weight loss in absolutely healthy individuals, but they carry a risk."

Headline: New director of state relations appointed to help FIU lobby for funds
Author: Geannina Munizaga/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
To help the university lobby for funding and other issues, FIU alumnus Anitere Flores was recently appointed Director of State Relations at FIU.
"I found out about the job opening when I came down from [University of Florida] and decided to apply," Flores said. "I'm here now, and, so far so good."
The announcement was made March 25 in a press release sent by FIU's Integrated Media Group, which is part of the Office of Media Relations in University Park. Flores will serve as "a liaison between the Legislature and the university in order to promote the interests of students, faculty and alumni," the press release read. 
"Right now I don't feel like I'm ready to practice law yet," Flores said. "So I feel my time would be better spent helping out my alma mater."
According to Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, the university has one full-time lobbyist, one full-time policy adviser, and two part-time lobbyists consistently fighting for FIU during the legislative session.
"[Our lobbyists] are where they need to be, when they need to be there," Rosenberg said. 
Flores received her BA in political science and international relations from FIU by the age of 21 and went on to the University of Florida to earn a law degree. 
While attending law school, she took an internship with the House of Representatives in Tallahassee. Additionally, Flores spent one year working at the House Education Committee and served as policy chief for education issues under Governor Jeb Bush.
"When you're dealing with education, it's an issue that everyone supports," Flores said. "Working for Bush gave me another perspective about the education system and interning in Tallahassee re-sparked my love for politics."
Flores, who graduated in 1997, was impressed with the growth of FIU and found the university to be 'light years ahead' compared to other universities on her return from law school.
"Being an alumni makes my job a lot easier," Flores said. "I have no problem selling the university to legislators and I feel like I'm really able to make a difference."
Already, Flores is making her mark in Tallahassee among administration.
"FIU reflects the community's hopes, dreams and aspirations of people wanting a better professional life," Stephen Sauls, vice provost for Governmental Relations at FIU, said. "Flores is the embodiment of that dream."
Jessica Morffi, University Park Student Government Council president, believes Flores brings a special perspective to the job.
"She has a good background of what FIU has been and where it is going," Morffi said. "She's also young and student friendly. She still remembers what it's like to be a student and pay for school."
Although most of her time has been spent in Tallahassee, Flores wants to have a more personal relationship with FIU's student body, on both the graduate and undergraduate levels.
"One of my goals is to involve and educate students a lot more," Flores said. "Students have very little idea how much what is decided in legislation affects them."

Author: Jennifer Camille/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The inaugural Chris Gray Memorial Lecture, honoring the late professor and mentor, was held on April 11 at the Kovens Conference Center at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

"He was a great man," said Colleen Vasconcellos, former graduate student of Dr. Gray, and Ph.D candidate of history, "it is a shame he had to leave this Earth so soon, I was his teaching assistant my first year at FIU. He was a professor, an activist, a humanitarian... he was everything." 

Those who knew Gray continue to praise him as an academic as well as a loved one and colleague.

"I want to be like Chris Gray the colleague, who never said a negative word about his fellow department members," John Clark, associate professor of international relations, said.

Gray began teaching at FIU in 1995. He earned his Ph.D. at Indiana University in African history, and served in the Peace Corps in Senegal and Gabon. He was also an active Amnesty International member and a frequent participant in the activities of the African New-World Studies program. In 1991, Gray received a grant from the Fulbright-Hays program to conduct research in Gabon. He met his wife Kisanga there, who is originally from Zaire.

Gray's legacy lives on in those who knew him.

"Dr. Chris Gray was truly everything," James Sweet, assistant professor of history, said. "His love for Africa was strong, genuine and continuous." 

Florence Bernault, from the University of Wisconsin and one of the leading young historians of Central Africa in the U.S, was the chosen speaker for the Memorial Lecture, speaking extensively about Gray's great contribution to her work and the shifting of colonial Gabon, according to Sweet.

Gray finished an important book titled "Colonial Rule and Crisis in Equatorial Africa," Clark said, which was published in 2002 by Rochester University Press. His former dissertation advisor, Phyllis Martin, at Indiana University did the final revisions after his death. Gray was also the driving force behind the creation of a M.A. program in the ANWS program. 

In December 1998, Gray was diagnosed with cancer. He died Oct. 16, 2000 in his Miami home. He is survived by his wife and his three children. 

Those who did not know Gray personally also express their feelings about him.

"I did not know Dr. Chris Gray, but from what I have heard he was deeply passionate about Africa, loved his students a lot and had a genuine love for human rights," Rosa Henriquez, ANWS secretary, said.

A plaque was placed at University Park by Ted Young, associate director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center, on the gazebo near Deuxieme Maison, by the lake. 

In this way, FIU holds part of Gray's memories and living words that read, "In Memory of Dr. Christopher Gray, 1958-2000, Professor of African History," with the words from his book: "The Clan Knows No Boundary . . ." 

Plans to raise funds for the Chris Gray Memorial Endowment Scholarship have begun, and donations from the lecture will go toward it.

"The Chris Gray Memorial Endowment Scholarship began immediately after his death. The fellowship is not endowed until it reaches $15,000," said Clark, "it only has about $4,000 in it now and we have until October of 2005 to reach the endowment goal." 

Faculty is hoping to hold more annual lectures in honor of Gray, as well as promotion for the endowment scholarship.

Headline: Freshman mentorship program in works
Author: John Morris/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council has proposed plans for a new mentoring program for next year to help incoming freshmen and transfer students get more easily acquainted with the school. 

This new program intends to familiarize the students with BBC more quickly and thoroughly.

"Freshmen and transfer students are unfamiliar with how FIU works," said Adrian Carter, BBC-SGC president.  "There are two goals for this program. The first objective is this program would build a network in communication between students.  The second objective is it would make students feel more important in the flow of the school.  This program would create a more knowledgeable student body, and can make upper classmen out to be role models."

The program is currently in its early stages.  Student government is trying to get the word to the administration in the hopes of gaining support.

"I think it's a wonderful idea," Campus Life and Orientation Associate Director David Cole said. "Mentorship will allow students to get acquainted easier with other students.  There are things they'll get out of this that they can't get at orientation or freshman experience because there's more one-on-one interaction." 

The idea was originally proposed by Nicolette White, former BBC-SGC representative at-large, last year.  It was later adopted by the council, and plans are now underway to make it come alive.  White is in a study abroad program this semester and was not available for comment.  

"This program is like a big brother/big sister program," Carter said. "This program will be beneficial to new students who don't understand how the university works."

"The idea is to pair juniors and seniors with new students," Carter added. "The program is not completely ready yet, but when it is, more information will be announced. If this program is passed, the next goal will be to make students aware of this service."

Many students agree with this new proposal for a mentorship program.

"I wish I had a mentor when I first came.  Then maybe I wouldn't have done as many mistakes.  They would've put a lot of sense into my head," freshman Juniole Justilien said.

"I wouldn't join the program, but I know that others would, and I think it's a good idea for new students," junior John Herring said.

It is unknown at this point where the funding will come from and how much it will cost, but this will not affect students' costs, according to Carter.  

"There are many places in SGA where funding can come from, and we are uncertain where the funding will come from at this time.  This issue hasn't been worked out yet," Carter said.

Final details for this program are still sketchy, but if the administration approves it, future BBC students could be getting mentors later this year.

Headline: Sigma Alpha Mu auction raises more than $1000 for charity
Author: Adriana Oliva/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A down and dirty performance and rendition of Christina Aguilera's "Dirrty" set the rowdy, sexy and exotic tone on April 10 in Gracie's Grill, where 18 of the most eligible Sammy men were auctioned off. 

"Gracie's rocked and grooved as it never has before," host and Sammy member Josmanny Horta said.

The ladies were certainly "moving," each one trying to outbid the other, as they tried to win themselves one of these Sammy men and a trip on a five-hour cruise set to sail April 26.

Auctioned bachelors didn't stay far behind in the moving and shaking department. 

They had to work the stage and rock their bodies to get their bids. Most of them even engaged in a small striptease show, by the request of the ladies in the crowd. 

"I did it for the philanthropy and for the fraternity, and luckily I did not have to take off my clothes," sophomore Jaime Matus said. Matus, even with his clothes on, did quite well, being sold at $135, one of the highest bids of the evening.

Introducing every eligible brother being bid on, Horta, who was also one of the bachelors on the menu, and Eli Rodriguez co-hosted the evening. 

Despite some technical difficulties with the microphone, Horta and Rodriguez managed to grill the brothers, asking some intriguing questions that the guys could not avoid.

"So Leo De Silva, we know you just won representative at-large. Explain to us how you truly are a rep. at-'large?'" Horta asked.

Proceeds from the event went to the Elizabeth Glasier Pediatrics Aids Foundation. 

Aside from the money collected from the bids, money was also raised from the sale of calendars and beer. One dollar from each $2 beer went to the charity. 

"The calendars are very hot. Fourteen out of the 18 auctioned brothers pose in the calendar," event coordinator Gus Bello said. Bello was the creator and brains behind the event.

The calendars are still being sold. For this reason, the total amount of money raised has not been revealed yet.

The highest bid of the evening went to Sammy member Will Morales, who was sold for $180. 

Horta and Bello both told The Beacon that more than $1,000 was raised from the event alone.

Headline: Program allows ROTC cadets to finish studies before deploying
Author: Felicidad Garcia / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
War is no deterrent to the FIU students currently enlisted in the Army as part of the Reserve Officers Training Corps program. ROTC cadets in the military's Simultaneous Membership Program are pursuing their degrees while continuing their training as soldiers. 

SMP is partly a program, partly a contract, in which ROTC cadets, who are at least juniors, are active soldiers in the Army but are also completing their post-graduate studies before leaving civilian life altogether.

Miguel Santana, a junior and a Military Science III cadet, is one such student.  He said if he is sent to war after graduation, he will follow his duty to protect his country without hesitation. 

"As a student, as a soldier and as a citizen, I'm going to do what I feel I must do in order to protect the Constitution, which also means following the chain of command," Santana said.

Santana was an active member of the army for eight years and later an employee for AT & T Broadband as a capitol budget analyst. He has a wife and family, and yet, with all his accomplishments, he admitted feeling unfulfilled in today's civilian workforce after being in the army. Santana returned to school, and after earning an associate's degree at Miami-Dade Community College, he decided that continuing on to a bachelor's at FIU and joining the ROTC program was the way to go. 

Santana and many others in the ROTC program are return soldiers; men and women who have served in the armed forces in the past, but have decided that they would be better served with a degree under their belts.

Santana said the events of Sept. 11 most motivated him to re-enlist in the Army.

"After Sep. 11, I realized I wanted to make a difference," he said. "I'm not here to change the world, but by enlisting myself into the military again, I knew I could make a difference." 

Lt. Col. Francisco Ascorbe, battalion commander and professor of military science, understands the apprehension that many of the cadets may feel about possibly entering a war.

"There is a certain level of anxiety about this particular situation that we're in and it might affect them a little bit more," Ascorbe said. "They may be thinking about it a little bit more, because they know that in two or three years it may be them out there. But that's what they want to do."

For many cadets, a contracted program in ROTC exempts enlisted juniors and seniors from entering active duty right away. This means that should their unit be deployed by a presidential or partial call-up, these students will remain in school until after graduation.

Ascorbe is a native of Puerto Rico, attended the University of Dayton in Ohio, and after graduating through its ROTC program was an active member of the army for 17 years. 

Ascorbe traveled to many places as part of the army, including Panama, Peru and Saudi Arabia. 

He met his wife while stationed in Panama as an infantry soldier and paratrooper. 

In Peru, his courage was tested in the face of the dominant guerilla terrorist group of the time which was called Tupac Amaru after an Inca leader. 

"Everywhere we'd go we were in buses with people protecting us and they used to house us in different hotels all the time," Ascorbe said of his experience in Peru. "You had to take certain precautions to avoid an incident. You get a bit of a taste of what it would be were we to be in a really tough situation." 

As a professor and mentor to approximately 100 cadets in the ROTC program, Ascorbe said that he and his staff have explained the realities of the profession that the students have chosen, and it is part of their training.

"On a day-to-day basis, there are times when we are faced with fear or anxiety," Thomas McCrary, senior and MS VI cadet, said. "I mean, in my unit they're deploying now, some of them are gone. So when it's in your face like that, there is some [anxiety], but we all knew the risk when we signed up." 

McCrary is also under simultaneous service contract. His graduation date is closing in on him, and he is completely aware of what lies ahead. 

Like Santana, he was also an active member of the Armed Forces prior to enrollment at FIU and decided to obtain early leave from service after two years in order to receive an education at FIU. 

Upon graduation, McCrary has already been appointed to a position as a part of the Military Intelligence unit. He said that were he not contracted with the ROTC program at FIU he would have probably been sent overseas along with others in his unit.

But for McCrary and other students under contract, that transition will have to wait until after graduation. Until then, they will remain focused on school and stay tuned in to the news. 

"It is everyone's responsibility to keep up to date about what's going on as far as current events," Santana said. "To be a good citizen of this or any country you have to keep informed because if not, you can't see what's going on in the big picture."

Headline: New parking garages under construction
Author: Asra Jawaid/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The construction of two, brand-new parking garages at the University Park campus is scheduled to begin this month, according to Robert Griffith, acting director of the department of Facilities Management.

These two new garages will be six stories high; that's one floor more than the Blue and Gold parking garages located near the Graham Center and Charles E. Perry building.

This extra story allows them to hold 1,400 cars, instead of 1,000 cars, the amount the current garages can contain.

"Administration officials want to be able to allow for the growth the university feels it's going to experience," said Bill Foster, director of Parking and Traffic. 

A study done by FIU's Parking and Traffic Advisory Committee about three years ago shows that there is a need for more garages.

"The demand is clearly there; we have studies showing this," said Griffith. "Also, we're expanding the campus and [Tamiami] Park won't allow us to park on their land." 

The project should be completed by June of 2004, said Alberto Delgado, a senior project manager also in the Facilities Management department.

Students also see the need for better parking arrangements. 

"Parking is needed now, but considering that we're going to build new buildings for the law school and the Grant School for Business and also expand the Health and Life Sciences Building, we're going to need it even more," said Nakeetah Jenkins, a parking patroller who lives on campus.

The design of the two new garages, which have yet to be named, has been in the works for about a year, said Griffith. 

The use of additional lots will help eliminate possible inconveniences posed by the construction of the new garages, including narrowed lanes, closed roads and detours, said Foster.

 "During the construction of the garage across from the Center for Engineering and Computer Sciences, people can park in a temporary lot less than five minutes away," he said. This lot will contain 382 spaces. 

"While the other [garage] is being built," said Foster, "people can park in the lot near the football stadium." 

This lot is currently used only sparingly. Because of the distance between this lot and the rest of the school, FIU will provide bus service to and from the lot free-of-charge, he said.

The company in charge of building will be Pavarini Construction. 

"This'll be their first project at FIU. They'll probably make a bid on the recreation center in the next couple of months," said Griffith.

The recreation center to which Griffith refers to is scheduled to begin construction across from the Golden Panther Arena in the next few months.

In addition to the 1,400 parking spaces each garage will provide, one of them will come equipped with offices on the first floor, said Greg Burdine-Coakley, assistant director of Facilities Management and Operations.

At this office, people can pay a ticket, contest a ticket or buy a parking permit.

"Basically, just conduct business," Burdine-Coakley said.

Foster estimates the money required to complete the construction of these two buildings including piping, draining, sewage and a street to be built near the 8th Street entrance to the school to be at about $24 million.

All of this money will come from parking fees required of all students each semester. 

Currently, students are required to pay $81.96 in parking fees over the course of the fall and spring semesters. 

"By Florida state statute, [building garages] is the only thing that can be done with this money," Foster said. 

In general, current on-campus drivers are pleased with the news of the new garages. 

"This place is crowded and gets more crowded every year," said Christopher Davilla, sophomore, accounting. "As long as the parking fee doesn't go up too much, we need the garage."

The faculty feels similarly.

"I'd definitely use [the garage]. It just took me 10 minutes to find a parking spot out here," said John Zebra, a visiting instructor who routinely parks in the lot across from the Center for Engineering and Computer Sciences.

Others aren't as optimistic about the benefits of the new garages.

"I won't pay for parking [by paying the parking fee] or use the garage because there shouldn't be any need for me to. I'd just be supporting the bureaucracy," said Priscilla Ferguson, an adjunct professor in the Art and Art History department. 

She parks off campus.

"I don't think [the new garages] will make any difference," Jara Blum, junior, sociology, said.

Headline: Administrators concerned with proposed '03 - '04 budget
Author: Geannina Munizaga/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Florida legislature approved the individual budgets on April 15 that were proposed by the House of Representatives and Senate for state education funding for the 2003-2004 school year.

Budget cuts to FIU's funding, totaling $12.6 million in the House's proposal and $6.4 million in the Senate's proposal, have administrators worried about the future of FIU and anxiously awaiting the final budget proposal from legislation in Tallahassee, which is expected on May 2 at the earliest.

"Such severe cuts for universities this year are far greater than I have ever seen," Stephen Sauls, vice provost for Governmental Affairs, said.

According to the House's proposal, no funds for the construction of new university     spaces (estimated at $.79 million) and expected costs for enrollment growth (approximately $7.3 million) are given. However, the House's budget does calculate an anticipated $3.6 million from FIU's nonrecurring lottery dollars and an undergraduate tuition increase expected to cover $4.5 million.

Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs, sent a letter to the university community through FIU's website to address the present situation. 

"Now we look forward to the 2003-2004 year with the worst of both worlds, proposed deep budget cuts coupled with steep tuition increases for our students," the letter read. 

The Senate's budget proposal cut funds by $6.4 million, which, like the House's proposal, does not leave any funds for enrollment growth and expects additional funds from undergraduate tuition.

Additionally, the proposal allows for even further tuition increases for graduate and international students.

"The Senate and House are allowing a 7.5 percent tuition increase for all undergraduates," Anitere Flores, director of State Relations at FIU, said. "Even more, the Senate's proposal allows the tuition increase to reach 12.5 percent for graduates and international students."

With no decision made by legislation yet, FIU administrators are weighing priorities while they await final budget assessments.

"Cuts will not be across the board. Administration knows what their priorities are, and will try to protect them," said Rosenberg. "Deans and program directors are reviewing their budgets and around our priorities will we be making our decisions."

Main concerns include continuing to develop the Honors College, sustaining support for undergraduates in the form of financial aid and scholarships, maintaining and increasing doctoral degree production, preserving adequate and competitive salaries for university faculty and staff and continuing development of the student FIU's most pressing issue is to protect funding that is currently allocated in the budget, which includes the College of Law operating budget of $667,000, the College of Law building budget of $17 million and Public Education Capital Outlay funding (which is fully funded in the Senate's proposal, but not by the House).

Judith Blucker, executive vice provost for Academic Administration, expects significant changes to result from the proposal.

"If the proposed budget goes through ... we may be looking at fewer classes, fewer adjuncts, less services and a hiring freeze due to insufficient funds," Blucker said. 

In addition, financial aid would be significantly affected by budget cuts. The House requires the university to subsidize any tuition amount that exceeds the 7.5 percent increase that, according to the amount of FIU students on Bright Futures, comes out to an additional $.5 million that needs to be covered, Sauls said. 

"It's a very dismal outlook for next year," said Charles Tinder, associate vice president for Budget and Planning. "[Lobbyists] are having to argue just to keep what we have now. We really need people - students in particular - to communicate to the legislature."

With full-time lobbyists fighting for FIU in Tallahassee during the legislative session - who are, according to Rosenberg, "where they need to be, when they need to be there ... particularly during the last two weeks of legislation, which is the most critical time," - the battle is not over yet.

Monies that have been proposed by the House for PECO total $19.4 million. That includes $1 million for the Graduate School of Business office and classroom construction at UP, $1.35 million for the Marine Biology Department for science classrooms at BBC and $17 million for the College of Law Building.

The Senate's proposal exceeds the House's total funding by more than $8 million. Extra funds include $5 million for utilities and infrastructures for a chiller (an air conditioning system), and $3.13 million for a central utility plant sub-station. No funds are allocated for the Marine Biology science classrooms in the Senate's proposal. 

Moreover, the Senate has a non-funded amendment of approximately $1 billion that would provide extra money for state universities. FIU's portion of the amendment equals $7.25 million, according to Sauls.

"The Senate already provides $20 million more for FIU than the House bill," Sauls said. "Obviously, all of us want the final budget to be as close to the Senate's proposal as possible." 

Administration is anxiously awaiting final decisions and hopes legislation will not go into extra sessions while deciding on a compromise on the state budget.

"[The legislature] shouldn't be dismantling the university system because that would have short and long term consequences," said Sauls. "Having this university not only benefits individuals, but it helps create wealth for the community through its graduates."

Representatives from the House, Senate and governor's office met in Tallahassee early March for a 60-day session. Legislation is scheduled to break on May 2, when a final compromise on the state budget is expected to be reached.

Subheadline: International students say they struggle with high tuition, restraints and little help from FIU
Author: Tuere Allwood/  Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Mallory Pill-Taylor read the letter from the Admissions office carefully, becoming increasingly confused as to why they were dropping her classes.

She received a scholarship allowing her to pay in-state fees for 18 credits, as opposed to out-of-state fees.  She only used 12 of the credits the previous semester, with six remaining for which the scholarship waiver should be applied.  Still, in her hand was a letter threatening her student status.

Pill-Taylor, a visual arts major from Montego Bay, Jamaica, is one of a growing number of international students who say they are fed up with unnecessary rules that make it difficult to complete their education at FIU. 

By federal and state law, international students must comply with a number of policies, including the requirement to maintain full-time status, laws prohibiting students from working more than 20 hours per week, laws prohibiting international students from working off-campus, health insurance requirements, soaring out-of-state tuition, and post-graduation limitations.

If any rule is broken, international students run the risk of being sent back to their permanent place of residency.

"If I lose my classes, it's very unlikely that I would have gotten back in them, and then I'd be here for a year doing nothing, which I can't even do because then I'd fall out of status as an FIU student," Pill-Taylor said, whose problem was finally, after three weeks of intimidating letters from various offices, attributed to the university's failure to update the computer system.

Lagging updates to international students' records are a main problem that international students have with FIU offices and personnel.  International students say that because their status is quickly questioned, FIU should make it a priority to update their personal records right away so that students do not encounter problems that are no fault of their own, as in Pill-Taylor's case.

There is a need for each office at FIU to communicate with one another because once a situation is clarified with one office, students still have problems with a different office about the same situation, international students said.

Students also grumble that International Student and Scholar Services, which provides information and advising to the students, does not offer sufficient help or advise options for students, and personnel tend to be rude and unsympathetic to students' problems.

"We understand that most regulations are federal and state policy," said Shekera Smith, a finance major from Nassau, Bahamas. "However, ISSS should be primarily concerned with the student, while following these policies.  If the student has an emergency, it still takes forever to get an appointment."  

"And there are very few counselors who end up helping you," Smith added. "Instead of trying to work out a solution with the student, all they do is state the laws, which we already know, and tell us that either we find a way, or go home, and we are left to fend for ourselves.  I feel like every conversation ends with, 'follow the law or get sent home.'"

ISSS says that their primary concern is to maintain the status of the students.  With over 3,000 international students representing over 138 countries, advisers can only meet with students by appointment, ISSS said.

Still, international students maintain that if there is not enough staff to accommodate the problems of each student, FIU should hire more personnel to do so.  Students say that they need ISSS to understand that emergencies arise that do not allow time to wait on an appointment, and they need to feel as if the office is concerned.

According to ISSS, there are support options made available to international students, such as a club for international students and mandatory workshops that keep students informed.  But international students say that these services are no great help.

"The workshops provided by ISSS are not helpful because it is one person standing in front of 200 people, speaking Greek to us, because we don't understand the terms they use," Pill-Taylor said.  "And they are held in the middle of the week in the middle of the day, which is very inconvenient for those who have classes." 

But ISSS say they are not completely to blame.

"I, myself, am an international student," said graduate student Jesus Abastida, who works as a graduate assistant in the ISSS office.  

"What most international students don't realize is that the situation is up to them. Sometimes students don't want to follow a certain policy, and I don't think that ISSS is providing bad service by enforcing these policies."

In compliance with state and university law, failure to pay tuition in full and on time is a prime way for international students to "fall out of status."  International students say that they should be given a little leeway, because they pay, per credit, almost five times the amount that Florida residents pay for tuition.

In accord with the Tallahassee Board of Education, state universities charge international students significantly more than they do in-state students.  While in-state undergraduate fees run at $83.72 per credit, international undergraduates pay $399.23 per credit.

According to Chuck Tinder, assistant vice-president of Business and Finance at FIU, the state has allotted a tight budget for the upcoming year and so state universities will have to raise tuition.  The state gives FIU the freedom to go as high as it would like with the increase in international student fees, but, while the decision is not final, Tinder said tuition for international students would likely increase by no more than 7.5 percent.

Student government, while not being able to stop tuition increase for international students, says they plan to restrict it.

"We cannot stop tuition from increasing, but we can fight it from being excessive," said Clayton Solomon, University Park Student Government Council president-elect. "We are trying to make sure that international students do not pay more money for less service, as they did with last year's increase of 20 percent."

Students say FIU should offer many more scholarships, financial aid or tuition waivers to international students who achieve academic success in order to pay the rising tuition and fees.

"The funny thing about this school is that it is supposed to be Florida International University, but they don't do one thing to help the [international] students.  There are so many things that are an injustice to the international student," said Javan Hunt, international business and marketing major from Freeport, Grand Bahama.

According to Solomon, student government already sponsors scholarships for international students, but next year's plan is to have at least 10 percent of all scholarships earmarked for international students because approximately one of every 10 FIU students are international.

Student government is also working on a bus transportation system to take students to local malls and shopping centers, since most international students are housing residents and do not have cars, said Ron Hollis,  UP-SGC vice-president-elect.

"The buses have already been purchased, so it is going to happen," Hollis said.  "Even though insurance makes the project very expensive, the important part is that it is not going to cost students anything." 

In accordance with state and FIU policy, international students must also purchase an insurance plan that passes ISSS inspection.

With so many financial clauses, international students say that they should, at least, be able to work during their time at FIU. Yet, by federal and state law, international students can only work on-campus, and they say there are problems with this arrangement as well.

"If you are an American citizen, you can get a job anywhere, but [American citizens] get most of the on-campus jobs so it makes it hard for international students to get a job," Elton Cooper, an accountant major from Nassau, Bahamas said.  "Plus, the work-study students get a good amount of the available positions." 

International students say that just as there are certain jobs that cater to, but are not specifically for minorities or work-study students on campus, there should be on-campus jobs that pay particular attention to international students. Jobs are also a problem for international students upon graduation.  

According to ISSS, students must apply for Optional Practical Training in compliance with federal law, which allows them to work for one year in the United States while trying to change their status from non-resident aliens to permanent residents.  This, too, can be a difficult process.

Graduating students must apply for OPT, await approval, which takes an average of four months, during which international students may not work or leave the country without forfeiting their OPT.  Once they are approved for OPT, students have one year to find a company to sponsor them, if they have not already done so, allowing the graduate to remain in the United States to work and live as a legal resident for as long as they choose.

International students say that they understand that there are federal and state laws that must be followed, but they would benefit from having more understanding and support from FIU.

Headline: Ironic Management brings uncommon duo to screen
Author: Joe Martel, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Everybody gets angry from time to time. It's a part of life. What's important is that we find healthy, creative and, above all, non-destructive ways to express our anger. For example: if you channel it a certain way, you could end up directing a half-decent comedy flick staring Adam Sandler.

 I am, of course, referring to director Peter Segal (Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps) and his latest work, Anger Management. Although I wouldn't necessarily consider myself a big Sandler fan, I do like much of his work, and this movie is one of his better ones. Many of his roles are that of naïve individuals. In a sense, almost child-like, sometimes completely child-like, i.e. Billy Madison. Here, we see him as a mature and responsible adult.

New York City? It figures; where else in America are you going to go if your story is all about anger. A city with a population the size of several small countries combined, filled with people getting on each others nerves 24/7 is a great location choice. 

Dave Buznick (Sandler) is an exception to the rule. He never gets angry and he never fights back. As a result, he gets walked over more than 5th Avenue. His job is going nowhere, and his relationship with his girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei) is on the rocks. 

He won't even kiss her in public due to a traumatic childhood event. At every turn, there is a very good reason for him to blow his top, but he just lowers his head and walks away. 

All of a sudden, it happens. I don't know how it happens, but it happens. Dave gets arrested for assaulting a female flight attendant. 

Now, anyone with a lobotomy will tell you that he was innocent, but somehow the courts thought otherwise and, here enter the gods of irony. 

He was subsequently sentenced to anger management class. His instructor is Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) a total psychotic who is always getting in his face. Just when Dave thinks it can't get any worse, Buddy ends up moving in with him and nearly drives him insane. 

I found this movie to be humorous not just because of the jokes, the insults and other funny repartee, but because it made me feel somewhat angry myself. Every time Dave found himself in a demeaning or frustrating situation, I felt like jumping in and beating up everybody, including him, for not standing up for himself. 

That's the irony of it all: a movie about anger management that makes you angry watching it. This is what makes it worth watching. 

The celebrity guest appearances of both Roger Clemens of the NY Yankees and Rudy Giuliani were a nice touch also. It's incredible that they managed to get the former mayor of New York in an Adam Sandler film.

 Sandler gives a good performance, and, in my opinion, working alongside an accomplished veteran actor like Jack Nicholson is an excellent career move; one that may lead to more mature roles.

Cursive

The Ugly Organ

What can I say?  I'm a sucker for string instruments. Here's a band that is finally getting the recognition and popularity it deserves.  

Indie-rockers Cursive are starting to make a real name for themselves with their new album, The Ugly Organ.  A full-length follow up to 2000's Domestica.

One thing you'll notice right away is the cello, present on every track. The band first experimented with the string instrument on 2001's five-track EP, Burst and Bloom, when they picked up cellist Gretta Cohn. This has become a fixed element in Cursive's lineup and it distinguishes them as a band apart from others in the indie-emo rock scene.

While it may not be a completely perfect album, (with a few tiny flaws here and there) I have to be completely honest when I say that The Ugly Organ is indeed a perfect follow-up. It's full of trademarks; singer Tim Kasher's breathy voice and dark lyrical style, a sexy combination that compliments the seemingly sex-inspired lyrics throughout the album. The depressed motif also works incredibly well, even with songs that are more upbeat, just as it does on previous Cursive material.

These are all very typical of Cursive, making the album familiar and appealing to fans and newcomers alike. They've evolved as well by playing with some  abstract instrumentation such as organs, trombones, and bells; all working and blending together in beautiful harmony.

As I mentioned above, Cursive is known for their depressing and bitter attitude. This may be the one and only flaw, and it's miniscule. It turns The Ugly Organ into an album that makes me want to kill myself, very reminiscent of Sunny Day Real Estate's Diary. To be honest, it isn't necessarily a bad flaw, just a deterrent from constant or repeated listening. One can only take Kasher's sadness for so long.

Still, the album is worth more than one listen as it contains so much material to spend time with and analyze intimately. Its complexities show Cursive's true professionalism and unique talent. 3.5 out of 4 stars

Longwave

The Strangest Things

"I am everything you wanted," Steve Schiltz of Longwave sings to me in his low and powerful voice in the song "Tidal wave." 

At that moment, already seven cuts into the album, I have no qualms with him or the next line that he sings, "I am everything you need." Baby, I think I love you. 

Okay, just kidding. But seriously, Longwave has a great talent and they certainly don't hold back in their newest album The Strangest Things. This New York-based foursome brings back the wholesome qualities of pure rock to today's nu-metal pop culture. 

The Strangest Things is a catchy conglomeration of laid-back music that everyone (yes, even your mother) can totally rock to. The music is reminiscent to that of U2 and Joy Division, to name some of the older influences, as well as British shoe-gazing bands like Slowdive or Swervedriver. 

The good thing: it's a great trip into the past. Longwave has such a powerful command of their instruments and voices that you can hear it emanating from the holes in your speakers. The bad thing: at one point, my roommate asked me if I was listening to U2, that's how much Schiltz sounds like Bono at times. My suggestion: If you like do U2, you'll love Longwave's The Strangest Things and find it worth listening to. 3.5 out of 4 stars

The Walkmen

Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is Gone

On paper, the Walkmen sound like they might actually save our generation from the banality of repetitious "Zeta-rock" and the numerous samplings used in mainstream hip-hop from a better era of music, but unfortunately this is not the case.  

I tried to give Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is Gone a chance. I really did. So let's start with the good: Instrumentally speaking, the group is alright, especially the snare-ridden drumming done by Matt Barrick. The album feels very nostalgic, almost echoey, and the style of the group somewhat resembles Radiohead, which is hard for anyone to pull off (except Radiohead, of course).

 I like the addition of the piano in some tracks, and overall yes, the Walkmen are different, and it is nice to hear something different for a change, but after about four tracks, you want to drive your car into a wall. 

Perhaps this is due to the vocals of Paul Maroon. He may have a decent voice, but its hard to tell because when he sings he slurs all his words together as if he is drunk and tired. It just  seems put on.  

All in all, Everyone Who Pretended... was a boring listen. Maroon should definitely stick to the piano, and we might even actually have a decent band, sans his mediocre singing.1.5 out of 4 stars

Headline: 3-D 'Ghosts' journey spellbinding
Author: Krystal Alvarez, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Just when you thought you'd had enough of Titanic, here comes the 3-D Imax film "Ghost of the Abyss." Academy Award-winning director James Cameron travels deep into the Atlantic to explore one of the most breathtaking ships of all time: the Titanic.   The movie is a documentary which tapes the two-week exploration of the ship's remains.

Longtime actor Bill Paxton, along with a slew of historians and marine experts, tell the story of the sunken historical treasure. Using high-tech gear, this crew dives deep into the ocean unlocking some of the secrets of the ship's fatal voyage. 

With never before seen footage of the Titanic, "Ghost of the Abyss" takes the audience on a 3-D journey unlike any other.

I don't know about you, but I am only used to seeing 3-D at Disney World rides. I had never experienced a real 3-D movie until "Ghosts of the Abyss." Although the thought of watching a one-hour 3-D documentary about a voyage that killed 1,500 people did seem a little odd, the more I watched though, the more I understood why 3-D is necessary. 

Little details like bubbles that are released as they are diving deeper into the ocean, and the look of the water as it pushes against the glass of their MIR submersible, are not details one would notice in a normal movie. 

Yet with the 3-D effect every detail makes the audience feel as if they are part of the exploration. 

The cameras used for the movie were especially made for the voyage. They used a Reality Camera System, which withstands the ocean's pressure (6,000 pounds per square inch).  

There were also two Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) that were designed to dive into the interior of the Titanic. The ROVs were originally named Bot 1 and Bot 2 but then affectionately renamed Jake and Elwood.

They also brought a bit of comic relief to the documentary when Elwood got stuck in the wreckage and Jack rescued the expensive machine from being buried dozens of miles under the sea forever. As Jake rescued Elwood from his untimely death, the song "Just the Two of Us" was playing in the background. The whole audience roared with laughter not expecting such a comical moment.

"Ghost of the Abyss" was a historical documentary with had a sad undertone. As the camera dives into the depths of the ocean there are still a lot of recognizable details left in the wreckage. 

There were handcrafted windows still in optimal condition, mirrors left uncracked in the dormitories, and even a man's untouched bowler hat. All of these served as a reminder of the magnitude of what happened that day. 

As "Ghost of the Abyss" ends, it leaves the audience on a very gloomy note. The pictures of those who died on the Titanic flashed through the screen. "This can happen to anyone" is the final thought left by "Ghosts of the Abyss."  

That is why the story of the Titanic is so intriguing and unsettling. That is why so many people make movies, documentaries and Discovery channel specials based on this tragedy. 

Although I went to watch "Ghosts of the Abyss" doubting it's entertainment, it is surely a great film. It is a major step up from regular documentaries. 

Not only does it give a better perspective on Titanic than the fictional love-story "Titanic" can ever give, but it does so with taste. 

The fact that it is 3-D does not take away from the quality of the film. In fact in enhances the movie experience. I would recommend this movie to any movie or history lover.

Headline: Zombie's film 'Corpses' almost never released
Subheadline: Mike Szymanski, Knight-Ridder Tribune
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Rob Zombie, dressed in his characteristic dreadlocks and a shirt that says "I Drink Your Blood," slumps into a chair at the posh Mondrian Hotel in the heart of the Sunset Strip, where he's giving interviews about a baby he's been laboring over for three years.

"It got done," he sighs with some disbelief. "I'm here." 

Even less than a week before his "House of 1000 Corpses" horror film is slated for a limited release around the country by Lions Gate Films, the heavy metal star-turned-director isn't holding his breath for a project that was shelved for years and seemed destined to go to video.

"I'll believe it when I see it," the 37-year-old lead singer tells Zap2it.com. "You have to understand, I've already won, this project has been  shot in the head and left for dead so many times." 

Shot in the head, because the former Robert Cummings (yes, he legally has changed it now to Rob Zombie) has been through a torture chamber in the Hollywood studio system not unlike the fictional underground tomb of horrors he's created on film.

In 1998, he was asked to create a spooky maze for Universal Studio's temporary Halloween exhibit, and it was such a hit that they offered him a movie deal. 

Handed $4 million, he wrote and started filming a creepy horror film set in the 1970s and starring B-film stars such as Karen Black, Jeanne Carmen, Michael J. Pollard and Sid Haig (who's a staple from the Roger Corman fight films).

After the film was done, Universal chairwoman Stacy Snider sat in for a successful audience screening, but she had just returned from Congressional hearings urging studios to tone down violence in films. Bad timing.  

"I could see it in her face after the screening, she said, `Come to my office tomorrow,'" Zombie recalls. He never thought Universal would can the project altogether. 

Snider wasn't thrilled with the film. "She told me that she had to go by the instincts of her own set of values, under her own set of beliefs, and she could not release the film based on that," Zombie recalls.

He said he doesn't hold any grudges against Snider. "No, I didn't think they would dump it, but I have to give them credit, they could have chopped it up and made guitar picks out of it."

Instead, they let the project go, with the condition that they get a percentage of any deal made later, and MGM picked up the film. 

Then, Zombie had the misfortune to say to Ben Affleck on MTV, "Universal dropped it because they said it was morally corrupt, so MGM must have no morals." Within a week, he found out MGM also was dumping the project, giving no explanation. 

Universal's Snider was quoted in Variety as saying, "the film is a significant accomplishment for Rob, yet there is a visceral tone and intensity that we did not imagine from the printed page." 

Last August, Lions Gate president Tom Ortenberg said it was an "in-your-face unrelenting horror film experience" and picked up the film - now with a price tag of $11 million.

Born in Haverhill, Mass., Zombie attended Pratt Institute in New York, worked as an art director for a few porn magazines, then formed the band White Zombie, named for 1932 Bela Lugosi horror classic. 

He also worked for Paul Ruebens as an assistant for "Pee-Wee's Playhouse" when it was filmed in New York. "Yeah, I was doing crappy P.A. work in 1984 when I was there," Zombie smiles. 

In addition to selling 15 million records, he wrote the script for the film that would become "The Crow." He wrote songs for films such as "The Cable Guy," "End of Days," "Idle Hands," "Valentine," "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" and the much-anticipated "Matrix Reloaded."

"Karen Black was perfect to use as Mother Firefly (the matron of the murderers), and I'm glad that the studio didn't want to have big names or ask me to put Britney (Spears) music in or something like that," Zombie says, only half-mockingly. 

"Universal did suggest at one point that we shoot every murder two ways in case we didn't get an R rating, and, well, that wasn't going to happen."

He managed to get an R rating after five different edits.

Headline: Student show appeals to non-arts majors
Author: Charles Zachritz, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In an effort to draw a more diversified crowd of students, The Art Museum at FIU will host its 2003 Student Show.  This show will challenge most students' concept of art shows by exhibiting art not done by typical artists.  

In fact, the show will exhibit work done exclusively by FIU students regardless of their level of experience, major, or what classes they may be taking. 

The student art exhibit has been running annually for 19 of the museum's 24 years, making it something of a tradition at FIU. Since its first year, the show has offered students who aren't necessarily art majors or taking art classes a chance to exhibit their work.  

"It gives students a chance to have their work on exhibit at the museum, even if they have no affiliation to the art program at FIU," said Elizabeth Del Pozo.  

Del Pozo, an intern here at FIU, has worked very closely with Elizabeth Cerejido, the museum's exhibitions coordinator, to make the show happen. Together, they have been the heart of this production, organizing and promoting the event as well as rounding up dozens of sponsors for support.

"We were very happy to find a number of sponsors that donated some great prizes for the exhibit," Del Pozo said.

Prizes range from dinner for two at the Hyatt Regency's Two Sisters restaurant, to gift certificates from Books & Books bookstores. In addition to these prizes, merit awards will be given out to honor the more exceptional pieces on display.

The free event, sponsored by The Art Museum and Student Government, will be held from May 23 through June 11 during regular museum hours.  

On opening night, the event will kick off with a reception at 8 p.m. offering guests a chance to socialize while enjoying free food and drink. 

You don't need to get tickets for opening night and, as always, admission to the museum will be free for the duration of the event.

Cerejido thinks that students will get a lot from seeing the work of other students.

"The show will expose them to their peers' work, and hopefully appeal to their own artistic sensitivities.  It's a great chance for us to build bridges with students we don't usually have access to," Cerejido said.

Most students are under the impression that the only way to be involved in the art culture at FIU is by majoring in art, or at least taking an art class.

"I thought that only art students could have their work displayed. If I knew they'd let me, I'd make something to enter just to take advantage of the opportunity," said Jose Bowles, a freshman studying psychology.

A lot of students like Jose seem grateful for a chance to display their work in a real art museum.

"In 2001 we had about 200 people enter their work, and displayed around 100 of those pieces," Del Pozo said.  "We'd love to see the same enthusiasm this year."

This particular show is a big opportunity for the museum to reach out to more of the student body than it is currently able to.

"We want to break the barrier between those who are 'art students' and those who aren't.  We hope to foster an interest in the student body as a whole, so they can grow with us as the museum grows," Cerejido said.

Deadlines for entry are May 9th and 12th.

Headline: Colorful Britto artwork brightens dark times
Author: Robert J. Gramatges, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The worst seems to be over in Iraq, but the enduring shadow of war has yet to allow the sun to shine in our lives. The media is still saturated with war coverage, forcing those who want to indulge in think-free activities to look elsewhere.

If you are one of those people and find yourself strolling down Lincoln Road, you may find comfort in visiting Romero Britto's art gallery. 

Britto's work is definitely eye candy, but it goes beyond that. It displays the simple beauty of happiness that people sometimes forget exists. 

He infuses child-like cheer with sophisticated attention to detail to create his tasteful masterpieces. His works are a ray of light that permeate the fog that wartime uncertainty has plagued us with.   

Because he grew up in Brazil, Britto chose to focus on the positive aspects of his difficult life and created art that reflected that. 

His use of vivacious colors and light-hearted subject matter injected his clever images with an admirable devotion to optimism. 

His paintings tickle your infatuation by filling your eyes with sublimely combined colors and patterns. So flawless, they enrapture your imagination, transcending you into their idyllic environment for a moment of bliss. 

The luminosity that flows from him and inhabits his canvases is what rocketed him to fame. 

He first gained recognition designing advertisements for Absolut Vodka and Apple Computers, among others.   

Their mass appeal launched Britto into the mainstream, exposing his 'neo-pop cubism' to the masses. It is impossible to mistake his work for any other's. 

Interestingly, his signature style involves duplicating his actual signature to add texture to the backgrounds of his paintings.

Besides being an utter innovator, Britto accomplishes something that most artists of similar commercial success fail to: he uses his creations as a medium to convey his sanguine life perspective to the world. 

As a diversified artist, he spreads his expertise among several mediums. 

His most recent endeavors add a killer trendy paint job on a Mini Cooper and the release of Britto perfume to his repertoire.

Those who know Britto, love Britto. His simple art fulfills the public's need for levity in weighty times.   

An admirer of Britto's for quite some time, FIU student Melissa Alba puts it best when she says, "I see Britto's work as his vehicle for carrying messages of joy and the celebration of life. I enjoy his creations and admire his commitment to happiness."

Romero Britto summarizes his artistic mission quite clearly on his website (www.britto.com) "For me, art can reflect the celebration of the simple and good things in life. This is most important to me!" 

Through any medium he chooses (canvas, car, plane, sculpture, shoes) Britto conveys his humble message to a massive following, including everything from heads of state and celebrities to students at FIU. 

There is no better time than now to enjoy the trendy splendor that Britto dishes out.

Headline: FIU Theater produces thought provoking reality comedy with 'Baltimore'
Author: Felicidad Garcia, Copy Editor
&nbsp;
The first time I saw "The Hot L Baltimore," by Lansford Wilson, was around this time last year at a production at Miami-Dade Community College, and unfortunately, I was rather disappointed. This time around, I set off to that same play, showcased here at FIU for two weeks, with an attitude of feign indifference, expecting nothing, yet secretly hoping to be surprised. 

This modern rendition of a 1970s play, directed by FIU Professor Wayne Robinson, Jr., is set in an old hotel lobby, wherein age has caused the letter "E" to burn out on the sign outside, thus the name: The Hot L Baltimore. Upon entering the theatre, I remembered the laid back atmosphere this play was supposed to ensue, and succeeded in doing. Already, even with the house music playing in the background, there was a young man asleep on a couch in the middle of stage which was situated on the audience's ground level, with the seating arrangements encircling the actors like an old world amphitheater. 

The lines between the acting and reality in this play are blurry at best. It will happen on more than one occasion that as a member of the audience, you will forget your place and feel the need to interject at the character's feelings of frustration, joy, anger and love. 

There could not be a better array of characters in a play than there are in "The Hot L Baltimore," which includes at several intervals: an elderly man, three hookers, a mystic, a runaway and her mentally handicapped brother, just to name a few. 

All the characters, upon getting a one month notice of eviction due to the hotel's future demolition, meet at a common crossroad of confusion and loss.

 The dialogue is delivered with masterful timing, and an out-of-leftfield frankness in humor. 

The contradictions in the characters and their true personalities is what keeps the viewer most intrigued. Stereotypes regarding a certain class of people are thrown out the window as traditionally type-casted characters like hookers, turn out to be more intelligent and sincere than someone like the should-be-respectable manager of the hotel. 

A pretty rough and tough runaway named Jackie, travels along with her younger, mentally ill brother Jamie and plans to cultivate a soy bean farm in a piece of desert they were conned into buying. 

A 19-year-old drop out prostitute whose name keeps changing, is expected to know little more than how to turn tricks, but is actually an expert in U.S. geography, thanks to her extensive train travel. 

And remember the kid who was asleep as everyone walked in? Well his name is Paul Granger III, and he doesn't awake until the final five minutes of the first act during a climactic argument which involves most of the actors. Then he spends the rest of second act looking for clues as to the whereabouts of his grandfather but leaves frustrated and sad. Another hooker named April who is hilariously blunt about her "on-the-job experiences," turns out to be the most sensible sounding inhabitant of the hotel.

Yes, there is definitely something to be said about a play whose characters seem to feel a little too close for comfort, and still, perhaps, are right where they should be. 

As for the technical aspects of the production, I wanted to give special merit to the make-up crew for having achieved the aged look in the mystical elderly woman. 

Also, at pivotal moments in the plotless glimpse at these people's lives, the music created a pause for thought on the part of the characters as well as the audience that I really appreciated.

 The chaos was sometimes too much to take in at once, and those brief intervals of musical reflection allowed the viewer to both understand and sympathize with some of the very serious occurrences in the tenants' lives. 

I'll tell you now that this play has no resolution. Its ending is merely a stop that leaves you feeling helpless, but charitable; annoyed, but understanding. During a moment spent with the director at intermission, Robinson said, "It's a play about family, love, community and misfits."

If you missed "The Hot L Baltimore," feel sorry, because I walked up to the Wertheim expecting nothing, and if this play is chicken soup for the orphaned soul, I left the theater feeling very satisfied.

Headline: Juventud al escape
Subheadline: Lydia Guzmán
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Salió de su casa un domingo en la tarde. Dijo que estaría en casa de una amiga.  Las horas pasaron y, ya entrada la noche, su mamá comenzó a inquietarse. No era usual que su hija llegara tarde. No era usual que no llamara. Guíada por la preocupación, la madre llamó a casa de la amiga de su hija. Para su sorpresa, su niña nunca estuvo allí.

Yansis Massiel Juarez, una nicaraguense de 16 años, nunca amenazó con irse de su casa. Llevaba notas satisfactorias en la escuela y no presentaba problemas por uso de drogas ni alcohol. Llevaba sólo un año viviendo en Miami y, desde el 5 de mayo del pasado año, nadie la ha vuelto a ver.	

Este es el caso número 935403; uno de los aproximadamente 2,800 casos de niños fugitivos que se reportan en el Departamento de la Policía de Miami anualmente. Según sus estadísticas, en un 85 por ciento de estos casos se trata de adolescentes y un 95 por ciento de ellos suele aparecer en uno o dos días. Sin embargo, resta un 5 por ciento que nunca logra resolverse.

Fernando Fernández, detective de la Unidad de Investigaciones Juveniles de Miami-Dade, explicó que los casos de niños que se escapan de sus hogares o refugios se clasifican en dos categorías.

La primera se conoce como "fugitivo" e incluye niños que reinciden en el acto de escapar. La segunda categoría es el de "fugitivo en peligro", es decir niños que no tienen historial de escaparse. La información recopilada indica que su vida pudiera peligrar.  Fernández indicó que cada caso se aborda de forma diferente e individual, y aclaró que no existe ley alguna que exija un número de horas específico para atender un caso luego de reportado el desaparecido. 

A su juicio, los casos de fugitivo en peligro y los fugitivos menores de 12 años tienen prioridad y requieren acción inmediata.  

"Aún así, cada caso se evalúa por separado tomando en consideración las circunstancias particulares de cada uno", señaló Fernández.  

El detective informó que algunas de las causas más comunes del porqué escapan los niños son: la rebeldía de no querer seguir las reglas del hogar donde residen, el uso de drogas o el deseo de evadir programas de rehabilitación, su condición de testigos o víctimas de violencia o abuso en el hogar, las relaciones sexuales, el miedo al rechazo de la familia ante un embarazo a temprana edad y su deseo de poseer artículos de alto valor para los que el presupuesto del hogar no alcanza. Entonces recurren a negocios ilegales para poderlos adquirir.

La mayoría de los niños fugitivos acude a casas de amistades buscando refugio.  No obstante, en muy pocas ocasiones el niño permanece en un mismo lugar por mucho tiempo.  

"Usualmente en casa de las amistades los acojen por algunas semanas, tal vez meses, pero no para siempre. Llega el momento que estorban y tienen que buscar refugio en otro lado", explicó Fernández.  Añadió que algunos buscan ganarse la vida vendiendo drogas o prostituyéndose para lograr independencia económica.

En la Unidad de Investigaciones trabajan siete detectives, entre los cuales se dividen los casi tres mil casos que reciben cada año. Según indicó Fernández, se trabajan los casos y se recopila información sobre cada desaparecido que "pareciera que los conocemos de hace años."  

Aún así, Fernández admitió que para trabajar en dicha unidad se requiere un nivel de sensibilidad más alto que en otras unidades del Departamento de la Policía.  

"Aquí vienen padres llorando por la desaparición de un hijo y nos hacen llorar a nosotros. Yo también soy padre, y como padre entendiendo el dolor profundo de perder un hijo o de la angustia por desconocer su paradero", expresó el detective, quien lleva casi tres años laborando en esta unidad.

Bajo custodia

El Departamento de Niños y la Familia de la Florida (DCF) tiene bajo su custodia solamente niños que son víctimas de abuso, negligencia o abandono, según explicó Barbara Ongay, analista de la Oficina para la Seguridad Familiar del DCF.  

"Cuando estos niños se escapan del hogar sustituto o refugio donde los ubicamos, entonces se convierten en niños fugitivos bajo la custodia del DCF, no de la policía", sostuvo. Sin embargo, aclaró que en muchos casos el DCF trabaja íntimamente con la policía para lograr la recuperación del niño.

Ongay informó que aproximadamente un 86 por ciento de los niños fugitivos que el DCF tiene bajo su custodia son adolescentes mayores de 16 años, y un 75 por ciento de éstos son féminas.  

"Para las mujeres es más fácil sobrevivir en la calle porque pueden hacer dinero prostituyéndose. Para los varones no es tan fácil y, cuando aprieta el hambre, suelen volver a casa", comentó.   

Según la funcionaria, el porcentaje de los niños que escapa de hogares sustitutos o de refugios es el mismo que el de los niños que escapa de sus hogares natales. No obstante, muchos de los niños que están bajo custodia del DCF presentan traumas por violencia familiar, tienen problemas por uso de drogas o han sido víctimas de abuso sexual o físico. Ongay indicó que estos problemas previos son los causantes de las actitudes rebeldes que resultan en fugas. 

"Por esta razón, un niño fugitivo que escapa de su casa y que no tiene este tipo de trasfondo problemático, tiene mayores probabilidades de salir adelante que los niños fugitivos que están bajo nuestra custodia", dijo.  

El DCF cuenta con algunos programas de ayuda para los niños que tienen a su cargo.  Estos programas brindan ayuda sicológica y orientaciones de interés familiar tanto para el niño como para sus padres sustitutos.  

El Programa de Análisis de Comportamiento y el Grupo de Cuidado Residencial son algunos ejemplos. A pesar de la existencia de estos programas, Ongay dijo que no tienen suficiente cabida para la cantidad de niños con los que cuenta el departamento. 

"Quisieramos que existieran más programas disponibles para ayudar a estos niños. Algunos inclusive tienen hasta una lista de espera", señaló.

 El objetivo del DCF, según Ongay, es ubicar a los niños que tienen bajo su cargo en hogares en donde ellos puedan sentirse que pertenecen, y que le provean al niño una figura de autoridad que les inspire como modelo a seguir.  

"Cuando el niño siente que pertenece y que es importante para ese hogar, no quiere irse. Y si logran crearse ataduras emocionales entre el niño y una figura paternal o maternal a quien admire, mucho mejor aún.  Lamentablemente, ese objetivo no siempre se logra", afirmó. 

Según un reporte oficial presentado por el DCF a finales de 2002, el departamento tuvo 816 casos, de los cuales 719 se trataban de niños fugitivos.  De éstos, el DCF logró recuperar a 426, 28 fueron emancipados y 265 permanecieron desaparecidos. 

El reporte señaló además que un 77 por ciento de los niños fue encontrado en el mismo condado de donde desapareció; un 15 por ciento fue recuperado en la Florida; un 7 por ciento se encuentra fuera de la Florida y un 1 por ciento, fuera del país. Ongay  indicó que el 10 por ciento de los niños recuperados volvió a escapar, algunos en repetidas ocasiones.  

Los niños que escapan frecuentemente de los hogares sustitutos o refugios son clasificados por el DCF como fugitivos habituales. Marta Gómez, investigadora de casos del DCF, sostuvo que la mayoría de los reportes de niños desaparecidos se refiere a este tipo de casos.  Según Gómez, cuando se trata de fugitivos habituales, muchas veces el trabajador social del DCF sabe dónde y cómo encontrarlos, pero no lo hace.  

"El trabajador social tiene que cumplir con el proceso legal de ir a corte, notificar la recuperación y reubicarlo en el hogar sustituto. Es un proceso largo que se torna repetitivo cuando el niño, lo más probable, escape de nuevo al día siguiente", explicó. 

En la Florida, el que un niño escape de su lugar de custodia no es delito. Si el niño reincide en fugarse, el estado y el DCF no pueden hacer más que recuperarlo y devolverlo a su hogar tantas veces como la fuga suceda. Según el reporte oficial del DCF, los fugitivos habituales suelen irse de los hogares sustitutos o refugios porque se quejan de las condiciones pobres o abusivas en las que viven.

De acuerdo con un informe oficial del DCF, en septiembre de 2002 el departamento solicitó un aumento en presupuesto de $473 millones para mejorar su funcionamiento. Al presente, contaba con un presupuesto total de $3.6 billones y aspiraba llegar a los $4.1 billones una vez otorgado el aumento. Este dinero adicional sería utilizado para emplear más trabajadores sociales, mejorar salarios, desarrollar más programas de ayuda, mejorar los programas existentes, entre otros propósitos.  

Sin embargo, según el reporte presupuestario para el año 2003-2004 que presentó el gobernador Jeb Bush, el aumento que recibió el DCF fue de poco más de $251 millones.

Según Gómez, el DCF es tan eficiente como los recursos así lo permiten. Indicó que algunos trabajadores sociales del departamento tienen a su cargo más de 200 casos, y cada uno debe ser resuelto no más de treinta días después de elaborarse el primer reporte.

"No somos negligentes. Es que es humanamente imposible cumplir con todos los casos a tiempo", expresó la investigadora.   

Actualmente, el problema de los niños fugitivos en la Florida no tiene una solución definitiva. El Departamento de Policía hace lo posible por resolver la cantidad de casos que se reportan día tras día. El Departamento de Niños y la Familia lleva a cabo sus funciones con trabajadores sociales cargados de casos y con una gran limitación en sus programas de ayuda. Mientras, cada mes cientos de niños buscan fuera de sus hogares la seguridad y el bienestar que no encuentran en ellos.  

"Siempre tenemos esperanzas de recuperar a los niños sanos y salvos", manifestó el detective Fernández.  Con este pensamiento en mente, sólo resta tener fe de que niños como Yansis deseen un regreso a casa.

Lo primero que dijeron Gustavo González Meza, alias la Foca, y Víctor Javier García Uribe, alias el Cerrillo, al comparecer ante el juez fue que habían sido torturados. Los acusados del asesinato de ocho mujeres de Ciudad Juárez, México, narraron cómo les apagaron cigarros en el abdomen y quemaron el pene y los testículos con una pistola para dar descargas eléctricas. 

Oscar Maynes, ex jefe de peritos de la Procuraduría General de Justicia del Estado (PGJE), confirmó que las fotografías para documentar la tortura muestran cicatrices similares a las que dejan este tipo de armas. La defensa tomó algunas de esas fotografías, el resto son de fotoperiodistas que tuvieron acceso a los acusados durante la audiencia con el juez. Las fotografías están incluidas en el expediente.

Y desde prisión, los acusados insistían en esa versión.

"Me amarraron las manos... Me empezaron a dar patadas, de todo, a quemarme el estómago, mis partes. Primero me quemaron con un chicharra. También me apagaban cigarros en el estómago", narró el Cerillo.

Agregó que duraron varias horas golpeándolo, quemándole con cigarros y dándole toques eléctricos en sus genitales. 

"Me ponían agua. Me echaban líquido en la boca, eran como orines porque olía muy fuerte. Llegó el momento en el que ya no aguanté y les dije: 'voy a decir todo lo que ustedes me digan, pero déjenme en paz'. Para esto mientras me torturaban recibían muchas llamadas telefónicas. Eran de celular. Escuchaba que decían: 'Ya va capeando, ya va capeando'", dijo el Cerillo.

En el expediente la identidad de las mujeres quedó establecida debido a que los dos acusados firmaron las fotografías de los reportes de desaparición y reconocieron a las jovencitas como a las mujeres que violaron y asesinaron.

Pero la Foca aseguró ante el juez que también fueron torturados para firmar esos documentos. 

"Esas hojas nos hicieron firmarlas en la Academia (de Policía) a punta de golpes", dijo González Meza.

La tortura contra los choferes está registrada en cuatro documentos incluidos en el expediente. 

Tras su detención en los separos de la PGJE, los choferes fueron internados al Centro de Readaptación Social (Cereso) de Ciudad Juárez. Al ingresar a la prisión, a las 21:30 horas del 11 de noviembre, se les practicó una revisión para elaborar un certificado médico. Ambas revisiones concluyeron que tanto la Foca como el Cerillo presentaban "quemaduras en los órganos genitales y policontundidos", es decir, severamente golpeados. 

También existe una Fe Judicial de Sanidad practicada a las 14:30 horas del 12 de noviembre y con el folio 732576, en el que el juez establece que González Meza presentaba las siguientes huellas de violencia externa: aumento de volumen en pantorrilla y tobillo derecho, manchas oscuras en el pene, heridas en el abdomen, nariz enrojecida y genitales inflamados.   

La Fe Judicial de Sanidad con el folio 732603, realizada el mismo día a las 17:30 horas, establece que García Uribe tenía manchas en el abdomen y "heridas en el pene, mismas que para su percepción es necesario restirar el prepucio".

Estos cuatro dictámenes desmienten dos Certificados Previos de Lesiones emitidos por la PGJE, la misma dependencia que obtuvo la confesión. El médico legista Samuel Villalva Calleros oscultó al Cerillo las 02:40 horas del 11 de noviembre y determinó que tenía sólo una "pequeña zona equimótica en brazo derecho". Tan sólo cinco minutos después concluyó que la Foca "no presenta huellas externas de violencia recientes".

La defensa de los choferes calificó esto como "una mentira aberrante y un delito, ya que de la simple lectura de los certificados del médico del Cereso se advierte la falacia de estos certificados emitidos por el médico de la procuraduría".

Para Maynes, las huellas de la tortura son evidencia de que ni siquiera eso pudieron hacer bien los agentes de la PGJE, pues les urgía obtener la confesión a como diera lugar lo más rápido posible.

Pero el juez José Alberto Vázquez Quintero desestimó los alegatos de tortura, pues afirmó que las lesiones eran leves y el certificado de la PGJE establecía que al momento de confesar no había huellas de violencia. El juez incluso escribe en el auto de formal prisión "que no se descarta por la levedad de las lesiones que mostraron en su declaración preparatoria hayan sido este auto inflingidas".

"¿Cómo se las va a infligir uno mismo?", pregunta indignado el abogado penalista José Ignacio Esqueda. 

Además denuncia que el juez debió iniciar una investigación contra los agentes de la PGJE, sospechosos de torturar a los acusados, pues violaron la Ley Federal para Prevenir y Sancionar la Tortura. 

También el artículo Octavo de la ley anterior hubiera echado abajo la confesión, pues indica que "Ninguna confesión o información que haya sido obtenida mediante tortura podrá invocarse como prueba".

Para el abogado Dante Almaraz, "el juez (Vázquez Quintero) está en contubernio con el gobierno estatal". Maynes está de acuerdo y asegura que cuando turnaron a los acusados al juzgado, el juez rechazó el caso al ver la golpiza que éstos recibieron. 

"El expediente está inclinado", dijo Maynes.

El proceso fue cambiado de juzgado y ahora está en manos del juez séptimo de lo penal, Javier Pineda Arzala, de la ciudad de Chihuahua. Los acusados también fueron trasladados al penal de la capital del estado.

Un elemento más que hace sospechar de la veracidad de la confesión es la inusual abundancia de detalles. 

A pesar de que la misma confesión indica que los choferes consumieron cerveza, cocaína y mariguana, sus declaraciones coinciden palabra por palabra con las descripciones de los reportes de desaparición de las ocho mujeres. 

"La misma autoridad nada más la bajó y la puso ahí en la confesión para que los choferes la firmaran", dijo Maynes.

Un ejemplo es el caso de Guadalupe de la Rosa. Su reporte de desaparición menciona que tiene 20 años de edad, 1.60 de estatura, morena clara y complexión delgada, "vestía short blanco de mezclilla, blusa corta roja, zapatos tenis en color negro". La declaración del Cerillo dice: "recuerdo que era una muchacha morena clara, delgada y de estatura regular, traía un short de mezclilla blanco y una blusa corta color rojo, no recuerdo si traía zapatos o tenis". Mientras que la Foca declaró "Vestía un short, creo que blanco y blusa corta de color roja, era morena clara, de complexión delgada".

Las declaraciones de los siete asesinatos restantes siguen así: detallando colores, tamaños, complexiones, color de cabello. 

	Maynes, quien actualmente cursa un doctorado en psicología criminal, indica que es inconcebible que los acusados recuerden tal cantidad de detalles de las ocho mujeres. 

"En el lapso de un año y con tantas víctimas, confunden lo que traían puesto, sobre todo si andaban intoxicados", dijo Maynes.

"Ellos (los judiciales) nos decían lo que teníamos que decir, donde las habíamos encontrado, cómo se vestían y todo eso, nos dictaban todo eso para que nosotros lo dijéramos. Ellos nos lo decían y nosotros lo decíamos y lo grababan (en video)" dijo la Foca en prisión. 

Para colmo, el video de la confesión nunca fue presentado completo, sino editado. Para Maynes eso no debió ser aceptado ante el tribunal, pues "quiere decir que le cortan lo que no les conviene".

	A Rosario Acosta, integrante de la organización Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa, también le parecen sospechosos tantos detalles. 

"Casi podían hablar como si las conocieran. A que horas salían por el pan", dijo Acosta.

Pero agregó, "nosotros no avalamos la inocencia, pero tampoco la culpabilidad de estos dos hombres en tanto la culpabilidad no se demuestre, de otra forma estaríamos actuando igual que la procuraduría".

La detención

Almaraz señaló violaciones a los derechos humanos e irregularidades de los detenidos. El abogado concordó con otras opiniones de que los acusados no fueron detenidos, sino secuestrados. 

"El caso de la Foca y el Cerillo está lleno de arbitrariedades, desde su detención fuera de la ley y la confesión conseguida a base de la tortura", afirmó Acosta. 

Según Maynes y Almaraz, los dos choferes fueron secuestrados el 9 de noviembre. "No fue detención", coincidieron. La procuraduría negó tenerlos bajo custodia por varios días, sin embargo, los presentó el domingo. La PGJE reconoce en el expediente que la detención fue el viernes 9 de noviembre.

Almaraz aseguró que él y el otro defensor, Mario Escobedo, quien murió a manos de agentes de la procuraduría meses después, buscaron a los detenidos por todas las corporaciones policíacas y en todas les negaron información. 

"Fueron secuestrados y presentados hasta el domingo", denunció el abogado. 

	"La forma de detención fue sin orden de aprehensión, y a pesar de que no había flagrancia", dijo Almaraz. En otras palabras, habían pasado más de 72 horas desde que se cometieron los crímenes, por los que Almaraz reclamó que la detención fue ilegal. Además, la ley faculta a la policía a detener a un sospechoso cuando haya pruebas o indicios de su probable responsabilidad, pero en este caso la probable responsabilidad se acreditó después del arresto, cuando los choferes confesaron.

	El arresto, coincidieron abogados y ex funcionarios de la PGJE, fue realizado por agentes enmascarados de una manera violenta. Frente a la esposa y el hijo recién nacido de uno de los arrestados, lo amenazaron con matarlo si se resistía. 

"Fueron detenidos brutalmente y generaron el pánico", dice Almaraz.

	Además, el Cerillo y la Foca no fueron llevados a los separos de la procuraduría, como lo marca la ley, sino a una casa particular, y después a la Academia Estatal de Policía. En ambos lugares fueron torturados.

Esqueda, que tiene 12 años como abogado penalista, denunció que en este caso también se ignoró el artículo penal 334 del Código Penal de Chihuahua, que especifica que "toda declaración obtenida de una persona privada de su libertad no tendrá valor probatorio".

Testimonios que se esfuman

El 4 de diciembre, la oficina de comunicación social de gobierno del Estado en Ciudad Juárez, convocó a conferencia de prensa a los medios para escuchar el testimonio de la señora "Luz", la mujer que hundiría al Cerillo al narrar cómo fue víctima de una agresión sexual el 5 de junio de 1996.

Luz narró con lujo de detalle cómo fue secuestrada, golpeada y manoseada por el Cerillo esa madrugada. También contó que éste la golpeó en varias ocasiones hasta nublarle la vista. Ella declaró que escapó gracias a que mordió y rasguñó los genitales de su atacante hasta que éste perdió el sentido. 

La mujer presentó una denuncia ante la PGJE pero, ante el temor que le causaba volver a ser atacada por el Cerillo, aseguró que se fue a vivir a Los Angeles. Volvió a Juárez para visitar a su madre enferma. Entonces reconoció al Cerillo en la televisión y decidió volver a poner la denuncia en su contra.

Al finalizar la conferencia de prensa, Suly Ponce, ex titular de la fiscalía especial y en ese entonces jefa de Ministerios Públicos, informó que la denuncia y el testimonio de Luz se agregarían al expediente y se pediría una orden de aprehensión adicional por este ataque, "pues es un indicio y sobre todo es acreditar la conducta y peligrosidad de este individuo". Ponce se vio envuelta en un escándalo cuando se reveló que ofreció dinero al empleado de un circo por incriminar a alguien en un asesinato que, según Maynes, puede estar vinculado con los ocho de noviembre.

Pero la realidad es que el testimonio de Luz, al igual que el de otra joven que dijo haber sido acosada sexualmente por el Cerillo, nunca fueron incluidos en el expediente. Las declaraciones se quedaron en meras ruedas de prensa. 

Según Almaraz, esto se debe a que el testimonio fue fabricado por la PGJE para condenar a los choferes ante la opinión pública, pues la inusual rapidez con la que actuaron las autoridades creó muchas interrogantes ante la sociedad.

Maynes afirmó que Luz ni siquiera cumple con el perfil de las jovencitas atacadas. 

Además, Maynes y Almaraz revelaron que Luz trabajaba en una cantina de El Paso, su esposo estaba preso en Juárez y fue liberado a cambio del testimonio. 

Lo que sí está en el expediente son las declaraciones de Agustín Toribio Castillo, alias el Kiany, y José Gaspar Ceballos Chávez, alias el Gaspy, actualmente enjuiciados por el asesinato de varias mujeres en 1999. Los dos acusados vincularon al Cerillo en la violación y muerte de una mujer en sus confesiones, pero después de realizar careos frente al juez, los dos reconocieron que habían mentido y se negó la orden de aprehensión en su contra. Pero la PGJE omitió este último detalle.

Crimen no sancionado, aumenta

La raíz de tanta negligencia radica en la incapacidad, o falta de voluntad política para resolver los homicidios, coincidieron varios personajes.

"Para empezar se tiene que reconocer el problema, que tenemos a alguien que está matando mujeres y anda afuera. Que es alguien bastante organizado y ya está bastante especializado", dijo Maynes, "pues los choferes no son".

Maynes añadió que ya es hora de reconocer que en Ciudad Juárez se siguen cometiendo asesinatos seriales que siguen un patrón muy definido, como las características físicas de las víctimas. 

Sin embargo, la PGJE ni siquiera en eso se puede poner de acuerdo. Mientras que para Rocío Urías, encargada de elaborar los reportes de desapariciones, los rasgos físicos de las mujeres son un factor vital para determinar si una desaparición es de alto riesgo, para Esparza Navarrete, las características físicas de las víctimas no son preponderantes. 

Esparza Navarrete aseguró que el hecho de que la mayoría de las víctimas sea morena, baja de estatura y delgada, no es inusual, pues asegura que la mayoría de las mujeres juarenses tiene esa apariencia física. 

"A mí háblenme de que están desaparecidas muchachitas de 1.80, rubias, de ojos azules, y yo creo que ahí sí me preocuparía un poquito más, porque ahí ya hay un patrón muy definido", dijo Esparza Navarrete.

Pero para Maynes es precisamente esta actitud la que ha impedido resolver los asesinatos. 

Incluso aseguró que estas ocho muertes están vinculadas a otras víctimas descubiertas con anterioridad y con los tres cuerpos que se hallaron en las orillas de Juárez en octubre.

"Pero esta persona, el nivel de especialización que tiene, me dice que no empezó ahorita, es alguien que ya tiene bastante tiempo haciéndolo", dijo Maynes.

"Hay una ley de la criminología: 'Delito que no es sancionado, aumenta'. Y las autoridades, al no solucionar estos crímenes, contribuyen a que sigan los asesinatos", agregó.

Y mientras las autoridades navegan en una negligencia tremenda que impide resolver de una vez por todas estos crímenes, ocho familias que perdieron a sus hijas, y otras dos que perdieron a sus padres y esposos, siguen esperando una justicia que no llega.
