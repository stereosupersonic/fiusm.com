To Whom It may Concern,
I am an alumni of FIU. I was a staff photographer for The Beacon Newspaper, starting in 1995. I would like to know if you or someone could please research any old articles or/and photos of my past work so I can place in my portfolio of photographs. They were on-campus work, from a story on dolphins in a small swimming tank at the back of FIU North, to photos on new structures near the conference center at FIU North. If you can help me, I would truly appreciate it. Thank you for your time.

Yours Truly,

Tiffany Stennett

&nbsp;
I recently enolled in FIU as a transient student from FSU and suddenly find myself curiously tempted to move back home and enroll as a full time student. As a journalism major (/fashion merchadising minor) I would really appreciate any experience I could recieve working in and around The Beacon. Seeing as I am not yet officially a permanant member of the FIU student body I understand and conquer with my advisor's opinion that this would inhibit me from obtaining any type of full position however, I would really appreciate even a few hours a week helping out with anything that at present time may require help, an internship if for lack of a better word. I would really appreciate anything you could offer me. Please let me know if any of this is even possible.  
Thanks again

Headline: Softball reaches SBC title game, but falls to Rajin' Cajuns
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers travelled to Bowling Green, Kentucky this past week to participate in the Sun Belt Conference tournament.


Game One

FIU 2, Middle Tenn. 1



Senior center fielder Nicole Dubovik singled home the game-winning run in the bottom of the seventh inning to advance the Golden Panthers to the second round of the Sun Belt Conference Tournament with a 2-1 victory over No. 3 seed Middle Tennessee on Thursday in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

The Golden Panthers were able to jump out to an early lead in the third inning. 

Senior shortstop Stephanie Wolter started things off with a single to left field, then advanced to second base on a Dubovik sacrifice bunt. 

First baseman Cynthia Turek then knocked home Wolter with a RBI double to left-center, giving FIU a 1-0 lead.

FIU cruised until the sixth inning when sophomore staff ace Amanda Nealer ran into trouble. Kip Phillips and Cortney Mitchell recorded consecutive singles off of Nealer, giving the Lady Raiders two runners in scoring position.

Freshman Nicole Barrett came on to replace Nealer with one out, and struck out two of the three batters she faced, but a issued a costly wild pitch that tied the score at one.

But the Lady Panthers struck back in the seventh. Amber Gill doubled to center field. Meagan Dontrich then bunted to advance Carmen Lopez, who pinch ran for Gill, to third base. Dubovik then came up with two outs, and delivered the game-winner, a single to left field, to put FIU up for good.

Barrett (5-6) earned the win for the Golden Panthers.



Game two

ULL 6, FIU 0



ULL's Brooke Mitchell was too much to overcome, striking out 16 Golden Panthers, as FIU fell to the 21st ranked Rajin' Cajuns 6-0 on Friday afternoon.

Junior third baseman Jennifer Owens was the lone Golden Panther to record a hit, as Mitchell (21-6) went seven shutout innings to earn the complete game victory.

Kendra Laminack (11-11) took the loss for FIU, allowing five runs, six hits, and six walks in only 4.2 innings of work.

The Cajuns (42-8) scored in four of their six innings at bat, capped by a three-run sixth inning to seal the victory.

The Golden Panthers had a chance to do some damage in the fifth. Meagan Dontrich and Stephanie Wolter both had opportunities to knock in runs with the bases loaded. But Mitchell got out of the jam and struck out both.

"Brooke Mitchell pitched a great game, striking out 16 - seven looking - and allowing just one hit," said Golden Panther head coach Kim Gwydir.

"[Offensively] we weren't ready to swing," she added.



Game Three

FIU 5, WKU 0



The Golden Panther offense rediscovered their bats, and Amanda Nealer and Nicole Barrett combined for a shutout, leading FIU to a 5-0 victory over the Hilltoppers in their second game of the day on Friday.

FIU took the lead in the second inning on a solo homerun by designated player Marleah Stapf.

The Panthers added two more runs in the third off of three Hilltopper errors to make the score 3-0.

Second baseman Lindsay Tippings added a RBI double in the fourth to increase the lead to 4-0.

Third baseman Jennifer Owens added a double of her own in the fifth, driving home Nicole Dubovik to expand the advantage to 5-0.

That was all the scoring Nealer would need. Nealer (21-7) allowed only five hits and struck out three in five innings of work.

"Amanda came out and pitched a great game," said head coach Kim Gwydir.

"And Marleah crushed a homerun to get our offense on track."



Game four

ULL 6, FIU 2



The Golden Panthers entered the championship game with momentum, but ran into a familiar foe- ULL's Brooke Mitchell, who shut down the Golden Panthers for the second straight day, leading the Rajin' Cajuns to a 6-2 victory over FIU on Saturday.

The win gave ULL its fourth straight Sun Belt Conference championship.

FIU managed just three hits this time, two more than Friday, against Mitchell who dazzled the Lady Panthers, striking out eight over seven innings.

Louisiana-Lafayette wasted no time, scoring three runs in the top of the first off Amanda Nealer.

Marleah Stapf scored on an error in the second to cut the lead to 3-1.

Nicole Dubovik scored on another ULL error in the sixth, to draw within one.

But the Cajuns exploded again in the seventh, when Sun Belt Freshman of the Year Danyele Gomez blasted a three-run shot off Nealer to increase the lead to 6-2. Mitchell (22-6) retired the FIU side in the bottom of the seventh to earn the Sun Belt Championship and Sun Belt tournament's Most Outstanding Player.

Nealer (21-8) went 6.1 innings, allowing six runs on eight hits, while striking out 11 Rajin' Cajuns.

"Amanda pitched a good game, but she ran out of gas in the seventh inning," said head coach Kim Gwydir.

"I thought we really had a chance. But, Brooke Mitchell is an awfully tough pitcher to beat."

FIU finished the season as the Sun Belt Conference runner-up for the second straight year.

Headline: Softball makes history with first Regional berth
Subheadline: Nine named to All-SBC team; Gwydir named Coach of the Year
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The FIU softball team received incredible news Sunday night, when they were informed they had just been invited to their first regional appearance ever.

The at-large bid places the Golden Panthers as the fifth seed in the Lincoln, Nebraska Regional, which gets underway this Thursday where they will  meet Mississippi State (33-28) at 10:00 a.m.

"This puts FIU softball on the map as a national power and shows the respect we have gained across the country," said head coach Kim Gwydir.

The other four teams to round up the Lincoln Regional include Washington (40-14), Nebraska (36-15), Iowa (40-13), Pacific (34-22), Hofstra (37-15), and Creighton (25-22).

 

Softball Coach Kim Gwydir was named 2003 Sun Belt Conference Coach of the Year and nine Golden Panthers were voted onto the All-Sun Belt Conference team this past Tuesday as a result of their exceptional performance on the field, leading to a school-best 11-3 conference record this season.

Landing on the Sun Belt's first team were senior outfielder Nicole Dubovik, junior first baseman Cindy Turek, junior designated player Kristen Perry, and sophomore pitcher Amanda Nealer.

Rounding out the group on the All-SBC second team were senior shortstop Stephanie Wolter, junior third baseman Jennifer Owens, sophomore catcher Marleah Stapf, sophomore second baseman Lindsay Tippings, and freshman pitcher Nicole Barrett.

The nine selections were the most in the conference and also the most-ever in the six-year history of the program.

It marked the second time Gwydir has won coach of the year.

Headline: Baseball takes two from New Orleans
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
After a brutal stretch that saw them lose eight of their past ten games, the Golden Panthers (32-19, 10-10 Sun Belt) looked to regroup this past weekend in New Orleans, taking two of three games from the Privateers.



FIU 5, N.o. 1



Arthur Santos, the only FIU pitcher to record a win in three weeks, continued his recent hot surge with a dominating performance, leading the Golden Panthers to a 5-1 victory Friday night in New Orleans.

Shortstop Luis Rivera got FIU off to a quick start in the first, reaching first base on an error by New Orleans third baseman Austin Wasserman. Designated hitter Bryan Pullin followed with a RBI single, giving the Golden Panthers an early 1-0 lead.

Right fielder Solomon Frieder helped add to the scoring in the fourth. 

After a Ricardo Nanita single, Frieder (2-for-4, two RBI) tripled to right center, boosting the FIU advantage to 2-0.

Frieder continued his hot hitting in the sixth, knocking his second homerun of the season over the left field fence, making the score 3-0.

Pullin (2-for-4, two RBI) decided to get in on the action in the seventh, hitting his first homerun of the season off New Orleans reliever David Gray, increasing the lead to 4-0.

Catcher Michael New provided more insurance when he crushed another blast in the ninth, his fourth of the year, giving the Golden Panthers a comfortable 5-1 lead. 

Santos, who has lowered his ERA in the each of the last five outings, gave the injury-riddled Panther pitching staff a much needed lift. 

The junior hurler went seven innings, allowing eight scattered hits and only one earned run, while striking out five to improve his record to 3-7 on the season.

Sophomore Derek DeCarlo, who has been temporarily optioned to the bullpen because of a hip problem, closed out the final two innings to earn his second save of the season for FIU.



FIU 13, N.o. 10



The Golden Panthers improved their conference record to 10-10, and more importantly clinched a Sun Belt tournament berth, defeating the Privateers 13-10 again Saturday in New Orleans.

Junior catcher Mario Monreal came up huge offensively for the Golden Panthers, going 4-for-6 with four RBI, with three of the RBI coming in the deciding ninth inning.

FIU got going early once again, with first baseman Mike Lopez starting things off with a single. Bryan Pullin followed with a double, giving FIU runners on second and third with one out. Ricardo Nanita then singled to left, giving the Panthers the early 1-0 lead.

Freshman closer Edgar Ramirez, who started the game, ran into trouble against his first batter, suffering a lead-off homerun to Joe Pietro, evening the contest at one apiece.

The Golden Panthers took the lead again in the second. After a Jimmy Bacon single, Monreal doubled to advance Bacon to third. Shortstop Luis Rivera then drove home Bacon with a sacrifice fly to center, putting FIU briefly ahead 2-1.

The Privateers answered back again in the bottom of the second. Ramirez walked the first two batters, then committed an error on a bunt, to help New Orleans even the score. 

Second baseman Dennis Diaz followed with an error of his own to give the Privateers a 3-2 edge.

FIU responded in the third when junior Fernando Alvarez tripled home Pullin, tying the score at three.

Lopez (4-for-6, three runs, RBI) gave FIU the lead again in the fourth with a solo shot to center, his fourth of the season.

The Golden Panthers added to the score in the sixth. 

Diaz made up for his early error with a two-run single to right-center, giving FIU a 6-3 lead. Solomon Frieder added another run with a RBI single to center, making the score 7-3.

The Privateers responded in the bottom of the sixth, scoring three more runs off FIU freshman Ammer Cabrera and junior Luis Gazitua, capped by a homerun by New Orleans shortstop Mike Rohde, to cut the deficit to 7-6.

Monreal retaliated with a homerun in the seventh, and Pullin knocked home another run with a RBI single, to increase the Panther lead again to 9-6.

After a Skip Adams run in the top of the inning to make the score 10-6, the Privateers came storming back, producing four runs off the Golden Panthers' top two pitchers. 

Junior Josh Banks issued a leadoff walk followed by a double. 

Sophomore Derek DeCarlo then came on to relieve Banks. DeCarlo allowed four runs, two charged to Banks, and the Privateers knotted the game at ten.

But the Golden Panther bats responded again in the ninth. Senior Adam Summerell singled to left field and Diaz followed with a walk. 

Senior Skip Adams was then intentionally walked with two outs to load the bases for Monreal, who doubled to right field to clear the bases, giving FIU the 13-10 win.

But DeCarlo had luck on his side once again.

DeCarlo, despite blowing the lead, earned his fifth win of the season and remains undefeated in his collegiate career. 

With the win, DeCarlo set a new Sun Belt Conference record with 16 consecutive victories.

Subheadline: Haritan's talents not limited to football
Author: Dan Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If it had not been for Irabelle Linker, grandmother of FIU strong safety John Haritan, her grandson would probably not be where he is today. Haritan, who is making the transition from linebacker to safety, saw both his parents lose their battles to cancer as a child. His father passed when he was only six and his mother when he was 13.

"She took us under her wing, me and my three sisters," said Haritan who was also the anchor on his high school's 4x100 relay team. "She just raised us all and did a great job. She's a saint."

Haritan is not content at just being good. He strives to be great at any task he decides to take on and eventually finds a way to conquer it- usually being an opposing team's ball carrier. 

While a wrestler in high school, Haritan compiled a 39-1 record and was honored as the top heavyweight wrestler in four tournaments his senior year. Haritan even credits most of his football success to his history on the mats.

"The mental attitude that wrestling gives you is far and away," he said. "You can tell late in the game when people are tired my mindset is above everyone else's. That is all from wrestling, you cannot get that anywhere else."

Hopefully the attitude carries over into photo shoots as well. Haritan, who is a Renaissance man and jack of all trades also models for Ocean Drive Magazine and Abercrombie and Fitch in addition to excelling in athletics.

And according to defensive back Kris Thomas, Haritan is quite popular among the ladies on campus.

Haritan just shrugs it off and smiles. "You're a football player, [so] generally you're just going to get more attention," 

When Haritan, who blocked the first punt in school history was asked about it, he joked, "That might have something to do with it."

In addition to modeling, wrestling and football, in which Haritan was honored on numerous occasions, he also participated in weightlifting and track while at Lyman high school in Longwood, Fla. As a football player Haritan was all-everything including the Orlando Sentinel's defensive player of the year, which he describes as "awesome." 

However, it is his team MVP award that Haritan covets most. "It shows you supported the team and were a team player," said the 5'11" 192 pounder who also punted in high school. "You gave everything you had for the team."

 Defensive back coach Hurlie Brown, who played at Miami said that Haritan is real good for the level they're at and could possibly have been a division one player as a late bloomer. "We're very lucky to have him," said Brown. "You never have to chase John to watch film or to go work out. He leads by example but he will get vocal if he has to." 

Haritan led the Golden Panthers in tackles last season with 86, 14 of which came in FIU's defeat at the hands of Western Kentucky-the eventual I-AA national champions. This theme was a recurring one as Haritan anchored the defense in the Golden Panthers' final scrimmage of the spring after seeing limited action in the previous intra-squad contest in lieu of reserves that the coaching staff wanted to evaluate for the upcoming season.

But if Haritan's performance in the final scrimmage is any indication, opposing receivers might want to look twice before coming over the middle this season.

Headline: Founding member retires, student questions FIU's ethics
Author: Andy Diaz/ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
I'm convinced that my greatest fear, next to a minatory fear of death, is becoming obsolete, irrelevant. It's not so much that my ideology is becoming archaic in this rapidly changing world, like those Fox News anchormen who resort to writing books with endless diatribes about what a great country America was in the 50s - which was, coincidentally, when blacks and women weren't so uppity - or the old men Woody Allen's character talks about at the beginning of Annie Hall, who wander into New York delis yelling about socialism. 

What I mean is, my greatest fear is becoming obsolete by overextending my welcome at a certain stage in life - although this is exactly what my guru, George Carlin, recommends: "don't take any shit from the Zeitgeist"- much like that friend who doesn't leave your party until you throw him out at 4 a.m. It's happened to me before too, and somebody had to throw me out of the metaphorical party. 

A sobering experience, indeed.

The first sign that I was coming close to overextending my welcome at FIU ( although I am still within the four years allotted to undergrads by tradition) came this semester when English Professor Butler Waugh announced he was retiring. Waugh, not Prof. Waugh, not Butler Waugh (for those who of us who know him well and type his monosyllabic last name into the  online interactive class schedule every semester, he will forever be known as just "Waugh") was in some sort of Kevin Bacon way, synonymous with FIU for me. Perhaps because for the last two years, I've taken at least one class with him every semester, or maybe simply because being one of the four founding members of the university there has never existed an FIU without a WAUGH.

Until now. In typical FIU fashion his 30 years of service and founding father status at the university earned him no more than a gold (plated) watch with the FIU logo on it and a plaque signed by our fearless leader, Modesto Maidique, who along with the rest of the administration was in conspicuous absentia from the retirement party - Paul Gallagher, executive vice president of Business and Finance, made a relatively commendable appearance at the end. This indifferent attitude toward Waugh is congruous with the attitude toward the English department, and a lot of other departments in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Today, FIU boasts Research I status, a football team and a law school. yet the English professors are limited to a miniscule amount of allowed photocopies (I hope, dear reader that, if you weren't privy to this information before, you're now letting out a self-deriding stentorian laugh before you stop to question your collegiate decision making; I know I did). Most of the English classes are taught by teaching aides and consequently, the classes being offered are insipid and poorly conducted. Still, I hope they won't hold this against me - I drink with these people. 

The classes that are worth taking can be satiated with 15 credits. These so-called "achievements" that the university so vociferously pitches to us, the plebeian students, and to the incoming freshmeat class with their oneiric notion of college that will soon shatter, are mere propaganda in order to make us look more and more like UF. This raises a very important question which the movers and shakers of FIU have either overlooked or just ignored. How can a university hope to gain recognition if it can't even properly fund and maintain an English department?

With Waugh gone, the English department loses one of those reliable professors that taught at least one poignant class every semester. And now he'll probably be replaced by five ersatz adjuncts who'll teach our incoming freshmen class of "urban professionals," - or whatever ridiculous demographic it is we're supposed to be aiming for - how to write an essay and the difference between iambic pentameter and free verse - undoubtedly a sad future for our little ol' airfield.

Headline: Health plan gives students much needed option
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Finally international students' voices are not going unheard. 

After many international students - who are mandated to have health insurance by Federal law - brought concerns about limited health insurance options to student government, Student Government Administration and FIU administration approved a plan that will provide dental, pharmacy and vision care at a rate that most students can afford.  With all the restrictions international students face, it's about time FIU did something to make their lives easier. 

This discount health plan is also available to non-international students and provides a much needed option for students who may not be covered by their parents' insurance plan. With annual rates ranging from $15 to $40 per plan, and promises of no age restrictions, deductions and maximums, or filling out claims forms, this plan seems like an affordable option for college students.

And it is definitely a step in the right direction to helping international students deal with the restrictions they face. FIU may not be able to eliminate the restrictions, but they should do as much as they can to help international students, as well as the rest of the student body.

Headline: Housing headache without remedy?
Author: Alejandra Diaz/ Recruitment Editor
&nbsp;
Convenience, comfort and a "home away from home" is what university housing sells to FIU students. The problem is that you not only  rent a "home" but also a guaranteed headache at the end of the semester.  

After living in housing for a year and a half, I've learned that moving in and out of complexes is a Nuisance. I say nuisance with a capital "N" because finding boxes, packing and looking for temporary storage is nothing compared to having to wait for a call loaded with a powerful message.  This call causes you to move out of one complex/room into another in a matter of 24 hours. Can it be done? Of course. Is it ideal? I think not. 

Housing policy states that a student moving from one complex to the other must move out at the end of the semester within 24 hours after their last final. In my case, this 24 hour time limit meant moving from Biscayne Bay Campus' Bay Vista housing to University Park's Panther Hall. 

Being forewarned of this 24 hour time limit, I began to pack a week in advance and made plans with friends to move out sometime during the weekend.  I had my affairs in order and except for a few boxes, I was prepared to move.  This ideal move of mine quickly turned tragic when I received  a phone call from Panther Hall on a Sunday at 11:20 p.m stating that I had 24 hours to move out of BBC and into UP.  Within a matter of moments, my move quickly turned to a frenzy of last minute packing and planning. 

I soon realized I needed to rent a U-Haul early Monday morning, if not I was going to be subjected to a $100 fine for missing my check-out time. I panicked. How was I to rent a truck at the last minute and expect to save money?  I may work at The Beacon but that doesn't mean that I am not a broke college student.  

After packing for half the night, I woke up early Monday morning and spent the next four hours looking for a U-Haul truck all over North Miami. Ninety-five dollars in debt and half a tank of gas later, my best friend and I drove the truck back to BBC and began moving. Exhausted and frustrated, I called housing demanding justification for my grief. Eventually speaking to a secretary, I was politely told "this is the best way we have figured out how to do it. You are not the first person to call asking for a day and time [to move out] because you have to rent a U-Haul." I was appalled. 

It soon became apparent to me that housing "officials" had no idea what it meant to be woken up on a Sunday and told, "you have 24 hours to move into your new room."  Now that I think about it, I was elated and devasted all at the same time. I learned that it's best to be patient and assume that all will be well, in due time.

&nbsp;
The FIU Evening Master of Business Administration program is not only gaining a positive reputation, but is also helping to spread the word about FIU academic standards. 
The FIU team recently beat out the competition and won first place in the Intercollegiate MBA Business Case Competition at the University of South Florida in Tampa.  
At the competition, teams of five from various state universities, including rival Florida Atlantic University, University of Central Florida, and University of South Florida, were assigned cases and allowed a day to prepare and present to the judges.  Although this was the first time FIU participated at the graduate level, participants Pedro Echeverria, Craig Kirsner, Robert Johnson, Samuel Martinez, and Paola Moreno proved that FIU comes second to none.  According to Ellie Browner, the director of the Evening Program, this was an extraordinary experience, both for FIU MBA students and faculty members.

Headline: AZD hosts Fuzzie Football
Author: Adriana Oliva/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Fuzzie Football is not the typical set of five foot, 11 inches, 220 pounds of athletic male in pads and iron, running into one another. It is a bunch of FIU and non-FIU people coming together, forming groups and helping Alpha Xi Delta raise money for the Family Resource Center, Hurwit Nursery. 

Alpha Xi Delta, AZD, kicks of its fourth annual Fuzzie Football on May 18 at the FIU intramurals field. The event takes place from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Registration takes place from 9 - 9:45 a.m. with the first game breaking at 10 a.m. 

It is expected that this year, there will be between four and six women's teams and 12 - 16 men's teams. 

"This year promises to be our best year ever," said Griselle Diaz, senior and president of AZD. 

Registration applications were left at the Dadeland Mall Champs Sports Store and the Kendall Sports Authority. So far, there are 10 registered teams - eight men's teams and two women's team. 

"The last day to register is May 15 because we need to set up our rosters and organize the divisions," Diaz said.

Teams are composed of seven - 10 players. Registration fee is $15 per player and includes cover fee, food, music and a t-shirt. Spectators can come and cheer on their favorite team for a charge of $5 in advance or $7 the day of the event. 

"We encourage everyone to come out and support," Diaz said.

The group that has the most fan support will be awarded with a $100 cash prize. 

A live DJ and party station 93.1 will provide music.

"We were really lucky to get 93.1. Aside from providing a DJ, they will have giveaways," Patrice Lastra, AZD member said. "Plus it adds enthusiasm, energy and motivation for everyone at Fuzzie Football."

Breakfast will be catered by Einstein Bagels. It has yet to be decided whether it will be Shorty's BBQ or Longhorn Steakhouse who will cater the lunch menu for the event. 
   Aside from donations from 93.1, Einstein and either Shorty's or Longhorn, the intramural department has generously donated the field, as well as supplied equipment such as the footballs.

Alpha Xi Delta conducts other events throughout the year for the same philanthropy. 

Recently, in March, they held a baby drive where they collected over $8,000 in donations and supplies. 

Other events include Fall Ball, a banquet which is open to the community; Xi Man, a contest in which men try to become the Alpha Xi Delta gentleman and sorority sweetheart; and a toy drive. All donations collected through these events are sent to the Family Resource Center, Hurwitt, in Carol City.

FIU President Modesto Maidique, along with the presidents of  four other Florida public universities participated in a "fly around" press conference to major cities to reject budget cuts, such as the proposed $12.6 million loss that FIU may undergo.

The presidents banded together at the Signature Flight Support terminal in Miami International Airport, Thursday, to argue that such cuts would only resort in larger and fewer classes, fewer student services, and higher tuition, among other student disadvantages.

Headline: FIU celebrates its first Haitian Week
Author: Sarah Rodriguez/ Biscayne Bay News Editor
&nbsp;
This week, FIU will co-sponsor its own celebration of Haitian art, history, and culture with the school's first-ever Haitian Week.   All students, faculty, and community members are invited to attend the events scheduled for May 13-15 at the Biscayne Bay Campus.  

FIU has been working in conjunction with Tropiculture, the Haitian-American Cultural Society and Miami-Dade County to bring Haitian Week to FIU.  The first event in the celebration was a job fair and employment workshop, which took place on May 1. 

Raul Moncarz, vice provost of Academic Affairs at BBC and coordinator of Haitian Week, has been working closely with various student organizations to ensure the success of cultural events such as this one. 

"Hopefully, we can get a tradition of participation that applies to all students, not only Haitians," Moncarz said.  "It is so important to participate in clubs.  For the students who don't want to work here, they will be learning about Haitian culture and know about our diverse community."

The week's events will deal with Haitian art, history, and culture and kick off on May 13 with Museum of the Sea, a slide presentation shown by lecturers Gerald Piquion and Rachel Doucet in the Mary Ann Wolfe Theatre from 7:30-8:30 p.m.

Haitian Week attendees will also have the opportunity to view and purchase Haitian art from the Soley Leve (Rising Sun) exhibit, which will be held in the Mary Ann Wolfe Theatre on May 13 from 6 - 7:30 p.m. and on May 14 and 15 from 6 - 9 p.m.  

According to Moncarz, proceeds from this year's art exhibit will go toward FIU's Haitian student organizations, and in coming years might be used to fund scholarships.

"There's going to be very fine art.  Some of the profits, hopefully a portion...will go to the Haitian Student Organization here at FIU, at the Biscayne Bay Campus," Moncarz said.  "And that eventually may be converted into scholarships."

The level of participation in the coordination of the event has been high, says Moncarz, including help from members of student government, the Haitian Student Organization, the Humanities Club, Alpha Phi Sigma, as well as faculty from the Student Affairs office and African New World Center.

Organizers decided to host this event in May, to celebrate Haitian Cultural Heritage month.  Haitians celebrate the month of May because it is the birth month of Toussiant Louverture, the Haitian general, who is remembered for organizing the first large scale military battles against the Spanish, British and French armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  

May is also the month in which Haitians created a united front against Napoleon Bonaparte.  It was also in this month that Haitians created their own flag-a flag that read "In Unity There Is Strength."  

Haitian Week is also a celebration of the bicentennial anniversary of Haitian independence.  In November 1803, late in the Haitian Revolution, the French surrendered to the Haitians, and Haiti became an independent state shortly thereafter.

"It's the 200th anniversary of the Haitian Revolution," said Admatha Israel, an international relations major that helped organize Haitian Week. "There's a very strong cultural significance behind that because without [it], chances are that slavery wouldn't have been abolished in America until much later."

One of Haitian Week's highlights is a lecture by Historian Dr. Fritz Daguillard, who will speak about Toussaint Louverture.

Daniella Bernard, vice president of the Haitian Student Organization, says that the purpose of Haitian Week is to promote a sense of cultural awareness among students while educating them about the Haitian culture. 

"Hopefully, [students] will get a feel of the Haitian culture and know that we are doing something in the community for Haitians," Bernard said.  "A lot of the times you'll see the bad side of Haitians or Haitian society as far as in the news.  We just want them to know that there are people out there who are positively promoting the Haitian population."

FIU has an abundant population of Haitian and Haitian-American students and is one of the most culturally diverse universities in the country.  

Moncarz says that hopefullly, this event will become an FIU tradition, and encourages all students to enhance their cultural awareness and involvement in school activities by participating.

"This is their month," Moncarz said.  "I think we have a strong contingent of Haitian students and I feel we have to honor those people."

Haitian Week will close on May 15 in the Wolfe University Center, where guest Gina Cunningham will present two documentaries: Haiti in the 1930s and A Tribute to Haitian Poet, Roussan Camille.

"We're trying to let the Haitian people know that we see them, that we recognize them, that we want to help," Israel said.  "That's what school is all about, getting an education and using it to help someone else."

Headline: New health plan provides discounts for students
Author: Jenniffer Sittig/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A discount health care plan with provisions for dental, vision, and pharmacy services was approved in early April by FIU's administration and is now available to all FIU students. 

International students, who are mandated by Federal law to have health insurance, brought concerns for a better, cheaper solution to health care to former Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council President Adrian Carter. A solution arose in late fall, when Student Government Association approved the Co-Health Group Collegiate Plan. 

Initially, the plan was meant to target  international students, who did not have dental and vision care options readily accessible, but it is available to the entire student body.

"In state residents have access to insurance.  Their parents are here, they probably have coverage with their parents," Carter said.  "But the additional bonus of this plan is that it will benefit every student."

The Co-Health Group Collegiate Plan was developed by Co-Health, a company that offers discounts to its members for a variety of medical services.  The Collegiate plan was created specifically in order to meet the financial needs of college and university students, many of whom cannot afford traditional health insurance.

According to the Co-Health Group Collegiate Plan's brochure, the benefits of the plan will enable students to save up to 60 percent when obtaining dental, vision and/or pharmacy services.

There is an annual membership fee for each of the three plans - ranging from $15 to $40.  Students can save more money by enrolling in all three plans - dental, pharmacy and vision, for an annual fee of $62.  Family packages are also available.

The major differences between this plan and traditional health insurance is that savings are more immediate; the brochure promises that students who enroll won't have to worry about age restrictions, deductions and maximums, or filling out claims forms.  Under the plan, students are also able to utilize health services that might not be reimbursable by an insurance company.

"The plan is not insurance," said Ana Sippin, FIU's director of International Student and Scholar Services.  "It is a membership that makes dental, vision and pharmacy services cost effective for students.  It is a reduced cost option."  

 This membership plan does not conflict with any forms of health insurance and there are over 100,000 participating providers nationwide.  It may be used at FIU and throughout the United States.  

"The plan makes dental, vision and pharmacy services one more thing for which we do not have to pay full-price," said junior and Humanities major, Jennifer Samson.  "The plan is necessary because it gives us more options.  The more options the better."

Once enrolled as a single student or family, members can go to any of the professional providers who have agreed to provide their products and services at a discount. 

"The plan received overwhelming support and is a big accomplishment for the Student Government Association," Carter said.

Headline: For Rent
Subheadline: Fraternity rents out house to non-members
Author: Adriana Oliva / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
One of the first things that visitors of FIU notice is the Phi Gamma Delta house, also known as FIJI house, located on the 16th street entrance to FIU, but it has not been easy getting the first on-campus fraternity house up and running full force.

FIJI held its opening ceremonies in September 2001.

One of the major problems that plagued the men of this fraternity was the difficulty of getting members to live in the house.

"When you start something for the first time it takes a while for it to be operational and functional," House Director and Graduate Advisor Ashley O'Kurley said.

The FIJIs had to first overcome some administrative hurdles. By administrative, they do not mean school administration. These hurdles referred to recruiting tenants and how matters of the house itself would be administered.

"One of the biggest hurdles was that essentially, this is an old tradition of having a fraternity house, brought on to a fairly new campus," O'Kurley said. 

For the first six months, rent was at $450, although rent was lowered so that more of the members would be able to afford living in the house. 

"We want to make this affordable and simple compared to having to go out and search for an apartment and having to pay rent, plus utilities," O'Kurley said.

Since the organization was having trouble getting their own members to live in the house, they are now allowing non-members to move in also. 

FIJI members pay, per month, $100 less than non-members, because members pay additional housing fees through membership dues. 

When students first move in, they decide on their own contract. One can live at the house for as little as a month to as long as they want, provided they are an FIU student.

"We make sure that the non-members have the same values that we instill within our fraternity," junior and FIJI member Emil Chruszcz said. 

Friendship, knowledge, service, morality and excellence are the five values that all FIJIs must share and it is what they look for in non-member applicants who wish to live in the house. 

There are currently only 20 tenants in the house, all of whom are members. This still allows room for 14 more tenants, since it was built to house 34 tenants.

With a bit more freedom, the house follows the same basic living rules as campus-housing residents.

"Since there is that sense of ownership, because the house is privately owned, the guys have a little more freedom," O'Kurley said.

Guests, including females, are allowed to stay overnight. Still, tenants cannot take advantage of that privilege. An occasional night or two, as a favor, is permissible.

"There really isn't a rule against girls staying over," senior Marlon Font said. "Most of the guys do not tend to have them sleep over anyway, just out of respect to the fraternity and the rest of the members."

The house tenants are required to maintain an alcohol-free environment. There is not to be one single drop of alcohol located in the house. Alcohol paraphernalia can be found on the second floor of the house, serving as décor for the rooms. 

Each of the rooms is furnished with two bunk beds, two desks and a chest. 

Included in the rent are basic cable, telephone service and high-speed Internet access, as well as all other utilities. 

The FIJI house also has a full kitchen and a small laundry room, which contains two dryers and two washers. 

The members take turns performing various chores around the house. On occasion, there is a big house cleaning for which all members are assigned different sections of the house. 

"The cleaning schedule doesn't always work, but it's a good way for the guys to get used to doing what their parents have always done for them," O'Kurley said.

O'Kurley adds that living in the FIJI house is definitely a learning experience. 

"Living in the house is one of the best things because it is where you make one of the most important relationships you'll carry with you for the rest of your life," O'Kurley said.

The majority of the FIJI members say that despite many of the stereotypical ideas people seem to have, the FIJI house serves as an opportunity to bring all members together, including the ones that do not live in the house. 

Members express their value of aily happenings around the house.

"The house is a place where the brothers can get together, have fun, shoot a game of pool, watch a movie, play monopoly, or just hang out and have a good conversation," sophomore Adrian Heredia said.

Headline: Brand New defies pop-punk standards
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
If you haven't noticed what has been happening in the world of underground punk music, it's time to open your ears. Punk music is changing, or has changed; some say for the better, some for the worst. Everyone knows who Blink-182 is, so I'll use that as an example,  even though it's a pitiful one.

After a few short years of evolution, we have a new music genre on our hands - "Pop-Punk," a combination of extremely catchy, borderline teen bop and punk rock. As the bands keep popping up, it seems as though the "punk" half of pop-punk grows thinner. Many have wrongly confused this phenomenon with another underground music genre, "emo," but trust me, real emo actually sounds absolutely nothing like the cookie-cutter bands of pop-punk.

So now, with an army of NewFoundGlories, SimplePlans and GoodCharlottes, it's becoming more difficult to pick out bands within the genre that are actually making a difference and doing something creative and unique. Brand New proved that it is one of those bands that deserves such attention with their live performance on May 8 at the Social nightclub in Orlando. 

I hate having to group Brand New into specific-crazy genres like pop-punk; they rock in their own way and that should be enough of a definition. The things that stand out about this New York foursome are definitely not subtle. 

Instead of the same, whiny, "I hate my ex-girlfriend," type song-writing style that most pop-punk bands are so comfortable with employing, Brand New explores the use of a sharp and somewhat dark wit.  

This is evident in undeniably loveable "Jude Law and a Semester Abroad" that sings lines such as: "I hope the next boy that you kiss has something terribly contagious on his lips."  

Strengthen such clever writing with hair-raising three-part harmonies and an incredible dynamic and you have, quite possibly, the best new addition to the so-called pop-punk scene.

Listening to their first and only album, Your Favorite Weapon is fun enough, just wait until you experience these guys live. 

After tour-mates the Fight, the Static Lullaby and the Early November gave the crowd an early sweat, Brand New took the stage and opened with a quiet song that quickly burst into the powerful "Jude Law." 

The rest of their set followed with faster, harder and generally more emotional renditions of all their songs. Much to my surprise, Brand New also played "Moshi Moshi" an older tune and a real treat to die-hard fans.

The slow and nostalgic "Soco Amaretto Lim" and the incredibly bitter, hard-driving "Seventy Times 7," were excellent songs to close the show. Brand New takes all the experiences of being "young and in love" as "Soco Amaretto" says and relates it in a way anyone can understand. This was something one could actually see and feel, pouring out with the sweat from lead singer Jesse Lacey and from the crowd's powerful reaction. 

It's a beautiful dance; the bond formed when band and crowd interact and feed off each other for energy. 

All in all, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes Brand New stand apart in genre they've been placed in; perhaps they really don't belong in it after all. Or maybe the said genre simply does not exist.

Headline: X2  ensures future of comic book series
Author: Joe Martel, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For all those movie critics who blatantly say that the original is usually better than the sequels, I say to thee: "Watch X2: X-men United or shut up!" Disproving that theory altogether, X2, the second installment of what I hope will be many X-Men movies, is a bit more advanced than the first one. Like mutants compared to humans, it is a step higher on the evolutionary ladder. I would have to say that director Bryan Singer has truly outdone himself this time. Once again, he has taken the incredibly popular comic book story of mutants and humans fighting for control of the planet or coexistence and made it come alive. I am also relieved to see that Marvel Entertainment hasn't lost its touch. After watching a very disappointing Daredevil earlier this year, I feared X2 would follow in its tragic footsteps. 

I am not exactly certain how much story time has passed from the first movie. Not being clear on the timeline is probably the only big mistake of the movie. Because of this, we're not sure how happy everyone is to see Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) when he walks through the front door. Everyone, that is, except for Cyclops (James Marsden); he's still giving him the evil eye. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) welcomes him back to the school in the hope that he will stay, which may be a good thing considering the current increase in anti-mutant hostility due to recent events. 

The president has been attacked in the oval office by a knife-wielding, teleporting mutant with blue skin and a horned tail: Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). This is when the gang starts to split up. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Storm (Halle Berry) are sent to retrieve blue boy, while Cyclops and the Professor pay a visit to their old friend Magneto (Ian McKellan). Meanwhile, William Stryker (Brian Cox), a mutant-hater and former military scientist, is planning a few surprises for our heroes. First, he kidnaps the professor and messes with his mind. Then, he leads a military raid on his school.

Apparently, he convinced the president it was a training camp for mutant terrorists. That's when the situation starts to get serious, because it eventually forces both the good and bad mutants to work together. 

The siege was the first scene that really caught my attention, because it was the first time we see Wolverine actually kill someone. He never successfully did it in the first one and I was wondering if his character was purposely written in to be less aggressive in the movie than the comic book. 

The fight scenes, the scenery and particularly the special effects were more advanced than that of the first one. I especially like the additional mutant characters such as Nightcrawler, Pyro and Iceman who, this time, plays a more significant role in the story as Rogue's (Anna Paquin) boyfriend. All the actors play their part very well. I almost believed they actually had superpowers. X-Men is an incredible phenomenon that has spanned at least two generations, and after seeing this movie, you can't help but believe it will span many more to come.

Headline: Up-and-coming Muffin boasts unique sound
Author: Phil Chien, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Last weekend at The Alley, Muffin, the hottest new band in South Florida, rocked out in an all night musical bonanza to a crowd of almost 500. Who is Muffin you ask?

Made up of lead singer Jonny Michaels, keyboard/synthesizer specialist Matt Royer, drummer Scott Manor and bassist Henryk Diaz, the foursome from Central Florida has brought a unique folkey-polka rock sound to Miami. 

Their first album, Do You Know The Muffin Man? has been flying off the shelves at some indie music stores across the state. Some of the more popular songs on the record are "Operation: Mullet,"  "Donkey Town" and their show stopper, "Pork Slushy."

Times haven't always been so great for Muffin, however. Just eight months ago, the group was living in their van, desperately trying to find work.

"It was crazy, man," said Manor. "The Aerostar broke down on Alligator Alley and we had to live in a bathroom for six days." The group's luck changed when Matt Royer, master of the synthesizer, got a job cleaning dog cages at the Humane Society. 

"It was our first legit income. It got us a down payment on the apartment and we were able to fix the van," Royer said.

Once they were able to get settled in, they hit the club circuit non-stop playing as much as they could and taking any gig. 

The first few shows did not go well, and the group's new high on life was falling fast.

"It was so horrible, I thought 'Pork Slushy' would get us shows for sure, but no one would book us," a depressed Diaz said.

Lightning struck though when Steve-O Ray, the well-known owner of a nightclub in West Palm Beach, heard the group and wanted them to play. With a surprising crowd of about 150 at their first show, Muffin dominated the stage. 

Another invite led to a show at The Freeze in Ft. Lauderdale, where music producer Richard Jansen of indie lable Rawness Records heard them and offered them a small contract to produce an album. Thus, Do You Know The Muffin Man? was born.

At The Alley last month, the group and its cult following of fans called the show their best yet. 

"It was the best one hands down," said new Muffin fanatic Dave Geisler after the performance. With shows planned around the state this summer, Muffin continues to grow. 

"It's great being a rockstar, but I'll be honest, I do it for the money. Not the fans, not the music, but the money," Michaels was heard saying sarcastically after the show.  

Keep your eyes open for this hilarious and uncommon rock group as they make their way through South Florida this summer.

Headline: Anime-Film stays true to original series; avoids confusing newcomers
Author: Melissa-Nicole Greco, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Fans of the "Cowboy Bebop" series are rejoicing at the release of its feature-length counterpart in the United States this year, but the question remains: Is a newcomer to the series capable of watching the film, understanding the film and even enjoying the film? 

One should know a few basics of the series to grasp some of the important aspects  the film touches upon, especially since the movie takes place somewhere in the midst of the series itself. 

"Cowboy Bebop" is a futuristic story that follows the trials of down-on-their-luck bounty hunters just trying to make enough money for dinner. Each one of the characters has their own problems, issues and quirks that they bring into the mix. For this movie (which      feels like an extended episode) the characters are thrown into an unpredicable mess involving love, death, dreams and bio-terrorism. The necessity for money sets them into motion, investigating nearly 500 casualties caused by an exploding tanker trailer. Yet, each time something is discovered that will help unravel the mystery, the characters finds themselves in something deeper than what was just laid on the surface. 

The underlying themes of the series are predominantly noticeable in this film, but only a few allusions that may be incomprehensible to a casual or first-time viewer to the world of "Cowboy Bebop."  Never once does the movie stray off into a direction not already laid out by the series. The film is a delicious detour into the everyday lives of the characters many have already fallen in love with. 

Additionally, the relationships between the characters are played out very well. The humor that is so often seen in the series comes across as clean and natural, not for a second does anything seem out of the ordinary for this group. 

The movie does an excellent job in quickly setting up the way everyone feels and reacts towards each other, without making the viewer feel left out or confused for a second. 

The animation is up to par and perhaps even more visually appealing than that of the series itself. The opening sequence is an explosion of well-orchestrated fight scenes and witty dialogue. There is hardly any time to think about what was just on screen before the action begins again. The consistent action assists in the feeling that you are watching a two-hour episode instead of a movie.  

The soundtrack that was  constantly praised in the series lives up to its name as  in the movie. The music is the backbone for the onscreen escapades, evoking the feeling of something very hip, jazzy and different.

Not to be overlooked is the fantastic job of English dubbing done for the American release of this film. It remained consistent with the series voice actors and did a wonderful job emulating the Japanese voice actors. It's a jewel among the most recent of dubs. 

Overall the film is a fantastic visit back to "Cowboy Bebop" and a teaser for anyone wishing to get into the series. Nothing about this film hinders a person unfamiliar with the series from watching this movie, and that is the goal of an imported anime film that is achieved here.
