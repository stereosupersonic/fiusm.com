Headline: Science building finished but not yet furnished
Author: Sandra Mateu and Eddith Sevilla / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Despite the fact that it opened last summer, the Marine Sciences building in the Biscayne Bay Campus, is still a work in progress.

Money meant to pay for the odds and ends that came at the end of the construction process, such as blinds, digital projectors, chairs and other things, was used to pay Centex, the construction company that erected the $13 million building, according to Joel Trexler, interim director of the Marine Sciences program and professor of Biological sciences. 

"The construction firm wanted $800,000 more for their work and the University said 'oh no we're going to go down line by line and we're going to work this out,' so they went through a negotiation process and resolved it," Trexler said. 

The resolution closed its budget with the construction company and allowed FIU to completely own the building, but still left the Marine Sciences building $500,000 short, which was suppose to cover some of the furnishing expenses for the building.

But Trexler insists that the shortfall is not something out of the ordinary.

"This $500,000 is not an extreme case. I imagine that there have been buildings that in fact worked out exactly on the original budget but [sometimes] there are some adjustments that occur at the end," said Trexler.

Among the items waiting to be completed, is the seawater system that would allow every floor in the building access to saltwater from the bay. 

"The piping is all there but the pump that pumps the water out of the ocean and into the building has not been purchased yet," said Trexler. 

The building was originally intended to have digital projectors and teleconferencing equipment, which would allow students to take classes at a particular campus while physically being at a different campus, among other things.

"We still need some office furniture meaning desks, chairs and technological appliances," said Clayton Williams, a Marine Sciences graduate assistant.

So how will the building get money to pay for all this?

Trexler says the University is currently going through a process of allocation of funds from internal University sources to basically complete the marine sciences building.

"FIU is operating on very tight budgets these days and so the fact that the building ran over means that the process to kind of tie up these details is taking some time," said Trexler. 

According to Trexler, the way the University allocates money, which comes from the state of Florida and student tuition, is through a "special initiative" process by which programs that desire funds for upgrades such as projectors or to start new initiatives, write and submit a proposal to the Special Initiative Program committee.

But Trexler admits that the needs are greater than the funds.

"The needs of the two campuses exceeds the money and [the Special Initiatives program] has a process that is intended to be very open to evaluate the most pressing needs for the University," he said.

He added that [staff from the Marine Sciences program] is waiting to hear from the program to determine if they will obtain the funds needed to complete the furnishing of the building.

Meanwhile, the Marine Sciences program faces another challenge; finding a permanent director.

Williams says that while Professor Trexler is the interim director, there is a worldwide search for a permanent program director. 

Even though the building lacks office furniture, proper media equipment, a functioning saltwater system and at one point even had a few leaks in some of the plumbing, George Meichel, Marine Sciences building manager, says the experience in a new building has gone fairly smooth.

"Since it is a new building, all the headaches that you run into with an older building, faulty plumbing, bad wiring isn't the case here," said Meichel. 

"Getting set up, getting the faculty moved into their offices, getting set up with the fax machine, the photo copier, getting people's phones and computers hooked up and just kinda moving in, if you will, has basically been the biggest hurdle," he added.

Headline: Model of Health...a wellness column: Excessive alcohol can cause more than just headaches
Author: Sandra Mateu / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Last week as I was checking my email, I had my instant messenger on and my best friend told me the horrible news - one of my cousins had a terrible car accident; my friend and my cousin live in the same city, and my family has been so troubled that they haven't had the time to let us know. 

As you can imagine, I almost fainted. I started asking all sorts of questions:. When was this? Who was in the car? Where was it? How is she? Why did this happen?

It happens to be that she was drinking with two friends in a club. They went into the car to go back home and all of them fell asleep on the way there. The car hit a concrete partition and went upside down. 

She hit herself with the front glass and damaged her face, especially her eyes. The doctors had to reconstruct her eyelids completely, put two plaques and 13 nails in her face. To make matters worse, she was not wearing her seatbelt, which cost her a week in the hospital and surgery, making us go crazy and the risk of not seeing her again.

When something tragic happens to someone close to us, we sometimes find that it's the fault of another, but this isn't one of those cases.

Alcohol is a very powerful and dangerous drug - it's a drug because it changes the way the body works. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), difficulty walking, blurred vision, slurred speech, slowed reaction times and impaired memory clearly show that alcohol affects the brain. 

"When people drink alcohol, it's absorbed into their bloodstream. From there, it affects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which controls virtually all body functions," said the Nemours Foundation, one of the nation's largest group practices for children with ongoing research and education programs.

Being a depressant, alcohol makes every movement and function of your body to be in a slower mode. It can not only affect your ability to drive, but any activity under the influence becomes a danger. Some people die in the most ridiculous ways because of alcohol: in the beach, in a car, in a club or even in the pool.

Some of you may have experienced something similar to my situation - perhaps with someone in your family, a friend or maybe even yourself.

It's one thing to have one or two drinks socially but to go overboard can leave you with more headaches than one, including blackouts and vomiting. 

According to Dr. Pamela Gilbeau Peterson, member of the Acalanes Drug/Alcohol Task Force, the effect of alcohol on the body depends on the person. Whereas some can become happy and talkative, others can become angry, violent and depressed.

"How drinking affects a person depends on age, gender and body size. It depends on how much and how fast a person drinks. It depends on how much food is in the stomach," Peterson said in a brochure entitled "About Alcohol."

If you know someone that has a problem with alcohol, you need to pay attention to it. People cannot stop drinking unless they know and accept they have a problem and want to overcome it. Let them know why is it a problem, how it affects you - and him or her especially - and how you can solve it. 

There are many programs within the community that help with this type of problem. 

If you need any help, you can contact Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. at www.alcoholics-anonymous.org or The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at www.niaaa.nih.gov.

Headline: Review: The Police (Concert)
Author: Ever Cruz /Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It took just three guys - Sting on bass, Andy Summers on guitar and Stewart Copeland on drums - to bring back the noise and power of rock 'n' roll as the smell of beer, sweat and some illegal substance filled the air at Dolphin Stadium July 10. More than 40,000 people packed the place to watch The Police perform.

Throughout the set, the musicians were on point, especially  Copeland who still has that flair and youthfulness of the drummer he was nearly 30 years ago. Summers, on the other hand, was cool, calm and collected, showcasing his guitar craftsmanship. As for the band's leader, Sting, 55, still sounds the same as the young man from the late 70's and early 80's, but he lacked interaction with the audience, almost as if he just wanted the audience to stare in amazement.

It's been 23 years since The Police last toured, and, although Sting has stated this is simply a reunion tour, they are a different band.  

Besides the fact that they are older, they have lost their raw punky attitude and this loss was especially evident in some alterations they did to certain songs during the set.  

The most notable change was heard on numbers such as "Don't Stand So Close To Me," which the whole band or maybe just Sting turned into an even mellower jazzy version of the 1986 re-recording. 

Even the reggae-fueled "Walking On The Moon" was reduced to a quieter, extended version as the marijuana smell filled the air.  When "Roxanne" came blasting through, the audience jumped into frenzy, singing along only to become quiet moments later when the band transformed the song into an extended jazz-like number that toned down the noise.  

The highest points of the show were when the band performed a right-on, excellent "Can't Stand Losing You," an extended "So Lonely," and an out-of-control, scorching "Next To You," which channeled their early punk roots. 

At this point of the concert, the smell of marijuana kept getting stronger, too.  

The band saved their best numbers toward the end: "King of Pain" and their most famous "Every Breath You Take,"  which suffered a bit from the band toning back down.

Overall, the show was good, but it could've been great. A smaller venue such as an arena would've probably made a huge difference for the better, preventing the artist from being too far away from the audience. 

The biggest problems, though, were the alterations of a lot of songs and lack of band-audience interaction.

Maybe the problem is the fact that Sting hasn't played with his old band in so many years, or it's just because he has gone on to have a successful career singing ballads, spiritual and adult contemporary music. 

Maybe he's just lost that rock 'n' roll attitude that made him and The Police one of the greatest artists of all time and that's why the show was just good, not great.

Headline: Vermont's Springfield wins The Simpsons Movie premiere
Author: John Curran / AP Wire
&nbsp;
Maybe it was the pink doughnut. Maybe it was the clever homemade video, or small-town charm.

Maybe Homer just figured it was time to go green.

Whatever the reason, this much is true: Tiny Springfield, Vt., beat out 13 other like-named cities Tuesday for the right to host the premiere of The Simpsons Movie, winning an online poll it wasn't even invited to participate in.

On July 21, the town's 100-seat movie theater will play host to the movie, which opens July 27.

"Ninety-three hundred people, and we won," said an exultant Town Manager Bob Forguites. "I think it's pretty neat, myself."

Springfields in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon and Tennessee also made bids, submitting videos meant to playfully connect their cities to the fictional Springfield in "The Simpsons."

Competition was fierce: Massachusetts got U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, the inspiration behind the voice of Mayor Quimby on "The Simpsons," to appear in its entry.

"Just think," Kennedy said. "You'll even be able to enjoy some real chowdah."

Vermont's Springfield, which has a bowling alley, a pub, a prison and a nuclear power plant just down the road, wasn't initially part of the contest, but a local Chamber of Commerce executive appealed to movie producer 20th Century Fox and the race was on.

The town submitted a video shot by a 17-year-old volunteer cameraman showing buildings with "Springfield" in them and featuring Homer, played by a Burlington talk-show host,running through town chasing a big, pink, rolling doughnut.

Eventually, a mob chases him into a movie theater.

The video was posted on the contest Web site along with the other entries. By midnight Monday, the deadline, 109,582 votes were cast.

Vermont got 15,367, edging out Springfield, Ill., which drew 14,634.

Florida's Springfield got the lowest vote total, 1,386.

"We're so excited," says Patricia Chaffee, vice president of the Springfield Regional Chamber of Commerce. "We came in at the last minute, and for us to win, we feel like the underdogs, which makes this so big and so great for us."

Gov. Jim Douglas congratulated the town.

"This is an exciting, exhilarating moment for Vermonters," he said. "Perhaps more importantly, it proves there's really nothing a giant doughnut can't do. To all the other Springfields, I say 'Don't have a cow, man.'"

The mayor of Springfield, Illinois, the state's capital city, took the loss like a man, not a cow.

"We knew all along that it would be a tough battle against the other cities who claim a relationship with the television program," said Timothy Davlin. "We in Springfield, Illinois, have enjoyed the notoriety from this exercise and hope that it translates into more people visiting Springfield looking for the Abraham Lincoln sites and the Simpsons."

Springfield, Ore., hoped it had an in because "Simpsons" creator Matt Groening is from Portland, the state's largest city, and many of the show's landmarks are named after streets in Portland. 

It noted in its video that "the only Springfield Groening passed through on his way to Hollywood was in Oregon."

According to USA Today, which ran the vote on its Web site, the 13 other Springfields that participated will be given small screenings of their own the night before the movie opens nationwide July 27.

Headline: Review: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Movie)
Subheadline: Cinematic Magic: Phoenix reveals Potter's dark side
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
It was either "abracadabra" or "hocus pocus," but the bottom line is that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is pure magic in theatres.

Critics of the previous film complained that too much had been cut from the book to the screenplay, but hardcore fans of the book series need not fear - almost everything from the book managed to get into the movie; even the characteristics of fan favorite spells were more like their book counterparts.    

Speaking of keeping things similar to the books, there were two delightful characters added that seemed like they were pulled straight from the pages: the maniacal Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and the cookey but lovable Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). For a second, I thought I was reading the books again when I saw these characters on screen. Ordinarily, when new characters are added to such a large pool of already established ones, it's difficult for viewers to really get to know them. With these two, you were either hating them or loving them in just a few seconds - I'll think twice about annoying any old woman who wears pink after watching this movie.

Sadly though, Lynch did not get nearly as much screen time as she should have. It just happened that many of the extra scenes cut from the book to save time in the movie involved Lovegood. Luckily, her character's essence really made it to the big screen.

For the rest of the cast, their performances were pretty similar to the last four films even though Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Potter, did have to try a lot of things he hasn't in the past such as having night terrors. Perhaps it was his acting choice, but his painful writhing was pretty painful to watch and was borderline comical. 

However, credit must be given to Radcliffe for his display of Harry's growth and maturity since last we saw him. His displays of anger were jaunting, but really helped exhibit that critical "the world is against me" teenage angst that was so evident in the book.

Plotwise, this was definitely the darkest of the series and some parts bordered demented, including one scene where the characters write lines that were then carved into their hands by a magic pen. I can handle characters being killed off, but a pen carving what you write into your hand - that's just eerie.

Even though the dark undertones complement the film, you just won't find any big surprises, though. Everyone has known who dies and who lives for more than four years because of the books, even if seeing the deaths on screen is so much fun.

Which brings me to the big let down of the film: the climactic battle between Lord Voldemort and Albus Dumbledore. By the end of the movie, if you read the book, you're on the edge of your seat just waiting for the fight to start, but when it finally happens, it's over in five minutes.

I would have preferred character development time to be cut in order for the fight scene to be as great as it was in the book. The scene still gave me goosebumps, but had it been everything it could have been, it would have made the movie way more enjoyable.

Nevertheless, this is a great movie. There are some great one-liners that are sure to crack you up and the special effects are top notch although they really don't kick in until the end of the movie. Best of all, fans won't cringe over things being cut as they did last time; you really don't notice what was cut, so Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is sure to entertain even if you haven't read any of the books - though it couldn't hurt to do so.

Headline: University joins 'green' initiative
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Within FIU's blue and gold, a little green seems to be leaving its mark.

With President Modesto A. Maidique's recent signing of the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, FIU has joined more than 300 American colleges and universities in an attempt to create a more sustainable planet by starting on their own campuses. 

The commitment targets colleges and universities because of the "unique responsibility" institutions of higher learning have in serving as role models for the community and to train future generations to be more climate-conscious, according to the ACUPCC web site.  

Presidents who sign the commitment pledge to tackle global warming by forming ways to limit greenhouse gas emissions and by providing research and educational opportunities that address the state of the earth's climate.

Vivian Sanchez, the University's Chief Financial Officer and senior vice president of the Division of Business and Finance, said that FIU joined the alliance because it allowed each university to address its impact on the environment in a unique way.

"The President's climate commitment gave us all the flexibility in the world," Sanchez said. 

Another selling point may have been that FIU includes "respect for the environment" in its values statement, said FIU alumna Cristela Guerra, who, as former communications intern at Sanchez' office, did research on the commitment before FIU joined the alliance.

As a signatory, FIU will have to complete an investigation within one year on the impact that the institution is currently having on the environment. 

The commitment takes into consideration several factors contributing to our planet's degradation, including the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released from electricity and automobiles, the conservation and quality of water and the recycling program in place.  

"[The President's climate commitment] makes us look at the University as a whole," Sanchez said.

Also, within two years, FIU must develop "an action plan for becoming climate neutral" according to the ACUPCC web site. This plan should include an estimated date for becoming climate neutral, interim goals until neutrality is reached, integration of topics such as climate sustainability in the curriculum, climate-based research and standards for tracking progress toward environmental goals.

FIU already has some environmentally friendly practices in place such as motion-detectors on lights to save energy, retention ponds and reclaimed water systems for irrigation and a campus-wide recycling program, Maidique said in an e-mail. 

According to Victor Citarella, associate vice president of facilities management, FIU has been consistently ranked number two or above in Florida's annual evaluations for energy efficiency in public buildings.

"...a record we [FIU and facilities management] are very proud of achieving on a regular basis," he said in an e-mail interview. 

The ACUPCC also requires that FIU meets the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Silver standard - known as LEED certification - or equivalent, in all new construction projects approved for 2008-2009.

LEED is a rating system for "green" buildings that certifies building projects based on five areas: water savings, energy efficiency, sustainable site development - which considers possible erosion as a result of construction or the pollution of air due to dust or particulate matter, - materials selection  such as those that do not generate excessive waste and indoor environmental quality that looks at ventilation and limits smoking in or around buildings.

According to Sanchez, FIU's geographic location makes some LEED standards difficult or impractical to abide by. But just because new construction isn't LEED certified, it doesn't mean it is not more environmentally friendly, Sanchez said.

Citarella says that it is estimated that these new standards will increase construction costs by five percent. The University plans to pay for the increase by raising budget requests for state funds by the same amount. 	

Citarella also said that current construction, such as the new football stadium and medical school, do not have to abide by these standards because of the additional costs involved in applying these new standards. 

Much has to be decided before students will really know how the new commitment will affect them. Visiting FIU while taking summer classes, University of Florida sophomores Brittany Marshall and Samantha Arzillo think that FIU could move toward sustainability by creating a bike lane on campus, as well as by providing more affordable housing so students do not have to commute. 

According to Guerra, FIU may look into things such as more shuttle services or carpool incentives, but nothing is certain yet.

FIU NEWS:
Transportation program takes students from parking garages to classes

Starting in the Fall semester, a new transportation program referred to as Panther Safety Aid, or PSA, will begin offering students the chance to park anywhere at University Park and be driven to and from buildings on the opposite side of campus.  The system, which will be student-operated and is made up of five golf carts, will help alleviate the parking situation on campus and increase student safety at night.

PSA was organized by the Student Government Association and will be founded from a $20,000 grant approved July 6 by Student Affairs and Undergraduate Vice-President Rosa Jones. The funds were allocated from the Student Affairs Accumulated Cash Balance, which is made up of the past unused funds available to all student organizations on campus.  



NATIONAL NEWS:
House passes $19 billion cut in subsidies to student lenders, increases Pell grants.  

A bill approved by the U.S. House of Representatives July 11 may provide some relief for college students. 

The new bill, which promises to help with the escalating costs of higher education, would cut $19 billion in federal subsidies to student lenders over five years. The bill would also increase maximum Pell grants and cut interest rates in half on federally backed loans.

The bill reduces the share the government would guarantee in the event of student default and provides loan forgiveness in the amount of $5,000 for police, firefighters, prosecutors and other public servants. Public servants would be granted a complete release from student loans for public servants after 10 years, and complete forgiveness of federal student loans after 20 years for economic hardship.

President George W. Bush has threatened a veto the loan-forgiveness provisions of the bill, but has proposed cutting government subsidies to lenders by $16 billion and increasing the size of Pell grants. The Senate is expected to pass legislation that would reduce these subsidies by $18.3 billion, while increasing the Pell grant.

Headline: STATE UNIVERSITIES' BUDGETS CUT: FIU slated to lose between 4 and 10 percent of overall budget
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Responding to Governor Charlie Crist's rejection of a 5 percent tuition increase in Florida's 11 public universities and his decision June 27 to limit tuition increases to only three public universities (Florida State University, University of Florida and University of South Florida), the Board of Governors has asked universities to prepare for budget cuts between 4 and 10 percent. 

The board has also voted to challenge Crist and the legislation with a 5 percent tuition increase by January 2008 and decided to freeze freshman enrollment by January as well.

As a result, the board joined in a lawsuit with former U.S. Senator Bob Graham against Crist last week. The goal of the suit is to give sole power of regulating tuition to the Board of Governors. FIU Faculty Senate Chair Bruce Hauptli and history professor Howard Rock have also joined the lawsuit against Crist. 

"This is a critical issue for higher education and the future of Florida's families," Graham said to The Miami Herald. "I don't think this is going to make a difference in the next few months. It will make a difference in the next generation."

Hauptli agrees with Graham.

"It is the Board of Governors [that] should set tuition," Hauptli said.

According to Hauptli, if the lawsuit is successful, FIU could see tuition increase as early as Spring 2008. 

"If there is not enough money, things will have to be shut down," he said. 

In a presentation made by Mark Rosenberg to the BOG, chancellor of the state university system of Florida and former FIU provost said that in a worse case scenario, the 4 percent cut could result in the loss of 17,000 students - equivalent to the University of North Florida. A 10 percent decrease would result in the loss of 42,000 students - equivalent to the size of FIU. There have been no plans or discussions to close either university. 

According to a press release on July 12, a 4 percent cut to FIU's budget is equivalent to all the money received this year to partially fund 1,100 additional full-time students.

FIU is preparing by identifying a minimum budget cut of $9.4 million of its $231 million recurring state appropriation. If the budget cut goes as high as 10 percent, the budget would have to be reduced by $23 million. Overall, FIU's yearly budget is roughly $800 million, the press release said. 

Although some universities, such as UF, responded by freezing faculty hiring, FIU President Modesto A. Maidique said in a press release issued July 13 that FIU will freeze administration and non-faculty hiring instead, and cut from different 'non-core expenses' such as employee raises. 

"[The University] is only going to approve hiring that is considered a need, not a want," said Marbely Hernandez, Student Government Council president. "It's going to be more on need-based." 

The BOG also decided to freeze freshman enrollment as of Spring 2008 to help curtail spending. This means that universities will not be able to enroll more freshmen than they did last year. 

According to Hernandez, it is the enrollment freeze that will affect SGA. Also, all of SGA's funds come from the A&S fees from student registration. Less students means less funds for SGA, said Hernandez..

In 1997, FIU had 16,824 full time students enrolled with a state expenditure of $10,146 per student. FIU is expecting 25,161 full time students to be enrolled this Fall semester, with a state expenditure of $9,430 per student.

"After years of cuts, we are at the breaking point. In order to remain true to our educational mission and in line with our commitment to quality, we are going to have to turn away students," Maidique said in the same press release.

Maidique added that he is committed to making sure the cuts do not further erode the quality of education at FIU and that he still envisions FIU becoming one of the top ten urban research universities in the country.

"Although FIU will not be receiving any additional money, we are determined to meet operating expenses," Maidique said in the press release. "Therefore, to meet these obligations we will need to immediately identify savings within our core budget." 

In an interview conducted by The Beacon on July 3, days before these decisions were made, Maidique said that there are other ways to help offset rising costs other than tuition increases, and they involve fundraising and donations. 

"We would need to raise a billion dollars," Maidique said,

To identify viable budget solutions, Maidique will appoint by next week a budget stabilization task force led by senior vice president and Chief  Financial Officer Vivian Sanchez. 

The task force will consist of a college dean, a senior administrator, a representative from the faculty and a student representative from both campuses, Sanchez said. 

According to Sanchez, if the budget cut is within the 4 percent range, operations at FIU would be affected minimally, but if the worse case scenario of a 10 percent budget cut does happen, the impact would be felt. 

However, student services will not be affected by the budget cuts. 

"This has been coming for a while," Sanchez said. "We haven't received full funding for student enrollment since I've been here."  

Sanchez also said that the amount of funds FIU requested versus the amount actually received for enrollment in the last three years has been deferred by $13 million. 

Once the task force has been assembled and knows the exact amount of the budget cuts (which will be after the state budgeting forecast on Aug. 1), the task force will determine what needs to be changed.

Student Programming Council President Sophia Del Zoppo says the budget cuts could change the way events are planned this year, and that if 10 percent of SPC's budget were cut, it would likely result in many of the smaller SPC events being cancelled.

"We're trying to do bigger and better," Del Zoppo said. "The big events would have priority over our smaller events."

Sanchez urged University departments and divisions not to panic. 

"Once you go into hysteria you may make some decisions you will regret later," Sanchez said. "Which is why I am a fan of this task force. A methodology will be established whereby thoughtful analysis and good decisions can be made."

Following a series of burglaries at the Engineering and Computer Science building between June 1-6, a police report was filed June 14 describing a master key as missing. Dona Dorsett  reported to police that between June 4 and 13, the master key, which she holds, was replaced with another key that belonged to a former FIU employee. It is unknown if that employee ever turned in the key when he or she left, or if was in possession of the key before it was involved in this case. The master key is still missing and the locks have yet to be changed.

Headline: FIU medical center needed
Author: Kevin Castro / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU is a business; like all businesses its goal is to make a profit, and since it is also a public university it has an obligation to provide an education to its clients. 

For the 07-08 Fiscal Year, FIU had a $779.9 million in revenue and a total of $657.6 million in expenses, earning $19.8 million in net assets. That is a substantial expansion.

The University also receives an estimated $248.5 million in state funding which is allocated to several of FIU's expenses. It has held $11.9 million of reserves as of the 06-07 fiscal year for future projects such as a parking garage, housing,  parking and the Chapman graduate school.

FIU currently utilizes every dollar the State of Florida grants us, but instead we should save a percentage of the funding in order to commit the opening of a new public hospital, (i.e., Jackson Memorial). 

Having a medical facility would serve as a major benefit to the University and its students.  When construction began in 1916 Jackson cost $150,000, worth today $2,842,105. 

Since FIU received $33.5 million more than the 06-07 Fiscal Year they can easily afford the construction of the first of many buildings that will compromise a new hospital.

With the hospital, FIU should finally construct the highly anticipated medical school that when finished will attract students from all over and increase revenue. 

It's also a notable commodity for commuters, the majority of students that attend FIU, since it gives opportunities to many who live in Miami and do not wish to be robbed by the Umiversity of  Miami's sky-scraping tuition.

Not only will the new hospital commit itself to the medical needs of the citizens of Miami, but it will also allow FIU's graduates to attend the hospital as residents. 

The opening of a new hospital will also increase revenue exponentially, as medical bills are Olympian in nature. For example, Jackson Memorial reported revenue of $1,427,060,847 and expenses totaling $1,416,211,537. That is a net profit of $10,849,310.

Jackson Memorial faced financial tribulations in the 1940's causing the city to pass a $2.5 million hospital improvement bond; that is $21,132,075.47 in today's market.

It later on received a $115 million bond for allocated improvements and new construction. Though FIU would require funding from the City of Miami, it wouldn't be hard to imagine the City of Miami approving such an arrangement since it is beneficial for the City to allot funding for a hospital.

FIU's hospital will not be the only medical center providing health care, a medical school can treat thousands of patients annually. 

UM's Miller School of Medicine currently treats over 1 million patients annually, so it provides needed health care to this community but also grants our students hands-on medical experience. 

The University of Miami has had their medical school since 1952 and since then has expanded the Schools of Medicine's research community to over 12 research institutes, nine PhD programs, and nine facilities.

The addition of a medical school and public hospital will benefit this ever-growing metropolis with more health care services and aid in the training of future health care practitioners, as well as generate a   massive profit.

Headline: LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Coca-Cola not responsible for questionable conduct in Colombia
Author: Diana Garza Ciarlante / Director of Public Affairs Coca-Cola North America   
&nbsp;
The Coca-Cola Co. would be remiss if we did not respond to questions regarding our business practices in Colombia.

Just because an allegation is repeated over and over again does not make it true. 

The allegations that have been waged by professional activist organizations suggesting complicity in violence and intimidation against union workers in Colombia are absolutely false. The Coca-Cola system employs 2,000 people in Colombia directly, but generates approximately 8,000 jobs in the country. 

We treat all of our employees fairly and respect their right to organize.

Our Colombian bottling partners, including the largest, Coca-Cola FEMSA, have collective bargaining agreements in place with a number of unions in Colombia. 

Our Colombian bottling partners work with unions and the government to provide emergency cell phones, transportation to and from work, secure housing, and many other measures. 

More than 31 percent of Coca-Cola Colombian bottler employees belong to unions, only 4 percent of Colombians can claim to be represented by a labor organization. 

Judicial inquiries by the Colombian Court and the Colombian Attorney General found no evidence to support the allegations that bottler management conspired to intimidate or threaten trade unionists.  

These allegations were the thrust of a lawsuit filed in 2001 against The Coca-Cola Company in a U.S. District Court in Miami; the Company was dismissed as a defendant.  

On September 29, 2006 the court issued a decision to dismiss the two Coca-Cola bottlers in Colombia from all remaining cases as well.

The International Labor Organization (ILO), a specialized multilateral organization within the United Nations which is responsible for establishing international labor standards, has agreed to conduct an independent and impartial investigation and evaluation of the labor relations and workers' rights practices of Coca-Cola bottlers in Colombia. 

With the ILO assessment, we are fulfilling our commitment to an independent, impartial third-party investigation and evaluation of our system's labor relations and workers' rights practices in Colombia.

Headline: Editorial: University funding issues to affect current and future students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Florida's public universities may become less public with a recent decision by the Florida Board of Governors, freezing freshmen enrollment.

Though the BOG decision is in the best interest of Florida's public universities, it will also be depriving thousands of qualified students from receiving a higher education.

The Universities must now stress the importance of quality over quantity to its highest degree; however, with a fixed number of enrollment the opportunity for many students to be accepted will become seriously competitive. 

Public universities must have the ability to offer an education to all who are deserving and willing. 

Unfortunately, the State has not funded public universities adequately for the past six years. Furthermore, these Universities will now be faced with a 4 to 10 percent budget cut as well which will be effective as early as August first. 

Fortunatly, the problem has been temporarily bandaged.  What once seemed like an easy solution  to the problem has now evolved into a major crisis that will affect the lives of current and future students, as well as many others.

In addition to the enrollment issue, Florida's governor Charlie Crist approved for up to a 5 percent tuition increase for Florida's three largest public universities- University of Florida, Florida State University, and University of South Florida. 

This will serve as a  double edged sword for him because there will be negative consequences of any decision made. 

However, these universities already receive the highest amount of funding and it would be more beneficial for universities such as FIU to have a tuition increase. 

This University is still in need of better classroom equipment and more faculty,  and should be under continuous growth and development.

The Florida legislature's failure to realize lack of funds that public universities have is a problem will affect not only students now, but for many more years to come. It will stay that way until the they start appropriating the necessary amount of funds to the universities that our children will be attending in the future.

Headline: MAKING THE JUMP: Men's basketball adds more size, international talent
Author: Darren Collette / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Junior Badara N'Diaye measures in at nearly 7 feet (6 feet 11 inches officially) and comes to FIU by way of a transfer from Southeastern Iowa Community College. Next season, when he takes the court with fellow FIU giant Russell Hicks, the FIU basketball team will have one of the tallest frontcourts in NCAA basketball.   

N'Diaye, 23, is an international business major with a 3.6 GPA. He came to America via a nine hour plane ride, arrived at Southeastern Iowa Community College in 2001 speaking no English, but prepared to work hard to develop his skills as a basketball player. 

"I went over there not knowing any English and it was hard at the beginning not having any friends. [It was not easy} - having to build a social life again - but I met some very nice people," said N'Diaye.

He lived with a local family who took him in, and he said they treated him like a son. After playing at Iowa for two seasons, N'Diaye averaged four points and four rebounds playing junior college basketball with the Blackhawks under head couch Tim Walsh.

Born in Saint-Louis, Senegal, he played soccer until he was 14-years-old because he had grown so tall. He became so tall his friends and family persuaded him to take up basketball. N'Diaye would heed the advice of those around him, and his coaches noticed his quick speed and athleticism on the court.

In Senegal, N'Diaye has a large family that includes three younger sisters and two younger brothers. His big break came when FIU basketball head coach Sergio Rouco came to Senegal to scout for talent.

Rouco spoke to him about his prospects as a college basketball player and recommended that N'Diaye come to America to develop his game. N'Diaye says his parents are open minded people and when he had the opportunity to come to America they embraced it.

It was time for N'Diaye to move up to the next level, so he chose Iowa Community College, mainly due to Rouco's influence. Rouco also thought it to be a good idea if N'Diyae matured physically in Iowa before transferring to FIU.

"I was recruited by coach Rouco. He saw me during a tournament, talked to me and I was interested. There were other colleges, but I was more interested in FIU," N'Diaye said. 

He also decided to transfer for a change of scenery. 

"Since I was up north before, I thought I would try the south," he said.

Rouco compares N'Diaye's style of play to that of Joakim Noah, who led the University of Florida Gators to consecutive national championships prior to being drafted ninth overall by the Chicago Bulls in last months NBA draft. This coming season couch Rouco has said he will play N'Diaye alongside Hicks and make the most use out of the tall line up. Between the two of them FIU will have a substantial size advantage and will look to dominate the paint.

N'Diaye's teammates recognize that playing alongside a player of his size and versatile athletic ability is a rare opportunity. The tallest player on last year's roster was freshman Nikola Gacesa, who stands at 6 feet 9 inches.   

"He brings a big presence inside. He's athletic; that's something we have been missing for a couple of years at least," said senior point guard Michael James. "He has a good feel for the game. He can pass and step out and hit the little 15 footer. He can [also] rebound and block shots. He brings a variety of stuff to our team. I think he will be a good asset."

This seven feet tall native of Senegal adds yet another country to a team with players from places all over the world. The basketball team has players from Argentina, Canada, Puerto Rica, Cameroon and Serbia.

N'Diaye's cultural diversity extends to the languages he knows: English, French and Wolof. 

Junior forward Alex Galindo is excited to have N'Diaye on the team.

"We've got an international team. We are excited to learn from Badara's culture and he is excited to learn from us."

Headline: Commentary: Reverence toward coaches undeserved
Author: Chris Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Whenever Bill Belichick is being proclaimed the greatest football guru in the game and put high upon that coaching pedestal the media has created, his time before Tom Brady always seems to be forgotten.

Over the same time span, a certain mustached former Dolphins coach that was chased out of town with pitchforks and torches had nearly more than a season's worth of victories than that brilliant head coach of the Patriots. 

Phil Jackson, holder of nine rings, conveniently won them all when he had two of the five greatest NBA players of all-time in their prime. 

What happens when you have Kwame Brown instead of Shaq? Good for a seven seed and a quick playoff exit for a couple of years. 

Mike Hargrove, former coach of the Seattle Mariners, recently announced he would be retiring in the midst of an eight game winning streak because "his heart wasn't in the game anymore." It was met with respect from insiders and fans alike.

Now imagine Ichiro Suzuki, in the middle of an eight game winning streak, announcing his retirement because he has lost his passion for the game. 

An ovation from the people? 

Not quite. 

In fact, chalk him up as the biggest sports villain this side of Barry Bonds.

Simply put, coaching is the most over glorified position in all of professional sports, a creation of the media and fans searching for the same romanticism we see in the movies and hear about from past decades of the fearless leader, directing his team like a general in war to victory.

In sports, fans are quick to give intangible qualities when they are unable to explain certain championships. Players argue while mired in a losing season, and we call it a lack of chemistry. 

The Heat are swept in the first round; suddenly they are too old, despite being only ten months removed from a championship and the eventual champions, the Spurs, having the oldest team in the league. Pat Riley didn't resign seven days before the 2004 season started because he suddenly forgot how to coach. It's just a whole lot easier when you have Magic, Kareem, and James Worthy instead of Caron Butler and Eddie Jones.

Even worse is the infatuation with disciplinarians to the point where people think that Rod Marinelli taking the sofas out of the players lounge is meant to toughen up the athletes when the team is exactly what they are, a 3-13 team. These athletes are professionals. They did not become who they are without having that burning competitiveness inside them to be the best, with or without an obnoxious coach screaming in their face. 

It's an illusion fans embrace, once again going after those magical qualities that are nonexistent. Part of the irony in professional sports is that the coach always makes five to ten times more than the general managers, who actually put the talent in uniform. Scott Pioli is the most valuable man in the NFL, and he should be the one given credit for building Bilichick his masterpiece, but for whatever reason, he is always overlooked. 

Coaching also gives a perfect scapegoat for a team's problems when an omnipotent owner surveys his realm and says that things must change. Firing one coach and ushering in another always gets the fans excited. You want to know why your team lost 90 games, Marlins management? Not because Jack McKeon forgot how to coach. The year he won the championship he couldn't remember his player's names and would take afternoon naps in the sixth inning. It's because your players stunk. 

And that's what it comes down to. For all the coaching press conferences, for all the Sportscenter segments breaking down why the new coach will make his team a contender, all the preaching and books, it comes down to the players. It's what sports has always been and will always be about, and we must be careful never to forget that winning comes down to the players.

Headline: Track runner discovers potential late in career
Author: Luca Messina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Some athletes discover the desire and motivation to strive for the best at a young age. But others, like junior Naim Yisrael, discover that desire at a later stage in life.

Yisrael, the current record holder of FIU's 400 meter hurdles, grew up in the urban area of Jacksonville, FL. 

Dating back to middle school, she began running as a hobby. She attended Terry Parker High School where she attempted to excel in the classroom while trying to participate in extra curricular activities. 

She never thought running would be anything more than a diversion she could partake in outside of her academic studies. 

"When I first started running track back in seventh grade, it was nothing more than an extracurricular activity to me," said Yisrael. "I really just enjoyed the hobby of running. To me, it was sort of a stress reliever." 

The motivation and drive to run developed during the summer going into her sophomore year at Terry Park. That was when she began to entertain the possibility of seriously honing her running skills. 

"My coach started telling me that I could take my talents to the next level," Yisrael said.

 She says that her drive started to dramatically increase during this time. At the same time, her accomplishments were increasing in prestige as she went on to place first in a city competition for the 300 meter hurdles and would continue to achieve success, finishing in second place, respectively, for her junior and senior years. 

While this success was both satisfying and noteworthy to her, she mentioned that her senior year was when she decided she would be competing at the next level.

 "I just wanted to see where everything would go and I realized that I will definitely be competing in college track," she said.

Her parents weren't necessarily strong advocates of track and field but rather of her own personal dreams and desires. 

"They basically said, 'do what you like and whatever makes you happy.'" 

She says she never assigned a set of expectations for herself, but she let her passion for the sport improve her athletic abilities. 

After rejecting offers from other schools such as University of Jacksonville, University of South Florida and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Yisrael decided on FIU and underwent another transitional stage as her past successes were not repeated.

 "I stuck with it but didn't do anything worth noting," Yisrael said.

 The turning point in her collegiate career was when FIU hired hurdles specialist coach, Eric Campbell last year. 

The new coach, who has been a past volunteer, helped Yisrael strengthen her talents on a more one-on-one basis, which was something that current coach Steve Rubin wasn't able to accomplish due to his position as a general coach.

 "Coach Rubin had everyone to coach; therefore, he couldn't always train just me alone," Yisrael said. "Coach Campbell was specialized in my area so I was able to strengthen my talent much better."

Following this change, the results became evident at the collegiate level as Yisrael began lowering her time dramatically. Starting from the end of sophomore year, her time for the 400 meters was 60 seconds. 

After this year's national competition, her current time is at a school all-time low of 56.98 seconds - placing sixth in national competition. The girl who began running sparingly as a seventh grader, had reached a new stratosphere in her athletic career. 	

Despite her improvement, Yisrael looks forward to expanding her horizons even more as she hopes to crack the Olympic roster in the qualifying trials, which take place on June of 2008 and has even pondered pursuing track as a career.

"I never thought that it would be like this, but I now know and have proven that I can run  with the best".

If her track career doesn't work out, she is currently majoring in hospitality management and definitely wouldn't mind pursuing a career in that field. 

"I really like the hospitality industry and I could really see myself running a hotel someday."

Yisrael says that sometimes talents are hidden, and when these talents are discovered, they not only become a passion but can lead to endless opportunities in the scope of life. Her hobby turned into a passion, and she hopes running will transport her to success.

"Sky is the limit."

Headline: New softball head coach acquired from Houston
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU's new women's softball coach, Beth McClendon, filled the last vacant head coaching position on July 12, 2007. 

McClendon's track record includes a five year tenure at the University of Houston where she helped take the Cougars to two NCAA tournament appearances by coaching one of the best ranked pitching staff's in the nation. 

"We are very excited to have someone with such an outstanding coaching and playing background to lead our program," said Athletic Director Pete Garcia in a press release.

In addition to winning the Conference USA championship, the Cougars' pitching staff ranked 15th nationally in ERA (1.66), which led the team to a 44-18 record. 

McClendon's worked as a recruiting coordinator, and she recruited two time C-USA Pitcher of the Year, Angel Shamblin.

McClendon's coaching career began as an assistant at Stetson University from 2000-2002. The Hatters' pitching staff also excelled as her pitchers set school records in wins, shutouts, strikeouts and strikeouts per seven innings.

The Golden Panther's softball program recorded a 22-35 record in 2007. 

McClendon's history of building strong pitching staffs is attributed to her success as a pitcher at the University of Florida. She was as four-year letter winner, who still holds the Gators' record for wins with 60. She excelled on the field and mirrored her success academically.

"I am happy to return home to the state of Florida and I'm excited to be part of a growing athletic program.  The future is bright for FIU softball," McClendon said in a press release.
