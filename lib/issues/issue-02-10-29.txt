Headline: Point-Counterpoint: McBride
Subheadline: McBride offers fresh ideas, realistic solutions; Bush fails to keep promises 
Author: Saudy Peña / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The only two questions voters should be asking themselves at the polls today are: have things improved since Jeb Bush was elected four years ago? And is he worthy of re-election as governor of Florida?

I think in both cases the answer is a firm no. 

I'm putting my vote in for the man who claims to "look out for the little guy," Bill McBride. 

Sure, he is inexperienced in the political world,  (Bush was as well), but as a respected business and civic leader, he certainly has the potential to bring about an active, new leadership that will improve the conditions created under the failing leadership of Bush. 	

McBride, the plain-spoken, former Marine turned lawyer, has a stronger record of community service than Bush had when first elected. 

With fresh energy, ideas, and more importantly, realistic solutions to Florida's problems, there is no doubt that Floridians should give his vision a chance.

Yes, Bush has taken steps forward in a few areas, (recently updating the state's growth management act), but his overall record has been unsatisfactory.

What happened to all the promises Bush made? In education especially, we have been severely let down. 

An issue that is of concern to college students, such as myself, is how ugly, pork-barrel politics have plagued our once respected state university system under Bush.  He has managed to reduce the pursuit of higher education to how much influence quarreling institutions can have in the legislature.

And in other areas, practically every national indicator reveals that the quality of Florida's schools have been embarrassingly poor.

Throughout his term, SAT scores, teachers' salaries, high school graduation rates and per-student spending, have all declined.

The man who once campaigned as "education governor" has clearly proven that he cannot deliver.

McBride on the other hand, has a long, detailed plan that will deal heavily with the education predicament.

It is based on a 50-cents-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes, (the only tax raise McBride advocates), and would help pay for teacher salary increases and class-size reduction in grades K-12. 

Also, it would provide for more funding to remedial programs, pre-kindergarten programs, and building new schools.

Similarly, on critical environmental and economic issues, Bush has promised a lot and delivered little.

McBride's new plans in this area are straight-forward and realistic, outlining a clear direction for improving the environment and Floridians' quality of life. 

While Bush boasts about his environmental record, organizations such as Sierra Club and the Florida League of Conservation Voters have endorsed McBride. 

Unlike Bush's short-sighted approaches, McBride wants to protect Florida's future by making several, progressive proposals, some of which are his intentions to make Smart Growth a priority, restore the Everglades via the judgment of independent science reviews as opposed to politics, make water management a top priority and permanently protect Florida's coastlines from offshore drilling. 

A man who worked his way through college through several part-time jobs (I'm sure many of us can relate) understands what hard work is.

Jeb Bush has been given his chance to better the state of Florida and, well, he has blown it – do we really need to give him a second try?

Florida cannot allow another four years of his kind of leadership. From giving tax breaks to the rich to the worsening conditions of DCF, I think we have seen the best the man can do. The state deserves better. 

I think Mr. McBride might just be able to come through where Bush left us empty-handed.

Headline: Gubernatorial candidates fail to impress
Author: Eyder Peralta
&nbsp;
I thought this gubernatorial election was going to be all about Janet's red pick-up truck versus the country club Jeb hangs out at. Instead, we all got hammered with a poor-sap of a first-time politician with floppy hair and a southern accent that makes President Bush sound like Hugh Grant. And get this, I'm a democrat – hardcore, unflinching democrat – but the truth is, we got jibbed with this Democratic nominee.

Yes, politics right now are at a standstill – there is no right, no left and no true opposition party. But there are things on the Democratic platform that should not be toyed with. Gun control is one of them, so when the incumbent Republican Governor Jeb Bush is more pro-gun control than the Democratic candidate, you know something's gone awry.

Neither candidate, though, is particularly fond of passing legislation against guns. Bush is in favor of systematically imprisoning delinquent gun owners, rather than simply keeping guns out of their hands. He flaunts his 10-20-life program as part of what he says has brought Florida's crime rate down to "the lowest level since 1972." 

However, he shouldn't get too happy because the national crime rates have been going down consistently. According to the FBI's uniform crime report, the crime rate has dropped more than 20 percent nationally since 1994.

But gun control is a dead issue in this campaign. There are only two issues that these two bland opponents are really willing to duel over: education (specifically amendment 9) and gay adoption.

Amendment 9 is the tricky one. It would reduce class sizes in K-12 at a cost of $20 billion to $28 billion over the next eight years.  As a college student, I would truly hate to see across the board budget cuts to finance these changes like McBride suggests. 

We've all been through horrible budget cuts recently. Now, there's not even enough money to have our syllabi printed for us. But if we want to be a progressive state known for its aggressive policy on education, smaller class sizes would be ideal. It would be the first amendment of its kind in the nation, and it would force the government to deal with the horrible problem that is school overcrowding. 

McBride believes he can make this work with his 50-cent-per-pack tax on cigarettes. We know that's not going to be possible. The program's cost is much higher than the amount that a cigarette tax would raise.  McBride just has to stand up and say that taxes in general will have to be raised, even if the program does end up costing only the $16 billion he's proposing.  

Bush was the one who cut $1.6 billion dollars in taxes – including tax cuts on investment holdings – during his first two years as governor. Were it not for those tax cuts, the state could have a good $6 billion in the bank to fund Amendment 9.    

It seems the need to cut taxes runs in the family. 

In the last debate, McBride harped on some of Bush's bad decisions as governor. 

One decision, though, that has received very little mention during the race is Governor Bush's decision to end affirmative action in Florida universities. 

Despite whatever Bush may say, enrollment of minorities was dramatically down at the University of Florida last year. Black freshman enrollment dropped 44 percent; Hispanic enrollment dropped 16 percent. Those are hefty numbers that just can't be ignored.

Another of his blunders is his idea of funding schools depending on how well kids perform on the FCAT, an exam designed to test the students' progress and grade level. What are the odds that a school in Liberty City will outperform one in Coral Gables?  What has ended up happening is that poor schools are getting poorer, and the rich ones – well, I guess it's the law of life – are getting richer. 

And because so much emphasis is placed on these statewide exams, the teachers plainly forget to teach anything else.

I have a 12-year-old sister who attends public school. Everyday she comes home with a full load of homework; the problem is she's doing FCAT practices every single day. The teachers encourage the kids to learn the types of problems that will be on the exam, and forget about everything else.

But wait: the school's funding totally hinges their performance on that insignificant test, so they too are being coerced into making the FCAT all that matters.

The gay adoption issue is the only issue McBride seems to have a settled grip on, and I'm glad. What I can't understand though is why Bush is against it. He has admitted that he doesn't oppose gay couples being "guardians," so why not adoptive parents?

Throughout this campaign, however, Bush has showed McBride the advantage political blood can get you: a brother to help you campaign and a hell of a lot better answers to budget questions than "I don't know." 

McBride is just an inexperienced bystander who needs lessons in charm from Bill Clinton. But I'm tired of the Bushes and their elitist nature – whether it be in tax cuts for the rich or disregard for minorities or exams that put disadvantaged people at even more of a disadvantage – and the only thing left to do is hope to find someone who is less evil than they are.  Despite his flaws, it seems McBride might be.

Headline: Lip sync contest ruins Homecoming with debate over winners
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
There were seven seconds in question at the end of the Sigma Phi Epsilon Lip Sync number. And seven days of arguing between three groups of Greeks. 

Last Tuesday, the Student Programming Council sponsored a Lip Sync contest as one of the many Homecoming events. 

Three winners were announced at the end of the contest – Sigma Phi Epsilon and Alpha Xi Delta took first place, Phi Mu and Pi Kappa Alpha took second and Delta Phi Epsilon and Sigma Alpha Mu came in third. 

Apparently dissatisfied with their placement, the second and third place winners appealed the ruling on the basis of time limits. A five-minute limit was set for each performance. 

According to Sigma Phi Epsilon's Lip Sync coordinator, the program ran exactly five minutes, but it took approximately seven additional seconds for the group to exit the stage. 

After seven days of discussion, the result was that all three groups were disqualified and new winners were announced. 

If you ask these groups about the meaning of Homecoming, the answer, according to concerns expressed at a meeting called to resolve the situation, is spirit points. Apparently their main priority is not school spirit, celebrating the inaugural football season or camaraderie but rather a trophy to add to the Greek's collection of awards.

While the contest may have been important to the participants, it is sad that these Greek organizations were incapable of displaying what their names represent: brotherhood. 

They lost focus of the event's main purpose, which is fun. Homecoming week is not about the King and Queen, the floats, the parade or who wins some trophy that the majority of the student body doesn't even know about. 

Homecoming week is about school spirit, teamwork and building relationships with fellow students.  Hopefully in the future this won't be forgotten.

Commentary on Israel not anti-semitic

To the Editor:

With a degree of anguish, I read the letters of Dr. Lazerson and Moshe Nelson in response to the column by Andy Diaz, "Israel claim to land unfounded." While I neither support nor oppose the content of Diaz's article, I commend him for expressing his views in an open forum with dignity and an obvious willingness to bear the burden of criticism that comes with speaking out on sensitive issues. 

Too often, commentators seek to assess the potential of their comments before speaking the truth and thus end up crafting less than a holistic view, often mired in parse.

Nelson's charge that the Diaz article by inference is anti-Semitic is clearly unfounded. Given the Nelson rhetoric, I sense that any observations that Diaz might have made in his article – no matter how reasonable and tempered – would have extracted an "anti-Semitic" description from Nelson. 

I had a somewhat similar encounter recently with a University colleague whom I have long-admired: I questioned the appropriateness of the award of an Honorary Degree to the former president of Israel. The result has been a series of e-mail diatribes – many from people I do not even know and who certainly do not know me – describing me as a colleague of "Islamic suicide bombers," an "anti-Semite," and one who embraces and supports Arafat. 

All of this has made me realize that there is a cadre who perceive any reasonable, balanced commentary that questions the demeanor or motives of Israel within the world community, to be anti-Semitic. Those of a reasonable perspective know that differences of opinion have a much more deeply rooted basis than intolerance of a religious doctrine. 

With regard to Lazerson's comments, he seems to adhere to the theory that "he who was here first" has the right of land and title thereto. In America, we of course realize that all people of all colors, religions, ethnicities and cultures may claim title to land through acquisition. 

But are Americans willing to release their just and legitimate claims to purchased lands, that these lands may be titled to the descendants of Native Americans? What mistrust, anger, acrimony, and outright violence might effuse from such a policy?

Thus, it is not surprising that Palestinians claim lands in Gaza and the Heights, even while more settlements are being constructed by Israelis in these very places.

Speaking out against the policies of Israel in its actions against Palestinians is not anti-Semitic; I recall an article that described how Israeli troops would break the arms of young Palestinian boys caught throwing rocks at tanks and armored personnel carriers during the First Intifada in the '80s. If factual, such behavior bears a striking resemblance to Nazi violence against the residents of the Warsaw Ghetto. Indeed, an interesting parallel.

Diaz's column offers secular argument against Israel

To the Editor:

In the column titled "Israeli claim to land unfounded," Andy Diaz made a completely secular argument as to why the sons and daughters of European immigrants, who happen to profess the religion of Judaism, actually do not have any well founded claim to Israel.  

Though he made a purely secular argument, ironically, he was attacked on a purely Biblical standpoint by a student and a faculty member. 

He was also labeled as being anti-Semitic, and "anti-Biblical" which (the latter) is about the most ridiculous charge that one can be accused of in a secular institution.

What bothers me, however, is that because Diaz decided to make an intelligent analysis of a situation, weigh the facts and make a judgment, which is what any university student should be applauded for, he was instead attacked and accused of being anti-Semitic.

In most universities, we learn to do research, site sources, provide facts, document them and then come to an intellectual conclusion. If a student chooses not to omit facts, overlook evidence, or bend the truth in order to support a certain religious or political agenda then they should be commended and not labeled an anti-Semite.

Professor Lazerson and Moshe Nelson, in their refutation of Diaz's column, chose to site archeological evidence to back their Biblical claims to Israel. Whilst Lazerson was a bit more vague, Nelson stated, "There is archeological evidence that specifically confirms what is written in both testaments of the Bible. 

"There are remnants of both the first and the second holy Jewish Temples, as well as ancient Hebrew and Aramaic writings on walls and ancient structures throughout the country." 

When a person goes beyond Holy Scriptures and attempts to use historical evidence to argue as to why a particular race, religious group and or civilization should maintain exclusive rights to any land, he or she must be prepared to defend the same arguments no matter which land or which race, religion, or civilization may be involved. 

If you research the findings of several prominent historians and archeologists, including Harvard professor and archeologist Dr. Barry Fell or German art historian Alexander Von Wuthenau, you will discover that archeologists have also found ancient Kufic Arabic writing in caves and mountainsides in South West America. 

These writings date back to the ninth century C.E. Over 600 years later, in the diaries of Christopher Colombus, he professed that his impression of the "Caribs" (original inhabitants of the Caribbean) was that they were "Mohammadans" (Muslims). He also wrote that on Oct. 21, 1492, as he was sailing past Gibara on the coast of Cuba, he saw a mosque. Remnants of other mosques have been found in Cuba, Mexico, Texas and Nevada. 

Therefore based on the arguments of Nelson and Lazerson, any Muslim nation should be able to take this collection of archeological evidence, which backs up the Quranic declaration that "Allah is the creator of all the heavens and the earth," (all land belongs to Allah) and be justified in an invasion followed by a colonization of America. 

If Lazerson or Moshe are not prepared to back up this argument as well, then I suggest that instead of accusing Diaz of being a weak journalist, an irresponsible student, or an anti-Semite, that they accuse him of the only thing that you can accuse him of: that he chooses not to submit to your Biblical arguments.

Headline: Editor's quarter-life crisis hinges on absence of novelty in life
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
When I was 11, I moved to a new house. It was nicer than the modest Westchester home I grew up in: larger, with a pool and a tiki hut, in a more affluent neighborhood. I remember that house then had a magical kind of air. 

It was exciting to find myself in a new environment, learning all those hideouts and strange places unique to every house. The neighbors all seemed quite happy to have us, and were very outgoing.

That was that grace period where everything is still awash in that golden haze of novelty.

It's been 10 years since I moved there, and there isn't much of that magic left. The neighbors take your presence for granted and a casual head-nod is about as much acknowledgement as you can expect while taking out your garbage in the morning. I haven't used the pool in months, all the citrus trees were removed during the citrus chancre scare, the palm trees became diseased and died, and the tiki hut lost its exotic thatched roof during Hurricane Irene, and was replaced by a more conventional shingled roof. Sometimes I get up in the morning and hope to open my eyes and find myself in another room, another house, another place.

Essentially, that's how I feel about my college experience. I came to FIU from Southwest High, a school reputed for it's questionable aesthetics. FIU's clean halls, Mediterranean-style architecture, and hip landscaping lent the campus a kind of gated-community beauty that impressed me. 

Classes were comparatively brief, and it was a pleasant surprise to find that teachers at this level had no interest in babying their students.

And there were so many classes, precisely titled and promising all kinds of knowledge.

There were strange places and loose-knit societies about the blue tables and other hangouts like Gracie's that were still fresh, and everything about this place had the kind of mystical air of opportunity that any new environment brings.

It's been four years since that day I walked through the Graham Center for the first time, and in that time I've dabbled in those communities and met some people I'll soon forget, others I won't and some I wish I could. I've taken my fair share of classes (admittedly, not as many as I should; I'm on the five-year plan) and found them to be uneven. Some were interesting, but most fell flat. 

There was a time when I didn't regret being here. I actually enjoyed it. But something's changed. Lately, when I walk around campus, there aren't many familiar faces. Most of my friends have either graduated or moved on in their lives, and the younger crowd that stepped in their place doesn't suit me anymore.  And all the places are too familiar, old hats with too many memories. 

School itself is an old hat, and there comes a time when you're sick of learning, and you want to start doing. I've felt for sometime that I don't have much to learn from class that's worth learning. There isn't much about writing that any teacher can teach me that I couldn't learn writing what you're reading.

Call it a quarter-life crisis, but that sense of opportunity, that sense of unexplored territory is gone.

So when a friend, noting my apathy towards attending class, asked me what I was doing at FIU, I didn't have an immediate answer to give her.

I reflected on the past four years, and finally, I answered: "I've never really cared for school." But what I meant to say, and what I might have said if the question hadn't caught me by surprise, is that somewhere along the line, all the magic went out of it. When I park in the Gold Garage these days, I find myself wishing I was in another place.

Headline: Gil leads Men's soccer to win over USF, 3-2
Author: Daisy Fernández
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team has not fallen yet. On Sunday afternoon at University Park, the Golden Panthers sent the Bulls of USF home with a 3-2 win in overtime. The team has boosted its record to 8-4-1.

The Bulls played an impressive game in both halvestaking the lead in the 25th minute. Their most promising freshman, Hunter West (who has made 11 goals this year), scored on an assist by midfielder/forward Gabriel Salgado. Salgado pulled a cross to the front of the goal, where West kicked the ball to the back of the net. 

"We weren't focusing in the first half. We came out flat and they took advantage," said sophomore Oscar Gil.

The success of the Bulls continued into the second half, as Gabriel Salgado made a goal of his own off a pass by West at the 50:33 mark.
"We gave 100 percent. The heat fatigued both teams, but we kept playing, " Gil said.

Many loud and stirred FIU fans were delighted at the 66th minute when the game began to turn around. Bulls' midfielder Brandon Streicher was red carded for a foul, and the team was forced to play with only 10 players. 

Meanwhile, the Golden Panthers kept working together and their efforts drove senior defender Juan Rivera to score unassisted with a line drive.

"Going into the second, we had to forget the defensive mistakes in the first half and keep going. We hung in there and didn't give up," Rivera said.

At the 82nd minute, midfielder Billy Boswell scored on a throw-in by Oscar Gil.  His goal tied the score and pushed the teams into overtime.  
Excitement filled the soccer stadium when Oscar Gil took the game-wining shot with the clock rading 95:14. From the left corner of the box, he shot the ball over the head of USF's keeper Perkins, and won the match for the Golden Panthers.

Florida International outshot USF 26 to 15. Roy Rosenberg managed eight saves against USF, while Troy Perkins made 13. 

With this game, USF weakens to 9-5-0.

"I'm really excited. It was a big win for us. Two big conference games are coming up, and we needed this win to take us to the playoffs," Rivera said. 

"I think that if we stay focused, we can win the rest of the games. We'll see how it goes," Gil stated. 

The team next faces Adelphi on Friday at University Park.

Headline: Critical mistakes key homecoming loss for FIU
Author: Dan Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With FIU leading visiting Gardner-Webb in their first ever homecoming game, a blown coverage on a third-and- thirteen enabled Bulldogs running back George Pressley, who rushed for 104 yards on 11 carries, to score what would prove to be the difference maker in Gardner-Webb's 17-14 victory. 

On the ensuing possession, FIU put together a sustained drive that lasted almost seven minutes and covered 76 yards, putting the Golden Panthers on the one-yard line. The stage was set for Jerrid Lundstedt. The junior from Homestead replaced starter Rashod Smith, who was took himself out of the game after severe cramping. On third-and-goal from the GWU one, Lundstedt tried bouncing out to his left after being met by a Gardner-Webb linebacker that plugged the hole he was supposed to run through. Lundstedt was stripped of the football by Jason Threat and it would eventually be recovered by Jim Maxwell for Gardner-Webb. "Our running back tries to make chicken salad out of you know what," Strock said. "We played hard to the wire, but if you make mistakes you're not going to win."

"We had an 18 play drive, a 14 play drive and we got no points. Obviously, we're not good enough to put people away yet."

Squandered opportunities became a recurring theme for the Golden Panthers as they would be put in position to win the game with a little under two minutes to play when safety Nick Turnbull closed in on a pass thrown by Jeremy Martin on third-and-eleven and deflected the ball away from a Bulldog receiver, giving the offense one last chance with two timeouts left. A 41-yard punt by Graha Whitlock to the FIU 31 yard line would be fumbled by Lagrant Perry and recovered by Chris Foster. That would be FIU's last opportunity to piece together a comeback in front of 6,733 spectators on Saturday.

With 1:26 left in the game, Gardner-Webb proceeded to run just three more plays before time would expire and FIU's record dropped to 3-5. 
Foster rushed for 86 yards on 17 attempts for the visiting Bulldogs. He found the end zone from three yards out with 5:41 to go in the game's opening quarter.  

Following an Ira Turner pass deflection on third down, the Golden Panthers would get on the scoreboard on their ensuing drive after a fake punt went for naught when Cory McKinney deflected the pass thrown by Bulldog punter Graha Whitlock. 

Smith rushed for 87 yards on 24 carries and capped off a 6 play, 69 yard drive with a 26-yard run-knotting the score at seven.

On Adam Moss' ensuing kickoff, T.J. Singletary jarred the ball loose at the Gardner-Webb 17 where it would be recovered by a group of swarming FIU special teamers. The Golden Panther offense made quick work of the situation, scoring on the third play following the turnover on a 16-yard pass from Jamie Burke to Julius Eppinger, giving FIU a 14-7.

"I thought we had grabbed the momentum," Turner said. "I thought we were going to take that and win the game."

Bulldog kicker Andrew Harmon easily nailed a 46-yarder into a stiff wind to bring the Bulldogs closer at 14-10 prior to the intermission. The field goal ended a 10-play 52-yard drive for Gardner-Webb.That's the way things would stay until the fourth quarter in which a veteran Gardner-Webb team would get the best of a young FIU squad. "Obviously this was a game we should have won," Strock said. "We made some plays, but then we didn't make some."

FIU next faces Jacksonville on Thursday night on Sunshine Network.

Headline: Peruvian president power-plays paternity
Author: Angela Castillo /. Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo finally acknowledged his daughter Zarai two weeks ago, after 14 years of denying that he is her father. Zaria's mother Lucrecia Orozco has been staging protests against the government since her daughter's birth.  Now it seems that the telenovela of Toledo's illegitimate daughter has finally come to something of a "happily ever after." But did we Peruvians believe the final scene in which Alejandro Toledo hugged his daughter Zarai? Did we believe him when he said "I have won a smart and beautiful daughter"? No, of course not. 

It's bull and he's a hypocrite! We all know he refused to acknowledge her so many times in the past, on and off camera. The only thing the president has won is a bad reputation; Peru has won a bad reputation. 

Toledo could not have been so blind as not to see that Zarai and he not only resemble each other physically, but that she had also inherited his way of speaking. One main difference however is that honesty, justice and responsibility are words that are not in Toledo's vocabulary, and if they are, he has forgotten the meaning.  

His many personal mistakes have contributed to the false stereotypes foreigners have about Peru and its public figures. One of these famous people is Laura Bozzo. Her talk show, (the Hispanic version of Jerry Springer, but worse) was where Zarai's case was discussed for the first time seven years ago. It is shameful for the president of a country to have the case of his illegitimate daughter discussed on a trashy talk show.  

And while Zarai has won respect, admiration, popularity, financial support and justice, she hasn't gotten the one thing she was probably wishing for this coming Christmas: affection. Peruvians may think that she is indifferent to that because she has always been surrounded by the love of her mother and her uncle, whom she calls "Daddy Lucho," but I do not think that a parent can be replaced. 

I can't imagine how painful it was for Zarai to see her father on television harshly denying her so many times.  I can't imagine Toledo turning around and covering his face with a book when his young daughter looked him in the eyes. And I wonder, what is the purpose of him acknowledging her, if he  doesn't really care?  What is he going to give, if not affection: a last name? Money? A lesson to the bunch of "Toledos" who don't want to take care of their children? 

I do not want answers to the first three questions because I would have to admit that we Peruvians are somewhat responsible for the hatred and rancor Zarai has cultivated in her heart because of all the years we asked her to fight for her rights and the rights of many other unwanted and unacknowledged children, instead of asking about her feelings first. 

I'm afraid hatred was Zarai's motivation to become such a young and brave activist leader. I'm more afraid to think that it was hatred that made her strong enough to bring down what is left of the president's image. I really need to believe that Toledo's motivation behind acknowledging his daughter has to do with justice and responsibility. We cannot  criticize people if we don't  start by judging the individuals who are supposed to be our role models. 

I can't believe how Toledo still pretends to be a president that will look after the children's future when he does not care about his own daughter. No one knows what Zarai's future will be with all the negative feelings she possesses and the suffering that has wounded her for the rest of her life. 

So, let's just stop believing in the "happily ever after" ending of this telenovela, because it is just a façade.  Let's erase from our minds the idea that Zarai is the Peruvian Cinderella who will have the opportunity to live in a beautiful palace from now on because we know it won't be that way. 

The president has no obligation to get close to her, but if someday he decides to, I hope it is not only to pretend that they have a good relationship. 

I'm sure Zarai's experience has been painful, but it was necessary to realize that justice is possible here on Earth.

Headline: Hughley entertains at Panther Prowl
Author: Angela Castillo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Homecoming's Panther Prowl rally welcomed comedians Malik Sanon and D.L. Hughley last Thursday evening after a series of opening acts including FIU's Golden Idol and Greek sororities Alpha Kappa Alpha, Betta Kappa Gama, and Sigma Gamma Ro. 

 "The Original Kings of Comedy"'s D.L. Hughley had the crowd in stitches. He made jokes about Miami's ethnic population and college students in general. 

"What's your major, sweetheart?" he asked to a student in the audience. "Communications," she answered. "Communications? Ha ha, are you serious? So you are like, hi? Hello? I wanna eat now! What...are you gonna communicate? It's BS," he said. 

"Anyone here studying Philosophy?" D.L. Hughley asked. No one in the audience answered. "I think...I think...I need a job, godddam it," he yelled again.

Before leaving, D.L. Hughley wished good luck to the football team and a limousine outside the gym was waiting to take him home.

The Greeks performed a step-dance show as the first opening act of the night. 

The time for the Golden Idol final competition came and the four finalists were announced.  

The lights dimmed and Chrissie Fit, the winner, started singing "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston. 

The audience did not wait for Chrissie to finish for the standing ovation. They were all excited chanting her name. 

"It is the first time I have performed in front of so many people, and I think I gave it all I have. For me, it's more than an honor and an accomplishment to be the Golden Idol," she said.

Following this, Alicia Almainsa and Carlos Porras, hosts of the event, introduced the homecoming court candidates once again and announced the talent show winners, Bill Wilson and Alissa Stone.

"I sang a song from my favorite movie 'The Color Purple''s 'Miss Celie's Blues.' I usually sing in the shower or for my roommates, but I definitely did my best singing a capella at the talent show. It was a good experience. I enjoyed it," English major Alissa Stone said.

"I wanted to make an impact in how students reacted, so I danced salsa, reggae, hip hop, free-style, trance, and a little bit of gooey. It was a lot of fun and it's probably one of the greatest performances I've ever put on and the greatest reactions I've ever got," finance major Bill Wilson said.

The crowd was so anxious to see the comedians' performance that they ended up booing and stamping their feet, hampering the mention of the event's sponsors that included the FIU Bookstore and food services, as well as the Miami New Times and T.G.I Fridays. 

"Koolaid" Malik Sanon was  the opening act for D.L Hughley. Some of his jokes relied on the Hispanic community, "Hispanic people, they are all Sanchez, Gonzalez...I love Hispanic people, they are smooth," he yelled.  

"I think the comedy show was great.  Both comedians were very funny, I was laughing a whole lot. The only thing is that I was expecting to see the cheerleading and the dazzlers, but they never showed up," broadcast journalism major Giannina Vasquez said.

&nbsp;
Biscayne Bay students celebrated Homecoming with a variety of events last week. 

"I have enjoyed this Homecoming week because everyday a different activity was planned, and events like the auction really got the crowd going. This was definitely an exciting week," Yane Marquez, freshman, nursing said.

On Monday afternoon students showed up to "freestyle" to the beats from a DJ at an open mic session. 

Later that night a fashion show was the entertainment. The Student Programming Council and Panther Power member Renee John-Williams said the turnout was awesome for a Monday night. At the Fashion Show, the crowd's excitement was built up with a performance of the Golden Stars Dance Team.

Tuesday morning students were auctioned for Friday's Homecoming dance.  Students up for auction paraded across the catwalk-like stage. The offers for the dateless students didn't climb higher than single-digit dollar amounts.

Throughout Thursday, Panther Power worked on school spirit at Panther Square, handing out "Paw Power" cardboard fans, and hosting a pep rally including the featured a performance by The Golden Stars. Approximately 100 students  attended. 

"The turnout for all the events has been great. The Golden Stars performance on Monday night was incredible and everything has turned out to be great and organized very well," said Renee John-Williams, freshman, member of SPC and Panther Power. 

In front of The Oasis in Academic One, a voting booth was set up for the Homecoming elections. Across from the voting booth, senior Masifa Meme campaigned with refreshments, doughnuts, and candy for those who walked by on their way to class. "Amazingly enough, a lot of students have come out to vote for this years for Homecoming court. You get a frisbee and pins when you vote," John-Williams said.

"My first years at FIU, I was very academically oriented and didn't participate in the campus events, but I've always wanted to run for Queen. Now that I had the opportunity, I did it, and that's where I am now," Meme said.

The crowning took place on Friday, at the Homecoming Dance and Concert, held in the Kovens Conference Center. 

The concert featured R&B locals Floetry, Reggae hits Tanto Metro and Devonte, hip hop artist Pitbull, as well as DJ Aspekt and DJ Epps. "Since it is the first Homecoming Football Game, what we tried to do this  year was add a concert to the Homecoming Dance with different flavors of music," Brochner Louidor, sophomore and vice president of SPC said.

Headline: Tower students win lip sync contest
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Campus Life's Homecoming Committee staged its annual Lip Sync Contest to an audience of 800 students last Wednesday night.

This year's competition was themed "Live in Egypt." Ten different songs were performed. 

Groups included clubs and organizations such as Panther Rage, the Student Programming Council, and residence hall associations from  University Park Towers and Everglades Hall.

 A number of fraternities and sororities including Alpha Xi Delta, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Pi Kappa Phi, Phi Sigma Sigma, Lamda Theta Phi, Phi Mu, Pike, Delta Phi Epsilon and Phi Gamma Delta also participated. 

The students representing the residential towers won first place. SPC and Panther Rage won second and third places respectively.  

Justin Low, last year's homecoming king, and Cedric McMinn hosted the event which lasted from 8 p.m. until about 10:30 p.m.  

"This year's performance adhered to the rules more than in previous years," said Brian Swensen, a member of the Homecoming committee. "We were stricter about following the rules."

Safety was primarily on the committee's mind that night.

"We only allowed the maximum capacity allowed for chairs to come in, thus allowing for a safer event," Swensen said.  

Once the Graham Center ballrooms were filled to capacity, roughly 200 students who wanted to watch were redirected to GC 140 where they could watch all of the festivities via satellite television. 

 "The GC 140 idea was a good idea because it allowed those who could not get into the event to watch," Swenson said. 

"I think it filled up so quickly because of all the different acts that were scheduled to perform," McMinn said.

This was the first year that junior Ryan Roth, vice president of public relations for Alpha Kappa Psi organized the event.  

The entire homecoming committee helped plan Wednesday night's capacity-crowd event. In addition, so did the FIU bookstore, Miami New Times and Panther Rage. This year the Honors College assisted the Homecoming effort in general.

Overall, organizers and participants were pleased with the outcome of the event. 

"The event was awesome and it truly showed spirit for the first football season," said Roth.

Headline: Talent show kicks off week
Author: Christina Kent / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The spirit of homecoming week was in full swing by Tuesday's Homecoming Court Talent Show as vote-hungry candidates for King and Queen, Prince and Princess strutted onto the stage to dance, sing, and talk about their hobbies and interests. 

"The talent show is intended to be an exhibition of the skills that each of the candidates have," Angelica Fernandez, assistant director for administration and personnel of Homecoming Parliament. "It's an opportunity for them to shine in the spotlight," she said.

Contestants were asked by hosts Justin Low and Lisa Mallard to talk about their majors, community service projects, and future career goals. "What is the one thing you would change on campus if you could?" and "What advice would you give to incoming FIU students?" were common questions. 

Most candidates stressed campus and community involvement and their mission to promote school pride to help make FIU more like a "traditional university".

Queen candidate Diana Bartomeu told the audience that if she won, she would use the opportunity to better FIU. 

"I don't want Homecoming to seem like a popularity contest. If I get elected, I want to be more like a representative of spirit at FIU," she said.

"This show is a new tradition we're trying to start at FIU," Manuel Rosa, coordinator of the event, said. "It began this summer when the students of Homecoming Parliament – 25 students from over 12 different organizations – brainstormed how to make the pageant representative of school spirit...and that's how the talent show came about."

All contestants did a synchronized dance on stage at the start of the show. 

"At first I was skeptical about performing [in the dance segment], but it was a good opportunity to meet other candidates and really feel like we're all in this together," said Jessica Franchi-Alfaro, candidate for Homecoming Princess.

Later King and Queen contestants got down and dirty with their own mini-performances.

King candidate Marc Silver's comedic act as a dummy on a  ventriloquist's knee was one of the most unique talents and the only to try to encourage laughter from the audience.

Bill Wilson, another King candidate, did an impressive dance routine which combined ballroom dancing, break dancing, raving, and some serious booty shaking.Every candidate had their own screaming fan club in the crowd of over 300, composed of their Greek buddies or supporters from their respective organizations.

Alan Dritenbas, sophomore, mechanical engineering, and Ray Perez, junior, advertising, went to cheer for fellow Sigma Phi Epsilon brother and candidate for king Lorenzo Arca – who was not able to appear in the show.

"I think it's really awesome that people are getting involved through Homecoming events," said Dritenbas.

"It's uniting the school, 'unleashing the panther within,'" added Perez.

"This is a fun event, and I look forward to going to the Homecoming football game later this week," said Jeannette Delconte, who went to root for her Residence Advisor, prospective Queen Luchi Procaccio.

Candidate for King David Mesas summed up the Homecoming sentiment. "Until I die, I'm always going to be blue and gold."

&nbsp;
FIU Alumni and faculty were honored at the second Torch Awards  on Oct. 25 at the Wyndham Miami Airport Hotel.  Fifteen awards were given to alumni and FIU faculty, honoring vision, achievement, community service, leadership, and service at FIU, Faculty were eligible for outstanding achievement awards. 

The event is held in honor of those who have had a positive impact on their profession, the community and the University. "We host this event to recognize our own alumni for certain achievements that they've achieved throughout their lives, whether it be in their own profession, their life, and so forth," Ralph Espinosa, president of the Alumni Association said.

"In order to select the honorees, we enlist a committee of students, faculty, alumni, and community leaders that make nominations either through the FIU website or by faxing in nominations," Espinosa said.

After the initial selection of awardees is made, "a group of three people are selected to receive the individual awards, in the individual categories," Espinosa said. 

Steve Tello , 1979 graduate of the school of journalism and mass communications and current senior vice president of Fox Sports News in Los Angeles, received the Outstanding Achievement Award. 

"It's a great privilege to win this award and to be in the first group inducted in this kind of award. It's an amazing thing for me," Tello said.  

Tello is one of many who feels priveleged.  The odds of winning an award are very low;  over 100,000 students have graduated in FIU's 30 year history. 

Artist and 1996 graduate Victoria Gitman winner of the Charles E. Perry Visionary Award, shared Tello's sentiment. "I am very proud to receive this award," she said. "Although it's so early in my career [and] I still have a long way to go," Gitman said. 

The event also featured honors for its current faculty. 

"I think one of the nicest honors you can get is from your former students," Outstanding Faculty Award winner Jack Parker said, "It's unbelievably exciting for me, it's what I've worked for, for 30 years at FIU."  

The first awards ceremony, held in 1998, began a tradition of celebrating FIU graduate's individual achievements and instilling a foundation for future honorees.  

"This is something that I think we are going to continue for many years to come. It was a tradition started many years ago as a breakfast and has become a dinner over the last couple years," Espinosa said.  

The event featured keynote speaker Barry E. Johnson, vice president of corporate affairs for AT&T.  His speech focused on attitudes of successful leaders.  

"Always remember life is a series of choices--you have the freedom to make a choice--  choices between love and hate, between gratification and long term goals, and governing. It all is your attitude."

Johnson received a standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech, which reiterated the importance of "giving back to the community with your time and your treasure."

Headline: New system integrates campus voting
Author: Alejandra Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A new web-based voting system will allow students to vote for any Student Governtment Council candidate regardless of the voter's resident campus. This means students at Biscayne Bay campus can vote for candidate for University Park and vice versa. 

"Before this new system, if students wanted to vote for a candidate that represented University Park, they had to go and vote there but now we have tailored the system so that voting can take place from both campuses, " Campus Life and Orientation Associate Director David Cole said.  

Five computers will be set up at the Enrollment Center at BBC.  At UP, students will be able to vote in the Graham Center computer labs on the fourth floor and in the Green Library.

Colestes convenience and safety as two major advantages to this system. 

"Because the voting will take place at the Enrollment Center, any problems students have with the voting process can be conveniently solved right there," Cole said.  "This convenience could prove to make for a better turn out of students, making this election particularly exciting," he said. 

"Security has always been a big issue for us and the ease that comes with the new system will make the voting process much easier to protect," Cole explained. 

The web-based voting system integrates a security system that has proven to be effective at other college campuses in the state.  

"Students have to swipe an ID and log on with their PIN," Ana Manrara, SGC clerk, said.  "Once a person is finished voting, an administrator has to go in and prompt the screen for the next person to vote," she said. "SGA advisors and Campus Life administrators will be monitoring the voting," she said.   

"This type of security is great because it protects the students and ensures that the system is protected as well," Cole said.

Controlled voting sites is also a safety measure at BBC. "Students are only given access to the system from the five websites that will be available to them at the computers that will be set up in the Enrollment Center," Cole said.  "Because we want to make sure that no one is allowed to vote for someone else, only certain sites will be active. We are trying to do the most we can to protect the voting process," he said.

Students like the new system.  "Sounds good to me," Roxanne Slinger, sophomore, psychologty said.  "I think its a great idea."

Kira Knight, freshman, pre-med, agreed. "Better security, then why not?" she said. 

Voting is scheduled for Wednesday, October 31, from 9. to 6 p.m. at both campuses.

There are no students running for the five positions at BBC, including reps from business administration , Broward, graduate school, and nursing school. At University Park, there is one open position with no candidate at the school of architecture.

Many students said they will be voting. "I am looking forward to voting because hopefully many much needed changes will take place particularly on this campus (BBC)," Jorge Castillo, senior, television production, said.  "I have closely followed this election because I base my vote on how [candidates] plan to help the students, and what they stand for is important to me," he said.

Even though many students are ready to vote, some seem concerned with the whole election process. 

Jennifer Otero, junior, advertising, said that she didn't know much about the elections or the candidates because it wasn't advertised as much as she would have thought.  

"I barely knew that elections were taking place because the candidates have campaigned very little, but I guess that happens when you run unopposed."

1-Harry Potter- J.K. Rowling's beloved wizard makes for a ghoulishly fun costume! Rounded glasses and disheveled hair go halfway to creating the impression. For an authentic scar, use a carving knife or, if that fails, a sharp screwdriver should do the job.

2-Lord of the Rings- Fans of J. R. R. Tolkien know that the classic trilogy is a treasure chest of costume ideas. Among the most popular are smelly, hairy, dateless Hobbit; smelly, fat, dateless Dwarf; and smelly, gangly, dateless Elf.

3-Osama Bin Laden- This is one of the more popular costumes of the year. Imagine the thrill of having the George W. Bush costumes appear to chase you, only to end up going for the guy in the Saddam Hussein costume instead.

4-Adam Sandler-  All you need to do is be your usual goofy self, but walk around with a critically acclaimed director and watch people treat you like you've suddenly overcome all your mental deficiencies.

5-Christina Aguilera- The Christina Aguilera costume is one of the scariest costumes on this year's line-up. It consists of no clothes whatsoever, but comes with the venereal disease of your choice.

Headline: Demme can't handle "Truth"
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
"The Truth About Charlie" not only has the gall to think it can excuse its lack of coherent story with "style over substance," it's actually pulling the wool over many top critics eyes by using buzz words of sickening movie pomposity. A grand "homage" to "French New Wave" and "Francois Truffaut," "Charlie" is nothing more than a blithering remake, Hollywood's latest prop out of the bastardization machinery.

Which is a tragedy because "Charlie" is based on one of the great "dapper" mystery flicks of its time, "Charade," starring a glowing Audrey Hepburn and the suave Cary Grant. For everything that "Charade" did right, "Charlie" seems to do wrong. In fact, the only half-right thing "Charlie" does is realize it can never be "Charade."

The plot, or what's discernible from it, involves Regina Lambert (Thandie Newton), a recently married woman whom discovers that her husband, the titular Charlie, has been murdered. He also was some kind of con-artist with many different personas and $6 million in stolen money that many bad people want. Among these bad people may/may not be Joshua Peters (Mark Wahlberg), an American tourist than seems to follow Regina around like a cross between a lost puppy, an in-love schoolboy and a menacing former rapper/underwear model turned actor. No, seriously. If you had Marky Mark (or any member of the Funky Bunch) following you around the streets of Paris, wouldn't you be terrified?

Part of the problem with "Charlie" is that often follows the story of "Charade" only for the sake of needing a story to attach to the pretty sequences. Director Johnathan Demme spends most his time figuring out how he can rotate the camera to produce a cool shot and forgets what's going on in the background. Meanwhile, the actors attempt to be cute by either quickly talking and cutting each other off or by long penetrating stares. The chemistry between Newton and Wahlberg is like oil and water. These two "lovebirds" looks like they'd have a hard time screwing at gunpoint. The result is slightly charming direction with canned dialogue from clichéd acting of boring characters for unknown plot point reasons. 

Did I mention the plot goes nowhere past the premise, yet? Off the top of my head, I count 10 characters whom apparently play a significant role in the movie. Of those 10, I can give you the motivations or the importance of zero. Even Regina gets into the game of "who's good, who's bad" and "what little plot is she up to." By the time you get to the end, you accept the ending only because it tries so hard to make sense, you pretend to get it in case people around you actually did and you don't want to make a fool of yourself.

Then again, let's not be fooled. The filmmakers don't really care if you get the ending or not. Again, plot did not seem to be important to the making of "Charlie." Thus, the movie's posters give away the crucial secret of where the money is hidden. Or the fact that a casual glance at the cast leaves you two choices for whom the real baddy is (and it's probably not the romantic interest).

"Charlie" is also the first films to ever irritate me with its usage of music. There must've been 60 songs throughout the movie, because every time a character enters a room, exits a room, says something interesting, casts a suspicious glance, scratches his or her nose, etc, a new song is played. At one point, there is so much going on musically, it just becomes grating background noise. And it just so happens that at this exact same moment, Joshua decides to play a CD. The moment he hits the button to open the player, the music stops just long enough for him to pop in a completely new song. Whomever edited the music for "Charlie" cuts faster between tracks than MTV music videos cut on images.

It's not that "Charlie" is muddled. It's that "Charlie" is a complete catastrophe. Rather than watch this dreck, you really should try to catch "Charade" on cable or on video. Even if you don't prefer Hepburn to Newton like I do, at the very least, you'll guarantee yourself a movie that makes sense. And isn't telling stories the whole point of storytelling?

Author: Adriana Pereira
&nbsp;
Starting Nov. 1, the School of Music will break down the barriers of music and sound as it hosts its 7th Annual FIU Music Festival.  The event will run through Nov. 16 and will feature the musical talents of Jazz sax man David Sanborn, trumpet icon Arturo Sandoval and Notre Dame's world-renowned organ player Olivier Latry, as well as other artists from France, Belgium, Denmark and Japan.

The festival's presence is strongly felt not only on campus but also throughout South Florida. The nightly events will be taking place at locations such as FIU's Wertheim Performing Arts Center in University Park, the FIU Wolfsonian Museum on Miami Beach, the Gusman Center, the Lincoln Theatre and the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, among others.  

Street banners are being put up on the roads of Miami in hopes of attracting a large and diverse crowd. "We're bringing awareness to the community of what we're doing," said Karen Fuller, producer of the festival. "It is one of the major cultural events of FIU."

Fuller, who is a full-time faculty member of the School of Music and also runs a graduate program on producing musical concerts and events, has worked professionally in Broadway, and is not only producing the festival, but performing a dance piece as well.

Assisting her in her duties is the Director of the School of Music and Artistic Director of the festival, Fredrick Kaufman. "We work hand in hand," said Kaufman, who alongside Fuller has been preparing the festival and in doing so has even visited Japan, among other places, in search of artists who will share their talents at the festival. "I think each one of the festivals has its own personality but this year's will be eclectic and the international scope will definitely be felt," he said.

On opening night jazz, R&B and pop saxophonist David Sanborn will team up with the FIU Jazz band and the FIU Faculty Jazz Quartet and Gary Campbell for an entertaining night of Jazz at the Gusman Theatre. David Sanborn has a nationally syndicated radio show and appears often on the David Letterman show.

South Florida will get a feel of the Notre Dame's Cathedral in Paris, France when Olivier Latry, organist from the Cathedral, visits the Wertheim Performing Arts Center and delivers "Mostly Messiaen," an organ music piece. Toots Thielemans, the man responsible for the Sesame Street soundtrack, will also team up with several other musicians in brining a night of blues, jazz and contemporary sounds to the Coral Gables Congregational Church.  

After two years of planning and a 10-day trip to five of Japan's cities by Fuller and Kaufman, one of the most anticipated events is sure to be Japan Night. Each year the festival represents a different country that is significant to the world of music. In previous years countries such as Brazil and Poland have been showcased. This year, with the help of the FIU Institute for Asian Studies and the Japanese Consulate, the School of Music will bring the spirit of Japan to life as they offer students as well as the community a taste of Japanese life. 

Perhaps the most significant figure of this evening will be Masaru Kawasaki, a Japanese composer and conductor as well as a Hiroshima survivor. Kawasaki, whose wife is also a survivor and will accompany him to South Florida, is the man responsible for composing the piece that is played yearly at the Hiroshima Peace Ceremony.   

Taking place at the Performing Arts Center in University Park, the event will consist of three parts.  The first will include a performance of the Koto, a traditional Japanese instrument, by Brian Yamakoshi. The FIU symphony will then team up with Kawasaki to deliver his piece honoring Hiroshima. The third concert will consist of a multicultural contemporary piece including Japanese Taiko Drums and a Flamenco dance performance by Fuller herself.  

This three-series concert will take place in an environment set up to resemble Japan, complete with a stone garden, lanterns, art and a variety of Japanese food. During intermissions, the audience is sure to enjoy typical Japanese traditions such as a tea ceremony, a Kimono fashion show and a martial arts demonstration. 

"We're basically trying to represent Japan as much as we can," said Fuller. 

  Also in the lineup for these 16 days of music, talent and culture is a trombone sound and light show by soloist Mark Hetzler who will combine theatrical productions with musical compositions to depict a Broadway-like evening.  In a night dedicated to female composers and their music, watch the viewing of "Forbidden Planet," the first film to use an electronic score, composed, of course, by a woman. Listen in as Maestro Stewart Robertson, music director of the Florida Grand Opera and newest artist-in-residence of the FIU Symphony Orchestra teams up with other musical talents to deliver a breathtaking concert at the Lincoln Theatre.

Bringing a close to this year's festival is FIU's very own Arturo Sandoval, who is an Artist-in-Residence and full time faculty member at the School of Music.  Dance the night away as the FIU Jazz Band joins Sandoval and the Latin Connection in an energetic and full of life grand finale.

"I think it's a good way for people to experience different types of music," says freshmen Federico Magnorsky, a band member. He goes on to say, "People will be able to hear music live as opposed to the everyday radio edit."    

The festival is meant not only to provide the FIU community and South Florida with entertainment,  but also to allow the students of the School of Music to demonstrate their talents and expand their musical experiences. 

"It is imperative for students to rub shoulders with professionals," says Kaufman.

  These artists not only offer their talents but also their support in music education and aid the students by giving seminars and lectures on how to better their performances.          

Ticket prices for students range from $5 to $15 and are available at the FIU Music Festival Box Office at (305) 348-1998. The official website can be found at www.fiumusicfestival.org.  

"The festival is put here for the students.  We would like to see them, we welcome them and we hope they will come," says Kaufman.

Headline: Spanish rock legends send hopeful message
Author: Angela Castillo
&nbsp;
Spanish rock legends Maná have released their seventh studio album, Revolucion de Amor, Love Revolution, and it is, in one word, astonishing, an epic about the search for love and the pros and cons of finding it. 

Revolución de Amor has the magic to act as pain relief for anyone who identifies with the chaotic world we live in nowadays. With this album, Maná proves that rock and pop can be musically surrounded by power ballads, bolero, salsa and the influences of Hindu and Afro-Cuban rhythms at the same time.

 The lyrics of the songs are still gummy and repetitive (an unfortunate Maná trademark), but they are more mature and powerful since it's not all about "Boy meets girl, boy loses girl" anymore. Instead, they deal with political and social matters. The lyrics are also very optimistic. The band urges people to open their mouth, speak for their rights, walk away from their taboos and live their lives the way they want to. 

Of course, love isn't entirely absent from the album. The lyrics include quotes about love from such notable people as Sub-Comandante Marcos – a Mexican activist leader – Jesus Christ, John Lennon, Beethoven and Gandhi, among others. These quotes have the intention to make people think about revolution not as a synonym of anarchy, but rather as an evolution leading to unity. 

"Angel de amor," "Angel of love," is the first single from the album and it is already a top track in Spanish radio; it is a song that encourages you to not give up, even if you have already been wounded. There is always a way out, an escape that may take long to find, but sooner or later will come. 

"Ay Doctor" and "Fe," "Faith," evoke images of people depending on drugs to get rid of nostalgia and solitude since the lyrics mention the use of anti-depressives such as Prozac. 

"Fe," which was written before the events of Sept. 11, gives an idea of the poor human connections we've made by thinking of war and revenge as the best solution to terrorism. 

"Pobre Juan," "Poor John," is probably Maná's most innovative song, incorporating reggae, pop- rock and even punk. The lyrics portray Juan's odyssey to America: his painful departure from the love of his life, who is pregnant and the racism he faces while working in this country as a waiter.

"Mariposa Traicionera," "Treacherous Butterfly," is a chauvinist bolero that points out the beauty and malice of the "easy" woman that may hook up with you and others at the same time. "Porqué Te Vas?" "Why are you Leaving?" is just a conventional break-up song. There's sadness and melancholy for the loss of a loved one. The song tells the story of an old lady who literally dies of love after losing her husband in an accident. 

The most important song of the album is "Justicia, Tierra y Libertad," "Justice, Land and Freedom," which includes a duet between guest musicians Carlos Santana and Panamanian salsa singer Ruben Blades. "When will we have democracy? When will we knock bureaucracy down?" evokes an international outcry that defends the rights of the indigenous people of Latin America.

"Sábanas Frias," "Cold Sheets," combines salsa and cumbia with a lively chorus interpreted by Ruben Blades. The lyrics have created controversy among the close-minded people who still believe that it is taboo for unmarried couples to live together. 

Revolución de Amor is a very special album, not only because it answers certain elemental needs, and denounces the political repression found in most Latin American countries, but also because it does not hide reality.

Headline: "Ghostship" sinks
Author: Krystal Alvarez
&nbsp;
"Ghost Ship" sails away without, among other things, a plot. With a notable cast and amazing effects, this little horror flick seemed to have it all, which proves that looks can be deceiving. 

"Ghost Ship" starts off with one hell of a horrifying scene in an Italian cruise ship in 1962. The scene introduces yet another scary ghost child to the movie's pantheon, Katie, played by newcomer Emily Browning. Movie-years pass before the audience is introduced to a motley salvage crew, recruited by  Canadian Air Force pilot Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington), to reclaim the phantom-infected ship. The fairly stellar cast includes Juliana Margulies as the residential girl hero and Gabriel Byrne as the responsible Captain Sean. 

Needless to say the movie is filled with ghosts wanting their chance in the limelight. 

But the endless amount of gore and innovative special effects doesn't make up for the lack of plot. When the story finally came to something and the big secret was revealed, there was an echo of whispers throughout in the theatre, where a bunch of confused adults sat wondering where they had gone wrong, why they didn't understand. The revelation only makes it all seem more muddled.

"Ghost Ship" has about the same substance as a theme park attraction and would have a lot of commercial appeal. But then again, who's looking for cinematic integrity in a haunted house on the sea? "Ghost Ship" is forever condemned to be a Halloween rerun on TBS but for those viewers who love to see bloodshed, violence and brief nudity this is a Halloween treat; as for those looking for an Oscar winning ship film, rent "Titanic."

Headline: Atmospheric "Ring" fits horror formula
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
I have to get this out of the way: this movie is badly titled. "The Ring," a remake of "Ringu," a Japanese horror film released in 1998, is not actually about a ring but about an unmarked, mysterious cassette tape that brings doom upon whoever decides to watch it. The tape is a random collection of creepy images, including a strange looking ring of light against a dark background. 

Once an individual watches the "the video," the nearest phone rings and what sounds like an old lady says, in her most parched voice: "Seven days."

The only way to grease up a movie for a smooth opening weekend is to promise stunning special effects or a decent plot. Neither of these are anywehre to be seen. 

This movie fails to set itself apart from the endless racks of flicks that stock up the "horror genre." The characters are distant and unreal and the dialogue riddled with enough quick quips and senseless remarks to cause major strain in the eyes from inevitable, incessant rolling.

"The Ring" begins with an easily identifiable scene. A young girl invites her friend over for the night. 

The two are alone in the shadowy house, and the girl tells her friend of the video she watched and how she is supposed to die by that night. The scene is a tired rendition of the "first death" in the scary movie, the gruesome horror shot that sets the movie into motion. The girl is found dead of fright in the closet, and her friend is taken off to a mental hospital.

Although not spectacular, the special effects are used tastefully. The movie echoes a home video texture reminiscent of movies like "The Blair Witch Project," but the appearance of the evil force behind the tape in the pivotal part of the movie is well crafted. 

I admit that at this moment I was clinging to the plastic arms of my theatre seat, until, of course, the poor soul that ended up facing this evil force acts according to cliché, eliminating all traces of suspense. 

Many of the moments that seem to indicate suspense do not coincide with the actual scary moments of the story.  

The director seems to take too much delight in startling the audience superficially. In quiet moments, a sharp noise will leap out of nowhere, stealing nearly all the excitement before any action. When those parts that demanded more of a response finally flash onto the screen, I could offer no more than an impatient half-yawn.

If you have a hot date that will be prone to clinging to you for aid from the evil monsters during the formulaic scary moments, this flick is for you. 

If you wish to revive your distaste for badly acted horror and find yourself closing your eyes during moments of empty suspense, then, this movie is also for you. 

Unfortunately, "The Ring" fails to venture out of the deeply trenched scary movie format.
