Headline: Softball falls in close games to Kentucky, Illinois State; scores 13 to beat FAMU
Author: Andres Cordero/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU softball team began their 2004 campaign in sloppy fashion due to continuous rain and a lack of offense. The Golden Panthers hosted the Diamond Fun & Sun Classic, which began Friday night and saw FIU drop its season opener against Kentucky in a game that was stopped short on Friday and continued on Saturday due to intermittent rainfall. 

That performance was followed by a second defeat on Saturday to Illinois, a squad FIU had beaten in its last four meetings. 

After a rain cancellation of the FIU-Auburn match-up, the FIU women found their first victory of the season in a 13-5 rout of Florida A&M on Sunday to start the season 1-2.

Jan. 31 - Game One - UK 3, FIU 2 (8 Innings)

The Golden Panthers were unable to provide enough run support for pitcher Amanda Nealer, who tossed six shutout innings, in a 3-2 extra-inning loss to the Wildcats on Saturday at University Park.

After two and a half scoreless innings on Friday, Nealer picked up where she left off on Saturday morning, allowing only two hits in the game. 

Jacque Vetters put the Golden Panthers on the scoreboard first when the centerfielder singled to right, bringing home second baseman Lindsay Tippings.

Nealer left the game after the sixth, clinging to a 1-0 lead, and was replaced by sophomore Nicole Barrett in the seventh.

FIU ran into trouble, however, as a fielding error by freshman shortstop Tabitha Embry proved to be costly, allowing UK's Emily Marks to reach first base safely. Lori Melchi, pinch running for Marks, then reached second base on a groundout. 

Barrett then allowed a two-out single to left by Jessica Nance, scoring Melchi and tying the game at one.

FIU pulled ahead for a second time in extra innings with an off-the-wall doubleby Embry that brought Tippings home for the second time in the game, giving FIU a 2-1 lead entering the bottom half of the eighth.

Barrett, who led the nation in saves (11) last year, failed to close out the game, allowing an off-the-wall RBI double to Brooke Marnitz and then a game-winning RBI single by Amy Kendall, giving the Wildcats the 3-2 victory.

"The girls were up since 6 a.m. on Saturday [and] that's not ideal," Gwydir said. 

"I'm not making an excuse. That's the reality of it."

But it was FIU's lack of offense that led to its downfall.

"We had a lot of situations where we could have scored runs and we didn't. We had the lead twice and couldn't hold it," Gwydir said.

Jan. 31 - Game Two - Illinois St. 1, FIU 0

Saturday's second game offered little in the way of hitting for the Golden Panthers as Illinois State. freshman Shannon Nicholson pitched a complete game, three-hit shutout in her first collegiate start, en route to a 1-0 FIU loss at University Park.

The one run came in the first inning on a throwing error by FIU catcher Jennifer Powell. Redbird left fielder Randi Patton tried tagging up from third on a right field pop out by second baseman Kate Stake. Patton headed for home, but turned back to third as Powell received the throw from right fielder Brittany Witherow. Powell tried to get Patton on her way back to third, but her throw landed in left field and an opportunistic Patton scored.

The 1-0 game was the second straight loss for FIU despite senior Kendra Laminack's six innings of a five-hit, one run ball. Laminack took the loss despite allowing no earned runs. Nealer closed the game with a hitless inning and struck one out. The FIU offense was a combined 3-for-24 at the plate and FIU's top six hitters in the lineup went a combined 0-for-16.

"We had runners in scoring position all day against Illinois and we couldn't score. We had zero strikeouts, so we were putting the ball in play. When you look at a game like that, it means you're hitting it right at people."

FIU fell to 0-2 with the loss.

Feb. 1 - FIU 13, FAMU 5 (5 Innings) 

In their highest scoring game since defeating New Mexico State 15-0 last year, FIU finally came out swinging in their third game with eight hits- - (one more than the two previous games combined) - and 13 runs leading to a 13-5 rout of the Rattlers on Sunday. 

Barrett got the start for FIU, but struggled, allowing four runs in the second inning. Laminack replaced Barrett in the third and was credited with the win after allowing only one hit and one run in 2.1 innings of work. Laminack improved to 1-1 on the year.

"Kendra pitched exceedingly well the whole weekend, as well as Amanda Nealer. I was very happy with those two," Gwydir said.

FIU blew a scoreless game open with a five-run second inning assisted by three FAMU errors.

After allowing FAMU to pull to within 5-4, FIU scored one more run in the third and erupted for seven more in the fifth inning, forcing the game to be called due to the Mercy Rule.

Seven different players batted in runs for FIU led by senior first baseman Cindy Turek, who had two RBI. 

Senior Jennifer Owens (3-for-4, RBI, two runs) also led the FIU hitting attack.

The game would be the last of the tournament as the FIU-Auburn and Kentucky-Illinois State match-ups were canceled due to rain. 

This week, FIU hosts the Delong FIU Invitational where they'll face their two toughest opponents thus far in No. 10 Georgia and No. 13 Oregon on Feb. 6. 

Gwydir expects a both top-ranked teams to present a tough challenge.

"We don't surprise people anymore. I think they know who we are and we see their best pitchers," Gwydir said.

Headline: Baseball 'rattled' to start off season
Subheadline: FIU drops two games Saturday, comes back with vengeance Sunday vs. FAMU
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On a rainy weekend at University Park Stadium, FIU got its 2004 season off to a rough start, dropping both games of a Saturday doubleheader after Friday night's opener was cancelled due to rain. It was the first time the Golden Panthers have lost to the FAMU Rattlers since Feb. 16, 1998. However, they got their revenge on Sunday afternoon, clobbering the Rattlers 19-5 to improve their record to 1-2 on the season.

Jan. 31 - Game One - FAMU 7, FIU 2

Making his first appearance for FIU,  pitcher Mark Worrell started off strong, but allowed a devastating three-run homer in the fourth inning, leading to a 7-2 loss to FAMU in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader.

Worrell, a junior, struck out two of the first three batters he faced and totaled six for the day. He went 5.2 innings on the mound, giving up only two hits and walking one, but one of the two hits he allowed proved to be costly.

"We were one pitch away.  If you take that homerun [Worrell allowed], that's one pitch, but that's what baseball comes down to," head coach Danny Price said.

FIU got off to a good start in the first inning. Junior Dennis Diaz was hit by a Jamil Knight pitch and advanced to second on a single by sophomore Bryan Pullin. The next batter, sophomore Mike Lopez, laid down a bunt, which was thrown away by Knight, scoring Diaz and giving FIU a 1-0 lead. Junior Jeff Skellenger added a sacrifice fly to score Pullin, putting the Golden Panthers up 2-0.

The Rattlers got back in the game in the fourth inning when Worrell walked Chris Lee and David Hampton reached first on a throwing error by FIU catcher Adrian Casanova. After getting Todd Rodman to ground out, Worrell allowed a three-run homerun to Virgil Priestly, giving FAMU a 3-2 lead. 

"That homerun was a big factor, but we just never got the hit at the right time. The ball just didn't bounce our way the whole day it seemed," said pitcher Derek DeCarlo, who allowed two earned runs in 1.1 innings in relief of Worrell. 

Sophomore Jon Banke tossed the final two innings for FIU, allowing two runs and one hit. 

FIU's middle of the lineup (Skellenger, Brian Aragon, Casanova) were a combined 0 for 10 at the plate as the FAMU pitching allowed only five hits in the contest.

Jan. 31 - Game Two - FAMU 7, FIU 4

FIU, still looking for its first win of the season, fell short again, this time 7-4 to FAMU in the second game of Saturday's doubleheader.

"We have never lost a series to them, so for us to lose to them, it does hurt; it hurts right in your stomach man," said pitcher Andrew Edwards, a senior.

Things didn't start off well for the Golden Panthers as FAMU shortstop Brian Braxton hit a one-out, first inning homer off FIU pitcher Denny Hernandez to give the Rattlers the early lead. 

But FIU answered back in the bottom of the first when Skellenger knocked home  Diaz with a single to right field, knotting the game at one.

Denny Hernandez ran into trouble again in the second when FAMU outfielder John Hengehold tripled home Jay Drayton, putting FAMU up 2-1. FIU's offense responded with two runs in the bottom half of the inning when Bryan Pullin and freshman Eduardo Davila connected on RBI singles to give the Golden Panthers a 3-2 lead. 

With FIU trailing 3-2 in the sixth, Luis Rivera (2-for-2, two runs) hit his second double of the game and then stole third. Davila followed with a sacrifice bunt down the first base line, scoring Rivera and tying the game. Things went downhill, for FIU in the seventh. 

Luis Gazitua recorded outs on the first two batters he faced, but then ran into control problems, allowing two walks and a single before hitting Priestly with the bases loaded, tying the game at four. Gazitua then walked FAMU catcher Chris Branning to give FAMU a 5-4 lead. Danny Hernandez then entered the game in relief of Gazitua, but was greeted with an RBI single by FAMU third baseman Dan Flaherty, making the score 6-4.

FAMU added another run in the ninth and FIU left three runners on base in the final two innings to close out the game.

"We came out too sluggish. We came out like we were 15 games into the season already," said Edwards.

"We have to come in and start playing hard ball from inning one on."

Feb. 1 - FIU 19, FAMU 5

After scoring only seven runs in two games on Saturday, FIU responded with 19 on Sunday, overcoming two consecutive losses and defeating the Rattlers 19-5.

Making his first appearance since recovering from an arm injury last season, senior Edwards came out with a strong performance, allowing only three runs and two hits in five innings.

"I felt real good today. I mean just the energy, after we dropped two yesterday, you know, it was kind of bad. Everybody felt bad and you know to lose to a team like FAMU, was just, on our caliber, not cutting it." But we came out today with a lot of intensity and my arm felt real good," Edwards said after the game.

But things didn't go as smoothly as Edwards would have liked in the early going, as Priestly connected on his second three-run homer of the weekend, giving FAMU the early 3-0 lead.

FIU rallied in the second inning, bringing home five runs - three off of walks by FAMU pitcher A.J Patrick, giving the Golden Panthers a 5-3 lead that they would never relinquish. FIU added 10 more runs over the next three innings, highlighted by a solo homerun by sophomore Mike Lopez.

Nine Golden Panthers hit safely in the game and five (Lopez, Brian Aragon, Skellenger, Davila and Rivera) had multi-hit games.

Rivera led the offensive assault, going 3-for-5 with two RBI and two runs.

"I really felt our guys did a great job working the count and working themselves into hitters' situations, hitters' counts, and I saw really good, big improvement there, you know. I thought that was the biggest thing we did," Price said.

Junior right-hander Derek Antelo relieved Edwards in the sixth, allowing two runs in two innings, and Frank Gonzalez and Edgar Ramirez combined to shut FAMU out in the final two innings to preserve the win.

After losing two games to a FAMU team that FIU was 45-7 against prior to this weekend, Price saw lots of room for improvement.

"Everything's gotta be turned up a little bit. The flame has gotta be turned up a little bit. And this is gonna be a great work week for us. I think we learned a lot," Price said.

Added Price: "A lot of the mistakes we made this week, we certainly are gonna work on them."
