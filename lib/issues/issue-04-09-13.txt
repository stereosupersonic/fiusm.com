Headline: Attempts at dry campus debated
Author: Peter Zachariadis / Special To The Beacon
&nbsp;
Ask any college student at Florida International University what the legal age is to knock down a beer in the state, and the likely response is "21."

Probe further and ask if students understand the intricacies of FIU's rules concerning use of and distribution of alcohol on campus, and you'll probably be met by silence.

Pi Kappa Alpha (PKA) fraternity chapter president Manny Niebla says he understands the Alcoholic Beverages Rule (Rule 6C8-11.005 adopted by the FIU Board of Trustee), which contains the requirements for the use, consumption, service, and sale of alcohol at the University.

The 20-something and his fraternity brothers will be just the second Greek organization with on-campus housing sometime in late fall. For Niebla, knowing the rules about alcohol on campus affects his fraternity directly.

"Overseeing a fraternity chapter of 40 or so college students gives you an edge," Niebla says. 

"All events have to be planned out for safety concerns with checklists for troubleshooting. Events where the fraternity plans to serve alcohol need to be approved by advisors and administration officials. Sometimes the events are supervised as well, with visits from an advisor to make sure no rules are being violated," he adds.

According to Niebla, finding responsible pledges is part of the solution to alcohol awareness.  

"Prospective members who think they'll join a fraternity to find a keg party every Friday are in for a big surprise," he says.  

"We stay away from those guys...over two or three months of spending time together you can gauge who is going to be a problem," Niebla said.

Niebla, who will end his term as chapter president after the fall semester, looks at the opening of the PKA fraternity house with pride, still knowing there's much at stake.

"Our fraternity is going to be under some stringent rules," he says. "One of them might be living in an alcohol-free house." 

The reasons for such stringent rules remain clear to the members, though.  

"PKA's national office could revoke a fraternity charter for four years because of an alcohol-related infraction," Niebla says. "Then there's university punishment coupled with legal punishment. It all adds up to too much trouble for the sake of a few drinks." 

For a college of more than 30,000 students in a major metropolitan area, alcohol related crime remains low at FIU. According to crime statistics for 2002, there was only one incident where Public Safety made an arrest for an alcohol-related crime.

That same year, housing recorded 29 separate alcohol-related incidents. 

A year earlier, only 11 incidents were recorded. Sixteen liquor law violations were sent to Judicial and Mediation Services in 2002.

Ron Thompson, the assistant Director of Residential Life, acknowledged that from time to time students break the rules where alcohol is concerned. 

However, if they're caught drinking outside their rooms or having a party where alcohol is being served to minors, action is swift and decisive.

FIU policy strictly forbids alcohol consumption by those of legal age outside of their housing units and at Gracie's Grill.   

Students under 21-years-of-age are never allowed to drink alcohol at FIU or anywhere in the state of Florida. 

"Housing students get a check-in package with rules about alcohol use when they first move into Housing.  Resident Assistants also go over alcohol policy informally with students at the beginning of the term," he said.

The disciplinary actions are also explained to them in length.

"For first time offenders, a meeting is scheduled to fully explore the events leading up to the infraction. Second offenses could include parental notification if the offender is a minor or a judicial procedure if the matter is more serious. After that, further violations are likely to be met with a punitive response," he adds.

Thompson attributes most of the alcohol-related infractions in housing to boredom and social circumsantces. 

"Students never think they'd get into trouble because they believe they're immune to the consequences," Thompson said. 

Some parts of campus, however, are not bound by the drinking regulations.

Happy hour at FIU is relegated to one locale, in which students are forbidden to consume alcohol at any location other than Gracie's. 

The Rathskeller is similar to the communal area for students found on every campus. 

"It's a place to grab a bite to eat, play dominoes, watch television, or meet friends for a beer. Thursday and Friday nights are most popular," Niebla says. 

He and other Greeks meet there for a beer before meetings. 

Sporting events will pack people in as well, he says. 

"But it's a way to socialize, not to go on a abender," Niebla added.

For sports fans, the only area where drinking is allowed around Community Stadium is in the designated tailgating area. 

"There's no way we should be advocating a dry campus," says Jesse Campbell, chief of Public Safety. 

"Taking away the only place where students can drink legally might cause some students to drink in secret or drink illegally," he says. "FIU needs a place where students and faculty can socialize if they choose."

According to statistics by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 1,400 college students die from unintentional alcohol-related injuries. About 500,000 more suffer unintentional injuries due to alcohol. 

The study also shows that about 600,000 college students nationwide suffer assaults from other students under the influence of alcohol. Seventy thousand of those assaults are sexual in nature and involve alcohol.

Jennifer Mwaisela, the 2003-2004 chair of the Substance Abuse Taskforce, says she has a challenging job in promoting awareness about alcohol in a college of 30,000 plus.

When the Golden Panthers began playing football in 2002, Substance Abuse Taskforce proposed that alcohol not be served in the Community Stadium. The University Administration supported the proposal despite some resistance. 

"The goal of the FIU Substance Abuse Taskforce is to promote and encourage safe, healthy and responsible behaviors,"  Mwaisela said. 

"Fun is good, fun is important, fun is necessary. However, alcohol is not essential for our students to enjoy the various activities they plan to attend," she said.

Headline: Surviving on-campus boredom
Author: Reynard Alli and Danny Muela / Contributing Writers
&nbsp;
It's a typical afternoon on a typical day, and typically you are bored and wandering around campus looking to end your descent into madness. 

Either you scheduled your classes too far apart or the professors decided to offer the only courses available for your major in some horrible configuration involving you getting here at 7 a.m. and not leaving until 5 p.m. 

We have come up with an assortment of things that will either keep you entertained or get you arrested in the process. 				

THE BOOKSTORE

Known for expensive books, expensive coffee and expensive books (yes, it had to be said twice), many don't realize that the upstairs coffee shop is a perfect place to just sit and chat, depending on how popular you are. The coffee smell is pleasant, you can always grab a book or magazine, and not to mention all the reading material is free. Perfect for the cheap, college students.			Gracie's Grill  

 Gracie's is half of the Rathskeller. The other half was the pool hall/game room that should have also made this list of things to do, except we don't know where the pool hall went. 

The other reason to go there is because it is a grill and sports bar, which means they serve food fresh off the grill and the only place on campus to get beer. There are also televisions all over the place. If you are looking for a slightly intimate atmosphere then this is the

place to be. 

BUSTING OUT 

But, you know what? We get freaking sick of this campus sometimes. Let's say that you want to eat a buffet-sized meal but you either don't like the Fresh Food Company menu or just don't want to spend six bucks for garbanzo bean surprise when all you are really going to eat is the pizza. 

So, right down the street you've got a Pizza Hut. Where from 12:30 to 2:30 you can lay down the same six bucks and get a greater variety of pizza, along with salad and various other stereotypical Italian dishes like pasta and James Gandolfini. Nearby is also a China buffet which is always good. I mean you'll be hungry an hour later, but by then you'll be in class.	Class Sampling  

Ever get bored of your own classes? Well then, guest star in your friend's classes. Show up, take notes, ask questions, if you're really good you can even take the tests just to see how you would do. 

Not all teachers allow this and we are not even sure if the university allows it, but let us tell you from experience it sure is fun and educational at the same time.		

VISTING HOURS

Speaking of professors, whether you know it or not they are some of the loneliest individuals on the planet. They love it when anyone comes to visit them. You may be surprised what they have to say. They actually have senses of humor and can carry a conversation without preaching or trying to impale you with a Sharpie. So hey, they have office hours for a reason right? Take advantage.                                         	

GOOD OL' GREEN LIBRARY

Most people know about the books (at least we hope they do). But most do not know about the wonders of the fifth floor. You can actually check out movies, CDs and records for free! You can listen to them right there or take them home for free! And you can also use the computers there for - you get the point. Remember your tuition's paying for this, so use it, damn it!

Despite the fact that we may sound like a couple of PR agents for FIU, we just want you to know that we are just two individuals who have suffered through a fate that has been handed out to all college students: boredom. 

In fact, in this quest to alleviate our boredom we have become better at finding things to keep ourselves entertained rather than actually using the university for it's intended purpose. So if any of these things sound boring or uninteresting to you, you can always - God forbid - do your homework, study, or here's a novel idea: go to your own classes. 

In closing, boredom sucks, but flunking out of school and working as a door-to-door champagne salesman sucks even more, believe us.

Headline: Swimming team ready to kick with scrimmage
Author: Yanely Perez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After welcoming the first ever women's swim team at FIU in 2003, this year, both swimmers and divers set high goals for themselves in improving their results. 

With many returning players, coach and Olympic medalist Noemi Zaharia is counting on the veterans to lead the team.

Coach Zaharia is hoping this year's FIU will be an even stronger team and be able to compete and win in finals. 

"To my knowledge, this year's team is much stronger than last years. Therefore, my expectations for competition are good considering the fact that there are returning players, who know just what being a part of a team means," said Zaharia. "I look forward to improving our results from last season and have two women qualify for the NCAA Finals Championship."

The team kicks off the season in a friendly blue and gold scrimmage on Oct. 9. The first meet will take place on Oct. 16 against cross-town rival Miami at Coral Gables. The first home meet will take place on Oct. 29 against Princeton.

For being a new program last year, the swim team accomplished more than a usual rookie team. 

Last year's swim team finished fourth in the Sun Belt Conference, meaning numbers should improve with a returning team.

Athletic Director Rick Mello sees last year's success a key to the team's bright future ahead.

"From what I observed last season, this year's Women's Swimming and Diving program will be able to build more depth and I wouldn't be surprised if they finished number one in the conference championships in about one or two years," said Mello. "Therefore, this can only mean that this year's team is being depended on for a magnificent successful year."

Key returning players include Claudia Barsi, who finished sixth in the European Championship. 

There is also returning diver, Megan Balkenbush and Tiffany Haynes who will be swimming in various events including free, back, and fly. 

The returning freshman class from last season includes Victoria Molnar, Carly Crandall, and Sarah Perfetti.

The first invitational for the team will be on Nov. 19 where Zaharia's team will participate in the Nike Invitational. FIU will host its first invitational on Jan. 9 against Carneigie Mellon and Tulane. 

The NCAA championships will take place during mid March. This is where Coach Zaharia wants part of her team to be, come spring time. Last season many players attended and with one year under their belt, Zaharia expects big things.

&nbsp;
FIU 3, Texas State 1

The team picked up the first win of the season with a score of 3-1 over Texas State on Sept. 5. The victory raises the season record to one win and three loses. 

During the second half Mid fielder Janessa Taddei scored and was followed by another goal by Forward Janet Ligouri.

 Less than two minutes later, Texas scored their only goal that was later counter attacked by Janessa Taddei who scored in the 84th minute. 

The goalkeeper did not face much action by Texas State as Madeline Gannon had two saves. Texas State out shot FIU in the first half shooting seven shots compared to one by FIU. FIU was out shot 12 to five in total but still managed to pick up the victory with key goals, as Texas State had not saved shots.

FIU Head Coach Everton Edwards picked up career win 150, all which are with the Golden Panthers.

Texas 5, FIU 0

Despite the eight shots against Texas, the team lost 5-0 on Sept. 3 at Myers Stadium. 

Defender Yaneash Donaldson and Forward Tamara Kochen each had two attempts on goal but failed to score.

Kochen credited the play of Texas, which was superior despite FIU's effort.

"They are top ten, very talented and skillful. We tried our best and gave a good effort but it wasn't enough," said Kochen.

Florida State 4, FIU 1

 After a tie during the first half, the Seminoles made three goals in the second half of the game on Aug. 29. 

On a pass by Chanelle Crosby, Ligouri scored the lone goal for the Golden Panthers. Goalkeepers, Gannon and Carly Agro combined for five saves.

UCF 2, FIU 1

Headline: Volleyball team suffers fourth loss in a row
Author: Ashley Butler / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It wasn't all about winning this weekend for FIU's Women's Volleyball, but about individual player's career-highs.  

The Golden Panthers' record dropped to 0-4 after playing in the Ocean National Bank Invitational at Lundholm Gymnasium in New Hampshire on Sept. 3-4. The team lost all three matches.

Despite the three loses, many Golden Panthers received individual awards.  At least five of the players received their all time career-highs in this tournament alone. Some of the girls include: 

Juniors Laura Vogel and Anna Dmowska had 12 kills each, while Vogel also had five service aces, and Dmowska contributed 10 digs for a double-double. 

Dyionna Smith who sat out last season as a medical red shirt due to a wrist injury, had her career-high with 45 assists and 17 digs. Freshman Heather Huber led FIU with 12 kills.  Junior Lauren Stahoski had a startling career-high of 21 digs in her first match alone.

The Golden Panthers kept it close in game one.  Oksana Zabalueva  put FIU slightly ahead 27-26 with two straight aces, but after a side out, the Wildcats had three consecutive kills that contributed to the win for the University of New Hampshire.

The team hit a season-high .419 for the second game and committed only two small attack errors on their way to the victory.  

Senior Myriam Rodney led the team with four kills while Dmowska, Vogel, and Huber each had three. The final score was 30-22.

In game three UNH once again, took the lead with a 30-37 win.  Even though the Golden Panthers' started out in the lead 9-3, the Wildcats caught up when player Natasha Otte had five kills on seven attacks.

FIU took an early lead 4-3 in game four. The two teams stayed pretty much neck-in-neck until UNH started to play off of FIU's 21 total service errors in the game to win 30-25. 

FIU also suffered losses to Toledo in the tournament and Arizona State.

Toledo defeated FIU 3-0 and Arizona State won 3-1.

UM 3, FIU 0

The Golden Panthers suffered a disappointing 3-0 loss to the Miami Hurricanes on Sept. 1 at the Pharmed Arena.

It was the first game for the ladies who have a relatively new team on the floor.

"The girls were just too nervous which is understandable because of the team being so young," said Head Coach Cookie Stevens.

The Hurricanes started the game off with a quick 7-0 lead.  Sophomore Oksana Zabalueva who led the Golden Panthers with eight kills gave FIU the first point.  Unable to catch up, the Golden Panthers lost the first set 30-17 in game one to UM.  

In the second set FIU and UM were tied at six different times.  FIU's only lead was early on at 3-2.  Even though block specialist Danielle Dubetz had five total blocks (alone) in the set, the Hurricanes defeated FIU 30-24.

The Golden Panthers started off well in the third set with a 4-3 lead.  But, shortly after Miami quieted FIU with a 14-2 stretch and defeated FIU 30-14 in the set.

After the loss, Stevens knows what she will need to do in order to improve her team.

"The main thing we need to focus on is ball control. We also need to work on our passing and receiving, as well as serving a lot tougher," said Stevens who wants her team to be aggressive and put the ball away."   "I'm still trying to find the right combination of girls to play. We're trying new things and playing different groups of girls," Stevens said.

Headline: All-Star Marlin
Subheadline: Former Golden Panther enjoys life as a World Series winner but the road to success involved dedication and importance of graduating
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Growing up in Miami, Mike Lowell dreamed of becoming a Major League Player. Lowell began accomplishing his dream in 1995 when the New York Yankees drafted him out of Florida International University. Little did Lowell know that he would later be traded to the Florida Marlins and we all know the story from there.

Lowell arrived in Miami and quickly became a fan favorite. He stayed with the Marlins through four straight losing seasons before helping turn the team around in 2003 and win the World Series Championship.

Life has changed for Lowell since Josh Beckett finished off the Yankees in game six. Lowell who is now recognized everywhere he goes, carries an over-sized championship ring with over 100 diamonds, and was awarded a contract exceeding $30 million. 

With the season in full swing and the Marlins in the hunt for the wild card, Lowell found time to discuss pro baseball, his time at FIU, rapper DMX, and the preparation needed to face ace pitches like Randy Johnson and Roger Clements.

Q: You were here when the Marlins were having consecutive losing seasons and fans were not going out to the stadium. How did it feel to play in the World Series with crowds exceeding 60,00 fans?

We got a huge advantage that we never had, not even during the season. It provided a totally different atmosphere which the teams that played us during the year weren't used to that atmosphere when they got here. We got a big home field advantage and it was very exciting, this stadium gets very loud when we have 30,000, 40,000 and you put it at 60,000, 65,000 and root for you that can only help you.

Q: How has your life changed since the World Series?

I think that from a baseball standpoint you accomplish something that everyone tries to accomplish. You see some of the greatest players in baseball like Barry Bonds and Albert Pojuls and all they talk about is how they want to win a World Series and the fact that we did that, it's a big  under your cap that you can say you accomplished something. 

Locally you get recognized a lot more but its usually positive feedback from people saying we went to game four or game five and it was great and that's nice to hear.

Q: What are the types of things that run through your mind, if any, when you step into the batter box and you are facing top pitches like Roger Clemens or Randy Johnson?

I try not to think of anything. The pitches are coming so fast that if you think of something else you have no chance. I just try to tell myself to see it and react because if you are thinking about your stride or your bat or your hand or something the ball is going to be right by you. 

The simpler you can make it you try not to think, just to react. We have so much practice in batting practice where you try to just have those instincts and I just try to see it and hit it hard.

Q: You have an option to opt out of your contract at the end of this season. If the Marlins cannot come to an agreement of a stadium but stays competitive by keeping catcher Paul Lo Doca and pitcher Carl Pavano among others, do you stay with the Marlins?

Well I would definitely want to sit down with the ownership and see what their plan is long term and you know I wouldn't want to come back for one year and later be traded in July because I don't have any years after that. 

I've always said I wanted to play in Miami my whole career but I wouldn't want to have a big salary, which doesn't allow us to get people to so that we can be competitive or without the stadium we don't have the revenue to be competitive. If I believe the Marlins will be, I wouldn't mind coming back but I haven't really giving it much thought I just want to finish the season and see what happens.

Q: What are your fondest memories of FIU baseball Head Coach Danny Price?

The main thing with Danny Price is that he gave me a chance to play since my freshman year. I was struggling a little bit and after practice he told me to just relax, you're going to be fine. You know as a freshman you want to prove you can play and he put a lot of confidence in me before he ever saw me play in a regular game. 

I think he really enjoyed the 1995 team we had, I think it was a fun year. It was the year we had to play our home games at homestead and it was kind of a distraction but I think it brought us close together and I think it was a year he enjoyed and I did too.

Q: You were the recipient of the Trans American Athletic Conference's student athlete of the year in 1995. Was it difficult to manage being a full time student while playing collegiate ball at the same time?

Yeah it's hard because you practice so much but you still have to get your studies done. I think that if you budget out your time it's doable. I don't think NCAA or college makes things that are totally impossible. 

When it was time for finals to come I didn't start two days before I had to start a week to ten days before because I didn't have the same amount as time as some one else has because of the traveling and practice. There are some sacrifices you have to make but that's the price you have to pay if you want to be a student athlete.

Q: Many players are not concerned about graduating anymore, they think the younger they reach the pro level, the better their chances. You left school early but went back and graduated with a degree in finance. What advice would you give to young athletes about going pro?

Well, the problem is the money is so big for these young guys that it's hard for guys to turn it down. I would never say don't take the money but my advice would be to know that you need something to fall back on. 

I've seen a lot of guys get hurt and when you get a lot of money in one shot and is not going to last forever. You need to have something to make a career out of. I left early from FIU after my third year but, I went just because I thought it was important because I wanted to have something to fall back on. 

You look at the biggest stars today and even Shaquille O'Neal is going back to finish his degree and he has more money than he knows what to do with. It shows you that a lot of people really value what an education can do for you.

Q: Your introduction song before an at bat is "Party Up" by rapper DMX. Does this song hype you up before an at bat.

Well, I think its from Gone in Sixty Seconds and it sounded so good in the guy's car and I said man, with the sound system we have here, the beginning would sound real good. But it's more superstition, when I started putting it I got off to a good start so I said I can't turn it off now.

Headline: Complaints spur gym construction at BBC
Author: Mark Scopetta / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The building currently being constructed behind the Wolfe Center will house the Biscayne Bay new 10,000 square foot gym, which is over four times larger than the old one (2,400 square feet). The gym will be adjacent to the pool and attached to the Wolfe Center.

"We're trying to improve campus life on BBC," said Greg Olson, Director of Student Affairs.  "Currently, we are planning to break the gym up into four sections: cardio machines, weight resistance machines, free weights, and an aerobic center," Olson said.

The 1,200 square foot aerobic center will be equipped with ballet bars and floor-to-ceiling mirrors.

Reginald Lafontant, a freshman criminal justice major, who currently works in the old gym, says people are looking for locker rooms, a water fountain, and more space in the new gym; most of the other people with whom I spoke echoed these same complaints. Currently, students have to leave the gym and go down the hall to use the bathroom and there are no lockers whatsoever.  

Administrators have listened to these grievances and are planning to include male and female locker rooms fully equipped with both showers and bathrooms. There will be water fountains as well.

"I can't wait for the new gym to open up. I'm tired of the closet they call a gym," said  Rudy Dunin, a junior Finance major living in BBC. 

$1.7 million of Capital Improvement Trust Funding (CITF) has been ear marked for the outfitting of the gym. Though it's a lot of money, the $1.7 million pales in comparison to the $10 million being used for the University Park's new gym.

Lace up your shoes and ready your towels because the new gym is slated for completion in Aug.  2005.

Headline: Vice president's accomplishments shine through leadership
Author: Julia Marchese / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
His favorite food is lasagna and his favorite colors are none other than blue and gold. He credits his mother as being the biggest influence in his life. Malik Wilkes, student government vice president, aims to make students' college experience as beneficial as he possibly could.

After holding a plethora of positions within various organizations at FIU, including being SGA rep-at-large and being on the campus promotions chair for Dance Marathon, he was well prepared to fill the position of SGA vice president. 

"Knowing the ins and outs of SGA and how things get done made the transition into my current position very smooth," said Wilkes. "My other campus experiences, such as the skills I picked up as a 2003 peer advisor, gave me the communication skills that I need for a position that deals with communication everyday." 

Many of his objectives as vice president deal with lobbying to the state legislators through Florida Student Association and he plans on playing a big role in the fight against block tuition and other accelerated graduation programs. He is helping council members improve academic advising and possibly make the Breezeway Café a twenty-four hour hang out. "My main focus is to keep people motivated and to get more done," said Wilkes.

Wilkes believes in giving back to the FIU community. "It's good to know that you've done something to better student's college experience just as others have done for me," said Wilkes. His favorite saying: "When you take the elevator to the top, make sure you send it back down for the next person."

Another very positive influence in his life is his fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, also known as Pike. "The friendships and the bonds that I have gotten from being a part of my fraternity are invaluable," he said.  

He is also their vice president of recruitment. Holding a leadership position within the frat  has challenged his leadership skills. "I feel that I have grown more confident of my abilities." Wilkes hopes to leave his fraternity better than he found it.

He is participating only  in Student Government and Pi Kappa Alpha this semester. Because of his large work loads in both organizations, Wilkes has decided to cut back on his involvement that once occupied his time. "With the demands of my roles now, I know that cutting back had to happen," he said. However, he hopes to find time for the events and organizations he used to be involved with. Majoring in english, minoring in psychology and tending to his commitments at FIU leaves this sports fan little time to relax and unwind. "I like to play dominos at Gracie's Grill and read and write," said Wilkes.

As another semester begins to unfold, students vow that this term will be different; they try to convince themselves and each other that they will leave behind bad habits of procrastination, social study groups, and all-night cramming sessions. 

Although filled with commendable and ambitious goals, you quickly snap out of it upon hearing that quirky familiar ring tone of your phone.  Just as you suspected, it is your friend calling with the latest plans telling you to drop what you are doing and get over there.  

Then reality sets in, despite your noble intentions of being a model scholar this term, you are caught up with anything and everything but your actual classes. 

 Friends, significant others, family and social events, although alluring, are time consuming and distracting for most college students attempting to study.  Or are they? 

While most students prefer a quiet personal environment to study, interviews with FIU undergraduates show quite the opposite. 

Senior biology major, Berti Dieguez contends, "It is better to study in small groups because we help each other understand the difficult material at hand." FIU students and those alike have mastered the techniques of studying in animated environments.  

It gives them a chance to combine the responsibility of class work with the enjoyment of socializing. Hot spots for social study groups tend to occur throughout Graham Center, the second floor of the Green Library, and blue tables located in the backside of the library.  Studying in orderly groups could be advantageous because it facilitates a buddy system among students with similar problems.  While studying in an energetic ambiance might be appealing and stimulating to some, it can be a great disruption for others. 

Alternatives to avoiding irritating siblings at home, pesky friends and obnoxious social elites around congested campus areas are far from few. Inquiries show that FIU students tend to have similar study spots.  

Among favorites are the quiet study rooms located throughout the library, empty auditorium classrooms found in Chemistry and Physics, vacant classrooms in GC, Barnes & Noble's Café and select Starbucks locations.

Students flock to these and other locations that offer a moderately quiet zone that is conducive to intense study time and light conversation, if any at all. Other locals for keen scholarly behavior include University of Miami's Otto Richter Library and Miami Dade Public Libraries, as well as pavilions and shady calm areas found throughout our own fine campus.

Whatever the location or method you decide on for this semester, put aside some time and aspire to turn over a new leaf and actually follow through on becoming studious.

With Shaquille O'Neal now a member of the Miami Heat, basketball has never been as trendy as it presently is. However, there are some true fans in our town who eat, sleep and sing hoops.

As a youngster growing up in Westchester, his father - former El Salvador basketball star, Lorenzo "Choo Choo" Campos - introduced Juan "Night Train" Campos to the game of basketball. 

"Before I knew how to read and write, I was able to dribble between my legs and sink hook shoots. Not bad for a 8-year-old boy," gloats the younger Campos.

With ambition that can eclipse Shaq's jump shot, Campos tried out for his high school basketball team year after year, but standing at five-foot-six inches in height, he was told that he was too small to play with the bigger, heavier, and meaner boys who played in the district. The other boys relentlessly teased him for his height deficiency. "I heard it all, pipsqueak, peewee, Willow, smurf, all the short names. Kids can really be some dirty birdies sometimes."

After failing to make the team during his junior year, head basketball coach Albert Rodriguez pulled him aside and recommended he give consideration to a sport where lack of height was not such a negative, a sport such as badminton. 

The coach's suggestion did not sit well with Campos. 

"Nothing against all the badmintonians around the globe, but I play basketball and nobody is going to stop me from playing it."

What cannot be measured in inches is the dedication and determination Juan Campos has for the game. 

"To me, basketball isn't just a game, it's my way of life. I don't like going to the park and playing with a bunch of people who don't take the game seriously, that really makes me want to shout." 

Not being a member of the school team or leagues organized for a boy his age, his  basketball dreams were fading.

As he worked on his hook shots one night at a local park, a few players from the girls' basketball team showed up in search of some action. Familiar with his struggles to make the boys' team and thought of as a pushover because of his size, the girls challenged him to play.

"When I see that I'm seen as inferior because of my height, I get really angry and like a machine, the switch goes on, I shout and I'm like a rabbit in a forest fire." Apparently, he beat each girl one-on-one and in a game of H-O-R-S-E. 

Even after easily defeating the female players, they still teased him about not being suitable for the boys' team. Feeling a lack of respect by the female players, Campos has shifted his entire focus to playing against females only. 

"I don't know why they have to hate, but now they're on the tracks and the train's coming full steam." 

There have been those who say that what he's doing is degrading, but Campos feels his cause is just. 

"It's fair, they're still usually taller than I am, so it simply boils down to who wants to win more and that's when I take it to the next level."

The self-proclaimed "Inter-Gender Hoops Champ" he plays four to five games against top ranking high school and college females in the area. He claims that some females give him all he can handle, but he is still undefeated. 

"I've been doing this for about 5 months, and I've yet to drink from the loser's cup. If any girl thinks she can lace them up and battle with me, then my message to them is simply: Bring it!" boasts Campos.

With a regime that has him awake at five in the morning for a three-mile jog and three hundred hook shots at the park, he definitely makes it tough for one to compete against him. 

He takes day classes and has a part-time job, his playing is all done at night, which is where his nickname "Night Train" stems from. 

"My dad played a big role in my passion for basketball and being referred to as a train, like he was is. .a great honor."
