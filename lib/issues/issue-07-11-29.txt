Headline: Achieving to the green standard: Task force strives to incorporate eco-friendly measures in buildings

Former Vice Provost Raul Moncarz remembers the Biscayne Bay Campus in 1972 when watching crabs cross the street was an everyday occurrence.

"There were less buildings, less students, less cars, and less pollution," Moncarz said.

The campus consisted of the Hospitality Management Building, formerly the Trade Center, and trailers that are near the Library. 

Within the last few years, BBC has witnessed even more changes to the campus, including the HM Building's renovations, construction of the Marine Sciences building and the new cafeteria and fitness center.

According to David Fonseca, BBC's Student Government Council's Environmental Correspondent, "you really can't see [the pollution], but it's there." 

Of course, new construction is going to affect the wildlife at the campus. Every type of construction is going to affect the wildlife - you're taking up their space," Fonseca said. 

Squirrels can be seen scrounging the garbage cans, which means that something is eating away at their natural food source."

Florida International University President Modesto A. Maidique signed the American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment on May 25, where he pledged to achieve "climate neutrality," or a zero greenhouse gas footprint at FIU.

To adhere to his ACUPCC pledge, Maidique has created an environmental committee, the President's Climate Commitment Task Force. 

According to Charles Scurr, committee chair, the task force is in charge of "creating institutional structures to guide the development and implementation of the plan" laid out to achieve climate neutrality according to the pledge's rules.

"The commitment includes a set of guidelines," Scurr wrote  in an e-mail. "This includes a comprehensive inventory of all greenhouse gas emissions, actions to make climate neutrality and sustainability a part of the curriculum, and a target date for achieving climate neutrality as soon as possible."

The commitment also calls for other measures, including achieving a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Silver Standard and a "green" building rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council for building construction. Other changes include the implementation of Energy Star certified products and the generation of at least 15 percent of the electricity produced by FIU's structures from renewable sources.

Fonseca said SGC-BBC is trying to ensure the LEED Silver Standard. 

Changes can be seen in the new buildings that come equipped with energy efficient fluorescent light bulbs and water-efficient showerheads in the student residence buildings. 

SGC-BBC is also working on providing the University with energy from solar panels.

"By changing our shower heads to water-efficient ones, light bulbs to energy-efficient ones, and switching to solar panel energy, we will construct "greener" buildings and help the ecosystem at BBC," Fonseca said.

Victor Citarella, associate vice president of Facilities Management for the University, and Damian Fernandez, University Vice Provost, were not available for comment despite several attempts to contact them.

Headline: Alumna gets to publish work into a novel
Author: Wilma Hernandez /Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Florida International University Alumna Lynn K. Bonasia's first novel, Some Assembly Required, will be published in June 2008.

Set in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the story details how a former writer of instruction manuals and a recovering alcoholic try to assemble new lives and solve a 30-year old mystery of a teenage boy's disappearance. 

Bonasia graduated from FIU in 2005 with a Master in Fine Arts in creative writing but had already begun the book in 2002 during a novel writing class. Originally titled Washashores, Bonasia continued working on it as her MFA thesis project. 

"The unfinished manuscript collected dust for a couple of years while I continued school," Bonasia said. "I have discipline in writing, but there are always distractions such as the e-mail icon, clients needing ads, my kid, phone calls, and a cat that likes to rest her head on my escape button."

The piece, then incomplete, was a finalist in the James Jones First Novel Fellowship competition in 2003. Bonasia said that to her surprise she was asked to write 50 more pages. 

"There is nothing like potential fame, glory and a $10,000 prize to serve as impetus to finish a book," Bonasia said. "In the end, I didn't win."

Although she admits to having some bad writing days, writers' block is not a choice. A full-time mother to 16 year old son John and wife of 19 years to Jeff, Bonasia tries to write in the morning when her ideas are fresher and commits at least four hours before she takes a break to walk her dog.

"When you write for a living, you don't have the luxury of having writer's block," Bonasia said. "The only hard time I have is when I step away from a project for too long, and then it takes me some time to get back into it." 

Bonasia, who earned a bachelor degree in journalism from the University of Massachusetts, said journalism taught her how to write fast. Born in 1962 in Teaneck, New Jersey, she has published fiction in The Miami Herald, Miami Street, Omni, and The Seattle Review. 

Her poetry was published in an anthology of Cape Cod writers, World of Water, World of Sand, where she won first prize at The Cape Codder's poetry contest in summer of 2000.

"The best part of writing is when the characters become real to you and their stories unfurl organically. That's the magic that keeps writers going." Bonasia said.

In addition to writing, Bonasia has been in advertising for 15 years. She has freelanced as an advertising copywriter since her son was born in 1991.

"What is fun about copywriting is that you get to learn a little about a lot of different things," Bonasia said. 

Cindy Chinelly, one of Bonasia's undergraduate creative writing professors, described her as highly motivated, well-read, and generous when providing criticism to others.

"By the last semester, I knew that she would be someone well-known in the publishing world," Chinelly said. "She knew how to bring her knowledge of the world into her stories and she was also a very good poet."

Chinelly said she is certain the book will have good reviews and is looking forward to reading it.

"Lynn's fiction deals with human conditions. It explores our fears, desires, and difficulties. That's what good fiction does; it changes the reader," Chinelly said. "Lynn has been more of an inspiration to me than what I could have been to her."

Lynne Barret, Bonasia's thesis director and professor of fiction workshops, said she read several drafts of the novel. She also advised Bonasia during the final changes, including changing the title from Washashores to Some Assembly Required. 

According to Barret, writing the thesis helped Bonasia to work on story construction, plot and action. 

"She came into our program already a fine writer of prose with a perceptive understanding of character," Barret said. "She is intelligent, disciplined and works very hard."

Barret said the novel has a complicated plot that mixes humor and loss. 

Bonasia is excited to be in print regardless of how critics may react to the work once it hits shelves. 

"It does tickle me that after this book comes out my obit can legitimately say 'Author Lynn Kiele Bonasia.' Even if the book is panned, no one can take that away from me," she said.

In her next novel, the setting is also in Cape Cod and is about a clam shack owner dealing with the sudden death of an employee that brings an old flame back into her life.

Headline: CRAZY CROCS: Shoes loved by many, shunned by others
Author: Olivia Camayd / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A decade ago when the word "croc" came up in conversation, most would immediately think of a crocodile, or Steve Irwin, depending on the accent used. In 2007, this is not the case. Now the word "croc" likely triggers the disturbing image of sunflower yellow, plastic clogs. So when did this transition happen and why would anyone ever resort to wearing such unappealing shoes? 

One reason could be their unmistakable comfort. Many students and retailers seem to stand by the claim that the shoe's comfort level surpasses its unattractive appearance. David Polanco, a vendor at a Miami Nordstrom, calls them "the ugliest, most comfortable shoes on the planet. I would not be caught dead wearing them in public, but they're the only shoes I wear at home."

Lyndon "Duke" Johnson founded Crocs, Inc. in 2002 in Boulder, Colorado. The original model, the Crocs Beach, was first sold that same year in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. During the subsequent years, Crocs have increased in popularity due in large part to word of mouth advertising about their impressive comfort (Jennifer Alsever "What a Croc!" fastcompany.com). In 2007, Crocs' revenue has increased a staggering 130% since last year. According to an October 31st press release from www.crocs.com/company/press, the company made a total of $256.3 million this year compared to last year's $111.3 million.

The shoes come in a variety of colors ranging from neutral black and gray to blindingly bright orange and lime green. In 2006, Crocs, Inc. further increased their variety by buying a company called Jibbitz, which allows their costumers to personalize their Crocs with an assortment of charms and embellishments. 

Crocs, Inc. owns several shoe companies that meet their customers' needs. For those customers who are more fashion conscious, YOU by Crocs is a more stylish take on the Crocs material. Its website (youbycrocs.com), claims it is the "intersection of fashion and Soleful comfort." 

Most FIU students who spoke to the Beacon showed an aversion toward the shoe. "They look comfortable, but disappointed me. I tried them on and [they were] unfashionable. I wouldn't spend money on them", says Derek Pacheco, a junior at FIU. Other students, like Amanda Hechavarria, have given the shoes a try only to find that they were less comfortable than advertised. "There are small bumps on the bottom of the shoes and an unpleasant breeze passes through your toes." Hechavarria said. 

Crocs not only face harsh criticism from students, but in the outside world as well. Hating Crocs has become as much of a trend as wearing them. Some have gone as far as making websites, such as ihatecrocs.blogspot.com, specifically to discuss the flaws of the shoes. This resistance against the Croc trend extends into the mainstream media. Megan O'Rourke of Slate went as far as calling the shoes "exquisitely ugly" in her article "The Croc Epidemic" and John Stewart from the popular faux news program "The Daily Show" has shown extraordinary distaste for the shoes. 

The war against Crocs was further fueled this past September, when news of a young boy named Rory's nearly had his toenail ripped off after his shoe got caught in an escalator (crocsaccidents.blogspot.com). Rory was not the first to suffer physical injury as a result of wearing Crocs. Earlier this year a little girl from Atlanta had to have two toes partially amputated after her Crocs got caught in an escalator at the airport. The accidents were due to the soft material of the shoes as well as the small shoe size of the children. 

In spite of the growing trend of disliking Crocs, the shoes' owners bravely stand by their purchases, countering with websites such as littlerubbershoes.com and boasting both the comfort and medical benefits of Crocs. 

Despite facing bad publicity and public distaste, Crocs continue to grow in popularity not only in the United States, but globally as well. They are currently being sold in 90 countries worldwide at a stunning rate of 60 million pairs a year. Local sales associates at department stores like Nordstrom and Macy's have been baffled by the amount of Crocs sold. Millicent, a salesperson at Macy's says, "Crocs sell like hot bread. It's like giving them away." This seems to be a clear message: whether you love them, or love to hate them, Crocs aren't going away anytime soon.

Headline: Japanese Fashion becomes popular  in U.S.
Author: Elyse Coleman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In the back of the December 2007 issue of Shojo Beat magazine, a publication featuring Japanese comics, or Manga, was an ad for a clothing brand called Baby, The Stars Shine Bright. 

The ad features the brand's upcoming line of "western size" clothing. Baby is one of Japan's major brand-name producers of "Lolita clothing," a style inspired by Victorian-era attire. Baby is one of various Lolita clothing brands currently opening their lines to international markets. 

In addition, Gothic & Lolita Bible, a popular Lolita fashion magazine in Japan, will soon be translated and distributed to American audiences courtesy of the English-language manga distributing company, Tokyopop.

"Lolita's got three things many other street styles don't have:" said, Michelle Holtkamp, a junior and president of the Japan Club, "one, it's cute; two, versatility; and three, celebrity support. The cute part's self-explanatory. You can just look at a loli outfit and feel just a little bit more bubbly inside because of it."

The growing popularity of the style in America is also in correlation with the rise in popularity of Japanese animation, or anime, and manga in the west. Many of these mediums, particularly those aimed at a female demographic, feature characters who wear clothing inspired by the trend.

Along with the rise of anime and manga, singer Gwen Stefani is also of noted as a major influence for bringing western attention to Japanese styles. The former lead vocalist of No Doubt released her own clothing line, L.A.M.B., in 2003. L.A.M.B. stands for "Love. Angel. Music. Baby.," both the name of Stefani's first solo album and the nicknames of her signature Japanese backup dancers, also known collectively as The Harajuku Girls. In 2005, Stefani launched Harajuku Lovers, a more mainstream-oriented line with products made and priced for the average consumer. 

In a 2005 interview with British newspaper The Observer, Gwen Stefani discusses her first visit to Harajuku, one of Japan's largest fashion districts and how its youth street fashion has come to inspire her style.

Along with lolita, Stefani also mentions "girls with blonde hair and dark tans and high heels, like they were from Hollywood," a reference to ganguro gyaru, a trend that peaked in the early 2000s where girls would bleach and/or dye their hair, tan their skin, and wear white make-up and bright, flashy clothing and accessories. 

In actuality, gyaru borrows quite a bit from western appearances, according to Joelle Davis, a moderator of the Ganguro on LiveJournal (http://community.livejournal.com/ganguro).

"I heard long ago that gyaru is a sort of rebellion against the conformity that Japanese culture and society pressed on its citizens, and in being so, we see a more western look across the nation." 

We see it...in the designer bags, blonde and brown hair. [Some look to] many western popstars in magazines for style inspiration."

Other Japanese fashion trends have also been inspired by American fashion such as b?s?zoku, a style that began in the 1950s, which translates to "violent running tribe."

According to a January 2007 article in Japan Today, b?s?zoku is inspired by the greasers of the 1950s who became known to the Japanese youth through biker films such as The Wild One starring Marlon Brando.

While L.A.M.B. and Harajuku lovers have received great appraise from fashion critics, such as those at Entertainment Weekly and Style.com, purists of these fashions have differentiating opinions:

"Personally, I don't like it at all," says Davis. "I think it's distasteful and exploits the unique style found in the streets of Harajuku,"

However, not everyone feels so negatively about the incorporation of Japanese styles into the western world.

"Since big names like Vuitton and Stefani see the fashions as something worth incorporating into their own designs, that shows a significant public demand for the Japanese street look, even if the people buying those clothes may not know where the roots of the 'new look' come from."

Headline: Want free shirts? Join the club!
Subheadline: Clubs use students as billboards
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Free t-shirts are a staple of campus life. They provide a way to show pride for the University, represent which events you have attended, what organizations you are involved with and provide an alternative to doing laundry or buying new clothes.

Campus organizations often garner attention about their causes and attract attention to their events by spending money on t-shirts to promote events beforehand and to hand out at activities.

Alejandra Maruri, president of the Student Alumni Association, said that even though shirts can be "pricey," they are worth it. 

"They are an attractive factor for students. What else does a college student want besides free shirts and free food?" Maruri said.

Rose Pereira, a computer-engineering student, wears FIU shirts at least twice a week so obtaining free shirts are a must for her.

"I wear [FIU shirts] to class, to hang out and some with my pajamas. They are an important part of my wardrobe," said Pereira.

Although producing the shirts can prove expensive for clubs, there are ways to offset the costs. 

In a campus with hundreds of organizations registered with the Student Organizations Council, name recognition is important. T-shirts turn students into human billboards for these clubs.

"Sometimes we get sponsors, so the cost of the shirts is not out of our pocket," said Maruri.For some students, however, free t-shirts are not about the threads themselves, but the sense of accomplishment of receiving one.

"Everyone wants a shirt at events, and when it's you that ends up grabbing it out of the air, you feel like you won," said Niko Votipka, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering.

There are many opportunities year-round to find some free clothing. "Panthers Unleashed" shirts were a common sight during Homecoming where the Homecoming Council gave out the shirts at sponsored events, last Friday, the Career Services office was passing out free FIU Football shirts which read "Give 'Em The Paw 2007" to students passing through Graham Center all day during Homecoming Court voting.

"[Sponsoring the free shirts] has been a great experience because this opportunity has allowed our office to have face-to-face contact with many different student populations throughout the campus community," said Shawna McNair, Assistant Director of Career Services, in a press release.

Students interested in getting free shirts can follow these tips to score some:

Join clubs. Check the SOC Web site and get active. Shirts are usually included in the cost for memberships at some clubs. Just make sure you actually attend a few meetings so other members don't wonder who you are and why you're wearing their shirt when they pass you in the hall.

Attend advertised events. Trail of the Torch, Freshman Convocation, Rage Week events, and others that have flyers and posters littered around campus are likely to have shirts involved.

Attend Panther Rage meetings. This organization is, other than fraternities and sororities, perhaps the most visible around campus in terms of Golden Panther Gear.  "Roary is my Homeboy" shirts are all the "Rage" at FIU.

Be loud and proud. Most of the time, getting a shirt thrown to you requires a bit of yelling.

Steal it from your roommate's drawer (not recommended)

If you simply cannot seem to get lucky with scoring free shirts or simply want to expand your collection, the FIU Bookstore has a wide selection of FIU gear that can be used to show your Golden Panther Pride, ranging from the very reasonably priced to the "more overpriced than a University of Miami education" category.

Headline: Model of Health...a wellness column: HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD?  HIV contaminated organs raise questions
Author: Sandra Mateu / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Earlier this month a horrible story came out of Chicago. Four patients got infected with HIV and the virus for hepatitis C from an organ donor. 

The recipients discovered that they were infected with HIV two weeks ago, according to medical officials reported by Associated Press; the transplants took place in January, but the recipients were not tested for HIV until recently.

According to MedicalNewsToday.com the organ donor had been tested by an ELISA test before the transplant, which is a fast HIV test that screens for antibodies. The results came out negative.  

This test was repeated after the infections were discovered and the result came out negative too.

The most likely reason the test came out negative is because the donor had acquired the infection in the last three weeks before death, according to AP. 

If a person gets infected with HIV, it takes 22 days from time of exposure to be detected by the standard HIV test (ELISA).

Another important issue is that the donor was identified in a high-risk status, which was confirmed on a questionnaire before the transplant. 

"We were aware of that from the beginning," said Dave Bosch of the Gift of Hope Organ and Tissue Donation, the regional organ procurement agency that handled the donor organs in article from the Reuters news agency. 

According to Bosch, 9 percent of the 22,000 organ transplants in the United States involve high-risk organs. 

Statistics reflect that the risk of getting any disease from transplanted organs is less than 0.01 percent, according to Tanner. 

"The transplant system is safe," according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

According to AP, behaviors that may make a potential donor's organs "high risk" include having unprotected sex, having sex for money or drugs, and intravenous use of recreational drugs, within the past five years prior to organ donation.

Three main ethical questions arise from all these facts. 

Isn't there another test  more accurate than the ELISA test?  And why were the recipients not tested for HIV after the transplant?

To start, there is another type of test that is more accurate known as NAT, which is a slower test that looks at the genetic material of the HIV or hepatitis C pathogen, and can therefore detect the presence of a virus shortly after infection, before the body has had time to produce enough antibodies to show up in the antibody test, according to MedicalNewsToday.com.

  The problem is that this test takes longer than the ELISA test, and since time is essential they apply the ELISA test. 

According to an article in the Chicago Tribune titled "Organ Patients spread of HIV probed," organs can be stored only for a short time, as little as four hours in the case of hearts and lungs, experts said. 

The availability is another concern. If you pass, maybe you don't get another organ, according to Caplan, University of Pennsylvania medical ethicist. 

 Another question remains: why weren't the recipients tested after the procedure? According to Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, director of blood, organ and tissue safety with the federal Center for Disease Control, none of the affected hospitals -Rush University Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the University of Chicago Medical Center- appeared to have followed CDC guidelines for testing at-risk patients after a transplant.

Gift of Hope in a statement on their website www.giftofhope.org, affirms that a review of the case verified that they performed standard tests for HIV and HCV in accordance with the appropriate guidelines as required by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) and the CDC.

As for the recipients friends and family? According to the Chicago Tribune, it's too soon to say whether the organ recipients passed on the infections to anyone else.

Is there a transplant system that is 100 percent secure that can someday be implemented?

"I predict it will happen. We're just not there today. I hope it won't be too long…maybe a year or two," said James Burdick, head of the division of transplantation at the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.

Headline: Phones to be installed in all classes by '08: Emergency calling system to increase safety, awarness
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
FIU is in the process of a three-phase project that will see telephones installed in every classroom and lab at the University.

University officials had initially talked about the idea, but expedited the process after school officials at Virginia Tech said more lives could have been saved had there been a better way to inform those in classrooms about the gunman on campus.

"After Virginia Tech, this was made a commitment by President Maidique and it's going to be a good addition because it will add an extra resource for students in emergency situations," Director of Public Safety Bill King said.

Phase one will have phones in 77 classrooms in Primera Casa, Graham Center, Academic I and Academic II and should be completed by the end of December, according to Charles Cyrille, FIU's emergency management coordinator. Students and faculty will be able to call 9-1-1 or public safety from any of the phones. 

Signs will be posted next to each phone with emergency numbers such as those for the Department of Public Safety at University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus. 

In the event of a emergency, each phone will broadcast an emergency message informing students, faculty and administration that there is an emergency or threat of some sort.

"The ultimate goal is to have phones in all classrooms and labs," Cyrille said. 

Funding for the project comes from a $250,000 grant received from the State.

According to Cyrille, the grant would be more than enough cover the costs of purchasing and installing the phones in all classrooms and labs.

University Technological Services is currently working with Public Safety and hopes to complete the project by the end of the Spring semester. 

During phase-two, Cyrille said that phones will be implemented into the Green Library, BBC Library, and Deuxieme Maison at a minimum.

The final phase of the project will focus on putting speakers in larger indoor areas. All phones should be implemented and functional by the end of the Spring semester according to Cyrille.

The University is also considering ways to send mass text messages to students in case of an emergency. 

One of the options includes amending the University's current contract with Message One. 

The second option consists of adopting Miami-Dade County's messaging system. 

If the University were to choose the county's messaging system, students would receive text messages with emergency notifications originating at both the county and the University levels. 

Students would have to opt-in the messaging system option through PantherSoft to receive the messages.

"The important thing is that students can update their information at anytime on PantherSoft and will be reminded at the beginning or end of the semester to update their information," Cyrille said.

Headline: National Health Occupations Students of America: GETTING PHYSICAL
Subheadline: Pre-medical society serves community
Author: Nadia Kijanka / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Jessica Browne, a health sciences major, was looking for a club that would give students who are interested in health a chance to make a difference.

The senior eventually teamed up with other students and faculty to establish an FIU Health Occupations Students of America organization chapter, which she is now president of.

Professors Barbara Anderson and Carol Pyle became the faculty advisors and a full committee of students soon followed.

According to Browne, the best thing about FIU's HOSA is that it is open to all students. 

The club's members include pre-medicine, pre-occupational therapy and pre-dentistry students, as well as others who are not entering the health field. 

"HOSA allows everyone to get together and see what it is like to work in the field and make contacts. Health care is all about team effort. 

You need to learn that taking care of a patient is a collaborative effort and that's what HOSA is all about," Browne said.

Sophomore Eddy Mora, a biology major, remembers when he first got involved in HOSA.

"I found out about FIU HOSA one day in Fall 2006 while walking through the Graham Center. There was a table there and I stopped and asked about it, since there was a HOSA club in my high school," Mora said. 

I remember I got two roses, and that made my day. Since then I've met a lot of interesting, fun and caring people both in the club and out of the club."

This year, the National HOSA decided to focus on fund raising for Autism Speaks, the nation's leading non-profit organization devoted to autism research and education. 

FIU's HOSA raised roughly $400 for the organization.

"We fund raise for autism because it has been the focus of the National HOSA for the past two years."

We spread awareness for autism because most people don't understand it," Browne said. 

It needs to be addressed in our society in order for us to help autistic people."

Senior Melissa Burgos, a health science major, said she enjoyed fund raising for Autism Speaks, during National HOSA Week Nov. 5 through Nov. 9.

"It was great to be a part of a project that made a difference for many autistic children," Burgos said.

FIU's HOSA has also teamed up with other organizations such as the Children's Miracle Network to raise money in a toy sale. 

The club also paired up with Sigma Omega Zeta to raise $1,171 for the American Cancer Society's Making Strides against Breast Cancer.

Members of FIU HOSA, such as junior Nora Contreras, a Health Sciences major, said that they enjoy the chance to make new friends and network within the community through their club.

"Since I live in Broward, I don't spend that much time on campus, but being in HOSA and attending the events helps me meet new people and make new friends," Contreras said.

FIU HOSA hosts several social events for its members including banquets, movies and social nights.

Senior Sukaya Devot, a health science major, said she enjoys the social aspect of FIU HOSA.

"I like to be involved in various activities that will benefit others and the social events are really fun too," Devot said. 

I know that whatever event I go to I will have a great time."

The club will hold its last meeting for the Fall semester and the executive board elections for the upcoming semester Nov. 28. 

The new president of the club will be Christy Ribao, a Health Sciences major and pre-med student since Browne is graduating this semester. 

"I hope to continue the success that HOSA has had so far by putting more emphasis on community service and giving our members the opportunity to meet and work with health care professionals in the area," Ribao said.

Headline: HAND OFF: Hugging banned at middle school
Author: Joseph Marhee / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you tell them not to do it, they'll just want to do it more.

We have all heard that phrase in reference to just about anything from marijuana, bullying or any 'unacceptable' act. 

But now this phrase can extend itself to the most publicly explicit, and the most overt display of teenage sexuality currently rampaging in America's schools: the hug. 

Schools in America have always been 'on the fence' about public displays of affection (i.e. open mouth kissing in the halls), but Fossil Hills Middle School in North Texas believes that hugging is everything short of public fornication.

"Would you want your children to be hugging or kissing at school without your knowledge?" said David Hadley, the principal of Fossil Hills Middle School.  

Consequently, Hadley has (inadvertently or not) made something non-sexual into an offense punishable by detention, and in cases of "extreme hugging," as one Illinois middle school principal put it, suspension. 

While the policy may seem slightly authoritarian, the policy-makers are acting with good intentions. 

"Middle school is the age where these children start to form their ideas of sexuality and what it means to be an adult," said Heather Stein, FIU student majoring in health science. "But they [can] take it to the extreme."

If the schools were to draw the line at kissing, it would be reasonable since certain sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted orally. 

Whereas hugging holds no more danger than accidently bumping into someone or being pressed against in a large crowd.

However, junior Nathalie Jolain can elaborate on what can be considered extreme behavior.

Jolain, who attended Saint Michael's Middle school, recalls, "some girl getting felt up by the bleachers, under her skirt." Nor can she  ever forget, "this guy who would whip out his [genitals] in class."  

With that said, this policy is mainly being applied to middle schools specifically for these reasons. 

The policy is a double-edged sword, though. 

With physical contact banned, these students will most likely come to class on time without two lip-locked pre-teens blocking the hallways.

On the other hand, students "may develop long-term intimacy issues stemming from the discouragement to make even friendly, social physical contact like hand-shakes, [and] pats on the back," said Lawrin Riles, a Kilmer Middle School parent.

Sophomore Jennifer Laban agrees. 

"Omitting hugging from a middle school setting will lead us to 30 year olds who don't know how to physically connect," Laban said. 

Natasha Lisby, a junior, also agrees this ban could also lead to future social problems. 

"At such an impressionable age, to teach kids to fear and avoid physical contact with others can impede their sexual and emotional maturity," Lisby said.

These polices speak volumes about a growing puritanical trend toward public displays of affection and what is deemed appropriate. It feels like we are retreating back to the '50s when holding hands was a scandalous act.

Fossil Hills Middle in Texas may have good intentions, but where will the good be when their students become socially awkward and fear to show a simple sign of affection in the form of a harmless, two-second hug?

Headline: Commentary: University Apartments poorly maintained, unclean
Author: David Copeland / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As I checked-in to my dorm in the University Park Apartments earlier this semester, the scene I came across met my expectations most adequately: the tile floor was noticeably old, scratched here and there in hundreds of places and seemingly filthy beyond any standard method of cleaning. 

The stove-top was spotted with the burnt flakes of unknown meals from countless other tenants and missing one of the heat coils. A rather large piece of the ceiling had been casually left to blend in with the grime of the floor. None of this surprised me.  

This is my second semester living in one of the University Park apartments. As such, my firsthand knowledge of the overall living conditions of UPA - when compared to the other newer and, apparently, more important residence halls in campus - has prepared me for my experiences with my dorm, and the housing department.

To be fair it should be noted that any experience is in part what one makes of it.  

Despite the state of the apartments, living on campus, specifically UPA, is not a miserable experience. 

There is a fairly vibrant life and energy within the UPA community through numerous events held throughout the semester.

The apartments make provisions so that it is possible for individuals to develop a sense of living as a part of the UPA community.

That said, the discrepancy in the living conditions between UPA and other residence halls is obvious among most residents, as they go well beyond any expected or fair differences. 

The age of the apartments is at fault for the state. The neglect has not been addressed, possibly due to the construction of newer, more profitable dorms.

The sheer squalor and broken down state of certain rooms still permeates even after the resident and roommates have taken it upon themselves to clean their dorm after moving in.  

These efforts are often in vain since the check-out policy, a policy that exists to hold tenants accountable for any damages that might have occurred throughout their stay, is loosely enforced, if at all. 

This results in stubborn spots of grime on the floor, large patches of mildew near the central air vents (which seems like a health hazard) and the notorious shower tubs, which will have you considering a second shower soon after your first. 

Clearly it is the residents' duty to maintain their dorms, but it is not their duty to clean the filth of previous residents - especially right after check-in.  

By placing the responsibility of cleaning the dorms solely on students, Housing cunningly avoids having to take any responsibility for the state of the rooms they offer.

If the check-in policy were strictly enforced, students would have to take note of problems as soon as they checked in and could then complain about the state of their rooms.  

These students would therefore have to record the condition of their rooms upon arrival and how these issues were never resolved, thereby making Housing responsible.

As residents of UPA, most of us understand that you get what you pay for. 

We don't hold unrealistic expectations of what the apartments should be like, but we deserve equality and fairness in policy when it comes to, if nothing else, the simple functionality and cleanliness of our dorms.  

We don't pay at least $2,000 to be repulsed by what is to be our own living space for the entire semester.

Headline: Men's BASKETBALL USF 77, FIU 69: FIRST DEFEAT
Subheadline: Team unable to stop Bulls' inside game
Author: Jonathan Ramos / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With 5:38 left in the game, University of South Florida center Kentrell Gransberry got in postion inside the paint and scored once again before clapping his hands confidently and jogging to his huddle after another FIU timeout.

For the Golden Panthers (2-1), that play was a microcosm of the teams 77-69 loss to the USF Bulls (4-3) Nov. 26 at the Pharmed Arena.

Gransberry, a second team All-Big East selection last season, led the Bulls with 21 points on 8-for-13 shooting from the field, and was a force on both sides of the ball.

"He's amazing, we just have to get him the ball and he does what he needs to," USF forward Orane Chin said.

Indeed. Gransberry was the center of attention for the Golden Panthers defense, often drawing double teams en route to getting to the line 10 times to lead his team. 

The Golden Panthers went 7-for-13 at the line for the game as the Bulls capitalized throughout the game on their way to an 18-for-29 night at the stripe. Gransberry, the top returning rebounder in the nation coming into the season, also disrupted the Golden Panthers in the paint where he led the Bulls with two blocks and grabbed six rebounds. The preseason candidate for the John R. Wooden award was one of the main reasons the Golden Panthers could not find a rhythm in the post.

FIU coach Sergio Rouco thought his team did not play hard enough.

"They were soft," he said.  "They haven't been soft now, but we haven't played a team of this magnitude yet. I thought we could have played harder around the basket, but we didn't, and they took advantage of that ."

Starting center Russell Hicks, who came into the game leading the team in scoring at 17 points per game, never found an offensive rhythm. He finished with 11 points on 5-for-13 shooting.

"I couldn't finish," Hicks said. "I know that in the first half I couldn't even finish my close range shots."

Rouco believes Hicks could have been more intense.

"We tried to get him the ball early and he couldn't catch it," Rouco said. "He wasn't as intense the first half as he was the second half, but he's our center he has to catch the ball and be a presence offensively. I thought he had times offensively where he could have dunked the ball and he didn't, so he has to play stronger"

As a result of the Bulls' sturdy play inside, the Golden Panthers were forced to shoot a season-high 24 3-point field goals, while only making eight of them. 

Junior guard Kenneth White contributed to the Golden Panthers' poor shooting night, going 1-for-7 from 3-point range and made only six field goals in 21 attempts for the game.

"It was his day; he was open," Rouco said of White. "I thought out of the shots he took, a few were forced, but he missed a lot of shots around the basket and he's a guy we need to be offensive minded for us to win."

When USF did take a 3-point shot, they made it. Jesus Verdejo made all of the Bulls 3-pointers on the day as he went 3-for-4 from behind the arc. He finished the game with 15 points.

The combination of USF's inside dominance and FIU's perimeter friendly play led to the Bulls shooting 53.8 percent for the game as opposed to the Golden Panthers 38.9 percent. Even with a worse shooting percentage, the Golden Panthers were able to keep the game close throughout as the Bulls never led by more than 10 points. 

The Golden Panthers jumped to a 20-13 lead, their largest lead of the game, with 11:43 left in the first half led after guard Chris Fuller's eight early points. But after a layup by FIU point guard Michael James to make it 26-20, the Bulls went on a 8-0 run in which they took a lead they held for the rest of the game. 

The Golden Panthers fought back to make it a two-point deficit with 6:08 left to play, but USF held on to preserve their fourth straight victory.

Rouco believes his team must get used to playing teams of USF's caliber after a few easy early season victories.

"We'll get better and our guys have to get stronger if we are going to beat bigger league teams," he said. "Were not playing Florida Tech anymore."

Headline: Commentary: Newcomer needs ball for offense to succeed
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With president Modesto A. Maidique and athletic director Pete Garcia in attendance, the Golden Panthers' interior offensive game failed to gain any rhythm against their in-state foe, South Florida.

Consequently, the Bulls ended the Golden Panthers' hopes of winning their first three games of the season, instead handing them their first defeat 76-69 at the Pharmed Arena.

In addition to the administration, hundreds of Golden Panther fans watched their team broken apart by the Bulls' center Kentrell Gransberry. 

Gransberry bullied the team's most coveted newcomer, seven-footer Russell Hicks, outscoring him 21-11.

The transfer out of Pepperdine University could not stop Gransberry from consistently gaining inside position and scoring. After leading the team in scoring during the first two games of the season, Hicks did not score his first basket of the game until 3:39 left in the first half. 

There were two factors resulted in Hicks becoming obsolete. From the opening tip to the end of the final buzzer, the Golden Panthers relied heavily on outside shooting. In the beginning, it was working wonders for the offense as they made three consecutive 3-pointers. But as the game went on, the team began to shoot ill-advised shots and did not allow Hicks to touch the ball enough.

Secondly, the Bulls defense blocked passing lanes and forced other players to shoot the ball instead of Hicks. As a result, junior guard Kenneth White shot the ball 21 times as opposed to Hicks' 13 shots that were mainly tipped balls and not plays designed for him. 

Once Hicks was not a factor, the Bulls took advantage of a stagnant offense keep their lead. Coach Sergio Rouco needed to find a means of getting Hicks more involved in the game. 

Also, Rouco did not stress to his players the importance of getting their most dangerous offensive player, forward Alex Galindo, the ball.

If the Golden Panthers offense is going to succeed, Galindo and Hicks must take the most shots. 

Galindo's athleticism and outside shooting makes him the most versatile offensive threat on the team. The Golden Panthers offense looked confused and disorientated when he didn't control the ball. 

The Golden Panther's best offensive players need to be much more aggressive this season by going to the free-throw line more often. The duo only shot a combined four foul shots. They need to go to the free-throw line and make the opposing defense play much more cautiously. By just drawing one foul a piece, the Bulls' defense played with more liberty and physicality. 

Despite Gransberry's dominance, the Golden Panthers' defense did force more turnovers and cashed in more points off turnovers. 

The Golden Panthers' perimeter defenders, senior guards Chris Fuller and  Michael James, disrupted the Bulls' offense by applying suffocating pressure. 

The Bulls' offense could not carry out their intended gameplan when they applied the pressure. However, as the game waned so did the Golden Panthers' intensity. 

They were unable to sustain the same level of energy throughout the whole game.

This season's team has some new pieces that will have to mesh over time. 

White, a trigger-happy transfer from Texas A&M, will have to allow Hicks and Galindo to shoot more. 

Junior center Badara Ndiaye, who usually substitutes for Hicks, will have to get used to coming off the bench in the middle of the game and give his team productive minutes.

Rouco still has time to make all the pieces to the puzzle on his team fit, but with last season's 12-17 record, there is a bit more pressure on him to improve, especially with all the new weapons the team possesses. 

And especially if Garcia, who removed four head coaches in 13 months, does not see improvement.

Headline: Women's Basketball: Golden Panthers falter in FIU Thanksgiving Classic
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Pharmed Arena played host to the FIU Thanksgiving Classic Nov. 23 and 25. The Golden Panthers (1-4),  University of Providence Friars (4-2), University of South Carolina Gamecocks (4-2) and the University of Illinois Fighting Illini (5-1) participated in the tournament. 

The Golden Panthers got off to a promising start against Providence. They entered halftime with a 33-24 lead that would be short lived. Despite having a 14-point lead in the second half, a 15-0 run by Providence brought the lead up to 14 points in the second half. FIU lost after a 15-0 Providence run. 

The Golden Panthers ended up losing the game 71-60. Providence, led by sophomore guard Kendria Holmes, scored a game-high 19 points. 

Junior forward Marquita Adley led FIU in both scoring and rebounding with 12 points and a career-high 16 rebounds for the second consecutive game.    

"It was the defense. It was definitely the defense," said junior guard Iva Ciglar. "You can't blame it on the offense [because] you [can] have a good day or bad day on offense, but you always have to have a good day on defense and that is definitely what we did not have today."

The Golden Panthers then went on to beat Illinois, who had lost to South Carolina, 91-58. This meant FIU was to play South Carolina in the consolation game, while Providence and Illinois played for the tournament championship.

In the consolation game against South Carolina, the Golden Panthers would only lead briefly at the beginning as the Gamecocks scored consistently, mainly in the paint where they had a clear size advantage. At halftime, FIU trailed 34-42. 

In the second half, senior guard LaQuetta Ferguson scored 23 of her career-high 32 points and helped keep FIU within striking range, but South Carolina responded to every run and would end up winning 82-66.

Ferguson's career-high came following her toughest game of the season against Providence in which she only scored eight points and sustained a concussion towards the end of the game. 

"These loses are bad, but they're good because we learn with every loss and by the time we get in our conference, we'll be ready to compete and beat the teams in our conference," said Ferguson.

In the championship game, Illinois edged out Providence by one point to win 60-59

The all-tournament team consisted of Ferguson, South Carolina freshmen guard Jordan Jones, Providence sophomore forward Emily Cournoyer, Illinois Junior forward Chelsea Gorden and Smith.  

Golden Panthers coach Cindy Russo was pleased to face tough competition at this juncture of the season.

 "You know I was worried about that when I had the schedule and it can go two ways," Russo said.

"You can really get better and gain from it, win or lose, or it can crush them, but today I would say they are on the other side of the coin, meaning they are learning from it and getting better, so that makes me happy."

The Golden Panthers will be the University of South Florida on Nov. 29.

Headline: North Texas NOTEBOOK: Raw quarterbacks lead teams in final game
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
If the Golden Panthers hope to end their losing streak before a nine month hiatus until the start of the 2008 season, they will have just one chance to do it when the North Texas Mean Green (2-9) come to the Orange Bowl on Dec. 1. 

Despite their last three opponents having a combined record of just 14-21, the Golden Panthers have been unable to end their 23-game losing streak, which stretches back to the beginning of the 2006 season. 

While the offense has shown more life in those games than at any point in the season, the defense has also put the team in a hole, allowing 1,392 yards combined in the past three games, and that is a trend that looks like it will continue when the Mean Green come to the Orange Bowl. Despite its 2-9 record, the Mean Green boast the most formidable passing offense in the Sun Belt, ranking first in conference and 16th overall in the nation. 

If the Golden Panthers are going to stop the Mean Green offense, they will have to shut down junior wide receiver Casey Fitzgerald, who is third in the nation in receptions and fourth in receiving yards. On the season, Fitzgerald leads the Sun Belt with 104 receptions, 1,264 yards and 12 touchdowns. Fitzgerald has dominated vulnerable passing offenses all season, including a five-touchdown game against Navy, which North Texas lost 72-64.

The reason North Texas is 2-9 despite its high scoring offense, which ranks fourth in the Sun Belt in scoring, is their defense, which allows 45 points and 499 yards per game. If the Golden Panthers are going to beat NTU, their best bet is with a steady dose of junior running back A'Mod Ned and either sophomore quarterback Paul McCall or freshman quarterback Colt Anderson.

McCall or Anderson will have to take the place of starter Wayne Younger, who injured his collarbone during the team's 55-23 loss to the FAU Owls on Nov. 24. While Younger was known for his ability to make plays with his feet, McCall is more of a traditional pocket passer. Anderson can move, but he doesn't have the quickness of Younger. 

Neither has made much of a mark in limited playing time this year, though McCall did impress in the fourth quarter of the loss to FAU, going 23-for-35 with two touchdowns and one interception. Anderson probably has a more accurate arm than McCall and can certainly move in and out of the pocket more fluidly, but McCall looked much more comfortable than Anderson in the FAU game. 

Anderson had just three passing attempts, with one completion for 10 yards, and three rushes for three yards. He looked tentative with his passes and seemed reluctant to put the ball in the air, which may give Cristobal enough reason to start McCall and try to let the sophomore get into a rhythm.

Headline: Republican club revives, gains support
Author: Peter M.T. Agbeyegbe / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students with conservative political ideologies now have a home in the FIU College Republicans.

"Any political ideology is welcome," said Julio J. Ortiz, a member of the FCR. 

Ortiz considers himself a moderate Republican and does not favor politicians solely based on their party affiliation. 

"I think [Barack Obama] has a very comfortable presence, and I like [Rudy Giuliani's] views on a free market society and keeping government intervention out of people's pockets," Ortiz said. 

Political discussions are never lacking at a typical FCR meeting. 

"Politics are arguably the most important thing in this country since we live in a democracy," said Juanky Robiana, chair of the FCR. 

Robiana reestablished the FCR during Spring 2007 after the club became inactive.  

"The College Republicans have had a discontinuous history," Ortiz said.

Membership to the FCR is open to all FIU students, regardless of political affiliation. Democrats are encouraged to join as well, however, only Republican members can join the executive board. 

In meetings, members are given an issue to discuss and then debate on until the meeting is called to an end. But on Nov. 9, the debates spilled out of the typical meeting when Robiana participated in a debate held in the Graham Center against FIU College Democrats president Chris Cabral.

"Being involved in meetings is encouraged as long as three rules are observed: no yelling, no personal insults and no interruptions," Robiana said. 

Robiana warns that members don't hold back their political ideals during a debate. 

"Political science and international relations professors should be neutral when teaching their classes," Robiana said. "A person should say what they believe, and vote on what they believe." 

The primary goal of the FCR is  to raise political awareness and activism in students. In order to help reach that goal, the group invited various political figures to speak during their weekly meetings. 

"Students need to get involved, regardless of whether they're a Democrat or Republican," said Javier Correoso, a member of the FCR. "It's important for students to be active while in college."

The FCR have brought other guest speakers to their meetings. In the spring,  they invited Joe Garcia, Miami-Dade Democratic Party Chairman, to debate the Cuban Embargo with Ana Carbonell, a Congressional Staffer. They also invited Congresswomen Ileana Ros-Lehtinen to discuss the crisis in Darfur, and her husband Dexter Lehtinen to compare Iraq with Vietnam.

According to Robiana, there isn't enough empathy in politics. 

 "The answer is to be nice to your neighbor, and receive the same in return," Robiana said. "The views of the College Republicans do not necessarily align with the national politics. It varies based on the issues, because all politics is local."

The College Republicans believe that there might be a problem with radical individualism. 

"The whole communal spirit of democracy doesn't work if people are saying that what happens to you doesn't matter, what happens to me is more important," Robiana said.

The FIU College Republicans meet every Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Primera Casa room 424. For more information on the group e-mail collegerepublicansfiu@gmail.com or visit www.fiu.edu/~soc.

Headline: Professor to establish educational link with Asia
Author: David X. Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Krishnan Dandapani catches his students off guard with unexpected jokes that intersperse his systematic teaching in his financial markets and institutions class at University Park campus. 

"He shares a lot of real world information and is very dynamic in his teaching," Ikua Karanja, graduate student in Dandapani's class.

In his 23 years at FIU, Dandapani a professor of finance in the College of Business Administration, has co-directed the Asian Studies Center at FIU, been a part of an academic hurricane task force, written numerous books and was a recipient of the Outstanding 100 award and $10,000 for research at Faculty Convocation on Oct 5.

"I have had tremendous support from both the community as well as the University and a chance to work with great people," Dandapani said.

Dandapani feels that FIU, being an international university, has mainly focused on the Caribbean and Latin America but with future growth at hand in China and India, he has great expectations for the University.

According to Dandapani's research, Asia's population  is growing at an average rate of 10 percent, while the rest of the world is growing at only 3 to 4 percent. 

That's why Dandapani felt a focus on Asia was important and, in 1997, was the first co-director for the Asian Studies Center. 

The focus on Asia was also resonated by President Modesto Maidique when he went to alumni meetings in Taiwan, Korea, and China and was astounded by the sheer number of alumni there.

Maidique jokingly remarked to Dandapani when he returned that there were probably more alumni in Asia than he would see in Miami. 

Currently, Dandapani the conference chair of an International Conference on Emerging Financial Markets that will be organized by the PSG Institute of Management, a major management institute in India. 

"We want to strategically position our self for the future," Dandapani said.

This International Conference is sponsored by many organizations, including FIU's Center for International Business Education and Research. 

CIBER is a federally funded research center in the United States that seeks to make educational and research ties around the world. 

Along with forming educational bonds, Dandapani has co-authored two books, The Return Generating Models in Global Finance and Banking in North America. 

Dandapani is currently putting the finishing touches on his third and fourth books, which are expected to come out in 2008. 

His third book, Financial Fraud: Process, Pattern and Prevention, is primarily centered on educating the individual against frauds like the "Nigerian Chain Letter."

"You need to educate yourself to avoid potential scams and financial pitfalls," Dandapani said.

Dandapani's fourth book, Financial Strategies for Mitigating Hurricane Risks, came from his experience as part of an academic hurricane task force after Hurricane Andrew. 

After Andrew's devastation, the task force avoided having insurance companies leave Florida by diversifying the risks associated with hurricanes.

Dandapani recently added another accomplishment to add to his list: he is the second person in the Department of Finance to receive the lucrative Outstanding 100 award.

"The finance department is the only department in FIU to have won the outstanding 100 award twice," William Welch, Chair of the Department of Finance, said. "[Dandapani] doesn't let opportunities pass."

Headline: Music business class releases CD
Author: Lauren Agosto  / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Music Management class taught by Professor Osawaldo Rossi will release the class-produced album "Secrets of Sound," on Nov. 30.

Rossi, who is the director of legal and business affairs for EMI Televisa Music has produced three albums so far in his classes.

"While I was putting together my syllabus, I asked myself, 'what kind of approach would I appreciate if I were a student longing to work in the music industry?' I figured ... this would give the students real insight on what goes behind producing, marketing and promoting an album," Rossi said.

The event will include several performances by locals artists:  Artofficial, a hip-hop fusion band with a Roots meets Beastie Boys flavor, Joseph "Onkore" Hernandez, a rapper who brings fresh new vibes to the hip-hop world and Like The TV Show, a poppy rock band with a strong fan base at University of Miami. 

"I've learned that its fast paced and a lot of more intricate than I thought it would be, but fun at the same time. One thing I'm surprise to learn is how much teamwork is emphasized on and how crucial building relationships are; you may not like someone, but one day you might need their help, so be nice," said Rosalyn Delgado, who has been working on Secrets of Sound this semester.

Rossi feels the album is beneficial to his students and their curriculum. 

"It allows them to celebrate the fruit of their efforts. I have seen it every semester; it is the one night of the semester where they see that their hard work resulted in a beautiful project and experience," Rossi said.

"In creating the album, I learned that our work isn't really completed until you have the final product in your hands. Surprises always come about when you least expect it," said Jackie Gadea, another student in the class.

The album is a multi-artist, multi-genre compilation album, which, according to Rossi, allows each student to contribute and illustrates the diversity of his class, while providing a mixture of sounds for everyone.

 The Secrets of Sound CD release party will be held Nov. 30 at Flavour Nightclub located at 2895   Road, Coconut Grove at 9 p.m.

The event is free and open to everyone 18 years and up.
